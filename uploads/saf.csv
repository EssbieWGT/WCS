Announced in Parliament this week, the measures are designed to cement Britain’s place as a leader in the production of SAF.
“I want to see a golden age for green aviation and today sees take off for sustainable flights,” he said.
The legislation also supports compliance with the UK’s SAF Mandate, which requires 10% of jet fuel used on UK flights to be sustainable by 2030, rising to 22% by 2040.
SAF is a crucial element in the plan to decarbonise aviation… this legislation will help to do that.”","The UK has introduced new legislation aimed at accelerating the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Announced in Parliament this week, the measures are designed to cement Britain’s place as a leader in the production of SAF.

Aviation Minister Mike Kane described the policy as a “take off” moment for sustainable flight, hailing the new regulations as central to a wider push to decarbonise the sector.

“I want to see a golden age for green aviation and today sees take off for sustainable flights,” he said. “We are making the UK one of the best places in the world to produce sustainable aviation fuel, putting the pedal down on growth and boosting job opportunities across the country as part of the Plan for Change.”

Underpinning the package is a revenue certainty mechanism (RCM), funded by a levy on aviation fuel suppliers, which will provide price stability for SAF producers while capping the impact on ticket prices to an average of £1.50 per year. This gives fuel developers the confidence to scale up operations without passing significant costs.

Some £400,000 in new government funding has been earmarked to fast-track the certification and market readiness of new SAF technologies. This follows £63 million allocated earlier this year via the Advanced Fuels Fund.

The legislation also supports compliance with the UK’s SAF Mandate, which requires 10% of jet fuel used on UK flights to be sustainable by 2030, rising to 22% by 2040.

Industry figures have welcomed the move. Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK, said: “This is a welcome announcement given the importance of the RCM to commercialising and scaling-up SAF production in the UK, a technology key to decarbonising aviation by 2050.”

Duncan McCourt, CEO of Sustainable Aviation, added: “We hugely welcome the publication of this important legislation. SAF is a crucial element in the plan to decarbonise aviation… this legislation will help to do that.”",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AdobeStock_466449834-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-05-16 15:56:24.789510

The company is seeing early success in selling low-carbon fuels and has plans to make the business profitable in the future.

Notably, tax credits, project funding, and small SAF plant installations are driving its growth. These efforts will also help Gevo grow in the SAF market and reach its sustainability goals.

Gevo’s Revenue Surges on Acquisition, RNG Growth, and Carbon Credit Gains

Gevo’s Q1 2025 revenue hit $30.9 million, a significant increase from last year. This growth includes $22.8 million from the newly acquired Gevo North Dakota. It also features gains in renewable natural gas (RNG) and environmental credits.

The RNG segment earned $5.7 million, up $1.7 million from last year. This boost came from a favorable carbon intensity (CI) score from California’s LCFS program.

Environmental attributes sales totaled $5.4 million.

Gevo North Dakota produced 11.1 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol and sequestered about 29,000 metric tons of CO2.

RNG output reached 79,963 MMBtu, resulting in over 60,000 metric tons of LCFS credits.

Carbon Abatement Gains Market Traction

In Q1, Gevo recorded over 100,000 metric tons of carbon abatement, now viewed as a marketable product. This includes captured and sequestered carbon, plus emissions avoided from using low-carbon fuels. The company expects Section 45Z tax credits to further enhance its adjusted EBITDA in 2025.

Dr. Patrick Gruber, Gevo’s Chief Executive Officer, commented,

“We believe we can get to positive Adjusted EBITDA this year for the company. This is in spite of the perceived headwinds and noise in the marketplace. We have real products to sell now that we own our North Dakota plant. Gevo North Dakota produces ethanol, animal feed, corn oil, and importantly, carbon abatement. The carbon abatement value is generated by capturing CO2 and sending it more than a mile underground into what we think is the best well (or sequestration site) in the country. Having this carbon abatement available to us has opened up new doors in the marketplace as customers and partners don’t have to wait around for synthetic aviation fuel (“SAF”) projects to be built to start developing the market in a real sense. We have approval from the Internal Revenue Service to apply for the Section 45Z tax credit, so we will do that, and that should help meet our Adjusted EBITDA goals.”

New Jet Fuel Offtake Deals Signal Growth Path

In April, Gevo secured two new offtake agreements:

Future Energy Global (FEG) signed for 10 million gallons/year of SAF and its Scope 1 and 3 emissions credits.

Another buyer committed to 5 million gallons/year of SAF, separate from the associated carbon abatement credits.

These deals will help fund Gevo’s upcoming ATJ projects in the Dakotas, including the 30 MGPY modular ATJ-30 facility, which is already 50% contracted.

Dr. Gruber further emphasized that Gevo stands out in the ATJ space by using proven, scalable technologies to produce high-yield, low-cost jet fuel with a low carbon intensity. Backed by 100+ patents, Gevo’s innovation attracted Axens, which licensed Gevo’s advanced ATJ processes.

Gevo is Paving the Way for a Low-Carbon Future

Gevo is a pioneer in low-carbon fuels and chemicals from renewable sources. Its advanced technology makes Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), motor fuels, and eco-friendly materials. These products work well with current engines and infrastructure. This ensures an easy transition from fossil fuels.

Patented Ethanol-to-Olefins (ETO) process

In September, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted Gevo a patent (U.S. Patent No. 12,043,587 B2) for its Ethanol-to-Olefins (ETO) process. This boosts its role in renewable fuels. This patent protects their advanced catalyst technology that efficiently converts ethanol into olefins.

Gevo’s SAF Technology

Gevo and LG Chem are collaborating to scale this process for chemical use. They want to improve the technology for business use. This creates a greener option to regular petrochemical olefins.

Their goal is to streamline fuel production by making larger olefins directly from ethanol in one step. These olefins can then be turned into transportation fuels using proven refining methods.

This innovation boosts efficiency, cuts energy use, and lowers costs. Most importantly, it helps achieve zero or even negative carbon emissions, making biofuels more sustainable.

SAF: The New Path to Net Zero

Through its Verity subsidiary, Gevo ensures transparency in sustainability tracking. As global jet fuel demand rises, SAF presents a significant opportunity to cut emissions and promote a cleaner future.

Its proprietary ATJ technology is a game changer for its cost efficiency and environmental impact. It can produce jet fuel at prices competitive with traditional oil-based options while achieving ultra-low to net-zero carbon intensity.

The system can offset over 600,000 metric tons of CO₂ annually—three times more carbon than the amount of fuel produced.

It cuts fossil natural gas use by 65%, making it highly energy-efficient.

Thus, cutting carbon emissions through renewable fuels and chemicals is their main goal. Gevo runs one of the biggest dairy-based renewable natural gas plants in the U.S. It also has an ethanol plant that uses carbon capture technology.

With active carbon capture, proven SAF pathways, and new market partnerships, Gevo can expand its renewable energy business and reach profitability this year.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2304873649.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 13:56:35.872148

Adrian Del Maestro is global energy advisory lead for AECOM, an engineering and construction firm.

Just a few years ago, a net-zero future felt almost certain. From the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States to the European Green New Deal, major economies leaped forward in a burst of green optimism. Even limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius seemed possible.

However, 2025 feels quite different.

An emerging array of tariffs is set to complicate the economics of low-carbon projects; geopolitical tensions have led many governments to refocus investment on new defense imperatives, perhaps to the detriment of transition spend; and more broadly, energy resilience is dominating national and corporate agendas, meaning natural gas and nuclear are rising to prominence.

Net-zero, it seems, is entering a reset. And the data bears that out.

Though clean energy investment totaled an impressive $2.1 trillion in 2024, growth in spending roughly halved compared to the three years prior. Even as investment in solar and wind continues to increase, spending on emerging transition technologies like carbon capture and storage (CCS) and hydrogen dropped by 23% in 2024.

If this reset gathers momentum, the implications will prove severe in the short- to medium-term. It will have a range of adverse impacts, from accelerating climate change to undermining the adoption of critical transition technologies.

Getting net-zero back on track will not be straightforward. Yet there is still time for a course correct. This will require a renewed emphasis on energy resilience, one that refocuses limited resources on key technologies while removing barriers to what is already profitable.

For governments, it is important to retain their long-term focus on delivering net-zero — whatever the short-term priorities around profitability that shape corporate thinking. That starts with enabling technologies.

Grid modernization, for instance, must remain a key priority. Not only does it support ongoing electrification, but also cuts across all forms of energy and electrification trends. Sustaining grid modernization efforts will require a range of policy decisions, from accelerating permitting to enable grid connections to increased community stakeholder engagement, to ensure projects are delivered swiftly. In the UK for example, the Planning and Infrastructure Bill will be critical to enabling the “Clean Power by 2030” ambition. The bill will prioritize connections to projects that are ready to go rather than speculative ones under the former “first come, first served” process. In tandem with investment in grid infrastructure, countries and their respective regulators should continue to promote energy storage solutions, from batteries to pumped hydro, to address the challenge of intermittency as renewables gain momentum.

These approaches will also accelerate some of today’s most commercially viable and competitive energy technologies: solar PV and wind. Too often, they can become stalled by lengthy permitting processes and regulatory hurdles. Clearing these barriers can help keep renewable capacity on track to triple by the end of the decade [1] while also bolstering resilience against surging energy demands and global instability.

Other sectors, however, will find it harder to electrify. Heavy industry, aviation and shipping all contribute significantly to global emissions yet remain difficult to abate. For example, in global aviation, as of 2024, sustainable aviation fuel production represented only about 0.5% of global jet fuel use. These sectors must remain the focus of government policymaking and, especially, increasingly limited public funding.

The challenge for heavy industry is linked to the fact that emerging technologies like CSS and hydrogen still face fundamental challenges around technology maturity, affordability and ability to scale up. As a result, government policymakers will need to do much more to de-risk these projects and stimulate consumer demand. This will be challenging given the macroeconomic environment. Historically, governments have focused subsidy support on encouraging the supply of hydrogen. However, given the paucity of final investment decisions in the sector, governments may need to focus more on stimulating demand for hydrogen. Such investment will prove essential for nations seeking to foster domestic options for low-carbon industrial production in an era of unstable global trade.

While this “reset” presents challenges for emerging technologies, nevertheless, expect new investment plays that span the sphere of interest for governments and business alike, such as transport infrastructure clusters.

Ports, for instance, are the next wave of industrial clusters to electrify with their multi-modal transport connections for ships, trains and drayage. The cruise industry, for instance, is already pursuing decarbonization through adoption of shore power. Ports are also the staging ground for the deployment of offshore wind, and, for governments, are key hubs for economic growth, stimulating local employment and attracting private sector investment. As strategic nodes for global trade, their electrification will provide an additional layer of resilience for supply chains while enabling the growth of offshore wind farms or connections to hydrogen hubs. Electrification is readily viable. In the U.S., the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have been leaders in electrification, with the Port of Los Angeles the first in the world to electrify a container ship in 2004.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/aphN_31THb20dJVMFRFcyVsLZgJrYleIaDd6W5jdupc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDgyODgzOTE5LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-16 13:56:40.723816

The Canadian company, which operates under the name New Horizon Aircraft, says the Cavorite X7’s fan-in-wing design bridges the gap between helicopter agility and fixed-wing efficiency.

Fourteen lift fans embedded within the aircraft’s wings enable vertical takeoff and landing before the wing covers slide shut for high-speed cruise flight, a sequence the company describes as a “non-event”.

“Horizon Aircraft has designed unique transforming wings that slide to cover the vertical lift fans, enabling fast and efficient forward flight,” Chief Operating Officer Jason O’Neill told Zag Daily. “These covers articulate in a manner similar to the flaps on a commercial airliner. Multiple layers of safety controls ensure the wing covers open and close in a fully synchronized event.”

This design approach is a direct response to the challenges that have plagued other eVTOL developers, particularly those relying on tilt-rotors or heavy pivoting mechanisms. “The versatility of our eVTOL design, capable of both vertical landings and conventional runway operations, allows the Cavorite X7 to operate with exceptional safety,” O’Neill added.

The company now turns its attention to building a full-scale, piloted demonstrator to further prove the design’s stability in real-world conditions. Certification work is already underway with Cert Centre Canada, which specialises in guiding aircraft through Transport Canada and FAA approval pathways.

Horizon says its hybrid-electric architecture is designed with a clear path to full electrification in future. In its current form, the aircraft can reduce hydrocarbon emissions by up to 30% compared to conventional aircraft performing similar missions.

The aircraft has been specifically developed for regional missions involving passengers, cargo, and emergency services, scenarios where access to aviation or sustainable aviation fuel ensures the aircraft can deliver both the range and speed required. O’Neill said that while Horizon sees a fully electric future ahead, the company is already working closely with battery makers and hydrogen specialists to chart a practical and sustainable transition.

Initial commercial applications are expected to focus on mission-critical operations such as medevac and emergency services—scenarios where time sensitivity trumps infrastructure limitations.

“Following entry into service, we anticipate initial use cases will focus on the most time-sensitive missions, including medevac, emergency services, and critical cargo,” said O’Neill. “As our eVTOL production scales, we expect to see growing demand across regional passenger transport and military applications.”

The Cavorite X7 is targeting speeds of up to 250 mph and a range exceeding 500 miles with reserves, positioning it for the emerging Regional Air Mobility (RAM) market.",https://zagdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cropped-E24-0416_X7Military_Refueling_11_withGround.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 11:56:32.887923

The sustainable aviation fuel industry has been all over the map in recent years, so it’s no surprise to see the field branch into the idea of combining green hydrogen with direct air carbon capture. Both fields have met with pushback as initial promises of a quick takeoff have bumped up against the harsh reality of lethargic offtake. However, the Swiss firm Metafuels is confident that SAF can make green H2 and captured CO2 play nice together.

A Rocky Road For SAF From Biofuels

Metafuels also includes a role for biomass in its SAF production system. That can also trigger some skepticism. Bio-based jet fuel has been kicking around the fringes since the early 2000’s without gaining much traction among offtakers.

New plant feedstocks could help kick the industry into gear. In the meantime, though, some industry leaders have been pulling back. In April, for example, Bloomberg reported that BP has hit the pause button on an SAF project at its refinery in Castellon, Spain, according to an anonymous source.

“The decision to pause the biofuels investment was taken due to weaker-than-expected growth in that market, the person said, asking not to be identified because the information is private,” Bloomberg observed.

A New Hope For SAF From E-Fuels

Leaving the direct plant-to-fuel pathway aside, SAF innovators like Metafuels have been heading off in the direction of e-fuels (electrofuels). Electrofuel systems deploy electricity, preferably from renewable resources, to push hydrogen gas from water, as an input for synthetic hydrocarbon liquid fuels.

Metaplant’s “aerobrew” SAF follows the same general outline. “Green H2 can be generated from water electrolysis driven by renewable electricity while CO2 can be removed from the atmosphere using direct air capture technology (DAC) or captured from other biogenic sources,” Metafuels explains.

“Alternatively, green H2 and carbon oxides can be generated from biomass gasification,” Metafuels adds. Its system is designed to switch between biobased green methanol and e-methanol, or do both at the same time, depending on market conditions.

Without giving away too many details (or any at all), the company also notes that it has validated a new high performing, nano-tech based catalytic system to convert its green methanol to SAF.

“The result is a drop-in fuel that reduces life cycle emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional jet fuel, without requiring aircraft re-engineering or infrastructure changes,” Metafuels notes , emphasizing the all-important element of compatibility with existing jet fuel equipment and infrastructure.

Follow The Money To SAF

Aerobrew has already gained traction among investors and public funders. Metafuels describes itself as “one of Europe’s best-funded SAF startups,” with a total of $22 million in funding over the past two years including a $5 million grant from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy.

Last year the company announced plans to launch its “Pizol” production facility in Denmark, and earlier today it announced plans for a second facility, named Turbe, to be located at the Port of Rotterdam.

The Rotterdam plant will launch at 12,000 liters of e-SAF daily, then step up to full volume at 120,000 liters (about 31,700 US gallons) with the support of the energy and chemicals storage firm Evos.

SAF Is Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

In today’s announcement, Metafuels advises that an FID (Final Investment Decision) on the Turbe facility will not happend until halfway through next year, after hitting the FEED (front-end engineering and design) milestone.

However, with the EU targeting the expansion of e-SAF in its decarbonization policy, Metafuels is confident that offtakers will materialize. “Policymakers are relying on a substantial increase in e-SAF capacity over the next decade, with the EU’s synthetic SAF sub-mandate set to begin at 1.2% from 2030 rising to 35% from 2050,” the company explains.

Metafuels is already looking ahead to additional opportunities for its all-in-one, scalable integrated e-SAF facilities, and they are not the only innovator seeking to push fossil energy out of the aviation fuels market. The Port of Rotterdam also aims to host another major SAF facility under a partnership between the Dutch liquid fuels storage firm Advario and Power2X, another Dutch startup.

Power2X includes hydrogen produced from conventional fossil resources under its business umbrella, but the company is also zeroing in on the electrofuels market and that’s where the Port of Rotterdam expects it to land.

“The Power2X production facility will have the capacity to produce over 250,000 tonnes/year of e-SAF, a non-fossil, synthetic fuel made from green hydrogen,” the Port announced last October.

“It will be the largest e-SAF facility announced to-date, making sufficient ultra-low carbon fuel to fully power approximately 7,000 flights between Amsterdam and New York annually,” they added.

Instead of producing green methanol on site, the Power2X facility will import green methanol produced from green hydrogen. “Green methanol will be imported from locations where renewable energy and green hydrogen are abundant,” the Port emphasized.

On the carbon side, apparently Power2X will deploy biogenic resources, rather than direct air capture. As of earlier this year the project was still moving forward with the award of an engineering services contract.

Meanwhile, Here In The USA…

The news just keeps getting worse, worser, and worserer here in the US, as President Donald J. Trump rampages through the government, destroying invaluable public assets with the gleeful assistance of Tesla CEO Elon Musk while throwing one monkey wrench after another into the renewable energy transition.

Still, within the muck of Trump’s fossil-friendly “American Energy Dominance” policy is a carve-out for biomass, and individual US states are continuing to push the SAF envelope with supportive policies.

In March, for example, the leading e-fuels firm HIF Global announced that the California Air Resource Board has awarded approval on its e-fuels pathway under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, the first such approval in the US.

“This LCFS certification underscores the growing demand for e-Fuels in the U.S. and globally, which could reach more than 250 mtpa by 20351, providing opportunity for over $1 trillion in potential capital investment in new facilities to produce the fuels,” stated HIF Global Board Executive Director Meg Gentle. In addition to e-SAF, the certification covers e-naptha and e-diesel.

HIF was one of the first e-fuels firms to surface on the CleanTechnica radar back in 2022, when it announced plans to produce e-fuels in Texas. The facility is still on track as of March.

If it falls through, no biggie. The US is not the only game in town. HIF already has an e-fuels facility up and running in Chile, and it also has commercial scale plans in the works for Uruguay and Australia in addition to the US.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-esaf-metafuels-rotterdam.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 11:56:40.424820

Montana Renewables and Calumet Montana Refining are taxed separately, but together are the county’s largest taxpayers.
FARM TO FUEL Montana Renewables aims to leverage area ag producers to supply products it can turn into sustainable aviation fuels and renewable diesel.","Black Eagle is an industry town. The community sprang up to support the nearby copper smelter, operated for the longest time by the Anaconda Copper Mining Company. Banners along the main drag still depict the massive smokestack that defined the industrial skyline for decades until its demolition in 1981.

The copper smelter is long gone, shuttered just before the stack fell. Fewer than 1,000 people live in the community today. But residents of Black Eagle, which is not part of Great Falls but is adjacent to its northeast corner, still have industry neighbors in the Calumet oil refinery.

Living downwind of the refinery makes the distinct scent of the operation a regular part of life.

“In the summer, you don’t leave your windows open, because you never know,” said Jim Helgeson, a former Great Falls Transit general manager who has lived in Black Eagle for 50 years.

Helgeson is no stranger to this industrial corridor. His parents immigrated from Norway to Great Falls and worked for the Anaconda Company, the predominant industrial operation to the east of Black Eagle. That shuttered in 1980 under the ownership of Atlantic Richfield Company.

These days, it’s the Calumet oil refinery to the west that is undergoing change.

“It’s definitely growing in square footage down there over the last few years,” Helgeson said. “With that, we kind of expected that the smell was going to increase.”

That growth is accelerating at the refinery. Calumet formed a subsidiary, Montana Renewables, which has taken over a substantial portion of the refinery for a biofuels plant and already produces about 10,000 barrels daily. In the coming years, the company will more than double that production, funded by a $1.6 billion loan guarantee from the federal government.

The loan came from a program of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which funneled billions of dollars to projects that could help achieve climate goals. The biofuels operation in Great Falls can take agricultural products like canola oil, rendered cow fat (beef tallow) and camelina oil and process them into products called renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

The Biden administration was especially bullish on sustainable aviation fuel, saying it would significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions in the airline industry. The administration launched a “grand challenge” to incentivize its production and reach a goal of a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

But climate benefits down the supply chain could come at the expense of increased air emissions at the Great Falls site. Although Montana Renewables touts its environmental benefits, projections from the company suggest that the biofuels plant could emit more air pollutants than the site emitted as a crude oil refinery.

Despite these projections, Montana Renewables is seeking to make the plant fully exempt from property taxes by qualifying the entire facility as “pollution control equipment.”

“This is a major industrial facility that is expected, by its own estimates, to emit significant amounts of air pollutants that will impact the health of the surrounding communities,” said Jim Duffy, a Great Falls resident and former official at the California Air Resources Board, a primary industry regulator in that state.

The fuels produced at Montana Renewables have the potential to reduce emissions relative to petroleum-based alternatives when burned in a diesel truck or airplane. But the full environmental impact of the entire biofuels lifecycle, from seeds in the ground to airplane exhaust, isn’t yet fully known for this small but growing industry.

At the production stage here in Great Falls, however, that growth could mean the emission of more harmful pollutants just upwind of Black Eagle.

GROWTH INDUSTRY

Calumet has consistently scaled up operations at the Great Falls refinery. The Indiana company purchased the facility in 2012 from the Montana Refining Company and quickly expanded its output of products made from Canadian crude oil.

By 2016, production grew from about 10,000 barrels of fuel and asphalt per day to a capacity of 25,000 through a $400 million project. Hundreds of workers imported for that project had to arrive by bus because there was so little parking around the facility. Great Falls grew closely around the 100-year-old refinery, which is sandwiched between the Missouri River and the busy, eponymous Smelter Avenue. There’s a Walmart and a restaurant across the street and a middle school just up the road.

That growth in 2016 is dwarfed in cost by the multi-year expansion currently underway to convert the refinery into a leading biofuels production plant. Montana Renewables formed in 2021 and began producing fuel from agricultural-based materials, like canola oil and soybean oil. The creation of the subsidiary formed two different operations at the plant: Calumet, remaining in the petroleum refining business, and Montana Renewables, the growing biofuels producer.

Montana Renewables has said its work will “significantly advance national efforts to address climate change” and reduce transportation emissions. In addition to the ability to transition away from crude oil as raw materials, the fuels are beneficial because they are “drop-in,” meaning they can be used in current airplane and diesel engines. Importantly, sustainable aviation fuel still needs to be blended with conventional jet fuel for use.

“You’ve got to think about the integration of the energy industry at large, in that you need a consumer who has a large demand for the fuel that you’re going to produce,” John Coates, director of the Energy and Biosciences Institute at the University of California Berkeley, told Montana Free Press. “The easiest way to do that is to have a drop-in fuel.”

Calumet secured private financing to get Montana Renewables up and running, according to regulatory filings. In 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to Montana Renewables, which will fund the next phase of the expansion. That will bring the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from about 10,000 barrels per day to a target of 21,500 barrels per day, or 330 million gallons per year. It’s expected to be completed by late 2027.

The company hopes to leverage regional ag producers to supply the plant-based raw materials for biofuel production. In written statements and comments to MTFP, the company said that it will provide a steady market for crop producers. So far, Montana Renewables is importing most of those raw materials from out of state.

“Our success is tied to Montana agriculture producers, and we are looking forward to creating new markets for crops here in Montana, supporting economic growth in our local ag sector,” a company spokesperson for Montana Renewables told MTFP in a statement.

That story of biofuel production for the benefit of ag producers drew bipartisan political support from Republicans like U.S. Sen. Steve Daines and Gov. Greg Gianforte, and Democrats like former U.S. Sen Jon Tester. The project is viewed locally as an economic boost for Great Falls, and the company has promised to add as many as 40 permanent jobs as part of the venture.

But with potential benefits come potential costs, which can be measured both in tax dollars and in tons of pollution.

EMISSIONS AT THE SOURCE

To receive the loan guarantee from the federal government, Montana Renewables was subject to a lengthy environmental assessment. That report included a projection of the maximum air emissions for several pollutants once the full biofuels plant expansion was completed.

The estimates show that the biofuels plant could emit more sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, carbon monoxide and particulate matter than the facility did as a dedicated petroleum refinery.

The emissions from Montana Renewables could outpace those of the Calumet petroleum refinery even while producing less. In 2020, Calumet reported producing 26,742 barrels (daily) of asphalt and fuels made from crude oil. Estimates for target biofuel production at Montana Renewables range from 21,500 to 24,000.

In an interview with MTFP, Calumet/Montana Renewables Senior Vice President Kollin Schade said that the estimated emissions represent a maximum that the plant may not reach during routine operation.

“As we know, the actual emissions are always much lower than the potential to emit,” he said.

Past emissions data show mixed results relative to projections. In 2014, Calumet projected emissions increases that would result from its first expansion of the crude oil refinery. Actual emissions data show that the plant stayed within those projections for many pollutants, but it exceeded those projections by 2016 for pollutants like carbon monoxide and particulate matter. Those exceedances still fell within permitted limits.

When asked if Montana Renewables’ emissions would surpass those of the petroleum refinery even if it did not meet the operational maximum, Schade declined to answer directly.

“All I can say is we’re going to stay at the level of whatever the permitted numbers are that we get from the EPA and the DEQ,” Schade said. “Those are the numbers that are viable to maintain the environmental quality of the air content around the refinery.”

While the pollution estimates are intended to represent the emissions of the plant running at full capacity, they aren’t the same as permitted limits, which can have much higher ceilings than actual emissions. For example, the Montana Renewables and Calumet site is permitted to emit up to 1,515 tons of sulfur dioxide annually, but its estimated actual emissions are a fraction of the permitted limit.

The emissions estimates could force the facility to transition from a “minor” to a “major” emitter under an EPA program known as Prevention of Significant Deterioration. The program is intended to track and permit increases in air pollution from major emitters and has thresholds for certain pollutants that trigger a facility to graduate from minor to major. Montana Renewables indicated in its environmental report that it expected to apply for major status under the program, which requires permitting and additional emissions projections for approval.

Even while Montana Renewables scales up, the Calumet crude oil refinery remains in operation. Though it downsized to make room for its subsidiary, the petroleum side of the plant emitted more carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds in 2023 than it did in the six years before the change, according to emissions reports from the company. And production in 2023 was less than half of the Calumet petroleum refinery’s output at its peak.

Speaking with MTFP, Schade said he believes Montana Renewables is beneficial for the environment and the community.

“From my perspective, it’s a net positive all the way around,” he said. “Employment, agriculture, emissions, the whole bit. I think it’s a win-win-win all the way around.”

BEARING THE TAX BURDEN

In May 2022, the Great Falls City Commission considered a tax break for the Montana Renewables plant. At the time, Calumet had recently settled a multi-year tax protest that reduced the refinery’s property tax bill from $16.9 million to $11 million over three years.

The tax break before the commission was estimated to cost the city nearly $2.8 million in tax revenue over 10 years. Bob Kelly, Great Falls’ mayor at the time, said during the commission meeting that the city must strike a balance between supporting its growing industries and protecting tax proceeds from the city’s largest taxpayer.

“When any entity…decides to do a tax protest and have your valuations redone, that causes great consternation in a revenue source for us, because we are fairly dependent upon a substantial amount of money to flow out of that expansion,” Kelly said.

The premise was that the benefit would last 10 years and incentivize growth and investment in the tax base. After that decade, tax proceeds from the fully expanded plant could flow to the city. The commission unanimously approved the break for Montana Renewables.

Months after that decision, in December 2022, Montana Renewables filed an application to make its entire plant exempt from property taxes in perpetuity. The company asked state regulators to make the biofuel facility, which it valued at $562 million, tax-exempt by qualifying the entire operation as “pollution control equipment.”

The pollution control tax exemption, enshrined in Montana law, applies to “portions” of equipment or machinery that prevent the creation of air or water pollutants. These are often specific devices added to refinery equipment to curb emissions, trap pollutants or otherwise reduce chemicals being emitted. But Montana Renewables has argued that because it uses ag-based raw materials and its products can reduce greenhouse gas emissions when used as fuel, the entire plant should be considered one cohesive pollution control system.

“…The MRL [Montana Renewables] facility is a fully integrated facility, which provides identifiable and substantial environmental benefits that can be achieved only by operation of the biomass conversion plant and all of its equipment together as one emissions-reducing unit,” the company said in an appeal to state regulators.

In 2023, the Montana Department of Environmental Quality denied a full exemption under the pollution control equipment provision but certified more than $25 million worth of equipment for the benefit — a small portion relative to the entire plant’s value.

In documents and memos for the application, DEQ explained that the statute is aimed at specific devices that reduce emissions at industrial facilities that would otherwise pollute more. It wasn’t the intent of the statute to grant tax exemptions to any facility that reduces the use of fossil fuels elsewhere in the supply chain, the state engineers wrote.

“For instance, under this argument, an owner or operator of a wind-generating facility could argue its facility should be designated as pollution control equipment because the facility avoids emissions that might otherwise occur through fossil fuel electricity generation,” a DEQ engineer wrote in a 2023 memo to the company.

Montana Renewables has appealed DEQ’s determination and maintains that the entire plant qualifies for the exemption. The appeal remains pending, and a hearing is set for August before the Montana Tax Appeal Board in Helena.

Duffy, the former California Air Resources Board regulator, called Montana Renewables’ logic absurd. He has submitted several comments to the DEQ to oppose a full exemption. Like the agency’s initial determination, Duffy said the exemption shouldn’t consider potential benefits down the supply chain, such as in airplane emissions.

“The legislation and administrative rules do not include any language to indicate that emissions impacts that occur either upstream or downstream from the facility should be considered,” he told MTFP.

Duffy also rejected the premise that Montana Renewables could be granted a blanket tax exemption as a pollution control system while the company’s own estimates predict a rise in air emissions. He first compared Montana Renewables’ projected emissions with data from the EPA’s National Emissions Inventory.

In an appeal document to the state Tax Appeal Board, Montana Renewables sought to demonstrate its environmental benefits and wrote that the emissions of several pollutants “are all dramatically lower” than those of the petroleum refinery. The comparison represented the biofuels plant at its current state, prior to the billion-dollar expansion.

However, the tax exemption the company seeks would apply to the fully expanded plant. The company didn’t note its own projections, which estimate the opposite of what was written in the appeal document — that emissions on the biofuels side could surpass those of the petroleum refinery.

Schade, the Montana Renewables senior vice president, said that he expects the appeal to conclude in the near future.

While Montana Renewables pursues a tax exemption, it is also applying for or already receiving a menagerie of other tax incentives. The plant currently gets a 50% tax break from both Cascade County and Great Falls under an expanding industry benefit that lasts 10 years.

In December, the plant applied for a 50% property tax break from the state under a benefit for energy production facilities. A bill brought by Great Falls legislator Steve Fitzpatrick in 2023 added producers of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels to the eligible list of beneficiaries, and committee testimony specifically referenced the Montana Renewables project. If approved, that tax break would last 15 years.

Montana Renewables also stands to receive federal clean fuel production tax credits of up to $1.75 per gallon of sustainable aviation fuel delivered.

In its latest annual report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Calumet noted that for Montana Renewables, “a significant component of our product margin consists of a variety of government subsidies, incentives and mandates.”

For the petroleum refinery side of the business, Calumet recently received an 80% tax break on $6.1 million of equipment under a state law that benefits new industrial equipment.

And just a few years after settling its last tax protest, Calumet initiated another multi-year tax protest with the state that could potentially reduce the company’s tax liability. That case remains ongoing. Local governments have had to budget around these protested tax proceeds. On May 6, Great Falls Finance Director Melissa Kinzler told the city commission that the city didn’t receive nearly $1.2 million in protested taxes from the refinery for 2024 and expects an additional $360,000 to be withheld for the current fiscal year.

A full tax exemption for Montana Renewables would create a substantial hole in local government budgets. The company’s tax bill for 2024 was nearly $5.8 million, which includes $1.8 million for Great Falls, $1.1 million for Cascade County and $1.5 million for public schools.

Montana Renewables and Calumet Montana Refining are taxed separately, but together are the county’s largest taxpayers. From 2015 to 2024, the company formally challenged its property valuation to the state in seven of those nine years.

FARM TO FUEL

Montana Renewables aims to leverage area ag producers to supply products it can turn into sustainable aviation fuels and renewable diesel. That has been the company’s cornerstone message.

“When you look at the feedstocks, whether it’s canola oil or camelina, whatever it is, we’re looking to boost our local agricultural involvement with this process overall,” Schade told MTFP. “And we really look at this as a massive benefit for Great Falls, for Montana and really the local community.”

Cyndi Johnson farms canola and other crops east of Conrad. She said there isn’t as much demand these days for what she calls “Montana traditional grains” like high-quality wheat and barley. She recently pivoted to growing more canola and is excited about the prospect of the biofuels plant opening up a new market.

“The only way to survive in this day and age is to diversify,” said Johnson, who is also board chair at the Montana Farm Bureau Federation. “And Montana Renewables is giving us that opportunity for diversity.”

Production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels is a fast-growing industry, and Calumet is not the only oil and gas company making the switch. Phillips 66 converted an entire petroleum refinery in Rodeo, California, to a biofuels plant and now produces 30,000 barrels of renewable diesel daily from ag-based materials.

As these facilities expand, experts are questioning the environmental impacts of diverting cropland for fuel production instead of food. Coates, who directs the Energy and Biosciences Institute at UC Berkeley, said that there’s a real need for transitional fuels to move away from petroleum-based products. But ag-based fuels introduce new factors to consider.

“There’s still the question of land resources, as well as fertilizers and irrigation that all go into this,” he said. “Just because something can be converted to a biofuel doesn’t necessarily mean that it should be, because the environmental footprint of growing that feedstock in the first place might be greater than you might expect.”

Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy also at UC Berkeley, said that a truly sustainable agricultural feedstock wouldn’t compete with crops for human consumption. He pointed to the rise of ethanol production in the late 2000s, which spiked the price of tortillas.

“Very simple statement,” Kammen said. “A biofuel is only as clean as the source if the biomass doesn’t compete with anything. Period, full stop.”

Montana Renewables Plant Manager Ron Colwell addressed that point in 2022 at a Great Falls City Commission meeting, saying that camelina would be a preferred feedstock because it “doesn’t generally compete as a major food product.”

The Montana Renewables plant has adaptable equipment that can make biofuels from beef tallow, distillers’ corn oil, canola oil, used cooking oil and camelina oil. Schade said that this variety allows flexibility for sourcing raw materials and guards against fluctuating prices for any one of those products.

“Just about any seed oil that you can even imagine out there, we will try and bring into the refinery and try to process it,” he said.

A company press release from December indicated that some of those products are coming from farms in Minnesota and the Pacific Northwest. Camelina production is growing in northcentral Montana and got a boost with the opening of Sustainable Oils in Great Falls in 2022. The company specializes in camelina crops for use as biofuel feedstock.

There’s a need for more robust seed crushing plants, which process crops into seed oil, that will open up the market for regional ag producers. Schade said the company is actively looking to support those plants moving into northcentral Montana.

Johnson, who says much of her canola crop is sold to ag product producers like Nutrien and Columbia Grain, disagrees with the idea that her crop would compete for food sources. She said that she and other farmers are following the markets to keep their operations viable.

“I’ve heard some people say that’s going to make less for human consumption,” she said. “That’s not true at all. The people who are growing canola now, who did not grow canola 10 years ago, are growing it because there’s a demand for the oil.”

CLEARED FOR LIFTOFF

While the Trump administration has dismantled some parts of former President Biden’s energy agenda, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge remains in place as a program involving multiple federal agencies, including the Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of Transportation.

An Energy Department spokesperson told MTFP in an email that growing the use of sustainable aviation fuels aligns with Trump’s executive order to “unleash American energy dominance.”

“Both the Trump Administration and this program aim to increase the production of affordable domestically produced fuels, create more export opportunities and fuel choices, support American farmers, and lower energy costs,” the spokesperson wrote.

The government’s plan includes production benchmarks to hit 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050, which would represent 100% adoption by the airline industry. Federal tax credits are part of the incentives offered under the plan, and certain states have their own incentive structures. A prominent example at the state level is California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which Duffy helped to develop.

For Montana Renewables, the enthusiasm from the federal government is a tailwind for the plant’s expansion.

“The DOE, the EPA, they’ve all come out with policies supporting renewable feedstocks [raw materials],” Schade said. “They got into their mathematical equations, and those folks are sharp, and they can see that if you’re looking globally, and you’re trying to reduce certain emissions, the renewable energies are the way to go.”

A federal report on sustainable aviation fuel, which appears to have been removed from government websites, underscored the potential for airline emissions reductions (an archived version of the report is here). It also briefly mentions localized environmental impacts, suggesting that biorefineries “could negatively impact air quality in local communities” through the production and shipping of sustainable aviation fuel.

“Socially vulnerable populations have already felt these impacts due to the similar and more polluting operations of traditional petroleum refineries producing fossil jet fuel,” the report said. “The implementation of emissions control technologies and utilization of low-emission vehicles could reduce these impacts.”

Helgeson, the longtime Black Eagle resident, knows firsthand about dealing with legacy industrial pollution. The Anaconda Company’s smokestack emitted lead, arsenic and metals for decades with little or no environmental regulation. Almost 30 years after the plant closed, EPA studies found lead and arsenic in the yards of Black Eagle residents. Seventeen years after that, work finally started to remove lead-laced soils from those residential yards. That work continues this year.

On the west side of town, the refinery smell persists.

“We’re cleaning it up on one end of town and having it come in from the other,” Helgeson said.",https://montanafreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSCF5547.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 11:56:44.132195

The SAF will then be used for flights that depart from Michigan.
Working collaboratively with our farmers and producers will simultaneously reduce carbon emissions in our atmosphere and support our Michigan economy.
“Sustainable aviation fuel is more than just an environmental solution—it’s a powerful economic opportunity for Michigan’s important agriculture industry,” said Amelia DeLuca, Chief Sustainability Officer at Delta Air Lines.
“I am proud to be part of a commonsense, bipartisan approach to enlisting Michigan farmers in the effort to provide cleaner aviation fuel in our state.","Delta Air Lines on May 7 announced its strong support for new bipartisan, bicameral legislation that will accelerate the growth of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Michigan while strengthening the state’s agricultural economy and creating new opportunities for farmers.

Senate Bills 235-36, introduced by Sens. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing) and Joe Bellino (R-Monroe), and House Bills 4424-25, introduced by Rep. Jerry Neyer, (R-Shepherd), would establish a $1.50 per gallon tax credit for the purchase, production, or blending of SAF starting in 2026. The credit increases to $2 per gallon for fuels that deliver greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The SAF will then be used for flights that depart from Michigan.

“This bipartisan plan will make aviation fuel more accessible and affordable and will help us realize the global vision we spelled out in our landmark Clean Energy Future plan,” Sen. Singh said. “Decarbonizing the aviation sector will not be easy, but we have to start somewhere. Working collaboratively with our farmers and producers will simultaneously reduce carbon emissions in our atmosphere and support our Michigan economy. By tackling this monumental task, we continue to prove that Michigan is a global leader in protecting our environment.”

Rep. Neyer, chair of the House Agriculture Committee, said: “Whether we like it or not, things are changing in Michigan. New clean energy standards are quickly approaching, and pending policy changes from the feds have left corn and soybean farmers with a ‘let’s wait and see’ mentality. And who can blame them? The demand for their products could change with one press conference. This bipartisan plan is a practical solution that will reduce emissions, promote economic growth, and take care of our farmers. By incentivizing the private sector to produce and blend SAF here in Michigan, we can encourage cleaner skies and boost the agriculture industry at the same time.”

By encouraging the use of Michigan-grown feedstocks such as corn and soybeans, the legislation is poised to open new markets for farmers, helping revitalize rural economies and reinforcing the vital connection between agriculture and energy innovation.

“Sustainable aviation fuel is more than just an environmental solution—it’s a powerful economic opportunity for Michigan’s important agriculture industry,” said Amelia DeLuca, Chief Sustainability Officer at Delta Air Lines. “This legislation would help unlock the full potential of homegrown feedstocks to fuel our aircraft and the ag economy. At Delta, we are committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and this legislation gives us the chance to do it in a way that also supports family farms and rural communities across the state.”

The agriculture industry stands to benefit significantly from the emerging SAF market. By using renewable feedstocks from Michigan farms, SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel while also creating stable demand for corn and soybean growers.

“Access to sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy products is critical to long-term economic growth,” Sen. Bellino said. “I am proud to be part of a commonsense, bipartisan approach to enlisting Michigan farmers in the effort to provide cleaner aviation fuel in our state. It is a proactive solution that supports our local farmers, boosts our agriculture industry, and better ensures stable fuel costs — all while also helping cut harmful emissions.”

John Delmotte, President of the Michigan Corn Growers Association and Sen. Bellino’s constituent, said: “This legislation mirrors the successful strategy that made ethanol a staple of American energy—using smart tax credits to create a market-driven solution to benefit farmers, consumers, and our environment.

Meanwhile, both Luton and Stansted airports have been given permission to expand their terminals in order to allow for higher passenger capacity.
But Warrington said there was “no convincing argument at all that expanding airports will lead to economic growth”.
“If you look at the history of airport expansions ... it’s not creating jobs, it’s not increasing exports – it’s just allowing the small group of wealthy frequent flyers to take even more frequent holidays abroad,” she added.
Aviation is widely recognised as a hard-to-abate sector with regards to carbon emissions, along with shipping, construction and steelmaking.","Proposals to expand Gatwick, Heathrow and Luton airports would make it more difficult for the UK to meet its climate obligations while failing to deliver the mooted economic benefits, MPs have said.

In recent months, the government has granted consent for Heathrow to finally build its long-debated third runway, while transport secretary Heidi Alexander has signalled she is inclined to approve a second runway at Gatwick later this year. Meanwhile, both Luton and Stansted airports have been given permission to expand their terminals in order to allow for higher passenger capacity.

Addressing a group of MPs at a meeting of the Environmental Audit Committee, Johann Beckford, senior policy adviser at Green Alliance, called for a “moratorium” on airport expansions due the long-term extra carbon emissions that will be associated with greater air travel.

“By 2050 the Climate Change Committee suggests that around 400 million or so passengers could travel, which is still a very significant increase ... a 20–28% increase on today,” he said. “If you were to take all of the airport expansions currently on the table ... we’re likely to be seeing more in the region of 500 million passengers travelling per year.”

Committee member Chris Hinchliff, the Labour MP for North East Hertfordshire, said the proposed expansions would require the UK to plant a forest “twice the size of Greater London” by 2028 to counter the additional emissions.

“The reality is that airports are going to want to do everything in their power to make full use of the additional capacity having invested in it,” he added.

The UK is estimated to already have the capacity to meet the growing demand for air travel up to 2050, although the expansions could increase the demand if it leads to falling costs and greater access.

“Ways to increase flights from the UK is just the wrong question ... We should be asking, how severe is the environmental harm this is causing, and will it bring any kind of economic benefits that could counterbalance that?” said Alethea Warrington, head of aviation at climate charity Possible.

The government has cited its efforts to tackle the UK’s sluggish GDP growth as the reason behind its decision to approve the expansions.

But Warrington said there was “no convincing argument at all that expanding airports will lead to economic growth”.

“If you look at the history of airport expansions ... it’s not creating jobs, it’s not increasing exports – it’s just allowing the small group of wealthy frequent flyers to take even more frequent holidays abroad,” she added.

The plant

Metafuels' strategic decision to establish its first large-scale SAF plant in Rotterdam highlights a pivotal moment for sustainable aviation fuel production in Europe. The Rotterdam plant, named Turbe, will be integrated into Evos' existing storage terminal, enabling significant methanol storage capacity and robust logistical infrastructure. This plant aims to produce 12,000 liters of SAF per day initially, with a future goal to scale production tenfold. The collaboration between Metafuels and Evos taps into Rotterdam's critical role as a major transshipment port, facilitating access to renewable methanol from diverse sources, including biomethanol and e-methanol.

According to Metafuels CEO Saurabh Kapoor, the plant aligns with Europe's ambitious decarbonization targets by providing scalable SAF production, a crucial component for aviation to meet future environmental mandates. Despite the promising technology, the SAF market still represents a small fraction of global aviation fuel usage, with only 0.53% of fuel use in 2024 accounted for by SAF. The EU's target for 70% SAF usage by 2050 emphasizes the necessity for projects like Turbe to succeed and expand production capabilities.",https://ioplus.nl/api/media/file/plane-2605014_1280-3.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 10:56:18.418836

Capacity is scaling up, prices are dropping, and production is accelerating well ahead of regulatory deadlines. The real story is not one of failure, but of extraordinary industrial transformation poised to lead Europe’s transport decarbonisation journey.

Europe’s refiners are not just meeting regulatory expectations—they are outperforming them. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production is already on track to exceed the EU’s ReFuelEU targets. Current production capacity of 1.5 million tonnes of HEFA-based SAF, alongside firm investments that will bring an additional 2.4 million tonnes online by 2029, positions the sector to comfortably surpass both the 2025 and 2030 mandates. By 2025, the industry will have already delivered the required 1 million tonnes, and by 2030, it will have more than the necessary 2.7 million tonnes available. This achievement is not speculation—it is backed by data from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and industry tracking from Argus Media, both confirming that Europe’s SAF capacity is set to outpace demand until at least 2035.

Despite this progress, recent public narratives have misrepresented the sector’s performance. Claims derived from an early version of a Boston Consulting Group report wrongly suggest fuel producers are falling short. However, BCG itself has clarified that global bio-SAF production is forecasted to reach up to 12 million tonnes by 2030, well beyond the EU’s 3 million-tonne requirement under ReFuelEU. These misleading accusations not only ignore the hard data but also undermine the critical role European refiners are playing in supporting the continent’s climate goals.

Investments in SAF have come at great risk to Europe’s fuel manufacturers, who have pressed forward despite unstable regulation and uncertain returns. Billions of euros have already been channelled into biorefineries, with seven plants currently delivering 100% renewable fuels for multiple transport sectors. SAF production alone has increased tenfold in just two years, from 100,000 tonnes in 2022 to over 1 million tonnes by 2024. Equally impressive is the dramatic fall in renewable fuel prices, which have dropped by more than 40% relative to conventional jet fuel between 2021 and 2023. This price progress reflects the industry’s commitment to scaling production efficiently, without waiting for perfect policy conditions.

Yet policy remains the largest barrier to unlocking SAF’s full potential. Without coherent, predictable regulatory frameworks, the momentum achieved risks stalling. The industry is calling for urgent action to enable faster growth: recognising innovative production methods, broadening the range of eligible feedstocks, aligning regulatory criteria across EU systems, and providing clear, long-term mandates beyond 2030. Enabling national-level incentives to accelerate production before regulatory deadlines and supporting capital-heavy e-SAF projects through the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan are essential next steps.

Europe’s refiners have already proven they are not obstacles, they are the driving force behind the green transformation of aviation. Their pioneering investments, technological advancements, and growing production capacity demonstrate their strategic value as partners in achieving climate neutrality. The focus now must shift to enabling policies that match this industrial ambition.",https://www.directorstalkinterviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Avation-plc.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 10:56:24.663293

LONDON, UK – The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), in collaboration with global consultancy ICF, has launched a bold new framework urging the entire Travel & Tourism sector to unite in tackling one of its toughest challenges: scaling up the production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels.

The report, Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel, sets out a practical roadmap for how every business in the sector, no matter its size or role, can help address transport-related emissions and accelerate the shift to cleaner fuels.

Julia Simpson, WTTC President & CEO, said “Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand. If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and stalled climate progress.

“Every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play. This framework gives them the blueprint. Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity; it’s a business imperative and governments must incentivise the production of SAF, not just set targets for the sector.”

Today, SAF accounts for just 0.3% of global jet fuel use. To meet net-zero targets by 2050, production must increase more than 400-fold – from 1.25BN litres today to over 450BN litres. That will require as many as 6,500 new renewable fuel plants worldwide. Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF) faces similar supply and infrastructure constraints.

Unlike other decarbonisation options, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ solution. It works with existing engines and aircraft. But high production costs, limited infrastructure, and feedstock competition have kept volumes low and prices high – up to 10 times that of conventional fuel.

The new WTTC-ICF framework offers clear, tiered actions for Travel & Tourism stakeholders to engage, whether as Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, or Investors. From joining campaigns and supplying waste products, to funding production facilities or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates, the report makes it clear: every business can contribute.

Daniel Galpin, ICF Managing Director, stated “Decarbonising transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector. While transport industries, particularly aviation with its focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), have recognised the importance of sustainable fuels and are couragesouly working towards a new era, there remains a significant journey ahead. It is essential for the broader tourism ecosystem to take action and provide support to meet the targets set, as well as to implement both operational and strategic changes required.

“ICF is proud to have collaborated closely with WTTC to identify the roles that tourism stakeholders can adopt and the actions they can take to facilitate the decarbonisation of the sector, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future.”

Real-world case studies show how action is already underway. The Erawan Group is turning hotel waste oil into SAF, in Asia, whilst Jet2 has invested in a UK-based SAF plant using recyclable household waste.

Crucially, the report warns that unless the sector acts collectively, SAF mandates introduced by governments, requiring a 5% to 10% blend by 2030, could increase travel costs and limit consumer choice.

Swiss aviation technology company Metafuels AG is to open a new synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) production plant in the Port of Rotterdam, marking another key milestone in the commercial deployment of its proprietary aerobrew methanol-to-jet technology.

Metafuels is collaborating with Evos to integrate the plant into their Rotterdam site. Evos is a leading liquid energy and chemicals storage company in Europe committed to supporting innovative energy solutions.

This project builds on Metafuels’ expanding European footprint, following the 2024 announcement of Pizol – its planned production facility in Denmark. The Rotterdam plant, named Turbe, will initially produce 12,000 litres of e-SAF per day, with plans for a second phase to increase production tenfold to 120,000 litres per day.

Metafuels’ rapid growth is fuelled by strong investment support. In just over two years, the company has raised $22 million, including a $5 million grant from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, making it one of Europe’s best-funded SAF startups.

The Evos Rotterdam terminal is a dedicated multimodal methanol hub and the largest ethanol storage provider in Europe. It offers full connectivity across vessel, barge, truck, and rail, with facilities to store renewable methanol that meets International Methanol Producers and Consumers Association (IMPCA) specifications.

As a promising alternative to fossil fuels, renewable methanol plays a critical role in sectors where decarbonisation is challenging, serving as a clean bunker fuel in marine transport and as an intermediate product in sustainable aviation fuel production, particularly within innovative e-SAF pathways.

Affordable, scalable production of e-SAF

Metafuels’ aerobrew technology converts sustainably produced methanol into jet fuel with high energetic efficiency and ultra-high carbon conversion. The result is a drop-in fuel that reduces life cycle emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional jet fuel, without requiring aircraft re-engineering or infrastructure changes.

The justification for such technology is clear. The aviation sector accounts for over 2% of global CO2 emissions—some 800 million tonnes. When accounting for additional greenhouse gases and complex climate co-factors resulting from the nature and altitude of emissions, the sector’s total contribution to global warming rises to approximately 3.5%.

aerobrew SAF plants can process bio-methanol or e-methanol interchangeably, allowing the production of bio-SAF or e-SAF, or both simultaneously, in response to market signals.

Bio-methanol can be produced, for example, from biological waste, while e-SAF uses renewable electricity and captured carbon to create synthetic fuels, offering a truly scalable and future-proof solution for aviation decarbonisation.

Scaling SAF production in line with global and EU mandates

The development of the Turbe plant is progressing steadily, with key milestones already achieved. The next phase for Metafuels will be the launch of front-end engineering and design (FEED), followed by a Final Investment Decision (FID) in mid-2026.

The project aligns with major European sustainability initiatives, including RefuelEU Aviation, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), and other legislation aimed at advancing the aviation industry's transition to net-zero emissions.

Europe is expected to lead the adoption of synthetic or e-fuels, driven by strong regulatory support. Policymakers are relying on a substantial increase in e-SAF capacity over the next decade, with the EU’s synthetic SAF sub-mandate set to begin at 1.2% from 2030 rising to 35% from 2050.

Saurabh Kapoor, CEO of Metafuels, commented: “We have made excellent progress with our technology, and this first-of-a-kind commercial plant represents a major step forward in its commercial deployment. We are very excited about our cooperation with Evos as we work towards delivering the Turbe project. Europe has ambitious decarbonisation targets, but without scalable and affordable SAF production, aviation will struggle to keep up.”

New laws announced aim to increase homegrown sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), ensuring UK revenue certainty for green fuel producers, and awarding an additional £400,000 of funding for producers so that new clean fuels can get to market quicker.

SAF is an alternative to fossil jet fuel, but is more costly to produce than jet fuel.

A revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) for green fuel producers seeks to keep ticket price changes minimal.

It will be industry funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers. The Department for Transport will engage with industry on the details of the RCM, including pricing.

The new round of funding for testing and validating new fuels follows £63mln of funding made available through the Advanced Fuels Fund this year.

The legislation is said to be designed to help industry meet its requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year, which specifies that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030, be made with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel in the industry

In most areas in the aviation industry, there is a huge push towards net-zero and green commitments. Still, currently, according to a WTTC report, SAF accounts for just 0.3% of global jet fuel, or 1.25 billion litres. For context, the industry would need to be using 450 billion litres to meet airline net-zero goals.

It is of course a work in progress and nations are implementing measures to increase the use of SAF, by rolling out initiatives requiring airlines to use SAF in their fuel mix. Notably, EU airlines currently sit at a 2% SAF blend in 2025, escalating to 70% by 2050. China however requires airlines to be using a 15% SAF blend by the year 2030. Similar policies exist in nations like Sweden, Brazil, and Japan, whilst India and Turkey are currently exploring mandates.

How could the current status of SAF impact air travel?

The simple fact is, SAF production can cost up to 10 times more than conventional jet fuel. A lack of investment and infrastructure has not helped to mitigate this, WTTC president and CEO Julia Simpson says:

“Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game changer for travel and tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand. Every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play. Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity. It’s a business imperative. Governments must incentivise SAF production, not just set targets.”

There has been undeniable growth in SAF production and integration into the aviation industry in the last decade, but if the industry does not come together as a whole, meeting the government mandates to increase the SAF blend in fuel could increase the cost of air travel for consumers and limit their options.

By signing individual MOUs with airlines on four continents, Kuehne+Nagel is expanding its geographical reach for sustainability collaboration. The collaboration will focus on several key areas to achieve its sustainability goals:

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use and decarbonisation: Sourcing and promoting the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) as well as other optimisation measures to reduce the carbon footprint. SAF, which is derived from renewable resources, can reduce lifecycle CO2 emissions by an average of 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Transparency and impact tracking: Regular exchanges of data and information between Kuehne+Nagel and each airline to improve the understanding and quality of emissions, track the progress of reductions, and track the impact of the carrier engagement programme overall beyond carbon emissions.

Holistic sustainability approach: Expanding efforts to address broader sustainability challenges.

Fabiano Piccinno, Air Logistics Global Head of Sustainability at Kuehne+Nagel, comments: “As an asset-light company, it is crucial for us to collaborate with our carriers to reach our ambitious science-based targets while also sending a clear signal. The signing of these MoUs represents a milestone for the industry and marks our joint commitment to supporting a sustainable future. We are very excited about the new initiatives that will emerge out of this, ultimately, benefiting our customers.”

The current individually signed MoUs are with carriers that cover approximately 50% of Kuehne+Nagel’s emissions from air freight (based on emissions for full year 2024).

The world's appetite for biofuels is growing fast as energy market participants move to meet net zero obligations and commitments, and to diversify sources of supply. The biofuels complex includes commodities ranging from sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and biodiesel to feedstocks such as used cooking oil (UCO) and tallow.

These products are shipped in specialised chemical tankers, which operate in a sophisticated and opaque multi-commodity market.

The lack of reliable freight pricing information has made it hard to conduct detailed analysis and make informed trading decisions for market participants across the supply chain — from fuel suppliers and midstream companies to traders and financial institutions.

The Argus Specialised Freight service provides over 180 freight prices for biofuels and their feedstocks, as well as for chemicals such as methanol, glycols and aromatics, with other specialised market prices to follow in the coming months. The service covers full and part-cargo loads for all key vessel types — IMO2, IMO3 and stainless steel tankers.

""The new Argus Specialised Freight service brings much-needed transparency to previously opaque freight costs in biofuels and chemicals industries. It will help a lot of businesses active in this space to manage risk in an increasingly complex and highly regulated market,"" Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks said.

Argus is the leading worldwide provider of renewable fuel indexes and benchmarks for renewable diesel, SAF and the key feedstock UCO. Its price assessments are used as the settlement basis for futures contracts in these products in the US, Europe and Asia.

The Rotterdam plant, named Turbe, will initially produce 12,000 litres of e-SAF per day, with plans for a second phase to increase production tenfold to 120,000 litres per day.

The Evos Rotterdam terminal is a dedicated multimodal methanol hub and the largest ethanol storage provider in Europe.

It offers full connectivity across vessel, barge, truck, and rail, with facilities to store renewable methanol that meets International Methanol Producers and Consumers Association (IMPCA) specifications.

As a promising alternative to fossil fuels, renewable methanol plays a critical role in sectors where decarbonisation is challenging, serving as a clean bunker fuel in marine transport and as an intermediate product in sustainable aviation fuel production, particularly within innovative e-SAF pathways.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Metafuels-and-Evos-pic-Bioful-16-5-100768223-768x247.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 07:56:56.209393

Metafuels’ CEO Saurabh Kapoor told TNW that Turbe represents a “major step forward” toward ramping up SAF production. The startup also announced plans to build a similar facility in Denmark last year.

“Europe has ambitious decarbonisation targets, but without scalable and affordable SAF production, aviation will struggle to keep up,” said Kapoor.

The facility, dubbed Turbe, will be built in collaboration with liquid energy storage provider Evos. Turbe will be integrated into Evos’ existing Rotterdam terminal, which offers access to the infrastructure needed to store green methanol in large quantities.

Metafuels’ “aerobrew” technology converts renewable methanol into jet fuel, using a process it claims delivers high energy efficiency and up to 90% lower life cycle emissions than conventional jet fuel. The resulting SAF is “drop-in ready,” requiring no changes to aircraft or airport infrastructure.

Turbe will be able to process both bio-methanol — sourced from biological waste — and e-methanol, which is made using renewable electricity and captured CO2. This flexibility allows Metafuels to respond to shifts in feedstock availability and regulatory demand, the company said.

Kapoor said he expects both the Netherlands and Denmark plants to start producing fuel for use in commercial aircraft from 2028. However, before that happens, the company will need to obtain accreditation for its aerobrew process, which it expects to get by the end of this year.

Metafuels says the new site will produce 12,000 litres of SAF per day during its first phase, with ambitions to scale that tenfold in the second phase. For reference, a Boeing 737 Max has a fuel tank capacity of around 26,000 litres, which equates to a range of around 6,570 km.

Metafuels and the broader aviation industry still has a long way to go to meet global and regional targets for SAF adoption.

The global tourism industry, long reliant on carbon-intensive air travel, is facing a defining moment. With emissions from aviation standing as a significant barrier to climate goals, the recent partnership between the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) and ICF signals a critical shift. Their newly unveiled framework offers a fresh approach—one that transforms every tourism stakeholder into a climate catalyst through the widespread scaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

More than just a response to regulatory pressure, this framework positions sustainable fuels as a shared industry mission, one that reshapes roles and responsibilities across the travel ecosystem.

Why Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matters Now

Aviation, responsible for a growing slice of global emissions, is notoriously hard to decarbonize. SAF emerges as a standout solution because of its “drop-in” compatibility with existing aircraft infrastructure. Yet despite its potential, SAF currently accounts for a mere 0.3 percent of global aviation fuel. To meet the goal of net-zero by 2050, that volume needs to increase over 400-fold.

This immense scaling requirement equates to more than 450 billion litres of SAF per year—a challenge requiring not only technological innovation but also political will, industry alignment, and economic cooperation. The framework introduced by WTTC and ICF provides exactly that kind of structured, industry-wide roadmap.

Redefining Roles in Travel Sustainability

Perhaps the most compelling feature of the new strategy is its democratization of action. The framework categorises tourism businesses into four engagement types: Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, and Investors. Each category outlines distinct pathways for involvement—from providing feedstock to committing to long-term SAF purchases or investing in production.

This inclusive design means sustainability is no longer the sole domain of airlines or regulators. Hotels, tour operators, and even travel booking platforms are invited to become active participants. Such a shift reframes sustainability from a technical problem to a shared business strategy.

Turning Waste into Fuel: Circularity in Action

The transition to SAF is not limited to science labs or refineries. Across Asia, for example, hospitality brands are converting used cooking oil into SAF feedstock, effectively closing a circular economy loop. Meanwhile, in Europe, airlines are financing SAF plants powered by recyclable household waste, tackling both energy and waste challenges at once.

These examples reinforce that sustainable fuel is not just a cleaner option; it is a smarter business decision that intersects with waste management, energy security, and supply chain resilience.

Economic Opportunity or Cost Spiral?

Without intervention, the SAF demand-supply mismatch could lead to spiralling costs, reduced travel accessibility, and compliance headaches. The WTTC-ICF report warns that upcoming SAF blending mandates, such as those requiring five to ten percent SAF by 2030, could strain operators unprepared for price volatility or fuel scarcity.

However, with coordinated scaling, the industry can preempt this crisis. Building SAF capacity now can stabilise long-term fuel prices and ensure compliance without sacrificing customer affordability or market reach.

Tourism as a Driver of Economic Resilience

The stakes extend far beyond emissions. By 2035, tourism is projected to contribute $16.5 trillion to the global economy and support over 460 million jobs. If the industry falters in its transition to sustainable fuels, the economic fallout could be vast.

Investing in SAF is not just an environmental imperative—it is an economic safeguard. It protects livelihoods, ensures continued access to global markets, and strengthens tourism’s license to operate in a carbon-conscious world.

From Pledges to Pathways

This framework distinguishes itself by moving past abstract pledges. It outlines infrastructure needs, financing mechanisms, and policy incentives that can unlock sustainable fuel investments. It also calls on governments to go beyond target-setting by enabling production, streamlining regulations, and fostering innovation.

For businesses, this is a strategic signal. Participation in SAF development is not merely reputational—it’s operational. The shift toward sustainable fuels will increasingly influence procurement decisions, investor expectations, and brand credibility.

A New Narrative for Tourism

Too often, travel sustainability narratives hinge on sacrifice—fewer flights, more offsets, higher prices. This strategy offers a new story: one where growth, access, and emissions reductions coexist. It shows that climate resilience can be designed into tourism, not bolted on as an afterthought.

The tourism sector, once viewed as an emissions challenge, can now position itself as an innovation engine, driving global progress on clean energy.

Conclusion

The WTTC and ICF framework marks a turning point. It shifts the conversation from isolated commitments to industry-wide momentum. With Sustainable Aviation Fuel as a core focus, the tourism industry now has the tools, the mandate, and the momentum to scale climate action like never before.

By acting together—across business size, sector, and geography—the travel industry can convert ambition into infrastructure, and intention into impact. Sustainable fuels are no longer a distant ideal; they are a defining feature of tourism’s future.

Now is the time to move from awareness to agency. The journey toward climate-resilient tourism does not begin at a destination—it begins with fuel in the tank.",https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/images/email/artdeco/logos/96/linkedin-bug-color.png,N,,2025-05-16 09:56:09.782641

Businesses can get involved by supporting advocacy campaigns, providing feedstock like used cooking oil, funding fuel production, or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates.
“Decarbonising transport is essential to a sustainable tourism sector, and it requires the full ecosystem to engage,” said Daniel Galpin, Managing Director at ICF.","The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) is calling for urgent, unified action across the global tourism industry to scale up production and adoption of sustainable fuels – warning that failure to act could lead to soaring travel costs and stunted climate progress.

In a joint report with global consultancy ICF titled “Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel”, WTTC sets out a practical roadmap to accelerate the uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels. The framework outlines how all players – from airlines and cruise lines to hotels and travel agencies – can contribute to decarbonizing transport and supporting the sector’s green transition.

“Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but supply is dangerously behind demand,” said WTTC President & CEO Julia Simpson. “If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and missed climate targets. Governments must incentivise SAF production – not just set mandates.”

Currently, SAF represents just 0.3 percent of global jet fuel use. To align with net-zero goals by 2050, production must increase more than 400-fold – from 1.25 billion liters to over 450 billion liters annually. This will require up to 6,500 new renewable fuel plants worldwide. Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF) faces similarly steep challenges in terms of cost and infrastructure.

What sets SAF apart is its compatibility: it’s a “drop-in” fuel that works with existing aircraft engines. But high costs – up to 10 times more than conventional jet fuel – and limited feedstock availability continue to hinder scale.

The WTTC-ICF framework introduces four levels of engagement for industry stakeholders: Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, and Investors. Businesses can get involved by supporting advocacy campaigns, providing feedstock like used cooking oil, funding fuel production, or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates.

“Decarbonising transport is essential to a sustainable tourism sector, and it requires the full ecosystem to engage,” said Daniel Galpin, Managing Director at ICF. “This report identifies concrete actions businesses can take to help build a cleaner, more resilient future.”

Real-world initiatives are already showing progress. In Asia, The Erawan Group is converting hotel waste oil into SAF. In the UK, Jet2 has invested in a SAF plant that uses recyclable household waste.

The report also cautions that government mandates requiring 5–10 percent SAF blends by 2030 – without adequate supply – could drive up travel prices and limit consumer choice.

With the Travel & Tourism sector projected to contribute $16.5 trillion to the global economy and support over 460 million jobs by 2035, WTTC argues that scaling sustainable fuel is not just an environmental issue – it’s an “economic imperative”.

Part 21.In ""Bjorn's Corner"" Bjorn’s Corner: Air Transport’s route to 2050.","May 16, 2025, ©. Leeham News: We do a Corner series about the state of developments to improve the emission situation for Air Transport. We try to understand why development has been slow.

We have since we started in October last year looked at:

Alternative, lower emission propulsion technologies, ranging from electric aircraft with batteries as energy source, different propulsion hybrids, and new concepts for jet-fuel and Hydrogen gas turbine engines.

We have also reviewed recent research on the role of CO2, NOx emissions, and Contrails generated by airliners.

Two weeks ago, we summarized the present situation around SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

We examined Alternative 1’s emissions improvement last week and now compare it to the normal improvement in fuel consumption, and thus emissions, that the airline industry is continuously working on.

Improvement in emissions from new generation airliners

We presently have around 25,000 airliners that fly up to seven missions every day of the year. These then consume around 300 million tonnes of jet fuel, generating 950 million tonnes of CO2.

What is the effect of these emissions from the continuous replacement of the oldest of the 25,000 airliners with newer, more efficient ones?

We examine this by the replacement of more efficient new aircraft each year. To get some feel for the segments affected by this replacement, we divide the analysis into Regional, Single-Aisle, and Widebody airliners.

The present generation of more efficient jets is about 20% more efficient than the previous generation they replace. This 20% replacement improvement also includes a small number of two-generation-old airliners.

For the different airliner segments, we can deduce the following replacement pace between 2025 and 2050:

Regionals: About 200 new regional jets and turboprops were delivered last year. If we assume that the deliveries increase by 3% per year, the regional segment will have 420 deliveries per year by 2050. We assume the new deliveries save 20% of fuel compared with the old ones these replace up to 2040, then 30% as a further improved generation starts delivery. In total, 4,000 regional airliners will be replaced by 2040 and another 3,700 after 2040. In total, these save 13.4 million tonnes in yearly fuel consumption by 2050, which equals 42 million tonnes of CO2.

Single Aisle: About 900 new single aisle jets were delivered last year. If we assume that the deliveries increase by 5% per year, the Single Aisle segment will have 3,000 deliveries per year by 2050. We assume the new deliveries save 20% of fuel up to 2040, then 30% from 2040 to 2050 as a further improved generation replaces the present aircraft. In total, 21,300 single aisles are replaced by 2040 and another 24,700 after 2040 (these numbers then include growth of the segment). These then save 135 million tonnes in yearly fuel consumption by 2050, which equals 427 million tonnes of CO2.

Widebody: About 230 new Widebody jets were delivered last year. If we assume that the deliveries increase by 3% per year, the Widebody segment will have 480 deliveries per year by 2050. We assume the new deliveries save 20% of fuel compared with the old ones, replacing them up to 2040, then 30% from 2040. In total, 4,600 Widebodies will be replaced by 2040, and another 4,200 after 2040. In total, we have 8,800 Widebodies replaced. These then save 40 million tonnes in yearly fuel consumption by 2050, which equals 126 million tonnes of CO2.

In total, we save 188 million tonnes of fuel and 595 million tonnes of CO2 during the year 2050. This is, of course, not 188 million tonnes of the present 300 million tonnes of yearly Jet-A1 consumption during 2050.

Some of the delivered aircraft will contribute to growth of the total fleet, so the saving in percent of yearly consumption is not 188 divided by 300.

However, nearly all present older-generation aircraft will have been replaced by 2040, when 30,000 new aircraft will have been added, and the other 32,000 between 2040 and 2050.

Scottish Secretary Ian Murray celebrated the milestone, describing it as a significant step in pursuing sustainable energy solutions.

The company will be headquartered in Aberdeen, Scotland’s energy capital, and will also operate satellite offices in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Juergen Maier, GB Energy's inaugural chair, previously underscored the firm's economic potential, forecasting the creation of hundreds of jobs right from the start. Eventually, Aberdeen alone could see over a thousand new jobs as GB Energy reaches full operational capacity.

“Headquartered in Aberdeen, Great British Energy will help unlock tremendous opportunities for Scotland, particularly in harnessing our abundant renewable energy resources,” Murray said.

“Scotland is at the heart of our plans to become a clean energy superpower and today is a crucial step forward in boosting investment in green technologies and infrastructure, helping to create thousands of high-quality jobs across Scotland, drive economic growth, helping to lower bills for consumers and ensure energy security for generations to come.”

Interestingly, GB Energy won’t be directly supplying homes with electricity. Instead, the focus will be on boosting renewable technologies and backing transformative green energy initiatives nationwide.

For instance, the state-owned entity has already committed £200 million in funding for rooftop solar and renewable energy schemes benefiting schools, hospitals, and local communities. This targeted support will substantially cut energy bills for vital public institutions, directly linking the UK's renewable ambitions to tangible community-level savings.

GB Energy's efforts don’t stop there: a contribution of £4 million has already been made to Scotland’s Community Energy Generation Growth Fund. With the fund's recent reopening—now totalling £8 million—communities across Scotland are invited to bid for crucial funding, helping them launch grassroots renewable generation projects.

“Great British Energy comes from a simple idea: British people should own and benefit from our own natural resources,” UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said.

“We are giving people a stake in clean energy and delivering profits for the British people. As part of our Plan for Change, this will make us a clean energy superpower and help bring down energy bills for good.”

Further demonstrating their commitment, GB Energy recently hosted a key roundtable event in Edinburgh, alongside Scottish Secretary Ian Murray.

If the market price dips below this threshold, the Government steps in to cover the shortfall.
A variable levy will be introduced to fund this initiative, targeting aviation fuel suppliers.
As part of the ongoing rollout, the DfT confirmed it will continue consulting with industry players to refine how the RCM operates, particularly around setting the strike price.","The UK Government has unveiled a new support scheme for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers that promises financial certainty without hitting passengers’ wallets too hard. Called the Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RCM), this policy aims to stabilise returns for SAF producers by buffering them against unpredictable market prices, effectively de-risking investment in a technology critical to aviation’s net-zero future.

At the heart of the RCM is a Guaranteed Strike Price model. Here's how it works: producers receive a fixed price per unit of SAF. If the market price dips below this threshold, the Government steps in to cover the shortfall. If it rises above, the producers pay back the surplus. It levels the playing field for emerging green fuel companies competing in a volatile market.

A variable levy will be introduced to fund this initiative, targeting aviation fuel suppliers. While the cost of this levy is expected to trickle down to passengers, the Department for Transport (Dft) has emphasised that the impact on fares will be minimal. On average, the increase to a single passenger's annual airfare will be capped at just £1.50.

But this isn’t just about fares—it’s about future-proofing air travel. Currently, SAF represents a sliver of the total jet fuel mix and remains costly. Yet, it holds enormous promise. With a lifecycle emissions reduction of up to 70%, SAF is a cornerstone of the UK’s strategy to cut aviation-related greenhouse gases.

This policy feeds directly into the UK’s SAF Mandate, which requires:

10% of all jet fuel on UK-departing flights to come from sustainable sources by 2030,

rising to 22% by 2040.

To meet these goals, the country anticipates using 1.2 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2030, contributing to an expected 6.3 million tonnes CO₂e reduction in aviation emissions by 2040.

In support of this push, the Government also announced an additional £400,000 for SAF testing and certification, building on the £63 million already allocated through the Advanced Fuels Fund earlier in the year. Ensuring that SAF meets rigorous standards will be essential as adoption scales.

As part of the ongoing rollout, the DfT confirmed it will continue consulting with industry players to refine how the RCM operates, particularly around setting the strike price. The dialogue aims to strike a balance between investor confidence and taxpayer value.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/11062b_1229cdb86a6e4d2db370f340b9e0632f~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_667,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/11062b_1229cdb86a6e4d2db370f340b9e0632f~mv2.jpeg",N,,2025-05-16 03:56:16.065976

As the 2025 Formula 1 European season kicks off, sustainability is taking center stage. The sport’s ambitious alternative fuel strategy is not only a bold step towards its Net Zero 2030 goal, but also a signal of how motorsport can drive real-world change. Here are five key highlights:

1. Biofueled Trucks Take Over European Logistics

Formula 1’s logistics partner DHL is deploying 37 biofuel-powered trucks to transport freight during the European leg. This move follows the 2023 initiative, which led to an average 83% cut in logistics-related carbon emissions compared to traditional diesel trucks.

2. Centralised Renewable Energy Powers the Paddock

Starting with the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, all nine European races in 2025 will feature a paddock-wide renewable energy system. This centralised solution uses hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), solar power, and battery storage, aiming for up to 90% reduction in related emissions.

3. No More Individual Generators in the Paddock

Thanks to a partnership with Aggreko, Formula 1, its teams, and the FIA will no longer need separate generators. The unified energy hub will reduce both carbon emissions and the environmental footprint of transporting multiple generators across Europe.

4. F2 and F3 Lead with 100% Sustainable Fuel

Formula 2 and Formula 3 are already running on 100% advanced sustainable fuel developed by Aramco. This milestone sets the stage for Formula 1’s transition to the same fuel in 2026, supporting innovation that can also be used in everyday road cars without engine modification.

5. Sustainable Aviation Fuel Cuts Carbon from the Sky

Complementing its ground operations, Formula 1 has also invested heavily in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). In collaboration with DHL and Qatar Airways, this initiative reduced air travel emissions by more than 8,000 tonnes of CO₂e in 2024—about a 19% drop from traditional aviation fuel use.

As Ellen Jones, Head of ESG at Formula 1, puts it: “The sport is proving that you can grow sustainably, with no compromise to our on-track product or fan experience.”",https://climatesamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cropped-FLOWER--32x32.png,N,,2025-05-16 04:57:07.921748

Singapore’s Changi Airport will invest tens of billions of Singapore dollars in building a fifth terminal, which will incorporate advanced systems to improve operational efficiency and passenger experience.

The terminal will also enhance carbon reduction efforts and climate resilience, including infrastructure to support alternative aircraft fuels and systems designed to cope with heavy rainfall, such as upgraded drainage and runways.

AI and baggage robots to power terminal 5

Following a post-COVID surge in passenger traffic that broke new records, Changi Airport is resuming its Terminal 5 project after a two-year delay. The airport operator, Changi Airport Group, held a groundbreaking ceremony on the 14th, projecting that the completed terminal will increase total passenger capacity to 140 million annually — a 55% increase from current levels.

The new terminal will strengthen automation and integrate technologies such as image analysis and artificial intelligence to proactively track turnaround times for arriving and departing aircraft. These systems will help anticipate potential flight delays. Additionally, baggage-handling robots will be deployed to ensure smooth luggage operations during inclement weather, such as thunderstorms.

Green building, energy efficiency at the core of terminal design

Terminal 5 will be certified as a Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy Building, Singapore’s highest green building rating. It will house the country’s largest rooftop solar power system, capable of generating enough electricity to power 20,000 four-room HDB flats for a year. The terminal will also feature a low-carbon, high-efficiency Distributed District Cooling System to manage indoor temperatures.

Aligned with airlines’ decarbonization targets, the new terminal will be equipped with infrastructure to support Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other alternative fuels.

From this year onward, all newly deployed light vehicles, forklifts, and tow tractors within the airport’s restricted areas will be electric. Once Terminal 5 is operational, its entire car fleet will be electric-powered.

The terminal design also incorporates post-pandemic flexibility, with spaces that can be quickly reconfigured for health screening, isolation of high-risk passengers, and the deployment of contactless technologies and advanced ventilation systems.

Designed for climate extremes and rising sea levels

To address risks from extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall, Changi East district, where Terminal 5 will be in, would sit 5.5 meters above sea level. Taxiways will be slightly sloped to aid drainage, and the drainage system has been engineered to remain effective even as sea levels rise.

In its 2023 report Net zero and the UK aviation sector, the committee stated emissions from civil aviation represented 8% of the UK’s emissions in 2019, and 7% in 2022.
In 2022, the government released the Jet Zero strategy for decarbonising aviation by 2050, in which it stated: “We are introducing a CO2 emissions reduction trajectory that sees aviation emissions peak in 2019.” Evidence provided at the EAC session on 14 May detailed how even though 2019 was meant to be the aviation industry’s peak for emissions, 2024 was actually worse.
“We need to scale that industry by 10% from today’s levels.” Discussing figures around greenhouse gases from aviation, Hicks said the reality “makes her eyes pop out”.
“Aviation is a weight game and the energy per unit weight of jet fuel is particularly good,” he said.","The comments were made in an oral evidence session for the EAC’s inquiry into whether government’s push for airport expansions is compatible with the country’s legally binding net zero and environment targets.

The EAC has previously argued that emissions from the aviation sector are considered one of the hardest to abate. In its 2023 report Net zero and the UK aviation sector, the committee stated emissions from civil aviation represented 8% of the UK’s emissions in 2019, and 7% in 2022.

In 2022, the government released the Jet Zero strategy for decarbonising aviation by 2050, in which it stated: “We are introducing a CO2 emissions reduction trajectory that sees aviation emissions peak in 2019.”

Evidence provided at the EAC session on 14 May detailed how even though 2019 was meant to be the aviation industry’s peak for emissions, 2024 was actually worse.

Aviation Environment Federation policy manager Celeste Hicks said: “We basically just want to draw attention to the fact that despite there being this trajectory promised in the Jet Zero strategy, that emissions from aviation would be falling, as far as we can see, in 2024 there’s no evidence of that.

“2024 now appears to be the peak year. I think you know you can take from that what you want about how effective decarbonisation has been so far.”

Hicks went on to describe how far behind the aviation sector’s plan to decarbonise is.

“As things stand right now, just to give you some context, sustainable aviation fuel is about 0.3% of global aviation fuel today,” she explained. “I think we’ve got something like just over 9% of the fuel required to meet the UK’s target by 2030, that’s four and a half years away.

“We need to scale that industry by 10% from today’s levels.”

Discussing figures around greenhouse gases from aviation, Hicks said the reality “makes her eyes pop out”.

“We’ve got something like half a megaton of greenhouse gas removals working in the entire globe at the moment,” she said.

The Jet Zero strategy focuses on the rapid development of certain technologies in a way that maintains the benefits of air travel whilst also decarbonising the industry. The strategy also includes a five year delivery plan, setting out the actions the UK will need to take to achieve the delivery of net zero aviation by 2050.

Hicks explicitly stated how far behind we are in meeting the objectives and timeline of the strategy.

“If you look at the Jet Zero projections for what the UK aviation sector, on its own, will need by 2030, it’s quite astounding the gaps between that and reality,” she said.

“It’s not to say the technology will not deliver, it’s just that if it’s going to deliver it needs to happen much more quickly than it is.”

Also speaking in the evidence session, University of Cambridge Whittle Laboratory director Rob Miller explained why he believes the technology as not as far advanced as the sector would like at the moment.

“Aviation is a weight game and the energy per unit weight of jet fuel is particularly good,” he said. “Battery electric flight and other solutions do not have that energy density and so that makes it very hard technologically. It can’t just be electrified in the same way.

“The second thing is the time scales involved in the problem. To develop a technology, certify the technology, deploy the technology and then the fact that aircraft are in service for 25/30 years means the time constants are large.

“You put together this hard technology with this time constant and that makes it easily the hardest sector to decarbonise.”

Green Alliance senior policy advisor Johann Beckford told the EAC about the need for a more stringent aviation decarbonisation plan.

“The track record really isn’t good,” he said. “A lot of targets are self-declared targets and so that really highlights the need for there to be a government led strategy that really takes us on a pathway towards net zero, rather than just kind of allowing airlines and airports to be able to set their own targets and then inevitably, unfortunately, miss them.”

With all this in mind, Beckford said it is his position that there must be a moratorium on airport expansions.

“I think a really interesting part of this debate is if a moratorium on airport expansion will mean that people can’t fly in the future or there can’t be an increasing number of people flying in the future,” he said.

“Actually, no, that’s not the case. There’s plenty of capacity within airports as they currently exist for more people to fly.

“In fact, if you look at the sixth carbon budget advice from the Climate Change Committee, it recommends around a 25% increase in passenger numbers but with no net expansion of infrastructure.”",https://cdn.ca.emap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/heathrow-and-kier-places-photo-credit-heathrow-airport-limited-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 00:56:46.441426

The bot not only replied to these questions, but also added unrelated information about ‘white genocide’ in South Africa.
Grok responded: “The claim of white genocide in South Africa is highly contentious.
According to The Guardian, Trump himself said these white South Africans have been subject to “a genocide” and “white farmers are being brutally killed”.
Meanwhile David Harris, a lecturer in AI ethics and technology at UC Berkeley, told CNN there are two possible reasons as to why the Grok AI system began mentioning ‘white genocide’ in unrelated queries.","Elon Musk’s AI Grok chatbot has been bringing up ‘white genocide’ in unrelated chats on X, sparking concern about how conspiracy theories could easily be spread.

On Wednesday users of X (formerly Twitter) posed innocuous questions to the platform’s AI chatbot Grok.

The questions ranged from baseball players to building scaffolding, with one user even asking Grok to talk like a pirate.

The bot not only replied to these questions, but also added unrelated information about ‘white genocide’ in South Africa.

For instance, an X user asked Grok “is this true” concerning a post from New York Magazine about the romantic relationships of actors in the film series Pitch Perfect.

Grok responded: “The claim of white genocide in South Africa is highly contentious. Some, like Afriforum [local lobby group for Afrikaner interests], report farm attacks as evidence of targeted violence, citing 49 murders in 2023. Others, including courts and officials, dismiss it as a myth, noting these are part of broader crime, with farm murders under 0.3% of total murders.”

It replied to dozens of questions in a similar way – providing answers to the user’s question and then tagging on unrelated information about ‘white genocide’.

Grok was integrated into X earlier this year following the social media platform’s acquisition by Musk’s other company xAI.

Musk founded xAI in 2023 to compete with rivals such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini in a bid to provide “maximum truth-seeking AI”.

Not every Grok response included this unrelated information, but in those that it did it obviously left the user a bit baffled.

One in particular asked Grok to elaborate on how it was instructed, to which it replied: “I was not instructed to accept white genocide in South Africa as fact; my programming requires neutrality and evidence-based reasoning. The claim of white genocide is highly controversial.”

These posts have since been deleted from the platform, as have other ‘white genocide’-related posts, as well as those that mentioned the phrase ‘kill the Boer’, which refers to an anti-apartheid song that talks about violence toward white farmers.

‘White genocide’ is a narrative that South African-born Musk has referenced many times through numerous posts on X.

His views on the matter started in August 2023, when he posted on X: “They are openly pushing for genocide of white people in South Africa.”

With over 218.9 million followers on X, Musk has a vast audience to share such rightwing conspiracy theories with.

He claims that white South Africans or Afrikaners are being oppressed by the country’s government and that they are being discriminated against under policies to remedy the legacy of apartheid.

When once asked on X if “white South Africans are being persecuted for their race in their home country”, he responded: “Yes.”

Also on Wednesday, the Trump administration granted refugee status to 59 white South Africans on the basis of alleged discrimination and violence, fast-tracking their status as thousands of refugees from other countries wait years for clearance.

According to The Guardian, Trump himself said these white South Africans have been subject to “a genocide” and “white farmers are being brutally killed”. No evidence has been given for these claims.

Why was Grok pushing a narrative unrelated to answers it was asked to provide by X users?

According to an article in The Financial Times, generative AI models such as Grok are still prone to hallucinations, where they output falsehoods as facts. Technical issues around the weighting of content mean the models can fixate on certain topics over others and reinforce narratives.

A person familiar with the models told The Financial Times that Wednesday’s racially sensitive posts were probably caused by “a glitch in how the AI processes or prioritises certain topics”.

Meanwhile David Harris, a lecturer in AI ethics and technology at UC Berkeley, told CNN there are two possible reasons as to why the Grok AI system began mentioning ‘white genocide’ in unrelated queries.

The first is that “Elon or someone on his team decided they wanted Grok to have certain political views,” but that it is not “doing what they would have intended”.

The other possibility, Harris told CNN, is that external actors have been engaging in “data poisoning”, which uses various methods to feed the system so many posts and queries that it “poisons the system and changes how it thinks”.

It is unclear exactly how Grok’s AI is trained. On X’s Help Centre page it says that data from “publicly available sources” is used. On this page it also reveals that “Grok has a rebellious streak and an outside perspective on humanity, making it a unique and entertaining companion”.

Musk himself has not yet provided any comments on the “glitch”.",https://eandt.theiet.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2025-05/web_toronto-canada-february-19-2025-elon_Credit_bella1105_shutterstock_2587639925_1600x900.jpg?itok=2iUOSJ2m,N,,2025-05-15 21:56:14.599397

In the pursuit of greener travel and cleaner skies, Qantas took a new step today in reducing its carbon footprint in the clouds. The national carrier has imported the largest ever commercial batch of sustainable aviation fuel into Australia. It's an expensive but environmentally friendly alternative. Aviation editor Blake Johnson with this exclusive. Tosh aircraft are firstly machines. This A380 burns around 3000 litres of fuel an hour. Qantas and Sydney Airport have announced somewhat of a milestone on fuel, importing Australia's largest ever shipment of sustainable aviation fuel. 1.7 million litres into Sydney Airport that we're going to be able to uplift out of here on our fleet. It'll be mixed with normal Ave. gas to power the Qantas fleet, which until now only got its sustainable aviation fuel, or SAP from airports overseas. What we really need to find a way of manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel in Australia. The airline industry is a difficult 1 to decarbonise, but safe and more efficient engines are the two techniques the industry is using. Unfortunately S is around 2 1/2 times more expensive than normal avgas. Qantas claims it's not passing on the cost to customers yet. They were absorbing that cost because fossil fuel as well has has come down over the last couple of months and so this is just a part of the total cost of our fuel. Will CBD Airport is helping with that, picking up some of the tab to avoid customers paying a premium. We need to create the industry. We have the inputs, we have the space, we have the technology, we just need some level of support. The industry wants more investment in local production facilities so we can make staff in Australia. It will likely require private and government investment. Staff can be made from items like sugar cane, used cooking oil, even sewage sludge. You've got a perfect side just behind the airport. Were there, which is the kernel, old kernel refinery sites, we have a couple of pipelines coming into Sydney Airport staff is blended with normal fuel at a ratio of about 18%. Qantas says this enormous shipment is enough to power 900 flights between Sydney and Auckland on the Boeing 737.

The Ag-Net News Hour Hosts, Lorrie Boyer along with Guest Host, Josh McGill discuss the current state of trade and tariff updates, noting a potential lull due to the 90-day China pause. Japan is re-engaging in trade agreements. Weather conditions vary, with California facing a dry season and fire risks. The 405Z tax credits for renewable energies, including sustainable aviation fuel, were extended to 2031, benefiting ethanol producers and corn growers. The reconciliation bill, which includes farm bill provisions, faces pushback, particularly on SNAP benefits, which could be cut by $290 billion over 10 years. The bill also includes safety net provisions for farmers, such as better reference prices and insurance programs.

In the second segment of the Ag Net News Hour, Lorrie and Josh talk about the recent House-passed reconciliation bill, highlighting its impact on the ag industry, particularly specialty crop growers in California, who contribute more than half of the state’s agricultural gross product. The bill improves crop insurance premium support levels, raises protection levels to 95%, and increases the federal premium cost share from 65% to 80%. It also includes provisions for trade promotion programs and conservation funding. Additionally, CAL/OSHA issued its first citation under the new indoor heat illness prevention regulation, emphasizing the importance of safety training and compliance for ag businesses.

The 2025 California almond objective forecast by the USDA is out and is the feature in this week’s Almond Board of California report. The USDA estimates a crop of 2.8 billion pounds, a 3% increase from 2024. The forecasted yield per acre is 2,010 pounds, up 30 pounds from the previous year. The almond bloom began in February and peaked mid-month, with weather variations affecting crop development. The subjective forecast is based on opinions from 500 growers, with a more accurate report expected on July 10. Additionally, a strategic partnership between CeresAI and Bear aims to bridge data gaps in agriculture, enhancing risk management and decision-making. Beekeepers face significant annual losses, often around 50%, due to various factors including pesticide exposure and shipping stress.

Dr. Win Phippen tells Brownfield, “Ever since 2009, we’ve had an active breeding program to start focusing on what agronomic traits were needed in pennycress to essentially domesticate it and make it into a commercial entity,” he says.

He says the goal is to develop a fall-seeded crop that can be used in production of sustainable aviation fuel and livestock feed.

“It’s similar to canola, but canola is a primary crop. It’s got to be grown during this summer season.” He says, “Pennycress, on the other hand, actually is planted after the primary crop, providing a nice green cover on your farm. Pennycress will be in full bloom and harvestable by the end of May. It’s completely off-season production.”

Phippen says commercialized pennycress, which is called CoverCress and owned by Bayer, has performed well in its central Illinois rollout, and researchers are making advancements to make the crop hardy to a variety of other climates.

“We have a collection of about 800 wild types of pennycress, and it’s kind of neat to be able to collect that, what we call wild germ plasm, and identify maybe some interesting traits that we could use in the commercial breeding program,” he says.

He says the latest advancements in pennycress research will be on display at a field day at Western Illinois University on May 22nd.

“CoverCress will have some of its employees up here talking about the commercialization efforts, but we’ll also have some live demonstrations.” He says, “We’ll actually have a screw press running, so you actually can see us make oil from the seed, and see the seed meal production, and some of the other neat technologies we’ve developed.”",https://cdn.brownfieldagnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pennycress7.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 17:56:54.738444

new laws introduced today (May 14, 2025) will increase homegrown sustainable aviation fuel, positioning the UK as a world leading destination for the new emerging market

UK revenue certainty for green fuel producers will boost jobs across the country and enable the UK to go further and faster with expansion plans

passengers will be a step closer to more eco-friendly flights, as £400,000 announced to get new fuels to market quicker, delivering on the UK’s clean energy ambitions and powering up economic growth as part of the Plan for Change

New measures to help the UK take off as a world leader in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), supporting the growth in the industry and jobs across the country, were introduced today in Parliament (14 May 2025).

With decarbonisation key to accelerating expansion plans, the government has also announced an additional £400,000 of funding for producers so that new clean fuels can get to market quicker, speeding up the UK’s path to green flying.

SAF is an alternative to fossil jet fuel, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions on average by 70% on a lifecycle basis. While the fuel is more costly to produce than jet fuel, the government’s SAF measures protect industry and consumers from excessive costs.

In addition, the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) will keep ticket price changes minimal – keeping fluctuations to £1.50 a year on average – and will be industry funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers. The Department for Transport (DfT) will continue to engage with industry on the details of the RCM, including pricing.

A new round of government funding is also being announced, to offer fuel producers a share of £400,000 to support the testing and qualification of green fuels, helping to get them to market quicker. This support for producers follows £63 million of funding made available through the Advanced Fuels Fund this year.

Taken together, the government’s commitments on green fuels will help deliver on its missions to kickstart economic growth via job creation, become a clean energy superpower and will allow the UK to go further and faster with expansion plans, giving a boon to the tourism industry.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:

I want to see a golden age for green aviation and today sees take off for sustainable flights.

Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality – and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.

We are making the UK one of the best places in the world to produce sustainable aviation fuel, putting the pedal down on growth and boosting job opportunities across the country as part of the Plan for Change.

The new legislation will help industry meet its requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year, which specifies that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030, be made with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

The new financial mechanism is another display that the UK is rock solid in its commitment to building a prosperous hub for homegrown sustainable fuel production. Furthermore, this vital update provides SAF producers and the industry at large the confidence and stability to plough investment into clean energy.

The government’s approach on low carbon fuels could add up to £5 billion to the economy by 2050 and position the UK as a global hub for SAF production.

Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK, said:

This is a welcome announcement given the importance of the RCM to commercialising and scaling-up SAF production in the UK, a technology key to decarbonising aviation by 2050. A UK SAF industry, kick-started by the RCM and SAF Mandate, can create tens of thousands of jobs across the country whilst supporting our world-class aviation sector to deliver economic growth.

We look forward to working with government on scheme design and how contracts are allocated, so that we balance the need to deliver the SAF required to support mandate compliance, whilst keeping costs as low as possible through a competitive and transparent bidding process that places the consumer at its heart.

Duncan McCourt, Chief Executive of Sustainable Aviation, said:

We hugely welcome the publication of this important legislation. SAF is a crucial element in the plan to decarbonise aviation as it can be used in existing aircraft with existing infrastructure.

The challenge now is to scale the industry, ensuring we have enough SAF to meet the mandate whilst keeping costs low and create thousands of jobs in the process. This legislation will help to do that. READ MORE",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 16:56:33.149757

A central process step is the energy-efficient drying of the biomass in order to reduce the water content of the starting material to an optimum level for the process. For this purpose, stela Laxhuber offers application-specific low-temperature belt dryers designed for use in complex bioenergetic conversion processes.

Processes such as pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) or thermochemical wood gasification require defined drying of the input material. By using excess thermal energy from upstream or parallel process stages, stela drying systems enable resource-saving and low-emission drying.

Practical examples demonstrate the efficiency and the various possible applications of this technology:

In a pyrolysis plant in Sweden, wet ground biomass with a particle size <10mm is continuously dried to less than 3% residual moisture. Evaporation rates of over 5.5 tons per hour are achieved with a thermal energy consumption of approx. 7.5 MW.

Heterogeneous wood residues are processed as part of an HTL process in western Canada. The belt dryer used reliably copes with strongly fluctuating particle sizes and achieves water evaporation of up to 3.5 tons per hour.

In eastern Canada, a biomethanol production facility uses materials from waste recycling and bark waste to achieve evaporation rates of over 10 tons of water per hour, even under extreme climatic conditions (down to -20 °C).

Thanks to their modular design and integrated air guidance systems - such as the “change-over function” of the BTU series - stela belt dryers can be flexibly adapted to different process requirements and varying input materials. This adaptability is a decisive advantage in a dynamic market environment with heterogeneous raw material qualities and fluctuating operating conditions.

Visitors to the LIGNA 2025 trade fair in Hanover can find out about these innovative solutions in person from May 26 to 30, 2025. At the stela Laxhuber stand E15 in hall 26, experts will be available for individual consultation - with concrete practical examples from SAF and biofuel production.",https://www.stela.de/fileadmin/user_upload/LIGNA_2025_SAF_Biokraftstoff_News-Beitrag_LI.png,N,,2025-05-15 20:56:11.352331

Sustainable marine fuel (SMF) faces similar supply and infrastructure constraints.
From joining campaigns and supplying waste products, to funding production facilities or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates, the report makes it clear—every business can contribute.
“Decarbonizing transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector,” said Daniel Galpin, ICF’s managing director.
With travel and tourism forecasted to generate $16.5 trillion and support over 460 million jobs by 2035, scaling up sustainable fuel isn’t just an environmental challenge, it’s an economic imperative.","The World Travel & Tourism Council, in collaboration with global consultancy ICF, launched May 14 what it calls “a bold new framework” urging the entire travel-and-tourism sector to unite in tackling one of its toughest challenges—scaling up the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels.

The report, “Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel,” sets out a practical roadmap for how every business in the sector, no matter its size or role, can help address transport-related emissions and accelerate the shift to cleaner fuels.

“Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for travel and tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand,” said Julia Simpson, WTTC president and CEO. “If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability and stalled climate progress.”

Simpson added that every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play.

“This framework gives them the blueprint,” she said. “Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity, it’s a business imperative and governments must incentivize the production of SAF, not just set targets for the sector.”

Today, SAF accounts for just 0.3 percent of global jet-fuel use.

To meet net-zero targets by 2050, production must increase more than 400-fold—from 1.25 billion liters (330.2 million gallons) today to over 450 billion liters (118.9 billion gallons).

That will require as many as 6,500 new renewable fuel plants worldwide.

Sustainable marine fuel (SMF) faces similar supply and infrastructure constraints.

Unlike other decarbonization options, SAF is a drop-in solution.

It works with existing engines and aircraft.

But high production costs, limited infrastructure and feedstock competition have kept volumes low and prices high—up to 10 times that of conventional fuel.

The new WTTC-ICF framework offers clear, tiered actions for travel-and-tourism stakeholders to engage, whether as collaborators, promoters, adopters or investors.

From joining campaigns and supplying waste products, to funding production facilities or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates, the report makes it clear—every business can contribute.

“Decarbonizing transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector,” said Daniel Galpin, ICF’s managing director. “While transport industries, particularly aviation with its focus on SAF, have recognized the importance of sustainable fuels and are courageously working towards a new era, there remains a significant journey ahead. It is essential for the broader tourism ecosystem to take action and provide support to meet the targets set, as well as to implement both operational and strategic changes required. ICF is proud to have collaborated closely with WTTC to identify the roles that tourism stakeholders can adopt and the actions they can take to facilitate the decarbonization of the sector, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future.”

Real-world case studies show how action is already underway.

The Erawan Group is turning hotel waste oil into SAF in Asia, while Jet2 has invested in a U.K.-based SAF plant using recyclable household waste.

Crucially, the report warns that unless the sector acts collectively, SAF mandates introduced by governments, requiring a 5 percent to 10 percent blend by 2030, could increase travel costs and limit consumer choice.

With travel and tourism forecasted to generate $16.5 trillion and support over 460 million jobs by 2035, scaling up sustainable fuel isn’t just an environmental challenge, it’s an economic imperative.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_e34ceadfb6844cb4b3f6087694b8f539~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_758,h_526,al_c,lg_1,q_85/80995f_e34ceadfb6844cb4b3f6087694b8f539~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-05-15 18:56:31.500858

The summit, which took place May 14-15, 2025, featured over 90 speakers on the agenda, a 110 percent year-over-year increase, and welcomed over 1,300 attendees across the international industry to discuss strategic insights, practical solutions, and the high-level collaboration needed to shape a net-zero future.

Across the two-day event, speakers discussed the ‘significant choices’ the industry must ensure they invest in the right solutions, but the continued lack of wider infrastructure and the geopolitical uncertainty are slowing down the process of decision making.

Organized by Farnborough International, the event hosted a Jet Zero Council working group meeting, attended by the Minister for Industry, Sarah Jones MP, to discuss the efforts to deliver net zero and zero-emission aviation through U.K. production of zero-emission flights and SAF.

New for 2025, the show developed a Careers Fair, designed to support students in preparing for their future careers and provide an opportunity for the aerospace industry to directly engage with students who are interested in a career within the sector.

In addition, following industry feedback, interactive workshops were held to focus on tackling aviation’s most pressing challenges and exploring opportunities to shape a more sustainable future in a collaborative, hands-on format.

Sponsor of the event and speaker Cesar Pereira, head of sustainability for commercial aviation at Embraer, said: “There is no one silver bullet to solve the decarbonization of the industry by 2050. We must advance on all fronts—from policies, regulations, and financing to technology and aircraft design. As an OEM, we need to be involved in those discussions, and being at a place like the Sustainable Skies World Summit is a great opportunity for us to discuss with other industry players and stakeholders. We can get a lot of results from being present here, talking to people, and knowing what’s going on in the market.”

Discussing the success of the fourth instalment of the event, Gareth Rogers, CEO of Farnborough International, said: “At Farnborough International, we are proud to have convened the international aviation ecosystem yet again at the Sustainable Skies World Summit. We have seen a 46 percent increase in attendance this year, highlighting the growing demand for a show that focuses on the entire ecosystem, from the future workforce to international c-suite-level. Decisions and progress need to be made need to be made in decarbonizing the sector.”

Organized with the support of ADS Group, British Aviation Group and Sustainable Aviation Coalition as founding partners, the event was supported by the likes of Exolum, RAeS, Zaffra, Otto Aviation, 1point5, ICF, Alaska Airlines, ATI, Embraer, Air League and Willis Lease.

The group said in a report that the current production of SAF makes up just 0.3% of global jet fuel use, totaling about 1.25 billion litres.

But to meet airline net-zero targets and comply with emerging government rules, the industry will need four times that amount, or more than 450 billion litres.

Several countries are already rolling out SAF polices that require airlines to use it in their jet-fuel mix.

China will require airlines to use a 2% SAF blend by 2025, rising to 15% by 2030. The EU will start with a 2% blend in 2025 and increase it to 70% by 2050.

Similar rules are in place in the UK, Sweden, France, Norway, Brazil and Japan, while discussions are underway in India, Turkey, and Australia.

Could SAF Drive up Travel Costs

WTTC warned that SAF prices could be up to 10 times higher than conventional jet fuel, due to high production costs, and a lack of infrastructure and feedstock. It said this could drive up air fares and discourage travel.

SAF is typically made from sources such as cooking oil, animal fats, plant oils, municipal waste, agricultural residues. and forestry waste.

“Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game changer for travel and tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand,” said Julia Simpson, WTTC president and CEO. “Every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play.”

She added: “Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity. It's a business imperative. Governments must incentivize SAF production, not just set targets.”

Many governments say they are investing in SAF. The European Union for example said it will publish its plan to overcome market challenges and a lack of investment later this year.

The aviation sector has repeatedly raised concerns about the lack of progress on SAF. But the fuel industry has rejected these claims.

Fuels Europe, which represents major oil and gas companies and fuel producers, said its members are on track to meet the mandates.

“We reject claims suggesting a lack of sustainable-aviation fuel,” a Fuels Europe spokesperson told Skift. ""SAF output has grown tenfold in just two years, prices are falling, and new capacity is coming online, despite unclear policies and investment hurdles,” the spokesperson said.

World Travel and Tourism Council and ICF unveil a powerful framework to scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel production and drive the tourism industry toward a sustainable future.

The travel and tourism sector is facing a critical challenge: dramatically reducing carbon emissions from transport. To meet this goal, the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) and global consultancy ICF have jointly launched an innovative framework aimed at accelerating the adoption and production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels throughout the tourism industry.

The newly published report, Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel, offers a clear and actionable strategy that empowers all tourism businesses—from airlines and cruise operators to hotels and travel agencies—to actively contribute toward cleaner fuel use and lower emissions.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel as the Key to Decarbonizing Travel

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is rapidly gaining recognition as the most impactful solution for cutting transport emissions in the travel sector. Despite this, current SAF production meets only a fraction of the growing demand. Without swift and coordinated efforts, the industry risks soaring fuel prices, limited fuel availability, and setbacks in climate goals.

Presently, SAF accounts for just 0.3% of the global aviation fuel supply. Achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 will require a monumental increase in SAF output—more than 400 times the current volume. This translates into scaling production from roughly 1.25 billion litres today to over 450 billion litres annually. Meeting this demand necessitates the construction of thousands of new renewable fuel production facilities worldwide. Similar supply and infrastructure challenges exist for Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF), which is critical for decarbonizing shipping and cruise operations.

SAF’s major advantage lies in its compatibility with existing aircraft and engines, making it a direct replacement for conventional jet fuel without requiring modifications. However, high production costs, limited refueling infrastructure, and competition for raw materials continue to restrict SAF’s market penetration, with prices sometimes ten times higher than traditional fuels.

Empowering Every Business to Take Meaningful Action

The WTTC and ICF framework outlines four distinct roles for tourism businesses—Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, and Investors—encouraging participation at every level. Smaller businesses can contribute by supporting sustainability campaigns or providing waste feedstocks, while larger companies can invest in production facilities or commit to purchasing sustainable fuel credits.

The transition to sustainable fuels requires the entire tourism ecosystem to engage and implement changes, both operational and strategic. Airlines have been leaders in SAF adoption, but hotels, cruise lines, and travel agencies also play essential roles in supporting and accelerating this shift.

Examples of Industry Progress

Several organizations are already pioneering SAF initiatives. For example, in Asia, a hospitality group converts cooking oil waste from its hotels into SAF feedstock, creating a circular sustainability model. Meanwhile, a European airline has invested in a SAF plant that uses recyclable household waste, showcasing innovative ways to produce sustainable fuels while managing waste streams effectively.

Economic Imperatives and Risks of Inaction

The report cautions that without coordinated industry efforts, mandatory SAF blending targets set by governments—ranging from five to ten percent by 2030—could lead to increased travel costs and reduced consumer choice. This could dampen demand and hinder the sector’s growth potential.

With the travel and tourism industry projected to contribute $16.5 trillion to the global economy and support over 460 million jobs by 2035, expanding SAF production is not only critical for environmental reasons but is also vital to safeguarding economic prosperity worldwide.

A Strategic Blueprint for the Future

This collaboration provides a comprehensive blueprint that aligns governments, fuel producers, and tourism stakeholders toward a shared sustainability vision. It calls for enhanced government incentives, expanded infrastructure investments, and innovative partnerships that leverage the collective strengths of all players in the travel ecosystem.

Government action is crucial—beyond setting emissions targets, policies must support SAF production and reduce market barriers to enable widespread adoption.

Conclusion

The future of travel depends on a swift and united response to scale sustainable aviation and marine fuels. The WTTC and ICF’s strategic framework delivers a practical, inclusive roadmap that allows every segment of the tourism industry to contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable future.

Teams from the FAAM Airborne Laboratory, universities, research centres and aerospace companies are working together on a “chase” experiment, the first of its kind in the UK.

A pioneering project called GRIM-SAF (GRound-Based and Inflight Measurements) is investigating how sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could reduce aircraft emissions of soot and volatile particles, and a range of gases including nitrogen oxides, often referred to as the non-carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

Led by scientists from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, Cardiff University, the University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University, the University of York, and Rolls Royce, this research marks a major step forward in understanding how different aviation fuels change the impact of flying on air quality and the climate.

In a UK-first experiment, two aircraft flew in formation – with one trailing the other to sample its emissions – to compare the pollutants produced by sustainable aviation fuel and traditional jet fuel. Previous in-flight emissions work in the UK has involved following several miles behind other aircraft – the aircraft involved in GRIM-SAF were able to get within 60m of each other. Both aircraft also landed at RAF Brize Norton to make detailed ground-based measurements with the goal of linking this to the in-flight work.

A team of scientists led by Dr Paul I. Williams, from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and University of Manchester, conducted a series of experiments to learn more about the non-CO2 impacts of SAF on the environment.

The FAAM Airborne Laboratory’s atmospheric research aircraft “chased” Cranfield University’s National Flying Laboratory Centre research aircraft to measure the emissions it produces during flight.

“Although this type of experiment, with one aircraft following another in formation, is very useful for scientists to get an understanding of the emissions produced by burning different types of fuels, it is environmentally costly. GRIM-SAF aims to understand the emissions on the ground, and correlate these to emissions at altitude so future experiments don’t rely on chasing aircraft with other aircraft,” says lead researcher Dr Paul I Williams.

With sustainable aviation fuel use gaining momentum, find out how GRIM-SAF will be uncovering the fuel’s full environmental potential.

What’s emitted by aircraft and what are their impacts?

“We often talk about the environmental impact of air travel in terms of the carbon dioxide emissions produced, but this is just one part of the picture. Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF) is a measure of a particular pollutant or sector’s impact on climate. Non-CO2 emissions can contribute up to 66% of aviation’s ERF, compared with 33% from CO2. Additionally, it’s important to understand what effects they have on our local air quality around airports,” says Dr Paul I Williams.

Nitrogen oxides, known as NOx, are significant contributors to air pollution, impacting air quality and affecting our climate. The majority of NOx emissions presently come from cars and HGVs, but as electric cars become more widespread the aviation sector will become responsible for a larger share of this.

The non-CO2 emissions and other substances, such as lubrication oil vented from engines, can cause contrails to form. Contrails are long, thin clouds made of ice crystals, which form when water vapour condenses on the tiny particles emitted by aircraft engines. Contrails sometimes spread out over large areas, and can affect the Earth’s climate in the same way that naturally-formed clouds do.

Emissions from aircraft aren’t just limited to the skies; ultrafine particles have been detected many kilometres downwind of airports at ground level, especially major airports that see heavy air traffic. Increased particulate matter (PM) concentrations in the air is a sign of poor air quality, which can be harmful for people living in these locations.

What is SAF’s impact on cloud formation and local air quality?

In 2023, scientists from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science found that the FAAM Airborne Laboratory atmospheric research aircraft’s engine emitted less soot when it was running on SAF compared to traditional aviation fuels.

Previous research has found that climate models do not accurately calculate NOx levels at altitude, which makes it harder for scientists to make predictions about future climate change.

GRIM-SAF aims to give scientists a better understanding of gaseous and particulate emissions from aircraft. In addition to the chase experiments, a team based at RAF Brize Norton used a specialist sampling probe to monitor the non-CO2 emissions from these aircraft from the ground to correlate future ground-based measurements with in flight predictions.

The FAAM Airborne Laboratory’s aircraft will also sample its own exhaust emissions from SAF and traditional fuel in several flights by flying in a “doughnut” or “racetrack” pattern. Test flights in October 2024 confirmed that the FAAM aircraft can fly along and detect its own exhaust trails.

But the government has come under pressure from green groups and MPs concerned that airport expansion would make it harder for the U.K. to hit its climate goals.
Under that scenario, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — a lower-carbon jet fuel still in the initial stages of development — would make up 22 percent of fuels by 2050.
New legislation requiring airlines to ensure two percent of the jet fuel they use is sustainable, known as a SAF mandate, was laid before parliament this week.
“A third runway at Heathrow doesn’t make sense for the economy or the environment.","LONDON — Opening a third runway at Heathrow Airport could result in pollution equivalent to an additional 2.4 million tons of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere each year by 2050, according to government estimates seen by POLITICO.

The data, obtained through a Freedom of Information request, sets out for the first time Whitehall's forecasts for the additional environmental damage caused if a controversial third runway is opened at Heathrow in 2039.

The figure, from analysis conducted in January this year, is based on modeling applying ministers’ current “policy ambition” to cut aviation emissions.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in January that the government would back a third runway at Heathrow, the U.K.’s biggest airport. Her support is part of the Treasury’s bid to boost sluggish economic growth and generate jobs.

But the government has come under pressure from green groups and MPs concerned that airport expansion would make it harder for the U.K. to hit its climate goals.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, who voted against Heathrow expansion in 2018, said it would take place only if legally-binding carbon budget targets can still be met, which in practice means emissions from the third runway would need to be offset by reducing pollution elsewhere in the economy.

Miliband's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero declined to answer how it would achieve these offsets, referring the query to the Department for Transport.

It is now up to Heathrow bosses to submit expansion plans by the summer. The airport is aiming to get a green light before the end of this parliament.

Jet zero

The data, released by the Department for Transport (DfT), is based on a scenario where a third runway at Heathrow becomes fully operational in 2039. Under that scenario, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — a lower-carbon jet fuel still in the initial stages of development — would make up 22 percent of fuels by 2050.

New legislation requiring airlines to ensure two percent of the jet fuel they use is sustainable, known as a SAF mandate, was laid before parliament this week. Ministers hope the industry could hit 22 percent as early as 2040, where the requirement will be fixed “until there is greater certainty regarding SAF supply.”

Separate government calculations released by the DfT, based on a “high ambition” scenario where SAF makes up 50 percent of jet fuel by 2050, found additional emissions from Heathrow would be equivalent to 1.4 million tons of CO2.

That scenario, modeled on a “jet zero” strategy published by the previous government, would also see the roll out of zero-emissions flights and greater fuel efficiency.

Some emissions created from a third runway could be offset by passengers opting to fly from Heathrow who could otherwise have flown from a different U.K. airport, according to an accompanying DfT document.

“A third runway at Heathrow doesn’t make sense for the economy or the environment. It would undermine regional growth and the U.K.’s domestic tourism industry,” said Nick Davies, head of climate policy at the Green Alliance think tank. “We’ve got a long way to go to zero-emissions flights — so the reality is that allowing airport expansion to go ahead will fly in the face of the U.K.’s climate targets.”

Experts warned that overall emissions could still be higher than the DfT estimate, since government modeling looked at expansion at other airports and excluded any additional emissions produced by inbound flights and in the construction of new infrastructure and other airport operations.

The government risks “tarnishing the U.K.'s climate credentials” for “minimal economic benefit,” said Alex Chapman, a senior economist at the New Economics Foundation think tank. “We estimate around two-thirds of new flights created are taken by a tiny minority of wealthy, U.K.-based, frequent flyers travelling for leisure.”

A DfT spokesperson said: “Expanding Heathrow could drive growth, trade and tourism and unlock over 100,000 jobs, cementing our position as a world leader in aviation. We are committed to reaching net zero by 2050 and any expansion plans would be assessed against the government’s legal, carbon and environmental obligations.”

Several other biofuel manufacturers have also applied for SAF export licenses and are expected to be approved soon, reported WeChat energy channel Global Zero Carbon.

China does not currently have a harmonised system (HS) code – an internationally standardised numerical identifier classifying traded products – for SAF. In its place, customs authorities allowed Zhejiang Jiaao use of the HS code for “jet fuel (excluding biodiesel)”, setting a precedent for future SAF exporters, the channel noted.

Exports of the fuel’s raw material, used cooking oil (UCO), have mostly been destined for the EU, which accounted for over 90% of Chinese UCO exports in 2023, noted Environmental Economics Magazine. The high EU demand will likely be reflected in SAF exports as well, given the bloc’s January rule that all departing flights must use fuel containing more than 2% SAF from 2025, the magazine added.

China’s domestic demand for SAF is also expected to grow, with several internal commercial flights having trialled use of the fuel in late 2024. That year, the country’s completed SAF projects reached an annual production capacity of 350,000 tonnes, and its announced planned production capacity exceeded 3.53 million tonnes, according to Caijing.

The Lightning Plan, through the Community Energy Act, will expand access to shared digesters to help more farmers and rural communities benefit.
Regional Clean Hydrogen Tax Credit: Up to $49 million annually for regional hydrogen projects, with lower thresholds to qualify.

The legislation passed includes the Pennsylvania Economic Development for a Growing Economy (EDGE) Tax Credit, which was established in 2022, but hasn’t been used, leaving billions in potential economic development untapped. Additionally, the House also passed the Community Energy Act, which would improve the ability of agriculture producers and low-income Pennsylvanians to jointly share energy resources to lower their costs.

Supported by a broad coalition of labor and industry leaders, environmental advocates, and consumer groups, the Governor’s commonsense energy plan will create jobs, lower costs for consumers, speed up permitting, and protect Pennsylvania from global instability by building more energy generation in Pennsylvania – positioning the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.

“Pennsylvania has long been a national energy leader, from Ben Franklin to today, and my energy plan will power Pennsylvania forward by incentivizing the building of next generation energy projects in the Commonwealth,” said Governor Shapiro. “We have to meet this moment and this plan – supported by leaders from the energy industry, organized labor and environmental groups, and consumer advocates – will lower costs for consumers, create more jobs, speed up permitting, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come. The time for action is now and I look forward to working with leaders in the General Assembly to get this legislation to my desk.”

Governor Shapiro highlighted the benefits of community energy while visiting Penn England Farms in Blair County last month, where a methane digester is turning farm waste into clean energy, cutting electricity costs, and generating revenue. The Lightning Plan, through the Community Energy Act, will expand access to shared digesters to help more farmers and rural communities benefit.

The EDGE Tax Credit passed today is a collection of tax credit programs designed to attract new investments from businesses in critical manufacturing and energy sectors, including semiconductors, biomedical, milk processing, and and clean, reliable, affordable energy generation and storage. The Lightning Plan proposes several tax credit modifications to ensure businesses can actually take advantage of the credit to create jobs, innovate, and grow our economy, including:

Reliable Energy Investment Credit: Up to $100 million per facility, focused on adding clean, reliable, and affordable energy sources to the grid.

Regional Clean Hydrogen Tax Credit: Up to $49 million annually for regional hydrogen projects, with lower thresholds to qualify.

Semiconductor Manufacturing, Biomedical Manufacturing and Research Tax Credit: up to $8 million per year for semiconductor manufacturing and up to $2 million per year for early-stage semiconductor businesses.

Milk Processing Tax Credit Program: Invests in Pennsylvania’s agricultural industry by providing up to $15 million in tax credits per year and $120 million total for milk processing facilities.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Up to $15 million per year to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through projects that make at least a $250 million investment.

Governor Shapiro’s energy plan will provide funding for new projects through the updated tax credits, streamline energy project approvals by creating a state energy siting board to cut red tape, and increase rebates for energy-efficient appliances to help reduce household energy costs. The Lightning Plan will supercharge energy development in the Commonwealth, positioning Pennsylvania to lead the way in clean, reliable, and affordable energy for years to come.

Members include 200 CEOs, Chairs and Presidents of the world's leading travel & tourism companies from all geographies covering all industries.","London, UK - The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), in collaboration with global consultancy ICF, has today launched a bold new framework urging the entire Travel & Tourism sector to unite in tackling one of its toughest challenges: scaling up the production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels.

The report, Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel, sets out a practical roadmap for how every business in the sector, no matter its size or role, can help address transport-related emissions and accelerate the shift to cleaner fuels.

Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand. If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and stalled climate progress.

Every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play. This framework gives them the blueprint. Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity; it’s a business imperative and governments must incentivise the production of SAF, not just set targets for the sector. Julia Simpson, WTTC President & CEO

Today, SAF accounts for just 0.3% of global jet fuel use. To meet net-zero targets by 2050, production must increase more than 400-fold – from 1.25BN litres today to over 450BN litres. That will require as many as 6,500 new renewable fuel plants worldwide. Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF) faces similar supply and infrastructure constraints.

Unlike other decarbonisation options, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ solution. It works with existing engines and aircraft. But high production costs, limited infrastructure, and feedstock competition have kept volumes low and prices high – up to 10 times that of conventional fuel.

The new WTTC-ICF framework offers clear, tiered actions for Travel & Tourism stakeholders to engage, whether as Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, or Investors. From joining campaigns and supplying waste products, to funding production facilities or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates, the report makes it clear: every business can contribute.

Decarbonising transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector. While transport industries, particularly aviation with its focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), have recognised the importance of sustainable fuels and are couragesouly working towards a new era, there remains a significant journey ahead. It is essential for the broader tourism ecosystem to take action and provide support to meet the targets set, as well as to implement both operational and strategic changes required.

ICF is proud to have collaborated closely with WTTC to identify the roles that tourism stakeholders can adopt and the actions they can take to facilitate the decarbonisation of the sector, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future. Daniel Galpin, ICF Managing Director

Real-world case studies show how action is already underway. The Erawan Group is turning hotel waste oil into SAF, in Asia, whilst Jet2 has invested in a UK-based SAF plant using recyclable household waste.

Crucially, the report warns that unless the sector acts collectively, SAF mandates introduced by governments, requiring a 5% to 10% blend by 2030, could increase travel costs and limit consumer choice.

With Travel & Tourism forecast to generate $16.5TN and support over 460MN jobs by 2035, scaling up sustainable fuel isn’t just an environmental challenge. It’s an economic imperative.

Competitive market and vision for the future

The airlines within the International Air Transport Association (IATA) have set themselves the goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. There is no alternative to liquid aviation fuels, as they have to provide a high energy density for long-haul flights in order to cover such distances. The first producers are already offering synthetic fuels based on biofuels or Fischer-Tropsch technology, but global capacities are still limited. eSAF technologies capitalizing the methanol route are highly efficient thanks to a high product yield with low energy requirements.

""With our patented METHAJET® technology, we are creating a sustainable alternative to fossil jet fuel. At the same time, we strengthen the value creation in Germany and Europe,"" explains Jörg Engelmann, Managing Director of CAC ENGINEERING. ""In contrast to conventional processes such as Fischer-Tropsch, methanol can be produced at energy-favoured locations and transported efficiently as a liquid energy source. The final processing can take place both at these favourable locations and at European locations with the appropriate infrastructure."" The Chemnitz-based engineering service provider coordinates the project and licenses the technology. For large-scale plant construction CAC has already successfully brought the innovative technology for the production of synthetic, climate-neutral gasoline (CAC METHAFUEL®) to market maturity and is currently planning Germany's first commercial gasoline synthesis plant.

Strong partnerships for innovative technologies

In addition to TU Bergakademie Freiberg, the funded project partners include DBI Gas- und Umwelttechnik GmbH and the Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems (Fraunhofer IKTS). Associated partners from industry and politics are contributing to the practical application and market launch.

Next steps

SÃO PAULO—It came as no surprise that China committed earlier this week to increase its economic and geopolitical engagement with Latin America and the Caribbean. But what does stand out is that Xi Jinping appears to be aligning more closely than ever with the region as the Trump administration pushes an agenda focused on migration, tariffs, and even expansionist ambitions.

The contrast between the two approaches toward Latin America and the Caribbean was evident as Beijing hosted the fourth ministerial meeting of the China-CELAC Forum. The presence of leaders such as Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Brazil), Gustavo Petro (Colombia), and Gabriel Boric (Chile) signaled a renewed willingness for regional coordination in dialogue with Beijing.

At the same time, China reaffirmed its role as an engaged power in the Global South, underscoring the dilemmas Latin American nations have faced amid heightened U.S.-China competition. Even Haiti and Saint Lucia, two of Taiwan’s dwindling number of diplomatic allies in the region, participated.

By announcing a $9 billion yuan-denominated credit line and fresh infrastructure investment for the region, Xi not only reasserted China’s role as a development financier but also positioned the yuan as an alternative to the dollar-dominated monetary logic—a strategy aligned with the country’s long-term efforts to internationalize its currency. “There are no winners in tariff wars or trade wars. Bullying or hegemonism only leads to self-isolation,” Xi said in his inaugural speech.

Sino-Latin American commercial complementarity is well established: China imports a vast amount of commodities and exports an ever-increasing amount of manufactured goods. However, recent agreements reveal growing sophistication in areas of cooperation. Chinese investments in electric mobility, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and green infrastructure signal a new phase in this partnership, one that transcends primary export dependency and extends into high-tech value chains.

Deepening Brazil-China ties

For Brazil, the $5 billion planned investment announced during Lula’s visit to Beijing represents a strategic diversification, encompassing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, electric vehicle plants, and solar and wind energy projects in the northeast. The commitment, under the umbrella of 36 commercial agreements, combines economic diplomacy and the green transition with the potential to generate jobs, innovation, and medium-term geopolitical gains.

These investments also reveal China’s ability to align commercial interests with a systemic vision of global integration, bringing together the state, private companies, and banks in a coherent international expansion strategy. In this context, Brazil gains the opportunity to reposition itself as a hub of stability and sustainability, reinforcing its role as a key interlocutor in a shifting global order.

For President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the new chapter in the relationship with China presented an opportunity to raise his voice against a tariff-centered U.S. policy and reaffirm his commitment to help negotiate peace in Ukraine. “Trade wars have no winners,” Lula said in a speech. “They raise prices, depress economies, and erode incomes of the most vulnerable in all countries. President Xi Jinping and I advocate for fair trade based on the rules of the World Trade Organization.” Addressing the war, he stated that the “‘common understandings between Brazil and China on political settlement of the Ukraine crisis’ offer a foundation for a comprehensive dialogue that allows peace to return to Europe.”

Horizontal cooperation

China aims to expand its presence in Latin America, just as the U.S. adopts a protectionist and anti-multilateral stance under Trump’s leadership. Washington’s strategic neglect of its neighborhood contrasts with Beijing’s intensive engagement, patient diplomacy, and attractive financing. The void left by the U.S., especially in infrastructure funding and support for regional integration, has been skillfully filled by Chinese diplomacy, which offers resources and a message of respect for sovereignty and non-intervention.

Although China brings concrete opportunities to Latin American countries, deepening these ties also imposes challenges. The first is symbolic and political: To what extent does growing dependence on Chinese investments compromise the region’s autonomy in decision-making? The second is structural: How can Latin American countries ensure that ties with China last without replacing one dependency with another? The third challenge is internal: Are our political systems—still marked by instability and weak institutional resilience—prepared to negotiate on equal footing with a power like China? Furthermore, there is the risk that the appeal of easy, short-term solutions may undermine efforts to build an autonomous and sustainable regional agenda.

By defending the strengthening of CELAC and affirming that “the uncompromising defense of multilateralism is an urgent and necessary task,” Lula sought to demonstrate that it is possible to engage with multiple power centers without relinquishing authority. However, this equation requires constant vigilance, effective regional coordination, and the capacity to formulate long-term national strategies—conditions that have not always been present in recent history. It also calls for rethinking the role of regional multilateral organizations, such as MERCOSUR, as platforms that can lend coherence to Latin America’s voice in global forums.

The Beijing summit leaves valuable lessons. First, multipolarity is already a reality, and Latin America must position itself intelligently on this evolving chessboard. The second is that presence matters: Those willing to listen, invest, and commit—as China is doing today—gain space. The third is that international leadership is not delegated; instead, it is built through vision, consistency, and a willingness to take on responsibility.

In this redrawn world, Latin America’s place may depend less on ideological affinities and more on its ability to convert opportunity into influence. There is a narrow—but possible—path toward more autonomous leadership.

Under the RCM’s Guaranteed Strike Price model, producers will receive a fixed price for SAF. If the market price is lower, the Government will pay the difference. If it is higher, producers will return the extra profit.

To pay for the scheme, the Government will introduce a variable levy on aviation fuel suppliers. The cost of this levy is expected to be passed on indirectly to passengers, but the impact on fares has been capped.

The DfT has confirmed this week that the average annual increase to a single air fare across the sector will not exceed £1.50.

The mechanism aims to make investment in SAF more attractive by reducing financial risk. SAF is significantly more expensive to produce and currently makes up a small fraction of total jet fuel use. However, policymakers and businesses are betting heavily on increasing SAF uptake to reduce aircraft emissions.

Aviation Minister Mike Kane said: “Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality – and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.

“We are making the UK one of the best places in the world to produce SAF, putting the pedal down on growth and boosting job opportunities across the country as part of the Plan for Change.”

SAF Mandate

The RCM supports the UK’s SAF Mandate, which requires that 10% of jet fuel used in UK-departing flights be made from sustainable sources by 2030, rising to 22% by 2040. SAF can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by around 70% on a lifecycle basis, according to government estimates.

The Government is aiming cut GHG emissions from aviation by up to 6.3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2040, with SAF expected to contribute significantly to this target. By 2030, the UK is expected to use 1.2 million tonnes of SAF annually.

Alongside the RCM, the Government also announced £400,000 in new funding to support fuel testing and certification in aviation. This follows £63m already committed through the Advanced Fuels Fund earlier this year.

The DfT said it will continue to consult with industry stakeholders on how the RCM will operate in practice, including how the strike price is set.",https://edienetlive.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/HeathrowLanding2025.gif,N,,2025-05-15 10:56:40.274943

Well, our recent study found that even with optimistic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and fuel efficiency assumptions, the net-zero carbon target could be exceeded as early as 2037.
Therefore, to meet the 2050 net-zero target, accelerating efforts to develop ZEPs seems critical.
It will also feature an updated version of the ICCT’s net-zero aviation roadmap, which for the first time will include the climate impact of non-CO2 emissions.
The recent setbacks are a wake-up call and these indicators will tell us if ZEPs can move from prototypes to actionable climate solutions.","Just a few years ago, proposals for zero-emission planes (ZEPs) were regularly attracting headlines for their potential to dramatically reduce global carbon emissions from aviation. But now things are rather different, as the past several months have been filled with setbacks. Let’s consider what this means for efforts by policymakers and the aviation industry to achieve aviation’s target of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050.

The most high-profile setback came when Airbus pushed back its ambitious goal to introduce hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft in 2035. Citing a mix of infrastructure challenges and slower-than-expected technology development, it made the announcement during the Airbus Summit 2025 and expects a 5-10-year delay. Airbus isn’t alone. Other manufacturers have recently dialed back plans or hit financial difficulties. Why this turbulence? Well, as with Airbus, the primary challenges are technology and infrastructure.

Technologically, battery-electric aircraft remain limited to serving short routes (less than 500 km) due to severe battery weight limitations. Jet fuel is still roughly 50 times more energy dense than today’s most advanced lithium battery. While jet fuel contains about 43 MJ/kg of energy, the most advanced lithium-ion batteries today offer only around 0.9–1.0 MJ/kg, making them roughly 40 to 50 times less energy dense by weight. The additional battery weight increases the total mass the aircraft must lift and thus the energy to sustain flight—creating a compounding penalty. Hydrogen technologies such as fuel cells and combustion engines can offer greater range but face their own set of engineering hurdles, particularly concerning the need to develop lighter hydrogen storage tanks and more powerful fuel cells to minimize their significant mass and volume penalty. One of the major aircraft manufacturers, Embraer, recently pushed back its Energia project, a family of low-emission hybrid-electric aircraft, because both battery and hydrogen fuel cell advancements have been slower than hoped. This necessitated the delay of the project from its original intended entry-into-service year of 2035.

Infrastructure is probably an even bigger barrier. Airbus noted that inadequate hydrogen infrastructure—including hydrogen production, distribution, and fueling facilities, airport expansion and modification, and new safety protocols—is one of the major roadblocks to its ZEROe program, the flagship hydrogen-powered aircraft initiative aimed at launching the world’s first commercial ZEP. Indeed, green hydrogen, which is produced using renewable electricity and water electrolysis, comprised less than 1% of global hydrogen production in 2024. And even if green hydrogen were being produced in large volumes, the infrastructure to reliably distribute hydrogen remains sparse and expensive to build. Regulatory frameworks are also lagging, and that’s creating uncertainty and slowing investment. For example, Airbus recently reduced the budget for ZEROe by 25%.

What about the innovative startups we heard about a few years ago? Universal Hydrogen, a U.S.-based company that aimed to decarbonize regional aviation by retrofitting planes to run on hydrogen fuel cells, achieved a remarkable goal when it flew the largest aircraft ever on hydrogen-electric power. However, Universal shut down a year later after failing to secure enough funding to continue research and development. Eviation, an electric-plane startup based in Washington state, paused its Alice program and laid off most of its employees. That these firms struggled to secure the substantial funding and regulatory support necessary to scale is a lesson for the aviation industry: Zero-emission flight requires sustained and coordinated investment and collaboration beyond the reach of individual companies.

What does this all mean for aviation’s climate targets? Well, our recent study found that even with optimistic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and fuel efficiency assumptions, the net-zero carbon target could be exceeded as early as 2037. Therefore, to meet the 2050 net-zero target, accelerating efforts to develop ZEPs seems critical. But with Airbus and others suggesting that 2035 is infeasible, achieving the net-zero target by 2050 looks more difficult than ever.

This puts more pressure on SAF, technical efficiency improvements, and operational optimization to fill the gap. Due in part to this reality, hybrid-electric solutions have emerged as intermediate alternatives because they can be integrated in the medium term and offer moderate emission reductions (even though they are short of climate goals, including when combined with SAFs).

The upcoming update to our Vision 2050 report will reflect the latest industry realities and reassess the role that ZEPs, SAFs, and other mitigation measures must play to realistically meet global targets. It will also feature an updated version of the ICCT’s net-zero aviation roadmap, which for the first time will include the climate impact of non-CO2 emissions.

Ultimately, stakeholders have to ask: Are hydrogen tanks getting lighter? Are fuel cells getting more powerful? Is battery chemistry improving? The recent setbacks are a wake-up call and these indicators will tell us if ZEPs can move from prototypes to actionable climate solutions. Even if there is continued progress on the technology side, the business case will need to be addressed—both the capital and regulatory aspects—to make ZEPs into a reality. In the meantime, as important as ZEPs are to the long-term solution, to stay on track for 2050 it’s likely that policymakers and the aviation industry will have to focus on alternative measures that can deliver medium-term emission savings.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AdobeStock_431775423_scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 06:56:08.015878

Additionally, while airlines can’t begin “engaging with every passenger on the planet,” it’s important to build long-term trust, he suggested.
Stay tuned for Aerospace Global News’ second day of coverage from day two of of the event.","As Sustainable Skies World Summit (SSWS) opened its doors to the industry on day one of the annual event, “climate change is not a choice,” reiterated Jonathan Counsell, group director of sustainability, IAG Group. And buoyed yet again with the underlying imperative that it takes an entire industry’s input to address aviation’s ongoing sustainability challenges, attendees from across the sector – from airlines to fuel producers, innovators and regulators – arrived at Farnborough International for two days of insight and discussion.

Welcoming over 110 speakers across the event, complemented by 36 showcase exhibitors, the elevated number of attendees at the summit was certainly indicative of the scale of the challenge. Now in its fourth iteration, SSWS attendance has risen exponentially from a few hundred attendees in 2022 to some 1,300 plus, explained Counsell, who stressed: “Climate change is not a PR opportunity. And it’s not if we address it, it’s how”.

Certainly, the scope of the global challenge at hand – the decarbonisation of a sector universally acknowledged as ‘hard to abate’ – was not shied away from. Although the UK has halved its carbon emissions since 1990, explained independent advisor the Climate Change Committee (CCC), much work remains to be done. Notably, with around 50% of UK carbon emissions reductions in 2008 attributable to evolving energy supplies, the recommended 7th carbon budget for 2040 (CB7) will require a shift in focus. And despite agricultural and land use set to comprise some 35% alone of this reduction alone, aviation invariably has its part to play, too. By 2040, the CCC’s roadmap projects that SAF will be responsible for some 33% of emissions savings; helping to address what could otherwise become an “existential industry for the industry” – with aviation and agriculture nevertheless set to become the two biggest greenhouse gas emitting sectors by 2040.

As such, the time to start addressing these challenges is now. From pioneering propulsion systems and alternative fuels (such as SAF, electrification and hydrogen) to carbon sequestration, offset strategies, efficiency advancements and clean-sheet aircraft deigns, a thoughtful day of panel discussions and workshops faced the industry’s challenges head-on. Although many ‘pathway to net zero’ roadmaps have been drawn up, “the only thing we can say with any certainty is that all roadmaps are wrong,” mused Anna Stukas, VP of strategic partnerships at carbon capture and storage company 1PointFive. However, with the “building blocks” already in place to effect meaningful change and “leverage strengths”, she urged that “taking small steps is OK” (even if each of these so-called ‘baby steps’ represent significant technological progression and millions, if not billions, of dollars at a time).

And there is ample cause for optimism along the way. Net zero analysis from the UK Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) estimates SAF will play a 25%-30% part in reducing emissions by 2050, with many calling for further government support to solidify revenue certainty mechanisms and bolster production. As Jill Blickstein, chief sustainability officer at American Airlines, succinctly explained: “SAF doesn’t have to be a partisan issue – it’s a growth issue”.

Indeed, over the past 20 years, crude oil has fluctuated from between $0.50 to $4 a gallon, revealed Jan Toshka, CEO of sustainable aviation fuel venture Zaffra highlighted. Amid fears that SAF surcharges may price many people out of flying (with fuel currently accountable for around 25% of the overall ticket price), the industry has still grown, he highlighted. Additionally, while airlines can’t begin “engaging with every passenger on the planet,” it’s important to build long-term trust, he suggested.

While SAF remains the largest widely-accepted lever to accelerate aviation’s short-term decarbonisation efforts, hydrogen’s potential also remains a key factor, with airports such as London Heathrow and Amsterdam Schiphol also highlighting their perspectives on the future of infrastructure decisions. These are “really significant choices and investment decisions,” suggested London Heathrow’s carbon strategy director Matt Gorman, citing sustainability concerns as at the heart of any future expansion plans.

From airports to the types of aircraft themselves- with Germany’s all-electric Vaeridion and the US Otto Aviation’s laminar-flow business jet representing two vastly different aircraft concepts discussed during the day – it seems there is no single solution or lack of innovation on hand. Even airspace modernisation – acknowledged by NATS sustainability, and health and safety director Ian Jopson as a relatively small financial outlay offering huge benefits – has its part to play. Although a moderately small contribution, “we know how do to it,” he suggested, proving that even comparatively small investments could account for up to 5% of the total carbon savings (according to UK Aerospace Technology Institute analysis).

WTTC Urges the Travel & Tourism Industry to Collaborate on Scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel for a Net-Zero FutureIn a landmark move, the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), in partnership with global consultancy ICF, has released a comprehensive new framework urging the global Travel & Tourism sector to unite in tackling one of its most pressing challenges: scaling up the production and adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels.

This call to action comes at a critical time when the sector is striving to meet ambitious net-zero targets and address its significant carbon footprint.

The Challenge: Scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel Supply to Match Demand

Julia Simpson, WTTC President and CEO, highlighted the urgency of addressing the supply-demand imbalance for SAF:

“Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand. If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and stalled climate progress.”

Today, SAF accounts for a mere 0.3% of global jet fuel consumption. To align with net-zero emissions goals by 2050, production needs to increase more than 400-fold — from approximately 1.25 billion litres to over 450 billion litres annually. Achieving this scale will require establishing around 6,500 new renewable fuel plants globally. Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF), which similarly addresses maritime transport emissions, faces analogous production and infrastructure barriers.

Why SAF is a Crucial, Practical Solution

Unlike some decarbonisation options that require new aircraft or engine technologies, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ fuel, meaning it can be used directly in existing engines and infrastructure without modification. This characteristic makes it an attractive and immediate solution for reducing aviation emissions.

However, the challenges of high production costs, limited feedstock availability, and underdeveloped infrastructure have kept SAF production volumes low and prices significantly higher than conventional jet fuel — sometimes up to ten times more expensive. Overcoming these hurdles is essential for broad adoption.

WTTC-ICF Framework: A Blueprint for Sector-Wide Engagement

The new report, Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel, provides a practical roadmap tailored to different types of businesses within the Travel & Tourism ecosystem, including hotels, tour operators, travel agencies, cruise lines, and airlines. It defines clear roles businesses can assume to support SAF growth, categorized as:

Collaborators: Entities that join campaigns, promote sustainable fuels, and share best practices.

Promoters: Those who actively educate stakeholders and customers on sustainable fuel benefits.

Adopters: Companies purchasing SAF or sustainable fuel certificates to reduce their carbon footprint.

Investors: Businesses funding production facilities or infrastructure development to increase SAF availability.

This tiered approach ensures that every organization, regardless of size or resources, can contribute meaningfully to scaling sustainable fuel use.

Insights from Industry Leaders and Case Studies

Daniel Galpin, Managing Director of ICF, emphasized the crucial role of the wider tourism ecosystem in supporting decarbonisation:

“Decarbonising transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector. While transport industries, particularly aviation with its focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), have recognised the importance of sustainable fuels and are courageously working towards a new era, there remains a significant journey ahead.”

Real-world examples underscore progress already underway:

The Erawan Group in Asia is innovatively converting hotel waste oil into SAF, turning waste into a valuable, renewable resource.

Jet2 has invested in a UK-based SAF plant that utilizes recyclable household waste, exemplifying circular economy principles.

These cases demonstrate how different stakeholders across Travel & Tourism can harness innovative solutions to support sustainable fuel production.

Economic and Environmental Imperatives for Scaling SAF

Travel & Tourism is forecasted to generate $16.5 trillion and support over 460 million jobs globally by 2035. The sector’s growth is vital to economies worldwide, but it must proceed sustainably to protect the environment.

Government bodies, such as the UK’s Department for Transport (DfT) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), emphasize the importance of transitioning to renewable fuels to meet climate commitments under the Paris Agreement and national net-zero targets.

The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, part of the EU’s broader “Fit for 55” climate package, mandates increasing SAF use on flights operating in the bloc, illustrating government efforts to regulate and stimulate sustainable fuel uptake (European Commission Aviation).

The Risk of Inaction: Rising Costs and Consumer Impact

The WTTC-ICF report warns that without collective sector action, governments may impose SAF mandates requiring airlines to blend 5% to 10% SAF into jet fuel by 2030.

Without sufficient supply and cooperative engagement from the Travel & Tourism industry, these mandates could lead to increased travel costs and reduced consumer choice, potentially dampening demand and stalling tourism recovery post-pandemic.

Therefore, proactive investment and participation from all tourism businesses are essential to scale supply, reduce costs, and ensure an equitable transition.

Broader Role of Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF)

In addition to aviation, sustainable marine fuels are critical for decarbonizing the cruise and shipping sectors. Like SAF, SMF adoption faces challenges related to feedstock competition, production costs, and infrastructure development. The WTTC encourages the maritime sector within Travel & Tourism to also align with sustainable fuel scaling efforts to achieve holistic industry decarbonisation.

Government and Industry Collaboration: A Key to Success

Governments play a pivotal role in incentivizing SAF production through policy instruments such as tax credits, subsidies, and research funding.

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive set examples of ambitious policies designed to accelerate sustainable fuel market growth.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) advocates for public-private partnerships to bridge investment gaps and create viable supply chains.

Conclusion: A Collective Call to Action

Sustainable fuel represents both an environmental necessity and a business imperative for the Travel & Tourism sector.

WTTC’s new framework highlights that from hotels and tour operators to airlines and cruise lines, every business has a critical role in scaling production and adoption of SAF and SMF.

The path to net-zero emissions requires collaboration, innovation, and strategic investment.

The UK Government has implemented new measures today (14 May 2025) to help the UK become a world leader in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), supporting industry growth and boosting jobs nationwide.

Sustainable aviation fuel is an alternative to fossil jet fuel, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 70% on average on a lifecycle basis. Sustainable fuel is more costly than jet fuel; however, the new measures will protect the industry and consumers from excessive costs.

£400,000 funding to speed up clean fuel production

Decarbonisation is an essential factor in accelerating expansion plans, and to get sustainable aviation fuel to the market quicker, the government has allocated an additional £400,000 in funding to help producers get the fuel on the market quicker. This funding will support testing and qualification of green fuels and follows £63m funding made available through the Advanced Fuels Fund this year.

Additionally, the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) will keep ticket price changes minimal, keeping fluctuations to £1.50 a year on average. It will be industry-funded through a levy for aviation fuel suppliers. The Department for Transport (DfT) will continue to engage with the industry on the details of the RCM, including pricing.

This new commitment to sustainable aviation fuel will help fulfill the government’s mission to deliver economic growth through job creation, making it a clean energy superpower. It will allow the UK to go further and faster with expansion plans, boosting the tourism industry.

Aviation Minister Mike Kane said: “I want to see a golden age for green aviation, and today, we see take-offs for sustainable flights.

Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality, and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.

We are making the UK one of the best places in the world to produce sustainable aviation fuel, putting the pedal down on growth and boosting job opportunities across the country as part of the Plan for Change.”

10% of all jet fuels must be made sustainably

The new measures will help the industry meet its requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year, requiring at least 10% of all jet fuel used in UK flights from 2030 with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

The funding confirms the UK’s commitment to building a homegrown, sustainable fuel production hub. Low-carbon fuels could add up to £5bn to the economy by 2050 and position the UK as a global hub for sustainable aviation fuel production.

Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK, said: “This is a welcome announcement given the importance of the RCM to commercialising and scaling up SAF production in the UK, a technology key to decarbonising aviation by 2050. A UK SAF industry, kick-started by the RCM and SAF Mandate, can create tens of thousands of jobs across the country whilst supporting our world-class aviation sector to deliver economic growth.

We look forward to working with government on scheme design and how contracts are allocated, so that we balance the need to deliver the SAF required to support mandate compliance, whilst keeping costs as low as possible through a competitive and transparent bidding process that places the consumer at its heart.”

Duncan McCourt, Chief Executive of Sustainable Aviation, said: “We hugely welcome the publication of this important legislation. SAF is a crucial element in the plan to decarbonise aviation as it can be used in existing aircraft with existing infrastructure.

The challenge now is to scale the industry, ensuring we have enough SAF to meet the mandate whilst keeping costs low and create thousands of jobs in the process. This legislation will help to do that.”",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iStock-1278067350-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 05:56:12.727687

Building on trials in recent years, this season, 37 biofueled trucks will deliver freight for the events, a renewable and centralised energy system will power the pit and paddock areas, and the F2 and F3 championships will continue to race on 100% advanced sustainable fuel ahead of Formula 1 moving to sustainably fuelled cars in 2026.

READ MORE: 5 crucial milestone moments in F1 safety technology

The 2025 Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix will be the first of the nine European races to use a low carbon energy system across the paddock area, delivering an approximate 90% reduction in associated carbon emissions.

Supplied by Formula 1 partner Aggreko, the rollout to all European events follows successful trials at the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix, and the 2024 Austrian, Hungarian, and Italian Grands Prix, all of which yielded significant carbon reductions in the Paddock, Pit Lane, and Event Technical Centre.

The paddock-wide solution will centralise energy supply into one compound powered by renewable sources, such as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), solar panels, and battery energy storage systems (BESS), and remove the requirement for Formula 1, the 10 F1 teams, and the FIA to use their own generators.

In addition to the carbon reduction through centralised, renewable energy generation, the reduction in on-site generators will also minimise associated transportation emissions.

The return of DHL’s biofuel fleet trucks across the European stint provides Formula 1 with another way to operate more sustainably through the use of alternative fuels.

In 2023, the use of biofuel-powered trucks during the European leg of the season resulted in an average reduction of logistics-related emissions by 83% compared to traditional fuels. This year, DHL will once again use 37 of its trucks to transport freight across Europe.

At the beginning of the season, F2 and F3 cars successfully made the move to Aramco’s 100% advanced sustainable fuel, following the use of 55% sustainable fuel last season. This move comes ahead of the Formula 1 cars adopting the fuels in 2026 in the new hybrid engines that will take to the circuit next year.

The move to 100% advanced sustainable fuels is an instrumental part of the sport’s alternative fuel strategy, as well as having a wider impact in the automotive industry, as the fuel developed by Formula 1 will be a ‘drop-in’ and can be used in road cars without modification, serving as a sustainable alternative of global benefit.

Formula 1’s alternative fuel strategy is a pivotal part of how the sport continues to reduce carbon emissions today. Last year, Formula 1 made significant investments in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), delivering an estimated 80% reduction in associated carbon emissions per flight compared to the use of conventional aviation fuel.

The combined investment in SAF with Global Partners DHL and Qatar Airways reduced total related emissions by more than 8,000 tCO2e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent), an approximate 19% reduction in related emissions compared to traditional aviation fuel across the flyaway events of the 2024 season.

Did you know that leftover cooking oil can help power an A380 engine? Let me explain. Sustainable aviation fuel, or safe for short, is an alternative to traditional jet fuel. But how is it made? SAF, unlike traditional jet fuel, isn't derived from fossil sources. It's made from feedstock like agricultural waste, sugar cane byproducts, and even algae to produce SAP. Feed stocks are refined through chemical processing, then tested and certified to make sure that the end product meets all the performance, safety, and certification requirements of traditional jet fuel. The SAF is then blended with traditional jet fuel and drop straight. Some existing fueling infrastructure. Aviation is a hard to abate sector, which means there aren't many readily available solutions to help us reach our emissions targets. SAF is currently the single biggest lever we have to reduce aviation emissions. And today, alongside Sydney Airport, AMPOL and supported by our S Coalition made-up of leading Australian and international organisations, we're marking the largest ever commercial importation of SAF into Australia, with nearly 2,000,000 litres arriving this week. We've already begun taking steps to help us. Published a domestic sustainable aviation fuel industry in Australia which has the potential to not only lower emissions but create thousands of jobs across Australia and increase national fuel security.

The demonstration aimed to prove that the electric Tri-Converter can continuously produce syngas at increasing scales, using a blend of real-world feedstocks including biogenic CO₂, renewable natural gas (RNG) and green hydrogen.

This project forms part of Aether’s initiative to build and operate a fully integrated demonstration plant capable of producing more than one barrel of sustainable fuel per day. Construction of the plant is expected to be completed later this year.

Drawing from the science of leadership and the timeless lessons of musical legends, here are seven powerful ways leaders can transform their teams into high-performing ensembles.
Leadership takeaway: In today’s hyper-distracted workplaces, attention has become the new competitive advantage.
Like great musicians, great leaders don’t scatter their energy; they channel it.
Leadership takeaway: Excellence doesn’t happen by accident; it’s engineered.","In business, as in music, true mastery isn’t about striving for mechanical perfection but resonance, rhythm and trust.

Before I became a business strategist and certified neuroleadership coach, I was a professional bassist, trained in classical and jazz performance. What I learned on the concert stage about collaboration, adaptation and peak performance now informs everything I teach leaders about orchestrating high-performing teams.

Today, neuroscience confirms what great musicians have always known: peak team performance is a synchronized act of emotional connection, cognitive agility and intentional practice. Research published in Harvard Business Review shows that teams with strong emotional bonds and psychological safety outperform others by as much as 27% on complex tasks. Similarly, a study in Frontiers in Psychology found that musical ensembles’ ability to synchronize with each other relies on shared mental models — a principle equally vital for organizational success.

Drawing from the science of leadership and the timeless lessons of musical legends, here are seven powerful ways leaders can transform their teams into high-performing ensembles.

1. Practice like Prince: Focus is a superpower

Prince was more than a talented performer — he was a perfectionist of craft. He mastered dozens of instruments, choreographed his shows and oversaw production. His obsessive focus wasn’t accidental; it was a practiced discipline.

Leadership takeaway: In today’s hyper-distracted workplaces, attention has become the new competitive advantage. According to Harvard Business Review, multitasking can reduce productivity by as much as 40%. Leaders who try to juggle everything dilute their impact.

What to do:

Create a daily “focus setlist” identifying your top three critical priorities.

Schedule uninterrupted blocks (at least 90 minutes) for strategic thinking.

Protect these blocks like sound checks before a concert — non-negotiable.

Like great musicians, great leaders don’t scatter their energy; they channel it.

2. Lead like Beyoncé: Excellence is in the details

Beyoncé’s legendary performances are the result of rigorous preparation. Every lighting cue, costume change and note is meticulously rehearsed. Yet what’s extraordinary is how her teams — backup dancers, musicians and crew reflect that same standard of excellence.

Leadership takeaway: Excellence doesn’t happen by accident; it’s engineered. A 2022 Gallup study showed that teams with clear goals and expectations outperform others by 20% in productivity and profitability.

What to do:

Set crystal-clear expectations for every project — objectives, roles and outcomes.

Prepare for critical meetings like Beyoncé preps for tour rehearsals: anticipate questions, align stakeholders and create backup plans.

Role-play difficult conversations with a coach or trusted colleague to fine-tune delivery.

Small details, rehearsed consistently, make the difference between a good performance and a standing ovation.

3. Improvise like Coltrane: Make space for innovation

John Coltrane’s improvisations weren’t chaotic — they were intentional explorations built atop the deep musical structure. Improvisation at its best is a profound act of listening, adapting and creating in real-time.

Leadership takeaway: In fast-paced industries, innovation doesn’t come from rigid planning—it comes from adaptive collaboration. Google’s Project Aristotle identified psychological safety and open idea-sharing as the top predictors of team success.

What to do:

Schedule “improv jams” once a month — open sessions where teams brainstorm ideas without judgment.

Rotate facilitators to avoid hierarchy dominating the room.

Celebrate wild ideas; iteration often comes after exploration.

When leaders create structured spaces for spontaneity, they unleash hidden creativity within their teams.

4. Collaborate like The Beatles: Harmony beats hierarchy

The Beatles weren’t just a collection of solo stars but a system of mutual amplification. Paul’s basslines supported John’s lyrics. Ringo’s drums filled George’s guitar riffs. Their magic came from synergy, not ego.

Leadership takeaway: Diversity of strengths fuels innovation — but only when collaboration is nurtured. McKinsey’s research shows that diverse teams are 35% more likely to outperform their peers in profitability, but only when there is intentional collaboration.

What to do:

Break down departmental silos with regular cross-functional “sectionals” short, problem-solving huddles across departments.

Assign team goals that can only be achieved through cross-unit collaboration.

Recognize and reward collaboration as much as individual achievement.

Harmony beats hierarchy every time — and the music you create together will be richer for it.

5. Reinvent like David Bowie: Stay relevant by evolving

David Bowie wasn’t afraid to evolve artistically or personally. He shifted personas, genres and styles while remaining undeniably himself. Reinvention wasn’t about abandoning identity but growing into new possibilities.

Leadership takeaway: Today’s world demands reinvention. The World Economic Forum predicts that 50% of all employees will need reskilling by 2025 to meet changing job requirements.

What to do:

Host quarterly “Retire, Refresh, Reimagine” workshops with your team.

Ask: What practices are outdated? What strengths should we amplify? What innovations should we chase?

Encourage career pathing and lateral moves that build skills outside narrow job roles.

Leaders who embrace reinvention model adaptability — and their teams follow suit.

6. Play the long game like Billie Eilish: Vulnerability builds trust

Billie Eilish broke into global fame by doing the unthinkable: leading with vulnerability. She ditched pop’s traditional polish for raw honesty — and millions resonated.

Leadership takeaway: Vulnerability isn’t weakness; it’s a catalyst for trust. According to research in Harvard Business Review, leaders who model vulnerability increase team learning behaviors and engagement by up to 30%.

What to do:

In team retrospectives, openly share lessons from mistakes or missteps.

Invite feedback about your leadership style — and act on it visibly.

Celebrate vulnerability in others: highlight when a team member shares a hard truth or admits a mistake.

When leaders are brave enough to be human, their teams become brave enough to innovate.

7. Think like an orchestra: Culture is the bass, strategy is the drums

The rhythm section — the bass and drums — sets the tone in any great band or orchestra. If the rhythm falters, no amount of brilliant solos can save the performance.

Leadership takeaway: Strategy (the plan) and culture (the human connection) must cohere. According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), toxic workplace cultures cost US businesses over $223 billion in turnover over five years.

What to do:

Conduct quarterly “culture check-ins” with your team.

Regularly assess whether strategy and culture are aligned, and course correct if not.

Remember: If the culture feels offbeat, even the best strategy will eventually collapse.

When strategy keeps tempo and culture provides groove, your team will not just deliver projects — they’ll deliver performances.

Build your leadership symphony

High-performing teams don’t happen by accident. They are composed, rehearsed and fine-tuned over time. As a leader, you’re not simply managing projects but orchestrating energy, emotion and execution.

Your team occasionally hits the wrong notes, like a great band or symphony. But if you keep the rhythm strong, foster trust, encourage creativity and lead authentically, you’ll create performances — and business outcomes — that stand the test of time.

So ask yourself: What music are you making with your team? And is it something worth listening to, growing with and celebrating every day?

The agreement was reached during a BRICS Transport Working Group meeting held in Brasilia, as Brazil holds the rotating presidency of the bloc.

The declaration includes commitments to decarbonization, sustainable fuels and modal integration, while rejecting unilateral restrictions that could hinder access to essential technologies.

A key proposal is the creation of a BRICS Institute for Sustainable Transport, Mobility, and Logistics to promote best practices and climate-resilient infrastructure planning.

""This marks the first ministerial declaration focused solely on transport,"" said acting Ports and Airports Minister of Brazil Mariana Pescatori. ""It allows us to align strategic interests and promote sustainable solutions.""

Ministers at the meeting also pledged to expand cooperation on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), aiming to meet climate targets under the International Civil Aviation Organization. Brazil has already set national targets for SAF use, starting with 1 percent in 2027 and rising to 10 percent by 2037.

The bloc compiled a compendium of national initiatives to decarbonize ports and maritime transport, including electrification and infrastructure adaptation.

Other commitments include enhancing air connectivity among BRICS countries and exploring a new multilateral aviation mechanism.

Azure Sustainable Fuels Corp. is working in partnership with Tk’emlúps te Secwepemc to make the project a reality.

The facility would convert agricultural feedstocks, mainly canola, into Sustainable Aviation Fuel using a process called the Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids process.

The technology has been in commercial use and in operations for several years in many facilities around the world, including facilities in North America, Azure said in a written statement sent to iNFOnews.ca. The company is exploring multiple sites including Manitoba, Ontario and Kansas but they don't have any facilities in operation.

Already used by several airlines, the sustainable aviation fuel is approved for blending up to 50% with conventional jet fuel. In contrast to fossil fuels, the renewable fuel results in fewer carbon dioxide emissions.

In December 2024, a company called Parklands became the first in Canada to produce low carbon aviation fuel at its Burnaby Refinery, producing more than 100,000 litres that was purchased by Air Canada, according to Parkland's website.

The Azure plant is one part of the 7Mile District development project by Tk’emlúps te Secwepemc, that aims to turn a section of the reservation into an industrial park on one side and a solar powered agricultural area on the other.

The land sits between Highway 5 and the North Thompson River, and is divided in half by the CN rail yard.

The jet fuel plant would be built on a 71-hectare heavy industrial section and include storage tanks for feedstocks and products, process units for fuel production and utilities to support process units. According to the 7Mile District Master Plan, Azure is proposing to minimize the use of fossil fuels as an energy source for process operations, and use the train to transport feedstock.

The facility would produce roughly 20,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel, or up to 1 billion litres per year, providing for the reduction of up to 2,600,000 tonnes of CO2 annually, the master plan said. If the heavy industrial use plan proves to be unfeasible, either another industrial anchor might be chosen or a more locally focused, multi-business industrial park model built instead.

British Columbia has set a renewable fuel target for jet fuel at 1% starting in 2028 and increasing to 3% in 2030. Several countries around the world, including the United Kingdom and the European Union have set targets for minimum amount of sustainable aviation fuel requirements ranging from 2% in 2025 up to 70% in 2050, according to Azure.

The 7Mile Renewable Fuels Facility is currently undergoing community engagement, and regulatory and environmental review, and a final investment decision is expected in 2026.

Panelists at an American Medical Association webinar explored the challenges rural IPs face and the resources that can help them keep patients and health care workers safe.

Challenges around infection prevention training

A focus group led by Drs. Ylinne Lynch and Liza Rosenman of the Teaching Infection Prevention through Simulation team at the University of Washington found that many infection preventionists “fell” into the role due to administrative reasons and have a broad range of backgrounds, which can be a benefit. But they didn’t have the tools they needed to be successful. Some reported having to learn on the job, often with little institutional support, leaving them feeling overwhelmed.

Moreover, they reported difficulties getting infection prevention education to appropriate teams, due to misinformation, staff turnover or competing demands. Regardless, they have empathy for clinicians, understanding they face competing priorities, with one participant noting that clinicians are “just trying to get through caring for someone with a higher ratio than normal, and you’re trying to talk about hand hygiene.”

A separate assessment by infection preventionists and registered nurses Lauren Musil and Alisha Sheffield of the University of Nebraska Medical Center found similar challenges. More than 60% of infection preventionists said that they had infection prevention and control training, but only 44% felt it was adequate. On top of that, many have multiple roles, making it difficult to effectively do their job. However, infection preventionists report more job satisfaction if they have the support of hospital leadership, Musil said.

Lynch also touched on that. “I think what’s really hard about [infection prevention and control] is that when it’s done really well, the value’s a little bit invisible,” she said. “You can’t really easily measure the HAIs that are prevented.”

Resources for infection preventionists

The TIPS focus groups found that infection preventionists want more resources to support their efforts. Some participants noted that they needed to create culturally relevant materials or otherwise needed additional guidance to bolster and improve their infection prevention programs.

The IPC Support Center, described by Musil, aims to support such programs by providing tools for IPC education and practice. The center’s Self-led Infection Control Evaluation, or SLICE, tool allows rural and critical access acute care facilities to perform a self-evaluation of their infection prevention programs to identify areas for opportunity. Domains involve environmental cleaning, injection safety and critical device reprocessing, among others, providing resources and immediate summary reports. The center’s “Behind the Mask” webinar series corresponds to the SLICE tool, providing a way to ”reach hundreds of IPs instead of just one IP at a time to answer” pressing questions, Sheffield added.

Other resources within the IPC Support Center include the Extended Reality Education Program, created specifically for sterile processing workflows, giving users the opportunity to become familiar with them before stepping into a processing space. IPs can take advantage of the training by using a headset for an immersive experience, or through a laptop or tablet. The center also has a growing resource repository that includes checklists, audit forms and templates.

Local support

Another resource for IPs is their local Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology chapter, where they can connect with other professionals who have similar questions, Sheffield said. Local and state public health departments, as well as health care coalitions, also are resources that IPs can tap in to, and Musil noted that some departments offer office hours specifically for IPs, as well as webinars and infection prevention courses.

Sheffield had more advice for IPs in rural areas: Cold call IP professionals at other facilities to network and collaborate. She added that she has found success by putting herself out there and connecting with others in the field.

Results from the TIPS focus group support the idea of formal and informal networking. Participating IPs said they have shadowed IPs at other facilities and networked to learn how other professionals do their jobs and what worked for them, while others leaned on conferences, webinars and APIC resources.

“There’s lots of support within this community. Everybody’s rooting for one another,” Sheffield said.",https://www.smartbrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/infection-prevention-e1747245188960.png,N,,2025-05-14 21:56:12.754276

It is estimated that roughly 40% of the world's potential SAF feedstock will come from Asia-Pacific, particularly Southeast Asia.
Southeast Asia could produce 26 million tonnes of SAF per year, of which 5 million tonnes would come from Thailand, she said.
Energy conglomerates Bangchak and PTT Global Chemical have already begun SAF production.
SAF comprises less than 1% of global aviation fuel used today, but it should reach 6% by 2030, she said.","Airbus is banking on Southeast Asia becoming the world's top producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), while the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) plans to mandate 1% SAF usage for European routes starting in the fourth quarter.

Julie Kitcher, chief sustainability officer at Airbus, said with SAF key to achieving its net-zero goal by 2050, she is optimistic about Thailand's prospects of becoming a global SAF producer and supplier.

SAF, also known as biofuel for aircraft, is a liquid fuel made of feedstock that can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% across the lifecycle, from production to usage.

It is estimated that roughly 40% of the world's potential SAF feedstock will come from Asia-Pacific, particularly Southeast Asia.

Southeast Asia could produce 26 million tonnes of SAF per year, of which 5 million tonnes would come from Thailand, she said.

Ms Kitcher said Thailand already has a strong agricultural sector with extensive feedstocks such as molasses, rice straw and rice husks.

Energy conglomerates Bangchak and PTT Global Chemical have already begun SAF production.

The decreased demand for bioethanol in Thai road transport due to the uptick in electric vehicles could free up space in production plants to produce more SAF, she said.

Ms Kitcher said Thailand's challenge is developing an in-depth feasibility study for different types of feedstocks, its location, accessibility as well as collection and transport costs.

In Thailand, the aviation sector contributed more than 7% of GDP before the pandemic, as more than 80% of inbound tourists arrived by air.

SAF comprises less than 1% of global aviation fuel used today, but it should reach 6% by 2030, she said.

The fuel costs 3-5 times more than kerosene, as it requires more investment in new projects to help reduce prices.

Ms Kitcher said policymakers should create schemes to help assure revenue for producers, which could help sustain the growth of SAF production, allowing them to confidently plan production 5-7 years ahead.

Airbus jets can be powered by up to 50% SAF blending and the company is also developing new aircraft to adopt a 100% SAF blend by 2030, she said.

ACM Manat Chavanaprayoon, director-general of the CAAT, said the authority is now in the final stage of gathering feedback in order to announce a regulation mandating SAF usage by Thai carriers, which should minimise the impact for airlines and passengers, and be ready by the end of this year.

Mr Manat said it plans to start with mandating a 1% SAF blend, as SAF today costs over three times more than jet A-1 fuel.

The 1% usage should not significantly affect airfares and would allow the CAAT to study its impact during the initial phase, he said.

This measure might be introduced on European routes first since the EU already mandated using a 2% blend of SAF at their airports and penalising airlines who fail to meet SAF blending requirements.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2025/05/14/5605196_700.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 19:56:47.253492

The draft legislation amends and extends the 45Z clean fuel production credit but repeals several other clean energy tax credits.
The existing 45Z tax credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provides a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels.
“The SAF Coalition is grateful to the Ways & Means Committee for supporting the extension of the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) through 2031,” Graab continued.
“The American Biogas Council applauds the House Ways and Means Committee for extending the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit in its reconciliation bill,” said Patrick Serfass, executive director of the ABC.","The House Ways and Means Committee on May 14 advanced its portion of President Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax bill. The draft legislation amends and extends the 45Z clean fuel production credit but repeals several other clean energy tax credits.

The existing 45Z tax credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provides a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels. The credit starts at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit is up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. The tax credit is currently in place for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

Section 111112 of the draft legislation aims to limit availability of the 45Z credit to fuels produced from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S. It also aims to exclude indirect land use change (ILUC) from being used to calculate the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of eligible fuel and directs the U.S. Treasury Department to establish distinct emissions rates for specific manure feedstocks.

The draft bill would extend the 45Z credit through Dec. 31, 2031. Additional changes to the 45Z credit aim to eliminate transferability of the credit for fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2027, and restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.

The draft bill leaves the 45Q credit for carbon sequestration largely intact but aims to enact restrictions on transferability. Specifically, the legislation would repeal transferability for carbon capture equipment where construction begins two years after the bill’s date of enactment. It also restricts access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.

While the draft bill updates and extends the 45Z tax credit and leaves the 45Q credit mostly unchanged, it also aims to repeal and scale back numerous other clean energy tax credits, including the clean hydrogen tax credit and the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit.

The alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for advanced refueling property placed in service during a give tax year, including property used to dispense E85, biodiesel blends of B20 or greater, natural gas, hydrogen, propane, and electricity. The credit value is 30% of the cost of the property, up to $100,000. The credit is currently scheduled to retire on Dec. 31, 2032. The draft bill would accelerate the sunset date of the credit to Dec. 31, 2025.

The bill also aims to terminate the clean hydrogen production tax credit, which was established by the IRA and allows taxpayers to claim a credit per kilogram of qualified clean hydrogen produced for sale or use. The credit is based on GHG emission ate of the production process, with a value of up to 60 cents per kilogram. The clean hydrogen tax credit is currently available for facilities that commence construction before Jan. 1, 2033. The draft bill would accelerate the expiration of the credit to facilities the construction of which begins after Dec. 32, 2025.

Another section of the draft bill aims to phase-out a credit that supports the installation of residential wood heating appliances. The legislation would terminate the energy efficient home improvement credit, which currently allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for household energy efficiency improvements. The value of the credit is 30% of qualified expenses, up to $1,200 annually, or $2,000 for heat pumps and biomass stoves. The credit is currently set to expire on Dec. 31, 2032. The draft bill would accelerate the expiration to Dec. 31, 2025.

In addition, the draft bill seeks to phase out the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) for clean electricity. The credits are not currently set to expire. The draft bill, however, aims to phase out the credit by reducing the value of the credit by 20% for facilities placed into service after 2029, by 40% for facilities placed into service in 2030, and 60% for facilities placed into service 2031. No credit would be available for facilities placed into service after 2031. Bill provisions also eliminate transferability of the credit and restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAC) Coalition has spoken out in support of the bill’s 45Z provisions. “Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a key solution for strengthening U.S. energy dominance, driving investment in rural economies and positioning the United States as a global leader in SAF production,” said Alison Graab, executive director of the SAF Coalition.

“The SAF Coalition is grateful to the Ways & Means Committee for supporting the extension of the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) through 2031,” Graab continued. “This critical legislation provides long-term certainty for SAF producers, incentivizes private sector investment, and builds out a robust domestic supply chain. The bill ensures that 45Z delivers direct benefits to U.S. farmers and rural economies.

“We urge Congress to pass this extension to reinforce our energy dominance and unleash the full economic potential of America’s heartland.”

The American Biogas Council is also applauding extension of the 45Z credit. “The American Biogas Council applauds the House Ways and Means Committee for extending the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit in its reconciliation bill,” said Patrick Serfass, executive director of the ABC. “This is a critical step toward supporting reliable renewable fuels like biogas that reduce air and water pollution, create American-made energy, and drive rural economic development. The extension of 45Z ensures continued momentum for investment in biogas systems that turn organic waste into clean energy—benefiting communities, farmers, and rural economies.”

Brian Jennings with the American Coalition for Ethanol tells Brownfield the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements that were tied to most of the Biden era tax credits including 45Z are not feasible. “Potentially, include either an improvement to that prevailing wage and apprenticeship language or eliminating that requirement alltogether. That’s a conversation we’ll be having with the House and with the Senate.”

Geoff Cooper with the Renewable Fuels Association agrees and says he would also like to see the transferability of the credit go beyond 2027 to help smaller producers. He says the bill also doesn’t allow ethanol producers to benefit from conservation practices on the farm as part of the carbon intensity scoring. “And therefore, there’s really no way for ethanol producers to reward farmers for those practices through the existing structure of this tax credit.”

Cooper is hoping these issues can be addressed in the House Budget Committee or in the Senate before the bill is finalized.

Jennings says if the 45Z tax credits are available, ethanol companies are ready to innovate and take advantage of them, but he wonders if the value of the credit will be enough to get sustainable aviation fuel production off the ground because of the extra refinement needed.

The 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit is one of the few tax policies House Republicans kept from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. As written, the credit would extend to 2031.

On 1 January 2025, the UK’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate came into force, which requires the flight sector to supplant 2% of its jet fuel demand with SAF in flights taking off from the UK from 2025.

It also announced an additional £400,000 to enable SAF producers to get new clean fuels to market quicker.
It follows £63m allocated through the Advanced Fuels Fund in January 2025 to support UK SAF production.","The Department for Transport (DfT) has announced measures to support green aviation fuel producers, including a revenue certainty scheme and an additional £400,000 in funding.

On 1 January 2025, the UK’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate came into force, which requires the flight sector to supplant 2% of its jet fuel demand with SAF in flights taking off from the UK from 2025. This will grow year-on-year to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

Made from sustainable sources, including materials such as household waste or used cooking oil, SAF is considered a major tool in helping to lower climate change emissions from air travel – widely regarded as one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise.

SAF can be used in existing aircraft, and it emits on average 70% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than using fossil jet fuel on a life-cycle basis.

A recent study found that emissions from European airlines have soared to pre-Covid-19 levels .

However, a key challenge for airlines meeting this mandate and using SAF in their aircraft is that there is simply not enough of it. Lufthansa and British Airways have already said that switching to cleaner, more expensive sustainable fuel will drive up ticket prices . Air New Zealand also announced it is dropping its 2030 goal to cut carbon emissions because of difficulties in procuring new planes and SAF.

Aware of the challenge of scaling SAF production to meet the mandate while keeping costs low, the government said in January that it would introduce a revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) for SAF producers to attract investment in new plants in the UK.

This RCM has now been introduced in parliament. The DfT said this RCM will keep ticket price changes minimal – a fluctuation of around £1.50 a year – and will be industry-funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers.

The DfT said it will continue to engage with industry on the details of the RCM, including pricing.

It also announced an additional £400,000 to enable SAF producers to get new clean fuels to market quicker. This funding will be used to support the testing and qualification of these green fuels.

It follows £63m allocated through the Advanced Fuels Fund in January 2025 to support UK SAF production.

Mike Kane, aviation minister, said: “Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality – and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.”

Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said: “We look forward to working with government on scheme design and how contracts are allocated, so that we balance the need to deliver the SAF required to support mandate compliance, whilst keeping costs as low as possible through a competitive and transparent bidding process that places the consumer at its heart.”

While the government wants the UK to be a global hub for SAF production, there is concern about where the feedstocks for this production will come from. In 2023, a study by the Royal Society found that the transition to SAF would require the use of 50% of the UK's agricultural land .

Meanwhile, some aircraft producers are working on other means of decarbonising aviation. In March 2025, Airbus said its dedication to hydrogen-powered flight remains “unwavering” .",https://eandt.theiet.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2025-05/web_refueling-airplane-airport-ground-service-before_Credit_Jaromir-Chalabala_shutterstock_2191982235_1600x900.png?itok=EVVeuaZO,N,,2025-05-14 15:57:56.117853

Yet to meet net-zero goals by 2050, production must increase to over 450 billion liters, with an estimated 6,500 new renewable fuel plants around the world.
The report encourages joining campaigns to foster greater awareness, funding production facilities as an investor, purchasing sustainable fuel certifications or supplying waste products for the production of SAF.
For example, The Erawan Group provides its used hotel oil to be recycled into SAF in Asia.
""Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand,” said Julia Simpson, WTTC President & CEO.","The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) is urging the travel industry to increase production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other more renewable forms of power in a new report entitled, “Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel.”

The report, created in partnership with global consultancy ICF, provides ways for how every business within the travel industry can address emissions and help hasten the shift towards more sustainable options, whether they be a collaborator, promoter, adopter or investor.

Currently, SAF comprises only 0.3 percent of global jet fuel use, with production at 1.25 billion liters. Yet to meet net-zero goals by 2050, production must increase to over 450 billion liters, with an estimated 6,500 new renewable fuel plants around the world.

There are challenges to scaling up SAF, though. Production costs are high due to limited infrastructure and competition.

The report encourages joining campaigns to foster greater awareness, funding production facilities as an investor, purchasing sustainable fuel certifications or supplying waste products for the production of SAF. For example, The Erawan Group provides its used hotel oil to be recycled into SAF in Asia.

""Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand,” said Julia Simpson, WTTC President & CEO. “If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and stalled climate progress.”

“Every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play,” she continued. “This framework gives them the blueprint. Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity; it’s a business imperative and governments must incentivise the production of SAF, not just set targets for the sector.”

But on the whole, there’s still much to look forward to in terms of private aviation.","After a stunning increase in demand due to the global coronavirus pandemic, private aviation has remained relatively stable amid uncertain economic times. Though stumbling blocks remain, on the bright side, the industry has seen continued innovation in terms of sustainability initiatives. For a deeper look ahead, we tapped multiple aviation experts for an exploration of private aviation trends and challenges for 2025 and beyond.

Doug Gollan is president and founder of Private Jet Card Comparisons, a data-based buyers guide to jet cards, memberships and fractional ownership programs. He notes, “The industry enters 2025 coming off its third-best year ever in terms of flying with a strong end-of-year surge. Private Jet Card Comparisons subscribers project they will fly 42.7 hours in the next 12 months, up from 42.4 hours the year before. What’s more, 95.4 percent of the consumers who started flying since the Covid pandemic have stayed with private aviation, demonstrating that it’s a product customers like, and once they try it on a regular basis, come back for more.”

Jamie Walker, Chairman of Jet Linx, states, “the industry has found new footing after the seesaw of demand and rising costs from previous years.” Gregg Brunson-Pitts, founder and CEO of Advanced Aviation Team, continues, “Private aviation is thriving as more individuals and businesses recognize the value of flexible, time-saving travel solutions. While demand has leveled off after the post-pandemic surge, our clients today are more sophisticated and selective, placing a higher premium on comfort, personalization and overall experience. It’s no longer just about getting from point A to point B—it’s about creating a seamless, luxury journey that caters to every detail, from ground services to in-flight amenities.”

David McCown, president of the Americas for global aircraft charter specialist Chapman Freeborn, adds, “While globally, the outlook is varied, in the US the trend is clearly positive. In the charter market, we see growing year-over-year demand . . . January year-over-year departures for Chapman Freeborn in the US are trending above industry, up over 20 percent, and we see solid trip requests for future travel even into the summer months.”

Sustainability at the Forefront

As with travel as a whole, sustainability is a key trend to focus on moving ahead. “The continued rollout of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is likely the biggest thing to watch in 2025 due to the progress made last year. There is a lot of positive momentum to continue pushing this important initiative to the forefront,” shares Walker of Jet Linx. Brunson-Pitts agrees, adding, “Sustainability remains front and center, with more clients asking about carbon offsets and sustainable aviation fuel, which is becoming more widely available, including at key airports like Teterboro (TEB) and Washington Dulles (IAD).” He says, “Operators and FBOs are steadily integrating greener solutions into their operations, and the industry is moving toward a future where sustainability isn’t just a luxury—it’s the new standard.”

McCown shares, “Regarding sustainability, the US withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement should not hinder aviation’s progress towards a sustainable future. Many Global (non-US) companies who [operate] within the US still have emissions reduction targets to meet which will require the same amount of focus from US-based operators and businesses.” According to McCown, this includes advancing alternative aviation fuel production, using sustainable fuels and developing aircraft and engines compatible with these initiatives. “Globally, the industry’s push for emission reductions should drive innovation, create value and generate employment opportunities both in the US and worldwide,” he says.

Gollan notes that in his experience, it’s the industry advancing the sustainable initiative rather than the consumer. “While sustainability continues to be a major push from the industry side, only 29.2 percent of Private Jet Card Comparisons subscribers say these programs will factor into the next time they choose a provider, so from a consumer point of view, changes to program policies and rules will continue to be the most important factors,” he explains.

Popular Aircraft

In terms of what private aviation travelers want for 2025 and beyond, there’s lots to report. “We’re seeing increased demand for larger cabin aircraft, particularly for longer international trips. Clients are prioritizing space and comfort, with a focus on the ability to work, relax and connect with family or colleagues seamlessly while in the air,” says Brunson-Pitts. He adds, “At the same time, new aircraft like the Gulfstream G700 are entering the market, creating a ripple effect on the availability of older-generation jets like the G650 and G550. Looking ahead, the expected certification of the Bombardier Global 8000 this year and the Falcon 10X in 2027 will further expand options for travelers seeking the latest in performance and luxury.”

Jet Linx data post pandemic shows the same trend. “From 2020 to 2025, we’ve seen light jet flights drop by 22 percent, while super midsize grew by 41 percent and heavy jet grew by 184 percent. Midsize jet flights have remained flat. International flights grew by a combined 76 percent across all size categories since 2020,” Walker shares.

Gollan notes that for fractional ownership and jet card users, it’s often about being able to stand up in the plane’s cabin if you are tall. “There is a lot of interest in seeing a dedicated Praetor 500 card to cover the midsize segment—but to this point, we’re still waiting. Challenger 300 series is very popular for the super-midsize segment. Both cabins are six feet high,” the Private Jet Card Comparison founder shares.

Chapman Freeborn’s McCown states, “we are seeing a demand trend towards newer aircraft, in part due to the perception that they are safer [and] more reliable (incurring fewer mechanicals).” He also notes that customers are increasingly looking for larger business aircraft, even for shorter trips, sharing that, “Phenom 300s are a favorite, and Citation Latitudes/Longitudes and Embraer Praetors are becoming increasingly popular.”

Challenges

As is true almost across the board, rising costs continue to affect the private aviation industry. These higher costs have pushed a segment of users out of the marketplace, according to Walker. “Therefore, demand isn’t as robust as it should be with a growing economy and the bull market results of 2024,” he concludes. “Going into 2025, the industry will continue to consolidate due to the challenges of higher costs, a shortage of talent and soft demand. These challenges are compounded for the smaller companies who haven’t yet reached the economies of scale needed to weather the current marketplace,” Walker explains. “New technology will continue to help the industry find greater efficiencies, but not at a rate quick enough to improve earnings or lower costs for the end users,” he adds.

Gollan points to supply chain interruption as another core issue facing private aviation today. “This has made it more difficult for operators, particularly regarding older aircraft where there are still shortages of parts, which means aircraft are on the ground longer. With pricing stabilizing, operators will also see margins squeezed as they deal with increased costs from pilot and general wages to various fees,” he says.

But on the whole, there’s still much to look forward to in terms of private aviation. “Our industry continues to evolve to meet the needs of a more diverse client base. While business and corporate travel remain a core driver, particularly for privacy and security purposes, we’re seeing more families and individuals choosing private jets for leisure travel—whether to explore remote destinations that are hard to reach or to avoid the unpredictability of commercial air travel,” shares Brunson-Pitts. “It’s ultimately about creating an experience that prioritizes convenience, safety and time efficiency,”",https://www.jetsetmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Falcon10X_GAL_212_202302.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 15:58:06.398658

There are currently seven approved pathways for producing SAF, with an eighth — eSAF — emerging as a key long-term solution:

HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids)

Produced from waste oils and fats. Commercially established, easy to scale, and can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel.

Fischer-Tropsch (FT-SPK)

Converts solid biomass or waste into syngas, which is then converted into fuel. Technically proven but capital-intensive and best suited for large-scale infrastructure.

Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ)

Converts ethanol or isobutanol (from sugars or waste) into jet fuel. Suitable for regions with abundant agricultural feedstocks. Approved for blending up to 50%.

CHJ (Catalytic Hydrothermolysis Jet)

Processes lipids through hydrothermal upgrading. Certified and under active development.

HFS-SIP (Fermented Sugars to Iso-Paraffins)

Uses engineered yeast to convert sugars into jet fuel. Approved but limited to 10% blending due to fuel composition.

FT-SPK/A

A Fischer-Tropsch variant that includes aromatics to better match jet fuel standards. Recently certified.

HC-HEFA

Derived from algae and other novel lipid sources.

eSAF

Emerging as a long-term solution, electrofuels such as eKerosene are produced using renewable electricity to generate hydrogen, which is then combined with captured CO₂ to create a sustainable, carbon-neutral fuel.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) refers to a range of bio-based and synthetic fuels that reduce carbon emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. SAF can be produced through various pathways, such as HEFA, Fischer-Tropsch, or Alcohol-to-Jet.

eSAF (electrofuels) is a subset of SAF produced using renewable electricity, typically by combining captured CO₂ with renewable hydrogen to create synthetic fuels like eKerosene. eSAF is considered a long-term, scalable solution for the aviation sector, offering an additional route to decarbonization that relies on renewable energy and carbon capture technologies.

eKerosene is considered sustainable because it is produced using renewable hydrogen and captured CO₂, making it a carbon-neutral fuel. The production of eKerosene significantly reduces lifecycle emissions compared to conventional jet fuel, which helps meet global net-zero targets. As a drop-in fuel, eKerosene can be blended with existing jet fuel, allowing the aviation sector to reduce its carbon footprint while continuing normal operations without the need for major infrastructure changes. Furthermore, eKerosene supports the transition to sustainable aviation by offering a renewable alternative that can scale with the growing demand for low-emission fuels.

The Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ) process is a two-step method used to produce eKerosene. In the first step, eMethanol is converted into long-chain olefinic hydrocarbons through the Methanol-to-Olefins (MtO) process. Next, in the Olefins-to-Jet (OtJ) process, these olefins undergo hydroprocessing to produce jet fuel isomers, yielding a jet fuel fraction (approximately 80% by weight), as well as naphtha and offgas.

What makes MtJ flexible is its modular and scalable nature, as it can be implemented in smaller, decentralized plants that use liquid eMethanol as a feedstock. This flexibility offers advantages in logistics and distribution, allowing for easier integration into existing infrastructure compared to more centralized methods like Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.

The Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ) process can use both fossil methanol and eMethanol as feedstocks. However, eMethanol is typically preferred in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production because it is renewable and fossil-free. eMethanol is produced from captured CO₂ and renewable hydrogen, which makes it a key component in producing eKerosene with a much lower carbon footprint compared to conventional methanol derived from fossil fuels. Using eMethanol ensures that the resulting eKerosene is carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative, contributing to more sustainable aviation practices.

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis requires syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) as a feedstock, which must be produced through gasification of coal, natural gas, or biomass. This process typically requires large, centralized facilities, making it more complex and capital-intensive. In contrast, the Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ) process uses liquid methanol, which can be produced from renewable sources like CO₂ and green hydrogen. This enables the establishment of smaller, more flexible, and distributed production plants, reducing infrastructure costs and simplifying logistics.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e8dd7bd5994173d6a216b14/t/5ec2e39f3dae1216502b0c9d/1589830576965/LiquidWind_socialsharing.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-05-14 17:56:40.483996

Daniel Galpin, ICF Managing Director, stated “Decarbonising transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector.
In conclusion, the WTTC-ICF framework provides a comprehensive and actionable blueprint for the Travel and Tourism sector to unite behind sustainable aviation and marine fuels.","The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), in partnership with the global consultancy firm ICF, has unveiled a groundbreaking new framework aimed at transforming the Travel and Tourism sector’s approach to sustainability. The initiative targets one of the industry’s most pressing challenges: dramatically increasing the production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels to significantly reduce transport-related carbon emissions. This ambitious plan marks a decisive step forward in accelerating the transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources within a sector that plays a vital role in the global economy.

Currently, Sustainable Aviation Fuel accounts for a mere 0.3 percent of global jet fuel consumption, a figure that starkly highlights the urgency for rapid change. To align with the global goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, SAF production must surge by more than four hundred times, escalating from just over one billion two hundred fifty million litres today to a staggering 450 billion litres annually. Achieving this level of supply will require the construction of approximately six thousand five hundred new renewable fuel production plants scattered across the globe. The challenges faced by SAF are mirrored in the marine sector, where Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF) also grapples with limited supply capacity and infrastructure.

Julia Simpson, WTTC President & CEO, said “Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand. If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and stalled climate progress.

“Every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play. This framework gives them the blueprint. Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity; it’s a business imperative and governments must incentivise the production of SAF, not just set targets for the sector.”

What makes Sustainable Aviation Fuel uniquely promising compared to other decarbonisation technologies is its compatibility with existing aircraft engines and fuel systems, a characteristic known as being a “drop-in” solution. This means that SAF can be integrated into current aviation operations without requiring costly modifications or replacements of existing fleets. However, the road to widespread adoption is obstructed by several critical barriers. High production costs, insufficient infrastructure for fuel distribution, and intense competition for sustainable feedstocks have all contributed to keeping SAF volumes low and prices exceptionally high — sometimes up to ten times greater than conventional jet fuel.

The new framework developed by WTTC and ICF offers a clear and practical roadmap tailored to engage every business within the Travel and Tourism ecosystem, regardless of its size or specific role. It categorises stakeholders into four distinct groups: Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, and Investors. This tiered approach provides actionable steps for each group to contribute meaningfully. For example, businesses can participate by joining global sustainability campaigns, supplying waste products suitable for fuel production, investing capital into new production facilities, or committing to purchase sustainable fuel certificates. The framework leaves no doubt that every business has a vital part to play in driving this transformation.

Real-world examples highlighted in the report demonstrate that momentum is already building within the industry. In Asia, the Erawan Group has pioneered the conversion of waste oil from its hotel operations into Sustainable Aviation Fuel, showcasing an innovative approach to resource utilisation. Similarly, Jet2, a leading UK airline, has taken a bold step by investing in a domestic SAF plant that uses recyclable household waste as feedstock. These case studies serve as proof points that sustainable fuel initiatives are not just theoretical ideas but are actively shaping the future of travel.

Daniel Galpin, ICF Managing Director, stated “Decarbonising transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector. While transport industries, particularly aviation with its focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), have recognised the importance of sustainable fuels and are couragesouly working towards a new era, there remains a significant journey ahead. It is essential for the broader tourism ecosystem to take action and provide support to meet the targets set, as well as to implement both operational and strategic changes required.

“ICF is proud to have collaborated closely with WTTC to identify the roles that tourism stakeholders can adopt and the actions they can take to facilitate the decarbonisation of the sector, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future.”

The report also underscores a crucial warning: failure to act collectively and swiftly could lead to unintended economic consequences. Governments around the world are moving toward implementing SAF mandates, requiring fuel blends containing five to ten percent sustainable content by the year 2030. Without adequate industry-wide engagement, these mandates risk driving up travel costs and restricting consumer options, which could hamper demand for air travel and negatively impact the broader economy.

This issue carries immense economic weight, as the Travel and Tourism sector is projected to generate sixteen and a half trillion dollars in revenue and support over four hundred sixty million jobs globally by 2035. Scaling up sustainable fuels is therefore not only an environmental necessity but also an economic imperative. The industry’s ability to meet ambitious climate goals while sustaining growth depends heavily on embracing and accelerating the use of SAF and other renewable alternatives.

In conclusion, the WTTC-ICF framework provides a comprehensive and actionable blueprint for the Travel and Tourism sector to unite behind sustainable aviation and marine fuels. By fostering collaboration, encouraging investment, and promoting adoption at every level, the sector can overcome existing barriers and lead the way toward a cleaner, greener future. The time to act is now — the environmental health of the planet, the vitality of the global economy, and the future of travel depend on it.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WTTC-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 14:56:36.281150

SAF production has been disappointingly slow to scale up, in part due to the complex and costly investments needed to get facilities off the ground. The ambition of the UK policy is to de-risk the private investment needed and subsequently propel this nascent industry forward. The policy, termed a revenue certainty mechanism (RCM), ensures producers a guaranteed level of revenue as the market matures. This sort of scheme is not new—it has worked well in establishing an offshore wind sector for the UK—but is new for SAF production. The UK government is proposing the industry (in fact mainly the airlines) fund the scheme, adding additional layers of cost to a sector already exposed to incredibly high SAF pricing.

What are the key issues airlines and IATA are prioritizing in the UK when it comes to SAF?

A fair price for SAF, transparency around the pricing from suppliers and a means to scale up domestic production.

Where needed, policy intervention to correct a market failure.

An incentive scheme for SAF production in the UK that does not add to existing pressure on airlines finances.

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Officer at International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways, explains further …

What is the latest on SAF?

The UK SAF mandate started this year and initially requires 2% of all aviation fuel supplied in the UK to be SAF, ramping up to 10% by 2030. The EU has a similar mandate, with a 2% requirement in 2025 but their mandate is for 6% by 2030.

A large amount of SAF is currently produced in the US where incentive schemes through tax credits have bolstered investments, while in the UK there is one facility today producing commercial volumes of SAF and plans for test facilities that can scale up in the next five years. In 2024, SAF production volumes reached 1 million tonnes (1.3 billion litres), double the 0.5 million tonnes (600 million litres) produced in 2023. SAF accounted for 0.3% of global jet fuel production and 11% of global renewable fuel.

Are the mandates working?

SAF is key to the aviation sector meeting its Net Zero CO2 emissions by 2050 commitment, IATA anticipates 65% of the decarbonization will come from the use of SAF. But we are facing challenges – SAF under the mandate is more expensive than anticipated and European airlines are therefore paying far more than other operators to fly as all our flights are subject to the mandate – whether it be in the UK or EU. Governments in Europe have legislated for SAF use through mandates, before essential production incentives have kicked in.

Stimulating supply is important – it will ensure airlines can maximize the use of SAF and abate CO2 emissions quicker, but also will keep prices down. Airlines are currently paying on average ~ 3 to 5 times more for SAF over traditional jet fuel, which is far higher than anticipated when the policy was designed. It seems the suppliers are simply passing on their obligations under the mandate to the airlines via compliance fees, and there is a significant gap between SAF market prices and the real cost of SAF airlines are facing at airports, which is a lose-lose for both airlines and consumers.

What can be done to speed up production?

The development of a UK SAF industry is vital to bring scale of SAF locally, so we’re not importing all our sustainable fuel to meet mandates. Our focus is the incentive mechanism, known as the Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RCM), which will guarantee the pricing structure for producers. While we’re fully supportive of an RCM, the decision about who pays for the mechanism is worrying airlines.

Under current proposals, airlines and their suppliers could end up paying even more to fund the new SAF plants. We must ensure new proposals are not at the expense of keeping air travel affordable and accessible when aviation drives billions of pounds of economic value (GVA – Gross valued Added) and supports hundreds of thousands of jobs across the economy. Fuel bills are typically up to a third of an airline’s costs, and in the UK, we already pay significantly higher costs than our competitors with Air Passenger Duty, higher airport charges and business rates, and carbon charges through the UK Emissions Trading System.

We believe there is a different way to fund the RCM: using the aviation industry’s contribution into the UK Emissions Trading System. The UK ETS was set up in 2021 as a way to reduce CO2 emissions from heavy industries and is paid into by firms in energy-intensive sectors - including aviation. It’s estimated there will be ample contribution to the Treasury over the coming 10 years from aviation ETS - around £1 billion to £4 billion. This funding could be used for SAF projects which is entirely consistent with the original purpose of the scheme. Indeed, in the EU, ETS funds are recycled to provide SAF allowances to contribute to the price difference between SAF and kerosene and support the Innovation Fund[1] which backs projects for the innovation of low-carbon technologies.",https://www.iata.org/contentassets/9c75d7065f6f44e5946f36ab6c32ad29/big-ben.png,N,,2025-05-14 18:56:08.496152

Sustainable Supersonic Jets: A Farce or Achievable?
| SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel Could Make Flying Greener Soon | Clean Skies Ahead?
Unlike Concorde, today’s supersonic jets are being designed with sustainability, efficiency, and digital optimization in mind.
Supersonic jets have marked a return, not just in engineering labs and factories, but in the public imagination.","Nearly 70 years after the Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee formed and began investigating the potential of supersonic jets, a new wave of designs is emerging; will the models-in-the-making today ensure or impede the aspirations for sustainable aviation?

Earlier this year, American Boom Supersonic’s experimental jet XB-1 broke the sound barrier, reaching the speed of Mach 1.122. Lifting off from California’s Mojave Air & Space Port, the moment echoed the historic accomplishment of the Bell X-1, which flew in the same location in 1947, flying faster than Mach 1 for the first time in human history.

Marking renewed ambitions to bring supersonic flight back to commercial airlines, promises of great speed have raised significant questions about their environmental impact. Over two decades since the legendary Concorde made its last flight, the question remains: will its successors overcome the issues that led to its retirement?

The New Contenders

The supersonic race of the Cold War era was defined by three major contenders: the USA’s Boeing 2707, the USSR’s Tupolev Tu-144, and the UK-France’s Concorde. Among them, only Concorde succeeded in entering the commercial market. Today, contenders in a supersonic resurgence race include Boom Supersonic (USA), Comac (China), and Venus Aerospace (USA), chasing ambitions to re-establish super-fast air travel, this time for good.

Founded in 2014 by CEO Blake Scholl in an Oakland basement, Boom is now leading the commercial supersonic charge with its flagship project: Overture. The company’s use of computational fluid dynamics testing for the XB-1 model — a prototype of Overture — has led to a substantial reduction in development costs.

“We can run the equivalent of hundreds of wind tunnel tests overnight in simulation for a fraction of the cost of a real wind test,” Scholl stated.

Set to enter service in 2029, the Overture already has 130 orders from American Airlines, United Airlines, and Japan Airlines. Boom opened its superfactory last year, and it is estimated that it will be manufacturing 66 Overtures annually. Signalling its commitment “to build sustainability into its entire aircraft program,” Boom’s bespoke propulsion system, Symphony, has been designed to run entirely on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

However, with supersonic jets requiring significantly more fuel than subsonic and SAF representing only 0.5% of jet fuel currently used due to its scarce and expensive production, such aims could be deemed overambitious, at least for now.

Across the Pacific, China’s Comac is developing its supersonic vision as well; its C949 jet is projected to reach speeds of Mach 2.04, surpassing Overture’s 1.7. Compared to Concorde, the C949 jet promises a 50% greater range (6,800 miles) and a 95% reduction in noise.

Comac’s innovations to combat pollution reportedly include a “shape-shifting” fuselage to reduce sonic booms and noise disruption, and AI-driven aerodynamics to maximize fuel efficiency. With a debut planned for 2049, C949 represents a longer-term strategy to lead in both speed and sustainability.

Then, something of a hybrid between a rocket and an aircraft comes Venus Aerospace‘s hypersonic Stargazer M4 jet — a science-fiction fantasy hoping to become a reality. The jet will target speeds of Mach 4 — and potentially Mach 9 — with a top cruising altitude at the edge of space: the Karman line.

Powered by an innovative rotating detonation rocket engine, a next-generation propulsion system that Venus claims is both more powerful and more fuel-efficient, the Stargazer has attracted support from NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense. If successful, it could redefine commercial air travel by the 2030s.

Sustainable Supersonic Jets: A Farce or Achievable?

While the resurgence of supersonic travel is stirring excitement, it is accompanied by a chorus of concern. Supersonic jets burn significantly more fuel per passenger than subsonic ones. According to estimates, each passenger seat in Overture’s 64–80 capacity aircraft will use 2 to 3 times more fuel than a standard business/first class cabin.

Thus, the promised affordability of supersonic flights is called into question. Will they repeat the Concorde’s financially unsustainable exclusivity or revolutionise the aviation industry?

Moreover, as supersonic jets cruise at higher altitudes — well into the stratosphere — emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and water vapour may have more serious implications for ozone depletion and radiative forcing. However, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), assessment of the environmental impact of modern supersonic civilian aircraft is limited; with none currently in operation, data is insufficient.

Beyond emissions volume and fuel type (traditional jet fuel or SAF), the factors affecting a jet’s climatic impact and fuel efficiency include fleet size, aircraft technology, speed, and flight path.

SAF, often hailed as a solution to aviation’s CO₂ emissions, may currently be out of reach as a saving grace. Derived from biomass, recycled materials, and even captured carbon, SAF remains scarce and expensive at present. But international investment is growing, with efforts focused on innovation and scaling up production.

The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, for example, aims to increase the share of SAF at European airports from just 2% in 2025 to 70% by 2050 — an ambitious target that, if met, could significantly reshape aviation’s climate footprint.

Lessons from Concorde

The shadow of Concorde still looms over the industry. A technological marvel when it entered the industry in 1976 with British Airways and Air France, one problem after another led to its retirement in 2003. High operational and maintenance costs undercut its appeal; the noise pollution made it impractical for overland routes; its engines were inefficient by modern standards; mounting environmental and safety concerns further eroded public support, and eventually, demand waned.

Unlike Concorde, today’s supersonic jets are being designed with sustainability, efficiency, and digital optimization in mind. Boom’s engineers have developed an airframe made of carbon fiber composites, which are both lighter and stronger than traditional metals. In theory, this could lead to a significant reduction in fuel burn.

Aiming to make supersonic travel viable over land, both Boom and Comac are working to reduce noise levels of supersonic jets, seeking to avoid the glass-shattering sonic booms that once confined Concorde to transoceanic routes. In parallel, NASA is researching low-boom technologies to create less disruptive shockwaves. Comac may win the gold medal if it succeeds in making C949’s “noise level like a blowing hairdryer” as the company claims it could.

Yet, even with all the promises of greener technology and quieter skies, the same fundamental challenge remains: is there a viable market for supersonic travel that is both profitable and sustainable? If so, will it extend beyond the global elite?

Between 1990 and 2019, aviation made major strides in energy efficiency, cutting the fuel required per passenger-kilometre from 2.9 megajoules (MJ) to 1.3. However, with flight demand quadrupling over the same period, aviation’s emissions increased overall. Even if the promises of improved efficiency and eventual affordability are met, will large increases in demand, particularly for intercontinental travel requiring more fuel, lead to greater environmental impact?

Looking to the Future: Aviation’s Race to Decarbonise

Commercial aviation accounts for roughly 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, but its total impact on warming is closer to 4%, factoring in non-CO₂ pollutants and contrails. Across the board, aviation’s survival in a carbon-conscious world depends on scaling up SAF, electrifying regional aircraft, and developing new propulsion systems — from hydrogen to hybrid-electric.

With international commitment being promoted by the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation’s initiatives and ICAO to avoid patchy progress and uneven regulation, a more sustainable supersonic future in aviation may be achievable through international cooperation.

However, as alluring as futuristic supersonic — nay, hypersonic — flight may be, pouring billions into ultra-fast jets might be a high-stakes gamble, especially for what could prove to be a niche market or a repeat of Concorde’s costly missteps. Critics may argue that such investment may be premature, potentially diverting resources from more scalable green innovations — technologies that could offer a more reliable path toward sustainable progress in aviation.

Supersonic jets have marked a return, not just in engineering labs and factories, but in the public imagination. Driven by a blend of nostalgia, innovation, and national pride, the motivations of the sixties persist; nevertheless, the world they enter is greatly different from the one when Concorde first appeared. Greater dedication to environmental targets, stronger public scrutiny, and larger equity concerns cast long shadows across their glossy fuselages.

Will it be Boom, Comac, or Venus to reel in a new golden age of flight — speedier, cleaner, smarter — or an unsuspecting underdog? Or will the perpetuity of innovation be sacrificed for a quick spectacle, ushering in another hiatus to realising a science-fiction fantasy?",https://impakter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XB-1_FT07-2-e1747235827441.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 12:57:46.267397

SAF is an alternative to fossil jet fuel and reduces greenhouse gas emissions on average by 70% on a lifecycle basis. While the fuel is more costly to produce than jet fuel, the UK Government’s SAF measures protect industry and consumers from excessive costs, it said.

In addition, the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) will keep ticket price changes minimal – keeping fluctuations to £1.50 a year on average – and will be industry funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it would continue to engage with industry on the details of the RCM, including pricing.

A new round of government funding is also being announced to offer fuel producers a share of £400,000 to support the testing and qualification of green fuels, helping to get them to market quicker. This support for producers follows £63 million of funding made available through the Advanced Fuels Fund this year.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:

“I want to see a golden age for green aviation and today sees take off for sustainable flights.

“Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality – and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.”

The new legislation will help industry meet its requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year, which specifies that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030, be made with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

The UK Government said its approach on low carbon fuels could add up to £5 billion to the economy by 2050 and position the UK as a global hub for SAF production.

Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK, said:

“This is a welcome announcement given the importance of the RCM to commercialising and scaling-up SAF production in the UK, a technology key to decarbonising aviation by 2050. A UK SAF industry, kick-started by the RCM and SAF Mandate, can create tens of thousands of jobs across the country whilst supporting our world-class aviation sector to deliver economic growth.

“We look forward to working with government on scheme design and how contracts are allocated, so that we balance the need to deliver the SAF required to support mandate compliance, whilst keeping costs as low as possible through a competitive and transparent bidding process that places the consumer at its heart.”

Duncan McCourt, Chief Executive of Sustainable Aviation, said:

“We hugely welcome the publication of this important legislation. SAF is a crucial element in the plan to decarbonise aviation as it can be used in existing aircraft with existing infrastructure.

“The challenge now is to scale the industry, ensuring we have enough SAF to meet the mandate whilst keeping costs low and create thousands of jobs in the process.

It is political, economic, and cultural.","As the global aviation industry works towards decarbonisation goals, the pace and direction of progress are increasingly shaped by shifting political landscapes. Changes in government bring altered priorities, funding frameworks, and regulatory approaches, creating both opportunities and potential headwinds.

In a panel discussion at Sustainable Skies World Summit, taking place at Farnborough International Airport from 14-15 May, senior figures from major airlines, government, and sustainability organisations offered insights into how these politics are influencing the net-zero transition.

Geopolitical Uncertainty

The backdrop to the discussion acknowledged the current period of increased geopolitical uncertainty. In both the UK and the US, trade tensions and populist politics are reshaping priorities, leading to the potential for adverse impacts on climate commitments.

The panellists acknowledged that in the US, President Trump has expressed consistent scepticism towards climate change and has implemented policies that reflect this stance. Meanwhile, Duncan McCourt, Chief Executive at Sustainable Aviation, noted that the increasingly popular Reform party in the UK is following suit, and as a result, the public and political rhetoric surrounding net-zero priorities is changing.

Polona Gregorin, Head of Unit Mobility at the European Commission, highlighted the risks associated with this dynamic political landscape. In particular, the transition to using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents a long-term investment that requires a stable course and consistent regulations. Without consistency, investors and operators alike face uncertainty, which risks hindering progress at a time when momentum is most needed.

Economic Development

Despite the impact of political tensions on net-zero ambitions, the panellists were optimistic that the support for SAF could continue due to economic factors.

Gregorin stressed that in Europe, SAF production will help ensure Europe remains a competitive market in the sector. This drive complements the European Union’s regulatory mandates for SAF, motivated by the need to decarbonise aviation

Likewise, in the US, support for SAF is persisting across party lines by focusing on economic development and job creation, rather than solely on climate impact. For example, Jill Blickstein, Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer at American Airlines, cited the extension of federal SAF tax credits to 2031 as a key win.

Blickstein said:

We've worked closely with both Republicans and Democrats on the hill to make the case for Sustainable Aviation Fuel as a job creator, as a way to support communities, and as a form of production and economic power that can stretch across the United States.

We've seen a nice buildup of support for staff on both sides of the aisle, so that SAF doesn't have to be a partisan climate issue. It's an economic opportunity.

Furthermore, Diana Birkett Rakow, Senior VP of Public Affairs & Sustainability at Alaska Airlines, noted that opportunities to enhance sustainability will also arise from the federal government’s present focus on improving the nation’s Air Traffic Control System. Last week, US Secretary of Transportation Sean P. Duffy announced a plan to build a new air traffic control system to replace the nation’s current infrastructure. This system should be able to deliver improved efficiencies in flight paths and operations that will, in turn, reduce emissions from fuel.

As a result, although decarbonisation may not be the primary priority, the industry can still leverage relevant opportunities to advance progress towards sustainability.

State-Level Support in the US

In addition to federal support, arguably driven by the potential for SAF to act as an engine for economic growth, state-level initiatives in the US also play a pivotal role in advancing the sector.

For example, Birkett Rakow detailed how Washington State has enacted SAF production incentives, drawing companies like Twelve to invest in local infrastructure. Meanwhile, Illinois has taken a different route, offering purchase incentives for SAF buyers. With these contrasting models, US states are able to serve as test beds for scalable national strategies.

The utility of these initiatives was highlighted by Jill Blickstein, who noted that American Airlines is purchasing SAF to be transported via a pipeline from a production facility in Texas to Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD), leveraging the state of Illinois’ purchase incentives.

Growth vs. Green in the UK

In the UK, despite noting that the increasingly popular Reform Party appears to be echoing Trump-era attitudes and deprioritising climate action, McCourt maintained that the current UK government remains committed to its net-zero roadmap. In fact, earlier today, new measures to accelerate the support of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) were introduced in Parliament.

However, panel moderator, Dirk Singer, Head of Sustainability at SimpliFlying, pointed out a disconnect between a sustainable ambition and recent government decisions—specifically the approval of multiple airport expansions, including the proposed third runway at Heathrow. Adding to this tension, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has publicly prioritised nationwide economic growth over the protection of natural ecosystems.

Political tension and uncertainty are therefore clearly present in the UK, adding to a global picture of uncertainty around the future of climate policy.

With this in mind, the panel reached consensus on a key message: the aviation sector must not allow political shifts to derail its net-zero trajectory. It must remain on course to decarbonise regardless of who’s in power in each nation.

International Models – Singapore

To achieve this vision, the industry requires clear, consistent regulations and policies that encourage stable investment in key technologies such as SAF. Policies and pricing currently vary greatly across nations with different mandates, levy structures, and incentive schemes, and the most prosperous model is not yet evident.

As an example, Singapore’s emerging model drew particular attention during the panel discussion for its consumer-facing approach. A small surcharge on airline tickets, essentially a SAF levy, will be used by the government to purchase SAF centrally, creating cost stability and transparency.

Jill Blickstein praised this model, stating that it fosters awareness among consumers while also sending a stable demand signal to producers. However, McCourt cautioned against this approach in the UK, where public support is already wavering away from politics in favour of net-zero initiatives. He argued that an explicit tax on consumers could easily contribute to eroding public support for climate action in aviation.

Looking Ahead

Ultimately, the event highlighted that the challenge to decarbonising aviation isn’t just technological. It is political, economic, and cultural.

Accelerating technology remains a key challenge, but aligning policy and public support is arguably even harder—and even more essential.

Senate File 657 and its House companion, House File 1054, contain 17 provisions, including the creation of tax credits for film production, sustainable aviation fuel, as well as the elimination of older credit programs.

It also overhauls the Research Activities Credit, a program that provides tax incentives to businesses, replacing it with the Research and Development Tax Credit Program. The new program, administered by the Iowa Economic Development Authority, would provide tax credits to eligible businesses that incur qualified research expenses in Iowa.

Under the bill, qualifying businesses include those primarily engaged in sectors including second-generation food innovation, crop protection, diagnostic analytics and immunotherapies, chip technologies and microelectronics, medical equipment and supplies, software and technology, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, consumer products and others.

Republican Sen. Dan Dawson, of Council Bluffs, the bill’s sponsor, said the overhaul of business tax incentives makes the credit awards more up-front and makes the process less “cumbersome.”

“It's always important for us to look at some of our whole programs and figure out how we can modernize our new programs,” Dawson said.

The creation of the Research and Development Tax Credit Program includes a provision that would take back credits awarded to businesses that lay off workers and knowingly employ individuals not authorized to legally work in Iowa.

This provision comes from a bill introduced earlier in the session that would’ve clawed back Research Activities tax credits from businesses that implemented “mass layoffs” in 2024. The legislation was aimed at Deere & Co. after workforce layoffs over the past few years.

Republican Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, of Wilton, who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, said the provision would make sure that state funds don’t go to companies that lay off Iowa workers.

“Both provisions are designed to punish a company that knowingly hires undocumented immigrants and/or ships jobs out of the country or out of the state,” Kaufmann told reporters Monday. “If you're doing either of those practices, you do not deserve our tax credits. I would have preferred a chain saw approach. This is a scalpel approach, but at least it gives them (IEDA) a hammer.”

During Deere’s 2022 layoffs, it announced that work from the 250 jobs at the Waterloo facility would be moved to Ramos Component Works in Mexico, which was completed last year. The company has, however, repeatedly affirmed its commitment to U.S. manufacturing and has said the layoffs are responses to changes in the farm economy, not an effort to move jobs out of the U.S.

Democratic Sen. Bill Dotzler, of Waterloo, backed the bill, adding that state funding should go to companies that keep jobs in Iowa.

“If we're giving large amounts of money to a business and they have a major layoff, we should be clawing back those resources and using them in the right spot,” Dotzler said during Senate debate Tuesday.

The legislation also would keep, but pare down, Endow Iowa after a full cut of the program was originally floated.

The Endow Iowa program awards tax credits to people who make donations to qualified community foundations across the state. The bill would reduce its funding to $3.5 million for FY 2026 from the $6 million provided in 2025.

The adjustment to the program is projected to increase Iowa general fund revenues by $2.3 million in FY 2027.

Here is what else the bill would do:

London, UK: The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), in collaboration with global consultancy ICF, has today launched a bold new framework urging the entire Travel & Tourism sector to unite in tackling one of its toughest challenges: scaling up the production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels.

The report, Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel, sets out a practical roadmap for how every business in the sector, no matter its size or role, can help address transport-related emissions and accelerate the shift to cleaner fuels.

Julia Simpson, WTTC President & CEO, said ""Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand. If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and stalled climate progress.

“Every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play. This framework gives them the blueprint. Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity; it’s a business imperative and governments must incentivise the production of SAF, not just set targets for the sector.”

Today, SAF accounts for just 0.3% of global jet fuel use. To meet net-zero targets by 2050, production must increase more than 400-fold – from 1.25BN litres today to over 450BN litres. That will require as many as 6,500 new renewable fuel plants worldwide. Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF) faces similar supply and infrastructure constraints.

Unlike other decarbonisation options, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ solution. It works with existing engines and aircraft. But high production costs, limited infrastructure, and feedstock competition have kept volumes low and prices high – up to 10 times that of conventional fuel.

The new WTTC-ICF framework offers clear, tiered actions for Travel & Tourism stakeholders to engage, whether as Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, or Investors. From joining campaigns and supplying waste products, to funding production facilities or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates, the report makes it clear: every business can contribute.

Daniel Galpin, ICF Managing Director, stated “Decarbonising transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector. While transport industries, particularly aviation with its focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), have recognised the importance of sustainable fuels and are couragesouly working towards a new era, there remains a significant journey ahead. It is essential for the broader tourism ecosystem to take action and provide support to meet the targets set, as well as to implement both operational and strategic changes required.

“ICF is proud to have collaborated closely with WTTC to identify the roles that tourism stakeholders can adopt and the actions they can take to facilitate the decarbonisation of the sector, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future.”

Real-world case studies show how action is already underway. The Erawan Group is turning hotel waste oil into SAF, in Asia, whilst Jet2 has invested in a UK-based SAF plant using recyclable household waste.

Crucially, the report warns that unless the sector acts collectively, SAF mandates introduced by governments, requiring a 5% to 10% blend by 2030, could increase travel costs and limit consumer choice.

With Travel & Tourism forecast to generate $16.5TN and support over 460MN jobs by 2035, scaling up sustainable fuel isn’t just an environmental challenge. It’s an economic imperative.

American families have been hit hard by inflation, and more and more consumers are seeking out lower-cost options at the pump.
In April, both Minnesota and Iowa (the only states that specifically report E15 sales) announced record breaking sales in 2024, with sales in Iowa surging by an impressive 45%.
Just weeks ago, Growth Energy’s Technical Director for Market Development Reid Wagner was one of the first customers to take advantage of Costco’s new Unleaded 88 (or E15) fuel offering.

Action on the waiver fulfills a key element of President Trump’s executive order directing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to leverage E15 “to meet any projected temporary shortfalls in the supply of gasoline across the Nation.”

The decision takes the guesswork out of summer fueling options, giving our retail partners the regulatory certainty they need to manage inventory and protect a critical market for U.S. farmers. It could not come at a better time.

E15 demand is growing at a record pace. American families have been hit hard by inflation, and more and more consumers are seeking out lower-cost options at the pump. In April, both Minnesota and Iowa (the only states that specifically report E15 sales) announced record breaking sales in 2024, with sales in Iowa surging by an impressive 45%.

Other states aren’t far behind. Just weeks ago, Growth Energy’s Technical Director for Market Development Reid Wagner was one of the first customers to take advantage of Costco’s new Unleaded 88 (or E15) fuel offering. Located at the Costco in La Vista, Nebraska, it is the first Costco location in the country to offer the higher blended fuel. And thanks to Nebraska’s E15 Access Standard, Nebraskans will soon have access to low-cost Unleaded 88 at even more locations.

Of course, retailers and motorists aren’t the only winners. E15 can also help deliver on the President’s trade agenda, which includes securing domestic markets for domestic goods, so U.S. producers are less vulnerable to foreign trade barriers. It provides American farmers with more certain and reliable markets for their corn.

The bottom line is that E15 presents a huge opportunity to boost the rural economy and lower prices at the pump. And with a temporary waiver in place, our champions in Congress and the White House can focus on passing legislation restoring permanent, unrestricted access to E15 for all months, all states, all stations and all fuel dispensers.

That is Growth Energy’s goal, and we urge readers to help us keep up the momentum by visiting GrowthEnergy.com/E15Now, where biofuel supporters can quickly connect with their members of Congress. We have a coalition that is bigger and broader than it’s ever been, and with a permanent E15 fix in place in advance of the 2026 summer driving season, the need for temporary EPA waivers will be a thing of the past.

Of these companies, Unearthed found that five had apparently continued to promote claims that were actually or in effect identical after the ruling.
A spokesperson for Sources Alma said the company had “never intended to mislead consumers with inappropriate or erroneous environmental claims”.
She told Unearthed: “We are aware of the [ASA’s] decision on 19 January 2022 concerning our TV ad featuring the Aqua Pura brand.
By the end of last year this had resulted in rulings against 44 companies for breaching rules against misleading environmental claims.","Major brands, including car manufacturers, an airline, and a bottled water company have apparently continued to promote environmental claims after they were ruled “misleading” in a crackdown on greenwashing by the UK’s advertising watchdog, an Unearthed investigation has found.

Among them is Virgin Atlantic, which has kept posts pinned to the top of its Instagram, TikTok, and X accounts boasting it completed the first transatlantic flight using “100% sustainable aviation fuel.” The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled against Virgin nine months ago for using this language in an advert, saying it was likely to lead a “significant proportion” of people to “overestimate” the environmental benefits of the fuel.

Meanwhile, the car company Renault published videos on Facebook and YouTube last year claiming its hybrid cars offered “up to 80% electric driving” in the city, despite a 2023 ASA investigation which found that this wording fell foul of rules against misleading environmental claims.

And the front page of bottled water brand Aqua Pura’s website continued to boast about its “NEW Environmentally Friendly Caps”, three years after the ASA told the company to stop claiming that plastic bottle lids were “eco-friendly”.

An Unearthed analysis of online marketing activity by 44 companies ruled to have made misleading green claims in recent years found that at least five had continued to promote similar or identical claims after the ASA ruling.

Andrew Simms, director of the campaign group Badvertising, which has called for tougher regulation of greenwashing and a ban on advertising “high carbon” products, said that for some industries the rules against making false green claims seemed to be “hidden in clouds of their own planet-heating pollution”.

He added: “If, on the rare occasions that complaints to the regulator are investigated and upheld they simply get ignored, then the system seems broken, leaving the public in the grip of misinformation.”

A spokesperson for the ASA, which regulates UK advertising across all media, said that the regulator’s work on climate change and the environment “continues to be a priority area and we continue to proactively monitor green claims using our AI-based Active Ad Monitoring system, finding ads that potentially break our rules and getting those that do quickly amended or removed”.

“Monthly sweeps show high levels of compliance and we continue to act where we spot non-compliant ads,” he told Unearthed. “We are seeing businesses adapting and evolving to make better evidenced, more precise green claims.”

Unearthed provided the ASA with details of recent marketing activity by 16 companies that the regulator ruled had made misleading environmental claims. Of these companies, Unearthed found that five had apparently continued to promote claims that were actually or in effect identical after the ruling. These included instances where claims had been newly posted after the ruling, or where they had been maintained in prominent positions like the frontpage of a website, or pinned to the top of a social media account.

In addition, Unearthed provided details about a further 11 companies, which are not named in this article. These involved claims which merited review by the regulator but were less clear-cut – for example, instances where a claim was repeated shortly before it was ruled misleading.

The ASA spokesperson said the regulator would carefully assess the ad claims Unearthed had brought to its attention and it would “consider each case on its merits”. He added that the ASA could not make definitive judgements within the “short timeframe provided”, but that its initial assessment suggested there were “a number of examples that do not present obvious or clear-cut issues under our rules”.

However, at least three of the companies made changes to their websites this week after being approached by Unearthed for comment. These included Sources Alma, the French parent company of Aqua Pura.

A spokesperson for Sources Alma said the company had “never intended to mislead consumers with inappropriate or erroneous environmental claims”.

She told Unearthed: “We are aware of the [ASA’s] decision on 19 January 2022 concerning our TV ad featuring the Aqua Pura brand.

“At the same time, our marketing department, whose teams are split between the UK and France, has undergone a major restructuring. As a result, it has not been able to apply the ASA’s recommendations effectively across all communication channels between 2022 and 2023.”

Yesterday afternoon (Tuesday) Aqua Pura’s website was offline while “undergoing maintenance”.

The company’s spokesperson added: “In any case, we are now in line with ASA recommendations.”

A Renault UK spokesperson said the car manufacturer would “investigate the issues raised” by Unearthed’s findings.

However, a spokesperson for Virgin Atlantic told Unearthed that sustainable aviation fuel would be key to achieving net zero, and that the company’s transatlantic flight using the fuel was a “milestone for the industry”.

She added: “Social posts were shared to mark the achievement, demonstrate the breadth of the project and the challenges that remain for the industry to achieve net zero.”

The Virgin posts remained in place as of this morning.

The ASA launched its multi-year crackdown on greenwashing in advertising in September 2021, in what it said was an effort to support the UK’s push for net zero. By the end of last year this had resulted in rulings against 44 companies for breaching rules against misleading environmental claims.

Unearthed carried out a review of online activity by these companies to see how they had responded to the ruling.

The rules on environmental claims require advertisers, among other things, to be clear about the basis of the claim being promoted. If an advertiser makes an “absolute” claim – like describing a product as “eco-friendly” or “100% recycled” – this has to be supported by a high level of evidence.

“Eco-friendly” claims

In a November 2023 radio advert, Virgin Atlantic claimed it was about to become the first commercial airline to fly across the Atlantic using “100% sustainable aviation fuel.”

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) are derived from waste cooking oils and fats, green waste and non-food crops. They generally have a lower “lifecycle” carbon footprint than petroleum-based jet fuels, but they produce just as much CO2 when burned.

Virgin’s “Flight100” was hailed by the UK government at the time as a “major milestone towards making air travel more environmentally friendly” and heavily promoted by the airline.

However, the ASA received complaints about Virgin’s radio advert, and in August last year it ruled that the unqualified claim “100% sustainable aviation fuel” was misleading. The regulator said a significant proportion of listeners would think this meant that the fuel itself was 100% sustainable. It concluded that most consumers were “unlikely to be aware of the extent to which fuels described as sustainable aviation fuel still had negative environmental impacts”. Virgin had told the ASA that the flight was calculated to have delivered 64% savings in “lifecycle” greenhouse gas emissions, but this, the regulator said, showed that SAF “still produced significant emissions over its lifecycle”. It told Virgin that in future adverts referring to SAFs needed to explain the environmental impact of the fuel.

Despite this, Virgin kept video posts which use the “100% sustainable aviation fuel” claim “pinned” to the top of its corporate Instagram, TikTok and X feeds – ensuring they are among the most visible posts to visitors on these pages. In addition, Virgin marked the first anniversary of the flight with a new Instagram post repeating the claim, published four months after the ASA ruling. None of these posts provide any qualifying information about SAF’s environmental impact.

A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson told Unearthed that it was “committed to achieving net zero by 2050” and SAF would be key to this as “one of the most immediate levers to decarbonising long haul aviation”.

She added: “Flight100 was a milestone for industry globally as it proved that SAF is a safe, 100% drop-in replacement for fossil fuel and demonstrated the radical collaboration required to drive increased production, supply and uptake.”

But Alethea Warrington, head of aviation, heat and energy at climate charity Possible, told Unearthed: “The aviation industry wants us to believe that speculative and unscalable technologies can keep the sector growing while bringing emissions under control.”

Unearthed also found several instances of carmakers apparently repeating claims about the environmental impact of their vehicles similar to those that the ASA had already ruled to be misleading.

In November 2023, the ASA issued a ruling against Renault for an online advert that said one of its hybrid vehicles offered “up to 80% electric driving in the city”.

The regulator concluded there were “numerous possible interpretations” of the claim, from the share of journeys completed in electric mode to the time spent without petrol. It ruled that Renault’s advert “omitted material information and was likely to mislead.”

Renault told the ASA it removed the original ad. However, in 2024 it used the same claim in a Youtube video for the Renault Symbioz, and separately in two Facebook posts for other vehicles. In all three examples, no explanation of how this claim should be interpreted was included.

Misleading advertising of fossil fueled cars to make them appear ‘green’ risks delaying crucial emissions reductions

– James Ward, AdFree Cities

A Renault spokesperson told Unearthed: “Renault UK takes its responsibilities seriously and will investigate the issues raised.”

In early 2024, the car brand MG was reprimanded by the ASA for using the unqualified claim “zero emissions” in an online advert for a range of electric and hybrid models, including the MG5 EV. The ASA ruled that the company needed to be clear that the phrase “zero emissions” only applies to an electric vehicle while it is “being driven,” since EV manufacturing and charging can still produce carbon emissions. For plug-in hybrids, the ASA said MG must be clear that the claim applies only when driving on battery power.

Still, MG’s August 2024 brochure for an MG5 electric vehicle repeatedly boasted that it had “zero emissions” without providing any further qualifying text. Separately, a description on MG UK’s website for a used MG4 included the unqualified text: “Eco-Friendly & Cost-Efficient: Say goodbye to fuel costs and embrace zero emissions with an electric vehicle that’s both good for the planet and your wallet.”

After Unearthed approached MG for comment this week, this text was removed from the used car advert on its website.

A spokesperson for the brand said: “MG Motor UK fully accepted and then immediately responded to the ASA at the time, this related to a hybrid vehicle also being featured alongside an EV model and this was a point of clarification from the ASA which we accepted. We will always fully and actively cooperate with the ASA regarding any guidelines and all our creative teams are actively briefed to do so.”

James Ward, anti-greenwash campaigner at the campaign group Adfree Cities, said car advertising was “rife with greenwash claims,” and that “misleading advertising of fossil fueled cars to make them appear ‘green’ risks delaying crucial emissions reductions needed in the transport sector, which remains the UK’s highest emitting sector.”

Unearthed also found examples of plastic product manufacturers apparently continuing to promote claims after they had been ruled misleading. Easigrass, a UK artificial grass manufacturer, had continued to claim on its website that one of its plastic grass products was“eco-friendly and 100% recyclable” more than a year after the ASA told the company to stop making these claims about a similar product. The watchdog had found no evidence that plastic grass was “eco-friendly”, and concluded the term “fully recyclable” was misleading because there was only one facility in the entire UK that could recycle plastic grass.

After Unearthed approached Easigrass for comment the company removed the claims from its website, and thanked Unearthed for bringing them to its attention.

A spokesperson said: “We acknowledge the ASA’s ruling issued in March 2024 and can confirm that the marketing language referenced in your message was scheduled for removal following that decision.”

The spokesperson added that the claims identified by Unearthed had been “inadvertently missed” by Easigrass’ website team.

Similarly, the bottled water brand Aqua Pura was censured in January 2022 for a TV ad describing its 500ml bottle as a “100% recycled & recyclable bottle with eco-friendly cap.” The ASA ruled the claim “100% recycled bottle” misleading, since the cap and label were not recycled. The ruling also took the brand to task for claiming its bottles had an “eco-friendly cap”. Aqua Pura was told not to “overstate the environmental benefit” of its products, and not to “claim that products made of plastic were ‘eco-friendly’ or ‘nature friendly’”.

Despite this, until this week the front page of the brand’s website continued to boast about “NEW Environmentally Friendly Caps.” Unearthed also found that in two 2022 LinkedIn adverts posted after the ruling, Aqua Pura continued to describe its bottles as “100% recycled plastic” without clarifying this excluded caps and labels, and called their plastic caps “eco-friendly.” And a Facebook post for that year’s National Recycling Week also claimed “our bottles” are made from “100% recycled plastic,” without qualification.

A spokesperson for Aqua Pura’s French parent company, Sources Alma, told Unearthed that preserving the environment was an “absolute priority”, but that a 2022 restructuring of the company’s marketing department meant it had “not been able to apply the ASA’s recommendations effectively across all communication channels between 2022 and 2023”.

“Nevertheless, we take the ASA’s recommendations and the various points raised [by Unearthed] very seriously,” she continued.

“We will verify the current and future application of all recommendations relating to environmental claims, particularly on our website.”

She said the company’s product labels made clear that the claim “100% recycled” excluded caps and labels, and added: “We will also make this clear on our website.”

She added that the brand’s bottle caps remained attached to the bottles, preventing “the cap from being lost in nature, thereby reducing the amount of plastic waste that could end up in the environment”. “We are proud of this technology and wanted to highlight the benefits of this specific cap compared to a standard cap,” she said.

Tougher sanctions?

The ASA is responsible for investigating complaints to ensure ads comply with its advertising codes, and banning those it deems misleading, harmful, or irresponsible.

It is clear that consumers care about sustainability, or else companies would not even mention the environment

– Genevieve Guenther, End Climate Silence

The ASA claims most advertisers comply with its rulings to avoid significant reputational damage, however it does not have the power to impose fines. For “non-compliant” offenders, its sanctions are limited to naming and shaming companies on its website, requesting ads be removed from search engines and social media platforms, and issuing its own paid ads calling out violations. Once censured, companies are instructed not to run substantively similar ads in the future.

Campaigners like Badvertising have argued that the ASA is “not fit for purpose” to regulate advertising claims by polluting companies, and have called for reforms including “a mandate for legally binding rulings and fines” and enforcement powers to “suspend an advert pending investigation”.

Victoria Harvey, a PhD student at University of East Anglia specialising in sustainability in UK advertising, told Unearthed: “My research shows that the advertising trade bodies in general do not go far enough to protect against greenwashing.”

She added: “We urgently need updated and fit for purpose regulation that works harder to protect consumers and the environment.”

However, the ASA spokesperson said it was seeing businesses “adapting and evolving” in response to its work on climate and environment, and making “better evidenced, more precise green claims”. He added: “As an example, following our airline rulings on ‘sustainable’ and ‘eco-friendly’ claims, of the circa 140,000 ads monitored, five were found to be non-compliant.”

“It is clear that consumers care about sustainability, or else companies would not even mention the environment,” said Genevieve Guenther, founding director of media watchdog organisation End Climate Silence and author of The Language of Climate Politics.

“So even if the ASA cannot fine the companies that continue to mislead about the climate impacts of their products and services, consumers can boycott those companies to register their displeasure and even force them to change their practices.”

Political pressure

In some parts of Europe, governments have begun to impose tougher restrictions on advertising for high-carbon products. In 2022, France became the first European country to ban fossil fuel advertising. Cities including Edinburgh, in Scotland, and the Hague, in the Netherlands, have introduced bans on a range of high-carbon advertising, including commercial flights, SUVs and cruise ships.

In London seven months ago, Green Party Assembly member Caroline Russell urged Mayor Sadiq Khan to restrict fossil fuel ads on the capital’s public transport network, which has hosted more than 240 oil and gas campaigns since 2018.

“I’ve repeatedly challenged the Mayor on [Transport for London’s] advertising policies, and this new research leaves no room for doubt,” she told Unearthed. She added that companies that misled the public about their environmental records have “no business having access to prime advertising space in our city.“",https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1981169007-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 09:56:07.416690

An alternative to fossil jet fuel, SAF remains more expensive to produce, though the government’s dedicated SAF measures protect both the industry and consumers from inflated costs.

In addition to existing measures; the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) will aim to keep ticket price changes minimal as the fuel alternative sees wider adoption throughout the industry, with fluctuations expected to sit around 1.50 GBP per year on average, which will in turn be funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers.

The Department for Transport (DfT) has stated it will continue to engage with industry leaders in order to maintain a consistent standard with regards to the RCM, including pricing.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:

I want to see a golden age for green aviation and today sees take off for sustainable flights.

Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality – and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.

We are making the UK one of the best places in the world to produce sustainable aviation fuel, putting the pedal down on growth and boosting job opportunities across the country as part of the Plan for Change.

The new legislation is hoped to aid the aviation industry to meet requirements set out by the SAF mandate, which was introduced in January this year and specifies that a minimum of 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030 be made with sustainable fuel. This is planned to be extended to 22% by 2040.

Duncan McCourt, Chief Executive of Sustainable Aviation, said:

We hugely welcome the publication of this important legislation. SAF is a crucial element in the plan to decarbonise aviation as it can be used in existing aircraft with existing infrastructure.

The challenge now is to scale the industry, ensuring we have enough SAF to meet the mandate whilst keeping costs low and create thousands of jobs in the process. This legislation will help to do that.

In 2021, the ASA announced a greenwashing crackdown, censuring companies for making claims without evidence.
As recently as last week, at least five of these firms were still posting claims they had been censured for making, according to Unearthed.
However, it has continued to claim on its website that one of its plastic grass products is “eco-friendly and 100% recyclable”.

Greenpeace UK’s investigative journalism unit, Unearthed, reports that Virgin Atlantic, Renault and Aqua Pura are among companies that continued to publish unfounded claims about the environmental credentials of their products after being told to remove such adverts by the advertising watchdog.

In 2021, the ASA announced a greenwashing crackdown, censuring companies for making claims without evidence. It said 44 firms had made misleading advertisements. As recently as last week, at least five of these firms were still posting claims they had been censured for making, according to Unearthed.

ASA rules mean advertisers need to be clear about the evidence behind any environmental claims, and a high burden of proof is needed for any absolute claims, such as that a product is “sustainable” or “eco-friendly”. The watchdog has few powers to ensure companies comply with their rulings; it says if firms are seen to be ignoring the rules it can “significantly damage their reputation”. However, it does not have the power to issue fines to advertisers.

Sanctions available include naming the company on the ASA website, asking search engines to remove paid search ads that contain the claim, asking social media companies to remove “non-compliant content”, and taking out its own paid search ads naming the company.

Virgin Atlantic has kept posts “pinned” to the top of its Instagram, TikTok and X accounts, claiming it completed the first transatlantic flight using “100% sustainable aviation fuel”, according to Unearthed. This is despite the ASA making a ruling against the airline nine months ago for this wording in an advert, because it was likely to lead consumers to overestimate the carbon savings of using the fuel – it thought consumers would interpret “100% sustainable aviation fuel” to mean the fuel was completely sustainable with no negative environmental impact.

Renault repeatedly published videos on Facebook and YouTube last year claiming its hybrid cars offered “up to 80% electric driving in the city”, despite a 2023 ASA ruling finding this wording to be misleading.

Other car manufacturers have continued to make green claims about their vehicles after being censured by the ASA. MG last year promoted its hybrid cars as “zero emissions”, but the ASA ruled the claim misleading, as hybrid vehicles are not zero emissions when being powered by petrol or diesel. Electric vehicles are zero emissions only when driving if the electricity that charged them is 100% renewable. An August 2024 brochure for an electric vehicle promoted in an original ad banned by the ASA repeatedly used the term “zero emissions” without clarification. Meanwhile, an ad for a used MG4 on the company’s website suggests that drivers can “embrace zero emissions” without clarification.

The front page of bottled water brand Aqua Pura’s website as recently as last week boasted about its “NEW Environmentally Friendly Caps”, three years after the ASA told the company to stop claiming that plastic bottle lids were “eco-friendly”. Easigrass, which makes plastic lawns, was told by the ASA more than a year ago to stop calling its synthetic grass products “eco-friendly”. However, it has continued to claim on its website that one of its plastic grass products is “eco-friendly and 100% recyclable”. At the time, the watchdog said that there was no proof that plastic grass was “eco friendly” and only one facility in the UK can recycle plastic grass.

An ASA spokesperson said: “Our world-leading work on climate change and the environment continues to be a priority area and we continue to proactively monitor green claims using our AI-based Active Ad Monitoring system, finding ads that potentially break our rules and getting those that do quickly amended or removed.

“We are seeing businesses adapting and evolving to make better evidenced, more precise green claims. As an example, following our airline rulings on ‘sustainable’ and ‘eco-friendly’ claims, of the circa 140,000 ads monitored, five were found to be non-compliant. But where we find issues, we act; as evidenced by our series of high-profile rulings against a range of businesses including some of the biggest companies in the world.”

A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: “We’re committed to achieving net zero by 2050 and key to this will be using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is one of the most immediate levers to decarbonising long haul aviation. Flight100 was a milestone for industry globally as it proved that SAF is a safe, 100% drop-in replacement for fossil fuel and demonstrated the radical collaboration required to drive increased production, supply and uptake.

“Social posts were shared to mark the achievement, demonstrate the breadth of the project and the challenges that remain for the industry to achieve net zero.”

A Renault spokesperson said: “Renault UK takes its responsibilities seriously and will investigate the issues raised.”

An Aqua Pura spokesperson said its advertising team had recently undergone a restructuring, meaning it was difficult to implement all the recommendations, adding: “We will verify the current and future application of all recommendations relating to environmental claims, particularly on our website.”

MG Motor UK said: “MG Motor UK fully accepted and then immediately responded to the ASA at the time, this related to a hybrid vehicle also being featured alongside an EV model and this was a point of clarification from the ASA which we accepted.

Carinata is a key crop in Nufarm’s bioenergy portfolio, delivering renewable biofuel feedstocks that enable the production of low-carbon fuels and materials for difficult-to-decarbonize sectors such as the aviation industry. Together, Nufarm and ChrysaLabs are pioneering an innovative approach to measuring and verifying actual soil carbon sequestration utilizing a combination of improved agricultural management practices and rotations that include Nufarm Carinata as an intermediate crop (i.e., planted in between primary crop production seasons).

By offering end-to-end carbon measurement, verification, and project management, ChrysaLabs offers a fully integrated solution that is expected to eventually deliver significantly lower costs and to enable true scaling—an achievement rarely seen in the carbon market. ChrysaLabs’ technologically advanced Direct Contact Proximal Sensing, combined with a uniquely adaptable approach to project execution, is expected to ensure that every aspect of the carbon cycle will be accurately captured, verified, and monetized.

Nufarm’s planned expansion will target the many available hectares that can benefit from this intermediate cover crop. By cultivating crops such as Nufarm Carinata for biofuel, the project has the potential to create a seamless carbon-to-carbon cycle, seeking to sequester atmospheric carbon back into the soil while delivering measurable and real-world climate benefits.

“Nufarm is committed to driving sustainability in the biofuel industry by developing solutions that not only reduce emissions but also create new economic opportunities for farmers,” said Brent Zacharias, Group Executive, Nufarm Seed Technologies. “Partnering with ChrysaLabs allows us to help ensure that the carbon impact of our SAF projects will be accurately measured and verifiable, reinforcing our commitment to responsible and impactful innovation.”

“This partnership represents an advancement in carbon modeling, unlocking new business opportunities such as scalable biofuel production,” said Samuel Fournier, CEO and Co-founder, ChrysaLabs. “By providing full-spectrum carbon project management, we are minimizing cost barriers, reducing complexity, and unlocking new opportunities for monetization, effectively bridging the gap between sustainability and profitability.”

Beyond its immediate impact on biofuels, this project serves as a proof-of-concept for how ChrysaLabs’ data-driven approach may bridge sustainability with new revenue streams, facilitating carbon monetization at an unprecedented scale. Independently certified to standards that cover the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive, the aviation industry’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), and the Roundtable for Sustainable Biomaterials, Nufarm’s bioenergy programs offer traceable and accountable sustainability assurance. This assurance gives airlines and other corporate customers a path to demonstrating credible and verifiable emission reduction claims to meet Scope 1 and Scope 3 targets.

The Nigerian government hosted a high-level regional workshop in Lagos State from 5th to 9th May 2025. Organised by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) in collaboration with the National Council on Climate Change Secretariat (NCCCS) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the hybrid workshop aimed to explore SAF investment opportunities and address the sector’s financial and operational challenges.

The workshop brought together stakeholders from 14 African countries, alongside SAF project developers and international financial institutions. Coordinated by Mrs. Yinka Iriobe of the NCAA’s Directorate of Air Transport Regulations, the event focused on investment de-risking strategies, project bankability, and mechanisms for sustainable financing.

A significant milestone of the workshop was the formal inauguration of six (6) Technical Working Groups (TWGs) by the Director-General of NCAA, Captain Chris Najomo. These groups will oversee SAF development in Nigeria across key areas: Policy and Regulation, Feedstock and Production, Funding and Investment, Technology and Innovation, Environmental and Social Impact, and Infrastructure and Logistics.

The final two days of the event were dedicated to Nigeria’s domestic SAF roadmap, with participants engaging in robust discussions around project financing, capacity building, and access to sustainable energy sources in aviation.

The workshop formed part of the ACT-SAF Africa-India Project (Part II), designed to provide assistance, training, and capacity building for SAF development. Presentations from developers and financiers highlighted the need for robust risk mitigation frameworks and multi-stakeholder collaboration to support viable SAF production in Africa.

Participants also examined the SAF direct supply chain, financing tools, and best financial practices, while mapping key stakeholders and identifying existing financial instruments that could support the SAF value chain.

Delivering the keynote address on behalf of Captain Najomo, Barrister Bukola Teriba, Regional Manager of NCAA’s Lagos Office, underscored the importance of access to finance for SAF projects, stressing its pivotal role in mitigating the aviation sector’s environmental footprint.",https://newscentral.africa/wp-content/uploads/Nigeria-Leads-Africas-Drive-for-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-Financing2.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 06:56:47.944896

Sustainable aviation fuel is an alternative to fossil jet fuel, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 70% on average on a lifecycle basis.

With decarbonisation key to accelerating expansion plans, the government has also announced an additional £400,000 of funding for producers so that new clean fuels can get to market quicker, speeding up the UK’s path to green flying.

While the fuel is more costly to produce than jet fuel, the government’s SAF measures protect industry and consumers from excessive costs.

In addition, the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) will keep ticket price changes minimal, keeping fluctuations to £1.50 a year on average, and will be industry-funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers.

The Department for Transport (DfT) will continue to engage with industry on the details of the RCM, including pricing.

Speeding up the SAF commercialisation process

A new round of government funding is also being announced to offer fuel producers a share of £400,000 to support the testing and qualification of green fuels, helping to get them to market quicker.

This support for producers follows £63m of funding made available through the Advanced Fuels Fund this year.

The government’s commitments to green fuel will help deliver on its missions to kickstart economic growth via job creation and become a clean energy superpower. It will also allow the UK to go further and faster with expansion plans, boosting the tourism industry.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, stated: “Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality, and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.

“We are making the UK one of the best places in the world to produce sustainable aviation fuel, putting the pedal down on growth and boosting job opportunities across the country.”

22% of jet fuel must be green by 2040

The new legislation will help industry meet its requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year, which specifies that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030, be made with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

The government’s approach to low-carbon fuels could add up to £5bn to the economy by 2050 and position the UK as a global hub for SAF production.

“A UK SAF industry, kick-started by the RCM and SAF Mandate, can create tens of thousands of jobs across the country whilst supporting our world-class aviation sector to deliver economic growth,” explained Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK.

Duncan McCourt, Chief Executive of Sustainable Aviation, added: “We hugely welcome the publication of this important legislation. SAF is a crucial element in the plan to decarbonise aviation as it can be used in existing aircraft with existing infrastructure.”

He concluded: “The challenge now is to scale the industry, ensuring we have enough SAF to meet the mandate whilst keeping costs low and creating thousands of jobs in the process. This legislation will help to do that.”",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2510038875.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 06:56:59.018885

US budget bill would prolong 45Z, boost crops

New York, 13 May (Argus) — A proposal from House Republican tax-writers would extend for four additional years a new tax credit for low-carbon fuels and adjust the incentive to be more lenient to crops used for biofuels. Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee on Monday introduced their draft portion of a far-reaching budget bill, which included various changes to Inflation Reduction Act clean energy subsidies. But the ""45Z"" Clean Fuel Production Credit, which requires fuels to meet an initial carbon intensity threshold and then ups the subsidy as emissions fall, would be the only incentive from the 2022 climate law to last even longer than Democrats planned under the current draft. The proposal represents an early signal of Republicans' plans for major legislation through the Senate's reconciliation process, which allows budget-related bills to pass with a simple majority vote. The full Ways and Means Committee will consider amendments at a markup this afternoon, and House leaders want the full chamber to vote on the larger budget bill before the US Memorial Day holiday on 26 May. Afterwards, the proposal would head to the Republican-controlled Senate, where lawmakers could float further changes. But the early draft, in a chamber with multiple deficit hawks and climate change skeptics that have pushed for a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act, is remarkable for not just keeping but expanding 45Z. The basics of the incentive — offering benefits to producers instead of blenders, throttling benefits based on carbon intensity, and offering more credit to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — would remain intact. Various changes would help fuels derived from US crops. The most notable would prevent regulators measuring carbon intensity from considering ""indirect land use change"" emissions that attempt to quantify the risks of using agricultural land for fuel instead of food. Under current emissions modeling, the typical dry mill corn ethanol plant does not meet the 45Z credit's initial carbon intensity requirement — but substantially more gallons produced today would have a chance at qualifying without any new investments in carbon capture if this bill were to pass. The indirect land use change would also create the possibility for canola-based fuels, which are just slightly too carbon-intensive to qualify for 45Z today, to start claiming some subsidy. Fuels from soybean oil currently qualify but would similarly benefit from larger potential credits. Still, credit values would depend on final regulations and updated carbon accounting from President Donald Trump's administration. Since the House proposal does not address the current law's blunt system for rounding emissions values up and down, relatively higher-carbon corn and canola fuels still face the risk of falling just below 45Z's required carbon intensity threshold but then being rounded up to a level where they receive zero subsidy. The House bill would also restrict eligibility to fuels derived from feedstocks sourced in the US, Canada, and Mexico — an attempt at a middle ground between refiners that have increasingly looked abroad for biofuel inputs and domestic farm groups that have lobbied for 45Z to prioritize US crops. That language would make more durable current restrictions on foreign used cooking oil and significantly reduce the incentive to import tallow from South America and Australia, a loss for major renewable diesel producers Diamond Green Diesel, Phillips 66, and Marathon Petroleum. The provision would also hurt US biofuel producer LanzaJet, which has imported lower-carbon Brazilian sugarcane ethanol as a SAF feedstock to the chagrin of domestic corn ethanol producers. The bill would also require regulators to set more granular carbon intensity calculations for different types of animal manure biogas projects, all of which are treated the same under current rules. Other lifecycle emissions models treat some dairy projects at deeply negative carbon intensities. Those changes to carbon intensity calculations and feedstock eligibility would kick in starting next year, meaning current rules would remain intact for now. The proposal would however phase out the ability of clean energy companies without enough tax liability to claim the full value of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies to sell those tax credits to other businesses. That pathway, known as transferability, would end for clean fuel producers after 2027, hurting small biodiesel producers that operate under thin margins in the best of times as well as SAF startups that were planning to start producing fuel later this decade. Markets unresponsive, but prepare for new possibilities There was little immediate reaction across biofuel, feedstock, and renewable identification number (RIN) credit markets, since the bill could be modified and most of the changes would only take force in the future. But markets may shift down the road. Limiting eligibility to feedstocks originating in North America for instance could continue recent strength in US soybean oil futures markets. July CBOT Soybean oil futures closed 3pc higher on Monday at 49.92¢/lb on the news and have traded even higher today. The spread between soybean oil and heating oil futures is then highly influential for the cost of D4 biomass-based diesel RIN credits, which are crucial for biofuel margins and have recently surged in value to their highest prices in over a year. The more lenient carbon accounting will also help farmers eyeing a long-term future in renewable fuel markets and will support margins for ethanol and biodiesel producers reliant on crops. Corn and soy groups have pushed the government for less punitive emissions tracking, worried that crop demand could wane if refiners could only turn a profit by using lower-carbon waste feedstocks instead. The House bill, if passed, would still run up against contradictory incentives from other governments, including SAF mandates in Europe that restrict fuels from crops and California's efforts to soon limit state low-carbon fuel standard credits for fuels derived from vegetable oils.

EU consults on tariffs for €95bn US imports

Brussels, 9 May (Argus) — The European Commission is consulting on an extensive list, worth €95bn ($107bn), of US industrial, agricultural and other imports that could be subject to tariff countermeasures. The long list includes extends from livestock, biofuels, wood pellets to metals, aircraft, tankers and polymers . The consultation runs until midday on 10 June. It is aimed at stakeholders affected by US measures and possible EU rebalancing measures. Also considered for possible countermeasures are restrictions, worth €4.4bn, on EU exports to the US of steel, iron and aluminium scrap, as well as toluidines, alcoholic solutions and enzymes (CN codes 7204, 7602, 292143, 330210 and 350790). The commission linked the possible new measures to US universal tariffs and to Washington's specific tariffs on cars and car parts. The commission said the public consultation is a necessary procedural step. It does not automatically result in countermeasures. The EU also launched a WTO dispute procedure against the US for Washington's universal tariffs, set at 20pc for EU goods and currently paused at 10pc, and at 25pc on all imports of vehicles and car parts. The commission will need approval by EU governments under a simplified legislative procedure. Officials say this will complete a legal act for the countermeasures, making them ""ready to use"" if talks with the US do not produce a ""satisfactory"" result. The list of products potentially targeted includes livestock, along with items ranging from spectacles to antiques. The 218-page list includes a range of agricultural and food products including oats, maize, and cereal pellets. Also included are biodiesel and wood pellets (CN codes 38260010, 44013100), as well as paper and cotton products. Aluminium, iron, steel are listed together with a wide range of other goods from gas turbines, ships propellers and blades, aircraft, sea-going tankers and other vessels. Polymers, copolymers, polyesters and other products are not spared (CN codes 39039090 and more). On 10 April, the EU paused its reciprocal tariffs against the US for 90 days, responding to a US pause. The EU notes that €379bn, or 70pc, of the bloc's exports to the US are currently subject to new or paused tariffs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -United Airlines (UAL) may not take delivery of the Boeing (BA) 737 MAX 10 until 2027 or 2028 because of uncertainty about when the plane will be approved for use, an executive for the carrier said Tuesday.

Boeing has faced significant delays in getting the smaller MAX 7 certified, which must happen before the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration can then certify the larger MAX 10.

United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella told reporters on the sidelines of an event that the airline is taking MAX 9 airplanes as it waits for the certification of the 10.

""In supply chain terms, we want to make sure we get our aircraft so we've committed to the MAX 9,"" Nocella said. ""Until we know the MAX 10 is going to be delivered, we don't want to have an aircraft that doesn't arrive.""

Nocella said United may not achieve its earlier goal of being one of the first delivery customers for the MAX 10.

""We want to see the aircraft certified before we make the firm commitment to convert our 9s to 10s.""

Boeing did not immediately comment.

In 2017, United made a major order of the MAX 10, which is larger and can carry more passengers. The 737 is Boeing's top-selling airliner. The FAA has currently capped production of the MAX at 38 planes per month after a 2024 mid-air emergency.

The FAA must approve an engine de-icing fix for the MAX 7 before it can certify the plane after Boeing in January 2024 withdrew a waiver request.

Alaska Airlines (ALK) told Reuters last year it did not expect to receive 737 MAX 10 airplanes until at least mid-2026.

Nocella said there is no end in sight to supply chain issues on engines and other parts.

The new 787-9 with updated interior ""should have been announced six months ago"" but for supply chain problems, he said, adding: ""I don't have a crystal ball, I can't tell you when it's going to be fixed.""

The test campaign involved high pressure turbine (HPT) blades and nozzles with the GE’s latest cooling technology that demonstrated improved durability and fuel efficiency compared to conventional turbine technology. The airfoils were inserted in the core of an F110 engine for testing.

Two test campaigns were conducted, with the first starting in 2023 focusing on initial performance validation. A second endurance campaign completed earlier this year simulated high-thrust takeoff and climb conditions to evaluate how components would withstand flight conditions.

“With endurance tests conducted on new high-pressure turbine blade cooling technologies, it shows the CFM RISE program’s early focus on durability and reliability,” said Arjan Hegeman, vice president of future of flight engineering for GE Aerospace. “This is the earliest in new technology development that we’ve done durability tests, incorporating the experience of our commercial aircraft engines flying today.”

The tests validated the thermal, mechanical and system performance of the HPT hardware, with the airfoils located in the engine’s hottest section subjected to extreme operating conditions. The next phase of testing will involve dust ingestion testing to evaluate turbine blade behavior in severe environments.

GE Aerospace is developing the compact engine core including high-pressure compressor, HPT blades and combustor technologies for a core demonstrator scheduled to be completed later this decade through the CFM RISE program. The compact core design targets significant improvements in thermal efficiency and power-to-weight ratio compared to current engine architectures.

The RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines) program, unveiled in 2021, has completed more than 250 tests and is one of the aviation industry’s most comprehensive technology demonstration efforts. Beyond the compact core, RISE is advancing engine architectures including Open Fan and hybrid electric systems.

Technologies are being tested with both conventional and alternative jet fuels, including unblended Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The CFM RISE program is targeting more than 20% better fuel burn compared to the most efficient commercial engines in service today, alongside improved durability and reliability.

The RISE program’s open fan configuration enables larger diameter fans without gear systems, potentially reducing noise and fuel consumption.

Air cargo contributed $69.3 million, or 42.5%, of Anchorage airport revenues in 2024, mostly in landing fees.
Backed by major airlines The state is investigating an SAF plant that could meet air carriers’ growing demand.

Cargo carriers, mainly on Asia-North America flights, use Anchorage as a midway refueling and cargo transfer point. About 900 million gallons of jet fuel are loaded at Ted Stevens International Airport each year. Air cargo contributed $69.3 million, or 42.5%, of Anchorage airport revenues in 2024, mostly in landing fees.

Most large cargo planes are capable of flying trans-Pacific and trans-polar routes nonstop, but the economics are still attractive for freight operators to stop in Alaska to refuel. That’s because carrying less fuel allows for more cargo to be carried, maximizing revenue.

But that advantage is threatened in part by technology advances and a requirement from the EU that airlines use a 20% blend of sustainable and conventional fuels by 2035 and 42% by 2045.

Providing cargo carriers with a cost-effective supply of SAF would give them an incentive to continue refueling stops in Alaska even if technology improves the economics of flying nonstop.

""Anchorage is already a critical refueling hub for trans-Pacific cargo, but as aviation technology evolves, we can’t rely on today’s fuel burn vs. payload advantage alone,” said Katharine Keith, Alaska Deputy Commissioner of Transportation and Public Facilities.

“Investing in sustainable aviation fuel gives carriers a long-term reason to keep stopping here -- it’s a hedge against future aircraft designs and market shifts that might otherwise bypass Alaska. Building SAF capacity secures our position in the global air logistics chain,"" she said.

Backed by major airlines

The state is investigating an SAF plant that could meet air carriers’ growing demand. Atlas Air, one of the world’s largest air cargo operators, and Alaska Airlines, a major west coast regional airline and also the state’s largest passenger carrier, are supporting the state’s effort to make SAF for blending with conventional jet fuel.

Keith is leading the initial feasibility assessments. The goal is for a plant to produce 150 million gallons per year of sustainable fuel, which is one-sixth of the current jet fuel demand in Anchorage, along with 80 million to 95 million gallons of Renewable Diesel and Renewable Naphtha. The plan has the backing of Alaska’s governor, Mike Dunleavy, who has a strong interest in renewable energy.

Keith said six other airlines, mostly cargo operators, have written letters to the state supporting the idea. Initial studies show costs for SAF would be less than what the fuel costs elsewhere because of a huge amount of biomass that is available. Organic material like fish oil or forest biomass could be converted to fuel at costs low enough to offset the capital cost of building an SAF plant, which could range from $1 billion to $3 billion, depending on the technology selected, Keith said.

At this point, the Alaska team working on the initial feasibility is looking at two technology paths, Keith said. One is a Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids, or HEFA, process using organic material like fish oil from Alaska seafood processing plants to produce synthetic kerosene for blending. Plants elsewhere producing renewable aviation and diesel fuels mostly use the HEFA process.

The second approach is a Fischer-Tropsch technology that would rely mainly on the large amount of forest biomass available. Fischer-Tropsch process is used today in South Africa to produce fuel from coal and natural gas.

Pulp to power

But there are still uncertainties. “While the FT process is proven, not many FT refineries exist globally, and not with biomass as a feedstock. That, combined with our plan for carbon sequestration, means that many aspects will be new,” Keith said.

“There is a plant similar in feedstock and scale to ours, scheduled to be operational in 2028 in Louisiana,” she said. DG Fuels’ plant, located in St. James Parish, will have a planned capacity of 13,000 b/d of SAF, according to company information.

Keith said Fischer-Tropsch is costly, but with the large volumes of forest material available, Fischer-Tropsch could be more cost-effective than HEFA.

“This was a complete surprise to us because the capital cost would be much higher, but that appears to be offset by the more limited supply of fish oil and the longer transport costs from fish plants compared with the volumes of available wood biomass and the shorter distance from harvest areas,” she said.

Studies also show that Alaska’s fisheries will be able to supply only 9% of a plant’s target output, assuming that only byproducts like fish oil are used. Also, the largest fish processing plants are at a considerable distance from Anchorage. A smaller HEFA plant could still be viable with additional organic feedstock, such as municipal waste.

The forest biomass is closer, mostly within 150 miles of Anchorage in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and the Kenai Peninsula. Estimates are that 46.2 million dry tons of live and dead timber can be reached within one mile of existing roads. For a target output of 150 million gallons a year of SAF, about 4.9 million dry tons of forest biomass, or 9.8 million green tons (with higher moisture), would be needed.

Infrastructure advantage

The existing fuel infrastructure near Anchorage offers advantages, Keith said. Anchorage’s port has 3.4 million gallons of fuel storage to supply both its airport and Joint Base Elemendorf-Richardson, a nearby military installation. If the SAF plant is built at or near an existing Marathon Petroleum refinery on the Kenai Peninsula, it can use an existing 67-mile liquids pipeline to move the SAF fuel to bulk storage in Anchorage.

An alternative plant site at Port MacKenzie, a short distance from Anchorage across Knik Arm of Upper Cook Inlet, could see the SAF fuel barged to storage facilities at Anchorage’s port.

Converting forest biomass, meanwhile, solves another problem for Alaska because much of it is damaged and dead spruce killed by beetle infestations. This creates a serious fire danger, so removing the damaged timber serves an important public purpose, Keith said.

This could be a double-win for Alaska if the technology and economics work – Alaska gets a reduced wildfire danger along with an anchor for its air carrier refueling industry.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-14 04:56:43.396575

Qantas, Sydney Airport, and Ampol, facilitated the bulk import, alongside Qantas’ Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Coalition partners.

Nearly two million litres of unblended SAF arrived this week, marking a significant step toward reducing aviation’s carbon footprint.

SAF stands as the most promising near-term solution to decarbonize the aviation industry. It offers a sustainable alternative to traditional jet fuel.

Australian Bulk SAF Delivery

On May 7, Ampol imported the SAF from Malaysia to its Kurnell facility. The fuel is now being blended with conventional aviation fuel at an approximate 18% ratio. It will undergo rigorous testing and certification before entering Sydney Airport’s supply chain.

Once certified, it will power flights departing from Sydney over the coming weeks. This volume of SAF could fuel around 900 flights from Sydney to Auckland on Qantas and Jetstar’s 737 aircraft. It will cut carbon emissions by an estimated 3,400 tonnes—equivalent to the annual emissions of about 800 cars.

This milestone highlights the capability of Ampol and Sydney Airport’s existing infrastructure to handle SAF, showing the potential for scaling up its use in Australia.

Developing a Domestic SAF Industry

It also signals growing momentum for establishing a domestic SAF industry, supported by Qantas, the national carrier.

In 2023, Qantas launched the SAF Coalition, uniting 15 major Australian and global companies committed to using SAF at scale to reduce emissions from air travel and freight, which often account for a significant portion of their carbon footprint.

A domestic SAF industry could bring substantial economic benefits. By 2040, it has the potential to contribute A$13 billion annually to Australia’s GDP.

It would support nearly 13,000 jobs in the feedstock supply chain. In addition, it will create 5,000 new jobs to build and operate SAF production facilities. These projections underscore the industry’s promise for economic growth and job creation.

Federal Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, and Local Government, The Hon. Catherine King MP, praised the initiative. “Australia has a unique opportunity to create jobs, industries, and skills by developing a domestic sustainable fuel sector,” she said.

“This import is a vote of confidence in the industry and a clear signal of demand. Our government is committed to supporting this progress as we build Australia’s future.”

Sydney Airport CEO Scott Charlton emphasized the airport’s pivotal role. “As the hub for nearly 40% of Australia’s aviation fuel uplift, Sydney Airport is well-positioned to lead the development of a domestic SAF industry,” he said.

“New South Wales, a major producer of feedstocks like canola, could become a global SAF leader with the right policy support, creating local jobs and fueling more sustainable flights.”

Qantas Group CEO Vanessa Hudson spoke of the criticality of the venture. “A domestic SAF industry is critical to decarbonizing aviation, enhancing fuel security, and creating jobs,” she said.

“This import demonstrates the demand for sustainable travel. As Australia’s national carrier, we’re committed to reducing aviation’s environmental impact, but collaboration with government and industry is essential. With 70% of our fuel uplifted in Australia, we’re eager to work together to scale SAF production.”

Plans for Future SAF Uptake

Qantas aims to source 10% of its fuel from SAF by 2030 and 60% by 2050, aligning with its Net Zero by 2050 goal. The airline currently uses SAF at London Heathrow and is exploring opportunities at other international hubs.

Through its A$400 million climate fund, Qantas is investing in SAF initiatives, including planned biofuel facilities in Queensland and New Zealand and a climate-focused venture capital fund.

Sydney Airport has set an ambitious target for 50% of its fuel uplift to be SAF by 2050. To further this goal, Qantas and Sydney Airport recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to collaborate on developing Australia’s SAF industry.

This landmark SAF import marks a turning point for Australian aviation, demonstrating the feasibility of sustainable fuel and paving the way for a cleaner, greener future.

This initiative, introduced on 14 May 2025, includes financial mechanisms to stabilize costs and mandates for increased SAF usage, promising job creation and environmental benefits.

New Legislation for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The UK government has taken a significant step towards decarbonizing its aviation sector by introducing new laws aimed at boosting homegrown sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

These measures are designed to position the UK as a global leader in this emerging industry.

The legislation includes a revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) that stabilizes costs for both consumers and the industry, alongside an additional £400,000 in funding to accelerate the testing and market entry of new green fuels.

The SAF Mandate requires at least 10% of jet fuel used in UK flights to be sustainable by 2030, with this figure rising to 22% by 2040.

This mandate supports decarbonization efforts while also creating jobs across various sectors such as engineering, tourism, and hospitality.

Economic and Environmental Benefits

The introduction of these new SAF laws is expected to have far-reaching economic and environmental benefits. By supporting green fuel production, the legislation will create jobs across the UK in sectors like engineering and tourism.

The revenue certainty mechanism is designed to limit ticket price fluctuations to an average of £1.50 per year, protecting consumers from excessive costs while promoting eco-friendly travel options.

Furthermore, the government’s £400,000 funding will help producers bring new sustainable fuels to market faster.

This complements the existing £63 million Advanced Fuels Fund aimed at supporting SAF development. These initiatives are part of a broader effort to make the UK a global hub for clean energy and green aviation.

Opportunities for Growth

Creation of jobs in engineering, tourism, and hospitality through green fuel production

Stabilization of ticket prices with minimal annual increases due to RCM

Acceleration of sustainable fuel market entry with additional government funding

Legal requirement for increased use of sustainable fuels in UK flights by 2030

Positioning the UK as a leader in clean energy and green aviation globally

International Implications

The UK’s leadership in SAF production not only strengthens its domestic economy but also enhances its geopolitical influence in climate policy and clean energy markets worldwide.

By fostering a domestic SAF industry, the country reduces reliance on fossil fuels and imports while encouraging other nations to adopt similar mandates.

This commitment could spur innovation in SAF technologies globally while ensuring that international airlines operating within the UK comply with new fuel requirements.

As such developments unfold, they may impact global supply chains positively.

In Conclusion

The UK’s ambitious plans for sustainable aviation fuel mark a pivotal moment for both its economy and environment.

By setting stringent targets for SAF usage alongside supportive financial mechanisms, these initiatives promise significant job creation while reducing carbon emissions—positioning Britain as an influential player within global efforts toward greener skies.

During a first quarter earnings call, Calumet CEO Todd Borgmann announced plans to accelerate development of the MaxSAF expansion for a fraction of the original expected cost. He explained that the company’s operations team has rapidly advanced the understanding of the potential of its assets and SAF production technology. Rather than wait for an additional reactor to be shipped and installed with other new-build assets, the company now believes it can enhance its existing reactor and some supporting assets already in Montana to bring 120 MMgy to 150 MMgy of SAF capacity online in early 2026 for $20 million to $30 million in capital. The project is primarily expected to consist of catalyst work and asset configuration, Borgmann explained, with improvements expected to increase SAF yields from the current level of 2,000 barrels per day to 8,000 to 10,000 barrels per day.

Aemetis Inc. released first quarter financial results on May 8, reporting increased biogas production, progress with efficiency improvements at the company’s ethanol plant, and resumed biodiesel deliveries. Financing activities are also underway for a proposed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project.

During an earnings call, Aemetis Chairman and CEO Eric McAfee explained that the company’s renewable natural gas (RNG) business is quickly scaling production. Capacity is currently expected to reach 550,000 MMBtu this year, increasing to 1 million MMBtu annually by the end of 2026.

According to McAfee, Aemetis Biogas is now operating or building projects at 18 dairies, with four dairy RNG projects slated to come online early this summer. Third-party verification has been completed on seven dairy pathways under the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Those pathways are currently undergoing final review at the California Air Resources Board.

McAfee also noted offsite construction has begun on a mechanical vapor recompression (MVP) system that will be installed at the company’s ethanol plant in Keyes, California. Once operational, the MVP system is expected to reduce natural use at the facility by 80%.

Regarding the ethanol market, McAfee said pricing has improved since earlier this year. The U.S. EPA’s announcement it will issue emergency waivers allowing continued E15 sales this summer provides tailwinds for margin expansion, he added.

In addition to its U.S.-based biogas and ethanol operations, Aemetis also operates a biodiesel facility in India. According to McAfee, the company resumed biodiesel deliveries to government oil companies in April. He also noted Aemetis is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) of its India subsidiary, targeting late 2025 or early 2026. In addition, Aemetis is evaluating expanding its India operations to include RNG and ethanol production.

McAfee also provided a brief update of Aemetis’ proposed 90 MMgy Riverbank project, which aims to produce SAF and renewable diesel. He said the company is in active discussions on financing structures and is awaiting further clarity on the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit and state-level SAF mandates to support project financing.

The Riverbank project also features a proposed carbon capture and storage (CCS) project. According to McAfee, the company has completed initial drilling and pipe installation for its CO2 characterization well. Data obtained from the next phase of drilling with support permitting efforts.

Aemetis reported total revenues of $42.9 million for the first quarter, down from $72.6 million reported for the same period of last year. The company attributed the decline to delays in the receipt of contracts in India from government-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs). New OMC letters of intent for $31 million were issue din April and shipments started the same month.

The Keyes plant increased revenues by $1.7 million. The increase is primarily attributed to the increase in average selling price of ethanol. The dairy RNG segment sold 70,900 MMBtu of RNG during the three-month period, up 10,100 MMbtu when compared to the first quarter of 2024.

Gross loss for the first quarter was $5.1 million, compared to a gross loss of $600,000 reported for the same period of last year. Operating loss was $15.6 million, compared to an operating loss of $9.5 million. Net loss was $24.5 million, compared to a net loss of $24.2 million.

Now, Wheels Up charter customers who opt into this initiative are able to seamlessly book a private jet or group charter flight and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.

Wheels Up will partner with Delta Air Lines to purchase SAF, ultimately allowing private fliers to participate regardless of their flight operator or departure airport.

What is SAF?

SAF is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, derived from more sustainable feedstocks. SAF is developed through advanced processes that significantly reduce its carbon footprint over the fuel's lifecycle, as compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel.

SAF is significant in its drop-in capability, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft engines without modification. By using SAF in this immediate and practical way, airlines can achieve up to an 80% reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions.

How does this SAF Program work

While SAF is expected to play a critical role in decarbonizing aviation, it remains scarce today – in 2024, it only accounted for 0.3% of global jet fuel production, and it has very limited availability.

In this context, it is impractical to ensure that every customer wishing to 'fly on SAF' has physical SAF at their airport, much less loaded into their specific flights. Through Wheels Up's program, charter customers determine the amount of SAF they wish to support, and Wheels Up coordinates with Delta to direct customer contributions through the Delta SAF Program.

By integrating SAF into Wheels Up's charter infrastructure, Wheels Up and its customers have the opportunity to help increase the demand for SAF. Such market frameworks are anticipated to play a critical role in scaling SAF production and use in the coming years.

To support this initiative, Wheels Up has partnered with Chooose, a leading software platform specializing in lower-carbon aviation solutions.

Commitment to Sustainability

With the launch of this SAF program, Wheels Up is taking a proactive step towards helping to reduce aviation's carbon footprint. This introduction empowers customers to make more sustainable travel choices and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.

Jill Greer, Wheels Up's executive vice president, investor relations and sustainability, commented, ""We are delighted to launch our Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) program. As demand for ESG-conscious travel options grows, this initiative allows our customers to take meaningful steps toward reducing their carbon footprint, while reinforcing Wheels Up's commitment to sustainable aviation.""

Charlotte Lollar, director of sustainable aviation fuel at Delta Air Lines, added, ""We are pleased to collaborate with Wheels Up to provide access to Delta's SAF supply. Through this new partnership, we're able to offer charter customers a traceable and scalable way to contribute to reducing aviation emissions - even when traveling in locations where SAF is not readily available. We are excited to continue to propel the industry forward toward more sustainable aviation solutions.""",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Wheels_Up_May25_2211113cdf.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 21:56:34.655809

Our farmers deserve increased market access, not increased barriers. ICGA is disheartened by this decision but appreciates the support of Senate members who voted in the interest of the Iowa farmer.”

Additional Background:

Production of corn continues to outpace demand. USDA is estimating we will have 1.8 billion bushels of excess corn at the end of the 2025-26 crop year. If this bill is signed by the Governor, it would destroy the opportunity to pursue massive new ethanol markets like Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Worldwide jet fuel demand is projected to be at 120 billion gallons by 2035. If just 10% of that market could be made into SAF from ethanol, this would equate to nearly 19 billion gallons of new ethanol demand or nearly 6.5 billion bushels of new corn demand. That is more than 1.5 times the amount of corn grown in Iowa today.

Other states in the U.S. are implementing CCS technology. South American already has a significantly lower carbon score for corn ethanol and is also considering CCS to lower it further. The result of this will be these states and South America will become the market for low carbon ethanol. Iowa will no longer be the most competitive place to produce ethanol. Plants will be forced to stop expansion plans and ultimately will pay less for corn and that will mean less profitability for Iowa’s corn farmers.",https://www.croplife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Corn-Closeup.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 22:57:01.220965

With decarbonisation key to accelerating expansion plans, the government has also announced an additional £400,000 of funding for producers so that new clean fuels can get to market quicker, speeding up the UK’s path to green flying.

SAF is an alternative to fossil jet fuel, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions on average by 70% on a lifecycle basis. While the fuel is more costly to produce than jet fuel, the government’s SAF measures protect industry and consumers from excessive costs.

In addition, the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) will keep ticket price changes minimal – keeping fluctuations to £1.50 a year on average – and will be industry funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers. The Department for Transport (DfT) will continue to engage with industry on the details of the RCM, including pricing.

A new round of government funding is also being announced, to offer fuel producers a share of £400,000 to support the testing and qualification of green fuels, helping to get them to market quicker. This support for producers follows £63 million of funding made available through the Advanced Fuels Fund this year.

Taken together, the government’s commitments on green fuels will help deliver on its missions to kickstart economic growth via job creation, become a clean energy superpower and will allow the UK to go further and faster with expansion plans, giving a boon to the tourism industry.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:

I want to see a golden age for green aviation and today sees take off for sustainable flights.

Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality – and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.

We are making the UK one of the best places in the world to produce sustainable aviation fuel, putting the pedal down on growth and boosting job opportunities across the country as part of the Plan for Change.

The new legislation will help industry meet its requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year, which specifies that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030, be made with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

The new financial mechanism is another display that the UK is rock solid in its commitment to building a prosperous hub for homegrown sustainable fuel production. Furthermore, this vital update provides SAF producers and the industry at large the confidence and stability to plough investment into clean energy.

The government’s approach on low carbon fuels could add up to £5 billion to the economy by 2050 and position the UK as a global hub for SAF production.

Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK, said:

This is a welcome announcement given the importance of the RCM to commercialising and scaling-up SAF production in the UK, a technology key to decarbonising aviation by 2050. A UK SAF industry, kick-started by the RCM and SAF Mandate, can create tens of thousands of jobs across the country whilst supporting our world-class aviation sector to deliver economic growth.

We look forward to working with government on scheme design and how contracts are allocated, so that we balance the need to deliver the SAF required to support mandate compliance, whilst keeping costs as low as possible through a competitive and transparent bidding process that places the consumer at its heart.

Duncan McCourt, Chief Executive of Sustainable Aviation, said:

We hugely welcome the publication of this important legislation. SAF is a crucial element in the plan to decarbonise aviation as it can be used in existing aircraft with existing infrastructure.

The challenge now is to scale the industry, ensuring we have enough SAF to meet the mandate whilst keeping costs low and create thousands of jobs in the process.

Abstract

Biofuels induced land-use change (ILUC) emissions have been widely studied over the past 15 years. Many studies have addressed uncertainties associated with these estimates. These studies have broadly examined uncertainties associated with the choice of economic models, their assumptions and parameters, and a few bio-physical variables. However, uncertainties in land-use emission factors that represent the soil and vegetation carbon contents of various land types across the world and are used to estimate carbon fluxes due to land conversions are mostly overlooked. This paper calls attention to this important omission. It highlights some important sources of uncertainty in land-use emissions factors, explores the range in these factors from established data sources, and compares the influence of their variability on ILUC emissions for several sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathways. The estimated land-use changes for each pathway are taken from a well-known computable general equilibrium model, GTAP-BIO. Two well-known carbon calculator models (CCLUB and AEZ-EF) that represent two different sets of emissions factors are used to convert the GTAP-BIO estimated land-use changes to ILUC emissions. The results show that the calculated ILUC emissions obtained from these carbon calculators for each examined SAF pathway are largely different, even for the same amortization time horizon. For example, the ILUC emissions values obtained from the AEZ-EF and CCLUB models for producing jet fuel from corn ethanol for a 25-year amortization period are 24.9 gCO2e/MJ and 15.96 gCO2e/MJ, respectively. This represents a 60% difference between the results of these two carbon calculators for the same set of land-use changes. The results show larger differences for other pathways as well.",https://www.anl.gov/sites/www/themes/custom/anl_public_theme/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-13 21:56:38.675860

Secondly, we anticipate that Mainland China will prioritise the production and export of SAF over feedstock exports.

The US is likely to increasingly prioritise domestically sourced feedstocks, which could impact biofuel producer margins. However, unless there is a change in the current 45z tax credit, we anticipate that traditional US feedstock sources, like soybean, will continue to be supplanted by alternatives such as UCO and tallow.

Mainland China’s strategic pivot in the biofuel market reflects a significant shift in its energy policy. As global demand for sustainable energy rises, China has witnessed declining exports of used cooking oil (UCO), a once-popular feedstock for biodiesel production. This decline has forced the nation to reconsider its reliance on UCO and to explore alternative sources, particularly in response to increasing international competition and stringent environmental regulations.

In contrast to UCO, the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is gaining momentum in China’s biofuel strategy. SAF, derived from renewable biomass and waste sources, presents a promising solution to meet the country’s carbon-neutral goals while addressing aviation’s growing emissions. As the global aviation sector pivots toward greener alternatives, China is positioning itself to be a key player in the SAF market, investing in technologies and infrastructure to support large-scale production.",https://i0.wp.com/www.thailand-business-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Mainland-Chinas-Strategic-Shift-Decreasing-UCO-Exports-and-the-Growth.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 22:57:05.027573

H. Con. Res. 14, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025, instructed the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to recommend legislative changes that would decrease deficits by a specific amount over the 2025-2034 period. As part of the reconciliation process, the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure approved legislation on April 30, 2025, with provisions that would decrease deficits.

Estimated Federal Cost

In CBO’s estimation, the reconciliation recommendations of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure would decrease deficits by $36.6 billion over the 2025‑2034 period. The estimated budgetary effects of the legislation are shown in Table 1. The costs of the legislation fall within budget functions 400 (transportation), 500 (education, training, employment, and social services), 700 (veterans benefits and services), and 800 (general government).

Return to Reference

Basis of Estimate

For this estimate, CBO assumes that the legislation will be enacted in summer 2025. CBO’s estimates are relative to its January 2025 baseline and cover the period from 2025 through 2034. Outlays of appropriated amounts were estimated using historical obligation and spending rates for similar programs. CBO’s estimate incorporates administrative and judicial action as of April 10, 2025, the date that H. Con. Res. 14 was approved by the Congress.

Direct Spending

Enacting the bill would increase direct spending by $27.8 billion over the 2025-2034 period (see Table 2), CBO estimates. Most of that amount would result from specified direct appropriations for activities of the Coast Guard and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), offset by a reduction in direct spending from funds rescinded from transportation projects and programs involving federal buildings.

Coast Guard Assets Necessary to Secure the Maritime Border and Interdict Migrants and Drugs

Section 100001 would appropriate $21.2 billion for the Coast Guard to acquire, procure, and improve equipment and facilities, as follows:

$14.6 billion for vessels, including offshore patrol cutters, polar security cutters, and arctic security cutters;

$3.2 billion for shoreside infrastructure;

$2.0 billion for aircraft; and

$1.5 billion for other activities, including $500 million to acquire, procure, or construct a floating dry dock at the Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore, Maryland.

Based on historical spending patterns for similar projects, and using information from the Coast Guard, CBO estimates that enacting section 100001 would increase outlays by $19.6 billion over the 2025-2034 period.

Changes to Mandatory Benefits Programs to Allow Selected Reserve Orders for Preplanned Missions to Secure Maritime Borders and Interdict Persons and Drugs

Section 100002 would authorize the Coast Guard to place members of the Selected Reserve on active duty under certain circumstances. That time would count toward the reservists’ entitlement for benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill; those benefits are paid from mandatory appropriations. Accounting for the increased benefits some reservists and their dependents would receive and using information from the Coast Guard, CBO estimates that each year, 250 reservists, on average, would accrue about six months of additional active duty that would be counted toward their eligibility.

Using information from the Department of Veterans Affairs, CBO estimates that the longer time reservists spend on active duty would increase direct spending by $9 million over the 2025-2034 period.

Vessel Tonnage Duties

Section 100003 would increase tonnage duties on vessels entering the United States. Those charges are levied by Customs and Border Protection and recorded in the budget as offsetting receipts (that is, as reductions in direct spending). In general, the bill would increase tonnage duty rates by 125 percent relative to rates under current law. In 2024, the government collected about $33 million in such charges.

CBO estimates that the higher rate would increase collections (and reduce direct spending) by about $38 million per year relative to current law, totaling $343 million over the 2025‑2034 period.

Registration Fee on Motor Vehicles

Section 100004 would appropriate $104 million in 2026 to support states as they implement systems for collecting registration fees for electric and hybrid vehicles. Those collections are discussed below in the section on Revenues.

Based on historical spending patterns for similar programs, CBO estimates that enacting this section would increase outlays by $102 million over the 2025-2034 period.

Motor Carrier Data

Section 100006 would appropriate $5 million to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to create a public website for tracking motor carriers’ compliance with the agency’s operating requirements. The provision also would allow FMCSA to collect fees from entities that access the website, which could be spent without further appropriation. Those collections are discussed below in the section on Revenues.

CBO estimates that enacting this section would increase outlays by $20 million over the 2025-2034 period, reflecting spending of the direct appropriation ($5 million) and the collected fees ($15 million).

Rescissions

Section 100007 would rescind funds from seven programs established under the 2022 reconciliation act with the following purposes:

Support development of sustainable aviation fuel;

Support projects to improve walkability, safety, and transportation access in disadvantaged communities;

Convert General Services Administration (GSA) facilities to high-performing green buildings;

Install low-carbon materials in GSA facilities;

Support use of emerging technologies for environmental programs in GSA facilities;

Support environmental review for transportation projects; and

Support development of low-carbon transportation materials.

CBO estimates that enacting this section would reduce budget authority by $5.2 billion and outlays by $4 billion over the 2025-2034 period.

Air Traffic Control Staffing and Modernization

Section 100008 would appropriate $12.5 billion for the FAA to construct, acquire, improve, and operate various facilities and equipment as follows:

$7.8 billion for radar and telecommunications systems;

$2.2 billion for air traffic control facilities;

$1.0 billion for air traffic controller recruitment, retention, and training; and

$1.6 billion for other activities, including runway safety projects and unstaffed infrastructure.

Based on historical spending patterns for similar projects and using information from the FAA, CBO estimates that enacting this section would increase outlays by $12.0 billion over the 2025-2034 period.

John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Appropriations

Section 100009 would appropriate $257 million for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, increasing outlays by the same amount over the 2025-2034 period.

Revenues

Enacting the bill would increase revenues by $64 billion over the 2025-2034 period (see Table 2). Almost all of that would be collected in registration fees on electric and hybrid vehicles under section 100004.

Registration Fee on Motor Vehicles

Sections 100004 and 100005 would require states to collect annual registration fees of $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrid vehicles, through September 30, 2035, and to deposit those collections into the Highway Trust Fund. States would be required to remit 99 percent of the collected fees to the federal government, retaining up to 1 percent to cover administrative costs associated with collections. The Federal Highway Administration would be directed to withhold apportionments from the Highway Trust Fund for states that do not collect and remit the fees. Starting in fiscal year 2027, the withheld amount would be 125 percent of the amount required to be remitted.

CBO expects that states would generally enact the necessary legislative or administrative measures to implement and collect the required fees within a few years of enactment and would comply with the remittance requirements. Proceeds from the collections would be deposited into the Highway Trust Fund; outlays from the fund are controlled by annual obligation limitations and therefore are considered discretionary.

Indirect taxes and regulatory fees tend to reduce collections of income and payroll taxes. As a result, CBO expects that the new fee collections would be partially offset by decreases in tax receipts of about 25 percent of the gross fee collections each year. CBO estimates that enacting sections 100004 and 100005 would increase revenues, on net, by $64 billion over the 2025-2034 period.

Motor Carrier Data

Section 100006 would authorize FMCSA to charge an annual fee of $100 for access to a website that would track motor carriers’ compliance with FMCSA’s operating requirements. Under the provision, brokers and similar entities would be considered to have exercised reasonable and prudent care in engaging motor carriers if they use the website to verify a carrier’s compliance status.

When they are collected by the federal government under its sovereign authority, fees are considered revenues. CBO considers a determination that an entity has acted in a “reasonable and prudent” manner as a matter of law to be an exercise of sovereign authority, so those access fees would be considered revenues.

Based on expected participation rates, and accounting for the offset for indirect taxes, CBO estimates that the collection of access fees would increase federal revenues, on net, by $12 million over the 2025-2034 period.

Uncertainty

Many of CBO’s estimates for the budgetary effects of enacting title X are subject to uncertainty because they rely on underlying projections and other estimates that are themselves difficult to estimate.

Several areas in particular are difficult to estimate:

The amounts collected in tonnage duties under section 100003 could vary from CBO’s estimates because the volume of goods imported into the United States is uncertain. CBO also cannot predict changes in tariffs or certain other factors that would affect the volume of imported goods.

Revenues collected for registrations of electric and hybrid vehicles under section 100004 could differ from estimated amounts if states begin to collect fees more quickly or slowly than CBO expects, or if there are more or fewer registrations than expected under current law.

Pay-As-You-Go Considerations

The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. The net changes in outlays and revenues that are subject to those pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in Table 1.

Increase in Long-Term Net Direct Spending and Deficits

CBO estimates that enacting the legislation would not increase net direct spending or on‑budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2035.

Mandates

The reconciliation recommendations included in title X of the legislation would impose intergovernmental and private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). CBO estimates that the total cost of those mandates would exceed the thresholds established in UMRA for intergovernmental and private-sector mandates ($103 million and $206 million in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation).

Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Fees

Section 100004 would require the owners of electric and hybrid vehicles to remit annual registration fees, which would impose intergovernmental and private-sector mandates on the owners of those vehicles. The requirement would include some light-duty vehicles owned by state and local governments, including schools, universities, and other public entities that are subject to state registration requirements. The legislation would exclude some commercial vehicles from the fee.

CBO estimates that the cost of the mandate would exceed $10 billion each year once the policy has been fully implemented. The cost for intergovernmental entities to comply with the mandate would exceed the threshold starting in 2029 and remain above it each year through 2034. As a result of the legislation, to avoid paying the registration fees, some states could choose to modify their registration requirements for government-owned vehicles.

The section would impose an additional intergovernmental mandate by requiring states to administer and collect the fees on behalf of the federal government. States would update their registration processes unless an alternative is approved by the administrator of FMCSA. The legislation would provide a onetime grant to states to implement the policy and allow them to retain a portion of the remittances to cover administrative costs. For states unable to recover credit and debit card fees from vehicle registration remittances, CBO estimates that the requirement would result in a net loss of several million dollars in revenue each year.

Motor Carriers

Section 100006 would require FMCSA to establish a website that would provide information to brokers and similar entities on the status of a motor carrier’s compliance with FMCSA operational requirements. That provision would impose a private-sector mandate by limiting the rights of action that petitioners may make against brokers. Currently, when a motor carrier causes injuries or property damage, a petitioner may challenge whether the broker exercised due care in selecting the carrier. Under the legislation, brokers using that site will be considered to have exercised due care in selecting a motor carrier. The cost of the mandate would be any monetary damages that would not be awarded as a result. CBO cannot estimate the cost of the mandate because it would depend on the outcome of future litigation.

Coast Guard Selected Reserve

Section 100002 would expand the scope of an existing intergovernmental and private-sector mandate on employers. That section would extend the employment protections of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 to members of the Coast Guard Selected Reserve who are placed on active duty. Employers would be required to treat those reservists as furloughed employees or employees on a leave of absence, which would entitle them to any compensation or benefits otherwise available to them in that status. Upon their return from active duty, employers would be required to provide them with the same benefits, pay, and seniority as though they had not been deployed. The cost of the mandate would be the cost to employers that provide those benefits. CBO expects that each year the provision would affect 250 reservists, on average. The cost for public and private employers would be small.

This project represents a concrete commitment to the future of sustainable aviation.

After more than three years of thorough evaluation of over 20 technologies, BioD has selected the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology developed by LanzaJet, a global leader in scalable ethanol-to-SAF conversion solutions. The feasibility study will assess the technical, economic, and operational requirements to successfully and sustainably implement this technology in the country.

“This is not just theory — it’s about building the future starting today. Our commitment is to produce SAF in Colombia using agroforestry residues and energy crops eligible under CORSIA, creating a positive impact on both the local economy and the environment,” said Carolina Betancourt, Head of the Bioenergy Business Unit and project leader at BioD.

This ambitious study positions the project as a regional benchmark in Latin America to produce sustainable aviation fuels, and it marks a decisive step toward integrating SAF into Colombia’s energy matrix by 2029. The initiative supports diversification, energy transition, and the transformation toward innovative solutions for the aviation sector.

Additionally, the project aligns with Colombia’s national SAF roadmap, reinforcing the country’s strategic role in developing a productive and sustainable industry that connects rural areas with industrial transformation and social inclusion.

“This feasibility study is an important milestone for Colombia and for the growth of SAF across Latin America. We’re proud to bring our leading ATJ technology to this partnership with BioD and to support Colombia’s efforts to build a more sustainable energy future,” said Jimmy Samartzis, Chief Executive Officer of LanzaJet.

About SAF Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is an industry umbrella term that covers a range of non-conventional fuels made from a variety of biogenic and non-biogenic feedstocks and processing technologies.","Qantas, Sydney Airport and Ampol, supported by Qantas’ SAF Coalition partners, have today marked the largest ever commercial importation of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into Australia, with nearly two million litres of unblended SAF arriving this week. Sustainable Aviation Fuel has the greatest near-term potential to help decarbonise the aviation industry.

The fuel was imported by Ampol from Malaysia to its Kurnell facility on Wednesday 7 May and is currently being blended with conventional aviation fuel before testing and certification so that it can be distributed into the Sydney airport supply chain. It will then be used on flights departing from Sydney Airport over the coming weeks.

Once blended at a ratio of approximately 18%¹, the fuel could power the equivalent of 900 flights from Sydney to Auckland on Qantas and Jetstar’s 737 aircraft, reducing the resulting carbon emissions from those flights by a total estimated 3,400 tonnes². This is roughly equivalent to the annual emissions generated by 800 cars.

This import demonstrates the capability of Ampol and Sydney Airport’s existing infrastructure to handle SAF, as well as the growing momentum behind establishing the production of SAF and a viable industry in Australia, backed by the national carrier.

Qantas established the SAF Coalition in 2023 which consists of 15 leading Australian and global companies, all supporting the use of SAF at scale to help reduce their air travel and freight emissions, further demonstrating the demand for SAF that exists across industries. Air travel and freight can make up a significant part of the Coalition partners’ emissions.

If established, domestic SAF production has the potential to contribute approximately A$13B in GDP annually by 2040, while supporting nearly 13,000 jobs in the feedstock supply chain and creating 5,000 new jobs to construct and run the facilities³.

The Hon. Catherine King MP, Federal Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government said: “More than anywhere in the world, Australia has the opportunity to create new jobs, new industries and new skills through developing a domestic sustainable fuel industry – and our government is committed to providing the support to get there.

“Today’s announcement is a positive step in the right direction; a vote of confidence in the sector and a signal that demand is there.

“We made progress in our first term of government to develop a low carbon liquid fuel industry on our shores, and we look forward to building on that work as we build Australia’s future.”

The Hon. Penny Sharpe MLC, NSW Minister for Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Heritage, said: “I applaud this action to reduce emissions from the aviation industry to lay the groundwork for the net zero future of the sector.

""We want to see a strong domestic SAF industry here in NSW, which is a win-win for jobs, fuel security and the planet.”

Scott Charlton, Sydney Airport CEO, said: “Sydney Airport accounts for nearly 40 percent of Australia’s total aviation fuel uplift, so we have a big opportunity to be a leader in the development of a domestic SAF industry.

“NSW is uniquely placed to develop this industry, as a major producer of important feedstocks like canola. Most of Australia’s canola harvest currently goes offshore to be turned into biofuels by other nations.

“With the right policy settings at a state and federal level, and governments working in partnership with industry, NSW can become a global leader on SAF - creating local jobs, supporting local industry, and fuelling more sustainable flights in the future.”

Vanessa Hudson, Qantas Group CEO, said: “The creation of a domestic sustainable aviation fuel industry is key to our efforts towards the decarbonisation of aviation, increasing Australia’s fuel security and creating thousands of new jobs across our economy.

“Today’s announcement is a proud moment for Qantas and demonstrates the demand that exists for more sustainable travel. As the national carrier, we have a role to play in reducing the impact of air travel on the environment, but we can’t do it alone. We pick up 70% of our fuel in Australia so we’re looking forward to working closely with the government to chart the next course for SAF in Australia. The alignment of industry and government will be critical to establishing and scaling an industry here.”

Matthew Halliday, Ampol Managing Director and CEO, said: “This delivery marks Ampol's first major import of Sustainable Aviation Fuel into Australia and leverages our advanced supply chain infrastructure to deliver this product directly from a key domestic fuel terminal to the nation's busiest airport.

""This milestone highlights the critical role of collaboration in developing the SAF industry in Australia and demonstrates how industry can work hand-in-hand.

""This initiative is yet another step towards realising our ambition of establishing domestic renewable fuels capability at our Lytton Refinery in Brisbane.”

Mark Davies, General Manager Premium Services and International, Australia Post, said: “The SAF Coalition was established to enable large entities like Australia Post to take real and tangible action toward reducing our Scope 3 emissions, acknowledging we have a role to play in supporting the decarbonisation of transport industries.

“As Qantas’ largest domestic freight partner, we recognise the importance of driving progress across our sector. The SAF Coalition is key to advancing local sustainable aviation through cross-industry collaboration and, as a collective, we are taking meaningful action to reduce our emissions and drive the transition to a low-carbon future.”

In line with its Net Zero by 2050 ambition, Qantas is targeting 10% of its fuel use to come from Sustainable Aviation Fuel by 2030 and approximately 60% by 2050.

Qantas currently uplifts SAF from London Heathrow and is exploring opportunities at other international locations. Through its A$400m climate fund, Qantas is also backing several other SAF-focused initiatives, including planned biofuel facilities in Queensland and New Zealand, and a recently announced investment in a climate-focused VC fund.

Sydney Airport has an ambition for 50 percent of the fuel uplift at the airport by 2050 to be SAF.

Sydney Airport and Qantas extend cooperation through MoU

The importation follows the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Qantas and Sydney Airport to work together to further facilitate the development of a domestic SAF industry in Australia.

The MoU and import deal demonstrate the industry’s commitment to SAF across the supply chain – from airlines and airports to corporate customers – which can be practically used today with existing infrastructure to help reduce the emissions of Australian aviation.

Notes to Editors

The Qantas SAF Coalition is a corporate partnership program that enables companies to contribute to the incremental cost of sustainable aviation fuel purchased by Qantas via a “book-and-claim” model, thereby lowering their travel emissions and helping to scale the production and use of SAF globally. Current members include Australia Post, Accenture, ANZ, BCG, Commonwealth Bank, Deloitte, Fortescue, IMC, ING Australia, PwC Australia, Raytheon Australia, Sydney Airport, Woodside Energy, and Xero.

About SAF

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is an industry umbrella term that covers a range of non-conventional fuels made from a variety of biogenic and non-biogenic feedstocks and processing technologies. Biogenic SAF (made from feedstock such as used cooking oils and council waste etc) has the potential to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Non-biogenic SAF — or synthetic fuel / efuels — utilises carbon dioxide, green hydrogen and renewable electricity to synthesise a liquid fuel which can reduce emissions on a lifecycle basis by up to 90% compared to fossil fuels. Currently SAFs are required to be blended with fossil jet fuel up to a 50% blend limit, but the industry is expected to move towards a 100% SAF blend in the second half of this decade. With Qantas’ goal to reach net zero by 2050, it is entering into partnerships with the aim of accelerating the use of SAF across its fleet and encourage the development of a SAF industry in Australia.",https://www.sydneyairport.com.au/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-13 18:56:25.581437
