For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90 million acres — about the size of Montana — and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline.

But a growing body of research reveals that America’s obsession with corn has a steep price: The fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.

Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it.

Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when that nitrogen breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.

Agriculture accounts for more than 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide — making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.

The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol — which now consumes more than 40 percent of the U.S. corn crop — is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.

Since 2000, U.S. corn production has surged almost 50 percent, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.

Yet the environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy — and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it.

The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it.

Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn,” demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions.

At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50 billion in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.

Researchers say proven conservation steps — such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in cornfields — could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices.

Experts say it all raises a larger question: If America’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it a different way?

How corn took over America

Corn has been a staple of U.S. agriculture for centuries, first domesticated by Native Americans and later used by European immigrants as a versatile crop for food and animal feed. Its production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of America’s corn crop into ethanol.

Corn’s dominance — and the emissions that come with it — didn’t happen by accident. It was built through a high-dollar lobbying campaign that continues today.

In the late 1990s, America’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom.”

In 2001 and 2002, the federal government gave corn farmers and ethanol producers a boost — first through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bioenergy Program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 Farm Bill created programs that continue to support ethanol and other renewable energy.

Corn growers soon after mounted an all-out campaign in Washington. Their goal: persuade Congress to require gasoline to be blended with ethanol. State and national grower groups lobbied relentlessly, pitching ethanol as a way to cut greenhouse gasses, reduce oil dependence and revive rural economies.

“We got down to a couple of votes in Congress, and the corn growers were united like never before,” recalled Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying, ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you.’ I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”

Their persistence paid off. In 2005, Congress created the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that a certain amount of ethanol be blended into U.S. gasoline each year. Two years later, lawmakers expanded it further. The policy transformed the market: The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.

When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, is that more land around the world got cleared to grow corn. That, in turn, resulted in more emissions.

That lobbying brought clout. “King Corn” became a political force, courted by presidential hopefuls and protected by both parties. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55 million on lobbying and millions more on political donations, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight.

In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Major industry players — Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Cargill and ethanol giant POET among them — have poured even more into Washington, ensuring the sector’s voice remains one of the loudest in U.S. agriculture.

Now those same groups are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.

Research undercuts ethanol’s clean-fuel claims

Corn and ethanol trade groups didn’t make their officials available for interviews.

But on their websites and in their literature, they have promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel.

The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40-50 percent compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong — and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.

“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.

Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement to Floodlight that U.S. farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial,” using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint.

“Biofuel producers are making investments today that will make their products net-zero or even net negative in the next two decades,” the statement said.

But some research tells a different story.

A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the Midwest — with the same fields planted in corn year after year — carries a heavy climate cost.

Research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to expanded corn cultivation, heavier fertilizer use, worsening water pollution and increased emissions. Scientists typically convert greenhouse gasses like nitrous oxide and methane into their carbon-dioxide equivalents — or carbon intensity — so their warming impacts can be compared on the same scale.

“The carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher,” the authors concluded.

Lark’s research has been disputed by scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University and the University of Illinois, who published a formal rebuttal arguing the study relied on “questionable assumptions” and faulty modeling — a charge Lark’s team has rejected.

A 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the RFS was unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas goals because the U.S. relies predominantly on corn ethanol and produces relatively little of the cleaner, advanced biofuels made from waste.

The problem isn’t just emissions, researchers say. Corn ethanol requires millions of acres that could instead be used for food crops or more efficient energy sources. One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3 percent of the land.

“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can't solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”

Most of the country’s top crop isn’t feeding people. More than 40 percent of U.S. corn goes to ethanol. A similar amount is used to feed livestock, and just 12 percent ends up as food or in other uses.

As corn production rises, so have emissions

Globally, corn production doubled from 2000 to 2021.

That growth has been fueled by fertilizer, which emits nitrous oxide that can linger in the atmosphere for more than a century. That eats away at the ozone layer, which blocks most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.

Global emissions have soared alongside corn production. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrous oxide emissions from human activity climbed 40 percent, the Global Carbon project found.

In the United States, nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture in 2022 were equal to roughly 262 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. That’s equivalent to putting almost 56 million passenger cars on the road.

The biggest increases are coming straight from the Corn Belt.

Ethanol’s climate footprint isn’t the only concern. The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution.

According to a new report by the Alliance for the Great Lakes and Clean Wisconsin, more than 90 percent of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources — mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure.

The same analysis estimates that in 2022, farmers applied more than 16 million pounds of nitrogen beyond what crops needed, sending runoff into wells, streams and other water systems.

For families like Tyler Frye’s, that hits close to home. In 2022, Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles east of Green Bay. A free test soon afterward found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” he said.

Frye installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.

One likely culprit, he suspects, are the cornfields less than 200 yards from his home.

“Crops like corn require a lot of nitrogen,” he said. “A lot of that stuff, I assume, is getting into the well water and surface water.”

When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”

What cleaner corn could look like

Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible — but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, strips out the provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that had rewarded farmers for climate-friendly practices.

And in April, Trump’s USDA canceled the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative, a grant program designed to promote farming and forestry practices to improve soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agency said that the program’s administrative costs meant too little money was reaching farmers, while Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins dismissed it as part of the “green new scam.”

University of Iowa professor Silvia Secchi said the rollback of the Climate-Smart program has already given farmers “cold feet” about adopting conservation practices. “The impact of this has been devastating,” said Secchi, a natural resources economist who teaches at the university’s School of Earth, Environment and Sustainability.

Research shows what’s possible if farmers had support. In its recent report, the Environmental Working Group found that four proven conservation practices — including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in cornfields — could make a measurable difference.

Implementing those practices on just 4 percent of continuous corn acres across Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin would cut total greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking more than 850,000 gasoline cars off the road, EWG found.

Despite setbacks at the federal level, some farmers are already showing what a more climate-friendly Corn Belt could look like.

In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson farms 1,200 acres of corn and soybeans with her father. On 130 of those acres, she’s trying something different: She’s planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer.

“The more perennials we can have on the ground, the better it is for the climate,” she said.

Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They’ve also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” — bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer.

Under the now-canceled Climate-Smart grant program, they were supposed to receive technical assistance and about $20,000 a year to expand those practices. The grant program was terminated before they got any of the money.

“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps. Because agriculture is a high-risk occupation.”

The economics still favor business as usual. Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer.

“I think a lot of farmers around here are very allergic to trees,” she joked.

In southeast Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle, who mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres, uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller-crimping — flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs.

“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” he said.

But farmers get few government incentives to take such climate-friendly steps, Lyle said. “There is a lack of seriousness about supporting farmers to implement these new practices,” he said.

And without federal programs to offset the risk, the innovations that Lyle and Johnson are trying remain exceptions — not the norm.

Many farmers still see prairie strips or patches of trees as a waste, said Luke Gran, whose company helps Iowa farmers establish perennials.

“My eyes do not lie,” Gran said. “I have not seen extensive change to cover cropping or tillage across the broad acreage of this state that I love.”

The next corn boom?

Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for policies to boost ethanol demand.

One big priority: Pushing a bill to require that new cars are able to run on gas with more ethanol than what’s commonly sold today.

Corn and biofuel trade groups have also been pressing Democrats and Republicans in Congress for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel. While use of such “sustainable” aviation fuel still is in its early stages domestically, corn and biofuel associations have made developing a market for it a top policy priority.

Secchi, the Iowa professor, says it’s easy to see why ethanol producers are trying to expand their market: The growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.

Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based jet fuel could trigger major land-use shifts. A 2024 World Resources Institute analysis found that meeting the federal goal of 35 billion gallons of ethanol jet fuel would require about 114 million acres of corn — roughly 20 percent more corn acreage than the U.S. already plants for all purposes. That surge in demand, the authors concluded, would push up food prices and worsen hunger.

Secchi calls that scenario a climate and land-use “disaster.” Large-scale use of ethanol-based aviation fuel, she said, would mean clearing even more land and pouring on even more nitrogen fertilizer, driving up greenhouse gas emissions.

“The result,” she said, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”",https://imengine.public.prod.cdr.navigacloud.com?uuid=b10fa10b-3e95-57ea-9eb9-93aa64414521&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=60&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.78612&width=1200&height=630&x=1.0E-5&y=0.19325,N,,2025-12-28 07:11:41.158576

A deliberate rebalancing of research effort toward the mechanisms that can attract and deploy private capital at scale is needed.
Climate finance requires insights from engineering, data science, law, and sociology to understand the real-world viability and impact of investments.","DECEMBER 28 — The race to decarbonise the global economy is on. But a new study suggests the climate crisis is, at its core, a financial crisis. The staggering sums needed to transition to clean energy dwarf what governments alone can provide. The transition to a clean energy future is no longer a technological fantasy. Solar and wind are now often cheaper than fossil fuels. Electric vehicles are mainstream. So why does the transition feel so slow? The single biggest obstacle is finance. Bridging that multi-trillion-dollar gap is about rewiring the entire global industrial base — energy, transportation, agriculture, and manufacturing — all at once. This requires capital on a scale that dwarfs the Apollo programme. Governments simply do not have these sums.

The only source is private capital. Yet, the global financial system has not yet been harnessed into these critical projects. There is a mismatch between the risks of green investments and what traditional finance rewards. Building a grid-scale battery storage facility requires enormous capital today for returns that may materialise over 20-30 years. Most private investors demand quicker, more predictable returns. Investors also fear betting on the wrong solution. A fossil fuel power plant, by contrast, has a known business model. For many solutions, like sustainable aviation fuel or green steel, the cost is still higher than the dirty alternative. Who pays that premium? The market hasn’t yet figured it out, creating uncertainty for investors.

Perhaps the most perverse bottleneck is that the price of capital often fails to reflect the true cost of climate change, seen as a massive market failure. Fossil fuel investments have long enjoyed an implicit subsidy because their price does not include the colossal social and environmental costs — the healthcare bills from pollution, the disaster recovery from extreme weather, the existential threat of a destabilised climate. Because these “externalities” aren’t on the balance sheet, dirty investments can appear artificially profitable. Simultaneously, the massive systemic risk that climate change poses to the entire financial portfolio — from flooded coastal assets to collapsed agricultural supply chains — is still not accurately priced in. Investors are, in effect, making decisions with a blindfold on, unable to see the true risk of inaction. The Result? Capital continues to flow towards the old economy, effectively subsidising our own destruction, while the new economy struggles to attract funding despite being the only viable long-term path.

Solving this is requires making projects palatable for private investors. And creating new ways to bundle, securitise, and trade green assets to improve liquidity and attract different types of capital. Not to mention mandating clear, consistent climate risk disclosure so the market can finally price risk accurately. We have the technology. But without a financial system redesigned to fund it, the energy transition will remain a dream. Unleashing private capital is the only option. This has given rise to the critical field of “climate finance,” the study of how to price, allocate, and manage capital to address climate change. But is academic research keeping pace with the breakneck speed of the real-world problem? A new working paper from Matteo Gasparini of Oxford and Peter Tufano of Harvard Business School, The Evolving Academic Field of Climate Finance, delivers a startling answer: not even close.

The focus of academic literature is overwhelmingly on the role of public finance. Papers on topics like carbon pricing, green bonds, and the cost of capital for green investments are dwarfed by a preoccupation with government policy and public funding. Yes, smart public policy is an essential catalyst. But governments don’t have the balance sheets to build a global network of renewable energy plants. That capital resides in the vaults of institutional investors, asset managers, banks, and corporations. So, why the disconnect? Research on public finance often relies on established economic models and readily available data. Studying the intricate, often proprietary, mechanisms of private markets is far messier and more difficult.

A deliberate rebalancing of research effort toward the mechanisms that can attract and deploy private capital at scale is needed. Climate finance requires insights from engineering, data science, law, and sociology to understand the real-world viability and impact of investments. It requires moving beyond diagnosing the problem to designing and testing financial instruments, business models, and measurement frameworks that work. The climate crisis is the defining challenge of our time. We have mobilised scientists, and activists. But if we fail to mobilise the minds of our finest financial thinkers to tackle the problem of funding, we will lose. Academia must step out of the ivory tower and into the deal room. The future of the planet may depend not just on the technology we invent, but on the financial ingenuity we apply to deploying it.

Greener Travel in 2025 Sets a New Course for Tourism","Greener travel in 2025 gained solid momentum as global tourism embraced sustainability, responsible choice and innovative travel practices. This shift came at a pivotal moment for international tourism, with both travellers and industry stakeholders recognising that environmental stewardship must match the sector’s economic recovery. Official data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UN Tourism) shows international overnight arrivals grew by five percent through much of 2025, indicating that travel demand remained strong at a time when sustainability messages were gaining traction.

Tourism’s environmental impact has long been a concern for national governments and travel authorities. The cumulative footprint of tourism, including transport, accommodations, activities and support systems, contributes roughly eight percent of global carbon emissions, according to environmental assessments. This reality has driven policy dialogue and practical change across destinations and travel markets alike.

Sustainable Tourism Moves to Strategic Priority in 2025

The UN Tourism World Tourism Barometer also documents how destinations recovered pre‑pandemic travel volumes in 2024 and continued ascending in 2025, reinforcing that destination management must evolve to protect natural and cultural assets while meeting visitor expectations.

In response, national tourism bodies and policymakers added sustainability to core strategies guiding investment, regulation and product development. Sustainable tourism, defined by the UN as travel that addresses environmental, social and economic impacts while protecting host communities and ecosystems, became a central pillar for destination planning and marketing.

Carbon‑Neutral and Low‑Impact Travel Trends

Industry bodies and researchers identified carbon‑neutral and carbon‑negative tourism options as a key trending theme in 2025. These approaches include travellers choosing travel packages that compensate for emissions through verified initiatives or actively reduce more carbon than they emit by supporting renewable energy and ecosystem restoration projects.

In parallel, ecotourism and nature‑based travel gained traction. Travellers increasingly selected experiences that emphasise conservation, biodiversity and community benefits over mass tourism patterns. Protected forests, marine parks and wildlife corridors drew interest as places where visitor activity supports both environmental protection and local livelihoods.

Transport Choices and Cleaner Aviation

Transport remains the largest source of tourism‑related emissions, particularly aviation. Government strategies and industry dialogues in 2025 highlighted the importance of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other cleaner propulsion technologies. While adoption rates vary by country, SAF was emphasised by transport authorities as a long‑term solution for reducing carbon intensity in air travel.

Rail and other low‑emission transport modes also featured in greener travel planning. Many destinations encouraged travellers to reduce short‑haul flights when alternatives such as high‑speed trains or buses offered lower footprints and attractive scenic experiences. These choices aligned with official tourism recommendations for lowering environmental impact while enhancing visitor engagement.

Digital Tools Empower Conscious Travel

2025 saw advances in digital transparency and smart travel tools that helped travellers make informed decisions. While specific government platforms vary by country, digital solutions increasingly included carbon labelling for transport and accommodations, real‑time sustainability indicators and itineraries highlighting responsible tourism options. Official policy frameworks supported these tools as part of broader tourism digital transformation strategies.

These technologies reduced complexity in planning by enabling travellers to select eco‑friendly options without sacrificing convenience. Governments and destination marketing organisations integrated digital features into promotional portals to highlight sustainable offerings and low‑impact routes.

Community‑Centred Travel and Local Experiences

Conscious tourism in 2025 also included rising demand for community‑centred travel, where travellers opted for local homestays, guided tours by community leaders and sustainability‑oriented experiences. This trend reduces leakage from local economies and enhances cultural preservation by linking tourism revenue to community projects and conservation efforts.

Local experiences also contributed to a richer travel narrative, enabling destinations to balance environmental protection with economic inclusion. Governments woven these priorities into tourism strategy frameworks, emphasising cultural integrity alongside sustainability goals.

Strategic Policy Shifts and Global Alignment

Governments and international bodies reaffirmed the importance of embedding sustainability into long‑term tourism planning. Policy recommendations from the World Economic Forum’s sustainable travel frameworks underscore integrating environmental stewardship, heritage protection and community resilience into destination strategies worldwide.

This alignment between policy and practice indicated that greener travel was not a fleeting trend in 2025 but a structural shift shaping tourism’s future direction.

As governments refine tax credits for low carbon fuels and aviation bodies publish new guidance on how to count the benefits of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, corporate travel managers and sustainability officers say clearer, globally aligned rules could unlock far more investment and faster emissions reductions from flying.

New SAF Accounting Rules Put Corporate Travel in the Spotlight

In March 2025, the International Air Transport Association introduced a new SAF Accounting & Reporting Methodology and upgraded its CO2 Connect emissions calculator to show the impact of SAF purchases on flight emissions.

The move gives airlines and corporate customers a consistent way to reflect the carbon benefits of SAF in per passenger data, an essential step for companies that must report business travel emissions under climate targets or disclosure rules.

IATA’s approach initially spreads the emissions reduction from an airline’s total SAF use evenly across its network, so every flight receives the same percentage cut based on total SAF volumes.

Future versions are expected to allow more granular allocation along specific routes, which would give corporate clients greater flexibility to match their own SAF contributions with particular markets or travel corridors.

For global companies, this type of standardized methodology is critical. Many have adopted Science Based Targets initiative pathways that require credible, auditable accounting of aviation emissions.

Without a common rulebook, a tonne of emissions reduction from SAF can be counted in different ways depending on which airline or intermediary issues the claim, undermining trust and depressing demand from corporate buyers that might otherwise pay a premium to clean up their travel.

Tax Credit Guidance Raises the Stakes for Clear Definitions

On the policy side, the United States has been refining its incentives for low carbon fuels, including jet fuel. A temporary sustainable aviation fuel credit, known as Section 40B, took effect for fuel used after 2022 and before 2025.

It pays at least 1.25 dollars per gallon of SAF blended into jet fuel, with a supplemental amount that increases for fuels achieving more than a 50 percent lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction.

From January 1, 2025, that incentive begins to roll into a broader Clean Fuel Production Credit, Section 45Z, which offers 35 cents per gallon for SAF at its base rate and scales with the carbon intensity of the fuel.

Recent Treasury and Internal Revenue Service guidance clarifies which producers can claim the credit, what fuels qualify and how lifecycle emissions must be calculated. Separate safe harbor notices explain how models such as the 40BSAF GREET 2024 tool may be used to determine emissions reductions and to certify that fuel meets sustainability requirements.

These technical rules might appear distant from a corporate travel policy. Yet they determine which types of SAF qualify, which producers attract financing and how quickly volumes scale.

If credit rules are ambiguous or swing between models that favor different feedstocks, investors sit on the sidelines and fuel remains scarce and expensive. For multinationals trying to decarbonize their travel, that means limited availability of credible SAF options and higher costs for the limited volumes they can buy.

Book and Claim Emerges as a Bridge for Corporate Buyers

One of the most promising mechanisms to bridge SAF supply and corporate demand is the so called book and claim model. Under this approach, a company finances the use of SAF on flights it may never board, typically at a production or hub airport, and in return receives a certificate that represents the associated emissions reduction.

The actual fuel is “booked” into the aviation system and physically burned elsewhere, but the climate benefit is “claimed” by the buyer for its own reporting.

In March 2025, Airbus announced a pilot book and claim program that uses a registry managed by the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials to track SAF attributes. Several leasing companies and business aviation operators have already signed memoranda of understanding to participate.

For corporate travel, this model offers flexibility: a company whose main travel routes are not served by SAF can still finance additional production and legitimately claim the emissions reduction, if accounting rules recognize the transaction.

However, the integrity of book and claim depends on robust standards to avoid double counting. There must be clear rules about who can claim the reduction, whether multiple entities can share it and how it appears in emissions inventories.

IATA’s updated methodology begins to lay down such rules, but many observers say further alignment is needed between aviation bodies, voluntary carbon markets and national regulators before global companies can confidently rely on book and claim to shrink reported travel emissions at scale.

Corporate Climate Targets Collide With Patchwork Standards

Companies with net zero or science based climate targets are under growing pressure to reduce travel related emissions, not simply offset them with unrelated projects.

Yet in aviation, direct emissions cuts from efficiency measures and operational changes are limited; the bulk of long term reductions will depend on cleaner fuels. As a result, SAF is increasingly central to corporate decarbonization plans, especially for hard to abate long-haul travel where alternatives such as high speed rail are unavailable.

The challenge, sustainability executives say, is that accounting frameworks have not kept pace with the rapid evolution of SAF products and procurement models. Some standards classify SAF certificates as akin to energy attribute certificates, which can be counted inside a company’s Scope 3 inventory under certain conditions.

Others treat them more like carbon offsets, with different eligibility rules and disclosure requirements. The Science Based Targets initiative has signaled support for SAF as a decarbonization lever, but detailed guidance on how to claim benefits in corporate inventories is still maturing.

This patchwork leaves travel managers in a bind. If different auditors or reporting standards interpret a SAF purchase differently across regions, a company risks over or under counting its progress, or having to restate its emissions data later.

Faced with that uncertainty, some firms choose to limit SAF investments to pilot projects rather than integrating them deeply into travel programs. Clearer, harmonized rules could flip that calculation and unlock much larger volumes of demand.

Cost, Supply and the Risk of Overpromising Emissions Cuts

Even with better rules, the economics of SAF present a serious constraint. Industry analyses suggest that SAF still costs between three and five times as much as conventional jet fuel, depending on feedstock and production pathway.

A report from Boston Consulting Group in 2025 warned that SAF production is on track to fall 30 to 45 percent short of aviation’s 2030 targets, despite a more than tenfold increase in supply over the past three years.

For airlines, that price premium must be recovered somehow. Corporate customers are often the first in line. Many carriers now offer “green fare” bundles or bilateral agreements in which business clients pay extra to underwrite SAF use, in exchange for claims on associated emissions reductions.

Without consistent accounting rules, however, companies that pay those premiums may be uncertain whether they can actually count the reductions toward regulated or voluntary targets. The fear of paying twice once for the fuel, and again in reputational terms if claims are later challenged is a major barrier.

There is also a risk that poorly defined rules could enable overclaiming. If multiple parties are allowed to take credit for the same SAF volume for example, the airline, the corporate buyer and potentially a third party offset scheme the same emissions reduction could appear several times in global inventories.

That would undermine trust in SAF as a climate solution and could trigger regulatory crackdowns that chill investment. To avoid that outcome, corporate buyers are pushing for registries and certificates that can be traced, retired and audited, similar to renewable electricity tracking systems.

Regulators, Airlines and Corporates Search for a Common Language

Efforts to clarify SAF rules are gathering pace on several fronts. In addition to tax and modeling guidance from U.S. authorities, European policymakers are implementing blending mandates that require a rising share of jet fuel sold in the bloc to be sustainable over the next decade.

These mandates effectively create guaranteed demand, but they also force regulators to define precisely what counts as SAF, which feedstocks are acceptable and how lifecycle emissions are measured.

Industry bodies are trying to keep up. Beyond IATA’s emissions calculator update, standard setting organizations in sustainable finance and non financial reporting are wrestling with how to treat SAF purchases in disclosure frameworks.

Corporate travel buyers are increasingly represented in these conversations, arguing that clear, simple rules would allow them to commit to multi year offtake agreements that support new SAF plants. Without that, developers struggle to secure financing and project pipelines stall.

Some observers point to the history of renewable electricity markets as a template. There, energy attribute certificates and guarantees of origin evolved over time into robust systems that allow corporates to claim the benefits of renewable power purchases, even when electrons are not physically delivered to their facilities.

Advocates say a similar trajectory is possible for aviation, but only if stakeholders converge on compatible registry systems, verification practices and contractual terms.

What Travel Managers Can Do Now

While many of the rules are still in flux, corporate travel and sustainability teams are not entirely powerless. Experts recommend that companies start by mapping their current and projected aviation footprint, identifying the routes and carriers that contribute most to emissions.

They can then engage airlines and travel management companies to understand what SAF or book and claim options are available, and under what accounting assumptions.

Legal and finance teams, meanwhile, should follow developments in tax policy and international standards to assess which SAF purchases will hold up under audit.

Companies that operate private or charter aircraft may also have the ability to participate directly in producer level credit schemes, particularly where they can aggregate demand across multiple business units or partners.

Critically, travel managers are encouraged to be transparent with internal stakeholders about what SAF can and cannot deliver today. While it offers real and necessary emissions reductions, limited supply and evolving rules mean that SAF alone cannot neutralize all aviation emissions in the near term.

Combining demand reduction, modal shifts where possible, and targeted SAF investments aligned with emerging accounting standards is likely to be the most resilient strategy.

FAQ

Q1: What is sustainable aviation fuel and how does it reduce emissions?

SAF is jet fuel made from renewable or low carbon feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues or captured carbon. When certified under approved lifecycle models, it can deliver at least 50 percent lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional jet fuel over its full production and use cycle.

Q2: Why are clearer rules needed for corporate SAF use?

Corporate buyers need to know exactly how to count the emissions reductions from SAF in their carbon inventories and climate targets. Without clear and harmonized rules, companies risk double counting, inconsistent reporting across standards and potential challenges from auditors or regulators, which undermines confidence and limits investment.

Q3: What is book and claim in the context of SAF?

Book and claim is a system in which a company pays for SAF to be produced and used somewhere in the aviation network, then receives a certificate representing the associated emissions reduction. The company can claim that reduction for reporting, even if its own employees are not physically on the flights that burned the SAF.

Q4: How do recent U.S. tax credits influence SAF adoption?

U.S. tax credits such as the former Section 40B and the new Section 45Z lower the effective cost of producing SAF by paying producers based on the fuel’s carbon intensity. These incentives can make SAF projects financially viable and increase supply, which is essential if corporate customers are to access enough fuel to meaningfully cut travel emissions.

Q5: Are airlines already offering SAF options to corporate clients?

Yes, many airlines offer SAF based programs, ranging from green fares that bundle a small SAF contribution into ticket prices to bespoke agreements where large corporate clients co fund specific SAF volumes and receive detailed emissions accounting in return.

Q6: How expensive is SAF compared with conventional jet fuel?

Estimates vary by technology and feedstock, but SAF typically costs three to five times more than traditional jet fuel. Tax credits, mandates and corporate co funding can narrow that gap, but higher prices remain a key barrier to widespread adoption.

Q7: Can multiple parties claim the same SAF emissions reduction?

In principle they should not, but in practice this is a core concern. Without robust registries and clear rules about claim ownership and certificate retirement, there is a risk that the same emissions reduction could be reported by several parties. Emerging accounting frameworks aim to prevent this through transparent tracking systems.

Q8: How do international climate standards view SAF purchases?

Most major frameworks recognize SAF as a legitimate decarbonization tool for aviation, but they are still refining exactly how claims should be reflected in Scope 3 emissions and target progress. Companies are advised to follow evolving guidance from initiatives such as the Science Based Targets initiative and to document their assumptions clearly.

Q9: What practical steps can a travel manager take today?

Travel managers can engage with preferred airlines about SAF programs, pilot small book and claim purchases, coordinate with sustainability teams on reporting implications and update travel policies to prioritize routes and partners that offer verifiable SAF options, while also encouraging virtual meetings and low carbon alternatives where feasible.",https://thetraveler.s3.amazonaws.com/images/dusk-airport-sustainability-dashboard-refuel.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 20:12:00.822399

Er is niet genoeg frituurolie in de wereld om meer dan één dag luchtvaart te voeden.""","SAF is duurder dan gewone kerosine en dat zal waarschijnlijk voorlopig ook zo blijven, aangezien het aanbod laag is. Zo drukten grote oliemaatschappijen als Shell en BP onlangs op de rem wat betreft de productie van SAF. Ze denken er (nu) te weinig geld mee te kunnen verdienen.

De Europese Commissie sprak eerder dit jaar van een 'kip en ei-situatie'. Kort gezegd: de luchtvaart wacht tot er meer geproduceerd wordt, terwijl producenten wachten tot er meer vraag komt. Er wordt gesproken van 'marktfalen' aan de aanbodzijde van de SAF-markt.

KLM pleit daarom voor een nationaal SAF-fonds, zodat SAF sneller en goedkoper geproduceerd kan worden. De luchtvaartmaatschappij voelt zich gesterkt door het advies dat voormalig ASML-topman Peter Wennink eerder deze maand naar buiten bracht. Daarin werd Sustainable Aviation Fuel genoemd als een middel op weg naar verduurzaming van de luchtvaart. En KLM deed dus een proef. Daarover later meer.

Wat is SAF?

SAF staat voor Sustainable Aviation Fuel, duurzame vliegtuigbrandstof. Deze brandstof wordt gemaakt uit hernieuwbare energiebronnen, vooralsnog vooral gebruikt frituurvet of andere plantaardige materialen. Waterstof is op termijn wellicht ook mogelijk, maar is vooralsnog toekomstmuziek.

Luchtvaart hoeft minder biobrandstof bij te mengen na druk uit Brussel

KLM noemt het 'alternatieve vliegtuigbrandstof', omdat SAF nog steeds voor schadelijke uitstoot zorgt en dus niet volledig duurzaam is. SAF heeft volgens de luchtvaartmaatschappij wel bepaalde voordelen ten opzichte van 'traditionele' kerosine. ""Hoewel SAF tijdens de vlucht evenveel CO2 uitstoot, is de totale CO2-impact over de hele levenscyclus (van productie tot verbranding) minstens 65 procent lager.""

Daarnaast zorgt het gebruik van SAF voor minder uitstoot van schadelijke stoffen zoals fijnstof en zwavel. SAF zou daardoor gezien kunnen worden als een stap(je) op de route naar groen vliegen, voor zover dat ooit mogelijk gaat zijn. Daarom zijn er in Europa afgesproken gemaakt over het gebruik van SAF.

Bijmengverplichting

Om de luchtvaart duurzamer te maken, is afgesproken dat een deel van de door vliegmaatschappijen gebruikte brandstof SAF moet zijn. Met een mooi woord bijmengverplichting genaamd, want SAF belandt gewoon samen met kerosine in de tank van het vliegtuig.

Op dit moment gaat het om 2 procent SAF, dit percentage moet in 2050 richting de 70 procent zijn gegroeid. Het gaat om alle vluchten die vanaf Europese luchthavens vertrekken.

Maar dan moet er natuurlijk wel genoeg SAF zijn. En hier zit de crux. ""Luchtvaartmaatschappijen maken zich zorgen over de meerkosten van SAF"", zegt Bram Peerlings, onderzoeker luchtvaartverduurzaming bij Koninklijk Nederlands Lucht- en Ruimtevaartcentrum.

""Omdat de Europese bijmengverplichting voor nu nog op 2 procent staat, is de kostenimpact daarvan nog beperkt."" Doordat dit percentage toeneemt, worden de kosten voor vliegtuigmaatschappijen dus hoger. Zie hier de spagaat van luchtvaartmaatschappijen.

""Maatschappijen maken te weinig winst om die meerprijs uit eigen zak te betalen, maar zijn bezorgd dat als ze de meerkosten verrekenen in de ticketprijzen, hun passagiers overstappen naar een concurrent. Of dat ook waar is, kun je alleen maar testen"", vervolgt Peerlings.

De proef in de praktijk

En zo'n proef heeft KLM gedaan. De Nederlandse luchtvaartmaatschappij verhoogde voor vluchten in september de ticketprijzen op de routes van Amsterdam naar Londen (20 euro extra) en Hamburg (16,25 euro extra).

Shell stopt definitief met biobrandstoffenfabriek in Rotterdam

""Op deze manier wordt de bereidwilligheid van passagiers onderzocht om extra te betalen voor SAF als dit standaard in het ticket inbegrepen is"", zegt een woordvoerder van KLM tegen RTL Z. De brandstoftank op deze vluchten was overigens niet volledig gevuld met SAF. Nee, het percentage bleef 2 procent. Het ging dus echt om een gedragsproef.

Iedereen betaalt al een beetje

Goed om te weten is dat iedereen bij KLM al heel klein beetje voor SAF betaalt. Dit bedrag (tussen de 3 en 30 euro) hangt af van de bestemming en reisklasse. Peerlings verwacht dat de ticketprijzen voor alle maatschappijen zullen stijgen op het moment dat ze (verplicht of eventueel vrijwillig) meer SAF gaan bijmengen.

Daarom peilt KLM alvast wat een hogere bijdrage doet met het gedrag van passagiers. De conclusie volgens KLM: ""Een belangrijk inzicht uit de proef is dat veel passagiers nog onvoldoende weten wat SAF precies is."" Hierdoor waren de deelnemende passagiers er zich volgens KLM niet voldoende van bewust dat zij een ander ticket dan normaal kochten.

Als eerste op de hoogte van het laatste nieuws

Peerlings noemt het hoopgevend dat KLM aangeeft dat de vliegtuigen nog steeds vol zaten. ""Dat laat namelijk zien dat passagiers bereid zijn om de extra kosten voor SAF te betalen.""

""Het is daarbij wel belangrijk om te noemen dat de meerprijs voor SAF op deze kortere routes maar beperkt is én dat de routes veel zakenreizigers trekken, die vaak minder prijsgevoelig zijn. Of deze conclusies ook voor andere routes gelden, zou verder onderzoek moeten uitwijzen"", vervolgt Peerlings.

""Momenteel buigen we ons over een eventuele nieuwe proef"", zegt de woordvoerder van KLM hierover. Meer wil de luchtvaartmaatschappij er niet over kwijt.

Duurder ticket?

Of ticketprijzen zullen stijgen door SAF, daarover houdt KLM zich op ook op de vlakte. ""Een ticket bestaat natuurlijk uit meerdere componenten. Het is dus niet zo dat als SAF duurder wordt, de ticketprijs automatisch ook stijgt. Juist omdat de prijs van meerdere variabelen afhankelijk is.""

Hoe vliegtuigstrepen de aarde extra opwarmen: 'verdubbeling van opwarmend effect'

Passagiers kunnen trouwens ook nu al uit eigen beweging een SAF-bijdrage betalen. Dit wordt volgens de woordvoerder van KLM nauwelijks gedaan. ""Een half procent van de passagiers boekt vrijwillig extra SAF bij boven op het ticket."" Dit geld wordt volgens de luchtvaartmaatschappij volledig in SAF gestoken.

Rol overheid

De uitgesproken Ryanair-topman Michael O'Leary noemt SAF op dit moment een trucje en onzin. ""Tenzij overheden zich achter de productie en inkoop van duurzame vliegtuigbrandstoffen scharen"", liet hij optekenen in de Britse krant The Guardian.

Hij zegt dat ook oliegiganten op moeten staan en dat het zonder deze spelers moeilijk wordt om genoeg SAF te produceren. ""Wil je dat iedereen rondrent om verdomme frituurolie te verzamelen? Er is niet genoeg frituurolie in de wereld om meer dan één dag luchtvaart te voeden.""

KLM kijkt vooral naar het Rijk en het nieuwe kabinet. ""Alleen met een actieve rol van de overheid maken we opschaling en betaalbaarheid mogelijk"", meent CEO Marjan Rintel.

No EU-wide tax on kerosene— aviation fuel: Commercial aviation fuel is exempt from excise duties for intra-EU and international flights.

Some calls (e.g., 2019 joint statement by 9 finance ministers) for uniform passenger taxes, but not implemented.
Rates are approximate and subject to change; Many countries e.g., Spain, Netherlands, Belgium have no or minimal passenger taxes.","Germany’s Transport Minister Patrick Schnieder (CDU) has cautioned that the planned reduction in Germany’s air travel tax (Luftverkehrssteuer), set to take effect on July 1, 2026, will not automatically lead to cheaper flight tickets.

The primary goal of the tax cut is to boost the competitiveness of Germany as an aviation hub. German airports are currently handling passenger volumes at only about 90% of pre-pandemic levels, while many other European countries have exceeded those figures around 110%.

Schnieder emphasized that airlines decide their own pricing and routes, and the tax relief is meant to encourage them to maintain or expand operations in Germany rather than shifting flights elsewhere.

He told the Funke Media Group: “There is no automatic mechanism for lower ticket prices.” The head of the German Airport Association (ADV), Ralph Beisel, agreed, stating that the measure aims to strengthen Germany’s position in air travel competition, not directly lower fares.

This tax reduction reverses part of a 2024 increase introduced under the previous government. Earlier reports in 2025 suggested potential cheaper flights due to the cut, but airlines are not obligated to pass on the savings to consumers—they may use it to improve profitability or invest in routes.

This news broke amid ongoing discussions about Germany’s aviation sector lagging behind European peers. Taxation of aviation remains largely a national competence, with significant exemptions at the EU level driven by historical international agreements like the 1944 Chicago Convention and the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD, 2003/96/EC).

No EU-wide tax on kerosene— aviation fuel: Commercial aviation fuel is exempt from excise duties for intra-EU and international flights. This exemption applies across all member states, though domestic flights could theoretically be taxed none are as of late 2025.

No mandatory EU-wide ticket tax: Air passenger duties or “ticket taxes” are implemented nationally by some countries, varying widely in rates and structure. VAT on tickets: International flights are generally VAT-exempt; domestic flights may be subject to national VAT rates in some states.

Other mechanisms: Aviation emissions are addressed through the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which covers intra-EU flights and is expanding, rather than direct taxes. Proposals to introduce EU-wide kerosene taxation as part of the “Fit for 55” package (2021) have stalled due to lack of unanimous agreement in the Council.

Negotiations on revising the ETD remain blocked as of December 2025, with discussions around potential delays or exemptions for aviation fuel lasting until 2033–2045 or longer. ETD prohibits taxation except via bilateral agreements, none exist. Criticized as a subsidy worth €13–35 billion annually across the EU.

Ticket Taxes

No EU-wide harmonization; national only. Some calls (e.g., 2019 joint statement by 9 finance ministers) for uniform passenger taxes, but not implemented. VAT on international tickets exempted which aligns with international norms; domestic tickets may incur VAT in ~17 states.

EU ETS for Aviation; Applies to intra-EU flights; expanding to all departing flights. Market-based carbon pricing alternative to fuel taxes.

Several member states levy departure-based passenger taxes often distance-tiered. Rates are approximate and subject to change; Many countries e.g., Spain, Netherlands, Belgium have no or minimal passenger taxes. This patchwork creates competitive distortions, with airlines and hubs in low-tax countries benefiting.

Exemptions are seen as subsidies distorting competition with greener transport. Groups like Transport & Environment estimate a €35–47 billion annual “tax gap” if aviation were taxed like road fuels. Industry opposition: Airlines argue taxes reduce competitiveness, increase ticket prices without guaranteeing emission reductions, and duplicate ETS.

Stalled reforms: The 2021 ETD revision proposed phasing in kerosene taxes (2023–2033) with zero rates for sustainable fuels, but lacks consensus. Recent drafts suggest prolonged exemptions due to limited sustainable aviation fuel availability.

In summary, EU air travel taxation prioritizes exemptions to support connectivity and competitiveness, relying on ETS for emissions control. National variations persist, with no immediate shift toward EU-wide fuel or ticket taxes expected.",https://www.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lufthansa.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 17:11:55.295640

Kampala, Uganda | JULIUS BUSINGE | Uganda’s aviation industry is charting an ambitious growth path, underpinned by major infrastructure upgrades, strategic international partnerships, and a strong commitment to sustainable and safe air transport.

The outlook was shared during the annual Stakeholders’ Engagement Breakfast hosted by the Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA) at Imperial Royale Hotel in Kampala on Dec.16.

In a keynote address delivered by former Deputy Chief Justice Steven Kavuma, representing the Minister of State for Transport, Fred Byamukama, the government reaffirmed its support for the sector, highlighting its critical role in driving tourism, trade, and socio-economic development.

Uganda’s aviation sector is experiencing strong recovery and expansion. International passenger traffic at Entebbe International Airport from January to November 2025 reached 2.247 million, already surpassing the full-year 2024 total of 2.243 million. Cargo volumes for the same period matched the entirety of 2024.

“The January to November 2025 traffic has already surpassed the entire 2024 traffic even before adding the busy December,” noted UCAA Director General Fred K. Bamwesigye in his presentation. He attributed the growth to new routes launched by Uganda Airlines to London Gatwick, Harare, and Kinshasa, alongside new entrants such as Flynas, Fanjet Express, Malawi Airlines, and Safarilink.

Widened connectivity

Uganda has also expanded its global connectivity through Bilateral Air Service Agreements (BASAs), now holding agreements with 64 countries. Recent signings include Qatar, the Central African Republic, Latvia, and Ethiopia.

A major highlight is the soon-to-be-opened 20,000-square-meter Passenger Terminal Building at Entebbe International Airport, featuring five aerobridges, 24 new check-in counters, and 14 self-check-in kiosks. The facility will increase annual passenger capacity from 2 million to 3.5 million when opened in phases from January 2026.

Beyond Entebbe, the government is fast-tracking airport upgrades across the country to support tourism and regional connectivity. Key projects include the development of Kabalega International Airport in Hoima, Kidepo International Airport in Karamoja, and the elevation of Arua, Kasese, and Gulu airports to international status. Gulu’s upgrade is being accelerated to facilitate Uganda’s hosting of the Africa Cup of Nations in 2027.

In line with global aviation’s push toward decarbonization, Uganda is positioning itself as a regional leader in sustainable aviation. The country voluntarily joined ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) in 2019 and recently completed a feasibility study on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production.

“The study confirms that Uganda has significant potential to produce SAF using its rich biomass resources,” Bamwesigye stated. The program now moves to developing a national business case, with estimated production potential of 300–850 million liters annually.

Uganda’s election to the ICAO Council for the 2025–2028 term with 155 votes reflects its growing influence in global aviation governance. “Uganda is honoured to take up this responsibility and to contribute to advancing safe, secure, and sustainable air transport globally,” Bamwesigye said.

The sector is also advancing institutional reforms, with a roadmap now in place to separate regulatory functions from airport and air navigation service provision—a move aimed at enhancing efficiency, eliminating conflicts of interest, and aligning with international best practices.

Inadequate funding

Despite progress, challenges remain, including inadequate funding for upcountry aerodromes, land constraints at Entebbe, and growing government debt to UCAA, which stood at UGX 166.6 billion as of June 2025.

Looking ahead, Uganda plans to host major international aviation events, including the IFATCA Conference and AATO meeting in 2027, and will launch a reviewed 20-year Master Plan for Entebbe International Airport in 2026.

In his remarks delivered by Justice Kavuma, Minister Byamukama urged stakeholders to maintain high service standards. “As the Authority prepares to open the new terminal, I urge all service providers to ensure that the services they render to passengers match the revamped infrastructure.”

With sustained investment, clear regulatory vision, and a commitment to sustainability, Uganda’s aviation sector is poised to become a key engine for national and regional growth in the coming decade.",https://www.independent.co.ug/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ebb-airport-new.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 17:12:08.021154

While the airfare is covered by miles, passengers still have to pay the taxes and surcharges in cash.

You don’t notice these as much on commercial tickets because they’re baked into the total price, and airlines will usually tweak the airfare to keep the overall amount palatable. But with award tickets, the entire burden falls on the passenger, and can be substantial. If you’re redeeming a Business Class ticket on Emirates from London to Singapore, for example, you’ll pay S$1,590 in taxes and surcharges. That’s a hefty sum to pay for a “free” ticket!

Fortunately, Singapore Airlines eliminated fuel surcharges in 2017, which means you only need to worry about the airport taxes. And since these can differ significantly depending on geography, there is the potential to minimise cash payments on award tickets by choosing your departure point carefully.

In this post we’ll look at the cheapest and most expensive airports to depart from across the Singapore Airlines network.

Location, location, location

Here’s an example showing how some simple repositioning or sequencing could lead to big cash savings.

Suppose you want to visit the UK and Spain on holiday, flying into Spain, then journeying up to the UK and flying back to Singapore. As a Business Class passenger, your flight home would include a whopping S$476.42 of taxes, thanks to the UK’s notorious Air Passenger Duty.

But what if you sequenced it the other way by visiting the UK first, then heading to Spain and ultimately back to Singapore? In this case, your flight home would have just S$30.84 of taxes, a saving of nearly S$450!

⚠️ Note If you want to be technical, the flight from the UK to Spain will be subject to APD, but at a much lower rate that starts from just £13. And in any case, you can always avoid it by taking the train instead.

Taxes are usually the same regardless of cabin

Generally speaking, you will pay the same airport taxes and fees regardless of cabin.

However, exceptions apply for Hong Kong, France, the Maldives and the UK.

Y PY J F London (Heathrow) £144.79 £274.79 London (Gatwick) £114.38 £244.38 Manchester £119.07 £249.07 Paris €96.35 €176.35 Hong Kong HKD 355 HKD 425 Maldives US$100 US$240 US$480

In the UK, the Air Passenger Duty (APD) adds a significant chunk to the cost of plane tickets. For long-haul international flights, you’ll have to pay £94 in Economy, and £224 in Premium Economy, Business and First Class, on top of the other charges imposed by the airport.

In France, the Air Passenger Solidarity Tax is charged at €40 for Economy and Premium Economy passengers, and €120 for Business and First Class passengers.

In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Airport Construction Fee payable on flights to Singapore is charged at HKD 90 for Economy and Premium Economy Class passengers, and HKD 160 for Business and First Class passengers.

And in the Maldives, the Airport Service Charge and Airport Development Fee were recently hiked to US$100 for Economy and Premium Economy Class passengers, US$240 for Business Class passengers, and US$480 for First Class passengers (good thing Singapore Airlines doesn’t offer First Class to the Maldives!).

Incidentally, Singapore will soon join the ranks of countries with differentiated airport taxes by cabin class, when it introduces the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy from October 2026. This is a “green tax” which ranges from S$1 to S$41.60, depending on cabin and class of travel.

Singapore flights to be hit by sustainable aviation fuel levy from October 2026

Stopovers can add to costs

A stopover may result in higher taxes than a non-stop flight, because of the additional fees charged by the transit airport. For example, flying non-stop to Singapore from New York JFK costs US$5.60, increasing to US$29.30 if a stopover in Frankfurt is added.

Non-stop One stop New York JFK US$5.60 US$29.30

(via FRA) Barcelona €20.39 €20.39

(via MXP) Los Angeles US$5.60 US$18

(via NRT)

However, this may not always be the case. You will pay the same €20.39 when you fly from Barcelona, whether you take the non-stop or one-stop flight (via Milan).

Airport taxes within the region are generally low and below S$45, making Singapore’s S$65.20 — which will soon increase further — a relative outlier. Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines are on the lower end, while Cambodia, Hanoi and Myanmar are relatively more expensive.

Hong Kong is the priciest airport in North Asia to fly from, particularly if you’re in First or Business Class. Otherwise, the taxes in this region are fairly modest and below S$50. Japan ranges from ~S$30-40, significantly lower than the last time I compiled these figures in 2019 owing to the depreciation of the JPY.

Regardless of which airport in mainland China you fly from, you’ll pay a standard CNY90 departure tax.

Within South Asia, the Maldives takes the cake as the most expensive airport to fly from, especially if you’re in a premium cabin. The recent hikes in airport taxes, Green Tax and T-GST have made this already expensive destination even pricier to visit, and I can’t say I’m itching to return.

This is also a good time to remember that what you pay for is not necessarily what you get. Delhi’s modernised airport is generally well-regarded (Best Airport in India & South Asia according to Skytrax, if that means anything to you), and charges just under S$30 worth of taxes. Meanwhile, Dhaka charges S$104, and let’s just say the reviews are mixed (thankfully, a new terminal is supposedly opening soon).

There isn’t a lot of variability within the MENA region, with Dubai, Cape Town and Johannesburg all attracting roughly the same taxes.

From Australia & New Zealand

Airport Business Economy 🇦🇺 Darwin S$125.81 S$125.81 🇦🇺 Adelaide S$106.54 S$106.54 🇦🇺 Cairns S$100.77 S$100.77 🇦🇺 Sydney S$100.14 S$100.14 🇦🇺 Melbourne S$98.50 S$98.50 🇦🇺 Brisbane S$97.04 S$97.04 🇦🇺 Perth S$82.87 S$82.87 🇳🇿 Auckland S$46.43 S$46.43 🇳🇿 Christchurch S$39.71 S$39.71

Airport taxes are significantly lower in New Zealand than Australia, but remember, New Zealand charges international arrivals an International Visitor Levy which costs NZ$100, on top of NZ$17 for an eTA!

Moreover, if you’re planning a trans-Tasman trip, you’ll still get hit with the full amount of airport taxes when flying between Australia and New Zealand, so there’s not much reason to reposition here for the purposes of cost savings alone.

Even within Australia, there can be significant variations in taxes. It costs S$82.87 to fly from Perth, compared to S$125.81 from Darwin, a 50% difference.

It’s worth noting that Australia is one of the few countries to charge an arrivals tax for incoming passengers, which will add an extra S$22.70 to S$38.70 to the cost of your flight from Singapore (more on this later).

From Europe

Airport Business Economy 🇬🇧 London Heathrow S$476.42 S$251.03 🇬🇧 Manchester S$431.83 S$206.44 🇬🇧 London Gatwick S$423.69 S$198.31 🇫🇷 Paris S$266.73 S$145.73 🇩🇪 Frankfurt S$192.93 S$192.93 🇩🇪 Munich S$166.83 S$166.83 🇳🇱 Amsterdam S$127.32 S$127.32 🇩🇰 Copenhagen S$112.98 S$112.98 🇧🇪 Brussels S$60.86 S$60.86 🇮🇹 Rome S$60.15 S$60.15 🇨🇭 Zurich S$57.01 S$57.01 🇮🇹 Milan S$39.19 S$39.19 🇹🇷 Istanbul S$34.66 S$34.66 🇪🇸 Barcelona (via MXP) S$30.84 S$30.84 🇪🇸 Barcelona (non-stop) S$30.84 S$30.84

Europe is a classic example of how repositioning can result in big savings. And unlike other regions, it can often make practical sense, since tourists frequently visit multiple countries on a single trip, and intra-Europe flights/train rides are relatively affordable.

We’ve already seen the big disparity between the UK and Spain, but other (relatively) low-cost places to originate from include Turkey, Italy and surprisingly, Switzerland. France, Germany, Netherlands and Denmark are significantly more expensive, so try to fly into these destinations rather than out of them.

From USA

There’s not a lot to say here, because the taxes for award tickets on non-stop flights from the USA are all the same at US$5.60 (S$7.19).

The only time a difference will arise is if you’re taking the one-stop flights from LAX (transit NRT) and JFK (transit FRA).

Using the ITA Matrix to check taxes

If you want to check the most up-to-date taxes for your flight, you can do so via the ITA Matrix. This flight search engine shows a detailed breakdown of the taxes on a ticket, and which country they’re attributable to.

Do note that you may see “carrier-imposed surcharge” (YR) on certain Singapore Airlines flights. This is not imposed on award redemptions, so you can safely ignore it.

Also, the taxes shown on the ITA Matrix will not be accurate for award tickets in the following countries.

Country Remarks 🇺🇸 United States

(Inbound) International Arrival Tax is not charged on award bookings

(Outbound) Passenger Facility Charge and International Departure Tax are not charged on award bookings

🇮🇳 India

(Outbound) India Goods and Services Tax is a percentage of ticket cost and varies by cabin. It is not charged on award bookings as no cash is paid towards the fare component

🇵🇭 Philippines

(Outbound) Philippines Travel Tax does not apply to foreign passport holders staying for <1 year (and selected other groups). ITA Matrix still displays this nonetheless

To see the actual taxes payable for these destinations, you’ll need to make a dummy booking on the Singapore Airlines website.

What about flying out of Singapore?

The standard taxes on a one-way award flight departing from Singapore are currently set at S$65.20. This will increase over the next few years to S$79.20 by April 2030, as part of plans to hike airline and passenger fees to finance a S$3 billion airport investment.

As mentioned earlier, there will also be the SAF levy to contend with for departures from October 2026, which will add an additional S$1 to S$41.60 to the figures above.

Conclusion

While award tickets save you from having to pay the airfare, you’re still on the hook for taxes and surcharges. Depending on where you’re flying from, these can either be a mild inconvenience, or reason enough to rejig your travel plans. Since most taxes are charged to departing passengers, the general rule should be that you fly into expensive airports, and out from cheaper ones.

Unfortunately, Singapore is fast becoming one of the more expensive airports to fly out from, not just within Southeast Asia, but within Asia Pacific in general. That will only get worse with the new SAF levy, especially for those travelling in premium cabins on long-haul flights.",https://milelion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/haneda-airport.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 17:12:13.032018

As we move toward 2026, flying is set to undergo some of its most noticeable transformations in decades. From biometric boarding to greener aircraft and redesigned cabins, the way passengers experience air travel is evolving rapidly. What once felt futuristic is becoming routine, and 2026 is expected to mark a turning point in how we fly.

Biometric Travel Will Become the New Normal

One of the biggest changes passengers will notice in 2026 is the widespread use of biometric identification. Facial recognition, already in use at select airports, will become standard for check-in, security, and boarding.

Instead of presenting passports and boarding passes multiple times, travelers will simply walk through checkpoints where cameras verify their identity in seconds. This will reduce queues, speed up boarding, and minimize physical contact—something travelers now value more than ever.

Airports aim to become “walk-through” experiences, where your face becomes your boarding pass.

Shorter Airport Wait Times Through AI and Automation

Artificial intelligence will play a major role in reducing delays. AI-powered systems will predict congestion, adjust staff deployment, and optimize flight schedules in real time. Security scanners will become smarter, requiring fewer manual checks while maintaining safety standards.

Robotic assistants may also appear more frequently—guiding passengers, answering questions, and even helping with luggage in large terminals. For frequent flyers, this means less stress and more predictability.

Greener Aircraft and Sustainable Flying

Sustainability is no longer optional for the aviation industry. By 2026, airlines are expected to significantly increase their use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

Newer aircraft models will be lighter, quieter, and more fuel-efficient. Some airlines may begin limited electric or hybrid-electric flights on short regional routes. While fully electric long-haul flights are still years away, 2026 will represent a major step toward eco-conscious aviation.

Passengers may also see carbon-footprint labels on tickets, allowing them to make more informed travel choices.

Cabin Design Will Focus on Comfort and Personal Space

The days of one-size-fits-all cabin layouts are fading. In 2026, aircraft interiors will prioritize ergonomics, hygiene, and personalization.

Seats will feature better lumbar support, adjustable headrests, and smart cushions that adapt to body movement. Improved air filtration systems will enhance cabin air quality, while antimicrobial materials will become standard on high-touch surfaces.

Economy class may see subtle but meaningful upgrades, while premium cabins will offer more privacy through sliding doors and quieter spaces—even on mid-range flights.

In-Flight Entertainment Will Be Personalized

Seatback screens will no longer be the primary entertainment source. Instead, airlines will integrate personal device streaming, allowing passengers to watch content on their own phones, tablets, or laptops.

AI-driven systems will recommend movies, music, and even destination tips based on passenger preferences. High-speed satellite Wi-Fi will become more reliable, enabling video calls, live streaming, and remote work at 35,000 feet.

For business travelers, flights in 2026 may feel more like mobile offices than downtime.

Faster, More Flexible Booking and Pricing

Dynamic pricing powered by AI will allow airlines to offer more personalized fares. Ticket prices may vary not just by demand, but by loyalty status, travel history, and flexibility preferences.

Passengers will also enjoy more modular booking options—paying only for what they need. Want extra legroom but no checked baggage? Prefer flexible dates but basic seating? By 2026, customization will be key.

Health and Wellness Will Matter More

Airlines are paying closer attention to passenger well-being. Expect better cabin lighting to reduce jet lag, healthier in-flight meals, and hydration-focused services on long-haul routes.

Some airlines may introduce quiet zones or wellness-focused seating areas, acknowledging the growing demand for mindful travel experiences.

Conclusion: Flying in 2026 Will Feel Smarter, Not Just Faster

Traveling by plane in 2026 won’t just be about reaching a destination—it will be about how smoothly, responsibly, and comfortably you get there. Technology will reduce friction, sustainability will guide decisions, and personalization will shape every stage of the journey.

While the romance of flying remains, the experience itself is becoming more human-centered. In many ways, the future of air travel isn’t about machines—it’s about making flying work better for people.

As these changes take flight, passengers can expect a journey that feels less like a hassle and more like a seamless part of modern life.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/694f8ec13a9508001ec547e5.jpg",N,,2025-12-27 19:56:20.061234

Meskipun pembakaran SAF juga menghasilkan karbon dioksida, emisi agregat di seluruh rantai produksi (dari bahan baku hingga penggunaan) hampir 80% lebih rendah daripada bahan bakar jet konvensional.

Sementara produksi SAF global saat ini diperkirakan sekitar 2 juta ton per tahun, perusahaan-perusahaan besar memperkirakan akan meningkatkan produksi SAF menjadi 500 juta ton pada tahun 2050.

Minyak nabati bekas pakai dianggap sebagai salah satu bahan baku yang paling mudah diakses dan menarik secara ekonomi untuk SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel). Harganya lebih murah daripada bahan baku minyak bumi; pasar global untuk minyak nabati diperkirakan sekitar $7 miliar.

Airline SAF Targets Under Pressure The slow expansion of SAF production is already forcing airlines to reconsider their climate commitments.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has released updated estimates for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, revealing a mixed picture for aviation’s decarbonisation efforts.

Global SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (2.4 billion litres) in 2025, nearly double the 1 million tonnes produced in 2024.

However, growth is projected to slow in 2026, with production rising to just 2.4 million tonnes, highlighting the challenges facing scale-up. Even at these levels, SAF will account for only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, inching up to 0.8% in 2026—far short of what is needed to meaningfully cut aviation emissions.

High Costs and Weak Policy Support Stall Momentum

IATA has revised its 2025 SAF outlook downward from earlier forecasts, citing insufficient and poorly designed policy support. Despite installed production capacity, SAF output has failed to accelerate due to a lack of effective incentives.

At current prices, SAF costs around twice as much as conventional jet fuel, and in markets with mandates, prices can rise to five times higher. For airlines, this translates into an additional USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs in 2025 alone.

“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. “But if the objective is to scale SAF production and decarbonise aviation, then regulators must rethink their approach.”

EU and UK Mandates: Rising Prices, Limited Supply

According to IATA, SAF mandates in Europe and the UK have failed to deliver the intended boost to production and adoption.

Under the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation framework, airlines face sharply higher costs amid limited SAF supply and concentrated fuel markets. In some cases, airlines are paying up to five times the cost of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF, without guaranteed supply or consistent certification.

Similarly, the UK’s SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the financial burden. In total, airlines paid a USD 2.9 billion premium for the limited SAF available in 2025—of which USD 1.4 billion reflects the standard SAF price gap over fossil fuel.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment and undermine efforts to scale SAF,” Walsh warned, calling for urgent course correction beyond policy announcements.

Airline SAF Targets Under Pressure

The slow expansion of SAF production is already forcing airlines to reconsider their climate commitments. Many carriers that pledged to use 10% SAF by 2030 may be unable to meet those targets due to supply constraints.

“These commitments were made in good faith,” Walsh said, “but SAF is simply not being produced in sufficient quantities to deliver on that ambition.”

The Risk of Repeating Mistakes with e-SAF

Looking ahead, IATA has cautioned regulators against repeating the same errors as e-SAF mandates approach—scheduled for 2028 in the UK and 2030 in the EU.

E-SAF faces an even steeper cost challenge, with prices potentially up to 12 times higher than conventional jet fuel. Without strong production incentives, IATA warns that supply will fall well short of targets, potentially pushing compliance costs to EUR 29 billion by 2032.

“Current policies are clearly not delivering the desired outcomes,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist. “Mandates have driven up costs and constrained supply. Repeating the same approach with e-SAF would be a serious mistake.”

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect.","The Voice of Chandigarh | Travel Trade Reporter

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released new estimates for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production showing that:

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (Mt) (2.4 billion liters), double the 1 Mt produced in 2024. However, in 2026, SAF production growth is projected to slow down and reach 2.4 Mt.

SAF production in 2025 represents only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption, increasing to 0.8% the following year. At current price levels, the SAF premium translates into an additional USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs for the industry in 2025.

The estimated SAF output for 2025 of 1.9 Mt is a downward revision from IATA’s earlier forecasts due to lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities. SAF prices exceed fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to a factor of five in mandated markets.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonization of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

The Negative Effects of EU & UK SAF Mandates

Mandates in the EU and UK have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption:

In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have widened their profit margins to such an extent that airlines pay up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF. All this comes without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation.

The UK’s SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden.

The cumulative impact of poorly designed policy frameworks is that airlines paid a premium of USD 2.9 billion for the limited 1.9 Mt of SAF available in 2025. Of this, USD 1.4 billion reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional fuel.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognize that its approach is not working and urgently correct course. The recent European Commission STIP announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter,” said Walsh.

The failure to accelerate the expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets. “Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10% SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” said Walsh.

Looking Ahead to e-SAF Mandates

With e-SAF mandates approaching in the UK (2028) and EU (2030), it’s essential not to repeat the policy missteps seen with SAF.

Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel. Without strong production incentives (as opposed to mandates), supply will fall short of targets. On top of that, compliance costs could escalate to EUR 29 billion by 2032 if targets aren’t met, as seems very likely with the current policy framework.

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect. Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down. Mandates have done just the opposite, and it is outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist.",https://thevoiceofchandigarh.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/fuel-200x200.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 11:56:47.994840

While people still sought holidays, new experiences, and memorable photos, there was a noticeable shift in the way travelers approached their trips. As the world faced increasingly severe climate events like heatwaves and floods, travelers began to prioritize sustainability over convenience. Climate awareness grew louder, and more people began to consider the environmental impact of their travel choices. What once was a buzzword, sustainability became a deciding factor for travelers when booking flights, choosing accommodations, and planning their activities.

In 2025, the mindset surrounding travel began to change quietly but significantly. The conversation shifted from where should I go to how can I travel responsibly? This article highlights how greener travel practices have emerged as the new norm in 2025 and the pivotal changes that marked this shift toward sustainable travel.

The Personal Shift: Why Travelers Began to Care More

In 2025, climate conversations felt more personal than ever before. Global environmental changes, including heatwaves, floods, and unpredictable weather, made it clear how much human activities—including tourism—affect the planet. Reports from organizations like the UN World Tourism Organization and the World Economic Forum highlighted the tourism sector’s carbon footprint, and this led many travelers to pay attention.

Rather than simply asking where should I go, travelers increasingly began to question, how can I travel responsibly? This question signified a turning point in the travel industry. It marked the moment when conscious travel became mainstream, no longer confined to niche eco-travel groups. More people started considering their travel choices and how they could reduce their environmental impact.

Slow Travel: A Key Trend of 2025

One of the most significant changes in 2025 was the rise of slow travel. Travelers, instead of rushing through several cities in a short period, began opting for longer stays in one destination. Slow travel emphasizes quality experiences over quantity, and it allows travelers to better understand and immerse themselves in local culture and nature.

This trend was largely driven by the increasing desire to minimize carbon footprints and enjoy meaningful experiences without the haste of ticking off items on a travel list. As part of this shift, train journeys became especially popular, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia. Trains are known for their lower emissions compared to flights, and they also offer scenic views, making the journey itself part of the travel experience.

Night trains and long-distance rail travel were marketed as experiences rather than compromises, and many travelers embraced this sustainable option for both leisure and transportation. Studies from the European Environment Agency consistently show that train travel produces far fewer emissions than flying, and in 2025, more people began to listen and incorporate this sustainable choice into their travels.

Hotels Going Beyond Towel Reuse: Sustainability in Accommodations

In 2025, sustainable hotels began to move past the basic “reuse your towel” sign. Eco-certifications like Green Key and LEED became more prominent, and hotels made them front and center in their marketing. The trend toward sustainability led to refillable toiletry stations replacing tiny plastic shampoo bottles, and hotels worked to reduce single-use plastics wherever possible.

Boutique accommodations embraced local sourcing, from furniture made by local artisans to farm-to-table menus that emphasized fresh, locally grown produce. These small changes helped reduce waste, lowered the carbon footprint of travel, and supported local communities. In 2025, travelers increasingly chose accommodations based on their environmental practices, ensuring their stays aligned with their values of sustainability and responsible travel.

Flights Getting Cleaner: Aviation’s Shift Toward Sustainability

Aviation is one of the largest contributors to travel-related emissions, but 2025 saw significant strides in making air travel more sustainable. Many airlines began to incorporate Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into their operations, which can significantly reduce carbon emissions compared to traditional jet fuel.

Reports from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and other industry leaders show that airlines also invested in fuel-efficient aircraft that burn less fuel per passenger. This shift was complemented by the increased availability of carbon offset programs, which encouraged travelers to take responsibility for their emissions by contributing to forest restoration and renewable energy projects. Travelers were given the opportunity to offset their flight’s emissions at the time of booking, increasing awareness of the true cost of flying.

Community-Based Travel Gains Popularity

Community-based travel became a major trend in 2025 as travelers sought out more authentic experiences that benefited local communities. Rather than staying in large hotel chains, more travelers opted for homestays, local tours, and experiences run by locals. According to data from Booking.com and Airbnb, searches for accommodations that benefited local communities saw significant growth. This form of tourism helped ensure that money stayed within communities, traditions were respected, and tourism was less extractive and more meaningful.

By choosing local businesses, travelers contributed directly to the well-being of the communities they visited, helping to sustain cultural heritage and support the local economy. This form of travel, which places an emphasis on cultural exchange and community support, became increasingly important in 2025.

Technology Helping Travelers Make Greener Choices

In 2025, technology played a critical role in helping travelers make more informed choices about their trips. Many travel platforms and apps provided carbon impact labels for flights and accommodations, allowing travelers to compare the environmental footprint of their options. Apps also made it easier for travelers to find sustainable hotels, public transport routes, and low-impact activities.

These platforms provided data-backed transparency, empowering travelers to make responsible decisions without feeling overwhelmed. With the rise of eco-consciousness in the travel sector, these tools helped travelers take action toward more sustainable journeys.

Conclusion: Sustainable Travel is Here to Stay

In 2025, the travel industry made significant strides toward sustainability, with greener choices becoming the norm rather than the exception. From slow travel and sustainable accommodations to cleaner flights and community-based tourism, travelers and industry leaders alike embraced the idea that tourism must coexist with nature and local cultures.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-105.png,N,,2025-12-27 09:56:28.985740

Travel in 2025 came with a very different mindset. People still wanted holidays, photos, and new experiences — but they also wanted cleaner air, lighter footprints, and fewer guilt pangs while booking that flight. Sustainability stopped being a buzzword and quietly became a deciding factor. From airlines to hotels to the way travellers planned their trips, travel truly began to think greener. Here’s how travel slowly changed course in 2025.

Why Travellers Started Caring More

One of the biggest changes was how people travelled, not just where. Slow travel became a preferred choice. Instead of rushing through five cities in seven days, travellers stayed longer in one place. Train journeys gained popularity, especially in Europe and parts of Asia. Train journeys offer both lower emissions and scenic routes that travellers loved. Night trains and long-distance rail travel were marketed as experiences rather than compromises. Studies by the European Environment Agency consistently show trains produce far fewer emissions than flights — and travellers finally listened.

Hotels Went Beyond Towel Reuse

In 2025, sustainable hotels moved past the old “reuse your towel” sign. They leaned into eco-certifications like Green Key and LEED, and made those badges front and center for guests. No more tiny plastic shampoo bottles—hotels swapped in refillable toiletry stations and cut down single-use plastics wherever they could. Many boutique stays highlighted local sourcing — from furniture made by local artisans to farm-to-table menus.

Aviation has always been a big source of travel-related emissions, but 2025 saw visible efforts to improve. Many airlines expanded the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can cut carbon emissions significantly compared to regular jet fuel. According to IATA and industry reports, airlines also invested in newer, fuel-efficient aircraft that burn less fuel per passenger. Carbon offset options were no longer hidden at checkout. Travellers were encouraged to offset emissions by supporting forest restoration and renewable energy projects, making people more aware of the real cost of flying.

As the first of 32 on order via lessor AerCap, the aircraft signifies the airline’s strategic shift to mainline narrowbody operations. It is scheduled to enter service on the Bangkok-Singapore route from January 22, 2026.

Eco-Performance Redefined

The new A321neo offers major efficiency gains. Its advanced CFM LEAP-1A engines cut fuel use by up to 20%, lowering CO₂ emissions per seat. This directly reduces operating costs on competitive regional routes.

The aircraft also supports sustainable travel. It is certified to use up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This aligns with Thai Airways’ environmental goals, helping the airline meet stricter aviation regulations.

Inside the A321neo: Where Hospitality Meets Design

The new cabin is configured for 175 passengers. It features 16 flat-bed seats in Royal Silk Business Class. This offers a widebody-style experience on regional flights.

Economy Class includes 159 seats with comfort-focused design. They have adjustable headrests and a 110-degree recline, and each passenger gets a personal 4K touchscreen with Bluetooth.

The cabin also includes Airspace XL overhead bins for more storage. Dynamic mood lighting completes the space, blending modern design with Thai motifs.

Locking onto Regional Growth

The A321neo’s efficiency gives Thai Airways new network flexibility. The airline can now better serve busy regional routes across Asia. This market is key for its recovery and growth.

This fleet renewal is a strategic statement.

The fight to protect livelihoods isn’t just about markets and margins, it’s also about mental health and the well-being of farm families.
Brad Olson is President of the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation","Farmers faced a year of tight margins, falling markets and rising costs in 2025. These pressures aren’t just economic; they’re taking a toll on farmer’s mental health, as well. The farm economy isn’t something we simply live with anymore; it’s becoming a crisis that weighs on families and communities. Yet farmers kept moving forward planting, harvesting, advocating and sustaining rural life.

In light of the pain points, this year delivered bright spots worth noting both in Wisconsin Farm Bureau and across Wisconsin agriculture.

Wisconsin Farm Bureau earned national recognition, bringing home the New Horizon Award for Gather Wisconsin and the Pinnacle Award, the highest honor from American Farm Bureau Federation. These achievements reflect the strength of organized agriculture and its ability to connect farmers with consumers and policymakers.

Membership surpassed 53,000 for the first time since 1993. That momentum came from grassroots efforts proving that collective action has an impact.

There were several policy wins for farmers worth noting this year, as well. With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Dairy Margin Coverage eligibility increased to 6 million pounds, offering better protection for milk producers. A biannual cost survey for cheese processors will improve transparency in make allowance calculations, and reference prices rose to $10.00 for soybeans and $4.10 for corn. Livestock producers secured full reimbursement for predation losses, and the Market Access Program received $400 million to expand global marketing opportunities.

Two major policy wins at the end of this year reinforce the connection between agriculture and everyday life. The Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act passed with strong bipartisan support, restoring the option for schools to serve whole milk. This change reflects years of advocacy by farmers who know the nutritional value of milk and the importance of giving students access to the products Wisconsin is proud to produce.

Another milestone came recently with the passage of the Pet and Livestock Protection Act in the House. This legislation is an important step toward restoring common-sense wildlife management and providing certainty for rural communities that have lived with the consequences of a growing wolf population for far too long. Both of these measures show what can happen when grassroots voices and legislative action align.

At the state level, the budget supported rural infrastructure, processing capacity, conservation and farmer wellness. The Agricultural Road Improvement Program returned with $150 million for roads and bridges, reinforcing the importance of safe and reliable transportation for farm products.

Grassroots advocacy proved its strength when proposed fee hikes for markets and trucking were rolled back after nearly 600 comments from farmers.

While there is plenty to celebrate, there are still persistent challenges that need to be recognized in farming.

Commodity prices remained under pressure from heavy carryover stocks and weaker export demand. Fertilizer and equipment costs stayed high, and interest rates pushed borrowing costs upward. Analysts estimate U.S. farmers will lose $15 billion selling this year’s corn, with combined crop losses reaching $54 billion over the past three years. These numbers reflect a trend that weighs heavily on farm profitability and long-term sustainability.

Health care coverage continues to be one of the most persistent challenges for farm families. Rising premiums and limited rural provider networks make affordable options hard to find. Many farmers are self-employed, which often means paying for individual plans with high deductibles or going without coverage altogether. In some cases, families rely on off-farm employment just to access insurance, creating added stress and financial strain through the form of daycare expenses and additional farm labor.

These realities highlight the need for health plans tailored to agriculture, which is why Wisconsin Farm Bureau is currently advocating for legislation that would allow us to offer Farm Bureau Health Plans for our members.

The financial strains in farming have also amplified mental health concerns. DATCP’s Farm Center reported record call volumes and doubled its client load in September. While sobering, these figures show progress as more farmers are reaching out for help rather than suffering in silence. To help farmers get acclimated with mental health resources, Wisconsin Farm Bureau’s Farm Neighbors Care Program distributed over 12,000 stickers, wallet cards and wristbands in the past year to remind farmers that support is available and that no one faces these challenges alone.

The coming year will demand resilience and collaboration. Stabilizing trade relationships and expanding domestic markets remain priorities, with opportunities emerging in biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel. Continued engagement with policymakers will be essential to secure fair pricing, sensible regulations and strong safety nets for farmers.

Wisconsin agriculture has proven its strength through adversity, but resilience comes at a cost. The fight to protect livelihoods isn’t just about markets and margins, it’s also about mental health and the well-being of farm families. Every conversation matters. Every check-in matters.

When farmers unite, whether to push back on harmful regulations, advocate for better policies or simply support one another, they do more than survive tough seasons. They build a future where farming is sustainable for both the land and the people who care for it.

The challenges ahead are real, but so is the determination to keep moving forward together.

Ensuring universal access to clean cooking fuel remained central. Under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, beneficiary coverage reached about 10.35 crore households by December 1, 2025. To clear pending applications and move towards saturation, the government approved the release of 25 lakh additional LPG connections in FY 2025-26. The eligibility process was simplified through a single Deprivation Declaration, replacing the earlier multi-point system.

Targeted subsidies of ₹300 per 14.2 kg cylinder for up to nine refills annually for PMUY beneficiaries supported affordability. This translated into rising usage, with average per capita LPG consumption increasing from about three refills in 2019-20 to 4.47 refills in FY 2024-25, and further to a pro-rated 4.85 refills per annum in FY 2025-26.

Subsidy targeting and transparency were strengthened through expanded biometric Aadhaar authentication, covering 71 per cent of PMUY consumers and 62 per cent of non-PMUY consumers by December 2025. A nationwide drive launched in November enabled free mobile-based authentication.

Consumer safety remained a focus. More than 12.12 crore free basic safety checks were conducted at customer premises, while 4.65 crore LPG hoses were replaced at discounted rates during the year.

Fuel retail infrastructure also expanded. Over 90,000 retail outlets were enabled with digital payments, supported by 2.71 lakh POS terminals, while more than 3,200 bowsers improved door-to-door delivery in remote areas. Toilet facilities were ensured at nearly all outlets under the Swachh Bharat Mission.

""Turning everyday trash into jet fuel could be an innovative but major near-term step toward cleaner aviation.
By converting municipal waste into low-carbon jet fuel that already works in today's engines, we can start cutting emissions immediately, without waiting for future technology.""
First, it would reduce air pollution by 80-90% compared with traditional aviation fuel.
""Efficiency could be improved by capturing carbon dioxide or adding green hydrogen, produced with renewable power, during processing,"" Space Daily stated.","As the booming airline industry looks for ways to reduce its impact on the planet, researchers revealed that sustainable aviation fuel could be produced from municipal solid waste.

The study, published in Nature Sustainability, said such a program could meet 28% of global jet fuel demand and lessen air pollution by 16%, Space Daily reported.

Sustainable aviation fuel, which the outlet described as ""a low-carbon alternative made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and crops,"" is not the only way innovators are looking to revamp environmentally costly flights. One group is turning back the clock with a propeller design to reduce fuel burn, and another is transforming microalgae into biofuel.

Still, less than 1% of global jet fuel use comes from sustainable fuels, Space Daily noted, adding that aviation accounts for 2.5% of worldwide pollution and that air travel will double by 2040. (Other options are plentiful.)

""Unlike road transport, which is quickly shifting toward electrification, there's no silver-bullet solution for achieving carbon-neutral aviation,"" first author Jingran Zhang said. ""Turning everyday trash into jet fuel could be an innovative but major near-term step toward cleaner aviation. By converting municipal waste into low-carbon jet fuel that already works in today's engines, we can start cutting emissions immediately, without waiting for future technology.""

Turning trash into fuel would have major benefits. First, it would reduce air pollution by 80-90% compared with traditional aviation fuel. It would also convert plastic, metal, and other garbage into an important product, replacing the need to store those unwanted goods in landfills or burn them. That would produce clean energy, herald the arrival of zero-waste goals, lessen pollution, and conserve land, according to Space Daily.

One problem with the idea is that only one-third of the trash was converted into fuel due to ""gas composition mismatches,"" the website pointed out. The researchers said adding carbon dioxide or green hydrogen to the mix would boost the effort.

""Efficiency could be improved by capturing carbon dioxide or adding green hydrogen, produced with renewable power, during processing,"" Space Daily stated.

The economic benefits would include savings for airlines that already gain from government incentives and subsidies that encourage the use of more environmentally friendly fuels. The United States and Europe have said they will greatly reduce aviation pollution by using sustainable fuels, with the latter to move from a 2% share this year to a 70% share by 2050.

Promising new receiver-reactor concepts with multiple apertures have been proposed for high temperature solar thermochemical hydrogen production. However, limited information about suitable solar concentrator designs consisting of heliostat fields and secondary concentrators is available so far.

The goal of this study is a detailed investigation of the effect of selected solar concentrator design parameters on its performance. For a 10 MW receiver-reactor the number of subfields and corresponding apertures is varied in combination with the receiver height above the ground, the acceptance angle of the secondary concentrator, and the design point flux density. In addition, the performance is analyzed at different power levels. The average annual performance is evaluated as well as the hourly behavior. The latter of which is important to quantify the performance of a plant with an integrated receiver-reactor.

For the heliostat field layout the program HFLCAL1 is used. Solar concentrator designs with annual average efficiencies of over 60% are identified delivering flux densities of up to 5000 suns at design point for 10 MW receivers. Instead of a joint evaluation of the solar concentrator together with a specific receiver-reactor a generic receiver-reactor surrogate model is introduced. With this surrogate model an hourly analysis of the plant performance is conducted and a parametrized correction factor is presented to derive more accurate yearly plant performance estimates.

The study provides detailed information on solar concentrators using multiple heliostat subfields and central tower systems with secondary optics, and indicates further optimization potential of solar concentrators for high-temperature receivers.

The network developed by Volotea’s base will complement the low-fare offer already provided by our airline partners operating from Montpellier,” said Emmanuel Brehmer, Chairman of the Executive Board of Montpellier Méditerranée Airport.","Volotea has announced the upcoming opening of its new base in Montpellier, its 20th in Europe and 11th in France. This represents a significant step in Volotea’s continued expansion across France and reflects the airline’s long-standing commitment to Montpellier since the launch of operations there in 2012.

A New Base and a Strengthened Offer for 2026, Serving Improved Regional Connectivity

Present in Montpellier since 2012, Volotea has offered more than 3 million seats from the airport. In 2025, the airline operates eight routes and is offering its highest-ever capacity in the region, with more than 370,000 seats.

The opening of the new base in autumn 2026 is the next step in supporting this growth and strengthening Volotea’s local presence.

The dual-airport strategy will ease pressure on the ageing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport and future-proof the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.","The inauguration of the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) on Christmas Day marks a defining moment in the long and often turbulent journey of India’s financial capital. For the first time, a metropolitan city in the country will operate with two full-fledged international airports, a distinction that places Mumbai in the league of global megacities that plan not just for today’s needs but for tomorrow’s aspirations. The new airport is a statement in steel, glass, and concrete—and also in confidence. Conceived decades ago and delayed repeatedly by land acquisition issues and environmental concerns, the NMIA has finally taken wing. Credit must go to the Adani Group for delivering the project as promised, overcoming bureaucratic inertia and logistical challenges that have stalled many such ventures in the past. In an era where deadlines are often elastic, timely delivery matters.

What had caught public imagination even before the first passengers walked through its terminals was the airport’s striking design. The giant terminal complex, shaped like a multi-petalled lotus, is both symbolic and functional. The lotus occupies a special place in Indian culture—representing purity, renewal, and continuity. In contemporary political shorthand, it is also the election symbol of the ruling BJP. While some may read political meaning into the design, the more enduring interpretation lies in its civilisational resonance and architectural elegance. Infrastructure, after all, should outlast governments and slogans. By the way, the house of worship the Bahais built in New Delhi is known more as the Lotus Temple.

Beyond aesthetics, the NMIA is unapologetically futuristic. Designed initially to handle 20 million passengers annually, it has the potential to scale up to an impressive 90 million in later phases. Smart technologies, such as 5G connectivity, real-time IoT monitoring and Digi Yatra-enabled contactless processing, place it firmly in the next generation of global airports. Its advanced Category II Instrument Landing System will allow operations even in poor visibility, a critical advantage during Mumbai’s monsoons and winter fog. Equally significant is the emphasis on sustainability. With plans for 47 MW of solar power generation, dedicated Sustainable Aviation Fuel storage and electric buses for ground connectivity, the NMIA aligns with the global push towards greener aviation. Its proximity to the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and dedicated cargo terminals positions it as a logistics hub, not merely a passenger gateway.

Politically, the airport reinforces the Modi government’s strong focus on infrastructure—airports, highways, and ports—as engines of economic growth. The dual-airport strategy will ease pressure on the ageing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport and future-proof the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. If efficiently managed and equitably integrated into the city’s transport network, the NMIA could do more than decongest Mumbai; it could redefine how India builds, connects, and imagines its urban future.",https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2025-06-30/w5l0hfev/Nanobot-1-11.jpg,N,,2025-12-26 22:11:52.564087

Universal access to clean cooking fuel remained a key focus. Under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), beneficiaries rose to about 10.35 crore as of December 1, 2025. To achieve LPG saturation, the government cleared 25 lakh additional connections for FY26 and simplified eligibility norms through a single Deprivation Declaration.

Affordability was supported by a targeted subsidy of Rs 300 per 14.2-kg LPG cylinder for up to nine refills annually for PMUY households. As a result, average per capita LPG consumption increased from about three refills in 2019-20 to 4.47 in FY25 and a pro-rated 4.85 refills in FY26, reflecting sustained adoption. Subsidy targeting improved with faster Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, covering 71 per cent of PMUY and 62 per cent of non-PMUY consumers by December 2025. A nationwide drive launched in November enabled free, mobile-based authentication.

Consumer safety also improved through over 12.12 crore free LPG safety inspections and replacement of 4.65 crore hoses at discounted rates.

Petroleum marketing infrastructure expanded significantly. More than 90,000 retail outlets now support digital payments through over 2.71 lakh POS terminals. Doorstep fuel delivery improved with over 3,200 bowsers, while nearly all outlets were equipped with toilets under Swachh Bharat norms.

Electric mobility gained momentum. Nearly 8,932 EV charging stations were installed at fuel stations under FAME-II, with oil marketing companies adding over 18,500 more. The APNA GHAR initiative progressed with over 500 truckers’ wayside amenities, enhancing road safety and rural employment.

Public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) are developing 4,000 integrated Energy Stations between 2024-25 and 2028-29, offering conventional and alternative fuels, including biofuels, CNG, LNG and EV charging. As of November 2025, 1,064 such stations were operational.

The gas-based economy saw strong progress. Operational natural gas pipelines expanded to 25,429 km by June 2025 from 15,340 km in 2014, with another 10,459 km under construction. Completion will enable a fully connected national gas grid. To reduce regional cost disparities, about 90 per cent of pipelines are now covered under the Unified Pipeline Tariff regime.

City Gas Distribution expanded to 307 areas, with PNG household connections reaching about 1.57 crore and CNG stations exceeding 8,400 by September 2025.

Revised gas allocation guidelines improved alignment with consumption patterns and reduced price volatility. Under the SATAT initiative, over 130 compressed biogas plants were commissioned by November 2025, with mandatory blending obligations beginning in FY26.

Biofuels recorded major gains, with ethanol blending in petrol averaging 19.24 per cent in 2024-25, delivering foreign exchange savings of over Rs 1.55 lakh crore and lower emissions.

Advanced biofuels progressed under the JI-VAN scheme, while Sustainable Aviation Fuel initiatives advanced with indicative blending targets set from 2027 onwards. Upstream reforms, including the Oilfields Amendment Act, 2025, led to the award of 172 exploration blocks, attracting investments of about $4.36 billion.

We’re still going to penalize you for that’?” said Richard Pan, a former state lawmaker and a member of the California Office of Health Care Affordability’s board.
The annual caps apply to a wide range of health care entities, including hospitals, medical groups, insurers and other payers.
Reduced competition Health care analysts worry the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will reduce market competition even further by stressing already weak hospitals, leading some to shut services, merge with larger health systems, or close.
That in turn could pose a challenge to state affordability regulators tasked with overseeing compliance with growth targets for health care spending.","As Congress debates whether to extend the temporary federal subsidies that have helped millions of Americans buy health coverage, a crucial underlying reality is sometimes overlooked: Those subsidies are merely a band-aid covering the often unaffordable cost of health care.

California, Massachusetts, Connecticut and five other states have set caps on health care spending in a bid to rein in the intense financial pressure felt by many families, individuals and employers who every year face increases in premiums, deductibles and other health-related expenses.

Hospitals and other health care providers are citing Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump in July, as one more reason to challenge those limits.

The law is expected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over a decade, which mathematically should help the overall health care system meet the caps. But the law is also expected to increase the number of uninsured Americans, mostly Medicaid beneficiaries, by an estimated 10 million people. Health care analysts predict hospitals and other providers will raise prices to cover the double whammy of lost Medicaid revenue and the cost of caring for an influx of newly uninsured patients.

Whether regulators in some states will allow providers to justify higher prices and exceed the spending caps is unclear. Only California and Oregon can penalize providers financially if they fail to meet targets.

“Are we going to say, ‘That’s OK’? Or are we going to say, ‘Well, you exceeded the target. We’re still going to penalize you for that’?” said Richard Pan, a former state lawmaker and a member of the California Office of Health Care Affordability’s board. “That has not yet been decided.”

The California Hospital Association, the industry’s main state lobbying group, filed a lawsuit in October asking a state court to strike down the spending caps, which it argued fail to account for all the cost pressures hospitals face. Those pressures, it said, include an aging, sicker population; the rising cost of labor; expensive advances in medical technology; large capital outlays on required seismic retrofitting; and changes in federal policy, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The hospital group’s lawsuit also asserted that the state affordability office, by hastily imposing ill-considered cost-cutting targets, was undermining its other key mission of improving health care access, quality and equity.

California’s affordability office last year set a five-year target to cap statewide spending growth, starting at 3.5 percent in 2025 and declining to 3 percent by 2029. The annual caps apply to a wide range of health care entities, including hospitals, medical groups, insurers and other payers.

Earlier this year, it imposed much lower spending growth caps — starting at 1.8 percent in 2026 and declining to 1.6 percent by 2029 — for seven “high-cost” hospitals.

“The spending caps set by politically appointed bureaucrats could force cuts that result in many Californians traveling farther for care, facing longer emergency room wait times, experiencing more overcrowding and losing access to critical services,” Carmela Coyle, the hospital association’s president and CEO, said in an October press release.

The California attorney general’s office, which will represent the affordability agency, has not yet filed a response to the hospital group’s complaint and did not respond to a request for comment.

Hospitals’ pushback

California is not the only state taking a close look at hospital prices, which are widely considered a primary driver of health care costs.

“States, armed with information that points to payments to hospitals as a driver of what is way beyond affordable commercial premiums, have begun to take increasingly targeted actions focused on commercial hospital prices,” said Michael Bailit, founder of the Needham, Massachusetts-based consultancy Bailit Health, which has advised multiple states, including California, on ways to tame health care spending. “It is not surprising that the hospital industry is going to oppose such state actions.”

In its lawsuit, the California Hospital Association said the affordability office’s own report showed that pharmaceutical and insurance companies are largely responsible for high costs.

Hospitals in some states with cost growth limits, including Connecticut and Massachusetts, have expressed objections similar to the ones raised in the California lawsuit. They could follow their counterparts in California if their lawsuit succeeds, said Peter Lee, who led California’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, Covered California, for over a decadeand is now a senior scholar at Stanford Medicine’s Clinical Excellence Research Center.

Lee said the work of California’s affordability office and similar agencies in other states is just about the only systemwide effort being made to cut health care costs. They are basically saying, “‘Look, health care is taking money away from education, it is taking money away from the environment, it is taking money away from everything in the public sector, and in the private sector it is taking money away from wages,’” he said. “‘We don’t know how you, the health system, are going to do it, but it is your job not just to provide quality but to lower costs. Here’s the target.’”

To be sure, achieving the cost savings that California and those other states are seeking is no easy lift. It will ultimately require persuading large, financially powerful players that compete fiercely for health care dollars to adopt a different mindset and begin cooperating to reduce costs instead. And that, in many cases, will mean lower revenue.

But the status quo, as many people know all too well, means continued financial pain for millions.

In early 2020, Estevan Rodriguez, a bartender at California’s Monterey Beach Hotel, had surgery for a staph infection in his leg. The bill came to nearly $168,000. His insurance paid most of it, but he still owed $5,665, which took him two years to pay, more than $200 every month. “It may not be a lot to some people, but it was a lot to me,” Rodriguez said.

He said he dropped his Hulu subscription, switched to a lower-cost cellphone, and got cheaper car insurance. He started going to food banks rather than the grocery store, he said, and had a lot less time with his kids, because he was constantly working to pay off the hospital bill.

Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, where Rodriguez had his surgery, is one of the seven hospitals identified by California’s affordability office as high-cost. A study by the office attributed high hospital prices in Monterey County to a lack of market competition “rather than higher operating costs or superior quality of care.”

The Monterey hospital referred a request for comment about its “high-cost” designation to the California Hospital Association. CHA spokesperson Jan Emerson-Shea declined to comment beyond the language of the lawsuit and Coyle’s press release statement.

Reduced competition

Health care analysts worry the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will reduce market competition even further by stressing already weak hospitals, leading some to shut services, merge with larger health systems, or close. One study estimates 338 rural hospitals are at risk of closing nationwide.

Less competition, in addition to fewer Medicaid dollars and an increase in uninsured patients, will only strengthen the incentive of health systems with the requisite market clout to raise their commercial prices, increasing premiums for employers and individuals.

“We think commercial prices will continue to increase as health care providers, and hospitals in particular, will seek to preserve or increase their revenue,” said Rachel Block, a program officer at the Milbank Memorial Fund, a foundation that focuses on health equity.

That in turn could pose a challenge to state affordability regulators tasked with overseeing compliance with growth targets for health care spending.

California’s affordability office is required to consider mitigating factors, including changes in federal and state laws. But some of its board members have expressed skepticism about letting hospitals offset Medicaid losses with higher commercial prices.

The decline in Egypt’s gas output since 2023-2024 has increased the country’s gas imports from Israel.
The slowdown in Israeli gas imports led to the freezing of gas supplies to some energy-intensive industries that normally account for 35 to 40 per cent of industrial gas consumption.
In October, Egypt and Cyprus signed two commercial agreements for transporting natural gas from the Cypriot Cronos Field to Egypt.
In the first half of December, Karim Badawi, minister of petroleum and mineral resources, attended two events, the Egypt Oil and Gas 2025 Convention and the Al-Ahram Annual Energy Conference, during which he presented developments in the sector.","Keeping air conditioners and fans running was a main concern for many people during the exceptionally hot summers that Egypt has experienced over the past three years. In 2023 and 2024, prolonged power cuts disrupted daily life, even when scheduled outages were rotated across neighbourhoods.

The blackouts stemmed from a mismatch between gas supply and demand. Most of Egypt’s power stations run on natural gas, with the sector consuming 60 per cent of the country’s supply. Rising summer demand, coupled with declining production, forced the government to resort to load shedding.

The shortfall in production was largely due to technical problems at the Zohr Field in the Mediterranean. Output from Egypt’s largest gas field fell sharply from a peak of over 2.7 bcf/d (billion cubic feet per day) to around 1.9 to 2 bcf/d in 2024. The decline transformed Egypt from a net exporter into a net importer of gas.

By 2025, the situation had improved, with electricity maintained in nearly all households during the summer months. To achieve this, the Ministry of Petroleum pursued a multi-track policy that secured energy supply year-round, especially during peak demand.

First, the government moved to secure short-term supply. It signed agreements with global suppliers to purchase 125 gas shipments annually for three to five years. The US financial service Bloomberg listed suppliers including Saudi Aramco, the Trafigura Group, Vitol Group, Hartree Partners, BGN, Shell, and Azerbaijan’s Socar.

Not all the deals were traditional imports. In February 2025, Egypt finalised a $3 billion agreement with Shell and TotalEnergies, operators of offshore Mediterranean and Western Desert fields. Gas produced locally is transferred into liquified Natural Gas after being processed in the liquefication facilities in Idku and Damietta, then either sold domestically to cover shortages or exported to Europe and other markets.

This expansion drove a 188 per cent year-on-year surge in LNG imports during the first 11 months of 2025, reaching 7.8 million tons, with full-year volumes expected at 8.5 million tons, according to CNN Business.

However, analysts expect imports to fall by at least 30 per cent in 2026 as domestic production improves and renewables gain ground.

Resorting to FSRU:Most of Egypt’s natural gas imports, excluding those from Israel, arrive by sea as LNG. To utilise these imports, Egypt leased four Floating Storage and Regasification Units (FSRUs), which convert LNG back into gas and store it until fed into the national grid.

During the summer, three units, Energos Eskimo, Energos Power, and Hoegh Galleon, operated at the SUMED and Sonker terminals in Ain Sokhna on the Red Sea, offered a combined regasification capacity of 2,250 mmcf/d (million cubic feet per day).

The Energos Winter, stationed at Damietta on the Mediterranean, added another 450 mmcf/d. Meanwhile, the Energos Force FSRU, docked at Jordan’s Aqaba Port and linked to the Arab Gas Pipeline, contributed 750 mmcf/d that can be allocated between Egypt and Jordan during emergencies.

The decline in Egypt’s gas output since 2023-2024 has increased the country’s gas imports from Israel. The Israeli option was economically accepted as it is transferred as gas not LNG via the already existing Arish-Ashdod pipeline and also costs almost half that of LNG shipments.

Israeli gas accounts for about 15 to 20 per cent of Egypt’s consumption, according to data by the Joint Organisations Data Initiative, a global collaboration by major energy organisations to collect data on global oil and gas markets.

However, different circumstances limit the dependence on imports from Israel during the year.

While Egypt was planning to increase its Israeli imports of gas by 50 per cent in mid-2024, an increase in Israeli local demand as well as planned maintenance at major fields resulted in a drop in imports during the early months of summer.

In June, during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, exports from the Leviathan Field were halted for security reasons.

The slowdown in Israeli gas imports led to the freezing of gas supplies to some energy-intensive industries that normally account for 35 to 40 per cent of industrial gas consumption.

In August, it was revealed that Egypt had extended its 2019 gas export deal with Israel until 2040. Under the deal, the Leviathan Field off Israel’s Mediterranean coast, with reserves of some 600 billion cubic metres (bcm), will sell about 130 bcm of gas to Egypt through 2040 for $35 billion.

According to Reuters, the average cost of imported LNG comes in at $13.5 per million British thermal units (Btu) excluding the cost of leasing FSRUs, compared to $7.75 for Israeli gas before the new deal. The news agency also noted that the price of the new deal might be 20 to 25 per cent higher than the $7.75 level.

However, a report by the Middle East Economic Survey, which focuses on oil and gas, noted that whatever Israel’s export capacity, the volume that Egypt can import is capped at the capacity of the Arish-Ashdod pipeline, which currently stands at 1.4 bcf/d.

According to a report by Egypt Oil and Gas, a local oil and gas platform, the Ashkelon-Arish pipeline, also known as the East Mediterranean Gas (EMG) pipeline, constructed to deliver natural gas from Egypt to Israel, has a capacity of 147 to 247 bcf/d.

In May 2023, approval was granted for the Nitzana route, a 65 km onshore pipeline that will transport Israeli natural gas to Egypt. Once operational, it will enable the export of an additional 580 mmcf/d. The pipeline will run from Israel’s southern Negev region to the Egyptian grid near Nitzana, according to Wood Mackenzie, an energy consultancy.

However, this new pipeline will not be operational until 2027.

Contrary to expectations, the deal was frozen in October, with rumours citing political reasons or disagreements between the field operators and the Israeli Ministry of Energy.

However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a Televised statement on December 18 that Israel has approved the deal describing it as the country’s largest-ever gas deal.

A MEES report on December 19, noted that Egyptians were unmoved by the Israeli PM’s initial decision to delay the gas deal due to “security concerns in Gaza and Cairo’s lack of cooperation and have been quick to pour cold water on any notions that the deal is of wider significance.”

It added that in a statement on 18 December Egypt’s State Information Service (SIS) chairman Diaa Rashwan downplayed the political significance of the deal and said that it is “a purely commercial transaction.”

CYPRUS GAS: The search for other sources of gas until local production recovers extends to Cyprus, where abundant gas reserves have been discovered and local demand is limited.

Exporting Cypriot gas to Egypt is the most economically feasible option because Egypt already has extensive existing LNG infrastructure, which avoids the massive costs and delays of building new facilities in Cyprus.

Alternatives such as constructing a Cypriot LNG terminal, building a pipeline to Greece, or exporting directly to Europe were considered but found to be more expensive, technically complex, and politically uncertain.

In October, Egypt and Cyprus signed two commercial agreements for transporting natural gas from the Cypriot Cronos Field to Egypt. The deals set out the operational and commercial frameworks governing the transportation, supply, processing, and liquefaction of the gas for export, as well as the utilisation of Egypt’s natural gas infrastructure for the project.

Cypriot gas will be transmitted to Egypt via a subsea pipeline connecting Cyprus’s offshore fields (such as Aphrodite and Cronos) directly to Egypt’s gas network and LNG plants at Idku and Damietta.

The deal is advantageous to Egypt as it will have the Right of First Refusal (ROFR), allowing it to decide whether to purchase gas liquefied in local plants or export it to Europe.

If Egypt opts to purchase the piped gas, the cost will be less than importing LNG and then changing it back to the gaseous state to pump it into the local network. Moreover, Egypt will be getting a fee for liquefying and then exporting the gas to Europe.

Shipments from Cypriot fields will start flowing in 2027.

NEW MEASURES: Egypt has also worked on dealing with various internal problems affecting gas supplies.

Part of the reason for the decline in production starting in 2023 was that Egypt, under the pressure of the then dollar crunch, had failed to pay dues to foreign partners, who in turn had become reluctant to invest in their concessions.

While there are no official figures for the value of these arrears, a search by Al-Ahram Weekly found that Egypt paid $1 billion in July 2025 followed by $500 million in September, and it was supposed to pay another $620 million before the end of the year.

Furthermore, it should pay between $250 and $350 million in the first quarter of 2026.

Another step taken to appease foreign partners was introducing a profitability factor, known as the R-Factor, in some new contracts. Traditional Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) allocate fixed percentages of production between the government and the contractor, regardless of profitability. By contrast, the newer R-Factor model makes profit-sharing dynamic: the contractor gets a larger share in the early stages (to recover costs) while the government share increases as the age of the project increases.

It also agreed with some international companies that they can export part of their shares rather than giving them to the state. Different international companies have exported six cargoes of LNG to Turkey, Greece, and Italy since the beginning of the year.

In the first half of December, Karim Badawi, minister of petroleum and mineral resources, attended two events, the Egypt Oil and Gas 2025 Convention and the Al-Ahram Annual Energy Conference, during which he presented developments in the sector.

Badawi noted that the ministry has been applying a strategy aiming at increasing upstream activities related to exploration and production in oil and gas fields. The measures have included streamlining regulations, offering investment incentives, making the bidding process transparent and easy, and commissioning seismic surveys of the offered fields.

The success of these measures was seen in the 383 new oil and gas wells that have been introduced to Egypt’s production up to October 2025.

Badawi noted that the strategy had enabled the ministry to successfully reverse the trend of declining production for the first time in four years. Moreover, the new discoveries, together with other developments, have added 190,000 barrels of crude oil and condensates and 1,100 million cubic feet of gas per day that are now flowing into the system, powering Egyptian industries and securing its energy independence.

Badawi also highlighted a plan to drill 480 new exploratory wells in five years with 101 wells assigned for 2026 alone.

At the Al-Ahram Annual Energy Conference, Badawi announced that three international companies, Eni, BP, and Arceous, have committed themselves to investing $16.7 billion in the coming five years.

He outlined the ministry’s strategy to cut fossil-fuel reliance and expand green energy investments, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), green ammonia, and bioethanol. In December, Qatar pledged $200 million for a SAF plant in Ain Sokhna, the first Qatari industrial project in the Suez Canal Zone, that is designed to convert cooking oil into SAF.

A week earlier, Egypt granted its first SAF licence to a subsidiary of the Egyptian Holding Company for Chemicals (ECHEM) to build an Alexandria facility producing 120,000 tons a year of jet fuel from used cooking oil, reducing CO2 emissions by 400,000 tons.

Badawi also noted 117 renewable energy projects at petroleum sites and efficiency measures that have cut emissions by 1.4 million tons.",https://english.ahram.org.eg/Media/News/2025/12/21/41_2025-639019500546691841-669.jpg,N,,2025-12-26 12:56:37.311503

United Airlines is eager to push Newark (EWR) as the better airport hub for New Yorkers over JFK. To promote its message, yellow cab taxi-top ads show drive-time savings.

The OOH creative is by 72andSunny and sports catchy phrases such as: ""Ready When EWR.""

The digital work is carried on nearly 800 taxis in New York to highlight Newark as the faster option. The advertising carries the cab’s exact location and ETA to the two airports.

“We loved the idea of giving New Yorkers information that’s genuinely useful as they go about their days and plan travel,” Maggie Schmerin, Chief Advertising Officer at United Airlines, told Agency Daily. “By using real-time data right on top of taxis, we can remind people that choosing Newark can save them time, in addition to connecting them to our leading global network. It’s a powerful, effective message — and we’re excited to see it moving through Manhattan.”

Important to note: United does not serve JFK. It pulled out of the JFK routes in 2015, facing stiff competition from Delta and American.

United at Newark reports it had its best operational summer ever and Newark emerged as themost on-time airport in the New York City area over the recent Thanksgiving travel rush.

United operates more than 350 daily flights to over 160 destinations worldwide from EWR. From Dec. 18 through Jan. 6, United says it will carry more than 1 million passengers through the Newark airport. The airline plans to hire more than 2,500 Newark employees between 2025-2026 and says it will be the first airline to purchase sustainable aviation fuel for use there.

For the fourth consecutive year, the Mississippi River faced historic low-water levels during the fall harvest, forcing a ""structural pivot"" in U.S. grain transport.","As the final trading days of 2025 unfold, the global agricultural commodity markets are grappling with a complex paradox: record-breaking production levels coupled with persistent logistical bottlenecks and geopolitical volatility. While American farmers have just concluded a historic harvest—bringing in a staggering 16.75 billion bushels of corn—the financial rewards remain elusive as a ""wall of supply"" from both North and South America keeps a firm lid on prices. Heading into 2026, the market is defined by a bearish-to-neutral sentiment, with traders closely monitoring the transition from U.S. bins to Brazilian fields.

The immediate implications for the market are a double-edged sword. For consumers and livestock producers, the abundance of corn, soybeans, and wheat offers a reprieve from the inflationary spikes of previous years. However, for the major agribusiness players and the American farmer, the end of 2025 is a period of tightening margins and strategic waiting. With corn prices hovering near $4.48 per bushel and soybeans struggling to maintain the $10.60 level, the industry is increasingly reliant on a rebound in export demand and clarity on domestic biofuel policies to ignite the next market rally.

Record Yields Meet Geopolitical Tremors

The 2025/2026 marketing year has been defined by the sheer scale of global output. In the United States, the corn harvest reached an average yield of 186 bushels per acre, a record that has pushed ending stocks to over 2 billion bushels despite a frantic export pace. Wheat has followed a similar trajectory of abundance, with record-breaking harvests in Canada (40 million tons) and Argentina (24 million tons) driving global ending stocks to their highest levels since 2020. This surplus has acted as a buffer against the year’s most significant geopolitical disruption: the formal collapse of the successor to the Black Sea Grain Initiative on November 26, 2025.

The timeline leading to this year-end tension began in late autumn when Russia declared the maritime corridor ""no longer viable,"" followed by a series of drone attacks on Ukrainian port infrastructure in Odesa during late December. While these events would have caused a price vertical in 2022, the 2025 market responded with only a modest ""risk premium"" in wheat futures, which climbed to roughly $5.17 per bushel. The presence of a ""US-backed peace blueprint"" currently circulating in diplomatic circles has further tempered fears, suggesting that while the physical flow of grain from the Black Sea is restricted, the global market no longer views it as an existential threat to food security.

Initial market reactions in these final weeks of December have been characterized by technical buying and ""short covering"" by hedge funds. However, the shadow of South America looms large. Brazil is currently on track for a record soybean harvest of up to 178 million metric tons, which is effectively neutralizing any bullish news coming out of the U.S. or Europe. As of December 26, the agricultural complex is in a ""wait-and-see"" mode, balancing the reality of overflowing silos against the potential for a La Niña-induced drought in the upcoming Brazilian ""safrinha"" corn season.

Corporate Divergence: Winners and Losers in a High-Supply Era

The financial performance of the industry's titans in late 2025 reveals a stark divide between those who profit from volume and those who profit from price volatility. Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE: ADM) has faced a challenging fourth quarter, significantly slashing its full-year earnings guidance. The company’s crushing subsegment saw profits plunge nearly 93% as ample global supplies crushed the ""crush margins"" that had fueled record profits in previous years. Furthermore, ADM has been hampered by ""muted demand"" for soybean oil, a direct result of the U.S. government’s deferral of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which has left the renewable diesel industry in a state of regulatory limbo.

In contrast, Bunge Global SA (NYSE: BG) has emerged as a winner in the current landscape. By successfully integrating Viterra earlier in the year, Bunge has leveraged its expanded footprint in South America to capitalize on record exports from Brazil and Argentina. While Bunge also noted the pressure of high stocks-to-use ratios, its ability to navigate global logistics allowed it to beat Q3 and Q4 earnings expectations. For these ""ABCD"" grain majors, the strategy has shifted from chasing high prices to maximizing the efficiency of their global supply chains.

The equipment and input sectors are facing their own headwinds. Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) reported a cautious outlook for 2026, projecting a significant drop in net income as high interest rates and the threat of new trade tariffs dampen farmer sentiment. Although Deere successfully cleared much of its large-tractor inventory in late 2025, the company anticipates a 15% to 20% decline in North American large ag sales. Conversely, Corteva, Inc. (NYSE: CTVA) has found success in the ""seed and tech"" space. Raising its full-year guidance, Corteva has benefited from strong demand for its high-tech seed varieties in Brazil, proving that even in a low-price environment, farmers are willing to invest in yield-protecting technology.

Biofuels, Logistics, and the ""Green"" Transition

The wider significance of the 2025 market environment lies in the shifting role of agricultural commodities as energy feedstocks. The delay in the 45Z tax credit has created a bottleneck in the transition toward Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This policy uncertainty has effectively decoupled soybean oil prices from historical norms, as refiners wait for a clear signal before committing to long-term contracts. This trend highlights a broader industry shift: corn and soybeans are no longer just food and feed; they are increasingly viewed through the lens of carbon intensity and energy policy.

Logistical challenges have also reached a critical juncture. For the fourth consecutive year, the Mississippi River faced historic low-water levels during the fall harvest, forcing a ""structural pivot"" in U.S. grain transport. With barge freight rates surging 31% in a single month, many exporters were forced to abandon the Gulf of Mexico route in favor of rail shipments to the West Coast. This logistical strain has effectively lowered the ""basis"" price that farmers receive at the local elevator, further squeezing rural incomes even as international prices remain stable.

Historically, such a prolonged period of low water on the Mississippi would have been an anomaly; in 2025, it is being treated as a ""new normal"" that requires permanent infrastructure adaptations. Meanwhile, the Panama Canal’s return to full operational capacity in late 2025 has provided a much-needed relief valve for global trade, though grain shippers now find themselves competing for slots with high-value Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and container vessels, signaling a permanent increase in the cost of moving bulk commodities.

The 2026 Horizon: Strategic Pivots and Weather Risks

Looking ahead to the first half of 2026, the market will be dominated by two factors: the South American weather and the ""2026 Separation Plan"" of industry leaders. Corteva, Inc. (NYSE: CTVA) is preparing to split into two independent public entities, a move that could trigger a wave of consolidation or restructuring across the crop protection and seed sectors. For investors, this represents a potential strategic pivot as companies seek to unlock value by decoupling their high-growth technology wings from their more cyclical chemical businesses.

Short-term opportunities may emerge if the burgeoning La Niña weather pattern disrupts Brazil’s second-crop corn. Any yield drag in South America would quickly tighten the global balance sheet, potentially sparking a rally in the March and May 2026 futures contracts. However, the long-term challenge remains the ""China Wild Card."" With Chinese port inventories of soybeans exceeding 10 million tons at the end of 2025, the world’s largest importer is under no immediate pressure to buy, giving Beijing significant leverage in ongoing trade and tariff negotiations with the United States.

Market Wrap-Up and Investor Takeaways

The end of 2025 marks a turning point for agricultural commodities. The era of ""scarcity pricing"" triggered by the 2022 invasion of Ukraine has been firmly replaced by an era of ""abundance management."" The key takeaway for the market is that while supply is plentiful, the infrastructure to move it and the policies to consume it (particularly in the biofuel sector) are currently the primary sources of friction. The market is moving forward with a heavy supply overhang, but with enough geopolitical and climatic ""tinder"" to ignite volatility at a moment's notice.

For investors, the coming months require a focus on margins over volume. Watch for the resolution of the 45Z tax credit in early 2026, as this will be the primary catalyst for the soybean complex. Additionally, the performance of Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE: NTR) and other fertilizer giants will serve as a bellwether for 2026 planting intentions; if input costs remain high while grain prices stay low, we may see a significant shift in acreage away from corn in the next U.S. planting cycle. In this environment, the ""winners"" will be those companies with the diversified global footprints to navigate a world where the grain is plentiful, but the profit is hard-earned.

India’s transport fuel and mobility landscape saw continued expansion during 2025, with increased deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, wider adoption of biofuels and progress on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) initiatives, according to the Year End Review 2025 released by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas.

The review noted that electric mobility infrastructure grew steadily during the year. Under the FAME-II scheme, 8,932 EV charging stations were installed at retail outlets. In addition, oil marketing companies (OMCs) commissioned more than 18,500 charging stations using their own resources.

As part of a longer-term plan, public sector OMCs are developing 4,000 energy stations during the period 2024-25 to 2028-29 along major highways, corridors and other viable locations. These stations are envisaged as integrated mobility hubs offering petrol and diesel along with alternative fuels such as biofuels, CNG, LNG where feasible, and electric vehicle charging facilities. As of November 1, 1,064 energy stations had been established nationwide.

As per the review, progress was also reported under the SATAT initiative, with over 130 compressed bio gas (CBG) plants commissioned as of November 1, while several more plants remain under construction. The year also saw the commencement of mandatory blending obligations for CBG in the CNG and PNG segments from FY2025–26, supported by financial assistance for pipeline connectivity and biomass aggregation.

In the biofuels sector, ethanol blending in petrol reached an average of 19.24% in ESY 2024-25, resulting in cumulative foreign exchange savings of more than ₹1.55 lakh crore, along with reduction in carbon emissions. The review highlighted advances under the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, including the operationalisation of second-generation ethanol plants at Panipat and Numaligarh.

The aviation sector also saw a movement towards cleaner fuels. The government set indicative sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending targets of 1%, 2% and 5% in aviation turbine fuel (ATF) for international flights from 2027, 2028 and 2030, respectively. During the year, Indian Oil Corporation Limited became the first Indian company to receive ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat refinery, followed by the signing of a memorandum of understanding with Air India for SAF supply.

According to the review, biodiesel blending increased during the year as well, supported by higher procurement volumes and a broader range of feedstocks, contributing to the gradual transition towards cleaner transport fuels.

,,2025-12-26 12:05:29+00:00,Nebraska Public Media,"Nebraskans cope with rising demand, prices for electricity | Nebraska Public Media",Not Available,,,,,https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/nebraskans-cope-with-rising-demand-prices-for-electricity/,"Increased demand from data centers shows up dramatically in sales figures from the Omaha Public Power District.
Nebraskans, like many Americans, are dealing with rising demand and prices for electricity.
In 2024, they used 21% And by 2035, data centers are projected to account for 41% of OPPD’s electricity sales.
That’s not the only factor driving increased demand, according to OPPD Chief Financial Officer Brad Underwood.
Despite these pressures, Nebraska electric rates remain well below the national average.","On a windswept county road just north of Hallam, workers in lime green vests and red hard hats attach cables to attach to gleaming metallic pylons to carry power from what will be the Princeton Road station being built by the Nebraska Public Power District to supply the ever increasing demands for electricity.

Here, NPPD is installing nearly 700 megawatts of natural gas-powered-generating capacity, and it plans a similar-sized expansion in Beatrice in the early 2030s.

To put those developments in perspective, combined they will roughly equal the generating capacity of Nebraska’s largest power plant, Gerald Gentleman Station near Sutherland.

And it's not just NPPD that’s expanding. In Nebraska, Omaha Public Power District and Lincoln Electric System are both building new generation. It’s part of a trend that’s sweeping the country, said NPPD President and CEO Tom Kent.

“A lot of it's driven by the AI race, the artificial intelligence race that started within the last couple of years. It uses a lot of electricity, and we're seeing the need for growth and electric energy that we probably haven't seen since post-World War Two,” he said.

Kent said that while nationally, increased demand is being driven by data centers for AI, for NPPD the increase also includes ag-related demand for things like fertilizer, ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel.

Increased demand from data centers shows up dramatically in sales figures from the Omaha Public Power District.

Nebraskans, like many Americans, are dealing with rising demand and prices for electricity.

In 2018, data centers used 1% of the electricity sold by the utility. In 2024, they used 21% And by 2035, data centers are projected to account for 41% of OPPD’s electricity sales.

That’s not the only factor driving increased demand, according to OPPD Chief Financial Officer Brad Underwood.

""You have school systems expanding. You have medical facilities expanding. You have other box store growth. On the larger commercial side of things, you have communities and towns that are growing, whether it be Bennington or Gretna or other towns that are growing in our Greater Omaha area. And so we're really trying to make sure we rise to the demand of the totality of the customer growth,” he said.

Rising to that demand has involved building generators capable of producing 450 megawatts at Turtle Creek generating station in Sarpy County, with another 225 megawatts on the way, and another 675 megawatts in Cass County. And Lincoln Electric System is planning on installing another 100 megawatts of generating capacity in that city.

All that activity, at a cost of billions of dollars, corresponds with a period of increasing electrical rates. After holding retail prices steady for 11 years, NPPD increased rates by 2% for 2025, and will increase them by another 3% next year. Lincoln Electric System went for five years with no increase until 2023, but since then has increased rates more than 15%. And OPPD, after holding rates steady for five years, will have seen around a 20% retail rate increase since 2021.

But OPPD’s Underwood denied that data centers’ skyrocketing demand for power is driving up residential rates.

“The cost of service is a methodical process that we use, that others in the industry use, to make sure that cost-causers are cost- payers, and we get the right cost recovery from the right customer,” he said.

Underwood listed other factors behind the residential increases.

“We're offering residential customers service improvements. We're burying overhead customer lines. We're building out substations to ensure new communities are growing. We're trimming more trees. We have a new outage map. We're hardening infrastructure. All of those things are part of our cost to serve,” he said.

While OPPD’s residential rates are going up 6% next year, industrial rates are going up 8.9%.

Similarly, Lincoln Electric System’s Vice President for Power Supply, Jason Fortik, pointed to factors other than data centers as contributing to the need for increased generation and rate increases.

LES’ demand historically grew at about .4% per year, he said. But with the addition of large loads like a Google data center on the north edge of town, that’s going up to 2.7% per year.

But Fortik said winter storm Uri in 2021, which cut off power to millions in Texas and caused blackouts in Nebraska, led to increased reserve requirements for utilities’ generating capacity. Fortik saids that outweighs increasing demand for power:

“Far and away, the bigger impact came from our generators getting a lower rating. That's really the driver for us on why we're needing to add generation and do some things to improve the performance of our existing generation,” he said.

Fortik said that reserve requirement was largely responsible for 2025’s mid-year rate increase of 4%. He said next year’s 3% rate increase is due to more run-of-the-mill factors like inflation.

Despite these pressures, Nebraska electric rates remain well below the national average. Nebraska rates averaged just over 10 cents per kilowatt hour for all sectors in September, compared to 14 cents nationally, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

In some states, rapidly rising electricity prices have produced political backlash, and are seen as important factors in election results in New Jersey, Virginia, and Georgia elections last November. But NPPD’s Kent said he expects price increases will be more muted in Nebraska.

“We will see increased costs as we move into the future. Again, it's kind of the difference in timing a little bit there, but I believe it will be to a lesser extent than what you're seeing nationally,” he said.

The accuracy of that prediction will be seen in the years ahead.",https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/assets/images/IMG_4517_j1wRKcy.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-12-26 07:11:55.822755

The Ministry oversees exploration and production, refining, distribution and marketing of petroleum and natural gas, which remain critical to India’s growing economy.

Universal access to clean cooking fuel remained a key focus under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY). The number of beneficiaries reached about 10.35 crore as of 1 December 2025, Petroleum Ministry said in a year-end review on Friday.

To achieve saturation in access, the Government approved 25 lakh additional LPG connections for FY 2025–26. The eligibility process was simplified through a single Deprivation Declaration, replacing the earlier multi-point system.

LPG affordability was supported through a targeted subsidy of Rs300 per cylinder for up to nine refills annually for PMUY beneficiaries, contributing to a steady rise in consumption levels.

Efforts to improve transparency and targeting included accelerated biometric Aadhaar authentication, covering 71 percent of PMUY consumers and 62 percent of non-PMUY consumers by December 2025.

A nationwide drive launched in November enabled free, mobile-based authentication. Consumer safety was strengthened through the Basic Safety Check campaign, under which more than 12.12 crore inspections were conducted and over 4.65 crore LPG hoses were replaced at subsidised rates.

Petroleum marketing infrastructure saw continued expansion during the year. As per the official data, over 90,000 retail outlets were enabled with digital payments, supported by 2.71 lakh POS terminals, while more than 3,200 bowsers were commissioned to improve fuel delivery in remote areas.

The Petroleum Ministry said that nearly all retail outlets were equipped with toilet facilities under the Swachh Bharat Mission. Electric mobility infrastructure also expanded, with 8,932 EV charging stations installed under FAME-II and over 18,500 additional chargers set up by oil marketing companies.

The APNA GHAR initiative progressed with over 500 wayside amenities for truckers.

Public sector oil marketing companies continued developing integrated Energy Stations offering conventional fuels alongside CNG, LNG, biofuels and EV charging. As of November 2025, 1,064 such stations had been commissioned out of a planned 4,000 between 2024–25 and 2028–29.

Significant gains were made in expanding the gas-based economy. Operational natural gas pipelines increased to 25,429 km by June 2025, with an additional 10,459 km under execution, supporting the vision of a fully connected national gas grid.

The Unified Pipeline Tariff regime under the “One Nation, One Grid, One Tariff” mission covered about 90 percent of operational pipelines, improving affordability and competitiveness.

City Gas Distribution expanded to 307 geographical areas, with PNG connections reaching about 1.57 crore and CNG stations exceeding 8,400.

Under the SATAT initiative, more than 130 Compressed Bio Gas plants were commissioned by November 2025. Mandatory CBG blending in CNG and PNG commenced from FY 2025–26.

Biofuel initiatives advanced with ethanol blending in petrol averaging 19.24 percent in ESY 2024–25, generating significant foreign exchange savings and emission reductions. Second-generation ethanol plants at Panipat and Numaligarh marked key milestones under the JI-VAN Yojana.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel initiatives progressed with indicative blending targets announced for international flights from 2027 onwards. Indian Oil Corporation became the first Indian company to receive ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production, followed by an MoU with Air India for supply. Biodiesel blending also expanded with diversified feedstocks.

The upstream sector underwent major reforms with the Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Act, 2025 and notification of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 2025.

Under the Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy, 172 blocks were awarded, attracting committed investments of about USD 4.36 billion. Strategic petroleum reserves were strengthened through progress on Phase-II facilities and overseas investments by Indian PSUs.

Overall, the Ministry’s initiatives during 2025 reflected sustained efforts to strengthen energy access, affordability, sustainability and security, supporting India’s transition towards a resilient and inclusive energy future.",https://knnindia.co.in/uploads/newsfiles/PETROL-26-12-2025.jpg,N,,2025-12-26 07:12:00.045411

Figures published by the Department for Transport (DfT), covering most of 2025, show that SAF accounted for just 1.6 per cent of aviation fuel supplied for UK flights.
The policy, which came into force in January, obliges fuel suppliers to blend a minimum proportion of SAF into the overall aviation fuel mix.
Just over 160 million litres of SAF were used by early October, out of roughly 10 billion litres of jet fuel consumed by UK aviation over the same period.
The airport expects to meet its own target of 3 per cent SAF use over 2025, although airlines operating outside major hubs say supplies remain limited.","The take-up of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is on track to fall short of the UK government’s first annual mandate, according to provisional official data, raising fresh doubts over the pace of aviation decarbonisation.

Figures published by the Department for Transport (DfT), covering most of 2025, show that SAF accounted for just 1.6 per cent of aviation fuel supplied for UK flights. That is around a fifth lower in volume than the 2 per cent required under the mandate introduced at the start of the year.

The policy, which came into force in January, obliges fuel suppliers to blend a minimum proportion of SAF into the overall aviation fuel mix. The targets rise sharply over time, increasing to 10 per cent by 2030 and 22 per cent by 2040, including the use of so-called second-generation fuels that are viewed as more sustainable but are not yet produced at scale.

So far, all of the SAF supplied to the UK market has been derived from recycled cooking oil sourced from Asia, predominantly China, the data shows. Just over 160 million litres of SAF were used by early October, out of roughly 10 billion litres of jet fuel consumed by UK aviation over the same period.

The DfT stressed that the figures are provisional and subject to verification delays, with final data for the year not expected until November 2026. A spokesperson said SAF volumes are continuing to rise and that not all suppliers have yet reported the fuel they have delivered.

While aircraft burning SAF emit similar levels of carbon dioxide in flight to conventional jet fuel, the fuel is classed as lower-carbon overall because of how it is produced. Despite scepticism from some scientists and environmental groups, SAF is widely regarded as the main route for cutting emissions from long-haul aviation in particular.

The data comes as the government continues to back aviation expansion as part of its growth strategy, granting approval for projects at airports including Gatwick and Luton, while promising to consult the Climate Change Committee over plans for a third runway at Heathrow.

Earlier this month, the aviation minister Keir Mather told an industry conference that decarbonisation would be a “licence for growth” and said SAF represented the sector’s biggest opportunity to reduce emissions. He pointed to the government’s SAF bill, currently passing through the House of Lords, which is designed to guarantee prices for SAF and reduce investment risk for producers.

Heathrow airport has already introduced incentives to encourage airlines to use cleaner fuels, cutting landing charges for carriers that adopt SAF. The airport expects to meet its own target of 3 per cent SAF use over 2025, although airlines operating outside major hubs say supplies remain limited.

Industry bodies have warned that future mandates could be difficult to meet, particularly as more expensive second-generation and power-to-liquid fuels are brought into the targets before production capacity is fully established.

Globally, the UK remains ahead of most markets. The airline trade body Iata recently said SAF accounted for just 0.6 per cent of worldwide jet fuel use in 2025, rising to a projected 0.8 per cent next year. Its director general Willie Walsh has criticised mandates, arguing that governments need to design incentives that genuinely stimulate production.

Duncan McCourt, chief executive of the industry group Sustainable Aviation, said the provisional figures showed the UK was already using “significant quantities” of SAF and added that the sector remained confident the mandate would be met as supply continues to grow in the coming years.",https://travellingforbusiness.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2463328417.jpg,N,,2025-12-26 07:12:05.511054
,,2025-12-26 11:45:34+00:00,ChiniMandi,Industry view: Why sugar MSP should be increased - ChiniMandi,Parshwati Saha,,,,,https://www.chinimandi.com/industry-view-why-sugar-msp-should-be-increased/,"The sugar industry has been demanding an increase in the Minimum Selling Price (MSP) of sugar to cover the rising cost of sugar production in the country.
This will translate into a higher payout to farmers by sugar mills, as mills are expected to crush a larger quantity of sugarcane due to increased production.
As a result, sugar mills are under acute financial stress, facing liquidity constraints and cash-flow challenges,” he added.
Kothari added that revising the sugar MSP would provide immediate financial relief to the industry by improving realisations and cash flows.
Kothari said, “The Ugar Sugar Works Ltd. is advocating the industry’s demand for converting sugar mills into Energy Hubs.","The sugar industry has been demanding an increase in the Minimum Selling Price (MSP) of sugar to cover the rising cost of sugar production in the country.

For the 2025–26 sugar season, the Central Government increased the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane to Rs 355 per quintal, while Uttar Pradesh, a major sugarcane-producing state, raised the State Advised Price (SAP) by Rs 30 per quintal.

This will translate into a higher payout to farmers by sugar mills, as mills are expected to crush a larger quantity of sugarcane due to increased production.

According to the Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA), the recent surge in sugarcane costs across Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Punjab, Haryana, and Uttarakhand has pushed the pan-India average cost of sugar production to Rs 41.72 per kilogram, while the MSP remains stagnant at Rs 31 per kilogram.

The widening gap between cash outgo and income, coupled with stagnant ethanol procurement prices and reduced ethanol allocation to molasses-based distilleries, has become a major concern for sugar mills, according to the sugar industry.

Speaking to ChiniMandi, Jatin Kothari, Senior Executive Officer, The Ugar Sugar Works Ltd., said that one of the primary reasons for advocating an increase in MSP of sugar is the sharp escalation in production costs over the past few years. Sugar mills are facing sustained increases in key input costs.

“In several major sugar-producing states, the actual cost of production of sugar has already exceeded the prevailing market prices. This growing mismatch between costs and realisations has severely eroded mill margins. As a result, sugar mills are under acute financial stress, facing liquidity constraints and cash-flow challenges,” he added.

Kothari added that revising the sugar MSP would provide immediate financial relief to the industry by improving realisations and cash flows. This, in turn, would enable mills to operate efficiently and ensure timely payment to the farmers, strengthening rural incomes, reducing dependence on short-term borrowings and improving creditworthiness.

“More importantly, a rationalised MSP will play a critical role in supporting the Government’s flagship energy transition and bio-economy initiatives. Improved financial stability will allow sugar mills to invest confidently in future-oriented growth areas, including ethanol expansion to support energy security, Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG) projects aligned with waste-to-wealth and circular economy objectives, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as a next-generation clean fuel, and PDM and other value-added bio-products,” Kothari stated.

He said that these investments require significant capital outlay, long gestation periods, and strong balance sheets, which are difficult to achieve under suppressed sugar realisations.

Kothari said, “The Ugar Sugar Works Ltd. is advocating the industry’s demand for converting sugar mills into Energy Hubs. This will increase the ethanol demand structurally and eliminate the intermediaries.”

“If sugar mills become energy hubs, the direct ethanol and other green fuel dispensation will improve margins of the sugar mills on account of improved per tonne revenue of sugarcane. This will reduce the transportation bottlenecks and help achieve zero-waste economics. From the economic point of view, rural jobs and economy will get a big impetus, which will make it self-reliant,” he concluded.",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Industry-view-Why-sugar-MSP-should-be-increased.jpeg,N,,2025-12-26 07:12:11.704229
,,2025-12-26 11:13:45+00:00,Inc,How This Sustainable Jet Fuel Company Is Charting a New Route in the Trump Era,Fast Company,,,,,https://www.inc.com/fast-company-2/sustainable-jet-fuel-company-lanzajet-trump-era/91282662,"Set to be completed this year, the facility is design to produce climate-friendly jet fuel, a material in increasing demand in response to climate commitments and regulations around the world.
It will account for just 0.7% of all jet fuel in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association.
In 2010, LanzaTech and the U.S. Department of Energy started collaborating on technology to transform ethanol into jet fuel.
(Various estimates put SAF from two to five times as expensive as traditional jet fuel.)
“You’re not getting a ton of greenhouse gas savings relative to just using [traditional] jet fuel,” he says.","A first-of-its-kind refinery has been in the works for a decade and half. Set to be completed this year, the facility is design to produce climate-friendly jet fuel, a material in increasing demand in response to climate commitments and regulations around the world. The refinery—called the Freedom Pines Fuels—was designed to showcase new methods of producing the fuel, and was receiving government support to help clean up air travel.

Now, a year behind schedule due to a hurricane and equipment glitches, the project hit another roadblock this summer, when a major shift in U.S. energy policy under the new administration threw a wrench into the business model. It’s now a story of a company quickly adapting under pressure, and an illustration of the challenges—and continued opportunity—of clean energy in a more hostile political environment.

The goal of the company behind the project, Illinois-based LanzaJet, is to produce a close facsimile of the kerosene-based fuel that powers jets and many helicopters and propeller planes today—without using petroleum. Instead, the Freedom Pines Fuels plant in the forest hamlet of Soperton, Georgia, will use ethanol to make what’s known as sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. LanzaJet was ready to start with ethanol made from Brazilian sugarcane, until a new U.S. law forced a quick shift to midwestern corn.

The fuels that make modern travel possible—kerosene, gasoline, and diesel—are typically refined from crude oil, rich in hydrocarbon molecules that release copious energy when burned. But burning them also inundates the atmosphere with heat-trapping carbon dioxide.

SAF is essentially lab-grown jet fuel, made from carbon already in the environment, rather than pumped up from oil wells. It’s a tweaked formulation—for instance, with less sulfur—designed to burn cleaner. Sugarcane and corn are two of many possible carbon sources, along with cornstalks, twigs, vegetable oil, factory exhaust, and even garbage. The CO2 released by making and burning SAF should, in theory, be offset by the carbon captured to make more SAF, forming a closed loop.

The Freedom Pines Fuels plant is a mini version of a typical refinery, slated to produce nine million gallons of SAF and a million of green diesel fuel in its first year. (A standard crude-oil refinery could churn a billion or more gallons of fuels.)

But the Georgia plant is meant to be big enough to show the technology can work at scale. “Most process technology companies . . . almost never build plants of this magnitude,” says Jimmy Samartzis, a climate-focused airline industry veteran who became CEO when LanzaJet was founded in 2020. “It’s expensive, it’s big. But we thought and felt—accurately, looking back on it today—it was the right move to make.” Before the 2024 election, the federal government was also promising generous financial support for Freedom Pines.

A Potential Market Boom

LanzaJet is backed by companies that are counting on, or stand to benefit from, the shift to carbon-neutral jet fuel, including All Nippon Airways, British Airways, Southwest Airlines, and plane maker Airbus.

The UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has committed the industry to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In addition, laws and regulations, such as in Singapore, the U.K., and the European Union, have started requiring airlines or suppliers to blend SAF into the jet fuel supply, beginning at around 1–2%, then ramping up in later years. More such requirements are in the works in India, Indonesia, and Japan. The European Union is by far the most ambitious. From a mere 2% SAF blend required today, quotas rise steeply about every five years, hitting 70% in 2050.

There’s further demand from companies, such as LanzaJet backer Microsoft, striving to meet aggressive greenhouse gas reduction goals. In addition to reducing its own footprint, Microsoft has announced plans to buy “SAF Certificates,” which subsidize the cost of the fuel to boost its usage. SAF has a long way to go in making a dent. It will account for just 0.7% of all jet fuel in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association.

“Obviously, if you look at the size of the overall aviation fuel space, in theory the [SAF] market is potentially huge for those that can offer a product at a competitive price,” says John MacDonagh, senior research analyst at capital markets research firm PitchBook.

LanzaJet has raised “approximately” $400 million, according to Samartzis, from these companies and other backers, including energy producers Shell and Suncor, the U.S. Department of Energy, airport operator Groupe ADP, and Bill Gates’s Breakthrough Energy fund.

Another backer is LanzaTech. Founded in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2005, it relocated its headquarters to Skokie, Illinois, in 2014. The company has engineered microbes to convert waste such as carbon monoxide and dioxide from factories into ethanol, as another route to carbon-neutral fuel and other chemicals. In 2010, LanzaTech and the U.S. Department of Energy started collaborating on technology to transform ethanol into jet fuel. In 2020, LanzaTech spun out LanzaJet as a new company to continue the work.

LanzaJet is dipping a toe into the SAF market with Freedom Pines, with plans to build more plants, such as a collaboration with British Airways to open a facility in the U.K. by 2028. LanzaJet has also announced partnerships in India, Japan, and Kazakhstan to build additional facilities. But as it continues to announce expansion overseas, things have gotten messy back at home.

SAF Meets MAGA

The U.S. has no SAF requirements for aviation companies. Instead, the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act introduced tax credits to subsidize fledgling SAF operations to scale up production and bring down prices. (Various estimates put SAF from two to five times as expensive as traditional jet fuel.) While the Republican One Big Beautiful Bill Act didn’t scrap SAF incentives completely, as it did for many other clean technologies, it did complicate LanzaJet’s plans just as it was completing the Freedom Pines plant.

LanzaJet had obtained EPA approval to use traditional ethanol to make its fuel. The company was focused on Brazilian sugarcane, which Samartzis says would cut CO2 emissions by more than the 50% threshold to qualify for credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. The new Republican legislation cut maximum subsidies from $1.75 to $1 per gallon—and limited them to fuels made with resources from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

So LanzaJet has shifted focus to ethanol made from U.S. corn, which is more carbon intensive, for a number of reasons, says Samartzis. Sugarcane tends to have higher yields per acre, with less fertilizer, according to LanzJet, and of course it provides sugar that can be fermented directly into ethanol. Corn provides starch that first has to be converted to sugar, which takes energy. Brazilian ethanol producers also make use of crop leftovers, burning them to provide energy for their operations. U.S. producers often use natural gas or even coal.

Given all that, using corn won’t cut overall greenhouse gas emissions anywhere near the 50% target, without longer-term changes such as more sustainable farming practices and capturing the carbon released in making the ethanol, he says.

Despite all these challenges, Samartzis says that Freedom Pines will start churning out fuel soon. “Yeah, I’ve faltered in the past, right?”, he says with a chuckle. “But my expectation is that it’s certainly this year . . . How soon? I don’t want to speculate on that at this point.”

Meanwhile, LanzaJet has to compete with an established technology, called HEFA, that is already making jet fuel from fats such as used cooking oil. “Most [SAF demand] right now can be met, or all of it initially can be met, with the HEFA fuels that are less costly to produce,” says Andy Navarrete, coauthor of a recent study on sustainable aviation fuel by the International Council on Clean Transportation.

A New Starting Point

However, HEFA can’t scale up for the boom in demand coming in the next decades, he says, without turning to environmentally destructive options like clearing land for palm oil plantations. Navarrete is also circumspect about corn ethanol. “You’re not getting a ton of greenhouse gas savings relative to just using [traditional] jet fuel,” he says.

“And then there’s this bigger question of food versus fuel. And how sustainable is it, in general, to be using farmland to produce a fuel?”

Samartzis cites USDA estimates of U.S. ethanol supplies exceeding domestic demand and frames SAF as a new market for American farmers. But beyond corn and sugarcane, there can be bigger climate benefits in making ethanol from the cellulose in agricultural leftovers—like corn stalks, leaves, husks, and cobs—that might otherwise release CO2 when they rot.

This approach was always part of LanzaJet’s strategy, and it had already submitted its plan to the EPA for approval. (The U.K. plant is meant to begin operations with this “cellulosic” ethanol when it opens in 2028.) But U.S. politics are creating another roadblock. “All of these things take time, and with the government shutdown on top of it, rest assured, those processes are not moving forward right now,” says Samartzis.

Navarrete is skeptical, noting that makers of green auto fuels also foresaw a progression to using cellulose from agricultural waste. “It relied on a completely different set of technologies . . . that never quite got figured out,” he says. “[Starting with] conventional ethanol wasn’t really a useful bridge forward.”

Technology has progressed since then, with new incentives to fill the growing SAF market. Samartzis remains optimistic about a transition for the longer term. “Maybe it’s a 10 or 20% improvement rather than a 50 or 60 or 70% improvement,” he says of initial CO2 reductions using corn ethanol. “We can start to capture the improvement and then continue to invest in the changes that are required to further improve that carbon [reduction] intensity.”

Through targeted welfare schemes, regulatory reforms and large-scale infrastructure development, the sector continued to support India’s growing economy while aligning with national priorities of sustainability and inclusion.

A major thrust during the year remained universal access to clean cooking fuel. Under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), the number of beneficiaries reached around 10.35 crore by December 1, 2025. To move closer to saturation, the government approved the release of an additional 25 lakh LPG connections during FY 2025–26. The process of eligibility was simplified through a single Deprivation Declaration, replacing the earlier multi-point system and making access quicker and more inclusive. Affordability was reinforced through a targeted subsidy of ₹300 per 14.2 kg cylinder for up to nine refills annually for PMUY beneficiaries. This support translated into higher and sustained LPG usage, with average per capita consumption rising steadily to a pro-rated level of about 4.85 refills per year in FY 2025–26.

Efforts to improve transparency and targeting of subsidies continued with the expansion of biometric Aadhaar authentication. By December 2025, 71 per cent of PMUY consumers and 62 per cent of non-PMUY consumers had completed biometric verification. A nationwide drive launched in November further simplified the process through mobile-based authentication, offered free of cost. Alongside access and affordability, consumer safety received renewed attention. Under the nationwide Basic Safety Check campaign, over 12.12 crore free safety inspections were conducted at consumer premises, and more than 4.65 crore LPG hoses were replaced at subsidised rates, strengthening household safety standards.

Fuel retail infrastructure also saw notable upgrades. Over 90,000 petrol pumps were enabled with digital payment facilities supported by more than 2.71 lakh POS terminals, improving convenience and transparency. Door-to-door fuel delivery expanded through the commissioning of over 3,200 bowsers, improving access in remote and underserved areas. Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, toilet facilities were ensured at nearly all retail outlets, with many providing separate amenities for men and women. The APNA GHAR initiative gained momentum, with more than 500 wayside amenities for truck drivers established across highways, contributing to road safety, better working conditions and rural employment.

Electric mobility infrastructure expanded rapidly during the year. Under the FAME-II scheme, 8,932 EV charging stations were installed at fuel retail outlets, while oil marketing companies added over 18,500 more using their own resources. Public sector oil companies also progressed with the development of integrated Energy Stations. As part of the plan to set up 4,000 such stations between 2024–25 and 2028–29, 1,064 Energy Stations had been commissioned by November 2025, offering petrol, diesel, alternative fuels such as CNG and biofuels, and EV charging facilities at a single location.

Significant progress was made in expanding the gas-based economy. India’s operational natural gas pipeline network grew from 15,340 km in 2014 to 25,429 km by June 2025, with another 10,459 km under construction. Completion of these projects is expected to fully connect the national gas grid, improving regional access and supporting balanced development. To address regional cost disparities, the Unified Pipeline Tariff regime under the “One Nation, One Grid, One Tariff” mission continued to be implemented, covering nearly 90 per cent of operational pipelines and replacing the earlier distance-based tariff system.

City Gas Distribution expanded further, covering 307 geographical areas by September 2025. Domestic PNG connections increased to around 1.57 crore, while the number of CNG stations crossed 8,400. Revised domestic gas allocation guidelines improved alignment with actual consumption and reduced exposure to price volatility for consumers. The SATAT initiative also advanced, with over 130 compressed biogas plants commissioned by November 2025. Mandatory blending obligations for CBG in CNG and PNG came into effect from FY 2025–26, supported by financial assistance for pipeline connectivity and biomass aggregation.

Biofuels remained a key pillar of the clean energy transition. Ethanol blending in petrol reached an average of 19.24 per cent in the Ethanol Supply Year 2024–25, contributing to cumulative foreign exchange savings of over ₹1.55 lakh crore and significant reductions in carbon emissions. The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana supported the promotion of advanced biofuels, with second-generation ethanol plants at Panipat and Numaligarh becoming operational milestones. Biodiesel blending also expanded during the year through higher procurement volumes and diversified feedstocks.

New initiatives in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) took shape in 2025. The government announced indicative blending targets of 1 per cent, 2 per cent and 5 per cent SAF for international flights from 2027, 2028 and 2030, respectively. In line with this roadmap, Indian Oil Corporation Limited became the first Indian company to receive ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat refinery, followed by an MoU with Air India for supply of SAF.

The upstream sector underwent important structural reforms with the enactment of the Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Act, 2025 and the notification of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 2025. Under the Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy, 172 blocks covering more than 3.78 lakh square kilometres were awarded, attracting committed investments of around USD 4.36 billion. Exploration activity intensified through seismic surveys, drilling programmes and government-supported initiatives such as Mission Anveshan. Strategic petroleum reserves were strengthened through progress under Phase-II facilities and renewed international partnerships, while overseas investments by Indian oil and gas PSUs continued to diversify supply sources.

Overall, 2025 saw the petroleum and natural gas sector advance on multiple fronts—expanding clean cooking access, modernising fuel retail infrastructure, strengthening the gas grid, accelerating biofuels and electric mobility, and reforming upstream exploration. These efforts collectively reinforced energy access, affordability, sustainability and security, supporting India’s transition towards a resilient and inclusive energy system.",https://ddnews.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/favicon.png,N,,2025-12-26 06:12:25.471536

Hawaiian began working with Par Hawaii in 2022 to study whether sustainable aviation fuel could be produced commercially in the state.
The effort was later expanded after Alaska Air Group completed its acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines in September 2024.
Together, the two airlines use more than 200 million gallons of jet fuel in Hawaii each year, mostly for long-distance flights.
James said expanding the use of cleaner aviation fuel will require close cooperation among airlines, fuel producers, farmers, investors and government agencies, along with supportive policies and incentives.","Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines plan to start operating some of their aircraft using biofuel produced in Hawaii from early next year. The two airlines, which are owned by Alaska Air Group, will also invest in a joint venture aimed at developing a local supply chain for sustainable aviation fuel in the state, reports The Garden Island.

The airlines are partnering with several companies, including fuel refinery operator Par Hawaii, to promote the cultivation of Camelina sativa, commonly known as false flax. The crop is being developed as a source of biofuel for aviation and as feed for cattle and poultry.

The airlines said the initiative will help increase the use of cleaner aviation fuel, cut greenhouse gas emissions and support Hawaii’s target of meeting all its energy needs from renewable sources by 2045.

Alanna James, sustainability innovation director at Hawaiian and Alaska, said the airlines see reducing environmental impact as part of their responsibility while continuing to provide essential air services across the islands and beyond. She said the companies have a long-term plan to achieve net-zero carbon emissions and that sustainable aviation fuel will play a key role in reaching that goal.

Hawaiian began working with Par Hawaii in 2022 to study whether sustainable aviation fuel could be produced commercially in the state. The effort was later expanded after Alaska Air Group completed its acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines in September 2024.

Par Hawaii, a unit of Texas-based Par Pacific Holdings, has been converting part of its Kapolei refinery over the past few years to produce renewable fuels for power generation and for use in air, land and marine transport. The company initially invested $90 million in the project and later sold a 36.5 per cent stake to a joint venture between Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp. and ENEOS Corp. for $100 million.

Once operational, the facility will be the largest renewable fuel plant in Hawaii, with the capacity to produce around 61 million gallons of fuel a year. The plant is designed to make up to 60 per cent aviation fuel, though most of the output in the early stages will be renewable diesel sold to markets on the US mainland.

Par Hawaii said renewable fuel production is expected to begin between January and March next year, with initial feedstock coming from canola oil, used cooking oil and animal fat imported from Canada.

Par Hawaii president Eric Wright said the progress toward producing aviation fuel locally has moved faster than expected since the initial study with Hawaiian Airlines began. He said the fuels produced could cut carbon emissions by as much as 80 per cent compared with conventional fuels.

Hawaiian and Alaska already use limited quantities of sustainable aviation fuel on some routes, but none of it is currently produced in Hawaii. The fuel can be used in existing aircraft engines, but at present it can only be blended up to 50 per cent with conventional jet fuel.

To develop a local source of fuel, Honolulu-based conservation firm Pono Pacific is leading efforts to grow Camelina in Hawaii. The company has been testing multiple non-GMO varieties of the crop across the islands in partnership with farms, agricultural groups and dairy producers. Pono Pacific is also exploring the use of by-products from Camelina oil extraction as animal feed.

The company plans to speed up Camelina cultivation next year, noting that the crop matures in under two months, resists pests and can be grown alongside food crops.

Pono Pacific said Camelina offers an opportunity for Hawaii to build a closed-loop model that supports renewable fuels, local agriculture and food security.

Even as work on local crops continues, Hawaiian and Alaska are expected to be the first buyers of aviation fuel produced at Par Hawaii’s facility. The airlines have not disclosed how much fuel they plan to use initially, describing the volumes as limited due to high costs and supply constraints.

Together, the two airlines use more than 200 million gallons of jet fuel in Hawaii each year, mostly for long-distance flights.

James said expanding the use of cleaner aviation fuel will require close cooperation among airlines, fuel producers, farmers, investors and government agencies, along with supportive policies and incentives.

The Hawaii Department of Transportation recently finalised a plan to sharply cut emissions from road, air and sea transport by 2045. The plan includes proposals for state tax credits to encourage the production and use of aviation biofuel, similar to incentives offered in other US states.

Transport department director Ed Sniffen said the initiative by the airlines and their partners marks an important step toward building a local, lower-emission aviation fuel supply that aligns with Hawaii’s clean energy goals.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-13.png,N,,2025-12-26 06:12:35.254561

The welcoming ceremony took place on December 25, 2025, and was attended by senior leadership, including the Chairman of the Board, board members, executive management, and invited guests.

The aircraft was delivered from the Airbus Delivery Center in Germany under an operating lease arrangement with AerCap, reflecting international collaboration in fleet financing and management.

This first A321neo is part of an initial batch of ten aircraft entering service through leasing agreements.

Thai Airways views this approach as a flexible method to modernize its fleet while maintaining financial discipline during its recovery and growth phase.

This is the first time in recent years that Thai Airways has operated narrow-body aircraft directly under the mainline brand. Previously, short-haul flying sat with Thai Smile, which was dissolved in 2024.

Those former Thai Smile Airbus A320 aircraft have now been absorbed into the mainline operation, creating a more unified fleet and service standard.

Cabin And Technology

CFM LEAP-1A engines power the Airbus A321neo and feature advanced aerodynamics that reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per seat by up to 20 percent.

The aircraft is also certified to operate with up to 50 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel, supporting the airline’s environmental objectives.

The cabin is configured with 175 seats, including 16 Royal Silk Class seats and 159 Economy Class seats.

Royal Silk Class offers fully flat beds with 180-degree recline and increased seat pitch, delivering a widebody-style experience on regional routes.

Economy Class seating focuses on comfort through ergonomic design, 110-degree recline, and adjustable headrests. Passengers also benefit from an in-flight entertainment system at every seat, featuring 4K touchscreens with Bluetooth connectivity.

Additional enhancements include Airspace XL overhead bins that increase storage capacity by up to 40 percent, along with mood lighting and a welcome ceiling designed to improve the onboard atmosphere.

Interior elements reflect Thai cultural identity blended with modern international styling.

Regional Network Plans

Thai Airways plans to deploy the A321neo primarily on regional Asia-Pacific routes where demand supports premium and leisure travel.

The aircraft’s efficiency allows the airline to serve high-frequency sectors while controlling operating costs.

The inaugural commercial service is scheduled for 22 January 2026 on the Bangkok–Singapore–Bangkok route, marking the aircraft’s entry into revenue operations.

The airline has stated that further route assignments will follow as additional A321neo aircraft join the fleet.

Bottom Line

The induction of the Airbus A321neo represents a strategic step for Thai Airways as it strengthens its regional fleet with modern, fuel-efficient aircraft.

With 32 units on order, the type is set to play a central role in network growth, sustainability goals, and service quality improvement across Asia-Pacific markets.

The airline gains flexibility to compete in busy Asian markets where passenger expectations are high. The large order also creates greater product consistency, something that has historically been missing from the fleet.

China allocated an export quota of 370,000 mt/y to Shandong Haike in mid-October, and the company currently exports about 20,000 mt/month, according to another company source.
Henan Junheng received a 240,000 mt/y export quota in December, according to the NDRC.
Quotas for other certified producers are as follows: Shandong Sanju Bioenergy with 158,000 mt/y, Zhangjiagang EcoCeres with 260,000 mt/y, and Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech with 372,400 mt/y.","China's Shandong Haike Chemical has become the sixth domestic producer to secure airworthiness certification for sustainable aviation fuel, raising the nation's certified production capacity to 1.375 million metric tons/year ahead of mandatory domestic blending requirements and surging international demand driven by tighter aviation emissions regulations.

The Civil Aviation Administration of China approved Shandong Haike's HEFA-SPK synthetic fuel Dec. 22, validating its 375,000 mt/y production capacity derived from used cooking oil, according to the official WeChat account of the SAF Research Center, CAAC Second Research Institute, on Dec. 24.

Shandong Haike joins a group of certified Chinese SAF producers, including Sinopec Zhenhai Refining & Petrochemical, Henan Junheng, Shandong Sanju Bioenergy, Lianyungang Jia'ao, and Zhangjiagang EcoCeres, according to the CAAC.

China's domestic SAF industry entered its initial commercialization phase in September 2024, following the launch of a pilot program by the National Development and Reform Commission and the CAAC. Under the program's first phase, Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines refueled 12 flights with SAF from four key airports: Beijing Daxing, Chengdu Shuangliu, Zhengzhou Xinzheng and Ningbo Lishe.

In the second phase, which began March 19, 2025, all domestic flights from the four designated airports will regularly use a 1% SAF blend.

Export focus

Despite growing certified production capacity, domestic SAF consumption remains modest in China at about 50,000 mt/y, all supplied to state-owned China National Aviation Fuel, according to a source with Shandong Haike.

Rising supply has led Chinese producers to target international markets, with a total authorized SAF export quota of 1.4 million mt/y for 2025 across five facilities.

China allocated an export quota of 370,000 mt/y to Shandong Haike in mid-October, and the company currently exports about 20,000 mt/month, according to another company source.

Industry sources say China is capitalizing on its substantial export quota allocation to meet the strengthening international demand for SAF, driven by increasingly stringent aviation decarbonization mandates in regions such as Europe and North America.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-26 07:12:20.068125

Capitalizing on ST Engineering’s proficiency in maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) as well as passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversions, Juniper acquires mid-life aircraft and transforms them into environmentally sustainable freighters. This approach extends the economic life of these assets, which are subsequently leased and managed for airlines aiming to modernize their fleets and enhance operational sustainability.

Market Challenges and Regulatory Landscape

Juniper’s expansion occurs within a complex market environment influenced by regulatory dependencies and certification processes. Recent developments, including Boeing’s ongoing certification challenges, highlight potential obstacles that could affect the speed at which converted freighters are delivered to airline customers. These regulatory factors remain critical in determining the pace of fleet modernization and the availability of converted aircraft in the market.

Competitive Pressures and Industry Responses

The competitive landscape is becoming increasingly dynamic, with regional logistics operators and maintenance providers introducing new freighter options. For instance, Taby Air Maintenance’s Saab 2000 Cargo Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) has garnered interest from operators seeking modern and efficient cargo solutions. This trend reflects intensifying competition within the converted freighter segment, as airlines and logistics companies pursue flexible and cost-effective fleet strategies.

In response to these evolving market conditions, industry players are adopting strategic initiatives to modernize their fleets. Wheels Up, for example, has engaged in sale-leaseback transactions to free up capital for future aircraft acquisitions, illustrating a broader shift toward asset-light business models and enhanced financial agility.

Juniper’s strategy, which combines technical expertise with sustainable leasing solutions, positions the company to play a significant role in the transforming air cargo sector.

France, Spain, and Thailand See Explosive Growth in Eco-Tourism — How Emirates & Delta Are Preparing for the 2025–2032 Boom in Sustainable Travel!

The luxury eco-tourism market is set for explosive growth between 2025 and 2032, and countries like France, Spain, and Thailand are already leading the charge. With travelers increasingly seeking eco-conscious destinations and experiences, the airline and hospitality industries are responding to this shift with enthusiasm. As the demand for sustainable travel soars, leading airlines like Emirates and Delta are positioning themselves to meet the needs of eco-conscious tourists. This travel article explores the booming eco-tourism trends, the role of airlines, and how luxury resorts are catering to this new wave of responsible travelers.

France, Spain, and Thailand See Explosive Growth in Eco-Tourism

The growth of the eco-tourism market is undeniable, with countries such as France, Spain, and Thailand seeing unprecedented increases in international arrivals. These nations are embracing the eco-tourism trend, with travelers flocking to their green destinations, eager to enjoy nature while minimizing their environmental footprint.

France, the world’s most visited country, has long been a leader in tourism, attracting millions of tourists every year. In recent years, however, eco-tourism has become a growing sector, with visitors choosing destinations that emphasize sustainability, conservation, and low-impact tourism. From eco-friendly vineyards in Bordeaux to green retreats in Provence, France is tapping into its natural beauty to attract eco-conscious travelers. France is investing heavily in green infrastructure, such as electric car rentals and low-emission transportation options, to ensure that visitors can explore the country in an environmentally friendly way.

Spain is another European country making strides in the eco-tourism sector. Known for its stunning beaches, historic cities, and vibrant culture, Spain has become a prime destination for travelers seeking sustainable tourism options. Cities like Barcelona and Madrid are promoting green tourism initiatives, offering eco-tours, sustainable restaurants, and environmentally friendly accommodations. Spain is also home to several eco-resorts in its scenic rural areas, allowing tourists to immerse themselves in nature while supporting local communities and conservation efforts.

Thailand, a popular travel destination in Southeast Asia, is embracing eco-tourism with open arms. Known for its pristine beaches, tropical forests, and rich biodiversity, Thailand is increasingly attracting tourists who are looking for eco-friendly travel experiences. The Thai government has introduced various initiatives to protect the environment, including sustainable hotel certifications and eco-tourism programs that encourage travelers to explore nature without harming it. Thai resorts are focusing on sustainability, offering locally sourced organic food, eco-friendly accommodations, and activities that minimize the environmental impact.

These three countries are setting the stage for a new era of eco-tourism, where responsible travel is at the forefront of the industry. As the demand for green travel experiences continues to grow, these nations are well-positioned to offer travelers sustainable options that align with their environmental values.

How Emirates & Delta Are Preparing for the 2025–2032 Boom in Sustainable Travel

As the eco-tourism market experiences rapid growth, airlines like Emirates and Delta are gearing up to meet the increasing demand for sustainable travel. Airlines play a crucial role in reducing the environmental impact of travel, and both Emirates and Delta are investing heavily in sustainable aviation practices to ensure they are part of the solution.

Emirates, a global leader in luxury travel, has been at the forefront of the green travel movement. The airline has implemented various initiatives to reduce its carbon footprint, including the use of fuel-efficient aircraft and the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Emirates is also investing in eco-friendly cabin products and services, such as biodegradable amenities and waste reduction efforts. The airline’s commitment to sustainability is evident in its efforts to minimize the environmental impact of both its flights and on-the-ground operations.

Delta Airlines, known for its commitment to customer service and sustainability, is also making strides in the eco-tourism sector. The airline has set ambitious goals to reduce its carbon emissions, including a pledge to become carbon-neutral by 2050. Delta has invested in fuel-efficient aircraft, sustainable jet fuel, and carbon offset programs to reduce its environmental impact. The airline’s commitment to sustainable travel extends beyond just carbon emissions; it also focuses on minimizing waste, improving energy efficiency, and promoting responsible tourism practices across its operations.

Both Emirates and Delta are responding to the growing demand for eco-tourism by aligning their services with sustainability principles. Whether it’s through eco-friendly in-flight services, fuel-efficient planes, or carbon offset initiatives, these airlines are ensuring that travelers can reduce their environmental impact while enjoying luxury travel experiences. As eco-tourism continues to rise in popularity, Emirates and Delta are positioning themselves as leaders in sustainable aviation, attracting environmentally conscious travelers who want to make a positive impact on the planet.

The Role of Luxury Resorts in Eco-Tourism

As travelers seek sustainable vacation options, the hospitality industry is rising to the challenge by offering luxury resorts that align with eco-tourism values. France, Spain, and Thailand are home to some of the world’s most luxurious eco-friendly resorts, where guests can enjoy world-class accommodations while supporting environmental conservation.

In France, the concept of “green luxury” has gained significant traction in recent years. Eco-conscious travelers can find eco-resorts in stunning locations such as the French Riviera, where hotels like Château De La Messardière are incorporating sustainable practices into their operations. These resorts focus on reducing energy consumption, using local and organic products, and offering activities that promote environmental awareness. Additionally, many French luxury resorts are located in close proximity to natural reserves, giving guests the opportunity to explore pristine landscapes while minimizing their environmental impact.

In Spain, luxury eco-tourism is taking off in regions like Costa Brava and the Balearic Islands. Resorts like the Vilar Rural de Sant Hilari are setting the standard for eco-friendly accommodations, with an emphasis on local sourcing, renewable energy, and waste reduction. Spain’s luxury resorts also provide guests with immersive nature experiences, such as guided hiking tours, bird-watching excursions, and culinary experiences that highlight sustainable local food.

Thailand is also a hub for luxury eco-tourism, with resorts like Soneva Kiri and Six Senses offering sustainable accommodations in beautiful natural settings. These resorts incorporate eco-friendly practices such as rainwater harvesting, solar power, and waste recycling. Guests can also engage in conservation efforts, such as coral reef restoration programs and wildlife protection initiatives. Thailand’s luxury eco-resorts offer the perfect blend of comfort and sustainability, providing travelers with a guilt-free way to indulge in luxury while supporting the local environment.

These luxury resorts are playing a crucial role in the rise of eco-tourism, offering travelers a chance to experience the beauty of nature while making a positive impact. By prioritizing sustainability, these resorts are attracting eco-conscious travelers who want to support responsible tourism practices.

Travel Tips for Eco-Conscious Tourists

As more travelers seek sustainable vacation options, it’s important to understand how to travel responsibly while enjoying luxury experiences. Here are some essential travel tips for eco-conscious tourists:

Choose Eco-Friendly Airlines: Opt for airlines like Emirates and Delta, which are committed to reducing their environmental impact. Look for airlines that offer carbon offset programs and invest in fuel-efficient aircraft.

Stay at Green Resorts: When booking accommodations, look for hotels and resorts that have been certified as eco-friendly. Many luxury resorts are now implementing sustainable practices, such as using renewable energy, reducing waste, and supporting local communities.

Pack Light: By packing light, you can help reduce the weight of your luggage, which can lower the carbon emissions associated with your flight. Traveling with less also reduces the need for excessive baggage handling and storage.

Support Local Communities: Choose destinations and resorts that actively support local communities and contribute to environmental conservation. Many eco-resorts in France, Spain, and Thailand focus on sustainable development that benefits both the environment and the local population.

Respect Nature: Be mindful of your environmental impact while traveling. Avoid littering, respect wildlife, and follow local regulations for preserving natural habitats.

Flight Details and Travel Logistics

For those looking to experience eco-tourism in France, Spain, and Thailand, several airlines offer direct flights to these destinations with eco-friendly services. Emirates provides frequent flights from major U.S. cities like New York and Los Angeles to Paris, Madrid, and Bangkok, with options to reduce your carbon footprint through carbon offset programs. Delta Airlines also offers direct flights from major U.S. hubs to these cities, with sustainable initiatives on board to make your travel experience as eco-friendly as possible.

When planning your eco-tourism adventure, consider the environmental impact of your travel choices. Opt for flights that offer carbon offset programs, choose airlines with sustainable initiatives, and select accommodations that prioritize environmental responsibility.

France, Spain, and Thailand are leading the way in the booming luxury eco-tourism market, set to explode between 2025 and 2032. As global travelers increasingly seek sustainable, high-end experiences, these countries are becoming hotspots for eco-conscious tourists, with airlines like Emirates and Delta gearing up to meet the rising demand for green travel.

Tesla, Alphabet, Micron?
More reading 5 Stocks For Trying To Build Wealth After 50 One Top Growth Stock from the Motley Fool James Fox has positions in Alphabet, Nvidia and Micron.
The Motley Fool UK has recommended Alphabet, Nvidia, and Tesla.","Over the past five years, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has gone from a relative unknown for UK investors to one of the most common holdings. It’s the largest listed company in the world and represents 8% of the S&P 500‘s total market capitalisation.

The important question for investors is whether the stock is worth buying for 2026? The stock has pulled back in recent weeks following its earnings report, which was initially very well received. However, the market ebbs and flows, and now it’s ebbing.

For me, and for most investors, the first thing to consider is the valuation. And it’s certainly not expensive. The stock is trading around 23.4 times forward earnings (rolling basis — the next 12 months). That means it’s trading in line with the average for the information technology sector.

Then, we should address the growth-adjusted valuation and the balance sheet. Well, earnings growth averaged over the medium term is forecasted to be around 37%. That gives us a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.6. That’s a massive discount to the sector average at 1.7.

And the balance sheet? Well that’s rock solid. The business has a net cash position worth around $50bn. It’s so rich it could buy most of the companies on the FTSE 100 in cash.

What’s more, analysts are continuing to push their forecasts for Nvidia’s earnings upwards. This should reflect potential big orders from China that hadn’t previously been accounted for given the ban on exporting its AI-enabling chips there.

The risks, as far as I’m concerned are about the competitor landscape and whether AI becomes less dependent on Nvidia’s GPUs. It’s possible, but there aren’t many signs of that so far.

What’s cheaper than Nvidia?

Investors considering Nvidia may also be looking at other big tech stocks like Tesla, Alphabet, and Micron. Personally, I own the latter two, but wouldn’t consider Tesla right now, and here’s why.

It all comes down to that valuation starting point. Tesla has grand plans to dominate the autonomous driving era. However, that growth is very hard to forecast and it’s very hard to say Tesla will definitely dominate the autonomous era.

And because of that, it’s just incredibly hard to justify the valuation. It trades at 283 times forward earnings with a PEG ratio of 8.7. That’s a figure that doesn’t give us a margin of safety.

Alphabet and Micron, on the other hand, still interest me. Alphabet has been on one hell of a run following strong results and reports that it will sell its ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, which are custom-designed computer chips) to peers.

However, with a PEG ratio around 1.8, I’m probably not going to add more in the near term.

Micron still looks cheap to me. It trades around 10.8 times forward earnings. Yes, it’s a traditionally cyclical stock, but AI is a secular trend. The PEG ratio sits around 0.4.

In short, Micron might be cheaper than Nvidia. But they’re impossible to compare perfectly. I think both are worth considering.

Prudential plc Announces Completion of USD 2 Billion Share Buyback Programme

Key Highlights for Investors

Completion of Major Buyback: Prudential plc has confirmed the successful completion of its USD 2 billion share buyback programme, with the third and final tranche of USD 500 million concluded as of 24 December 2025.

Substantial Capital Return: The company repurchased a total of 36,881,649 ordinary shares in the latest tranche at a volume weighted average price of 1,012.7 pence per share, amounting to approximately £373.5 million (USD 0.5 billion).

Aggregate Effect: Across all tranches in 2025, Prudential has returned USD 1.3 billion to shareholders, and share buybacks in the year have led to a reduction of 120 million shares in issued share capital, representing roughly 4.5% of the company’s total shares outstanding at the start of the year.

Future Buybacks: The company has signaled its intention to continue returning capital to shareholders, with plans for a further buyback programme to commence in early 2026. Details will be announced in due course.

Important Information for Shareholders

Share Capital Reduction: The buyback programme results in a significant reduction of share capital (4.5%), enhancing the per share value for remaining shareholders and potentially supporting share price appreciation through earnings accretion and improved return metrics.

Price Sensitivity: Completion of such a large-scale buyback may be viewed positively by the market, as it signals management’s confidence in the company’s future prospects and its commitment to shareholder returns. This may be a price-sensitive event.

Ongoing Capital Management: Investors should note that further buybacks are anticipated early in 2026, which could continue to support the share price and improve capital efficiency.

Listings and Accessibility: Prudential maintains dual primary listings in Hong Kong (HKEX: 2378) and London (LSE: PRU), as well as secondary listings in Singapore (SGX: K6S) and New York (NYSE: PUK, ADR form). The shares are also included in major trading schemes such as the Shenzhen-Hong Kong and Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect programmes, increasing liquidity and access for global investors.

Clarification on Corporate Identity: Prudential plc is not affiliated with Prudential Financial, Inc. of the US, nor with The Prudential Assurance Company Limited, which is a subsidiary of M&G plc, UK.

Company Overview

Prudential plc provides life and health insurance and asset management services across Greater China, ASEAN, India, and Africa.

Production data published by the Department for Transport (DfT) covering most of 2025 shows that sustainable fuels (SAF) only accounted for 1.6% of fuel supplied for UK flights – 20% less fuel in volume than the 2% needed to fulfil the requirement.

The government introduced the mandate in January, which requires suppliers to hit targets for SAF – which the industry has argued is important for cutting its carbon emissions – within the overall UK aviation fuel mix.

Themandatory target rises sharply from 2% in 2025 to 10% in 2030 and then to 22% in 2040, including the use of second-generation fuels that are seen as more sustainable in the long term.

So far, the supply of SAF has been exclusively produced from recycled cooking oil from Asia, predominantly China, the DfT figures showed.

The data shows that a little more than 160m litres (35m gallons) of SAF was used, out of 10bn litres of jet fuel burned in UK flying until early October.

The DfT said the time needed for verification meant that the figures were provisional, and final figures for the year were not expected to be published until November 2026. A spokesperson for the department said: “These figures do not present the full picture. SAF volumes are continuously rising and not all suppliers have reported on the fuel they’ve supplied.”

Planes burning SAF still emit equal amounts of CO2 in flight, but the net carbon footprint is calculated as far lower because of how SAF is produced, compared with normal jet fuel. Although many scientists and environmental groups remain deeply sceptical that it can be delivered, production and uptake of SAF is seen as the only way for commercial, and particularly long-haul, aviation to reduce its emissions.

While the government has backed aviation as a driver of economic growth and granted permission for airports including Gatwick and Luton to rapidly expand, ministers have promised to consult the Climate Change Committee over plans to build a third runway at Heathrow.

The aviation minister, Keir Mather, told an industry conference in London earlier this month that Heathrow expansion would still have to meet Labour’s four tests, including reducing its climate impact, but that decarbonisation would be “a licence for growth”.

He said that SAF represented the biggest opportunity, and the government’s SAF bill, which is passing through the House of Lords, “will deliver the revenue-certainty mechanism that you called for – a guaranteed price for SAF that reduces risks for investors and raises confidence for producers”.

Heathrow airport has pushed the uptake of SAF with an incentive scheme that cuts landing charges for airlines using cleaner fuel. It expects to meet its own target of 3% SAF use over the course of 2025.

However, airlines have fewer available supplies outside larger hub airports, and have questioned whether future mandates can be met – especially when costlier second-generation and power-to-liquid SAF, yet to be produced at scale, are mandated.

The UK has progressed further than most in global aviation. The international airlines body Iata recently warned that growth in production worldwide was stalling, with SAF supplying only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, and forecast to increase to 0.8% in 2026.

Iata’s director general, Willie Walsh, criticised the mandates, adding: “If the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonisation of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work.”

Duncan McCourt, chief executive of the air industry body Sustainable Aviation, said: “These provisional figures show the UK is using significant quantities of SAF and we remain confident that the mandate will be met and UK aviation will use increasing quantities of SAF in the years to come.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30b0b29f34c77fae628a74099b3db1b1598a2d4c/372_0_4982_3985/master/4982.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e3ad7a3b815587c865dea41adc588d5c",N,,2025-12-26 03:11:44.572914

Inisiatif ini diluncurkan pada 15 Desember 2025 di kantor-kantor RW 03, RW 09, dan RW 10 di kompleks perumahan umum Cilincing. Menargetkan wanita usia subur, program ini dirancang sebagai upaya preventif untuk meningkatkan kesadaran serta akses terhadap layanan kesehatan penting, khususnya kesehatan reproduksi, sebagai fondasi bagi keluarga sehat dan generasi masa depan.

Manajer CSR Apical, Sugiantoro, menyatakan bahwa kerja sama ini mencerminkan pendekatan jangka panjang perusahaan dalam kesehatan masyarakat yang bersifat preventif.

“Kami percaya bahwa wanita sehat adalah pilar keluarga yang kuat dan kekuatan utama dalam membentuk komunitas yang sehat. Melalui keterlibatan PT AAJ, kami bertujuan menciptakan dampak nyata dengan memprioritaskan pencegahan sejak dini, bukan hanya fokus pada pengobatan semata,” ujarnya.

Fokus utama inisiatif ini adalah deteksi dini kanker serviks, penyakit serius yang sejatinya dapat dicegah bila terdeteksi melalui skrining rutin dan intervensi tepat waktu. Layanan yang disediakan meliputi pemeriksaan IVA (visual inspection with acetic acid) dan tes HPV (human papillomavirus).

Dr. Kezia Ivana dari Puskesmas Cilincing menjelaskan bahwa skrining IVA dan HPV merupakan metode efektif untuk mendeteksi kanker serviks pada tahap awal.

“Deteksi dini memungkinkan kami mengidentifikasi virus penyebab kanker serviks lebih cepat, sehingga risiko perkembangan penyakit dapat diminimalkan. Jika terdeteksi lebih awal, peluang kesembuhan sangat tinggi. Namun, jika tidak terdeteksi, kanker serviks dapat menyebabkan nyeri hebat, pendarahan abnormal, gangguan ginjal dan saluran kemih, pembengkakan kaki, serta masalah kesuburan yang dapat menghambat wanita memiliki anak,” jelasnya.

Partisipasi Apical dalam inisiatif ini sejalan dengan filosofi 5C perusahaan, yang menyatakan bahwa setiap tindakan harus bermanfaat bagi Komunitas, Negara, Iklim, dan Pelanggan, dan barulah kemudian bermanfaat bagi Perusahaan. Filosofi ini menjadi dasar komitmen Apical terhadap pertumbuhan inklusif dan berkelanjutan.

Melalui kemitraan dengan pemangku kepentingan lokal, Apical, anggota kelompok perusahaan RGE yang didirikan oleh Sukanto Tanoto, terus mendukung upaya pemerintah dalam menangani stunting sekaligus berkontribusi pada peningkatan kesejahteraan sosial dan kesehatan wanita, khususnya di komunitas di sekitar area operasionalnya.

Tourism faces struggle to recover in 2026

Narumon Kasemsuk

After a dramatic decline this year, Thai tourism may face an uphill battle to recover in 2026 as the same challenges are expected to persist.

In a bid to restore confidence in a sector hobbled by safety concerns, including grey businesses using Thailand as a transit hub, natural disasters and border disputes, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) is under pressure to address negative perceptions.

The main challenge is addressing the root causes of these concerns.

The agency plans to kick off 2026 by leveraging the global fame of Thai pop star Lalisa Manoban, recently appointed as the ""Amazing Thailand Ambassador"", to promote tourism in the country.

In addition, the concept of ""New Thailand"" will be introduced alongside the existing campaign dubbed ""Healing is the New Luxury"", aiming to encourage travellers to seek meaningful journeys through more valuable products and experiences.

TAT governor Thapanee Kiat- phaibool said the agency recognises the intense competition among Asian nations to attract tourists from the same target markets.

Rather than relying on price-driven strategies, the TAT intends to raise expectations by prioritising value over volume, she said.

""We are in the process of finalising the main concept of 'New Thailand' to showcase to international markets next year,"" said Ms Thapanee. ""In 2026, we will launch an exciting promotional project featuring Lisa. Marketing materials, including TV commercials, have been completed and await the official launch at the end of January.""

As of Dec 21, foreign tourist arrivals have contracted by 7.25% this year, mirroring a decline in the second half of the year.

When comparing monthly arrivals with the corresponding period in 2024, only January recorded growth, thanks to strong long-haul markets during the high season, before the Chinese actor Wang Xing was abducted from Thailand to Myanmar and became a viral story.

Thailand urged to go green to attract data centres

Suchit Leesa-nguansuk

Thailand can become a trusted, sustainable digital hub for Southeast Asia by investing in renewable energy and leveraging its geopolitical neutrality, regulatory stability and green credentials to position itself as a secure destination for sovereign cloud and advanced digital services, says consulting firm Deloitte.

According to a Deloitte study, Southeast Asia's total data centre capacity is expected to more than quadruple, from 1.68 gigawatts in 2024 to 7.59GW in the long term.

Thailand has a committed long-term supply of 619 megawatts, with 111MW operational and another 61MW set to come online by 2028.

Based on committed capacity, Thailand ranks as the region's fifth-largest data centre hub, trailing Singapore (3,221MW), Malaysia (2,782MW), Indonesia (1,519MW) and Vietnam (642MW).

""Thailand is at an inflection point for accelerating AI [artificial intelligence] adoption, rising cloud demand, and semiconductor momentum creating a multi-billion-dollar opportunity for the country to become a regional digital hub, especially for northern Southeast Asia,"" Piyush Jain, technology, media and telecom industry strategy, risk and transactions leader at Deloitte Southeast Asia, told the Bangkok Post.

The country has strong local demand, with rapid AI use across enterprise automation, manufacturing, logistics and smart cities creating an immediate need for onshore graphics processing unit capacity and low latency inference services.

Thailand can capture both domestic workloads and a growing share of regional traffic, he said.

As Southeast Asian markets differentiate -- Singapore on connectivity, Malaysia on cost, Taiwan and South Korea on chipmaking -- Thailand can carve its niche with AI-ready infrastructure, sovereign cloud zones, and compliance-driven services for regional demand, according to Deloitte.

Tighter data regulations and shifting geopolitics are making sovereign cloud and certified data zones increasingly attractive.

Thailand can capitalise on this by offering compliant, audited cloud services for finance, healthcare and the public sector, Mr Jain said.

With rising demand for data localisation and regulatory alignment, sovereign cloud tailored to government and regulated industries is a strategic opportunity, he said.

""Thailand's regulatory stability and strategic location give it an edge. With strong sustainability and compliance, it can secure a solid niche in Southeast Asia's booming AI and data centre market,"" said Mr Jain.

However, he warned that Thailand must embed sustainability in its digital growth to stay competitive and avoid others' mistakes.

Data centres and AI clusters consume vast amounts of energy and water. AI workloads use up to 10 times more power than standard cloud apps. Without careful planning, rapid expansion could strain the grid, raise emissions, and worsen water stress in the Eastern Economic Corridor, Mr Jain said.

Electricity demand for data centres worldwide is projected to grow by 16% in 2025 and to double by 2030, according to Gartner Inc, a business and technology insights company.

Gartner analysts estimate worldwide data centre power consumption will rise from 448 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2025 to 980TWh by 2030.

""While conventional servers and supporting infrastructure contribute to data centre electricity consumption, the rapid rise of AI-optimised servers is fuelling the increase in power consumption,"" said Linglan Wang, research director at Gartner.

""Their electricity usage is set to rise nearly fivefold, from 93TWh in 2025 to 432TWh in 2030.""

Thailand's data centre service business is expected to post 14.2 billion baht in revenue in 2026, rising 9% from an estimated 13.1 billion in 2025, according to Kasikorn Research Center (K-Research).

The market is mainly driven by demand in financial, wholesale retail and healthcare sectors, said K-Research.

On Dec 11 of this year, the Board of Investment approved 11 data centre projects worth 188 billion baht.

Pundits see 2026 as pivotal for digital assets

Nuntawun Polkuamdee

Digital asset pundits expect 2026 to mark a decisive shift from speculation towards real-world adoption, with stablecoins, tokenised assets and new digital finance models emerging as the core drivers of growth.

Traders insist the sector is entering a more mature phase, shaped by regulatory clarity, institutional participation and deeper integration with the traditional financial system.

""2025 has been a year of structural transition for the crypto market, evolving from being largely driven by speculation to increasing support from clearer rules, stronger participants and more robust technology,"" said Panuwit Taiyanon, senior investment consultant at digital asset advisory Merkle Capital.

Institutional investors and capital market-linked investment products have played a critical role in stabilising the market, shifting investor focus to fundamentals rather than short-term price volatility.

One of the most significant developments this year was regulatory progress, particularly around stablecoins, which are increasingly viewed not just as crypto assets, but as essential financial infrastructure, he said.

""Stablecoins now serve as a critical bridge between traditional finance and digital assets, improving cross-border payments, on-chain settlement and capital efficiency. This foundation is vital for the long-term expansion of the digital asset ecosystem,"" Mr Panuwit said.

Technology is another key pillar, with major upgrades to core blockchain networks, especially Ethereum, improving transaction capacity, reducing costs and supporting rapid growth. These improvements are accelerating Web3 development and expanding real-world use cases across finance and digital services, he said.

Looking ahead to 2026, liquidity is expected to be the main catalyst for the next phase of market growth.

""As global monetary policy gradually eases, capital conditions are becoming more supportive. Traditional financial institutions are expanding their presence on-chain, particularly through the tokenisation of conventional assets such as government bonds and money market funds,"" said Mr Panuwit.

This shift is expected to unlock new efficiencies in capital management and attract significant inflows from traditional finance into digital markets, he noted.

Mr Panuwit said the next phase of the crypto market will not be characterised by broad-based rallies across all tokens.

Instead, he said it will be an era of selective growth, where investors prioritise projects with clear real-world use cases, sustainable business models and alignment with evolving global regulations.

Nirun Fuwattananukul, chief executive of Binance TH by Gulf Binance, echoed this view, calling 2026 a transition towards real-world utility.

""Digital assets are moving beyond being purely investment concepts and are increasingly embedded in everyday economic activity,"" said Mr Nirun.

He highlighted three major drivers: regulatory advancement in Thailand that enables greater institutional participation; deeper integration between traditional finance and blockchain; and the expansion of stablecoins alongside tokenisation.

From a policy perspective, Nares Laopannarai, president of the Thai Digital Asset Association, called on the government to position Thailand among the world's top 10 digital asset markets.

""Clearer regulations could support crypto tourism and attract foreign investors, while strengthening Thailand's potential to become a regional hub,"" he said.

Regulatory momentum is already visible. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the Tourist DigiPay sandbox project, allowing foreign tourists to use cryptocurrencies for payments under strict anti-money laundering controls.

The 18-month pilot project starting in November 2025 allows wallet top-ups of up to 500,000 baht per month per account.

Market analysts estimate 5% of tourists may participate, generating crypto-based spending of roughly 66 billion baht during the project.

Analysts agree 2026 will be defined less by hype and more by utility, infrastructure and sustainable growth, positioning digital assets as an increasingly integral part of the global financial system.

Gold price growth set to moderate in coming year

Nareerat Wiriyapong

Gold prices, which skyrocketed by about 70% this year due partly to speculation, are expected to ease in 2026 but continue an upward trend, backed by intensified geopolitical conflicts and strong central bank buying, say traders.

Jitti Tangsithpakdi, president of Thailand's Gold Trader Association, said he expects bullion to notch a fresh all-time high in the first quarter of 2026 before hitting US$4,700-4,900 an ounce later in the year.

Domestic prices could potentially surpass 70,000 baht per baht-weight next year if the baht is not ""too strong"", he said.

Prices of gold, traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset, reached a new record high of $4,525 earlier this week amid a combination of global uncertainties, including US-China trade tensions, a weakening US dollar, and continued purchases from global central banks to diversify their reserves.

""The gold price soared by only about 8-9% 40 years earlier before it increased by nearly 30% last year. For the year-to-date, gold jumped by roughly 70%, and in October alone, it leaped 70%,"" said Mr Jitti.

""This was unprecedented, unusual and too much of an increase, due mainly to speculation.""

According to Thanarat Pasawongse, chief executive of Hua Seng Heng Group, gold delivered a return of 67% compared with the end of 2024 -- the highest level in 46 years.

Domestic gold prices in Thailand peaked at 67,400 baht per baht-weight, rising 59%.

Looking ahead to 2026, although gold prices are already at elevated levels, supporting factors remain for further increases, he said.

""However, returns may not be as high as in 2025, with global gold prices potentially reaching $4,700 an ounce by year-end 2026,"" said Mr Thanarat.

According to outlooks from 11 leading global financial institutions, gold prices in 2026 could rise to $4,500-5,000 per ounce if three conditions occur simultaneously: uncertainty over trade tariff retaliation measures, increased gold purchases by central banks to bolster reserves, and political interference in the Federal Reserve, which could affect US interest rate trends.

The surging US public debt and the global push towards reducing reliance on the US dollar or de-dollarisation are additional factors supporting global gold prices, said Mr Thanarat.

Although gold delivered exceptionally high returns this year, it is fundamentally a long-term portfolio enhancer, not an asset that yields over 60% annually, he said.

Investors are advised not to rush into gold at elevated prices, but rather to gradually accumulate when prices correct to the range of $3,700-3,800 an ounce, said Mr Thanarat.

""The $3,700-3,800 range per ounce is considered appropriate for gradual accumulation,"" he said.

Market research indicates gold consumption among Thai investors has shifted, with more purchases of gold bars for savings, while demand for gold jewellery has declined.

The average age of gold investors changed to 20-30 years, compared with past eras when people began investing at 40 or older after accumulating sufficient savings to buy gold bars.

Thanks to easier access to diverse gold investment platforms, investors can choose gold exchange-traded funds through electronic channels that enable real-time trading.

This convenience has accelerated trading activities, in turn contributing to greater volatility in gold prices, noted traders.

Power bills predicted to decrease

Yuthana Praiwan

Gas prices are likely to remain a dominant factor in determining power bills in 2026, resulting in cheaper electricity prices for households and businesses.

The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) resolved to reduce the power tariff, which is used to calculate power bills, by 0.06 baht per kilowatt-hour (unit) to 3.88 baht a unit.

The existing tariff rate is 3.94 baht a unit, applicable between September and December.

ERC secretary-general Poonpat Leesombatpaiboon attributed the lower rate, to be enforced from January to April next year, to PTT Plc's projection of lower gas prices.

Gas, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), makes up 60% of the fuels used for power generation in Thailand. The country is becoming more dependent on LNG imports as the domestic gas supply dwindles, but LNG prices are volatile.

The national oil and gas conglomerate expects LNG prices to decrease from US$12.5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at the end of September to $11.6 per mmBtu from January to April 2026.

This projected decline enabled the ERC to reduce the power tariff for the first four months of next year.

However, LNG prices are not expected to decrease significantly in 2026, according to the International Energy Agency.

Analysts expect a more balanced market as new supply comes online, but strong demand, especially for power generation and expanding exports, will likely keep prices firm rather than falling.

Despite lower LNG prices, the decrease in the power tariff is limited because a portion of electricity bills are needed to reimburse the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat).

The ERC has to pay money to Egat monthly to help the authority deal with a financial imbalance caused by its previous electricity price subsidy programme.

Another portion of power bills must be allocated to PTT, which also implemented an electricity price subsidy scheme.

Green aviation fuel rules enforced next week

Yuthana Praiwan

Thailand's first standard for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is slated for enforcement from Jan 1, 2026, setting a new trend of using greener fuel in the aviation industry to reduce its carbon footprint, says the Department of Energy Business.

The move comes as the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand signed a memorandum of understanding on SAF promotion with eight airlines last month, aiming to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and help the government achieve carbon neutrality, a balance between carbon dioxide emissions and absorption, by 2050.

The airlines are Thai Airways, Bangkok Airways, Vietjet Thailand, K-Mile Air, Nok Air, Thai AirAsia, Thai AirAsia X and Thai Lion Air.

The aircraft biofuel SAF produces up to 80% less greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fuel, according to media reports citing various forecasts.

The guidelines used for SAF manufacturing in Thailand are based on international standards and cover neat SAF, Jet A-1 and a mixture of neat SAF and jet fuel, said Sarawut Kaewtathip, director-general of the department.

Neat SAF refers to pure SAF, while Jet A-1 is a kerosene-type aviation fuel used commercially by aircraft.

Vietjet Thailand is the first low-cost Thai carrier to operate flights with a 1% blend of SAF.

The airline's flight from Bangkok to Phu Quoc in Vietnam marked the start of SAF blend use on Nov 6.

Following the International Civil Aviation Organization's standards, Vietjet Thailand aims to use an SAF blending of 5% for all routes by 2030, helping to reduce carbon emissions by 153,000 tonnes over the next six years.

Even though SAF costs more than twice the price of Jet A-1, it should not significantly impact passenger airfares as the blending portion is only 1%, said Woranate Laprabang, chief executive of Vietjet Thailand.

Bangkok Airways started using the SAF blend for its international flights from Suvarnabhumi airport since July 1 under a pilot project in collaboration with PTT Oil and Retail Business Plc (OR).

Thailand has two major SAF manufacturers: Bangchak Corporation produces neat SAF, while PTT Global Chemical (GC), the petrochemical arm of national oil and gas conglomerate PTT Plc, makes an SAF-jet oil mixture. GC's products are expected to be distributed and marketed by OR.

Both Bangchak and GC use cooking oil as a raw material to produce SAF.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20251226/c1_3163848_251226111058_700.jpg,N,,2025-12-26 03:12:14.684370

NAVI MUMBAI: Marking a long-awaited milestone for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) formally entered India’s commercial aviation map on Thursday, bringing a new dimension to air travel in the region. Developed and operated by Adani Airports Holdings Limited (AAHL), NMIA is among India’s largest greenfield airport projects and is designed to handle 90 million passengers and 3.2 million tonnes of cargo annually at full build-out. Its inaugural day saw 48 flights connecting nine domestic destinations, serving over 4,000 passengers, with peak traffic between 5 pm and 7 pm. The first arrival, IndiGo flight 6E460 from Bengaluru, touched down at 8 am, greeted by a ceremonial water cannon salute, while the first departure was an IndiGo flight to Hyderabad at 8.40 am. Chairman Gautam Adani welcomed passengers from the inaugural flight and joined a ceremonial walk through the departure terminal with employees, community representatives, and beneficiaries of the Adani Foundation.

AI-driven passenger experience

NMIA promises a seamless, AI-powered journey from entry to boarding—a leap ahead of Mumbai’s T1 and T2 terminals. Highlights include:

Digi Yatra-enabled entry from airport gates to boarding.

Fast-track immigration when international operations begin in March 2026.

AI-based passenger flow tracking, showing live waiting times at entry, security, and immigration.

AI-powered surveillance to identify passengers needing medical or special assistance.

Passengers on Day 1 experienced some teething troubles, with unclear road signages causing delays, and approach roads under repair. Most travelers opted for app-based cabs, though Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport has launched bus services on five routes.

Infrastructure & operations

Terminal 1: 3 lakh sq m, capacity 20 million passengers/year; cargo 0.8 million tonnes/year; expected saturation by mid-2026.

Runways: Two parallel (operational 08–26), 3.7 km long, with rapid exit taxiways.

Aircraft & Gates: 42 slots, 29 aerobridges, 13 remote bays; 70 general aviation stands and 17 GA hangars.

Fuel & Sustainability: First Indian airport to offer SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) for GA aircraft; 17 MW solar power in Phase 1, rising to 47 MW.

Cultural performances featuring Maharashtrian lezim, dhol, and tutari added a local flavour, while underprivileged families and first-time flyers enjoyed a special aerial tour of Mumbai. “This airport establishes a resilient multi-airport system for MMR, boosting capacity, enhancing passenger experience, and futureproofing the region’s aviation growth,” said Jeet Adani, director, AAHL. Despite the distance—around 35 km from Matunga and Dadar—passengers expressed excitement at finally seeing a second airport for Mumbai after decades of constraints. NMIA’s debut, powered by technology and innovation, promises to redefine air travel for Mumbai, blending efficiency, sustainability, and passenger convenience.

Ultimately, the A321XLR does not render widebody aircraft obsolete.","The Airbus A321XLR has ignited considerable discussion within the aviation industry even before its widespread deployment. Since its introduction, the aircraft has been perceived in two primary ways: as a natural progression in the development of narrowbody jets and as a potential challenger to the entrenched role of widebody aircraft on international routes. Central to this debate is the question of whether the A321XLR can supplant widebody aircraft.

Redefining Long-Haul Narrowbody Operations

The straightforward answer is that the A321XLR will not replace widebody aircraft across all long-haul operations. Rather, it provides airlines with a new operational model, enabling profitable service on long-haul routes with fewer passengers. This capability removes the previous necessity to deploy widebodies on routes where their size and capacity were not the most efficient choice. This nuance explains both the enthusiasm and the uncertainty surrounding the aircraft’s potential impact.

In practical terms, the A321XLR allows airlines to maintain nonstop service on routes that attract between 180 and 220 passengers, depending on cabin layout. Widebody aircraft, by contrast, generally require a minimum of 250 to 300 daily travelers to justify their deployment. Although this difference may appear marginal, it can be decisive in determining whether a route is commercially viable or remains unserved. Historically, airlines often operated widebodies on routes with insufficient demand, constrained more by aircraft range limitations than by passenger numbers. The A321XLR alleviates this constraint, facilitating more direct flights between secondary cities and unlocking new market opportunities.

Limitations and Market Positioning

Despite its advantages, the A321XLR’s ability to replace widebodies is constrained by several factors. Its range, while exceptional for a narrowbody, does not match that of traditional widebody jets such as the Boeing 777 or Airbus A350. Consequently, the A321XLR is primarily suited to medium-haul and select transatlantic routes rather than the longest intercontinental sectors. Cargo capacity also remains a significant differentiator. Widebodies like the Airbus A330, Boeing 787, and Boeing 777 generate substantial belly cargo revenue, which is often critical to the profitability of long-haul routes—an area where the A321XLR cannot compete.

The adoption of the A321XLR by American Airlines for transcontinental and transatlantic services reflects a strategic shift toward more premium seating configurations and operational flexibility. Nonetheless, market responses have been cautious amid ongoing economic uncertainties and subdued international travel demand. Competitor reactions have been measured, as the A321XLR’s strengths are concentrated in medium-haul markets, leaving widebodies to retain dominance on high-demand, long-haul routes.

Ultimately, the A321XLR does not render widebody aircraft obsolete. Instead, it reshapes the economics of long-haul air travel by enabling airlines to better align capacity with demand and to inaugurate nonstop routes that were previously unfeasible. The aircraft’s true significance lies in its role as a complement to widebody operations, expanding the strategic options available to airlines as they navigate evolving market dynamics.",https://pub-a51e4d676a044eb380faeff15def343e.r2.dev/3ddd5e4ac34b440db7a231c3598fb0d8.avif,N,,2025-12-25 22:11:52.480787

By Chinelo Obogo

talktonelo@yahoo.com

Even with a few little gains recorded this year, Nigeria’s aviation sector is still navigating a tempest, bogged down by legacy issues, heavy taxes and operational bottlenecks.

The issue has left airlines struggling to soar and passengers facing a bumpy ride and high tickets.

Stakeholders have assessed the sector’s performance and outlined priorities for 2026. Those who spoke to Daily Sun painted a picture of an industry that has recorded some progress but remains weighed down by deep-rooted challenges.

The government recorded modest gains in stabilising the sector, particularly with the signing of a Practice Direction that has enabled domestic airlines to acquire aircraft on dry lease. It also resolved the long-standing blocked funds crisis that had wiped out nearly half of Nigeria’s international travel market. Domestic airlines are equally making strategic moves, including United Nigeria Airlines’ partnership with Canada’s Cronos Aviation to establish a Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility, and Air Peace’s groundbreaking ceremony for its own MRO facility in Lagos.

However, stakeholders say these gains have yet to translate into meaningful operational improvements. The Boeing simulator at the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT) remains unused, resulting in an estimated annual revenue loss of $4 million. Domestic airlines continue to operate under what they describe as an unsustainable tax burden involving more than 18 different charges. Foreign airlines still reject naira transactions despite currency stabilisation, while Nigeria lacks a true hub airport, losing transit revenue to smaller African countries.

While stakeholders have offered clear recommendations for 2026, they insist progress will ultimately depend on government action.

Unused Boeing 737 simulator

One lingering concern is why the Boeing 737NG aircraft simulator installed at NCAT, Zaria, five years ago remains non-operational. The equipment, originally scheduled for delivery in December 2016, was delayed due to late payments and eventually delivered in 2020.

Industry analysts estimate Nigeria could save up to $4 million annually on pilot training if the simulator were operational, while also eliminating the cost of international travel incurred when airlines send pilots abroad for training.

Gains

The National President of the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agents (NANTA), Yinka Folami, told Daily Sun that despite persistent challenges, the aviation sector recorded “remarkable gains” in 2025, particularly in strengthening local capacity.

He commended the government and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for reforms that have stabilised the exchange rate, converged forex windows, improved liquidity, enhanced transparency and restored market confidence. According to him, resolving airline fund repatriation issues marked a major breakthrough after billions of naira belonging to foreign airlines were trapped in Nigeria, prompting threats of reduced operations.

“The repatriation crisis that threatened international connectivity has been resolved. International airlines are successfully repatriating funds, confirming the success of government intervention. The CBN and fiscal authorities deserve commendation,” Folami said.

Foreign airlines keep raking in dollars from Nigeria

However, Folami noted that despite naira stability, three foreign airlines still insist on selling tickets exclusively in dollars, contrary to Nigerian law.

NANTA data shows dollar-only sales exclude about 70 per cent of IATA and NANTA-certified members, limiting travel agents’ access to direct ticket sales. He urged the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), Nigerian Tourism Development Authority (NTDA) and the Nigeria Hotel and Tourism Institute (NIHOTOUR) to investigate and sanction erring airlines.

“If naira sales are accommodated, over 70 per cent of Nigerian travel agencies will regain direct market access,” he said.

Multiple charges and taxes

Domestic airlines face a different challenge. Prof. Obiora Okonkwo, spokesperson of the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) and chairman of United Nigeria Airlines, said domestic carriers pay over 18 different charges and levies to operate.

He explained that airlines pay for almost every interaction with regulatory agencies, creating a heavy financial burden that undermines growth and competitiveness.

“For the umpteenth time, domestic airlines have cried out over multiple taxes that have kept them on life support. We call on the federal government to intervene before we are taxed to death,” Okonkwo said.

He added that lack of affordable financing remains the most pressing challenge, as Nigerian airlines face high borrowing costs compared to international counterparts. AON is demanding single-digit interest loans and a special foreign exchange window.

Lack of a hub airport

Aviation experts say Nigeria’s most glaring infrastructure gap is the absence of a major hub airport. Despite a population of over 200 million, the country lacks a hub built around major carriers, leading to significant revenue losses.

Air Peace Chairman, Allen Onyema, highlighted the issue at the 29th League of Airports and Aviation Correspondents (LAAC) Conference in August 2025, citing operational challenges caused by poor transit facilities at Lagos airport.

Passengers transiting through Lagos, he explained, are forced through immigration, health checks and customs before reconnecting, discouraging future travel.

“If we give Nigerian airlines the right infrastructure, Ethiopia and others will be a thing of the past in the next 10 years,” Onyema said.

Aviation expert Amos Akpan said hub development requires deliberate government policy and collaboration with stakeholders. Essential infrastructure, he noted, includes transit lounges, hotels, cargo warehouses, trained personnel, reliable power supply, fuel availability, high-speed internet and modern aeronautical systems.

“Nigeria already has the data to justify Lagos as a hub, but success depends on deliberate planning and execution,” Akpan said.

NAAPE’s 2026 agenda

National President of the National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE), Captain Bunmi Gindeh, outlined expectations for 2026, calling for legislative and budgetary reforms to grant operational and financial autonomy to the Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau (NSIB) and NCAA.

For decades, reaching the hidden gems of the archipelago meant a tiring relay of narrow-body jets, winding road transfers, and bumpy ferry crossings. However, on December 26, 2025, the future of premium travel in Southeast Asia took a decisive leap forward. Santai Seaplane, a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based Seaplane Asia Group, officially announced that Banyuwangi Airport (BWX) in East Java will serve as its primary strategic and operational hub.

This partnership, supported by InJourney Airports and the Akademi Penerbang Indonesia (API) Banyuwangi, transforms Banyuwangi into the nerve center for amphibious aviation. By early 2026, the roar of seaplane engines will bridge the gap between Java’s volcanic peaks and Bali’s turquoise shores, offering a “last-mile” solution that turns a six-hour journey into a breathtaking 30-minute flight.

The Strategic Choice: Why Banyuwangi?

Selecting Banyuwangi as a hub was a move of geographical brilliance. Situated at the easternmost tip of Java, Banyuwangi Airport sits as the “gateway” between Indonesia’s most populous island and its most famous tourism destination, Bali.

Banyuwangi Airport itself is already a pioneer—it is Indonesia’s first “Green Airport,” designed with a sustainable, open-air concept that minimizes the need for air conditioning. By choosing this location, Santai Seaplane isn’t just picking a runway; they are aligning with an eco-conscious brand that matches their own commitment to sustainable aviation.

The Operational Blueprint:

The “Build-Operate-Transfer” Center: Santai Seaplane is developing a dedicated operations and sales center within the airport. This facility will handle everything from VIP guest lounges to high-tech flight planning.

The Water Aerodrome: While the planes will take off from the BWX runway, they are designed to land on water. The project utilizes the Banyuwangi Water Aerodrome at Pang Pang Bay, providing a seamless transition from asphalt to ocean.

Geographic Proximity: From this hub, seaplanes can reach North Bali (Menjangan), Lombok, and Moyo Island with unprecedented speed.

The Fleet: Luxury Meets Versatility

Santai Seaplane will utilise the Cessna Grand Caravan EX Amphibian, a workhorse of the sky that has been reimagined for luxury. Unlike standard aircraft, these amphibious planes are equipped with pontoons that allow them to land directly in front of waterfront resorts or on secluded lagoons.

Passenger Capacity: Up to 8 guests per flight.

The Experience: Passengers are treated to full VIP service, including air-conditioning (rare in small seaplanes), iPads with personalized content, and premium gifts.

Sightseeing Potential: The hub’s location allows for curated aerial tours. Imagine flying over the “Blue Fire” of the Ijen Crater or the smoking peaks of Mount Bromo before landing in the calm waters of a Bali marina for lunch.

A Sustainable Horizon

One of the most humanized aspects of this announcement is the “Sustainable by Design” commitment. Santai Seaplane is not just adding more carbon to the atmosphere; they have outlined a four-phase roadmap to zero emissions:

Carbon Compensation: Every flight minute is currently offset through local Indonesian development programs.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): Within two years, the fleet aims to switch to biofuels.

Electrification: Partnering with companies like MagniX, Santai Seaplane is preparing to retrofit its engines for full electric power.

PHA-ZE 100: The parent company, Seaplane Asia, has already committed to 14 PHA-ZE 100 amphibious seaplanes, which are designed from the ground up to be zero-emission.

The Human Impact: More Than Just Tourism

Airfare pricing has evolved into a complex and high-stakes process, with airlines increasingly relying on sophisticated algorithms to optimize revenue by gauging what each traveler is willing to pay. Modern fares fluctuate rapidly, influenced by a multitude of factors including demand patterns, booking windows, route competition, seasonal trends, and the pace at which seats are sold on specific flights. This dynamic pricing model often leaves travelers feeling that flight shopping is unpredictable and, at times, unfair. Prices can surge unexpectedly, attractive deals may disappear within hours, and traditional tactics such as clearing cookies or using incognito browsing have proven largely ineffective.

At the core of this system are advanced revenue management platforms powered by machine learning. These platforms analyze extensive datasets encompassing booking velocity, remaining seat inventory, competitor pricing, and seasonal travel trends. The outcome is a pricing structure that can adjust multiple times daily, or even within the same hour. While this approach enables airlines to reduce unsold seats and maximize revenue, it also generates frustration among consumers due to its opacity. Two individuals searching for identical routes mere hours apart may encounter vastly different prices, despite no changes in their search behavior.

Consumer Strategies and Industry Implications

The increasing complexity of airline pricing algorithms has rendered many traditional consumer strategies obsolete. In response, a growing number of travelers are adopting AI-driven tools—not to uncover hidden fares, but to conduct more strategic and efficient searches. Rather than simply querying for the cheapest flight to a destination, savvy consumers are leveraging AI to explore alternative routes, flexible travel dates, and innovative booking strategies. For instance, some begin their search by specifying the maximum price they are willing to pay, allowing AI to recommend destinations or travel windows that align with their budget constraints.

The deployment of AI in airfare pricing has also sparked controversy and regulatory scrutiny. Airlines’ use of personal data to tailor fares has raised significant concerns regarding privacy and fairness. Reports that Delta employs AI-driven pricing on approximately 3% of its domestic flights have intensified calls from lawmakers and regulators for greater transparency. Consumers remain apprehensive about how their data is utilized and whether personalized pricing could result in discrimination or disproportionately higher costs for certain travelers.

Beyond consumer concerns, the expansion of AI infrastructure presents broader challenges for the aviation industry’s sustainability objectives. The substantial energy consumption of AI data centers increasingly competes with the renewable energy resources earmarked for sustainable aviation fuel, a critical element in airlines’ net-zero emissions strategies. The International Air Transport Association has cautioned that the rapid growth of AI technology is contributing to rising energy prices and increased CO2 emissions, potentially undermining efforts to decarbonize air travel.

For travelers navigating this evolving landscape, the environment is more complex than ever. While AI has introduced greater volatility and opacity into airfare pricing, it has simultaneously provided consumers with new tools to better manage their travel planning. Success lies in employing these tools strategically—embracing flexibility, experimenting with search parameters, and remaining informed about the technological practices shaping airline pricing. As debates over transparency and fairness continue, travelers can find some reassurance in their growing ability to adapt within the era of algorithmic airfare.",https://pub-a51e4d676a044eb380faeff15def343e.r2.dev/985c6c8ad1464c9580b5052740d317f9.avif,N,,2025-12-26 03:13:37.329144

Officials will also start using the map to assess fees on property owners in high-risk areas to help conduct assessments meant to minimize risk.

Statewide, about 60,000 structures in Utah have been deemed “high risk” for wildfires. That’s according to a new online map the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands released last week.

By plugging in their addresses to the tool called the Utah Wildfire Risk Explorer, Utahns can generate a report on how likely it is that their homes could be impacted by a wildfire. The site also suggests actions homeowners can take to better protect their property.

“Our goal is to empower homeowners, communities, fire departments, and municipalities to act in reducing their vulnerability to wildfire by giving them the necessary tools to identify and understand their wildfire risk,” the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands says on the website.

State officials were required to build the tool after the 2025 Utah Legislature passed HB48, a law meant to increase wildfire risk awareness and encourage property owners to “share the responsibility of reducing that risk” in wildland urban interface areas, or areas where homes or other structures border or mingle with undeveloped wildlands.

The Utah Legislature passed the law as wildfires in the West have increased in frequency and severity. Insurers have also raised premiums and created stricter eligibility requirements.

“Insurance availability and affordability are concerns for property owners in Utah, and many are already experiencing increased premiums or losing coverage as insurers respond to wildfire risk,” the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire & State Lands says on its website.

Under the law, which takes effect Jan. 1, property insurers are required to use the map to determine a property’s wildfire risk.

“If an insurer raises rates by 20 percent or more, or drops coverage due to wildfire risk, it must provide notice and justification based on the facts underlying the decision, if requested by the property owner,” according to the division.

The new law also requires the state to assess property fees within the high-risk wildland urban interface boundary to help support risk assessments. Utahns will only be charged a fee if they own a taxable structure within the map’s High Risk Wildland Urban Interface boundary.

Starting in 2026 and 2027, the fee will range from $20 to $100 per structure, based on square footage of taxable structures on the property, according to the division’s frequently asked questions page on HB48.

If property owners take actions to reduce their wildfire risk, the fee may be reduced, the website says.",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-12-25 15:11:44.492378

If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park.
Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel.
“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect.
Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released new estimates for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production showing that SAF production in 2025 represents only 0.6 percent of total jet fuel consumption.

This is however increasing to 0.8 percent the following year. At current price levels, the SAF premium translates into an additional USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs for the industry in 2025.

The estimated SAF output for 2025 of 1.9 Mt is a downward revision from IATA’s earlier forecasts due to lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities. SAF prices exceed fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to a factor of five in mandated markets.

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (Mt) (2.4 billion liters), double the 1 Mt produced in 2024. However, in 2026, SAF production growth is projected to slow down and reach 2.4 Mt.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park.

“But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonization of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Mandates in the EU and UK have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption:

In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have widened their profit margins to such an extent that airlines pay up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF. All this comes without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation.

The UK’s SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden.

The cumulative impact of poorly designed policy frameworks is that airlines paid a premium of USD 2.9 billion for the limited 1.9 Mt of SAF available in 2025. Of this, USD 1.4 billion reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional fuel.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognize that its approach is not working and urgently correct course. The recent European Commission STIP announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter,” said Walsh.

“The failure to accelerate the expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets. “Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10 percent SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments.

“SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” said Walsh.

With e-SAF mandates approaching in the UK (2028) and EU (2030), it’s essential not to repeat the policy missteps seen with SAF.

Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel. Without strong production incentives (as opposed to mandates), supply will fall short of targets. On top of that, compliance costs could escalate to EUR 29 billion by 2032 if targets aren’t met, as seems very likely with the current policy framework.

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect. Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down. Mandates have done just the opposite, and it is outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/2023/07/IATA-1.png,N,,2025-12-25 14:11:49.528559
