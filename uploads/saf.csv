What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is a low-carbon alternative to conventional jet fuel. It is designed to work with existing aircraft and infrastructure.

SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel. This makes it one of the fastest ways to decarbonise aviation. SAF is produced from renewable sources, including:

Agricultural waste and residues

Used cooking oils and fats

Municipal solid waste

Green hydrogen combined with captured CO₂

Unlike experimental fuels, SAF is already approved for commercial flights.

How Australian green fuel is produced

The production of Australian green fuel involves several advanced chemical pathways. The most common method currently is HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids). This process refines fats and oils into high-quality fuel. Another promising route is Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ), which uses ethanol derived from agricultural waste. Australia’s vast farming sector provides a nearly endless supply of these vital feedstocks.

Beyond biological sources, the future of Australian green fuel lies in “e-fuels.” These are synthetic fuels created by combining captured carbon dioxide with green hydrogen. Australia’s world-leading wind power and solar resources make it the perfect place for e-fuel production. By leveraging renewable energy, we can create a truly circular carbon economy. This technological edge is why global investors are pivoting aggressively to Australian green fuel in 2026.

Why aviation needs SAF now

Aviation accounts for global emissions. That figure is expected to rise without intervention. Electric planes are decades away for long-haul travel. Hydrogen aircraft are still in testing phases. SAF is the only scalable solution available right now.

Key drivers pushing SAF adoption include:

Net-zero commitments from airlines

Government mandates in Europe and the US

Carbon pricing and emissions trading schemes

Corporate pressure to decarbonise supply chains

This urgency is accelerating SAF investment worldwide.

What this means for homes and businesses

Large-scale SAF production depends on cheap renewable energy. That drives more upgrades to solar, batteries, and grid connections across Australia. Check our page for our recommended solar products.

For households and businesses, this means:

More renewable energy investment

Falling clean energy costs

Stronger case for rooftop solar and battery storage

Comparing SAF and iron ore: The economic shift

Major projects leading the Australian green fuel revolution

Several landmark projects are already proving the viability of Australian green fuel. Project Ulysses in Townsville is a prime example of this industrial evolution. It aims to convert agricultural waste into more than 100 million litres of SAF annually. Backed by Qantas and Airbus, the project shows how the entire aviation value chain is investing in Australian green fuel. It is not just a fuel project; it is a signal of industry-wide transformation.

In Queensland, the Wagner Sustainable Fuels refinery is also making headlines. This facility is designed to be modular, enabling rapid scaling as demand for Australian green fuel grows. Investors are particularly interested in these “plug-and-play” models that can be replicated nationwide. By lowering barriers to entry, Australia is accelerating the global transition. Australian green fuel is no longer a “future” concept; it is an active construction reality.

Australia as a green fuel superpower

Global investors are not just buying into a product; they are buying into a sovereign capability. Australian green fuel is the key to our future energy independence.

As more countries introduce SAF mandates, the export potential for Australian green fuel is staggering. We are perfectly positioned to supply the growing aviation hubs of Singapore, Tokyo, and Dubai. The pivot we are seeing today is the start of a multi-decade boom. Australian green fuel is indeed the “new iron ore,” and the world is taking notice.

So, is SAF the new iron ore?

All signs point to yes. With soaring global demand, unmatched renewable resources, and growing investor confidence, Australia is positioned to lead the sustainable aviation fuel revolution. This shift will reshape exports, energy systems, and regional economies. The clean energy future is arriving faster than expected. Energy Matters is ready to help Australians be part of it—right now.

‍ Queensland’s sugarcane fields could become a key source of sustainable aviation fuel, thanks to new research into plant biomass and renewable carbon.","Australia’s sugarcane industry could play a pivotal role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel, with researchers pointing to the crop’s productivity, scalability, and environmental benefits.

At the ARC Research Hub for Engineering Plants to Replace Fossil Carbon, scientists are working with global technology leaders to develop renewable aviation fuel at the scale the industry requires. Emeritus Professor Robert Henry said sugarcane offers the best chance of success.

“Our mission is ambitious: create economically viable, renewable aviation fuel at the scale this huge industry needs. Plants are the best current source for renewable carbon, and all available evidence suggests sugarcane is the plant offering the best chance of success,” Professor Henry said.

Other potential feedstocks, such as algae and canola, face significant limitations. Algal systems are expensive and difficult to scale, while canola yields are low and much of Australia’s crop is exported for fuel rather than food, raising food security concerns.

“Land use is a critical consideration. So, what crops can you scale? Sugarcane is productive and grown on a relatively small proportion of land. Its small footprint and exceptional productivity make it the standout choice,” Professor Henry explained.

The Hub’s research focuses on improving plant biomass for fuel conversion. Genetic improvements are first tested in rice, then applied to sorghum, and finally transferred to sugarcane, its closest domesticated relative. This tiered approach boosts efficiency and success rates.

Queensland’s established sugarcane industry, strong research capability, and domestic demand for aviation fuel position the state to lead the field. “The challenge now is clear: breed crops with a high proportion of convertible biomass without sacrificing yield. It’s a complex puzzle, but one worth solving. Sugarcane hits the sweet spot. It’s productive, sustainable, and scalable. If we get this right, Australia won’t just be part of the solution; we’ll be leading it,” Professor Henry said.

Satvinder Singh, Deputy Secretary-General for the ASEAN Economic Community, said the outlook confirms ASEAN’s strong supply-side advantage, particularly in sustainable bio-feedstocks, alongside rising regional and global demand for sustainable aviation fuel.
Sharmine Tan, Boeing’s regional sustainability lead for Southeast Asia, said the region’s aviation industry is expanding rapidly and will need increased supplies of sustainable aviation fuel alongside more fuel-efficient aircraft.
“The ASEAN 2050 SAF Outlook shows the region’s strong potential to increase SAF production with the right policies, partnerships, and investments,” she said.","ASEAN economies could generate up to 8.5 million barrels per day of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2050, according to the ASEAN SAF 2050 Outlook report released on January 23. The report assesses regional supply chains and demand scenarios for 2030, 2040, and 2050 across Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, as well as key import markets including Japan, Singapore, and South Korea.

The report was developed by GHD Group, a global professional services company specialising in water, energy, environment, property, and transport, with financial support from Global Affairs Canada through the Canadian Trade and Investment Facility for Development, implemented by Cowater International, with Boeing as the knowledge partner and support from the ASEAN Secretariat.

SAF is a renewable or waste-derived aviation fuel that meets sustainability criteria, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and is compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure. ASEAN’s key SAF feedstocks include used cooking oil, rice waste, cassava waste, and forestry residues.

The countries examined within the report could potentially have capacity to position themselves as net SAF exporters. Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand have the most abundant feedstock to support SAF production, while Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, may have the most cost-efficient distribution for markets in Japan, Singapore, and South Korea.

In addition to exporting SAF, ASEAN is predicted to become a significant market for SAF in its own right. The report projects that SAF demand in ASEAN will grow sharply from 15,000 barrels per day in 2030 to over 700,000 barrels per day by 2050. The largest SAF demands are expected to come from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, as well as other Asian economies such as Japan and South Korea.

The report also examined different ways of producing SAF. Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) is the most prevalent technology for producing SAF today, costing about twice as much as jet fuel, with the largest cost contributor being feedstock. Alternative methods could be between four and seven times more expensive, but this gap is expected to reduce as technologies mature and scale up.

Satvinder Singh, Deputy Secretary-General for the ASEAN Economic Community, said the outlook confirms ASEAN’s strong supply-side advantage, particularly in sustainable bio-feedstocks, alongside rising regional and global demand for sustainable aviation fuel.

“To fully capitalise on these dynamics, ASEAN member states should work together to scale up production capacity, deploy cost-effective technologies, and establish robust regional trade and market frameworks,” he said, adding that this would help position ASEAN as a competitive and reliable supplier supporting aviation decarbonisation across the Asia-Pacific.

Sharmine Tan, Boeing’s regional sustainability lead for Southeast Asia, said the region’s aviation industry is expanding rapidly and will need increased supplies of sustainable aviation fuel alongside more fuel-efficient aircraft. “The ASEAN 2050 SAF Outlook shows the region’s strong potential to increase SAF production with the right policies, partnerships, and investments,” she said.

Sachin Narang, GHD’s executive advisor for energy and infrastructure, said ASEAN’s abundance of agricultural and forestry waste could serve as low-cost feedstock for SAF, helping narrow the gap with conventional jet fuel. “Policy intervention, scaling, and innovation can further reduce costs for alternative SAF pathways over the medium to long term,” he said.",https://netzero.vn/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/boeing-777.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 22:57:00.151870

Alongside House 2, Governor Healey also filed a Fair Share supplemental budget bill to spend $1.15 billion in surplus FY25 surtax revenue on education and transportation initiatives.
Governor Healey’s budget continues to deliver on her $8 billion plan to upgrade roads, bridges and public transportation across the state.
Between House 2 and the Fair Share supplemental budget, she is proposing $3.6 billion for transportation, including $2.54 billion for the MBTA.
“House 2 is a fiscally responsible spending plan that advances our administration’s strategy of protecting the integrity of Massachusetts’ budget despite significant national economic headwinds.","Boston — Today, Governor Maura Healey filed her budget recommendation for Fiscal Year 2027 (FY27), which controls spending, protects key services, and invests in programs that residents rely on to make their lives better and more affordable.

The $62.8 billion budget, filed as House 2, does not propose any new taxes or fees and represents 1.1 percent growth over estimated FY26 spending, the lowest spending rate since taking office and well under the rate of inflation. This includes $2.7 billion in Fair Share surtax spending. Alongside House 2, Governor Healey also filed a Fair Share supplemental budget bill to spend $1.15 billion in surplus FY25 surtax revenue on education and transportation initiatives.

“This budget is about making life easier and more affordable for Massachusetts residents and businesses,” said Governor Healey. “At a time when budgets across the country are tight, this proposal maximizes our resources to deliver on what matters most while controlling spending, protecting taxpayer dollars and driving economic growth. We’re lowering costs by continuing free school meals, no-cost community college, and expanding universal pre-K. We’re fixing our roads and bridges so you can get where you need to go faster and investing in our schools so that every child gets the best education possible. While President Trump is cutting federal funding and driving up costs, we’re focused on making a positive difference in people’s lives – and we’re doing it without any new taxes.""

“We’re working every day to deliver the resources our communities need to run excellent schools, fix our roads and bridges, support our local businesses and make sure our residents are healthy,” said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. “This is a balanced budget that ensures each dollar is spent efficiently, preserves critical services, and requires no new or increased taxes or fees.”

Governor Healey's budget makes key investments that will reduce the cost of housing, transportation, education, health care and doing business in the state. It continues the Governor’s key affordability initiatives from the past few years, including her tax cuts, free school meals, no-cost community college, major transportation upgrades and her nation-leading investments in child care that have enabled over 8,000 child care programs to remain open and added over 22,000 seats statewide. This budget will also secure the necessary funding to deliver on Governor Healey’s pledge to achieve universal pre-kindergarten funding in all Gateway Cities this year. Governor Healey is also proposing $10 million for Accelerating Achievement, a new multi-year K-12 school improvement initiative focused on rapidly improving student outcomes in the state’s lowest-performing schools.

Governor Healey’s budget continues to deliver on her $8 billion plan to upgrade roads, bridges and public transportation across the state. Between House 2 and the Fair Share supplemental budget, she is proposing $3.6 billion for transportation, including $2.54 billion for the MBTA. This funding will allow the T to continue making progress on improving safety and reliability across the system, while fully addressing their projected operating deficit in FY27. Governor Healey is also investing $75 million in the new Funding for Accelerated Infrastructure Repair (FAIR) program to help municipalities work through their backlog of municipal bridges in need of repair, enabled by leveraging Fair Share as part of the Governor’s $8 billion transportation plan.

Governor Healey is also proposing new affordability initiatives. To reduce costs for Massachusetts businesses, she will create a new Workforce Productivity Fund to provide grants to small employers to help fill workforce gaps to best fit their needs. She is also simplifying the process for cancelling subscriptions, requiring companies to make it as easy to cancel as it is to sign up, and extending the ConnectorCare pilot, which expands eligibility for subsidized health insurance to individuals earning between 300 and 400 percent of the federal poverty limit. This will provide over 47,000 residents access to more affordable health insurance. Governor Healey is also proposing to create a new tax credit up to $5,000 for Massachusetts farmers that donate excess food to food banks and pantries. This will help to cut down on food waste and provide needed resources for food banks and pantries, all while supporting farmers.

Governor Healey is also fully funding the implementation of the Maternal Health Law for the first time, ensuring that Massachusetts remains a leader in advancing maternal health equity and care. And to better ensure justice for survivors of sexual assault, Governor Healey filed an outside section clarifying that all Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits (SAECKs) must be stored for a minimum of 15 years and eliminating the statute of limitations in cases of rape when a DNA match exists, allowing for prosecution beyond the 15-year statute of limitations when DNA technology has identified a suspect. The House 2 proposal would allocate $100 million for the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund, $136 million for post-retiree benefits, and $20 million for the Disaster Relief and Resiliency Fund to help the state prepare for unforeseen natural disasters. It also includes $5.131 billion for pension funding, which puts Massachusetts on a sustainable path to fully fund the state’s pension systems.

The Governor’s budget proposal controls spending and protects taxpayer dollars, particularly in response to President Donald Trump’s billions of dollars in funding cuts to Massachusetts. Not including the $2.7 billion in proposed Fair Share investments, House 2 spending growth is limited to 1.1 percent over estimated FY26 spending and 3.5 percent over the FY26 GAA.

“House 2 is a fiscally responsible spending plan that advances our administration’s strategy of protecting the integrity of Massachusetts’ budget despite significant national economic headwinds. This budget will strengthen Massachusetts' leadership in sectors like education and health care, provide for critical state programs and services, and drive down costs for residents,” said Administration and Finance Secretary Matthew J. Gorzkowicz. “As we look ahead to FY27, this budget recommendation will keep spending under control and ensure that every dollar we invest generates the maximum return for Massachusetts residents.”

Fair Share

Across House 2 and the Supplemental Budget, the administration is proposing to use a total of $3.85 billion in Fair Share revenues to continue making transformative improvements to Massachusetts’s education and transportation systems.

Fair Share Investments in House 2 and the Supplemental Budget Bill:

Local Aid

The Healey-Driscoll Administration is committed to strengthening municipal capacity statewide through robust local aid investments. In House 2, the administration recommends more than $10.4 billion in local aid, a $439 million (4 percent) increase over the FY26 GAA, in addition to fully funding the final implementation phase of the Student Opportunity Act and dedicating $7.6 billion for Chapter 70 school aid (a $242 million increase over the FY26 GAA). House 2 also proposes full funding for Charter School Reimbursements at $200.4 million, $20 million for rural school aid and the administration’s legislative package fully funds the Special Education Circuit Breaker at $802.7 million. This budget recommendation also expands the administration’s commitment to school transportation by investing an additional $154.3 million to reimburse school districts for a significant share of transportation costs.

Unrestricted General Government Aid (UGGA) supports local government functions including public safety, public works, and economic development, and remains the only fully flexible, unrestricted source of state local aid available to cities and towns. Continuing the established approach of growing UGGA in line with consensus tax revenue growth, the House 2 budget recommends $1.356 billion in funding, an increase of $33 million (2.5 percent) over the FY26 GAA.

These investments are in addition to the four-year, $1.2 billion Chapter 90 bond bill that Governor Healey filed earlier this month.

C2ES Launches Innovation Policy Matrix to Accelerate U.S. Technology Leadership and Innovation

Press Release

January 28, 2026

Media Contact: Tim Carroll at press@c2es.org.

WASHINGTON – Today, the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES) released a new tool for policymakers as U.S. innovators race to win in the new energy economy. The C2ES Innovation Policy Matrix offers a roadmap for smart, effective innovation policy, informed by over 140 start-ups, investors, Fortune 500 companies, and additional stakeholders convened over the past two years by the C2ES Technology Working Groups.

Read the full Innovation Policy Matrix here.

“America is an economic powerhouse because of our technological leadership. To keep and extend that edge in the twenty-first century, we need to double down on investment in research and innovation to rapidly scale development and commercialization of promising new energy technologies,” said C2ES President Nat Keohane. “The C2ES Innovation Policy Matrix is a dynamic tool that will help policymakers identify and address barriers that are holding back American innovators from leading our economy into the future.”

The Matrix is a user-friendly, technology-neutral tool that outlines four key components necessary for policymakers to develop a comprehensive understanding of the policy needs for any given technology and the broader innovation ecosystem. These components are designed as an intuitive four-by-four model, including: key risks, innovation process stages, ecosystem functions, and policy design principles.

Put together, this Matrix identifies where the greatest concentration of risk may be for any given technology in the innovation process, creating a heatmap for where policy need will likely be the greatest. The publication also includes a “Policymaker Guide” for applying the Matrix to better diagnose policy support, ensuring the most promising U.S. innovations can succeed.

While the Matrix is tech-neutral, it was informed by America’s leading innovators and tech stakeholders across four promising low-carbon technologies:

engineered carbon removal (ECR),

sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),

long-duration energy storage (LDES),

and clean hydrogen.

The U.S. innovation ecosystem, built on nearly a century of public and private investment, has created the world’s most dynamic economy, supported by the private sector, world-class research institutions, and robust capital markets. The U.S. can lead in a range of industries of the future if the nation’s competitive advantages are leveraged to create and scale world-class clean technologies.

Smart policy, grounded in the real-world experience of innovators, financiers, and other private sector partners, can unlock opportunities for research, development, deployment, and diffusion, as well as the private capital needed to scale these technologies and win the innovation race.

As C2ES supports legislators and policymakers in utilizing the Innovation Policy Matrix, the organization will continue to expand this framework through continued exploration of the four current technologies as well as additional critical-path clean energy technologies that emerge.

To speak with a C2ES expert, contact Tim Carroll at carrollt@C2ES.org.

About the C2ES Technology Working Groups: C2ES Technology Working Groups focus on four critical-path technologies: engineered carbon removal, sustainable aviation fuel, long-duration energy storage, and clean hydrogen. These working groups provide a regular venue where stakeholders across the innovation ecosystem can convene to discuss the technical, market, and policy solutions needed to rapidly scale these technologies.

About C2ES: The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions—or C2ES—champions policies and technologies that foster thriving economies and shared prosperity, founded on abundant, affordable, and reliable clean energy and a safe climate. Founded in 1998 as the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, C2ES is known worldwide as a thought leader and trusted convener.

The agreement marks a major step towards establishing one of India’s first grassroots, dedicated SAF production facilities utilizing ethanol as a feedstock.

Honeywell UOP’s Ethanol-to-Jet technology enables producers to convert ethanol derived from renewable sources into SAF, offering a cost-effective pathway to reduce carbon emissions of air travel. The process is easily integrated into existing ethanol production infrastructure and can also produce renewable diesel, helping reduce carbon emissions in the road transport sector.

“Our proven Ethanol-to-Jet technology provides a cost-efficient pathway for SAF production and will help TruAlt Bioenergy advance its net-zero ambitions while creating value across the agricultural and energy ecosystems,” said Ranjit Kulkarni, VP & GM – Honeywell Process Technology, India. “This agreement marks another milestone in Honeywell’s journey to help India build self-reliance in sustainable fuel production.”

The collaboration underscores Honeywell’s alignment with the Government of India’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat vision by promoting domestic biofuel production. Once operational, the project will help reduce CO₂ emissions from the rapidly growing aviation sector while also contributing to higher farmer incomes through increased demand for bioethanol.

Vijay Nirani, Managing Director of TruAlt Bioenergy Limited, said, “Our agreement with Honeywell is a defining step in TruAlt’s journey to help build India’s sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem. By leveraging Honeywell technology, we aim to create a scalable, ethanol-based SAF pathway that connects India’s farmers directly to the global aviation decarbonization agenda.

Additional price relief for European markets could come from Chinese SAF imports, as the EU currently has no antidumping duties on Chinese sustainable aviation fuel, potentially creating downward pressure on prices as supply increases.
The price difference between HEFA-based SAF and synthetic aviation fuel or eSAF is considerable.
Under the terms of the EU's ReFuel EU Aviation regulation, from the start of last year 2% of aviation fuel supplied in the EU had to be SAF.
In 2030, this jumps to 6% and then grows incrementally to 70% SAF in 2050, while eSAF must make up 0.7% of aviation fuel supplied in 2030, rising to 35% in 2050.","Sharp price swings in sustainable aviation fuel highlight the limitations of current production pathways and raise concerns about the sector's ability to expand to meet rising mandates, according to industry professionals.

The volatility in SAF prices is being amplified by the small size of the market and thin pool of suppliers, renewing concerns that today's dominant HEFA pathway will struggle to scale as mandates rise, an official at sustainable fuels developer Aether Fuels told Platts, part of S&P Global Energy.

""The capacity is limited and the number of sellers is limited, and so in those conditions, it also further magnifies the effect of hedging strategies,"" Aether's CEO Conor Madigan said. Many airlines decided to delay purchases, assuming prices might decline or wanting to postpone balance sheet impacts, he said.

Platts assessed SAF on a CIF basis in Northwest Europe at $2,286.25/metric ton Jan. 27, compared to $741/mt for jet cargoes on an equivalent basis. Platts launched the SAF assessment in September 2023, since when its standard deviation has been $444/mt compared with $95/mt for fossil-based jet, a difference of 365%.

This volatility has highlighted the limitations of current Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, the prevalent SAF production pathway, which faces scalability constraints due to limited feedstock availability.

""The SAF market remains small, early stage, and constrained by limited production capacity,"" a spokesperson for the International Air Transport Association told Platts. ""Under these circumstances, even modest changes in supply or demand can create pronounced imbalances, which in turn drive significant price volatility.""

Scaling challenges

""There's enough SAF globally to meet European demand; the problem is the step-wise increase in mandates,"" said Ina Chirita, head of short-term biofuels analytics at S&P Global Horizons. ""There is limited appetite from airlines to absorb additional SAF beyond the quotas because it is so expensive; but if you make that increase in mandates more gradual, then you can leave more space for more projects to come online.""

Sudden jumps in the EU's mandates for SAF uptake, as opposed to a gradual increase over the years, mean growth is likely to flatline ahead of big deadlines, holding back potential growth in the market, Nicole Loschl, advisor for SAF at OMV, told Platts in May.

She is not the only production-side professional to identify problems in EU policy. The EU will likely have to scale back its ambitious sustainable aviation fuel targets, mirroring its recent retreat from a ban on internal combustion engines, as airlines push back on high costs, TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 21.

To mitigate costs, European refineries are increasingly turning to co-processing biofeedstocks with conventional crude to produce SAF.

Co-processing, which is capped by EU rules at 5% biofeedstock in the mix, is viewed as the fastest and most cost-effective ""low capex"" method to produce drop-in SAF without requiring massive modifications to existing refinery infrastructure.

Additional price relief for European markets could come from Chinese SAF imports, as the EU currently has no antidumping duties on Chinese sustainable aviation fuel, potentially creating downward pressure on prices as supply increases.

China's SAF export quota is 1.38 million mt/year, which would be enough to cover all of Europe's expected 1.37 million mt of SAF demand in 2026, according to S&P Global Energy CERA forecasts.

Alternative pathways

Different jurisdictions are encouraging production of alternative pathways to HEFA.

""The finite nature of these feedstocks means that continuing a reliance on one specific feedstock and pathway could lead to sustainability impacts and supply chain disruptions or bottlenecks,"" the UK government said.

It encourages but recognizes the technical and construction risks facing advanced SAF technologies.

The price difference between HEFA-based SAF and synthetic aviation fuel or eSAF is considerable. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency's reference price for SAF in 2024 was Eur2,085/mt ($2,492/mt), compared to Eur7,695/mt for eSAF.

Under the terms of the EU's ReFuel EU Aviation regulation, from the start of last year 2% of aviation fuel supplied in the EU had to be SAF. In 2030, this jumps to 6% and then grows incrementally to 70% SAF in 2050, while eSAF must make up 0.7% of aviation fuel supplied in 2030, rising to 35% in 2050.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-28 15:01:13.887798

As the United Arab Emirates (UAE) progresses production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), it is eyeing major export opportunities to other markets such as the European Union (EU), which is struggling to scale up its own SAF production.

In its national SAF strategy, the UAE has set an annual production target of 700 million liters (185 million gal.) of the fuel by 2030 from as many as five production plants. Some sites are new, while others will be upgrades of existing facilities.

Of the 700 million liters, it has quantified that exporting at least half to “more mature policy regimes” such as the EU could bring in a cumulative $1.7 billion in revenue by 2030.

Multiple projects have been committed or commenced in the UAE.

MENA Biofuels is developing a commercial-scale plant in the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone to convert used cooking oil and other waste-based feedstocks into SAF, initially producing 125 million liters per year, but planning up to 250 million liters.

Late last year, Abu Dhabi-based renewable energy company Masdar and waste management group Tadweer joined forces to annually convert around 500,000 tons of solid municipal waste into SAF by combining gasified garbage and green hydrogen to create syngas, then fuel.

And in January, global investment fund SAFFA, which is focused on accelerating SAF production, announced a $30 million investment in a “Middle East project” by Dubai-based SAF One Energy Management, on which construction will start this year with the aim of commencing SAF production in the 2028 fourth quarter.

The UAE is planning to develop SAF from multiple sources, including recycled fats, oils and greases, municipal solid waste and even oil extracted from saltwater-tolerant plants, or halophytes.

But it is particularly focused on longer-term production of power-to-liquid, or synthetic fuels, created by combining green hydrogen with captured carbon dioxide, then reprocessing this as liquid fuel.

This dovetails with an EU sub-mandate for SAF, which requires synthetic product to be included in blended supplies from 2030, initially comprising a mandated 0.7%, rising to 35% by 2035. It also progresses another key ambition of the UAE to become a major producer of green hydrogen, which is made by combining renewable electricity and water, using locally produced solar energy.

While the UAE is focused on helping other markets to meet their own SAF targets, at home it has a “voluntary target” of 1% SAF, produced locally, to be blended in fuel supplied to its airports by 2031. No usage mandates apply to its own airlines.

This innovation addresses the aviation industry’s significant environmental impact, which currently accounts for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. By utilizing existing landfill-bound waste, the process could generate over 60 billion liters of fuel annually. This dual-purpose solution not only provides a cleaner energy source for long-haul travel but also mitigates methane emissions by diverting organic matter from landfills worldwide.

The aviation sector remains one of the most difficult industries to decarbonize because aircraft require high-energy-density fuels that batteries cannot currently replicate. While previous sustainable aviation fuel initiatives relied on dedicated energy crops, those methods often competed with food production and natural habitats. Using municipal solid waste offers a more sustainable alternative, as cities already possess the infrastructure to collect these materials year-round. Recent data published in Science Direct suggests that integrating waste-based fuels could eliminate the CO2 emission levels associated with approximately one out of every six flights globally.

The transition from trash to fuel involves complex chemical processes. Gasification technology, which turns solid waste into a refineable gas mixture, remains a primary technical hurdle. Ming Zhao, a professor at Tsinghua University, emphasizes that the efficiency of this process is critical to the system’s commercial viability. Additionally, the varied nature of garbage—ranging from food scraps to paper—requires more intensive processing than uniform crop-based fuels. However, the environmental payoff is significant, as it prevents organic waste from decomposing in landfills and releasing potent methane gas.

Progress is also being made specifically regarding food waste. A research team at the University of Illinois utilized hydrothermal liquefaction to transform household scraps into a dense biocrude oil. To solve the problem of inconsistent chemical properties, the researchers identified a specific cobalt-molybdenum catalyst. This allows the biocrude to be refined into a high-performance fuel in a single step, meeting the rigorous safety standards required for jet engines. Notably, this fuel can be used in its pure form without needing to be blended with traditional petroleum-based products.

While promising, experts note that waste-based fuel alone cannot meet the total global demand for aviation energy. Achieving net-zero CO2 emission targets by 2050 will likely require a combination of various sustainable technologies. For waste-based fuel to scale, significant infrastructure investment is needed to move the process from laboratory settings to commercial refineries. If successful, this approach could turn a costly waste management burden into a valuable resource, aligning the future of international air travel with global climate objectives.",https://solarvision.org/wp-content/uploads/transforming-municipal-waste-into-sustainable-aviation-fuel_6979a5e2a61ac.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 12:02:18.493778

Market News Update News Commentary

NEW YORK, Jan. 28, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Biomass-to-jet fuel is becoming one of the most practical ways to cut aviation emissions, and investors are starting to notice. Airlines need cleaner fuel that works with today's planes, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from biomass does exactly that. As demand grows, long-term airline supply agreements, government incentives, and carbon-reduction mandates are helping turn these projects into predictable, revenue-generating businesses rather than experimental climate ideas present opportunity for companies such as: DevvStream Corp. (NASDAQ: DEVS), XCF Global Inc. (NASDAQ: SAFX), Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ: GEVO), GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV) and Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE: BEP).

What makes these projects even more attractive is environmental-asset monetization. In simple terms, biomass-to-jet facilities don't just sell fuel — they also create valuable environmental credits tied to lower emissions and renewable energy use. These credits can be sold for cash or used strategically to improve project economics. For investors, this adds an extra income stream that can boost margins and reduce risk, especially as global demand for carbon and clean-fuel credits continues to rise.

Together, biomass-to-jet development and environmental-asset monetization offer a clear, easy-to-understand investment story. One side sells a cleaner fuel to a massive global aviation market, while the other unlocks added value from environmental credits. The result is a business model with multiple revenue sources, growing policy support, and strong long-term demand — a combination that's increasingly attractive for investors looking for both sustainability and returns.

DevvStream, Southern, and Frontline BioEnergy to Advance Biomass-to-Jet Development and Environmental-Asset Monetization - DevvStream Corp. (NASDAQ: DEVS) ($DEVS) (""DevvStream""), a leading carbon management and environmental-asset monetization firm, today announced that it has signed a binding term sheet (the ""Term Sheet"") with Southern Energy Renewables, Inc. (""Southern"" or ""SER"") and Frontline BioEnergy, a trade name of Frontline Group LLC (""Frontline""), that outlines an expanded collaboration to support the development and de-risking of Southern's planned biomass-to-fuels and chemicals platform in Louisiana.

The collaboration is designed to accelerate technical validation and commercialization by expanding Frontline's existing clean-syngas process demonstration unit at its Nevada, Iowa headquarters with two additional pilot-scale capabilities: a syngas-to-methanol process demonstration unit (""MeOH PDU"") and a methanol-to-hydrocarbons process demonstration unit (""MTH PDU""). These units are intended to support the production of bio-methanol and the conversion of methanol into sustainable aviation fuel (""SAF"") and other hydrocarbon products, generating operational data that Southern expects to apply to engineering, feedstock qualification, and project execution for its proposed Louisiana commercial development pathway, as well as to support the transparency of the $SAF token on Solana.

Under the Term Sheet, Southern expects to provide up to $2.05 million to fund the design, construction, and commissioning of the MeOH PDU and MTH PDU, with Frontline expected to self-perform most engineering, procurement, fabrication, and construction activities. Southern is expected to own the equipment and materials purchased with Southern funds used to construct the PDUs.

Frontline is expected to be affirmed as Southern's exclusive gasification company and, subject to definitive agreements and performance terms, to serve as Southern's exclusive gasification provider for a five-year period for commercial deployment. DevvStream is expected to serve as the exclusive carbon credit and environmental-asset manager for SER's commercial projects. An additional project participant, XCF Global (Nasdaq: SAFX) is anticipated to play a key role in the collaboration, contributing downstream fuels expertise, market and offtake insight, and execution support intended to help translate pilot scale validation into commercial deployment.

This collaboration is also intended to support the broader strategic objectives described in a recently announced binding term sheet regarding a potential three party merger among DevvStream, Southern, and XCF. If the three parties are able to successfully negotiate definitive agreements, DevvStream believes the Frontline pilot scale program can help validate Southern's biomass to methanol and methanol to jet pathways, complement XCF's downstream SAF production capabilities, and further de risk commercialization for the proposed Louisiana development pathway.

""This collaboration is designed to convert innovation into bankable execution,"" said Sunny Trinh, Chief Executive Officer of DevvStream. ""By pairing Frontline's demonstrated gasification and gas-cleanup capabilities with demonstration-scale methanol and methanol-to-jet validation, we believe Southern is building a more disciplined pathway to de-risk engineering, strengthen project economics, and support a credible commercialization timeline. For DevvStream shareholders, our exclusive role in the environmental-asset layer is intended to create an additional, scalable value stream tied to project performance and market demand.""

""This term sheet advances a practical de-risking plan to generate real operating data, validate feedstocks and yields, and move toward definitive commercial agreements with a proven technology partner,"" said Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy Renewables. ""Frontline's platform and experience, combined with a structured validation program and environmental-attribute strategy, is intended to strengthen our execution profile as we advance our proposed Louisiana development pathway.""

The survey shows that 80% of APAC Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) consider environmental concerns when trading with Europe, with sustainability playing a bigger role in logistics decisions. Notably, 37% of Chinese businesses already see sustainability as essential for smoother EU trade. This highlights rising awareness and action on environmental issues among businesses and consumers in the region.

Consumers Pushing Businesses to Incorporate Sustainability into Operations

Consumers are driving demand for sustainable practices, with 84% of APAC consumers pushing businesses to develop eco-friendly online shopping options. Environmental responsibility is becoming a key differentiator, influencing purchasing decisions:

81% of APAC consumers prefer companies that appear to operate more sustainably compared to competitors offering similar products without the same visible operational integrations of sustainability. Similarly, 75% of Chinese consumers find companies with stronger sustainability efforts more appealing than comparable alternatives.

While product integrity and competitive pricing remain key preferences for online shoppers, nearly four in ten APAC consumers are willing to pay premium prices for sustainable packaging. In China, this trend is even more pronounced. Sustainability is no longer just a preference but a mainstream expectation. 40% of Chinese consumers say a company’s ability to operate sustainably influences their purchase decisions, and an impressive 90% are willing to pay more for sustainable packaging when buying gifts.

As environmental awareness grows, businesses are taking note. Sustainable practices are no longer a nice to have, but a must-have for companies to stay competitive in the digital marketplace. Companies are seeing consumers factor in environmental values to their spending decisions, which could directly impact their bottom line.

“To unlock the full potential of cross-border trade, sustainability is a critical factor. It’s not just an expectation —it’s a clear demand from consumers who care about our planet, and it’s shaping the China-EU retail landscape,” said Poh-Yian Koh, president of FedEx China. “These shifts have raised the bar for international logistics companies like FedEx, which is committed to achieving carbon-neutral operations globally by 2040. In China, we are embedding sustainability into every aspect of our operations through initiatives such as vehicle electrification, paperless shipping, and technological innovation, working closely with customers to create solutions that deliver both environmental benefits and business value.”

Reimagining Operations for More Sustainable Logistics

FedEx is stepping up to meet the growing demand for sustainable logistics, investing in cutting-edge technologies and infrastructure that reduce environmental impact while boosting operational efficiency.

One example is FedEx providing customers with the visibility needed to make informed sustainability decisions. FedEx® Sustainability Insights, a cloud-based platform, provides enhanced transparency into environmental impact. Using near-real-time FedEx network data, the tool estimates CO2e emissions for both individual tracking numbers and entire FedEx shipping accounts. Customers can access historical emissions data and search by tracking numbers via their FedEx.com login.

On the aviation side, FedEx recently began using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Chicago O’Hare and Miami International Airports, marking another step in reducing aviation-related emissions within its global air network.In the last mile, FedEx is transforming urban delivery through fleet electrification. Electric vehicles are now deployed across several APAC markets and account for more than 25% of the company’s delivery fleet in China.

Additionally, FedEx continues to integrate digital solutions into its operations in China to replace the printing and submission of large volumes of paper documents. These include FedEx Ship Manager Lite, the FedEx Online Declaration Tool, and FedEx Electronic Trade Documents—innovations that reduce paper and energy consumption while enhancing operational efficiency and visibility.

As cross-border trade continues evolving, the company remains dedicated to delivering faster, smarter, and more sustainable shipping solutions that empower customers to succeed while delivering a more sustainable future.",https://fedex-dims.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/53af57d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4608+0+428/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffedex-static.brightspotgocdn.com%2F6c%2F18%2F7bd1cf9143508051a61960ab9e08%2F20240531-fedex-gz-cx-3701-53830235569-o-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 12:02:26.732508

About Clean Planet Technologies","Clean Planet Technologies (CPTech), part of the Clean Planet Group, has been awarded funding by the UK Department for Transport (DfT) through the UK Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) Clearing House, supporting the next phase of qualification and testing for its waste-plastics-to-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (P2SAF) technology.

The award forms part of a funding package announced today by the DfT, supporting four SAF innovators — Avioxx Ltd, Clean Planet Technologies Ltd, Green Lizard Technologies Ltd, and Zero Petroleum Ltd — to accelerate the testing, certification and commercialisation of next-generation sustainable aviation fuels.

The UK SAF Clearing House plays a central role in the UK’s aviation decarbonisation strategy, providing technical guidance, access to recognised testing facilities, and support for the ASTM qualification process. The programme underpins the UK’s ambition to lead globally in SAF deployment, alongside the SAF Mandate and wider measures to derisk first-of-a-kind SAF production.

Matthew Jee, Director of the UK SAF Clearing House, said:

“The UK SAF Clearing House is delighted to support [Clean Planet Technologies] as they move through the critical stages of fuel qualification. The testing we facilitate provides the robust evidence base that producers and industry needs to build confidence, unlock investment and accelerate the deployment of new fuels. These awards underline the UK SAF Clearing House’s commitment to working closely with innovators to scale sustainable aviation fuel production and to deliver meaningful progress towards a more sustainable aviation sector in the UK.”

Advancing the UK’s first Plastics-to-SAF pathway

For Clean Planet Technologies, the funding will support detailed fuel characterisation, materials compatibility testing, and data generation required for progression through the ASTM qualification process for plastics-derived aviation fuels.

CPTech is developing the SAFe-P2SAF platform — a proprietary system combining pyrolysis and advanced hydroprocessing to convert hard-to-recycle waste plastics into ultra-clean, low-carbon jet fuel. Their technology was unveiled publicly at the SAF Global Summit, where CPTech presented the UK’s first end-to-end Plastics-to-SAF pathway.

The programme builds on CPTech’s patented pyrolysis-oil upgrading technology, now protected in the UK, United States and Saudi Arabia, and is being advanced through the company’s upcoming UK pilot facility, planned for opening in April 2026.

Dr Andrew Odjo, CTO of Clean Planet Energy and CEO of Clean Planet Technologies, said:

“We are delighted to be supported by the UK SAF Clearing House programme, enabling us to accelerate the validation of our innovative plastics-to-SAF technology. Every molecule of virgin fossil fuel that we can replace with our oils brings waste back into the value chain, and significantly reduces lifecycle carbon emissions and plastic pollution. The UK is at the forefront for advanced fuels, and this support helps ground-breaking technologies like ours reach commercial deployment. We’re proud to contribute to the future of sustainable aviation and to the UK’s Net Zero ambitions whilst removing waste from the environment.”

Dr Katerina Garyfalou, COO of Clean Planet Technologies, added:

“This support allows us to move faster and with greater technical confidence through the SAF qualification process. Fuel testing and certification are essential steps in bridging innovation and commercial reality, and the UK SAF Clearing House plays a critical role in reducing risk for new fuel pathways. This award strengthens our roadmap from pilot-scale validation to commercial deployment.”

Supporting UK SAF scale-up and feedstock diversity

With UK and EU SAF mandates coming into force and increasing pressure on traditional bio-based feedstocks, alternative circular feedstocks such as waste plastics are gaining strategic importance. CPTech is an active contributor to the ASTM task force for plastics-to-SAF and is working alongside industry partners, including OMV, whose forthcoming annex is expected to establish the regulatory route for this new class of fuels.

Each stage of the Clearing House programme brings CPTech closer to commissioning its first commercial-scale Plastics-to-SAF unit, targeted later this decade, and to supplying meaningful volumes of low-carbon SAF into the aviation market.

FIGURE 6: INNOVATION POLICY MATRIX As the innovation reaches commercial deployment and socio-political support becomes increasingly important, commercial & management risk remain dominant concerns.","The C2ES Innovation Policy Matrix synthesizes and builds on the latest thinking in innovation policy. It incorporates four interrelated components that, when evaluated together, can help policymakers develop a comprehensive understanding of the policy needs for any given technology and the broader innovation ecosystem. The matrix seeks to introduce sufficient complexity to reflect real-world conditions, while maintaining a user-friendly and intuitive four-by-four model: four key risks, four innovation process stages, four ecosystem functions, and four policy design principles (see Figure1). We introduce these concepts briefly here and then elaborate on each of them in the following sections.

Key Risks: Risk is an intrinsic part of innovation, the nature of which changes over time. The federal government has an important role to play as a risk-tolerant supporter of innovation, particularly when technological feasibility and market applications are still unclear. The matrix considers four common key risks. Each risk arises in at least two of the stages of the innovation process and may be managed by two or more of the innovation ecosystem functions. The four risks are:

science risk

engineering risk

financing risk

commercial & management risk.

Innovation Process: As a technology matures from initial concept to commercial scale, it passes through different stages of the innovation process. Each stage presents distinct risks that must be addressed. The process is often non-linear, with lessons from later stages feeding back into earlier steps. Innovation policies should focus on addressing different risks in each stage and evolve alongside the technology. The four stages of the process are:

research & development

prototyping & demonstration

early adoption

commercial deployment.

Ecosystem Functions: The matrix incorporates four key functions of a healthy innovation ecosystem that operate in every stage of the innovation process, albeit in different ways and to varying degrees. Weak performance in any of these functions can hinder innovation. Effective innovation policy can address these functional gaps—either through direct government action or by stimulating other actors to step in and fill them. The four functions are:

resource push

knowledge management

user pull

socio-political support.

Policy Design Principles: An empirically grounded understanding of the key risks, innovation process, and ecosystem functions provides a solid foundation for policy development. Policymakers should consider the four following principles as they develop a suite of policy solutions:

focus on building ecosystems, not picking winners

shoulder risks where private markets cannot

design and sustain policy to crowd in private capital

align policy duration with technology commercialization timelines.

FIGURE 1: OVERVIEW OF THE C2ES INNOVATION POLICY MATRIX

Component One: Key Risks to Innovation

Innovators are constantly navigating risk, from the earliest stages of research, through to large-scale commercial deployment. The nature of risk also changes over time and evolves alongside the innovation. The goal of federal innovation policy should not be to fully shoulder all the risk inherent in innovation. Rather, the objective should be to provide sufficient policy certainty and risk management to make capital investment attractive for private actors when the opportunity is right. The level and type of risk a company is willing to assume depends on its own risk tolerance, business model, and how effectively federal policy mitigates key uncertainties. For example, an institutional investor may be more comfortable taking on financing or commercial and management risks if public policy has already reduced the initial science and engineering risks. The federal government is often better positioned to absorb those initial risks because it operates on longer time horizons and with broader societal objectives than private actors, who typically face shorter payback expectations and fiduciary obligations to shareholders.

The task of policymakers is to support and enable a vibrant innovation ecosystem in which private sector risk-taking is maximized through the public sector appropriately taking on risks the private sector cannot. Additionally, the goal is not for every technology to succeed, but to create an environment in which the best technologies do. This, of course, is easier said than done.

The key risks that must be managed within an innovation ecosystem include:

Science risk refers to the possibility that a technology may prove to be scientifically or physically infeasible.

Engineering risk is the risk that a technology that works under ideal conditions (e.g., in the lab) cannot be reproduced cost-effectively at scale or under real-world conditions.

Financing risk is the challenge an innovative company faces in accessing capital or managing debt effectively.

Commercial and management risk involves the possibility that the innovation will not generate sufficient market demand, fail to be competitive with alternatives, confront supply chain limitations, or otherwise fall short of profitability for a critical mass of market participants.

For the sake of simplicity, this matrix limits its focus on risk to the four listed above and embeds them into the two next sections below.

Component Two: The Innovation Process

Innovations typically proceed through a series of stages as sketched out in Figure2. The process can be very rapid, as is common in the software and internet industries, or it may take many years or even decades, as has typically been the case in capital-intensive heavy industries, like energy, infrastructure, and transportation. This latter type of industry is the focus of our technology working groups, which are all hard-tech innovations that require large-scale development, engineering, and construction.

It is important to note that scaling innovation is often a non-linear process. The learning generated at each stage of the innovation process, represented by the arrows in Figure2, can provide valuable guidance for the others. These different learning cycles—denoted at the bottom of the figure as ‘learning by researching,’ ‘learning by doing,’ and ‘learning by using’—illustrate how knowledge gained in one phase can inform others. For example, the prototyping & demonstration stage may reveal technical challenges that R&D must address before an innovation can advance further. Similarly, as production scales to meet the needs of early adopters, supply chain constraints may reveal that alternative inputs will be needed for successful commercial deployment. Even during commercial deployment, late adopters may uncover new applications that were not anticipated in earlier stages, requiring prototypes to be revisited. These feedback loops create a virtuous cycle of learning that can help drive down costs, create economies of scale, and clarify the long-term revenue drivers and use cases for the innovation.

FIGURE 2: STAGES OF THE INNOVATION PROCESS

Research & Development

The R&D stage of the innovation process involves identifying problems and brainstorming solutions to address them. This stage focuses on conducting scientific, technical, or market research with the goal of developing prototypes to be tested in the next stage of the innovation process, prototyping and demonstration. During the R&D stage, scientists and inventors—whether working in corporate, government, or university laboratories, or independently in the proverbial garage—play a core role. These actors generate new ideas and explore their potential value in practice. While private sector support for R&D is needed, government funding is critical, as it drives progress in areas that may not yield immediate profits for companies but are vital to society, such as national security, public health, and clean energy. Innovation policies supporting this stage of the innovation process include federal funding for R&D projects and testbeds at national laboratories and universities.

Prototyping & Demonstration

Next comes the prototyping and demonstration phase of the innovation process, where ideas developed during R&D are transformed into tangible products, models, or systems for testing. In this phase, prototypes are developed, tested, and refined by entrepreneurs, investors, and builders to evaluate their performance and feasibility. Demonstrations provide proof-of-concept, showing how the innovation works in practice and whether it can meet real-world needs. An example of an innovation policy that supports this stage of the innovation process is cost-shared demonstration projects between the federal government and the private sector. Such policies are designed to bridge the “missing middle”—the gap between early R&D, where public funding predominates, and the later stages of the innovation process, where private capital typically steps in.

Early Adoption

The third stage of the innovation process is early adoption, where proven technologies begin to move beyond controlled prototypes and demonstrations into initial markets. In this stage, early adopters—often niche industries, specialized users, or governments—begin deploying first-of-a-kind commercial-scale projects. While end users play an important role throughout the innovation process, their feedback and support are especially influential in shaping the direction and pace of innovation during this phase. Innovation policies that support early adoption include tax credits, grants, and federal procurement programs, which help reduce costs and build market confidence.

Commercial Deployment

Commercial deployment is the final stage of the innovation process, where technologies move from early adoption into widespread use across mainstream markets. As innovations progress from first-of-a-kind deployment to nth-of-a-kind deployment, they may begin to achieve economies of scale. During this stage, manufacturers and technology users play central roles, addressing remaining challenges in production and application. Their efforts focus on achieving key performance and financial milestones needed for scaling, while also strengthening supply chains and developing new markets. Many policies that support early adoption by creating demand, such as procurement programs and tax credits, also help advance the last stage of the innovation process. Broader demand-side policies, such as carbon pricing and other market-based approaches like clean energy standards, can also support deployment. Actions that provide regulatory certainty, such as streamlined permitting processes, can play a crucial role as well.

Mapping Risks onto the Innovation Process

Each stage of the innovation process carries a distinct risk profile, and well-designed innovation policies can help mitigate these risks (see Figure3). For example, science risk is most prevalent during the R&D and prototyping & demonstration stages, where new ideas and technologies must be proven viable. Engineering risk becomes especially prominent during prototyping & demonstration and continues into early adoption, as technologies are tested, refined, and scaled. Financing risk arises throughout the innovation process but may be particularly severe in the prototyping & demonstration and early adoption stages, where the “missing middle” funding gap occurs. Commercial and management risk is most significant in the early adoption and commercial deployment stages, when innovations must compete in the marketplace, secure supply chains, and demonstrate long-term value.

It is important to note that these risks may also be present outside of the specific stages identified, given the interrelated nature of the innovation process. However, this categorization can serve as a productive initial filter for policymakers as they seek to address the risks impacting technologies at different stages.

FIGURE 3: KEY RISKS ACROSS THE INNOVATION PROCESS

Component Three: Functions of Innovation Ecosystems

The innovation process does not occur in a vacuum and is shaped by broader dynamics and actors in the innovation ecosystem. Federal policy and regulation do not act alone; private markets, information flows, and social norms all inform an innovation’s path toward commercial deployment. Private markets provide financial incentives and encourage competition between firms and individuals participating in the innovation process. Information flows drive the exchange of data and ideas between actors and processes. Social norms can impact adoption by positively or negatively sanctioning users of a given innovation.

It is critical for policymakers to understand these dynamics because they provide valuable information on the behaviors of ecosystem actors and the nature of potential barriers to innovation. Succinctly capturing so much complexity is challenging, but the International Energy Agency effectively characterized these using their “Four Pillars of Effective Energy Innovation Systems.” Each of these pillars represents a distinct function of the innovation ecosystem. When barriers obstruct one or more of the four functions, the innovation process begins to slow or stall. These four functions—resource push, knowledge management, user pull, and socio-political support—are the third component of the C2ES Innovation Policy Matrix (see Figure4).

FIGURE 4: INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS

Resource Push

Resource push is focused on ensuring the sustained provision of resources, education, and skills to support developers along the innovation process. Actors involved in the innovation process need money, equipment, talent, and other resources to do their work. Relatedly, those with resources seek opportunities to advance innovation by supporting technology developers. Private, public, and philanthropic investors who perform the resource push function have different motivations and place different weights on the risks being addressed. For example, public and philanthropic funders may support R&D projects that contribute to public welfare and are happy to absorb science risk, while the limited financial rewards from taking such risks often deter private investors. Public and philanthropic funders may also want to support prototyping and demonstration to reduce engineering and financing risks for later-stage private investors.

Like federal funding for R&D, tax incentives for private R&D spending and public-private demonstration partnerships are innovation policies that allow risks to be shared among types of investors who have different tolerance levels for different risks, but whose combined investments enable R&D and demonstration projects to happen.

Knowledge Management

Knowledge management impacts all the learning feedback loops (i.e., learning by researching, doing, and using) and ensures that new knowledge flows to other users and new products. This function is impacted by norms and laws related to secrecy, disclosure, and property rights, which may incentivize or disincentivize actors to share or withhold knowledge. Some first movers are concerned with carrying out engineering and commercial activities that are costly to them while benefiting fast followers who can learn from the first movers’ successes and failures. This is also known as knowledge spillover. Adjustments to intellectual property or trade secrecy law may remove this barrier.

In other cases, advances that would benefit an entire industry are blocked by antitrust laws that restrict competitors from sharing knowledge. Exceptions to these laws for innovative joint ventures among competitors can enable progress.

User Pull

User pull stimulates both innovators and users to accurately understand the costs, benefits, use cases, and risks of adoption. These factors are often determined by markets, which aggregate individual decisions to inform producers about the scale and type of demand for the innovation. Novel innovations that must compete with legacy incumbents are particularly vulnerable to weak user pull, especially when potential users are cost sensitive and risk averse.

Innovation policies that support this function include tax incentives for customers to help kickstart market demand, government procurement to help shoulder the higher initial costs of new technologies, and regulatory mandates that level the playing field for all users.

Socio-political Support

Socio-political support impacts every stage of the innovation process and every other function of the innovation ecosystem. Such support—or disapproval—may be expressed in the media, public policy, and day-to-day social interactions with knock-on effects on the availability of resources, knowledge flows, and adoption decisions. The socio-political support function tends to come to the fore in later stages of the innovation process, as a much larger portion of the population becomes aware of and may be impacted by the innovation.

Public engagement that provides broad education about the benefits, costs, and risks of the innovation, and allows members of the public to have a voice in the deployment process, may address this challenge. Community benefits plans and public infrastructure funding that shift the balance of benefits, costs, and risks may also deepen socio-political support for an innovation.

Mapping the Risks onto the Ecosystem Functions

These four functions serve as a helpful lens when trying to understand the nature of a given risk from different perspectives in the ecosystem (see Figure 5). When looking at the resource push function, policymakers can consider how to advance the needs of innovators who are doing the hard work of testing and building new technologies (scientific and engineering risk) and trying to secure investors and customers (financing and commercial & management risk). When looking through the lens of knowledge management, policymakers can consider how to accelerate the different feedback loops across the innovation process to drive down all four types of risk. In the user pull function, policymakers take the view of the demand-side actor, and what prospective investors (financing risk) and customers (commercial & management risk) need to feel a technology is sufficiently derisked (engineering risk) so that they can make their own investments. Lastly, the socio-political support lens ensures that policymakers are not just considering policy through the priorities of supply- and demand-side actors, but also through the impact they will have on communities, workforces, and the public as they are financed and deployed (financing and commercial & management risk).

FIGURE 5: KEY RISKS ACROSS ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS

Component Four: Key Principles of Innovation Policy

The following section lays out the final component of the matrix: four key principles of innovation policy, drawing on insights from C2ES’s technology working groups. These are intended to guide federal innovation policy broadly—not only for the technologies featured in our working groups, but for any emerging solution facing similar commercialization barriers. These do not map onto specific functions or stages; rather, they serve as key best practices.

Focus on Building Ecosystems, Not Picking Winners

The role of federal policymakers is not to pick a specific winning company or technology, but rather to foster a robust, and ultimately self-sustaining, innovation ecosystem. Effective policy should unlock both creativity and competition, enabling the best-performing technologies to emerge over time. As developers vie to be selected for limited federal dollars and programs, frontrunners will emerge.

Working group insights

The continuous challenge for policymakers is to strike the right balance between supporting emerging dominant designs while avoiding full technological lock-in. For instance, LDES technologies encompass a diverse range of durations (e.g., inter-day and multi-day) and forms (e.g., electrochemical, mechanical, chemical, and thermal). For this reason, C2ES developed a policy recommendation for the LDES working group on LDES procurement targets. One implementation design option is the establishment of distinct verticals across a range of durations and forms to enable maximum flexibility for utilities, developers, and other power system stakeholders. This policy design enables innovation to progress while avoiding lock-in. This approach also ensures that where there are limited public resources, actors in the ecosystem are competing on comparable performance metrics.

Shoulder Risks Where Private Markets Cannot

The federal government should shoulder appropriate risks—including by removing barriers to innovation—that the private sector cannot manage on its own. This need spans the entire innovation process, from exploratory R&D, through to the incentivization of private investment in commercial projects.

Working group insights

First-of-a-kind projects are often the riskiest and the most difficult to finance—a recurring theme in all four of our technology working groups—as startups work to build their demonstration projects. While venture capitalists have high risk appetites, the capital intensity of these projects often exceeds their threshold, and their payback periods tend to be much shorter than the time required to develop, permit, and construct a large-scale demonstration project. Project finance from institutional investors is typically used to fund these capital-intensive projects, but these lenders have much lower risk appetites. Before they are willing to provide financing, these financiers typically need projects to prove their “bankability.” They do so when a project has sufficiently reduced its commercial, technological, and financial risk to give investors reasonable confidence that it will be profitable.

This threshold is extremely difficult for many early-stage innovations to meet before they build their initial demonstration projects, particularly since much of the derisking and cost efficiencies occur during the ‘learning by doing’ stage of prototyping/demonstration. Federal cost-sharing and grants fill a critical gap here in providing the necessary support for innovations to prove out their technologies via initial demonstration projects. This reality is central to our policy recommendations for the SAF and clean hydrogen working groups, which call for the federal government to provide additional support for demonstration and early commercial-scale projects.

Enact Durable Policies to Crowd in Private Capital

Effective innovation policy should have a multiplier effect on private capital. Over time, private sector funding into technologies must meaningfully exceed the amount invested by the federal government. This serves as an important barometer for both the efficacy of the policy and whether the innovation can succeed without perpetual federal support. Inherent in this is the assumption that the policy environment remains sufficiently stable so that financiers and customers have the certainty they need to make longer-term investments and multi-year purchases. Policy stability also enhances policy impact by aligning expectations of all participants in the innovation process.

Working group insights

As noted in the previous principle, securing financing from institutional investors for emerging technologies is a significant barrier on the path to full-scale market diffusion. The same is true for customers. In our working groups, the “green premium,” or the additional cost of adopting nascent clean technologies compared to incumbent technologies, was identified as a significant barrier to scaling demand. Innovation policy can play a role here by offsetting some of the cost for early customers, so that technologies can move down the cost-curve and become more affordable for later customers. Federal tax credits, for example, can reduce or eliminate the green premium by providing a discount on eligible products or lowering the tax burden for customers. Some tax credits also allow transferability, which enables technology developers to sell their credits to third-party buyers for cash. These incentives allow innovators to build revenue streams from nascent technologies and create a customer pipeline, particularly during the early adoption stages of the innovation process.

This was the case in the ECR working group, where both demand- and supply-side players agreed that the 45Q tax credit for carbon sequestration was a major catalyst for the private sector investment in carbon removal technologies. This tax credit helps bridge the gap in the early stages of deployment by reducing costs and attracting investment. As the technology matures and unit costs decline, private investors will be able to carry more of the burden, and the tax credit should phase out. However, at the time of publishing the C2ES ECR policy recommendations (September 2024), higher-than-anticipated inflation had significantly eroded the value of the carbon sequestration tax credit to 87 percent of its initial value. Although the tax credit will be adjusted for inflation in 2027, its value continues to diminish in today’s inflationary environment. This weakens the efficacy and impact of the tax credit for both carbon removal companies and their potential customers. In essence, although the existence of the credit itself is durable (available for twelve years after a project is placed in service), its value is not, since it is not currently indexed to inflation. As a result, one of our key policy recommendations for the working group was to strengthen the credit by incorporating an inflation adjustment in 2024 rather than in 2027.

Align Policy Duration with Technology Commercialization Timelines

Innovation policies should be aligned with real-world commercialization and maturation timelines. Even the most well-designed policy will not be effective if it expires before it can be used by the very innovators it is intended to support. The role of policymakers is to ensure that policies are aligned with the actual needs and pace of the innovation ecosystem.

Working group insights

Innovation takes time, especially in hard-tech sectors. For example, participants in the SAF working group noted existing production tax credits would expire before a new SAF facility could be constructed and start production. Working group members estimated that it takes between five and seven years to fully develop an advanced SAF production facility, while at the time, the 40B sustainable aviation fuel and 45Z clean fuel production tax credits only credited fuels sold within a combined five-year window of eligibility. This finding informed our policy recommendation to establish a production tax credit which allows the taxpayer to commence a fixed duration of eligibility at the time a facility is placed into service, thereby ensuring policy support is consistent with the timeline of SAF project development. Since the publication of our SAF policy recommendations in December 2024, the 40B sustainable aviation fuel tax credit has expired. However, in July 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act extended the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit through to December 31, 2029. 4, 2025). Safe harbor provisions—which enable developers to register their intentions with the Internal Revenue Service and begin construction within a specified time frame to qualify for the credit, even if the facility is placed in service after the expiration of the credit—are another approach that can add flexibility and ensure that policies are aligned with development timelines.

Ideally, as an innovation matures, the ecosystem will become increasingly self-sustaining, with the private sector driving innovation and market development, and outdated policies being phased down over time. This frees up federal funds to support the next generation of technology and ensures that innovation policy continues to advance new technologies as opposed to supporting a new set of incumbents.

Synthesizing the Components: The Innovation Policy Matrix

Figure6 brings together these various components in a single matrix. This matrix is intended to capture the relationship between the different components of the innovation matrix, while also producing a heatmap of where policy need will likely be the greatest. The four stages of the innovation process are placed consecutively along the bottom row of the matrix and the four functions in the leftmost column. The common parameters between the technology-focused innovation process and ecosystem-focused functions are the key risks. These are marked as a diagonal trendline to broadly capture how the nature of risk changes over time, with the caveat that there may be cases where a particular risk appears outside of this general trendline. Similarly, while the ecosystem functions are important across all stages of the innovation process, the matrix highlights periods of heightened risk that can be most effectively mitigated by pairing policies supporting specific ecosystem functions with those addressing particular stages of the innovation process. The policy principles do not formally map onto this matrix, but rather serve as best practices when designing policy interventions to address the key issues identified in the matrix.

As shown in Figure6, science risk is strongest in the lower left quadrant, where R&D and resource push intersect. Policies in this quadrant will be principally concerned with providing funding and resources to scientists and innovators who are conducting lab-scale research and experiments on novel ideas.

The greatest concentration of risks is found within the middle two quadrants where knowledge management intersects with prototyping and demonstration and user pull intersects with early adoption. Given the confluence of risks, it is no surprise that between these two quadrants lies the “valley of death” for innovators. As innovators work to transition between prototyping and demonstration to early adoption (e.g., first- or second-of-a-kind projects), they are simultaneously grappling with science, engineering, financing, and commercial & management risks. Policy interventions for the second quadrant from the left could include federal cost-shares to help offset high upfront costs, as well as incentivizing strategic partnerships and knowledge sharing between private actors to help accelerate bench-scale prototypes into larger-scale demonstrations. Policy interventions for the third quadrant from the left could include additional cost-sharing, federal procurement, and tax credits to help kickstart market demand for early adoption.

FIGURE 6: INNOVATION POLICY MATRIX

As the innovation reaches commercial deployment and socio-political support becomes increasingly important, commercial & management risk remain dominant concerns.

However, where NQVs are sold in excess of the Strike Price, the producer must still pay any Strike Price excess to the counterparty.","Back in October 2025, the UK Government consulted on how to fund its proposed revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) supporting production in the UK of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) (see our previous article). The government has now taken the next step in readying the RCM for take-off by launching a new consultation on its “minded to” positions on the proposed terms of the contracts for difference (which can be found here) which will deliver the RCM support to SAF producers and the rules that will apply for the first allocation round of the RCM contracts (known as SAF AR1).

This article focuses on the indicative Heads of Terms (HoTs) provided with the consultation. We will shortly be publishing Part 2, looking at the proposed approach for SAF AR1.

Proposed Contract Terms

As confirmed in January 2025, the government has elected to deliver the RCM using a Guaranteed Strike Price mechanism and a contract for difference. This approach (and many of the proposed contract terms) will be familiar to those with knowledge of the low carbon electricity contracts for difference (CfDs), the low carbon hydrogen agreement and the industrial carbon capture revenue support scheme.

Under this approach, the SAF producer and a government-backed counterparty will enter into a private law contract which sets a price (Strike Price) that the SAF producer is guaranteed to receive for its qualifying volumes of SAF. A reference price (typically representing the market price of the SAF) will determine whether a payment is due from, or to, the relevant SAF producer. Where the reference price exceeds the Strike Price, the producer pays the difference to the counterparty but, where it is below the Strike Price, the producer is paid the difference by the counterparty.

The HoTs provided as part of the consultation detail some of the proposed terms for the RCM contracts to be included as part of (at least) SAF AR1. Below, we have set 5 of the key areas to be aware of:

Term

It is proposed that the RCM support is provided for a maximum of 15 years, in line with other UK low carbon business models that also use a CfD approach to provide revenue certainty.

The SAF producer will be required to satisfy certain conditions precedent (including achieving project milestones) before the commencement of the RCM support period and within a “Target Commissioning Window” (TCW) . If the producer is late in delivering the project, the period of revenue support will start to erode.

The HoTs include a Longstop Date (following the end of the TCW) for satisfying the operational conditions precedent which, if not achieved, may result in termination of RCM contract. This device is intended to allow (government's) committed funding to be redeployed rather than being tied up in projects with no realistic prospect of being commissioned. Extensions of time to the TCW and the Longstop Date are permitted for events of force majeure and certain delays to utilities and CO2 network connections.

The below figure (taken from the consultation) is helpful is illustrating the various periods and deadlines:

2. Calculating the reference price

The reference price is the benchmark against which the strike price is compared. This would usually represent the market price for the relevant product but as there is not currently a market price for non-HEFA SAF (i.e. SAF made from sources other than animal fats and cooking oils) there is currently no established market price. So, the government has proposed use of an alternative proxy for the RCM while the market matures.

The consultation document sets out three alternative potential options for this proxy reference price:

the higher of the achieved sales price and the price payable for conventional Jet A-1 fuel;

the higher of an achieved sales price and the price payable for HEFA SAF; or

Jet A-1 Fuel Price plus UK SAF Mandate certificate Price (per certificate earned)

The government has not provided a “minded to” position on which of these options to adopt and is seeking stakeholder views. It is worth noting that:

The Government has indicated that the achieved sales price would include both the value of the SAF as jet fuel, and the value of the SAF Mandate certificates that the fuel would be eligible for;

views are being sought on whether, if Option (1) is chosen, a premium should be added to the Jet A-1 fuel price to reflect the monetisation of carbon savings available to airlines using SAF due to the existence of compliance and voluntary carbon/offset markets (e.g., UK Emissions Trading Scheme, CORSIA, etc.); and

views are being sought on whether it is possible for the reference price to transition from the proxy to a reliable market price (once this is determined for the SAF market) during the term of the RCM contracts.

3. Price Adjustments

The consultation also sets out several proposed incentives and price adjustments for the Strike Price. It states that:

the Strike Price is expected to be adjusted using CPI (in line with other similar low carbon business models) to safeguard against margin erosion as operational costs increase during the contract term

the government is minded to adjust the Strike Price depending on the carbon intensity (and therefore the savings) the SAF achieves as, if the RCM guarantees a fixed Strike Price irrespective of the saving, producers will not be incentivised to produce SAF with a carbon intensity that will deliver the UK SAF Mandate as efficiently as possible, undermining the policy intent

A number of options are being considered as an incentive to encourage producers to seek the best possible price for their SAF, and to support the emergence of a non-HEFA SAF market price. These “Price Discovery Mechanisms” include:

Offering producers a financial incentive via a revenue bonus from the counterparty where their SAF has been sold at a higher price than a ‘floor price’.

Providing producers with a guaranteed strike price for a proportion of their volumes (‘supported volumes’) and therefore expose any ‘unsupported volumes’ to market pressures, therefore incentivising producers to seek the highest possible pricing for non-HEFA SAF

dictating how certain volumes are sold (e.g. either by a public exchange or a producer auction), and

Imposing conditions for producers to sell their SAF on “reasonable, commercial arm’s-length terms.

SAF sales: caps, floors and restrictions

The HoTs propose a number of caps, floors and restrictions on SAF volumes sold:

the “Contract Sales Cap” – the maximum qualifying volumes of SAF which can be sold during the term of the RCM contract (i.e. 15 years) which will be eligible for the Strike Price payment. Once this limit is reached, there will be no further payments in relation to any SAF produced

the “Annual Sales Cap” – the maximum qualifying volumes of SAF which can be sold during a single year. This seeks to cap the annual liability under the RCM contract but is not intended to be 1/15th of the Contract Sales Cap and will allow an additional percentage of sales in any given year beyond that pro-rata amount to give producers some flexibility to account for operational variability and market fluctuations

the “Annual Sales Floor” – the minimum qualifying volume of SAF that must be sold in a year. If this is not met then the volumes of SAF sold by the facility will be deemed to be equal to the Annual Sales Floor, meaning that the amount of SAF eligible for difference payments over the lifetime of the contract is reduced. However, DfT is also considering other consequences for failing to meet this floor, including the use of shortfall payments

”Qualifying Offtakers” and “Non-Qualifying Volumes (NQVs)” – the difference payment will only be payable to the SAF producer on volumes of SAF produced by the SAF facility, which meet the sustainability criteria and are sold to a “Qualifying Offtaker”. The HoTs envisage several classes of non-qualifying offtakers including a class aimed at preventing SAF producers receiving difference payments in respect of SAF which is exported outside of the UK. However, where NQVs are sold in excess of the Strike Price, the producer must still pay any Strike Price excess to the counterparty.

Sustainability Criteria

The HoTs propose that RCM contracts will be underpinned by the same sustainability criteria as the UK SAF Mandate. However, as the SAF Mandate is a regulatory instrument that could be subject to amendment over time there is a need to consider how to manage any misalignment which appears in the event that the sustainability criteria in the mandate are updated.

The consultation is therefore seeking views on whether the sustainability criteria in the RCM contract should remain the same throughout the term of the RCM contract (i.e. the SAF mandate criteria would “grandfathered”), be updated in line with the SAF mandate or, even, whether there should be any criteria at all.

Next steps

At this stage, the HoTs remain indicative and, whilst it sets out a number of “minded to” positions, the consultation seeks responses from stakeholders to inform the final decisions. The consultation closes on 3 April 2026 and the government anticipates that the required legislation to implement the RCM will be laid by the end of 2026, including any associated regulations.

Direct Route

The direct route aims to convert CO2 and H2 straight into light olefins (C2-C4) using a bifunctional catalyst that combines methanol synthesis and methanol-to-olefins functions in a single step. This approach potentially offers greater efficiency by eliminating intermediate steps, but currently faces challenges with selectivity and byproduct formation, particularly CO and various hydrocarbons outside the desired range.

The goal is to specifically target the jet fuel carbon chain range (C8-C16) without the need for downstream upgrading, unlike traditional Fischer-Tropsch processes that produce a broader range from C2 up to C40 or C50.

Indirect Route

The indirect route first converts CO2 and H2 to methanol (CH3OH), then to dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3), before final conversion to light olefins. While requiring more process steps, this route achieves higher selectivity towards desired products. TNO's SIENNA reactor technology enhances this route in-situ removing water vapor during the reaction, pushing CO2 conversion beyond limitations dictated by thermodynamics (e.g. from 20% to 37% per pass).",https://www.tno.nl/publish/pages/13855/renewable_fuels-tno-index-met-grid.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 12:02:49.998050

It will also see the launch of an eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project before the year end, to mobilise at least €500m for synthetic aviation fuel projects.","Reaching net zero by 2050 is a big ask. It requires airlines to make unparalleled capital investment in transitioning away from fossil fuels – one estimate goes as high as €2.4 trillion – while at the same time demand for air travel continues to grow.

The bottom line is that airlines will not achieve their ambitious target alone. They need financial institutions to step up and for governments to offer subsidies, to incentivise cleaner fuels and technology, and disincentivise the continued use of fossil fuels through stronger carbon pricing.

Tim Johnson, Director of the Aviation Environmental Federation, sums up the current situation when he says: “Beyond the short-term focus on scaling SAF (sustainable aviation fuel), there’s insufficient long-term investment in bringing cleaner technologies to market and outright opposition to carbon pricing mechanisms that would help incentivise the industry to decarbonise.”

The UK Jet Zero strategy will only halve the industry’s peak emissions in 2019 by the target year of 2050 through in-sector measures. Similarly, SAF targets globally are only aiming for 5%–10% by 2030.

While SAF has been hailed as the saviour for the industry, its success has been marred by high cost and lack of availability. Clean alternatives, such as electric aircraft and hydrogen, will not be ready to scale by 2050.

“Net zero 2050 has never been about getting the sector to fully decarbonise by this time. Most roadmaps forecast significant residual CO2 emissions”

Alexandre de Joybert, Director of Sustainability at ACI EUROPE, highlights the need for a collective effort if 2050 is to be a realistic and achievable target for net zero aviation in Europe. It hangs on decisive action being significantly scaled up across both industry and policy stakeholders.

“Close collaboration among policymakers, investors, energy producers, airlines and airports is essential to secure long-term funding, expand renewable energy and SAF infrastructure, and accelerate the deployment of emerging technologies,” he says.

Today, SAF makes up about 0.2% of aviation fuel and scaling production requires not only hundreds of billions of investment but also reliable feedstocks. Corporate purchasing has been one way to help scale production, but again, it’s not enough.

Collective strength

There are pockets of positive change and optimism. For example, attempting to galvanise the industry is Destination 2050, an alliance bringing together Europe’s airlines, airports, aerospace manufacturers and air navigation service providers with ACI EUROPE as one of its founding partners. This body is committed to achieving climate-neutral European aviation in line with EU climate goals and the Paris Agreement.

“The alliance has outlined a clear roadmap showing that the pathway to climate neutrality remains within reach,” says de Joybert. “A combination of four key measures will be essential to achieving substantial CO2 emissions reductions: advances in aircraft and engine technology, improvements in air traffic management and operations, large-scale adoption of sustainable aviation fuels, and economic measures, like EU ETS and CORSIA.” [CORSIA is ICAOs offsetting scheme]

There is no one silver bullet to increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. Instead there are multiple levers. “The key point here is that while we should rightly champion any innovations that are advancing and could have a significant impact, we need multiple innovations to help decarbonise the sector,” says Lahiru Ranasinghe, Director of Sustainability at easyJet.

Quick fixes

Leaving SAF aside for the moment, the other three drivers can be actioned without delay. Contrail [condensation vapour trail] prevention is one such, which makes up non-CO2 emissions. A study led by Google Research and Breakthrough Energy, together with support from American Airlines, found that by using AI-based predictions to make small modifications to routes that were projected to create contrails, their formation could be reduced by 54%, although avoidance burned 2% additional fuel.

Other recent studies have shown that only a small percentage of flights need to be adjusted to avoid the majority of contrail warming. There were encouraging results from a small group of American pilots who flew 70 test flights over six months, according to Jill Blickstein, Vice President Sustainability at American Airlines.

“There is no one silver bullet to increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. Instead there are multiple levers”

“While there are more questions to answer about how to operationalise contrails avoidance, we’re excited to have played a role in establishing their first proof point,” she said at the time. “And we’re looking forward to sharing what we learned with stakeholders in the aviation industry and beyond.”

Virgin Atlantic runs a Contrail Impact Task Force, sharing research and turning it into actionable changes.

Advances in aircraft and engine technology is farther advanced, with fleet renewal a major plank of most airlines’ environmental strategy.

easyJet points to modern aircraft, such as Airbus NEO models, being up to 13% more efficient and 50% quieter. Both easyJet and Virgin have invested in these new aircraft.

Software upgrades like Descent Profile Optimisation have helped easyJet reduce carbon emissions by 800,000 tonnes within its own operation. And it has made huge strides in developing carbon removal and hydrogen-powered engine technology through partnerships with 1PointFive and Rolls-Royce.

Etihad, meanwhile, took delivery in July of the first of 20 A321LR, an aircraft that achieves at least 20% lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions compared with previous generation single-aisle aircraft.

To meet its 2050 goal, United Airlines expects to take delivery of over 600 new narrow body and widebody aircraft by the end of 2033, with an expected 20% improved fuel efficiency per seat compared to older types. This fleet renewal plan will help the airline reach 21% of its forecasted emissions reductions by 2050.

Virgin Atlantic is transforming its fleet with 74% next generation aircraft, improving carbon efficiency by 20% over the last decade. It is aiming to achieve 15% gross reduction in carbon emissions per revenue tonne kilometre.

Not enough

This year the fuel airlines use to fly to EU airports, including the UK and Switzerland, must be at least 2% SAF but it’s three to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel and it will take years to develop the infrastructure to meet required production volumes. It means that airlines will not be able to adopt SAF at the scale needed to meet net-zero and decarbonisation targets.

“There is so much noise around the many different types of feedstocks, buying mechanisms, accounting guidelines that it’s difficult for stakeholders to get their head around SAF,” explains Delphine Millot, Senior Vice President Advocacy and Sustainability and MD GBTA Foundation.

Countries such as the Netherlands and the UK are at the forefront of significant investments in SAF infrastructure, with production capacity ramping up in APAC region countries, specifically China and Singapore. The UK has a £63 million funding boost for new SAF projects. The EU reckons some €100bn is needed by 2035 to drive SAF production.

“There is so much noise around the many different types of feedstocks, buying mechanisms, accounting guidelines that it’s difficult for stakeholders to get their head around SAF”

Ranasinghe at easyJet points to Exolum’s launch of the UK’s first independent SAF blending facility, expansion of SAF availability at major European airports by Signature Aviation, and the EU’s “ReFuelEU” initiative reporting record SAF use ahead of the 2025 2% blending mandate. “But we need to see much more,” he says.

November’s European Commission announcement, under the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), was welcome news. It attempts to remove key investment barriers and bridge the financial gap in the short-term, mobilising close to €3bn of funds available until the end of 2027. It will also see the launch of an eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project before the year end, to mobilise at least €500m for synthetic aviation fuel projects.

Travel managers can do their bit too, by purchasing more SAF (which helps their Scope 3 targets), report annually on social and environmental risks under the new CSRD legislation (currently those non-EU companies with a turnover in excess of €450m but from 2030 it will include SMEs), and drive behavioural change to multi-modal journeys.

Changing minds

The GBTA has come to the rescue with a toolbox to help behavioural change.

“The toolbox indicates how travel policies can be optimised to encourage multi-modal journeys or even a shift from air to rail when such alternatives are available,” says Millot.

Today, meeting the 2050 zero emissions target looks unlikely but AEF’s Tim Johnson says: “Net zero 2050 has never been about getting the sector to fully decarbonise by this time. Most roadmaps forecast significant residual CO2 emissions that will need to be balanced with greenhouse gas removals, like direct air capture.”

Interim targets would stop the industry’s delay tactics in the hope that solutions would be found in the future.

Governments need to step up, as outlined, while more joined-up thinking between other government departments and agencies such as energy and industrial policies would help too, say the experts.

“Talking to energy and climate departments outside of transport ministries will be key to effective planning,” says Johnson.

There’s still a long way to go and airlines cannot absorb the green premium alone.",https://thebusinesstravelmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bigstock-Plane-2391217-e1769602396901.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 07:57:14.732366

Showcases Phunware’s Introduction of Two Hospitality Specific Products, One for Luxury Brands and the Other for Full-Service Property Owners

AUSTIN, Texas, Jan. 28, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Phunware, Inc. (“Phunware” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: PHUN), the enterprise cloud platform for mobile-first software products, solutions, data, and services to enable customers to engage, manage, and monetize their global audiences, today introduced a redesigned corporate website and a refined portfolio of products for enhancing hospitality guest-related experiences, engagements and revenues.

Phunware’s redesigned corporate website reflects the evolution of its pioneering capabilities and forward-thinking approach to mobile software products and solutions with a focus on the large and growing hospitality market. The dynamic, user-friendly, and content-rich website showcases a refined product portfolio and highlights how Phunware's advanced location and wayfinding capabilities continue to remove friction, enhance guest experiences and interactions across hospitality touchpoints to build relationships and loyalty, and free up hospitality staff to deliver other higher-touch guest services.

The website notably showcases Phunware’s introduction of two hospitality specific products, one for luxury brands and the other for full-service property owners, which provide solutions for developing modular, native mobile apps, with cloud-driven updates, and range of solutions for enhancing on-property guest experiences and engagements, and ancillary guest revenue growth. These solutions address critical needs for large spatially complex hotels and resorts that offer a variety of on-site amenities and events.

“When I stepped in as CEO, my mandate was simple: focus and double down on where we deliver the most value. We looked at the data, and it was clear that our platform can and should be used to fundamentally change the economics of large hotels and resorts,” said Jeremy Krol, Interim CEO of Phunware.

The Luxury Engagement product tier, developed for premium luxury hospitality brands, delivers fully-personalized digital guest experiences and engagements and takes advantage of Phunware’s deep wayfinding capabilities to provide guests with a branded, immersive companion throughout each guest’s on-property journey. It was developed to anticipate needs, enhance discovery, reinforce a brand’s premium identity at every touchpoint, and increase guest relationships and revenues. The Enriched Experience product tier, developed for full service hospitality properties, delivers options to elevate guest engagement across meaningful touchpoints, drive discovery, and expand and reinforce guest revenue opportunities, all of which builds on core services for deeper interactivity, more curated ways to explore the property, and more intelligent and dynamic guest engagement with services, amenities and events.

“We’re building software solutions designed to eliminate friction.” Krol added. “When a guest doesn't have to wander through a maze with a paper map to find his or her room or come back tomorrow to book a spa appointment because the spa just closed, the guest’s vacation starts instantly. At properties running Phunware hospitality software, we are seeing guest app adoption rates exceed 70%. That level of guest engagement is, in our view, unprecedented in hospitality. It can turn a static hotel or resort stay into a high-margin digital marketplace. For our customers, we believe this means massive jumps in ancillary revenue. For our investors, we believe it demonstrates the unlocking of a repeatable, highly scalable customer playbook in a multi-billion-dollar market. We have the ability to deploy this standard to customers across the hospitality industry, and our new website reflects an absolute commitment to addressing the biggest problem in hospitality: unnecessary friction between guests and their vacations.”

The Nasdaq-listed company said the funding round includes participation from a group of institutional investors, including new strategic backer SiteGround. The latest raise follows a separate $40 million investment secured in May 2025, providing LanzaTech with expanded capital to support project development and near-term growth priorities.

Chief executive Jennifer Holmgren said the new funding positions the company to advance high-impact commercial opportunities with the potential to reshape low-carbon manufacturing and fuel production. According to LanzaTech, the combined financing supports continued scale-up of its waste gas conversion platform and deployment of first-of-a-kind industrial projects.

Momentum Builds Across Fuels and CCUS Projects

Over the past year, LanzaTech has made significant progress across its project pipeline. In 2025, the company secured a €40 million (~$48 million) award from the EU Innovation Fund, pending final agreement, alongside £6.4 million (~$8.8 million) from the UK’s Advanced Fuels Fund to support carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) initiatives and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development.

A major milestone was also achieved through LanzaJet, in which LanzaTech holds a non-controlling majority stake. The commissioning of the world’s first commercial-scale ethanol-to-jet fuel facility marked a key step in scaling SAF production and commercializing alcohol-to-jet pathways.

LanzaTech’s core technology converts industrial waste gases, including emissions from steel production, into ethanol and other valuable chemicals.

Relevant: LanzaJet Taps Fluor For New UK Sustainable Aviation Fuel Hub

The company currently operates commercial-scale facilities in Asia and Europe, exporting its platform to heavy industry partners seeking to reduce emissions while creating new revenue streams from waste carbon.

Looking ahead, LanzaTech is advancing a hub-and-spoke production strategy designed to aggregate ethanol from multiple distributed sources and supply centralized alcohol-to-jet facilities. The model is intended to improve manufacturing flexibility, increase fuel output, and support large-scale deployment of low-carbon fuels.

As governments and corporations continue to prioritize industrial decarbonization and SAF supply growth, LanzaTech’s latest capital raise signals continued investor confidence in carbon recycling as a commercially viable pathway for emissions reduction.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LanzaTech-Process-Thumbnail-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 07:57:20.138648

Once operational, DRAGON II is expected to deliver around 80,000 tonnes of SAF, about 1% of UK jet fuel requirements, and 8,000 tonnes of renewable diesel annually, supporting around 300 skilled jobs during its construction and 150 in operation. Saltend Chemicals Park is owned by px Group, part of the Ara Partners portfolio of companies specialising in industrial decarbonisation investments. px Group offers world-class infrastructure, utilities, deep-water jetty access, and fully managed site services platform, and was selected after an exhaustive assessment of sites across the UK.

Development of the DRAGON projects has been aided by strong UK government support. In July 2025, LanzaTech was awarded a £6.4 million grant from the Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), which is helping to accelerate both DRAGON I and DRAGON II projects. Project DRAGON—which stands for Decarbonizing and Reimagining Aviation for the Goal Of Netzero - features two complementary initiatives that both use the LanzaJet® Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process: DRAGON I in Port Talbot, South Wales; and DRAGON II, in Humberside. LanzaTech also plans to produce in total 50kt of the ethanol to be processed at these facilities from sites in Milford Haven and Saltend using LanzaTech’s gas fermentation technology. This will convert waste carbon dioxide and green hydrogen into ethanol that will then leverage LanzaJet’s technology to convert that ethanol to produce a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) SAF. The use of green hydrogen is dependent upon amendments to current rules for SAF production due to the high cost of the hydrogen required.

The planned facility is scheduled to begin construction in the second half of 2027 and be operational during 2030. It represents a significant contribution to the UK’s net-zero ambitions, national energy security, and the creation of high-value jobs and industrial growth across the region. LanzaTech is exploring opportunities to collaborate with local partners and utilise the region’s extensive supply chains and emerging CO2 pipeline infrastructure and hydrogen production to maximise benefits to the region to reinforce Humberside’s position as a leader in industrial decarbonisation. This opportunity aligns with Saltend Chemical Park’s vision and strategic drive to support the transition, diversification, and decarbonisation, including the development of a low-carbon hydrogen industry, whilst maximising economic value, industrial synergies, and long-term sustainability.

Mr Jim Woodger, LanzaTech Managing Director for EMEA and Americas, said, “We are excited to bring LanzaTech’s carbon recycling technology paired with our partner LanzaJet’s world-leading SAF production technology to Humberside. We anticipate we will create around 300 high quality, skilled jobs both during construction and in operation.” He added, “We selected the px Saltend Chemicals Park because it offers exceptional infrastructure for SAF production and the future prospect for hydrogen and CO2 pipelines and storage. The skills of the px Group team also provides an excellent fit with LanzaTech.”

Geoff Holmes, CEO of px Group, added:

“This major investment from LanzaTech demonstrates Saltend’s continued attractiveness for world-first, low-carbon projects. Our plug-and-play model, deep technical expertise, and unmatched site infrastructure allow pioneers like LanzaTech to deploy innovative projects at speed and scale. DRAGON II will further strengthen the Humber’s status as the UK’s Energy Estuary, delivering jobs and a resilient, net-zero future for the region.”

By Anushree Mukherjee and Enes Tunagur

BENGALURU/LONDON Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. demand for imported fuel oil is set to fall this year as refiners snap up new flows of heavy Venezuelan crude, ​yielding more domestically produced fuel oil that can be processed into higher-value products such as gasoline and ‌diesel.

The ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in early January is expected to shift global oil flows as more supply from the South ‌American country enters the market. This is creating new opportunities for complex U.S. refiners, particularly on the Gulf Coast, which have plants configured to run heavier crude slates and equipped with secondary units to upgrade the fuel oil they produce.

Some of the additional 50 million Venezuelan barrels are set to enter global trade after U.S. President Donald Trump ⁠took control of the South American country's ‌oil.

Refiners Valero and Phillips 66 have already bought cargoes of Venezuelan crude, Reuters reported last week, as part of Washington's agreement with Caracas to export the 50 million barrels.

""If ‍more Venezuelan heavy barrels land on the USGC, you'll likely see less need to import high-sulfur fuel oil and blendstocks as refinery feed, because refiners can generate that residual product internally from crude instead of buying it in, so it's generally bearish for ​imported fuel oil demand into the Gulf,"" Gregory Battenfield, crude and refined products broker at International Trans ‌Oil Energy, said.

Refining analysts at Energy Aspects said in a recent report that U.S. Gulf Coast refiners could absorb an additional 600,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan crude, bringing the total to 700,000 bpd and allowing for a full redirection of current exports.

RIPPLE EFFECT ON EUROPEAN FUEL OIL MARKETS

Located on Jurong Island, the proposed plant will convert low-carbon ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel, with a planned production capacity of up to 100,000 tonnes of the fuel a year, according to a Jan 28 joint statement by Keppel and Aster.

Keppel and Aster will conduct front-end engineering design studies to evaluate the technical configuration, project capital expenditure, as well as the potential financing and offtake structures required, before they reach a final investment decision regarding the proposed facility.

An earlier feasibility study to validate the technical and commercial viability of the facility’s sustainable aviation fuel production has already been completed, Keppel and Aster noted.

The news comes amid a deal spree by Aster, a joint venture between Indonesia’s Chandra Asri and commodities trader Glencore, which has scooped up energy-related assets of oil majors such as ExxonMobil and Shell over the past year or so.

Through coordination with the Economic Development Board and Enterprise Singapore, the proposed plant aligns with Singapore’s goal of becoming a sustainable aviation fuel hub in Asia, said Keppel and Aster.

The plant will be one of Asia’s first purpose-built ethanol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel facilities.

It will also support the Republic’s national sustainable aviation fuel target, efforts to decarbonise its aviation ecosystem, as well as the growing needs of regional airlines, the companies said, without naming specific carriers.

They noted that the use of ethanol-to-jet fuel will enable the plant to draw on a range of bioethanol feedstocks while retaining flexibility to adapt as regional bioethanol markets evolve.

Ms Cindy Lim, chief executive of Keppel’s infrastructure division, said: “Sustainable aviation fuel is one of the most practical and impactful levers available today to decarbonise air travel, and demand from airlines and passengers is growing rapidly.

“This project aims to deliver a bankable, scalable end-to-end solution to produce sustainable aviation fuel close to where airlines need it.”

It will do this by combining Aster’s refining and chemical expertise with Keppel’s capabilities in developing, integrating and operating complex energy and environmental assets, she added.

Locating the proposed plant on Jurong Island also allows the project to leverage existing industrial infrastructure and logistics, while creating new opportunities for sustainable fuels in the region, said Keppel and Aster.

The developments are not expected to have any material impact on the net tangible assets per share or earnings per share of Keppel for the current financial year.

In April 2025, Aster

took over Shell’s Singapore refining and refinery assets on Pulau Bukom and Jurong Island

. In October 2025, it inked a reportedly

US$1 billion deal to buy ExxonMobil’s Esso-branded petrol kiosks chain.

The energy and chemicals player has set aside US$2 billion for Singapore investments and is on the hunt for further deals, with several more in the pipeline, The Business Times reported previously.

These estimates reflect third-party analyst views rather than Capital.com’s own analysis and may change as new information emerges.

MarketBeat (consensus view)

MarketBeat reports that six analysts covering Gevo have an average 12-month price target of about $6.42 per share, with individual targets ranging from low single digits to the low teens. The report pairs this with a 'Moderate Buy' consensus rating, while noting ongoing losses alongside revenue growth and a market capitalisation below $0.5bn (MarketBeat, 20 January 2026).

Investing.com (consensus estimates)

Investing.com shows that the average 12-month price target from four analysts stands around $5.31 per share, with forecast lows of $2 and highs of $14. The site notes that these projections imply material variance relative to then-prevailing prices, amid volatility linked to project milestones and funding conditions (Investing.com, 22 January 2026).

Predictions and third-party forecasts are inherently uncertain, as they cannot fully account for unexpected market developments. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.

GEVO stock price: Technical overview

The GEVO stock price is trading near $2.02 as of 11:43am (UTC) on 22 January 2026, holding just above the 10-day simple moving average around $2.01 while remaining below the 20-, 50- and 100-day SMAs clustered near $2.04, $2.09 and $2.09 respectively, and above the 200-day SMA near $1.70. The 200-day EMA sits higher, around $1.84, reinforcing a longer-term base below spot, while the Hull moving average near $1.99 tracks short-term fluctuations close to price. The 14-day RSI at roughly 45.8 sits in neutral territory, and the ADX near 12.6 suggests a weak trend environment rather than a strong directional phase.

On the topside, the nearest classic resistance sits around $2.31 (R1), with a sustained daily close above that level potentially bringing the $2.62 (R2) area into view. The classic pivot near $2.13 marks initial support on pullbacks, followed by the 200-day SMA around $1.70 as a longer-term reference level. Meanwhile, S1 near $1.82 defines a lower zone that could come into focus if the pivot area gives way on a closing basis (TradingView, 22 January 2026).

SKOKIE, Ill., Jan. 28, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LanzaTech Global, Inc (NASDAQ: LNZA) (“LanzaTech”), has announced Saltend Chemicals Park in Humberside as the intended location for its pioneering DRAGON II project—a £600 million investment to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel at scale. Once operational, DRAGON II is expected to deliver around 80,000 tonnes of SAF, about 1% of UK jet fuel requirements, and 8,000 tonnes of renewable diesel annually, supporting around 300 skilled jobs during its construction and 150 in operation. Saltend Chemicals Park is owned by px Group, part of the Ara Partners portfolio of companies specialising in industrial decarbonisation investments. px Group offers world-class infrastructure, utilities, deep-water jetty access, and fully managed site services platform, and was selected after an exhaustive assessment of sites across the UK.

Development of the DRAGON projects has been aided by strong UK government support. In July 2025, LanzaTech was awarded a £6.4 million grant from the Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), which is helping to accelerate both DRAGON I and DRAGON II projects. Project DRAGON—which stands for Decarbonizing and Reimagining Aviation for the Goal Of Netzero - features two complementary initiatives that both use the LanzaJet® Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process: DRAGON I in Port Talbot, South Wales; and DRAGON II, in Humberside. LanzaTech also plans to produce in total 50kt of the ethanol to be processed at these facilities from sites in Milford Haven and Saltend using LanzaTech’s gas fermentation technology. This will convert waste carbon dioxide and green hydrogen into ethanol that will then leverage LanzaJet’s technology to convert that ethanol to produce a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) SAF. The use of green hydrogen is dependent upon amendments to current rules for SAF production due to the high cost of the hydrogen required.

The planned facility is scheduled to begin construction in the second half of 2027 and be operational during 2030. It represents a significant contribution to the UK’s net-zero ambitions, national energy security, and the creation of high-value jobs and industrial growth across the region. LanzaTech is exploring opportunities to collaborate with local partners and utilise the region’s extensive supply chains and emerging CO2 pipeline infrastructure and hydrogen production to maximise benefits to the region to reinforce Humberside’s position as a leader in industrial decarbonisation. This opportunity aligns with Saltend Chemical Park’s vision and strategic drive to support the transition, diversification, and decarbonisation, including the development of a low-carbon hydrogen industry, whilst maximising economic value, industrial synergies, and long-term sustainability.

Mr Jim Woodger, LanzaTech Managing Director for EMEA and Americas, said, “We are excited to bring LanzaTech’s carbon recycling technology paired with our partner LanzaJet’s world-leading SAF production technology to Humberside. We anticipate we will create around 300 high quality, skilled jobs both during construction and in operation.” He added, “We selected the px Saltend Chemicals Park because it offers exceptional infrastructure for SAF production and the future prospect for hydrogen and CO2 pipelines and storage. The skills of the px Group team also provides an excellent fit with LanzaTech.”

Geoff Holmes, CEO of px Group, added:

“This major investment from LanzaTech demonstrates Saltend’s continued attractiveness for world-first, low-carbon projects. Our plug-and-play model, deep technical expertise, and unmatched site infrastructure allow pioneers like LanzaTech to deploy innovative projects at speed and scale. DRAGON II will further strengthen the Humber’s status as the UK’s Energy Estuary, delivering jobs and a resilient, net-zero future for the region.”

About LanzaTech

LanzaTech (NASDAQ: LNZA) is a leader in carbon management, using its proprietary gas-fermentation platform to transform waste carbon into valuable products. Through global partnerships, LanzaTech enables the production of feedstocks for high-value markets including SAF and chemicals.

Once operational, DRAGON II is expected to deliver around 80,000 tonnes of SAF, about 1% of UK jet fuel requirements, and 8,000 tonnes of renewable diesel annually, supporting around 300 skilled jobs during its construction and 150 in operation. Saltend Chemicals Park is owned by px Group, part of the Ara Partners portfolio of companies specialising in industrial decarbonisation investments. px Group offers world-class infrastructure, utilities, deep-water jetty access, and fully managed site services platform, and was selected after an exhaustive assessment of sites across the UK.

Development of the DRAGON projects has been aided by strong UK government support. In July 2025, LanzaTech was awarded a £6.4 million grant from the Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), which is helping to accelerate both DRAGON I and DRAGON II projects. Project DRAGON—which stands for Decarbonizing and Reimagining Aviation for the Goal Of Netzero - features two complementary initiatives that both use the LanzaJet® Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process: DRAGON I in Port Talbot, South Wales; and DRAGON II, in Humberside. LanzaTech also plans to produce in total 50kt of the ethanol to be processed at these facilities from sites in Milford Haven and Saltend using LanzaTech’s gas fermentation technology. This will convert waste carbon dioxide and green hydrogen into ethanol that will then leverage LanzaJet’s technology to convert that ethanol to produce a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) SAF. The use of green hydrogen is dependent upon amendments to current rules for SAF production due to the high cost of the hydrogen required.

The planned facility is scheduled to begin construction in the second half of 2027 and be operational during 2030. It represents a significant contribution to the UK’s net-zero ambitions, national energy security, and the creation of high-value jobs and industrial growth across the region. LanzaTech is exploring opportunities to collaborate with local partners and utilise the region’s extensive supply chains and emerging CO2 pipeline infrastructure and hydrogen production to maximise benefits to the region to reinforce Humberside’s position as a leader in industrial decarbonisation. This opportunity aligns with Saltend Chemical Park’s vision and strategic drive to support the transition, diversification, and decarbonisation, including the development of a low-carbon hydrogen industry, whilst maximising economic value, industrial synergies, and long-term sustainability.

Mr Jim Woodger, LanzaTech Managing Director for EMEA and Americas, said, “We are excited to bring LanzaTech’s carbon recycling technology paired with our partner LanzaJet’s world-leading SAF production technology to Humberside. We anticipate we will create around 300 high quality, skilled jobs both during construction and in operation.” He added, “We selected the px Saltend Chemicals Park because it offers exceptional infrastructure for SAF production and the future prospect for hydrogen and CO2 pipelines and storage. The skills of the px Group team also provides an excellent fit with LanzaTech.”

Geoff Holmes, CEO of px Group, added:

“This major investment from LanzaTech demonstrates Saltend’s continued attractiveness for world-first, low-carbon projects. Our plug-and-play model, deep technical expertise, and unmatched site infrastructure allow pioneers like LanzaTech to deploy innovative projects at speed and scale. DRAGON II will further strengthen the Humber’s status as the UK’s Energy Estuary, delivering jobs and a resilient, net-zero future for the region.”

“Asian governments are now making regulatory commitments to SAF,” Mifsud, who oversees the firm’s sales and trading in renewable fuels for the EMEA and APAC regions, told Fortune.
Last July, national carrier Bangkok Air began using a 1% SAF blend last July, cutting about 128 kilograms of carbon emissions per flight.
SAF has been one way that the carbon-intensive aviation industry—responsible for 2.5% of global emissions—has tried to go green.
A lack of feedstock is also holding back SAF production.","Built by Finnish fuel producer Neste in 2010, the facility underwent a $1.9 billion expansion in 2019. Reopened in 2023, it now produces up to a million tonnes of SAF annually. Most of Singapore’s sustainable jet fuel is exported to Australia and Europe, but Neste executive Mario Mifsud says Asia is the “next big frontier” for SAF.

“Asian governments are now making regulatory commitments to SAF,” Mifsud, who oversees the firm’s sales and trading in renewable fuels for the EMEA and APAC regions, told Fortune. “We’ve seen this in Europe—one or two countries start, and other countries will follow.”

In November, Singapore mandated that, by 2026, SAF make up 1% of all jet fuel used at its Changi and Seletar airports, with further plans to raise the quota to 5% by 2030, in line with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)’s goal to have net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.

“The 1% target doesn’t seem like a massive goal, but it will start the ball rolling,” Mifsud explains. “Neighboring countries will look and follow.”

Thailand also plans to reveal national SAF standards this year. Last July, national carrier Bangkok Air began using a 1% SAF blend last July, cutting about 128 kilograms of carbon emissions per flight. (On average, flying from London to New York generates about 493 kilograms of carbon per passenger, according to German nonprofit Atmosfair.)

Last May, South Korea became one of the first countries in Asia to mandate SAF on international flights, with the ruling slated to kick in by 2027. The country aims to scale up the proportion of SAF to between 7% and 10% by 2035.

Globally, Europe leads in SAF adoption, with the region’s 2025 ReFuelEU policy mandating a 2% SAF blend. (The EU has a 70% SAF mandate which will kick in by 2050.)

SAF has been one way that the carbon-intensive aviation industry—responsible for 2.5% of global emissions—has tried to go green. Now, with governments getting serious about pushing airlines to use sustainable fuel, the industry may finally be starting to get off the ground.

Ramping up production

Demand for SAF in Southeast Asia is projected to grow from 15,000 barrels per day in 2030 to over 700,000 barrels a day by 2025, according to the ASEAN SAF 2050 Outlook report. Production is likely to surge too, with ASEAN projecting daily production as high as 8.5 million barrels of SAF per day.

On Jan. 26, Hong Kong-based energy firm EcoCeres opened Malaysia’s first commercial-scale SAF production facility in the city of Johor Bahru, just across the border from Singapore. It can produce up to 420,000 metric tonnes of SAF each year.

During the launch of EcoCeres’ Tanjung Langsat plant, Noraini binti Ahmad, Malaysia’s minister of plantation and commodities, said Malaysia would soon have its own SAF targets.

“Under the National Energy Transition Roadmap, an initial SAF blending target of 1% is important to create demand and support market growth,” Noriaini said. “This plan reflects our strategy to position Malaysia’s commodity sector as a responsible player in the global energy transition, and by using certified waste-based biomass, we are adding value to our resources, strengthening supply chains and supporting higher value downstream activities.”

The Johor plant is EcoCeres’ second, following its factory in China’s Jiangsu province, which generates 350,000 metric tonnes of SAF per year.

Matti Lievonen, the CEO of EcoCeres, said the Malaysia plant marks the firm’s first step to expanding internationally. “This place in Johor is excellent, because you have feedstock from Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries, a really good seaway to pop out deliveries and a strong workforce in Malaysia.”

Scaling up

Aviation accounts for roughly 2.5% of global carbon emissions, yet ways to decarbonize the sector are still in the stage of development and are unfeasible for long-haul flights.

Electric aviation, for example, may work for only very short trips, as it’s constrained by the energy storage capacity of batteries. (Jet fuel holds 30 times more energy per kg than the most advanced lithium-ion battery.)

A lack of feedstock is also holding back SAF production. The International Energy Agency is urging industry players to explore alternative feedstock sources apart from used cooking oil and animal fats.

“Renewable fuels are very much at the start-up phase,” Mifsud of Neste says. “When you’re in oil and gas, you drill a well and get your oil out—it’s very simple. But when you’re in renewable fuels, the collection of waste materials brings significant complexity.”","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Neste_Refinery_030_rgb_full-2.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-28 03:57:51.984979

But no one was playing from the same score.

The first World Economic Forum without Klaus Schwab at the helm did not merely lack its conductor. It revealed an orchestra that has forgotten why it ever assembled in the first place.

A forum built for dialogue has drifted into a staging ground for dominance. This year in Davos felt less like a meeting and more like a mirror, reflecting the very dysfunction it was created to repair.

The WEF is easy to mock: the queues of black limos, the status-coded badges, the sense of a rarefied elite debating the state of the world from a mountain resort. Yet for half a century it has served a more practical role: as a stress-test for coordination among the political and economic elites who shape global markets, institutions and rules of the game.

When alignment among governments, major corporations and financial power centres is strong, it tends to surface here. When it weakens, Davos becomes one of the first places where the breakdown is visible.

This year, the fractures were so pervasive that Davos felt like a hall of broken glass, each shard reflecting a different power, priority and reality.

The significance lay not in any single speech or walkout, but in what the splintering itself exposed lying beneath the surface drama.

The pattern playing out in Davos is the same pattern stalling climate action, hollowing out multilateral agreements and leaving the Sustainable Development Goals dangerously adrift.

It is not a failure of knowledge. We know what needs to be done. It is not a failure of resources. Global capital has never been more abundant.

It is a failure of collaboration and collective action. A failure of governments to align around shared interests rather than narrow advantage; of businesses to act as system-shapers rather than short-term competitors; and of leaders across sectors to share risk, and act in service of a common good.

In his much-praised speech, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney named it directly: the rules-based international order has ruptured. Middle powers can no longer rely on the protection of stable institutions. His conclusion was not resignation but redirection. If the old architecture cannot hold, those outside its centre must build new coalitions capable of acting without permission from above. This is more than geopolitics. It is the logic of every major transition in history.

We carry a comforting myth that there are people in charge who know what they are doing, who understand the system and who hold the power to fix it.

It’s a story we learn early in childhood: when problems become overwhelming, someone in authority will step in and solve them.

But we are not children. And watching leaders at Davos only reinforces what we learn when we become parents ourselves: those in charge are often far less in control than they may appear. The better lesson lies not in childhood instinct, but in history.

The abolition of slavery did not begin with empires. Universal suffrage did not originate with kings. Civil rights did not start in palaces. Systemic change happens when coalitions form in the middle and make the old order economically, socially and politically untenable.

Those in middle positions, whether nations, businesses or citizens, consistently underestimate their collective power. Alone, each feels constrained. Together, they constitute a force no single actor can match. This is the multiplier effect of collaboration, the only lever capable of moving systems when concentrated power has stalled.

Progress comes not from pleading with the powerful, but from making new coalitions so effective that resistance becomes irrelevant.

And this is why the most important story of Davos 2026 was not in the Congress Centre, but on the margins – in side rooms, informal gatherings and unlikely partnerships.

That’s where we saw coalitions forming around regenerative agriculture and nature restoration; serious conversations about redirecting the $2.6 trillion in subsidies that destroy ecosystems; investors working with policymakers to bring nature onto balance sheets; countries and companies aligning on clean infrastructure, food system reform and long-term resilience.

Davos has not lost its relevance. Bringing the world’s political and economic leaders together still matters. But credibility is no longer built by a small group at the top.

So, the question facing the World Economic Forum is simple: can it reclaim the cooperation that has migrated to its periphery and bring it back to the centre where it belongs?

About Ethanol-to-Jet (EtJ)

The EtJ pathway involves converting bioethanol into SAF through a series of established chemical processes such as dehydration, oligomerisation, hydrogenation and fractionation. This approach presents a promising solution for reducing carbon emissions in the aviation sector. By using feedstocks from biomass or waste materials, the proposed facility will produce SAF that complies with CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) standards.

A holistic climate approach NEATS represents a major move toward a more formalised and coherent approach to addressing aviation’s full climate impact.","The European Commission and EUROCONTROL have released an updated version of their digital system designed to assess aviation’s non-CO2 climate effects

Known as NEATS, the Non-CO2 Aviation Effects Tracking System, the new Version 2 marks a significant step toward more comprehensive climate accounting in the aviation sector.

While aviation emissions have traditionally focused on carbon dioxide, scientific evidence increasingly shows that non-CO2 effects such as contrails and nitrogen oxides (NOx) play a major role in aviation’s overall climate impact. NEATS aims to bring these effects into a structured monitoring and reporting framework.

What NEATS Version 2 delivers

NEATS V2 allows aircraft operators to calculate the non-CO₂ climate impact of individual flights using operational data they already collect. At this stage, the results are indicative and reflect the evolving nature of climate science and modelling techniques. However, the tool provides valuable insights into how specific flights contribute to warming beyond CO2 emissions alone.

The system integrates a range of scientifically established models that assess per-flight climate effects. A core component of NEATS is the PyContrails Python library, which is widely used to model contrail formation and persistence. Contrails are among the most significant non-CO₂ contributors to aviation’s climate footprint, particularly at high altitudes.

Preparing for EU ETS reporting

The release of NEATS V2 is closely tied to upcoming regulatory requirements. Further refinements to models, functions, and data parameters are already underway in preparation for Version 3. NEATS V3 is expected to play a huge role in supporting the EU Emissions Trading System reporting for 2025 emissions.

Unlike the current version, V3 will introduce dedicated user interfaces tailored for aircraft operators, independent verifiers, and competent authorities. This will make the monitoring, reporting, and verification process quicker and more accessible across the aviation sector.

Collaboration across Europe

NEATS has been developed under a cooperation agreement between EUROCONTROL and the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Climate Action.

Its development demonstrates collaborative efforts with airlines, aircraft and engine manufacturers, and technical partners.

Key contributors include To70 and AerLabs, as well as Germany’s national weather service (DWD) and aerospace research centre (DLR). In addition, the system has been developed in collaboration with Swiss authorities, ensuring that NEATS also covers flights reported under the Swiss Emissions Trading System. This alignment strengthens cross-border consistency in climate reporting.

A holistic climate approach

NEATS represents a major move toward a more formalised and coherent approach to addressing aviation’s full climate impact. By automating and standardising the monitoring of non-CO₂ effects, the tool helps bridge the gap between scientific research and regulatory implementation.

The system supports the broader goals of the EU ETS by expanding climate accountability beyond carbon dioxide alone. It also reinforces the European Union’s position as a global leader in climate policy and digital innovation, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors like aviation.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iStock-1776557168-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 23:57:15.823661

Under the agreement, Keppel and Aster will conduct front-end engineering design studies to evaluate the technical configuration, project capital expenditure, as well as potential financing and offtake structures required to reach a final investment decision for the proposed facility.

An earlier feasibility study has already been completed to validate the technical and commercial viability of the facility’s sustainable aviation fuel production, Keppel and Aster said.

As one of Asia’s first purpose-built ethanol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel facilities, it will support both Singapore’s national sustainable aviation fuel target and the growing needs of regional airlines, said the companies.

They noted that the use of ethanol-to-jet fuel will enable the plant to draw on a range of bioethanol feedstocks while retaining flexibility to adapt as regional bioethanol markets evolve.

Cindy Lim, CEO of Keppel’s infrastructure division, said: “Sustainable aviation fuel is one of the most practical and impactful levers available today to decarbonise air travel, and demand from airlines and passengers is growing rapidly.

“This project aims to deliver a bankable, scalable end‑to‑end solution to produce sustainable aviation fuel close to where airlines need it.”

It will do this by combining Aster’s refining and chemical expertise with Keppel’s capabilities in developing, integrating and operating complex energy and environmental assets, she said.

Locating the proposed plant on Jurong Island also allows it to leverage existing industrial infrastructure and logistics, while creating new opportunities for sustainable fuels in the region, said Keppel and Aster.

The partners on Tuesday revealed they began ground testing a hybrid engine demonstrator that is designed to burn 10 percent less fuel compared to best-in-class engines for single-aisle, narrowbody aircraft. NASA and GE had previously tested individual components and systems, but December marked the first time they brought everything together and put the modified GE Passport engine on a mount.

“We’re getting close to the payoff on work that’d been in progress for a long time,” said Anthony Nerone, manager of NASA’s Hybrid Thermally Efficient Core (HyTEC) project during the demonstrator’s development, in a news release.

HyTEC aims to leverage NASA’s resources to mature the hybrid engine technology, which the space agency believes could appear on commercial aircraft as soon as the 2030s. As part of the effort, it developed a compact engine core that is designed to improve fuel efficiency while providing the same thrust as single-aisle aircraft engines.

The high-bypass commercial turbofan engine is powered by GE’s electric motor and generators, with the assistance from electric power allowing it to use less jet fuel. It is designed to work with or without batteries or other energy storage systems.

Per NASA, the engine “extract[s] energy from some of its operations and insert[s] that supplementary power into other parts.” Similarly, some commercial hybrid-electric concepts—such as Electra’s EL9 or VoltAero’s Cassio—rely on electric power for takeoff and landing but use a gas turbine to recharge their batteries during the less demanding cruise phase.

“Turbines already exist. Compressors already exist,” said Nerone. “But there is no hybrid-electric engine flying today. And that’s what we were able to see.”

NASA and GE conducted the test at the latter’s Peebles Test Operation site in Cincinnati. GE said it demonstrated power injection, extraction, and transfer and exceeded performance benchmarks that NASA developed with private sector input. The space agency described the test as “successful” and estimated it to be one of the most complex demonstrations GE has ever undertaken.

“They had to integrate equipment they’ve never needed for previous tests like this,” said Laura Evans, acting HyTEC project manager.

NASA said the partners will analyze test data and work toward a compact engine test later this decade. In 2024, it predicted that would happen by 2028.

“This will be the first mild hybrid-electric engine and could lead to the first production engine for narrowbody airliners that’s hybrid electric,” Nerone said at the time.

NASA earlier this month also completed high-speed taxi testing of a scale model test article for a wing that is designed to reduce drag through laminar flow—another efficiency-minded technology. The space agency is studying an array of future aviation technologies—from hybrid-electric propulsion to uncrewed traffic management (UTM) systems—alongside other government and commercial partners.

GE’s Hybrid Ambitions

GE has produced conventional engines since the early 20th century. But in the future, it will look to sell megawatt-class, hybrid-electric power systems for military and commercial single-aisle aircraft, offering improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. The company in 2021 committed to achieve carbon neutral operations by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050.

The company said December’s test supports its efforts under RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines)—a technology demonstrator project it coleads with Safran Aircraft Engines through Safran’s CFM International venture. More than 2,000 engineers are working on the program, which aims to achieve fuel savings of 20 percent.

Unveiled in 2021, the RISE demonstrator has completed more than 350 tests of open fan engine systems, hybrid-electric propulsion, and technology for compact engine cores—like the HyTEC demonstrator’s, but also compatible with hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). GE said it is performing aircraft and engine integration and will target ground and flight testing this decade.

Much of the company’s electric and hybrid testing takes place at the University of Dayton in Ohio, where it has poured nearly $100 million into a 138,000-square-foot research and development hub. It also has several demonstrators that are designed to test the integration of electrical power systems with turboshaft, turboprop, and turbofan gas engines.

Beyond HyTEC, GE is working with NASA, Boeing, and other partners such as BAE Systems toward ground and flight tests of a hybrid-electric powertrain by 2030. A $197 million NASA contract will support installation of GE’s CT7-9B turboprop on a Saab 340B testbed, modified by Boeing with a nacelle, flight deck software, and other integrations. NASA aims to introduce the technology to commercial aviation fleets by 2035.

The U.S. Army is exploring GE’s hybrid engines through its Applied Research Collaborative Systematic Turboshaft Electrification Project (ARC-STEP), which conducted an initial demonstration in late 2024. GE under a $5.1 million contract will research, develop, and test a megawatt-class, electrified powerplant to gauge how it would perform on military rotorcraft.

The CT7 turboshaft and GE’s electric motor and generator will also be integrated on Sikorsky’s Hybrid-Electric eXperimental (HEX) demonstrator—planned as a precursor to a scaled-up commercial model.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/2025-geaerospace-pex-3b-peebles-9173a.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 21:56:46.068851

In Indonesia, the government and several airlines are also preparing to adopt bioavtur through the use of used cooking oil. To what extent will this plan be realized globally and nationally?

The International Civil Aviation Association (IATA) estimates on its official website that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could contribute around 65 percent to the emissions reductions needed by aviation. The industry is targeting net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050. To achieve this target, massive clean energy production is needed to meet the aviation industry's demand.

SAF is a liquid fuel made from plants or animals rather than fossil fuels. This type of fuel has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent compared to traditional jet fuel, as cited by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

SAF is classified as sustainable because the raw materials do not deplete food supplies or water resources. This fuel also reduces forest degradation. Meanwhile, fossil fuels increase CO2 levels by emitting carbon.

According to analysis by The Guardian, a single long-duration flight can produce more carbon emissions in a few hours than the average emissions of one person in 56 different countries over a year.

The excessive emissions from aviation have led many parties to consider SAF as a fuel for the aviation industry in the future. The number of agreements to purchase SAF continues to increase. The trend, as reported by WEF, has been evident since 2013. The peak occurred in 2023 with 42 SAF purchase agreements.

Despite its promise, obstacles are encountered in the development of SAF. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby stated that there is no sustainable aviation fuel whose costs are as competitive as traditional jet fuel. This includes the high costs associated with the adoption of new technologies and their production methods.

Another issue is that SAF has a lower density than traditional jet fuel. This means that 1 liter of conventional jet fuel contains more energy than 1 liter of SAF.

Thus, an aircraft can fly further using conventional jet fuel than SAF with the same amount. If SAF is used, the aircraft must carry a larger volume of fuel to operate long-distance flights.

""SAF production growth has slowed below expectations due to poorly designed mandates that stalled a fledgling industry. If the goal of SAF was to slow progress and raise prices, policymakers have succeeded,"" said IATA Director General Willie Walsh.

To boost production, stakeholders in the aviation sector, particularly the government, need to collaborate with industry players in the aviation business. Learning from failures and collaborating with airlines to design incentives will be beneficial in accelerating the adoption of SAF.

In Europe, for example, the promotion of the use of sustainable aviation fuel has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and an oligopolistic supply chain.

Fuel suppliers are widening their profit margins, causing airlines to pay five times higher than conventional prices or double the market price. This occurs without any guarantee of supply.

The cumulative impact of poorly designed policy frameworks affects airlines that will need to pay 2.9 billion USD for 1.9 million tons of SAF available in 2025. As a result, the standard price of SAF remains above that of conventional fuel.

The failure to accelerate SAF production capacity will impact the reassessment of SAF targets by many airlines. ""Many airlines committed to using 10 percent SAF by 2030 will be forced to evaluate this target,"" said Walsh as quoted from the IATA website.

He added that SAF is not produced in sufficient quantities to support these airlines in achieving their ambitions. These commitments were made in good faith, but cannot be fulfilled.

Government efforts

Indonesia has begun to follow the global trend in the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). At least two airlines have tested the use of SAF in commercial flights. Garuda Indonesia experimented with it in 2023 on a commercial flight covering a distance of 455 kilometers with a total duration of 60 minutes. The journey utilized a blend of 2.4 percent SAF provided by Pertamina.

Furthermore, Pelita Air plans to use SAF for the Jakarta-Bali route in August 2025. Its fuel will utilize used cooking oil or waste oil from restaurants, households, and micro, small, and medium enterprises.

In its development until 2026, the government assesses that there has been progress in the adoption of SAF, although it is still in the early stages of widespread implementation. The government, through the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, has issued Ministerial Decree Number 4 of 2025 concerning the Management and Utilization of Biofuels. This regulation serves as the legal basis for the production and use of SAF domestically.

From the regulatory side of the aviation sector, the Director General of Air Transportation at the Ministry of Transportation, Lukman F Laisa, stated that they have issued a Circular Letter regarding the Use of Renewable Fuel for Turbine Engine Aircraft.

This means that the government provides legal certainty for national air transport enterprises in using SAF. This was marked by the flight of Pelita Air last August.

Subsequently, the government established the National SAF Team in November 2025. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation, assigned as the coordinator for the demand sector, is currently formulating demand pillar policies, including stimulus and incentive schemes. This effort is aimed at encouraging the involvement of all stakeholders in the SAF ecosystem collectively.

""In accordance with the national SAF roadmap, mandatory SAF implementation is targeted to begin in 2027, with an initial national blending rate of 1 percent. Priority will be given to international flights at the two largest international airports, Soekarno-Hatta and I Gusti Ngurah Rai,"" Lukman said in a written statement.

Separately, the Director of Air Transportation Agustinus Budi stated that the adoption and use of SAF in commercial aircraft must still consider the readiness and availability of its stock. This aspect will affect fuel prices, which could potentially drive up ticket prices.

""Ultimately, it will impact ticket prices. High ticket prices will become another problem. Well, that's a dilemma. However, whatever decision the government makes regarding the implementation of SAF, all stakeholders must be ready, operators must be ready, and the public must be ready,"" said Agustinus.

Many considerations

The plan for the adoption and implementation of SAF needs to be designed and carefully planned. This is because forced utilization without a comprehensive design can lead to high costs, rather than attempting to reduce expenditures.

Indonesia AirAsia Acting President Director Achmad Sadikin Abdurachman revealed that his company remains focused on carbon offsets, arguing that this mechanism is easier to implement and strengthens the Indonesian government's commitment to sustainability.

Carbon offsets are schemes where individuals or companies compensate for greenhouse gas emissions, including those from aviation, to fund environmental projects that absorb or reduce carbon elsewhere. Two examples are reforestation and waste management.

""For SAF itself, it is still within a longer timeframe because it requires several preparations and also readiness from other parties. This is because, apart from the oil refineries that exist in Indonesia, there is also the readiness regarding price determination, which I believe is not insignificant,"" said Sadikin.

Sadikin hopes that all stakeholders have thoroughly calculated the use of SAF so that it does not become a burden. Nevertheless, he does not deny that several countries have begun to implement SAF.

A similar statement was made by aviation expert, Alvin Lie. The mandatory use of SAF will certainly drive up the operational costs for airlines. Pertamina's capacity to produce SAF also needs to be assessed in terms of its ability to meet demand when the policy is implemented.

In the past, palm oil-based SAF was developed, but the international community did not recognize the contribution of this raw material in reducing emissions. Therefore, Pertamina is now developing used cooking oil as a raw material for SAF. However, the procurement ecosystem is considered not yet stable enough to supply in large quantities.

""Currently, Pertamina is capable of producing the national avtur needs independently. We do not import. Let us not end up having to import due to SAF,"" he said.

The government's initiative to begin organizing the SAF ecosystem indeed requires support. However, this effort needs to be accompanied by careful planning and schemes, both in terms of production capacity, demand, and its impact on airline operating costs. It is only fitting that all stakeholders prepare for this change in order to contribute to global targets.

In its development until 2026, the government assesses that there has been progress in the adoption of SAF, although it is still in the early stages of widespread implementation. The government, through the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, has issued Ministerial Decree Number 4 of 2025 concerning the Management and Utilization of Biofuels. This regulation serves as the legal basis for the production and use of SAF domestically.

From the regulatory side of the aviation sector, the Director General of Air Transportation at the Ministry of Transportation, Lukman F Laisa, stated that they have issued a Circular Letter regarding the Use of Renewable Fuel for Turbine Engine Aircraft.

This means that the government provides legal certainty for national air transport enterprises in using SAF. This was marked by the flight of Pelita Air last August.

Subsequently, the government established the National SAF Team in November 2025. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation, assigned as the coordinator for the demand sector, is currently formulating demand pillar policies, including stimulus and incentive schemes. This effort is aimed at encouraging the involvement of all stakeholders in the SAF ecosystem collectively.

""In accordance with the national SAF roadmap, mandatory SAF implementation is targeted to begin in 2027, with an initial national blending rate of 1 percent. Priority will be given to international flights at the two largest international airports, Soekarno-Hatta and I Gusti Ngurah Rai,"" Lukman said in a written statement.

Separately, the Director of Air Transportation Agustinus Budi stated that the adoption and use of SAF in commercial aircraft must still consider the readiness and availability of its stock. This aspect will affect fuel prices, which could potentially drive up ticket prices.

""Ultimately, it will impact ticket prices. High ticket prices will become another problem. Well, that's a dilemma. However, whatever decision the government makes regarding the implementation of SAF, all stakeholders must be ready, operators must be ready, and the public must be ready,"" said Agustinus.

Many considerations

The plan for the adoption and implementation of SAF needs to be designed and carefully planned. This is because forced utilization without a comprehensive design can lead to high costs, rather than attempting to reduce expenditures.

Indonesia AirAsia Acting President Director Achmad Sadikin Abdurachman revealed that his company remains focused on carbon offsets, arguing that this mechanism is easier to implement and strengthens the Indonesian government's commitment to sustainability.

Carbon offsets are schemes where individuals or companies compensate for greenhouse gas emissions, including those from aviation, to fund environmental projects that absorb or reduce carbon elsewhere. Two examples are reforestation and waste management.

""For SAF itself, it is still within a longer timeframe because it requires several preparations and also readiness from other parties. This is because, apart from the oil refineries that exist in Indonesia, there is also the readiness regarding price determination, which I believe is not insignificant,"" said Sadikin.

Sadikin hopes that all stakeholders have thoroughly calculated the use of SAF so that it does not become a burden. Nevertheless, he does not deny that several countries have begun to implement SAF.

A similar statement was made by aviation expert, Alvin Lie. The mandatory use of SAF will certainly drive up the operational costs for airlines. Pertamina's capacity to produce SAF also needs to be assessed in terms of its ability to meet demand when the policy is implemented.

In the past, palm oil-based SAF was developed, but the international community did not recognize the contribution of this raw material in reducing emissions. Therefore, Pertamina is now developing used cooking oil as a raw material for SAF. However, the procurement ecosystem is considered not yet stable enough to supply in large quantities.

""Currently, Pertamina is capable of producing the national avtur needs independently. We do not import. Let us not end up having to import due to SAF,"" he said.

The government's initiative to begin organizing the SAF ecosystem indeed requires support. However, this effort needs to be accompanied by careful planning and schemes, both in terms of production capacity, demand, and its impact on airline operating costs. It is only fitting that all stakeholders prepare for this change in order to contribute to global targets.",https://assetd.kompas.id/jU00ccQb1HYNLqokZ2t1VK-T1sg=/1024x683/smart/filters:format(webp):quality(75)/https://cdn-dam.kompas.id/images/2025/12/27/af131f067c7ffc35c8ab5185c5d178d5-US_WINTER_STORM_SNARLS_AIR_TRAVEL_IN_CHICAGO_134422581.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 23:57:39.937044

To better understand the logistics of material transport and handoffs, we integrated models of biomass harvest, transport, ethanol, and ATJ production in a stochastic framework based on Monte Carlo simulations to characterize SAF minimum selling price (MSP) and carbon intensity (CI), considering site-specific parameters (e.g., feedstock production, transportation, taxes, incentives). The results indicate trade-offs between MSP and CI across locations, with median MSP ranging from 7.9 to 12.8 USD·gal–1 and CI from −9.7 to 39.4 gCO2e·MJ–1. Despite high estimated decarbonization costs (580 USD·tonCO2e–1), our results indicate that site-specific deployment of ATJ with low-CI feedstocks can improve sustainability outcomes.

""We have done so in a measured way and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.""","Travelers flying out of Singapore in 2026 will see a slight increase in their airfare, but it's for a good reason.

Singapore is introducing a sustainable aviation fuel levy on all flights departing the country, according to Euronews. The cost helps subsidize the transition to 1% SAF use in 2026. The amount of tax varies depending on the country passengers are flying to, as destinations are divided into tiered bands.

For example, for those flying to Southeast Asia (closer to Singapore), the cost can be as much as four Singapore dollars ($3.11) depending on cabin class. Meanwhile, flights to North America are in band five, meaning levies range from 10.40 and 41.60 Singapore dollars ($8.10-32.28).

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) introduced the fee to help the aviation industry reduce pollution. While some people might chafe at the extra cost, it's worth considering it a way to support eco-friendly business initiatives.

An additional fee is annoying now, but it's a small price to pay for securing a stable, healthy future for the planet. If we don't make the switch from dirty fuel now, we risk paying trillions later to address health issues, extreme weather damage, and rising energy costs.

One study found that using sustainable aviation fuel could cut airline pollution by 80% to 90%. It can also be made from food scraps, potentially addressing two major areas of waste.

Food waste costs retailers and businesses $540 billion annually. When these scraps lands in the dump, they even contribute to the gases that pollute the atmosphere and warm the planet. A rising demand for SAF could mean a new purpose for this waste and a greener future for flying.

Director-General of CAAS Han Hok Juan acknowledged that the new SAF levy might take some convincing. However, it is a necessary step forward in making air travel more sustainable.

""We need to make a start,"" Han Hok Juan told Euronews. ""We have done so in a measured way and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/sustainable-aviation-fuelimage-rec1yZZOsPOL4rCxM.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 21:56:49.657910

Commissioning and start-up of the plant were successfully achieved in October 2025. The facility also produces hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and renewable naphtha, with a combined maximum production capacity of 420,000 metric tons per year, reinforcing the company’s position in the global renewable fuels landscape and underscoring Hong Kong’s contribution as a platform for green innovation and investment.

As host of the ceremony and a founding investor of EcoCeres, Peter Lee, chairman of Towngas and principal of Full Vision Capital, warmly welcomed YB Datuk Seri Noraini Ahmad, Minister of Plantation and Commodities Malaysia, and invited her to officiate the inauguration of EcoCeres’ first SAF plant in Malaysia. The ceremony was further graced by Eddie Cheung, JP, Permanent Secretary for Environment and Ecology of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, together with EcoCeres co-chairmen Alan Chan and James Tam, and CEO Matti Lievonen. Their presence marked a significant milestone and underscored the Hong Kong-headquartered company’s pivotal role in advancing cross-border collaboration in the low-carbon economy.

Reflecting on EcoCeres’ journey, Peter Lee said, “EcoCeres has grown from a laboratory in Hong Kong into one of the world’s leading producers of SAF, and this new Johor plant shows how regional commitment to sustainability can feed into the global search for climate solutions. With supportive government policies and the dedication of all our partners, we can turn the tide on climate change for future generations.”

“EcoCeres shares Hong Kong SAR Government’s vision of achieving carbon neutrality and being a superconnector. The Johor SAF plant is a shining example of a Hong Kong company with a global vision putting one of its production facilities in a strategic location in the region.” said Eddie Cheung, JP, Permanent Secretary for Environment and Ecology of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

As a technology‑driven company, EcoCeres has developed its own proprietary waste‑to‑fuel processes in Hong Kong and successfully scaled them through its first facility in Zhangjiagang, China, which has helped the company become one of the world’s leading SAF producers by volume. “The Johor plant is a major step forward for EcoCeres’ regional platform and for Malaysia’s renewable fuel industry,” said Matti Lievonen, CEO of EcoCeres. “It also demonstrates our commitment to reliable supply capability and high product quality as customers’ demand for renewable fuel solutions accelerates. This facility supports Malaysia’s transition towards net-zero while strengthening Hong Kong’s strategic position as a regional hub for financing and scaling sustainable energy projects, enabling the supply of sustainable fuels to global industries. Our waste-to-fuel technology proves that economic growth and environmental stewardship can go hand-in-hand.”

The establishment of this facility is aligned with Malaysia’s commitment to advancing renewable fuel development and adopting waste-to-fuel approaches to achieve its net-zero emissions target by 2050. At the same time, it showcases how Hong Kong’s innovation capabilities, capital markets, and professional services ecosystem can enable the deployment of climate solutions across the region, with EcoCeres serving as a prime example of a Hong Kong‑founded company commercialising home‑grown technologies at scale overseas. By converting waste and residue feedstocks into high-value, low-carbon renewable fuels, EcoCeres supports Malaysia’s transition toward a sustainable and circular economy while addressing the growing demand for renewable fuels across aviation, maritime, transportation, mining, and chemical industries.

“The Malaysian government proudly supports EcoCeres’ pioneering facility, which aligns with our National Energy Transition Roadmap and National Agri-commodity Policy (DAKN) 2030,” said YB Datuk Seri Noraini Ahmad, Minister of Plantation and Commodities Malaysia. “By fostering innovation in renewable fuels, we are creating high-value jobs, reducing carbon emissions, and strengthening Malaysia’s role as a leader in the green economy. This project exemplifies our commitment to sustainable industrial development.”

EcoCeres remains committed to expanding its global footprint in renewable fuels, leveraging pioneering proprietary technologies to meet the increasing demand for sustainable energy solutions. From its Zhangjiagang plant in China to the new Johor facility in Malaysia, the company is building a regional platform anchored in Hong Kong that turns waste to wonders, supports global decarbonization efforts and reinforces Hong Kong’s position as a super-connector for green development in Asia.

In addition to the Malaysian facility, EcoCeres’ Zhangjiagang plan also produces SAF and HVO bringing its combined maximum global renewable fuels capacity to approximately 770,000 metric tons per year and further enhancing Hong Kong’s role as the headquarters of an integrated regional renewable fuels platform.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Eco_Ceres_Jan26_c1ecc5b64a.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 19:56:50.845608

Stepping into this role felt like a natural next step for me. My experience lines up well with where the association is headed and the needs it’s working to address.

Skies: How has your past experience prepared you for this?

HS: I’ve had a long and varied aviation career that began with ab initio training and flight instructing. From there, I worked my way through day freight operations, including specialized cargo flights out of Chalk River with a Mitsubishi MU-2, before moving into night freight flying a Beech 1900 and Falcon 20 on contracts with FedEx and Airborne Express.

I then spent a period with the Ottawa Police in surveillance and special missions operations. After that, I joined Bombardier’s Commercial Aircraft Division, primarily on the Dash 8 program. My responsibilities expanded to include the CRJ, and I was also involved in the development program for the CSeries — now the Airbus A220.

That role gave me the opportunity to work closely with international customers, support training programs, and help establish operational and training organizations around the world. I also lived in several countries while conducting consolidation training for pilots transitioning from simulator to line operations.

When Bombardier divested its commercial aircraft division to focus on business aviation, I moved to De Havilland Canada. There, I helped establish systems for both experimental and production flight testing, including the DH-6 Twin Otter, CL215/415/515 waterbombers, and the Shorts Sherpa.

Throughout this time, I developed strong working relationships with Transport Canada and built deep operational regulatory experience. At De Havilland, I also led the process of establishing a private operator certificate. This was necessary as we prepared to operate a corporate shuttle and conduct aircraft ferry and delivery flights, which fall under a different regulatory framework than production flying.

Looking back, the progression feels very natural — from special missions and freight operations to commercial programs, and into business aviation and private operator certification. Taken together, it’s given me hands-on experience across nearly every facet of aviation operations.

Skies: What do you think is the biggest benefit of business aviation here in Canada?

HS: Business aviation isn’t just private jets. It spans everything from single-engine piston and turbine aircraft to twin-engine turboprops and turbojets — and even some repurposed commercial aircraft flying in business roles.

These aircraft are essential tools for companies, helping them move people and equipment efficiently and operate at the pace business requires.

Skies: What are your top priorities for the year ahead, and for your term as CEO?

HS: My 30-60-90-day plan is really about listening. I want to meet with board members, operators, and as many members as I can to understand what we’re doing well, where we’re really strong, and where there’s room to improve. It’s basically a cross-country listening tour to make sure we’re focused on what matters most to members.

The first 30 days will be full-on. We have chapter meetings happening across the country, so I’ll be travelling quite a bit and meeting operators in different provinces. Then, before you know it, we’re into the 90-day mark and right up against our convention in Calgary in June — so it’s definitely a “drinking from a fire hose” kind of start.

At the same time, there’s no shortage of active files. We’re working closely with Transport Canada and Nav Canada, dealing with airport access and slots, and coordinating with Canada Border Services on cross-border processes and airport entry. Those relationships are critical for our members’ day-to-day operations.

And of course, with the 2026 FIFA World Cup coming to Canada, we’re expecting a major influx of aircraft. We want to make sure key gateways like Vancouver and Toronto are ready to handle that level of traffic smoothly.

There’s a lot going on, but for me, the top priority right out of the gate is simple: Get out there, meet members, and build the trust and confidence that I’m here to lead and represent them well.

Skies: Are there any major issues on your radar right now?

HS: We’ve had some real advocacy wins in the past. One of the big ones was successfully removing business aircraft from the federal luxury tax. Now we’re focused on pursuing measures similar to what our neighbours in the U.S. have, particularly around accelerated depreciation for aviation assets.

Those U.S. incentives can influence where companies choose to do business — where they buy aircraft, and where those aircraft are registered. When that activity shifts south of the border, Canada loses out. Keeping those investments here supports our own economy and generates important spin-offs like maintenance, skilled labour, fuelling, and hangarage.

We’re also putting more emphasis on the turboprop community. It’s a fast-growing segment in Canada, and we want to make sure those operators see the CBAA as their home and their voice.

Those are key priorities, but at the end of the day, the most important thing is getting out and listening to members. Understanding their most pressing issues and advocating on their behalf is exactly what CBAA is here to do.

Skies: Another focus in the past has been sustainability, particularly via the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Is that another of your priorities, going forward?

HS: Yes, it’s definitely a priority. We’re part of the Climbing Fast initiative, and we’re watching developments around sustainable aviation fuel very closely. A big part of the challenge is scale — having enough supply, the right production capacity, and reliable distribution networks. All of those pieces need to come together.

It would be great to say we can move to 100 percent SAF tomorrow, but without that supporting infrastructure in place, it’s very difficult to make that a reality.

That said, being environmentally responsible is absolutely important to us. It’s something the industry is taking seriously, and we want to be part of the solution as the ecosystem continues to develop.

Skies: How do you plan to ensure the CBAA is a truly national organization that represents the needs of the community?

HS: We’re seeing really strong growth in business aviation across the Prairie provinces. There are more operators now in places like Winnipeg, Regina, and Saskatoon, and Calgary is continuing to grow as an aviation hub — especially with De Havilland establishing operations there. So in many ways, that national footprint already exists.

At the same time, the major airports — Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Montreal, and Halifax — remain key centres for larger business activity, and that’s reflected in our membership as well.

With upcoming chapter meetings, I’ll be travelling across the country in April to connect directly with members and make sure every region feels equally represented and heard.

Skies: Your predecessor, Anthony Norejko, was on the job for about seven years. Is your time as CEO a fixed term, or is it open-ended?

HS: Yes, it’s open-ended. I’ll continue in the role for as long as the board and the membership feel I’m the right person to lead.

Anthony has done an outstanding job, and I’ve been working closely with him over the past couple of weeks to ensure a strong transition. He’s been walking me through the key files and making important introductions with the various boards and partners we work with.

His support has really helped set me up to hit the ground running.

Skies: You mentioned the CBAA convention is coming up in June. Is there anything special we can look forward to there?

HS: It’s a really big annual convention; we’re expecting over 600 people to attend. We kick things off the day before the show with our golf tournament, which supports Hope Air.

The first day is all about education. We bring in topics that our members have told us they want to hear about, whether it’s AI, new rules, or regulations for flying around the world.

Of course, we also have a static display and a trade show. It’s really a chance for everyone to come together, network, and make the connections that help their businesses run more effectively.

Another key focus is sharing best practices. You can’t reinvent the wheel at every company; there’s real value in learning from other people’s successes and even their mistakes.

It’s an incredible opportunity to learn and grow, and we’re excited to keep that tradition going this year.

Skies: Have you started thinking about how you’d like to be remembered?

HS: It’s only my second week, so I’m still getting my feet wet, but I already have a good sense of the organization’s history and where it’s come from. I also have some ideas about where it’s headed. My goal is to leave the association in an even stronger position, ensuring that business aviation continues to thrive and grow.

Skies: What is your final message to the industry, for now? Is there anything you’d like them to take away from this piece?

HS: Aviation in Canada — and really, worldwide — is a small, close-knit family. We’re all in this together: Advocating for our industry, promoting safety, and looking for efficiencies. Whether you’re in commercial aviation, business aviation, a large airline, a small operator, or a flight training school, we all share the same goals.

Let’s keep that family mentality alive, and work together to maintain a safe, efficient, and thriving industry.",https://assets.skiesmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Harlan-Simpkins-wide-3.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 17:58:03.896323

The 2025 legislative session showed that California can sustain climate progress even in a challenging political and economic environment.","While much of the climate and energy conversation in 2025 focused on federal action, some of the most consequential progress occurred at the state level. In our recent webinar, “2025 Wins and Trends in State Climate Policy,” Clean Air Task Force (CATF) staff from across the country shared insights on where states are making progress, the headwinds they face, and what opportunities lie ahead in 2026.

Below are key takeaways from that conversation, drawing on examples from each region of the United States.

State climate action is critical

State governments make daily decisions that shape both near-term and long-term emissions outcomes—through legislation, permitting, regulatory implementation, and grant programs. States develop policy innovations that can spread to other states and scale to the federal level.

State leadership is especially critical during periods of federal uncertainty and gridlock. State policy supports market stability, provides long-term signals for investment in clean technologies, and continues progress on emissions reductions. U.S. states also have an important role internationally through collaborations with national and subnational governments, participation and presence in international climate conferences, and demonstration of continued progress on emissions reductions.

Dynamics affecting state climate policy

Across the country, several dynamics are shaping state climate and energy policy:

Affordability: Rising costs for electricity, housing, healthcare, and food have made affordability a central household and political issue.

Rapid load growth: Data centers, AI, and electrification are driving unprecedented demand for electricity, requiring additional generation and transmission.

Federal uncertainty and funding cuts: Legal challenges to regulations, funding cuts, and potential limits on state authority are complicating long-term planning across industries.

Political polarization: Climate and energy policy must contend with an environment of ongoing political polarization and strengthened skepticism toward government and institutions.

National trends in state climate policy

Despite these challenging dynamics, states continue to act, and in many cases, lead. Several trends emerged across regions in 2025, which provide a strong foundation for climate policy in 2026.

Continued state leadership, as many governors and legislatures continue to advance policies that reduce emissions.

Deployment of innovative technologies, with many state leaders in both parties supporting zero- or low-emission technologies such as nuclear, geothermal, and carbon capture.

Growing support for clean firm power, including nuclear, geothermal, and carbon capture, as states confront reliability and affordability challenges.

Increased focus on renewable energy deployment, through improved state/local siting frameworks, permitting reform, and pushes to utilize expiring federal tax credits.

Renewed momentum on nuclear energy, including repealing moratoria, increasing state funding, investing in workforce development, and planning new projects.

Affordability-centered climate framing, with climate policies framed in the context of affordability, reliability, and economic competitiveness.

Budgetary challenges, resulting from federal funding cuts to states, which may limit new state funding and jeopardize traditional funding streams.

Regional highlights

The following regional highlights cover topics that CATF or CATF Action was involved in. These highlights are meant to be illustrative, not comprehensive, as there have been important state policy actions on building efficiency, electric vehicles, resilience, and other topics not discussed here.

Northeast: Recalibration and clean firm focus

In New York, ambitious climate targets collided with cost pressures and federal barriers to offshore wind. While the state is now expected to miss its 2030 renewable target, the state’s latest energy plan shows it remains on track for a 100% clean grid by 2040—largely due to a renewed emphasis on nuclear power. For the first time, New York explicitly assessed nuclear power in its power system modeling, and it found that adding additional nuclear capacity could make it easier and less costly to meet the 2040 target. The state is supporting existing reactors, planning new nuclear capacity, investing in workforce development, and developing a statewide nuclear master plan that will be finalized by the end of 2026.

Pennsylvania faced legislative gridlock and ultimately withdrew from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, leaving a policy gap for grid decarbonization. The state environmental agency launched a federally funded $396 million industrial decarbonization grant program that may catalyze one of the largest industrial clean energy clusters in the country.

2025 saw increased interest in nuclear power in many states across the Northeast. For example, New Jersey worked on legislation to advance nuclear and other clean technologies and newly elected-Gov. Mickie Sherril has indicated she will continue to pursue those goals; Massachusetts is developing a nuclear roadmap that will be finalized in April 2026; and several states are engaged in a multistate coordination effort on advanced nuclear, led by the National Association of State Energy Officials.

Southeast: Load growth drives the conversation

Climate and clean energy policy in Virginia and North Carolina, much like the rest of the region, was shaped by projections of surging load growth. Forecasts of increased electricity demand, driven largely by data centers, have made reliability and system planning central policy concerns. Across the region, policymakers are increasingly open to clean firm resources as part of a balanced, affordable clean energy mix. At the same time, utilities like Duke Energy and Dominion are pushing for new natural gas peaker plants to meet demand.

Virginia took steps to classify fusion energy as carbon-free and reformed utility rate structures to better allocate costs from large energy users. North Carolina, however, passed a law eliminating the state’s requirement for 70% carbon dioxide emissions reductions by 2030, while preserving the 2050 carbon neutrality requirement.

Gulf Coast: Economic leadership on innovation

In Louisiana and Texas, clean energy policy is driven by economic competitiveness, industrial leadership, and reliability interests. In both states, political and local opposition to various clean energy technologies continues to impact the energy discourse. Often this opposition is premised around safety concerns, property rights, and public trust, which has led to several state policies that are more restrictive of some clean technologies such as solar, wind, and carbon capture and sequestration. But there has still been meaningful progress.

Louisiana advanced clean hydrogen policy through a bipartisan task force, issued its first Class VI CO2 storage permit, reorganized energy governance, and moved to streamline permitting for advanced nuclear projects.

Texas enacted one of the most ambitious nuclear policy packages in the country, establishing a dedicated nuclear office, permitting officer, and a $350 million deployment fund. The state also made major progress on geothermal policy through financial and regulatory support, and Texas recently was granted primacy over Class VI carbon sequestration wells from the EPA.

Midwest: Nuclear resurgence and industrial decarbonization

Illinois saw nuclear energy become politically viable again, driven by affordability, reliability, and a 100% carbon free energy requirement by 2050. The state fully lifted its nuclear moratorium, passed a major grid reliability and affordability package, invested heavily in public transit, and advanced protections for critical aquifers amid carbon capture debates.

Michigan experienced slower legislative progress due to divided government, but nuclear and carbon capture gained bipartisan traction. The restart of the Palisades nuclear plant – the first reactor restart in U.S. history – symbolized the region’s renewed nuclear momentum. The legislature also began considering a low carbon fuels standard.

West: Implementation and infrastructure take center stage

Colorado passed several clean energy-related bills during the 2025 session. This includes legislation to support the deployment of advanced nuclear technology to meet the state’s clean electricity goal and to modernize state regulation to accommodate next-generation geothermal and carbon capture technologies. Another new law seeks to accelerate transmission buildout by co-locating new transmission lines along existing rights of way, like highways, to avoid potential conflicts with private landowners and wildlife habitat.

New Mexico passed bills during its 2025 legislative session that advanced carbon capture rules, increased geothermal funding, modernized the grid, and leveraged its energy revenues to fund climate programs, including a newly established $210 million Community Benefit Fund for climate projects.

Washington’s new governor hit the ground running by signing bills that streamlined permitting for fusion and updated the state’s low-carbon fuel standard. Washington has a 100% by 2045 clean electricity standard but is facing budget constraints and other obstacles such as transmission bottlenecks and other grid infrastructure issues. The state advanced important administrative steps on sustainable aviation fuel, forest carbon offsets, and a geothermal energy collaborative process.

California: Balancing climate ambition and affordability

California had one of its most consequential climate years in recent memory, despite intense federal pressure and scrutiny of its climate programs and regulatory frameworks. This year’s legislative session was defined by efforts to pair climate ambition with affordability, with major bills aimed at cutting costs, stabilizing markets, and advancing clean energy deployment. Policy wins included transmission financing reform to lower costs, regional grid coordination, reauthorization of the cap-and-invest program through 2045, streamlined geothermal permitting, and lifting the moratorium on intrastate carbon dioxide transport. The 2025 legislative session showed that California can sustain climate progress even in a challenging political and economic environment.

What to watch in 2026

As we look ahead to 2026, states will face a mix of headwinds and tailwinds when approaching climate and clean energy policy.

Ongoing concerns about affordability and the need to address it directly when discussing existing and new climate and clean energy policies.

Impacts of AI on load growth, electricity costs, and local economies, as well as public sentiment about AI.

Momentum gained by increased deployment of innovative technologies with bipartisan support (e.g., geothermal, nuclear, fusion, and transmission/grid upgrades) tempered with uncertainty for those technologies created by federal legislative and regulatory actions.

2026 elections, including 36 governors, thousands of state legislators, federal House and Senate, and utilities commissioners across nine states, including Louisiana.

Efforts to weaken state authorities for energy and climate policy.

Across regions, states are demonstrating that climate progress does not require uniform politics or unlimited budgets.

The most obvious elephant-not-in-the-room is Boeing. The US airframer has no commercial aircraft represented in either the static or flying displays. While it is understandable that Boeing has kept a low profile in the aftermath of the 737 MAX 9 mid-cabin door plug blowout two years ago, one might have expected a stronger showing in 2026 as it looks to regain momentum in one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets.

Boeing’s last major presence at the show was in 2022, when it flew its 777-9 demonstrator halfway around the globe. The manufacturer did subsequently send the aircraft to the Dubai Airshow in November 2025, where big spenders Emirates placed an order for 65 of the type.

With major Asia-Pacific carriers such as ANA, Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines having already placed relatively modest orders for the delayed program and now awaiting deliveries, the decision not to showcase the aircraft to future passengers and clients in the region does leave a slightly sour taste.

Airbus, by contrast, maintained a steady presence. The European manufacturer brought two A350-1000s for the first time—a demonstrator for the flying display and a Starlux aircraft for static display—alongside an Air Nigini A220. Missing, however, was the A330neo, which had appeared at both the 2022 and 2024 shows.

COMAC, which grabbed headlines in 2024, returned with both the C919 and C909, including a C919 in the flying display. The Chinese manufacturer continues to view Southeast Asia as a key beachhead for pushing its portfolio into the international market.

Even as major carriers in the region prioritizes aircraft acquisitions from the US as a trade negotiation tool, Embraer, meanwhile, is still looking to carve a niche and pressing its regional aviation pitch with a single E195-E2 from Mongolian carrier Hunnu Air on display.

On the ground, aviation sustainability may finally be inching forward as a more concrete theme in 2026. Singapore is set to launch its sustainable aviation fuel levy later this year, a move that is drawing interest from regulators globally. In conjunction, an increased number of SAF refineries are becoming operational in the region.

The new site, which Delta previewed last August, will roll out to customers through February.

Delta managing director of sales and distribution innovation Sara Reid, who demoed the platform for BTN, said some of the platform travel agency functionality will be developed through 2026.

Reid said 40 early pilot customers praised the new site's simplicity and functionality, and called it ""a significant improvement"" over Delta Professional.

The new site after customer login offers a dashboard, ""which is truly a one-stop-shop for a quick comprehensive view of your entire Delta Business experience,"" Reid said.

The dashboard includes a ""wallet"" that tracks three types of benefits:

Loyalty tokens, used to award medallion status

Amenity points, used for ticket purchases, changes or upgrades

Service points, used for unused ticket transfer fees and in the future to track agency actions ""as it relates to exceptions and things like that,"" Reid said.

As customers navigate through the site, the wallet will remain in the top right-hand corner.

Delta also introduced a ""partnership value"" figure that includes a customer's contract value—including global account savings, the total of a customer's service and amenity points—and their experience value. The latter figure includes loyalty tokens and experiences like corporate priority, preferred seats—which corporate customers have complimentary access to—and free Wi-Fi, ""which a lot of business travelers do pay for with other airlines,"" Reid said.

Delta is using the last 12 months of data to display in that area, Reid said.

Customers also will be able to complete ""quick actions"" to assess status, like unused tickets, for example, without leaving the dashboard. Eventually, Reid said, this feature could be used to resolve in-trip issues. In the future, ""you could as a travel manager or agency click to be able to give [a traveler at an airport] access to a drink voucher or something like that,"" Reid said. ""Our intent long-term is to upgrade the travel experience for customers through quick actions from the site.""

A new contract performance section allows users to track progress against their negotiated goals, including specific markets, Reid added.

""This is a level of transparency that we haven't really provided, but customers have been asking for, and we're really excited to be able to deliver it in a way that's very intuitive and actionable ... giving customers a clear view of performance and value,"" she said. ""We also want to shift into loyalty where they can get a deeper look into how their travelers are engaging with Delta and how they can strategically use this new wallet, specifically their loyalty tokens.""

In addition, customers will be able to see their travelers' loyalty status breakdown, including percentage who are SkyMiles members and their distribution across Medallion tiers. ""This is something that we've provided on reports before, but never alongside this wallet capability,"" Reid added.

The ability to use service points to waive the unused ticket transfer fee ""is one of the biggest wins"" for customers, ""as we heard a lot about the fee, so we incorporated that into the design,"" Reid said. Based on a customer suggestion, corporate clients now can choose to direct the value of unused tickets toward the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel.

Companies can use amenity points to support travelers with new tickets, ticket changes and see upgrades. ""This is the first time customers can initiate a seat upgrade without having to call into our global sales solutions center,"" Reid noted.

In October the UN body's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) put off a vote on its Net Zero Framework for a year after significant opposition to it emerged, throwing into doubt shipping's timeline for when it will be charged for its greenhouse gas emissions.

Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez spoke to reporters at the IMO's London headquarters last week to give an update on the organisation's thinking on the issue, among other topics.

Since October's delay there have been reports of some green fuel producers putting production investments on hold, or mulling whether to pivot towards other markets like sustainable aviation fuel instead of targeting the shipping industry.

""It's always difficult to attract investment into shipping,"" Domiguez told Ship & Bunker at the event on Friday.

""We have already started, and we are on our pathway to decarbonisation.

""We face some obstacles on the way; we need to stay positive and address those obstacles that happen in normal daily life, and we don't just stop, or collapse or abandon.

""The industry continues to drive into how we're going to be more sustainable, more efficient, and that is going to allow us as well to compete with other modes of transport.""

No New Timeline for NZF Vote

Dominguez declined to provide an updated timeline on when a new vote on the NZF might be scheduled.

The MEPC is due to hold its next meeting in April, and he said his focus for now was on meeting as many delegations as possible before then to gauge their thinking.

""I wouldn't focus on whether this is going to be an urgency or not,"" Dominguez said.

""We have a pathway, because we have recognised the need for us to address the negative impact of shipping on the environment.

By Steven Scheer

JERUSALEM, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Boeing and Israel's Technion university said on Tuesday they were beginning to develop Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from ​feedstocks including green hydrogen and carbon dioxide to enable the aviation ‌sector's long-term growth.

SAF, made largely from waste or used cooking oil, can cut emissions significantly compared with ‌traditional jet fuel. However, it remains two to five times more expensive than conventional fuel.

Boeing and Technion said following the completion of an initial feasibility phase, development was set to begin and move towards ""competitive commercial production.""

Boeing has committed to delivering commercial ⁠airplanes capable of flying 100% ‌on SAF by 2030, while the commercial aviation industry seeks to achieve zero net emissions by 2050.

Although airline industry leaders have ‍pointed to a wave of new SAF initiatives they say will spark a boom similar to the rapid rise of electric vehicles and solar energy, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), ​a global body that represents 340 airlines, forecast SAF would account for ‌only 0.7% of total jet fuel in 2025, and the 2050 target could be missed.

Boeing said the process to develop SAF on a large scale could still take a few years. SAF can be made from a variety of sources such as cover crops and other non-edible plants, agricultural and forestry waste, non-recyclable municipal ⁠waste, industrial plant off-gassing and other feedstocks

Separately, ​Boeing and Israel's Ben-Gurion University said they were ​establishing a cybersecurity research centre for next-generation aviation and aerospace systems.

Boeing Global President Brendan Nelson, currently in Israel, said the company was ‍working to ""enhance energy security, ⁠support the growth of the civil aviation industry, and create new economic opportunities through sustainable aviation fuel and other technologies.""

Technion President Uri Sivan said ⁠it was on a mission to develop technologies for producing clean fuels that would make a ""significant ‌contribution to aviation—and no less importantly, to human health and the ‌environment.""

GE Aerospace is developing a narrowbody hybrid electric architecture that embeds electric motor/generators in a gas turbine engine to supplement power during different phases of operation. The design optimizes performance and creates a system that can work with or without energy storage like batteries.

“Hybrid electric propulsion is central to how GE Aerospace is redefining the future of flight,” said Arjan Hegeman, vice president of future of flight for GE Aerospace. “Our latest milestone successfully demonstrated a narrowbody hybrid electric engine architecture that doesn’t require energy storage to operate. It’s a critical step to making hybrid electric flight a reality for commercial aviation with technologies that meet customer needs for greater efficiency, durability, and range.”

Testing exceeded NASA’s technical performance benchmarks. NASA based these measures on industry input about engine capabilities that would provide meaningful fuel cost savings for U.S. aviation while also meeting the power requirements of future aircraft.

RISE program testing

The Power Extraction Demonstration is one of several efforts GE Aerospace has underway to mature technologies for more electric aircraft engines through the CFM International RISE program.

Unveiled in 2021, the RISE program is one of the aviation industry’s most comprehensive technology demonstrators with more than 350 tests and more than 3,000 endurance cycles completed to date, including tests on advanced engine architectures like Open Fan, compact core and hybrid electric systems. The RISE program prioritizes safety, durability and efficiency, targeting more than 20% better fuel burn compared to commercial engines in service today.

CFM RISE program technologies are maturing toward ground and flight tests this decade with work underway on aircraft and engine integration in collaboration with partners.

Hybrid electric experience

GE Aerospace has achieved multiple hybrid electric milestones over the last decade, including a 2016 ground test of an electric motor-driven propeller. In 2022, GE Aerospace completed the world’s first test of a megawatt-class and multi-kilovolt (kV) hybrid electric propulsion system in altitude conditions up to 45,000 feet that simulate single-aisle commercial flight.

The visit highlighted the Boeing–Technion SAF Innovation Center, launched in 2023, which is focused on advancing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathways that could reduce aviation emissions while strengthening energy security and building a local innovation ecosystem, according to the partners.

Nelson, a physician by training and a former senior Australian government official, was appointed president of Boeing Global in January 2023, according to Boeing’s executive biography. During the Technion visit, Boeing said the initiative was part of the company’s broader effort to support sustainable aviation fuel development alongside other decarbonization measures.

“In addition to delivering high-quality fuel-efficient airplanes to our customers, Boeing works globally and regionally to enhance energy security, support the growth of the civil aviation industry, and create new economic opportunities through sustainable aviation fuel and other technologies,” Nelson said in remarks provided by the partners.

Boeing’s delegation also included Maj.-Gen. (res.) Ido Nehushtan, president of Boeing Israel, and Haggai Mazursky, described as the head of the SAF project. They were welcomed by Technion President Prof. Uri Sivan and senior Technion leadership, including Prof. Noam Adir, executive vice president for research, and Prof. Yuval Garini, executive vice president for innovation and industry relations.

Technion leaders framed the project as a national-scale effort that could link academic research to industrial capability.

“This is a historic collaboration of national importance for the State of Israel,” Sivan said. He added that the partnership represented “a vote of confidence” in Technion researchers and their ability to develop cleaner fuel production technologies.

From feasibility to 'Power-to-Liquid' development

According to the Israeli Sustainable Aviation Fuel Knowledge Center (iSAF), the Boeing–Technion SAF Innovation Center’s work has centered on “electrofuels” produced via Power-to-Liquid (PtL) processes that combine green hydrogen with captured carbon dioxide. The partners said the next stage would push the process toward practical development that can support commercial production at a competitive cost.

The center has been led by Prof. Gideon (Gidi) Grader of the Technion’s Wolfson Department of Chemical Engineering, according to Technion faculty information. The partners said 11 Technion faculty members and dozens of doctoral students from five faculties have worked on fuel production and qualification topics, including catalytic processes, combustion, safety, life-cycle analysis, and an experimental fuel-testing facility.

Boeing’s Israel footprint and a growing SAF ecosystem

Nehushtan said Boeing’s relationship with Israel spans decades, including commercial ties with El Al and defense cooperation with the Israeli Air Force, alongside a supplier network that integrates Israeli-made systems into Boeing products. Boeing’s published Israel background material describes a relationship that goes back more than 75 years, alongside commercial and defense partnerships and local supplier activity.

The Technion-Boeing initiative has unfolded alongside government-backed efforts to accelerate SAF research and development. In February 2025, the Israel Innovation Authority announced a NIS 100 million investment to establish a national SAF research consortium, bringing together industrial companies and academic research teams to develop technologies for renewable aviation fuels.

Industry and academia have also convened around SAF-IL, a consortium referenced in the Technion-hosted iSAF conference agenda as part of Israel Innovation Authority activity.

Work continued after October 7

The partners said the Boeing–Technion announcement had originally been planned for October 2023, but the initiative continued after the October 7 attacks and the war that followed. Nelson was quoted in the material describing the center as a “project of resilience and innovation,” and argued that Israel had the capacity to tackle aviation’s emissions challenge through research and commercialization.

Boeing said sustainable aviation fuel remains a major lever for reducing aviation emissions, and in a separate Boeing sustainability statement the company has said SAF can reduce CO2 emissions over the fuel’s life cycle by up to 85%, depending on feedstock and production pathway.","https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_720,w_1280/703666",N,,2026-01-27 11:09:09.516478

At the North Sea Summit on Monday, ministers from Britain, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway signed an agreement to develop 100 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity in shared economic waters. That’s enough to supply more than 50 million households.

The deal builds on a 2023 pledge to construct 300 GW of offshore wind by 2050, conceived after the energy‑price shock triggered by Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent disruption of gas flows to Europe.

While this latest announcement is years in the making, it lands at a delicate moment for Europe’s relationship with the U.S., given the recent transatlantic spat over Greenland.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s transactional diplomacy and his pursuit of “energy dominance” have sharpened European concerns about their heavy reliance on U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG), which replaced most of the volumes previously supplied by Russia.

U.S. gas accounted for 57% of all LNG imports into the EU and Britain in 2025 and around a quarter of the region’s total gas imports.

Wind power has long been the cornerstone of Northern Europe’s strategy to slash its fossil fuel dependency, with onshore and offshore wind generating 19% of EU electricity in 2025, according to industry group WindEurope. Yet the region currently operates only about 37 GW of offshore wind across 13 countries, meaning the planned 100 GW expansion would profoundly reshape Europe’s power market.

Investor enthusiasm for clean energy globally has waned in recent years due to rising capital costs, supply‑chain constraints and unease over China’s dominant position in renewables manufacturing. Trump’s explicit hostility toward green energy - especially wind power - further dented sentiment as the U.S. government scrapped numerous projects this past year.

Meanwhile, Europe’s cost‑of‑living crisis, which has been intensified by high energy prices, has turned climate policies into political flashpoints, fuelling resistance to net‑zero plans.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE

Cost concerns were clearly as much a driver of the European offshore wind pact as worries about overreliance on the U.S.

The new plan thus contains several elements that could reduce development costs and ultimately lower consumer electricity prices.

The most important of these is the scale of the commitment, which can help trim costs by providing the offshore wind supply chain with greater demand certainty. This, in turn, should encourage investment in homegrown manufacturing.

WindEurope says industry players have pledged to cut costs by 30% between 2025 and 2040, predicting the plan will create 91,000 jobs and generate 1 trillion euros ($1.19 trillion) in economic activity.

A key feature of the agreement is its blueprint for connecting wind farms to multiple countries through a network of bidirectional cables and interconnectors. This should allow power to flow where it is needed most, improving efficiency by giving operators flexibility to respond to changing supply‑and‑demand patterns across several markets.

Such cross‑border “arbitrage” should also help reduce episodes of “negative pricing” – periods when excess wind power forces operators to curtail output and governments to compensate them.

""When it is windy in Germany, it may not be windy in the UK, so if Germany can't use all of the power, the UK can take some instead of wasting it,"" said Jordan May, senior analyst at consultancy TGS 4C.

What’s more, the multi-nation plan will cover multiple time zones, meaning countries will peak at different hours. This should make it easier to match supply with demand, potentially reducing the need for gas‑fired power, May added.

Finally, Europe may gain from Trump’s antipathy toward wind. The U.S. sector has experienced a dramatic downturn under this administration. The International Energy Agency last year cut its 2030 U.S. offshore wind forecast by more than 50%. Reduced American demand for vessels, components and engineering services could ultimately lead to lower prices for European operators.

Still, unlocking these efficiency gains will require European governments to develop complex new regulations to align different national subsidy regimes and power market rules. That process could take years and face political resistance in some countries.

UNPREDICTABLE COSTS

The cost of switching to renewables has become a point of contention in Europe. But these costs are highly uncertain, as forecasting in this area is hardly a science, whether one is looking at fossil fuels or green energy.

Offshore wind demands heavy upfront investment but tends to have lower long‑term operating costs. Gas‑fired plants, on the other hand, are cheaper to build but are also exposed to volatile global gas prices.

Moreover, debates about the cost of renewables often fail to consider the cost of doing nothing, which is enormous. Europe’s power demand is expected to nearly double by mid‑century, meaning the region will need to upgrade and expand its aging transmission and distribution grids regardless of which technology dominates. The longer European leaders wait, the more expensive this is likely to be.

Europe’s joint offshore wind plan offers a pathway to building more homegrown power and industrial capacity while reducing reliance on foreign fossil fuels. While that’s important, its ultimate success will depend on whether it lowers electricity costs for European consumers.

SINGAPORE, Jan. 27, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Singapore Air Show -- Radia, the developer of the WindRunner™ aircraft, is advancing a new approach to commercial air cargo with a purpose-built platform designed to move extremely large payloads more directly and with fewer infrastructure constraints. Radia will highlight WindRunner at the Singapore Air Show, booth #C-W103.

As global supply chains increasingly depend on outsized, high-value systems, existing air cargo solutions are reaching their limits. Cargo often exceeds spatial constraints long before weight becomes an issue, forcing disassembly, multimodal transport, and reliance on ports, roads, and specialized infrastructure.

WindRunner overcomes these limitations by enabling airlift for cargo previously considered too large to fly. Payloads range from large aerostructures, including complete widebody fuselage sections, to the largest jet engines ever built, oversized power transformers up to 70 tonnes, ultra-long wind turbine blades exceeding 100 meters, and next-generation space hardware such as large rockets, satellites, and launch systems.

By prioritizing volume over weight, WindRunner provides more than 6,800 cubic meters of usable cargo space (10x bigger than 777 volume) and supports roll-on, roll-off transport of fully assembled cargo using standard ground equipment. The aircraft is designed to operate from semi-prepared or unpaved runways as short as 1,800 meters, extending commercial airlift access to locations where traditional infrastructure is limited or unavailable.

""Commercial cargo requirements have outgrown the logistics systems built to support them,"" said Mark Lundstrom, Founder and CEO of Radia. ""WindRunner expands what is possible for air cargo operators by removing long-standing constraints on size, access, and complexity. This is what is needed for existing industry, and it will also unlock many additional huge products that are currently constrained by transportation limitations.""

Designed for Real-World Commercial Operations

WindRunner is being developed under a civil certification pathway using proven, certified components to support reliable and repeatable operations at scale. Radia plans to operate WindRunner through a transport-as-a-service model, providing flexible capacity to commercial operators, governments, and humanitarian organizations rather than selling aircraft.

The platform supports a wide range of missions, including project and industrial cargo, aerospace and space systems transport, energy infrastructure components, humanitarian relief, and logistics into remote or infrastructure-constrained regions.

Working with the Global Cargo Ecosystem

Radia is collaborating with established cargo operators to ensure WindRunner integrates seamlessly into existing commercial workflows. In 2025, Radia announced a collaboration with Maximus Air to explore WindRunner's potential to expand access and efficiency for outsized air cargo missions.

By working directly with experienced operators, Radia is aligning WindRunner's design and operations with real-world requirements.

Expanding Access and Reducing Complexity

WindRunner enables more direct point-to-point delivery while reducing handling steps, infrastructure dependence, and overall project complexity. Its infrastructure-light approach also supports sustainability objectives by minimizing multi-leg transport and enabling compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

WindRunner is currently progressing through detailed design and supplier integration, with first flight targeted by the end of the decade.

About Radia

Radia is a dual-use aerospace company developing WindRunner™, the world's largest aircraft by volume. WindRunner is designed to enable direct transport of oversized cargo across commercial, energy, defense, aerospace, and humanitarian missions without reliance on specialized infrastructure. Radia is headquartered in Boulder, Colorado and Rome, Italy, with a growing global partner and supplier network.

How do you see Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels fitting into the broader regional energy transition strategy?
Combined with the great potential to produce low-cost clean fuels, this makes the region a natural hub for the production and distribution of clean maritime and aviation fuels.

How do you see Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels fitting into the broader regional energy transition strategy?

We see several elements aligning from a regional and techno-economic perspective. The Gulf countries are major global transport hubs for the maritime and aviation industry, and that involves a lot of fuels. Combined with the great potential to produce low-cost clean fuels, this makes the region a natural hub for the production and distribution of clean maritime and aviation fuels. And Gulf actors are also major investors in clean fuel projects in the Mediterranean area, often in alliances with EU investors and technology providers. The close proximity to Europe is a major factor in Europe’s interest in close cooperation with the Mediterranean and Guld countries.

Hydrogen is central to both the energy transition and the production of eFuels. From Dii’s perspective, what policy and infrastructure priorities are needed to accelerate green hydrogen production for aviation (and beyond) across the MENA region?

At an early stage, supporting policies play an important role in shaping markets. Dii always advocates for TLC policies, i.e. policies that are transparent, long-lasting and certain. Our industry partners have invested heavily in clean fuel projects over the years and stand ready to invest. But they can only do that when the rules of the game are clearly set and there is certainty they won’t change on a whim.

Another important pre-requisite is enabling infrastructure, i.e. ports, pipelines, water supply, grids, storage facilities etc. They often require long lead times and involve several partners, especially in the case of common user infrastructure. More urgency is required for enabling infrastructure.

Given Dii’s advocacy for regulatory alignment and energy diplomacy, what steps are needed to harmonise standards between the EU, GCC, and North Africa to unlock cross-border trade in clean aviation fuels?

Several elements such as harmonized standards, carbon pricing, globally recognised certificates, a common finance framework and infrastructure development are crucial to shape markets for clean fuels. Ideally, the world quickly unities around common agreements, but the reality is that global consensus around carbon pricing mechanisms or harmonization around standards and certificates requires time and, in some cases, may not materialize at all. We would therefor advocate for regional alliances around certain topics, for example the development of clean aviation and maritime corridors that connect regions that can align on standards and carbon pricing.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/69778e06973d360ce6862fe0/1769513126762/2.png?format=1500w,N,,2026-01-27 11:10:10.316752

While conventional Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers a vital near-term bridge as a drop-in hydrocarbon, the industry’s long-term net-zero ambitions demand a fuel that is not only carbon-free but also scalable, cost-competitive, and independent of biomass constraints.

For the sun-rich nations of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), the future of clean flying is written not only in the skies, but also on the ground through renewable energy and hydrogen. Liquid Green Hydrogen (LGH), produced from water using vast solar energy, represents a paradigm shift—a truly sustainable aviation fuel whose scalability is limited only by sunlight and engineering ambition. With its world-leading solar resources, existing aviation hub status, and forward-looking industrial strategy, the UAE is uniquely positioned to pilot this integrated value chain—from gigawatt-scale solar plants to cryogenic fuel loading at airport gates.

Two major issues challenge our vision of hydrogen-powered aviation: compared to conventional jet fuel and jet engines, liquid hydrogen has a low volumetric energy density, and aviation fuel cells have a low specific power. However, these are not dead ends, but rather engineering challenges with clear innovation roadmaps. The response is taking shape through parallel revolutions in airframe design and propulsion technology.

The low volumetric energy density of liquid hydrogen means that aircraft need significantly larger fuel tanks, while also the fuel economy needs to improve. The industry’s most promising answer is the Blended Wing Body (BWB) design, actively pursued by major manufacturers and ambitious start-ups. This fundamental redesign transforms a volumetric challenge into an opportunity for greater efficiency. By merging the fuselage and wings into a single, wide lifting body, the BWB creates a much larger internal volume for cryogenic hydrogen tanks while improving the aircraft aerodynamics. The BWB design can improve overall fuel economy by up to 20%, partially offsetting hydrogen's inherent range penalty.

While hydrogen can be combusted in modified gas turbines-a more straightforward transition-the greater long-term efficiency prize lies in hydrogen fuel cells with electric propulsion. The challenge, as noted, is specific power. Today’s aviation-grade fuel cell systems are too heavy for mainstream commercial flight. Yet, the industry roadmap is aggressive and focused. Research is targeting High-Temperature PEM fuel cells (HT-PEMFC) with simpler thermal and water management, enabling a lighter design. The goal is to achieve a system-level specific power exceeding 3 kW/kg by 2035, a key threshold for making regional aircraft commercially viable. For longer ranges, hybrid propulsion architectures—such as integrating fuel cells with hydrogen gas turbines—are under investigation. These systems aim to exploit the high efficiency of fuel cells during cruise while using turbines to support high-power phases.

These parallel advancements represent the most promising pathway to closing the performance gap. If these technological and infrastructure challenges are met, hydrogen-powered flights over distances of 5,000+ km could become a commercial reality by the 2040s. This technological pathway represents a strategic investment in the future of sustainable aviation—a future where energy security and climate leadership are intertwined. In the UAE, LGH will become more cost efficient than SAF from biomass by 2050 and cheaper than conventional jet fuel by 2060.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/69724bfb0374c60bbe7a93c3/1769505712790/From+Solar+to+Wings.png?format=1500w,N,,2026-01-27 11:10:13.515655

Troy Carter) introduced legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives to restore the SAF premium credit, referred to as the ‘Securing American’s Fuels (SAF) Act’.","Clean energy advocates cite the role of policy and incentives as a necessity to advance the current energy transition and the decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors (such as aviation). The reasoning is straightforward: nascent technologies often require a temporary policy boost to grow and reach economies of scale before they can compete with incumbent technology. Be it solar or wind or EVs or biofuels – all of these technologies have benefited from tax credits and have become more cost-competitive over time so they can stand on their own. While ‘free market proponents’ may sometimes decry this as an unfair support of renewables, fossil fuels are also subsidized by taxpayers in the U.S.[1] – energy (like food and feed) is understood to be a critical societal need and is considered worthy of taxpayer support.

Historically, policy support for biofuels in the United States has come in the form of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which has led directly to a boom in ethanol production from corn, and an increase in the use of biodiesel and renewable diesel from seed oils. These fuels have become an integral part of the transportation fuel network in the U.S. and have resulted in added co-benefits to the agricultural sector, particularly corn and soybeans. There are also valid criticisms of the impacts of these credits from an environmental and economic perspective, but these credits have allowed the U.S. biofuels industry to mature in the decades since they were introduced.

Along these lines, ambitious policy support was announced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Section 45Z, Clean Fuel Production Credit (CFPC).[2] This credit incentivized production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by offering a $1.75 per-gallon incentive along with $1 per-gallon for other transportation biofuels (for pathways with carbon intensity was lower than 50 kg CO2e/mmBTU). This was bipartisan legislation that resulted in several large project announcements in the U.S., and a shot in the arm towards meeting the SAF Grand Challenge.[3] In 2024, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) suggested that SAF production could increase from 2,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 30,000 bpd if all announced capacity additions came online.[4] While SAF volumes are still relatively low in comparison to total jet fuel consumption in the U.S. (less than 2%), strong growth was predicted in the Other Biofuels category within which the EIA includes SAF.[5]

However, passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in 2025 resulted in decidedly mixed outcomes for biofuels growth in the near future. While credits for other transportation biofuels were retained at $1 per-gallon and the timeline for claiming these credits was extended from 2027 to 2029, the exclusive bonus for SAF was reduced to attain parity with other biofuels, at $1 per-gallon; this represents a 43% reduction in the SAF 45Z credit going from one legislation to the other, over a period of three years between policy, creating understandable uncertainty for project developers.

Our research shows that changes from the IRA to the OBBBA result in a slight reduction in the internal rate of return (IRR, %) for projects that produce SAF (and other biofuels) from agricultural residues and claim the 45Z tax credit. Our analysis considered SAF production using the pyrolysis and Fischer-Tropsch pathways. When feedstock-dependent inputs were held the same, IRA-era IRR was consistently greater than that under the OBBBA. Under the simulation conditions employed in our analysis, the decrease was limited to ~2% points. Though our preliminary research does not conclusively answer questions about SAF profitability under evolving policy scenarios at present, our models can illustrate to policymakers the financial impacts of changes to incentive structures. While SAF tax credits were originally conceived under the 45Z legislation as technology-neutral support to decarbonize aviation, changes to this structure under the OBBBA diminish this effort. This fact is not lost on policymakers—recently, a bipartisan group of policymakers (including Louisiana Rep. Troy Carter) introduced legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives to restore the SAF premium credit, referred to as the ‘Securing American’s Fuels (SAF) Act’.[6] The group cites emissions reduction in the transportation sector, while increasing demand for U.S. agricultural products as the basis for strengthening the American SAF industry.

Considering that our analysis was performed using technoeconomic simulations sourced from the literature, we welcome the opportunity to replicate this research using real-world data from active and announced projects. We also look forward to working with policymakers interested in independent, trusted assessments of potential policy legislation. The LSU Center for Energy Studies (CES) was established by the Louisiana Legislature in 1982 to serve as a resource for policymakers, industry leaders, and community members, to deliver timely insights on energy trends and policies which impact the state.[7] The newly-created LSU Energy Institute unifies and expands several longstanding programs under an integrated platform for applied research and analysis, and brings CES into this fold.[8] We encourage interest parties to get in touch with us.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/69779444f774870965396413/1769505912478/6.png?format=1500w,N,,2026-01-27 11:10:21.711688

What was long-term ambition is now translating into tangible project pipelines, policy signals, and cross-sector alignment that place the UAE firmly on the global SAF map.

Most notably, UAE is launching 13 new SAF projects as part of a national strategy to achieve 700 million litres of annual production and a 1% voluntary SAF blend by 2031. Taken together, these initiatives signal a clear shift: SAF is no longer a peripheral decarbonisation pathway in the region. It is becoming a strategic pillar of the national aviation and energy transition.

Why the UAE Is Uniquely Positioned to Scale SAF

The UAE’s advantage lies in the intersection of three critical factors: demand, infrastructure, and energy. As a global aviation hub, the country hosts some of the world’s busiest long-haul routes and largest international carriers. This concentration of aviation activity creates sustained, long-term demand for jet fuel, and increasingly for lower-carbon alternatives.

At the same time, the UAE’s energy system provides a strong foundation for SAF and Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels. Abundant solar resources, competitive renewable power costs, and an existing industrial base make hydrogen-derived fuels increasingly viable. When combined with advanced refining capabilities, ports, storage, and logistics infrastructure, the region is well placed to support multiple SAF pathways: from HEFA and co-processing through to eSAF.

From Announcements to an Emerging Project Pipeline

The announcement of the 13 SAF projects is particularly significant. The projects are expected to span different technologies and feedstocks, indicating that the UAE is not betting on a single solution, but rather building a clearly diversified SAF ecosystem. This mirrors how other major energy transitions have successfully scaled. Through parallel experimentation, competition, and collaboration across sectors.

Crucially, these projects are being developed alongside broader national strategies on hydrogen, industrial decarbonisation, and energy diversification. SAF is not being treated exclusively as an aviation issue, but as part of a wider economic and industrial opportunity which can attract investment, develop local expertise, and support export-oriented markets.

Policy, Infrastructure, and the Speed of Scale

While momentum is clear, the next phase will determine how quickly projects move from announcement to execution. Policy certainty remains central - and crucially, is being developed. Investors and developers consistently emphasise the need for long-term clarity around sustainability criteria, lifecycle accounting, incentives, and market access. Clear, stable frameworks are essential to unlock financing and enable offtake agreements—particularly for capital-intensive facilities.

Infrastructure is the other critical enabler. SAF production cannot happen in isolation: it relies on hydrogen supply, renewable power, water availability, CO₂ sourcing, storage, blending facilities, and export or distribution routes. Coordinating these elements across multiple stakeholders requires early planning and alignment.

The UAE’s track record in delivering large-scale infrastructure quickly is a significant advantage, but timelines remain tight. Aligning aviation decarbonisation goals with infrastructure development cycles will be one of the defining challenges of the next five years.

A Regional Hub With Global Implications

With Europe advancing mandates and the aviation sector facing mounting pressure, demand for SAF will begin to outstrip supply in many regions. The UAE’s geographic position creates the potential for it to become a central hub in future SAF trade flows.

This raises questions on how sustainability standards align across regions, how certificates are recognised, how carbon accounting works for international fuel movements, and how cross-border offtake agreements are structured.

These are just some of the commercial questions that airlines, fuel producers, investors, and governments must grapple with today.

Why SAF MENA Is the Place to Engage

As the UAE’s SAF ecosystem moves from ambition to implementation, industry stakeholders align on these points.

The Sustainable Aviation Futures MENA Congress, taking place 10–12 February 2026 in Dubai, is designed for this alignment.

Bringing together government leaders, airlines, fuel producers, energy companies, investors, EPCs, and technology providers, SAF MENA focuses on the practical realities of scaling SAF, LCAF, and sFuels in the region.

With the UAE’s SAF announcements marking a clear inflection point, the Congress offers an opportunity to understand what is happening now, influence what comes next, and connect with partners driving projects forward.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/69778eea2034ec3e0b8cbdb8/1769507584750/1.png?format=1500w,N,,2026-01-27 11:10:18.266217

At the invitation of the Hon’ble Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas of India, H.E. Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, the Hon’ble Minister of Energy and Natural Resources of Canada, H.E. Timothy Hodgson, participated in India Energy Week 2026 (IEW’26) in Goa, marking the first high-level participation of a Canadian Cabinet Minister at IEW. On the sidelines of the event, the two Ministers held a bilateral meeting and launched the renewed Canada-India Ministerial Energy Dialogue. During this meeting, the Ministers affirmed the immense importance that energy security and diversity of supply, has in the safety, wellbeing, and economic vitality of both countries.

This meeting is a follow up to the direction provided by the Prime Minister(s) of India and Canada during their interaction on the sidelines of the G7 Summit, held in June 2025 in Kananaskis, Canada, wherein both leaders underscored the importance of restarting senior ministerial, as well as working-level engagements.

Natural Resources Canada and India’s Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas recognized the complementary nature of their energy sectors, and the mutual value to be gained on sustained engagement on energy matters. Canada has stated its goal of becoming an energy superpower in clean and conventional energy, with export diversification as a priority while India, as the epicenter of global energy landscape, offers a natural and symbiotic partnership grounded in scale, stability, and long-term opportunity. Canada has current and emerging liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, is increasing production and exports of crude oil to markets in Asia via the Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX) Pipeline and is advancing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) exports to Asia via the west coast of Canada. At the same time, India being the world’s third largest oil consumer, fourth largest LNG importer, third largest LPG consumer, and having fourth largest refining capacity, is projected to remain at the center of the global energy landscape, accounting for over one-third of the growth in global energy demand over the next two decades, largest contribution by any country. Even efforts are underway in India to substantially scale up domestic oil production, significantly expand refining capacity, increase use of natural gas in the energy mix. Thus, India and Canada have significant potential to emerge strong collaborators in area of energy fuels. In this context, the Ministers affirm to deepen bilateral energy trade including supply of Canadian LNG, LPG, and crude oil to India, and supply of refined petroleum products from India to Canada.

The Ministers recognize the importance of joint commercial and investment partnerships in each other’s energy sector. Canada is acting quickly to build energy projects and supply products to international markets, with Asia as a priority region. In 2025, the Government of Canada launched the Major Projects Office and announced the acceleration of several energy and resource projects and strategies, representing more than $116 billion in investments. India is also investing heavily in its own energy supply and prosperity. India highlighted the various policy reforms undertaken, including the huge investment opportunity of US$ 500 billion in overall value chain of energy sector. Recognizing this, the Ministers agreed to deepen long-term partnerships aimed at facilitating increased reciprocal investment in the Canadian and Indian energy sectors.

The Ministers also recognized the importance of climate-related objectives. This includes efforts to reduce emissions in conventional energy value chains, including through carbon capture utilization and storage, and support for the development and deployment of cleaner technologies as energy demand grows. Recognizing that there exists a huge potential for cooperation in clean energy value chains, the Ministers noted the opportunities for collaboration in renewable energy, including hydrogen, biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel; battery storage; critical minerals; clean technologies; electricity systems; energy supply chain resilience, and the application of artificial intelligence in the energy sector.

The Ministers noted the ongoing collaborative efforts to advance the global energy transition via the global development and deployment of biofuels through Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA), where Canada is an observer.

Credit FAQ: What Does The UAE's Stablecoin Regulation Mean For Local Banks?

Stablecoin adoption and tokenization are expected to accelerate globally in 2026, driven by supportive regulation, notably in the US. The United Arab Emirates is contributing to this movement with its Payment Token Services Regulation, which governs the issuance, conversion, custody and transfer of stablecoins within the country.

Since the regulation became effective in August 2024, several dirham-backed stablecoins have or are expected to be launched, indicating growing adoption and integration into the national payment system. S&P Global Ratings views the regulation as more enabling than disruptive for banks, allowing them to participate in stablecoin innovation while managing potential funding risks.

Scientists say that the world is unprepared for rise in heat

A new study explores different global warming scenarios and compares them to current data on temperatures considered uncomfortable. The result is alarming, with nearly 3.8 billion people projected to face extreme heat by 2050. That is, if global temperatures rise by 2°C. The research mentions that as heatwaves become stronger, the health risks, from dizziness to organ failure and death, increase. It argues that cooling infrastructure must expand rapidly for people to adapt. “New infrastructure, such as sustainable air conditioning or passive cooling, needs to be built out within the next few years to ensure people can cope with dangerous heat.” What is more interesting is that the cooler regions from Canada to Russia can be affected as well and will have to adapt as the heat rises.

These steps are being discussed through joint councils involving both government and industry, including the Public-Private Council for the Promotion of Sustainable Aviation Fuel.
By helping airlines afford this fuel and encouraging its use at airports, Japan aims to take a leading role in cleaner aviation in Asia.","The Japanese government is working on a plan to subsidise sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for domestic airlines, as part of broader efforts to cut carbon emissions from air travel and promote cleaner flights, reports Travel And Tour World.

Under the proposed plan, fuel suppliers may be required to offer aviation fuel blended with sustainable alternatives at airports across Japan. The policy is being developed through official government councils and is expected to be completed by the 2026 financial year. It will be supported by changes to the Airport Law and other related rules.

Japan’s push for cleaner aviation fuel is based on government targets and policy discussions aimed at reducing emissions from the air transport sector. These include a goal of blending 10% sustainable aviation fuel into jet fuel by 2030, along with measures to encourage fuel production and investment in supply systems. These goals are outlined in official planning documents and policy proposals from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.

According to government sources, the developing framework could include financial support to help airlines manage the higher cost of sustainable fuel. It may also require fuel suppliers to mix sustainable fuel into the aviation fuel sold at Japanese airports. In addition, the government is looking to expand the collection of raw materials, such as used cooking oil, by working with local governments and industry partners.

These steps are being discussed through joint councils involving both government and industry, including the Public-Private Council for the Promotion of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The councils form part of official policy discussions focused on increasing fuel supply and setting clear regulatory goals.

For passengers, the main benefit of the policy would be cleaner flights with lower carbon emissions. Using sustainable aviation fuel allows airlines to cut emissions without affecting aircraft performance. By helping airlines afford this fuel and encouraging its use at airports, Japan aims to take a leading role in cleaner aviation in Asia.

The move could also make Japan more appealing to travellers who value environmentally friendly travel options, especially those who consider carbon impact when choosing airlines and flights.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-1.png,N,,2026-01-27 03:57:46.504809

Explanatory statements published by Congress regarding the legislation included guidance on small refinery exemptions (SREs) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The House and Senate Appropriations Committee on Jan. 5 released the legislative package, which includes three bicameral, bipartisan fiscal year appropriations bills. The three bills include fiscal year 2026 appropriations for Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies; Energy and Water Development; and Interior, Environment and Related Agencies.

The U.S. House of Representatives on Jan. 8 voted 397 to 28 in favor of the appropriations package, H.R.6938. The U.S. Senate voted 82 to 15 to pass the legislation on Jan. 15. Trump signed the bill into law on Jan. 23.

H.R. 6938 includes language on policies related to biomass energy. Specifically, Section 429 of the bill directs the U.S. Department of Energy, the USDA, and the U.S. EPA to jointly ensure that federal policy relating to biomass energy is consistent across all federal departments and agencies and recognizes the full benefits of the use of forest biomass for energy, conservation and responsible forest management. The agencies are also directed to establish clear and simple policies for the use of forest biomass as an energy solution, including policies that reflect the carbon neutrality of forest bioenergy and recognize biomass as a renewable energy source, provided the use of forest biomass for energy production does not cause conversion of forests to non-forest use. Biomass policies are also expected to encourage provide investment throughout the biomass supply chain, including forest bioenergy production.

The Senate Appropriations Committee on Jan. 5 released an explanatory statement that accompanies the EPA appropriations bill. The report does not carry the force of law. Rather, it includes guidance on congressional intent regarding a variety of matters, including those related to the RFS and small refinery exemption (SRE) program.

Regarding the SRE program, the explanatory statement stresses that the EPA may exempt small refineries from compliance with the RFS in certain circumstances, and that small refineries “may at any time petition the Administrator for an extension of the exemption for the reason of disproportionate economic hardship.” The statement also directs EPA to develop policies and procedures for making SRE decisions consistent with a report published by the Government Accountability Office in November 2022.

That GAO report, titled ""Renewable Fuel Standard: Actions Needed to Improve Decision-Making in the Small Refinery Exemption Program,” was slammed as shoddy and obsolete by representatives of the U.S. biofuel industry.

Within the report, the GOA made seven specific recommendations. First, the agency recommended that the EPA reassess its conclusion that small refineries recover their RFS compliance costs in the price of gasoline and diesel they sell. Second, the GAO recommended the DOE develop an approach for consulting on SREs that provides EPA with useful information on disproportionate economic hardship. In addition, the GAO said the EPA should identify and communicate what refineries would need to submit to demonstrate disproportionate economic hardship; develop policies and procedures for making SRE decisions; develop policies and procedures to ensure the agency meets statutory deadlines; and assess the effect of SRE decision timing on the benefit provided to small refineries, as well as the effect on fuel markets, and reconsider petition requirements. The report also encouraged the DOE to develop policies and procedures for its consultation with EPA on SRE petitions.

The explanatory statement also directs the EPA to provide a briefing within 60 days on its proposed actions related to eRINs within the RFS program. In addition, the agency is directed to submit a report to lawmakers within 30 days that is focused on fuel derived from waste plastic or waste tires, including any plans the EPA may have to qualify such fuels as cellulosic biofuel under the RFS.

A separate explanatory statement released on Jan. 5 in conjunction with the portion of the legislative package providing fiscal year 2026 funding for the U.S. Department of Energy notes up to $5 million can be made available to continue supporting the development of new domestically manufactured, low-emission, high-efficiency resident wood heaters.

Lawmakers also specify that the appropriations funding agreement provides up to $5 million to support research and development aimed as advancing the supply of renewable natural gas (RNG), clean hydrogen, and other impactful products form syngas; up to $25 million for algae-related activities; and up to $10 million for research and development of the anaerobic bioproduction of 3-hydroxypropionic acid utilizing existing Midwest ethanol fermentation infrastructure and renewable whole-kernel corn feedstock.

Within the statement, lawmakers also encourage the DOE “to conduct research related to the development, pre-piloting, piloting, and demonstration scale-up of renewable liquefied petroleum gas or alternative fuels production, in parallel with the department’s focus on the scale-up of sustainable aviation fuel technologies.” In addition, the DOE is “encouraged to pursue the advancement and development of pre-commercial, advanced sustainable aviation fuel feedstocks and technologies to include non-biogenic feedstocks and technologies, such as hydrogen-based e-fuels.”

Recognizing the promise of the prototype motor, first presented in 2022, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, Airbus, began collaborative research in 2024 to further develop and scale this technology. The joint signing of the partnership agreement at Japan International Aerospace Expo 2024 underlining both companies' determination to promote aerospace innovation. Building on over 50 years of experience in superconducting technology, this partnership brings together Toshiba's and Airbus's innovations in hydrogen propulsion and aircraft electrification programs and marks a pivotal step toward realizing zero-emission flight.

Hydrogen-powered aircraft are set to transform air travel by replacing fossil fuels with clean energy solutions. Hydrogen can power aircraft in two ways: burning it in turbines or converting it to electricity in fuel cells. The second way is much more efficient, as it allows electric propulsion with zero CO₂ emissions. Toshiba's superconducting motor amplifies this advantage by operating at cryogenic temperatures and, therefore, no electrical resistance, maximizing energy efficiency. Liquefied hydrogen stored at -253°C environment serves as both fuel and coolant, creating a perfect synergy that improves performance while reducing weight and paving the way for sustainable aviation.

Beyond aviation, Toshiba envisions superconducting motor technology as a powerful engine for sustainable mobility in various applications. Its lightweight, high-output design and cryogenic efficiency make it ideal for large-scale applications where weight and energy performance are critical. Potential future uses include powering next-generation ships for clean maritime transport and propulsion for space travel.

Toshiba and Airbus have taken a revolutionary path toward carbon-neutral skies, reshaping aviation with superconducting motors and hydrogen-powered propulsion systems. This collaboration goes beyond engineering; it embodies a vision of mobility free from carbon emissions while breaking through new efficiency frontiers. By pairing superconductivity with hydrogen's potential as a clean energy source, the partnership is shaping a future where aircraft fly farther, cleaner, and smarter.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/prnewswire_sg_868/b4a5c6a465358a1df48f2edc453c222d,N,,2026-01-26 22:57:21.863778

“The Johor plant is a major step forward for EcoCeres’ regional platform and for Malaysia’s renewable fuel industry,” said Matti Lievonen, CEO of EcoCeres.
“It also demonstrates our commitment to reliable supply capability and high product quality as customers’ demand for renewable fuel solutions accelerates.
According to the SAF 2050 Outlook report, all the ASEAN countries examined could potentially have sufficient capacity to position themselves as net SAF exporters.
In addition to exporting SAF, ASEAN is predicted to become a significant market for SAF in its own right.","EcoCeres has officially launched its renewable fuel facility in Pasir Gudang, Johor, Malaysia, which the company says is the country’s first sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production plant. Commissioning and start-up of the plant were successfully achieved in October 2025. The facility also produces hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and renewable naphtha, with a combined maximum production capacity of 420,000 tonnes per year.

Dr. Peter Lee, Chairman of Towngas and Principal of Full Vision Capital, said: “EcoCeres has grown from a laboratory in Hong Kong into one of the world’s leading producers of SAF, and this new Johor plant shows how regional commitment to sustainability can feed into the global search for climate solutions. With supportive government policies and the dedication of all our partners, we can turn the tide on climate change for future generations.”

EcoCeres has developed its own proprietary waste to fuel processes in Hong Kong and successfully scaled them through its first facility in Zhangjiagang, China, which has helped the company become one of the world’s leading SAF producers by volume. “The Johor plant is a major step forward for EcoCeres’ regional platform and for Malaysia’s renewable fuel industry,” said Matti Lievonen, CEO of EcoCeres. “It also demonstrates our commitment to reliable supply capability and high product quality as customers’ demand for renewable fuel solutions accelerates. This facility supports Malaysia’s transition towards net-zero while strengthening Hong Kong’s strategic position as a regional hub for financing and scaling sustainable energy projects, enabling the supply of sustainable fuels to global industries. Our waste-to-fuel technology proves that economic growth and environmental stewardship can go hand-in-hand.”

In addition to the Malaysian facility, EcoCeres’ Zhangjiagang plant also produces SAF and HVO bringing its combined maximum global renewable fuels capacity to approximately 770,000 tonnes per year and further enhancing Hong Kong’s role as the headquarters of an integrated regional renewable fuels platform.

ASEAN could produce 8.5 million barrels of SAF daily by 2050

With the pressing need to decarbonise aviation, ASEAN economies could generate as much as 8.5 million barrels per day of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2050, according to the ASEAN SAF 2050 Outlook report.

Download the report here.

The report provides a regional supply chain assessment for 2030, 2040, and 2050, examining potential SAF demand and supply scenarios across Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam, as well as import markets including Japan, Singapore, and the Republic of Korea (ROK).

The report was developed by GHD through financial support provided by Global Affairs Canada from the Canadian Trade and Investment Facility for Development (CTIF) implemented by Cowater International (Cowater) in association with the Institute of Public Administrators of Canada (IPAC) and Global Affairs Canada, with Boeing as the knowledge partner, and supporting the ASEAN Secretariat.

According to the SAF 2050 Outlook report, all the ASEAN countries examined could potentially have sufficient capacity to position themselves as net SAF exporters. Viet Nam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand have the most abundant feedstock to support SAF production, while Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, may have the most cost-efficient distribution for markets in Japan, Singapore and ROK.

In addition to exporting SAF, ASEAN is predicted to become a significant market for SAF in its own right. The report projects that SAF demand in ASEAN will grow sharply from 15,000 barrels per day in 2030, to over 700,000 barrels per day by 2050. The largest SAF demands are expected to come from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, as well as other Asian economies such as Japan and ROK.

The report also examined different ways of producing SAF. Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) is the most prevalent technology for producing SAF today, costing about twice as much as jet fuel, with the largest cost contributor being feedstock. Alternative Gasification/Fisher-Tropsch (Gasification + FT), and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) pathways could be 4-7 times more expensive, but this gap is expected to reduce as technologies mature and scale up.

Deputy Secretary-General for the ASEAN Economic Community, Satvinder Singh, said, “The ASEAN SAF 2050 Outlook confirms our region’s strong comparative advantage on the supply side, particularly in the availability of sustainable bio-feedstocks. At the same time, rising regional and global demand for sustainable aviation fuel presents a clear market opportunity for ASEAN. To fully capitalise on both demand and supply dynamics, ASEAN Member States should work together to scale up production capacity, deploy cost-effective technologies, and establish robust regional trade and market frameworks. By efficiently matching our abundant agricultural resources with growing SAF demand, ASEAN can position itself not only as a self-sufficient and competitive sustainable aviation hub, but also as a reliable energy supplier supporting the decarbonisation of the broader Asia-Pacific aviation and energy markets.”",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0134.JPG-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-26 21:56:37.048981

Ultimately, Ned recognized that integration success had less to do with aligning systems and more with helping people feel respected, included and confident about their future.
Key insight: Employees commit to leaders who protect dignity and identity, and foster belonging.","Nearly a decade into his career at a fast-growing tech consulting firm, Ned had earned a reputation for discipline and strategic clarity, rising quickly by building the company’s highest-performing division. That success helped put the firm on a larger company’s radar and ultimately led to an acquisition. When the deal closed, Ned thought the toughest work was behind him. But as part of the acquisition, he was offered a generous retention bonus and asked to stay on to lead the integration of the two organizations. On paper, it looked like a straightforward assignment. In reality, it became the defining leadership test of the acquisition and of Ned’s career, revealing how quickly morale can erode when uncertainty and connection go unaddressed.

It began slowly, surfacing a week or so after the acquisition was announced. Employees, emerging from a fog of shock that the organization they grew to love was changing, peppered Ned with questions about what it all meant for their careers. Often, his answers felt inadequate, and Ned struggled to calm the growing angst on the team. In truth, many details of the integration were still in flux, and he didn’t have the information employees were seeking. He worried that telling them so would make things worse, so he avoided such conversations. Eventually, two of his most talented people accepted job offers from competitors. That was a wakeup call.

Key leadership shifts to make

The Seismic Shift in You, a new book by Dr. Michelle Johnston and Dr. Marshall Goldsmith, reinforces an important reality. Leaders who develop deep self-knowledge and strive to put others first are far better equipped to help their teams navigate disruption. The book examines seven important shifts in your leadership thinking and behavior and argues that leadership effectiveness begins with developing a strong internal connection, focused on understanding your priorities, reactions, blind spots and impact on others. This extends to how you structure your time and how you communicate and make others feel, a crucial factor in reinforcing positive morale. Leaders who lack this grounding are more likely to over-reassure, avoid uncomfortable uncertainty or hide behind scripted messaging. In high-pressure moments like acquisitions, those behaviors erode trust and accelerate disconnection.

By their very nature, acquisitions disrupt identity, predictability and a sense of belonging. Employees begin to wonder where they fit, whether their past contributions still matter and whether leadership can be trusted to navigate the uncertainty ahead. Research on post-merger integration shows that when these questions go unanswered, morale declines quietly, engagement weakens and valued talent begins to disengage before leaders ever notice a performance problem.

The lens of Johnston and Goldsmith’s work frames this dynamic as a connection challenge rather than a change-management problem. Simply put, you cannot sustain performance unless you first sustain connection, both within yourself as a leader and with the team depending on you. This is true whether you’re navigating an acquisition or pursuing daily business goals. Leaders who remain grounded in their own values, transparent about what they know and what they don’t and put their people first, create psychological stability for their teams. Leaders who mask their own uncertainty or retreat behind formal messaging accelerate disconnection rather than quell it. More than integration plans, org charts or strategy decks, these human behaviors shape morale and impact acquisition success.

5 lessons to lead better in an acquisition

While the acquisition assignment was tougher than Ned expected, he learned five important lessons that have made him a better leader:

1. You cannot stabilize others if you are not grounded yourself.

Ned realized that his team took emotional cues from him more than from formal announcements. When he felt pressured to project a confidence he did not fully feel, uncertainty spread. As he became more self-aware, acknowledging his own concerns and centering himself in his values, his team felt steadier and more confident.

Key insight: Leadership presence starts with internal stability, not external messaging.

2. Authenticity builds more trust than certainty.

Early on, Ned tried to protect morale by sounding decisive and optimistic. Over time, employees sensed the gap between what he said and what he truly knew or believed. When he shifted to honest, grounded communication, sharing both decisions and uncertainties, trust strengthened.

Key insight: Credibility grows as honesty grows.

3. Connection is a performance lever, not a “soft” priority.

Ned initially treated morale as secondary to meeting integration milestones. He later saw that when people felt disconnected or undervalued, productivity, initiative and collaboration weakened. When he focused on nurturing relationships, listening and creating a sense of belonging, performance rebounded.

Key insight: Sustaining connection is essential to sustaining results.

4. Leaders set the emotional tone, whether they intend to or not.

Ned’s reactions to ambiguity, pressure from the acquiring company, and internal conflict shaped the emotional climate of his team. When he learned to manage his own stress more intentionally, employees felt safer taking risks, raising concerns and staying engaged.

Key insight: Emotional self-management is a leadership superpower.

5. People follow leaders who help them feel seen, valued and secure.

Ultimately, Ned recognized that integration success had less to do with aligning systems and more with helping people feel respected, included and confident about their future. When he focused on recognizing contributions, advocating for his team, reinforcing identity and openly acknowledging the value of the culture they had created together, retention and morale improved.

Key insight: Employees commit to leaders who protect dignity and identity, and foster belonging.

Ned’s experience underscores the challenge of leading in today’s complex world. Acquisitions test not only strategy and execution; they test a leader’s capacity for self-awareness, authenticity and connection. Master that inner work and you’re far more likely to sustain morale and succeed.

Although the binding term sheet provides that certain provisions are binding on the parties, it does not obligate the parties to consummate the proposed transaction.","HOUSTON, Texas and SACRAMENTO, California, Jan. 26, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq: SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”), and DevvStream Corp. (Nasdaq: DEVS) (“DevvStream”), a leading carbon management and environmental-asset monetization firm, today announced that they have agreed to a binding term sheet to combine Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (“Southern”) (together, the “Parties”) in a three-party merger.

If the Parties are able to successfully negotiate a definitive agreement, the Parties believe the combined entity will form an integrated platform of complementary assets, with the opportunity to deploy a disciplined and proprietary environmental attribute and credit generation strategy across North America and emerging markets. The binding term sheet establishes a framework for collaboration and mutual understanding among the Parties.

The proposed transaction is intended to reinforce the development of a low-carbon fuels platform designed to accelerate SAF via HEFA, e-methanol, e-methanol-to-jet fuel pathways, expand domestic production capacity, and integrate environmental-attribute monetization into a unified customer offering. As part of the evaluation and negotiation of the definitive transaction agreement, the Parties plan to explore opportunities for integrating small modular reactor (“SMR”) nuclear power with electro-sustainable aviation fuel (“eSAF”), AI data center power, and associated environmental attribute structures.

Entry into definitive transaction agreements is subject to review and approval by the Boards of Directors of the respective companies. As part of the binding term sheet, an investor has agreed to purchase shares of XCF to fund near-term operations and, critically, to complete targeted upgrades and modifications at XCF’s New Rise Reno refinery. These funds are intended to be used to:

complete required mechanical, electrical, and process upgrades,

procure catalyst, utilities, and supporting infrastructure,

finalize commissioning and reliability improvements, and

conduct certain shareholder relations activities related to the updates and modifications at XCF’s New Rise Reno refinery.

The ultimate objective of the incremental funding is to bring the New Rise Reno facility into sustained commercial production and support the ramp-up of SAF output.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF commented: “We are excited to formalize a proposed final structure with DevvStream and Southern on what we believe will be a very accretive and excellent opportunity. We believe this combination has the potential to further validate the value XCF brings to the SAF industry while increasing shareholder value and providing alternative clean fuel opportunities. If consummated, this merger has the potential to solidify our footprint in North America as the supreme SAF producer.”

The proposed rule was delivered to the OMB by the U.S. Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service on Dec.17. The OMB website indicates the agency scheduled 16 meetings with industry stakeholders in January to discuss the proposed guidance, with the final meeting held Jan. 23. Representatives of Amp Americas, WM, Fuels America, Continuum Ag, Growth Energy, NATSO/SIGMA, Aemetis Inc., Renewable Fuels Association, POET, National Grain and Feed Association, Clean Fuels Alliance America, RNG Coalition, Pivot Bio, American Soybean Association and Gevo Inc. and were among those to meet with OMB staff regarding the proposed 45Z rule.

According to information posted to the OMB website, the proposed rule was modified during the review process and is now moving forward. The OMB website estimates a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) is currently scheduled to be released for public comment in May.

The 45Z tax credit was first established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, providing a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transportation fuels. The original version of the credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

The 45Z credit was updated and extended as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed by President Trump in July 2025. Under the OBBBA updates, the “special rate” for SAF will is eliminated beginning in 2026, effectively capping the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all fuels, including SAF. The OBBBA also extended 45Z for two additional years, through the of 2029. Legislative efforts are currently underway to reinstate the “special rate” for SAF and further extend the credit.

Although the 45Z credit was created in 2023 and entered into force in 2025, Treasury and IRS have failed to release full guidance. Guidance delays have been particularly harmful to the biobased diesel industry, with domestic production down significantly in 2025 when compared to the previous year.

Treasury and the IRS in January 2025 issued a notice of intent to propose regulations addressing the clean fuel production credit. A companion notice, also issued in January 2025, included initial guidance on emissions rates under the 45Z credit, including an initial table that sets forth emissions rates for similar categories and types of fuel.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biodieselmagazine/posts/web/2015/05/omb-logo_14313847528429_14314399266097.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 19:56:30.255861

The new system does not directly produce jet fuel but converts carbon dioxide into ingredients that can be upgraded into low‑emissions jet fuel and other carbon‑based products using established industrial processes.
It offers another pathway to generate the materials needed for low‑emissions jet fuel and other carbon‑based products, particularly near large and difficult‑to‑abate sources of industrial emissions.
The next step is to build a 20‑kilowatt pilot system to further validate the technology and demonstrate how it integrates with real industrial carbon‑emission sources.
“This innovation has shown how emissions reduction could go alongside cost efficiency and better energy use,” he said.","The system combines carbon removal and conversion into a single process, reducing the energy use and complexity that limits many existing approaches. The technology is designed with real‑world industrial settings in mind.

Distinguished Professor Tianyi Ma from RMIT’s School of Science said carbon conversion had traditionally been treated as separate steps, increasing cost and slowing progress.

“Current approaches had often been inefficient and energy‑intensive,” Ma said.

“By bringing the steps of conversion together, we have been able to simplify the process and reduce unnecessary energy losses.”

The technology turns carbon dioxide from industrial exhaust gases into basic chemical building blocks that can be used to make jet fuel and other products that are currently made mostly from fossil resources.

The new system does not directly produce jet fuel but converts carbon dioxide into ingredients that can be upgraded into low‑emissions jet fuel and other carbon‑based products using established industrial processes.

A practical role in aviation’s transition

Aviation remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise. Battery‑powered aircraft are unlikely to serve long‑distance routes at scale, and demand for sustainable aviation fuel continues to exceed global supply.

Rather than replacing existing fuel technologies, the RMIT system is positioned as a complementary option. It offers another pathway to generate the materials needed for low‑emissions jet fuel and other carbon‑based products, particularly near large and difficult‑to‑abate sources of industrial emissions.

Dr Peng Li, lead author of the study, said the research focused on improving efficiency and practicality.

“Our approach has reduced the number of processing steps and lowered energy demand compared with conventional systems,” Li said.

“The RMIT system operates without the need for highly purified carbon dioxide, which is important in real industrial environments.”

The research, published in the international journal Nature Energy, outlines a complete carbon‑conversion system. Independent expert Dr Federico Dattila, from the Polytechnic University of Turin, wrote in Nature Energy that the team’s advances brought industry a step closer to low‑energy systems that can convert CO₂ in a fully integrated process.

Scaling up with industry partners

To ensure the technology can operate outside the laboratory, the team has been working on scaling it up. They have designed and completed a three‑kilowatt prototype system to test performance under industrial conditions.

The next step is to build a 20‑kilowatt pilot system to further validate the technology and demonstrate how it integrates with real industrial carbon‑emission sources.

This scale-up effort is supported by growing industry engagement. The team is partnering with Viva Energy, Hart Bioenergy, T-Power, Aqualux Energy, CO2CRC, ViPlus Dairy and CarbonNet on pilot-scale development and future deployment pathways, helping ensure the technology aligns with emissions reduction goals and existing industrial infrastructure.

Ma said collaboration was essential to moving from research to impact.

“Scaling up has to happen hand in hand with industry,” he said.

“That is the only way to understand what would work in practice and what still needs improvement.”

The research team aims to develop a 100‑kilowatt demonstration system within the next five years and achieve commercial‑scale readiness in around six years. This timeline reflects a staged and realistic pathway for validating performance, cost and durability before wider deployment.

Hart Bioenergy’s chief executive Doug Hartmann said the technology offered both environmental and operational benefits.

“This innovation has shown how emissions reduction could go alongside cost efficiency and better energy use,” he said.

“It points to production processes that can benefit the environment without ignoring economic realities.”",https://www.rmit.edu.au/content/dam/rmit/rmit-images/news/2026/january/carbon-conversion/news-carbon-conversion-research-team-1220px.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 01:57:10.960491

Chemical manufacturing is one of the largest segments of U.S. manufacturing, yet much of the feedstock supply is derived from petroleum.
This, along with renaming to Kemvera, marks a defining moment for our company,” said Chern-Hooi Lim, founder and CEO of Kemvera.
Kemvera’s vision aligns with national priorities for domestic manufacturing, agricultural value-add, and U.S. leadership in advanced materials.","Kemvera, a sustainable chemical innovation company, today announced it has completed the process design package (FEL 1) for its planned 50,000 metric tons per year commercial-scale plant. To support scale-up for this commercial facility, Kemvera completed the design for a 500 metric tons per year pre-commercial demonstration reactor and recently commissioned its 20 metric tons per year pilot reactor and validated its robustness by demonstrating continuous operations. These key steps in process development represent significant progress toward commercialization of Kemvera’s biobased acetic acid and ethyl acetate manufacturing process.

Aligning with the company’s next phase of growth, Kemvera announces that it has been renamed from New Iridium to reflect its vision to scale biobased chemical solutions using domestic agricultural feedstock.

Kemvera’s proprietary catalytic platform converts biobased and CO₂-derived feedstocks, such as domestically sourced corn ethanol, into affordable, drop-in chemicals. The platform is rapidly advancing toward commercial readiness, positioning Kemvera to support U.S. farmers, underpin domestic manufacturing, and sustain the United States as a global leader in biobased chemical production.

Chemical manufacturing is one of the largest segments of U.S. manufacturing, yet much of the feedstock supply is derived from petroleum. According to a 2025 research report, the domestic green chemicals market is projected to reach USD 7.46 billion by 2033, representing a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 7.8% from 2025. To meet this growing demand, Kemvera’s approach integrates partnerships with ethanol producers and agricultural stakeholders to create a vertically connected and sustainable domestic value chain, from Midwest cornfields to industrial end users.

“Having reached these milestones, we are entering a new phase of development that brings us significantly closer to customer delivery. This progress represents the culmination of first-principles-based research and engineering into scalable, affordable chemical production using American-grown feedstocks. This, along with renaming to Kemvera, marks a defining moment for our company,” said Chern-Hooi Lim, founder and CEO of Kemvera.

“The Iowa Corn Promotion Board supports the continued development of biobased chemicals that use domestically grown corn as a feedstock,” said Joe Roberts, President of Iowa Corn Promotion Board, who farms in Belmond, Iowa. “Innovations like this help create new, high-value markets for corn, strengthen rural economies, and build on the success of corn ethanol by expanding domestic bio-manufacturing. Advancing solutions that convert corn into essential industrial products reinforces the role of U.S. agriculture in meeting growing market demand.”

Kemvera envisions the near-term usage of its flagship products, bio-acetic acid and bio-ethyl acetate, in footwear and disinfectants, and later, in a myriad of everyday consumer products. By producing materials from domestic biobased inputs, Kemvera offers chemical customers and brand owners reliable alternatives to fossil-derived products while reinforcing U.S. supply chain resilience.

Kemvera’s vision aligns with national priorities for domestic manufacturing, agricultural value-add, and U.S. leadership in advanced materials. To support this, the company is raising Series A funding and seeking partnerships with ethanol producers, chemical companies and consumer brands. By anchoring production in renewable American agricultural products, the company seeks to unlock new demand for chemicals made with domestically grown crops, like corn, while reducing reliance on imported and fossil-based chemical products.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Kemvera_Jan26_31038db884.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 17:57:24.497567

The orders came from 205 customers in 50 countries. The Company also saw a strong market momentum for its Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) in 2025. In terms of unit bookings, Airbus Helicopters secured a market share of 51% of the civil and parapublic market and its military market share rose to 28%. The Company delivered 392 helicopters in 2025.

“Airbus Helicopters’ outstanding performance in 2025, marked by an order intake increase close to 20% in units, demonstrates that our modern civil and military portfolios are delivering the precise mission capabilities required in today’s complex environment,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “Our focus on defence and security has never been sharper. Furthermore, we are leading the shift toward UAS by integrating Survey Copter into our core operations, establishing a comprehensive range of tactical drones. By combining drones with our advanced and unique HTeaming capabilities, we provide a seamless, networked ecosystem for the modern battlespace. I want to thank our customers for their unwavering trust as we continue to pioneer the future of aerospace,” he added.

The year was defined by major sovereign commitments, most notably from Spain, which placed a landmark order for 100 helicopters—including 50 H145Ms, 31 NH90s for all three branches of the armed forces, and the first orders for the H175M. Germany continued its modernisation by exercising an option for 20 additional H145Ms (bringing the total to 82), with the first helicopters already delivered. Meanwhile, the NH90 programme saw a renewed momentum: the Netherlands added three aircraft to their fleet, Greece signed a critical follow-on support contract, and Germany took delivery of its first NH90 Sea Tiger, the latest evolution for world-leading Anti-Submarine and Anti-Surface Warfare capabilities.

In the heavy segment, the Super Puma family proved its versatility as Greece ordered eight H215s for firefighting. The H225M reached new milestones with Morocco signing a contract for ten H225M helicopters, along with first deliveries to Iraq. The light twin segment was equally robust, with Spain placing an order for 13 H135 helicopters and the UK National Police Air Service ordering seven H135s. With 149 orders, the H145 has once again reaffirmed its position as the best seller on the civil and parapublic and military markets.

Airbus signaled a new chapter in vertical lift at VERTICON 2025 with the unveiling of the H140, a next-generation light twin-engine helicopter. Incorporating techno-bricks like the T-tail configuration, the H140 has already secured 61 firm orders. Innovation also reached new heights with Racer which surpassed its original performance targets to achieve a cruise speed of 440 km/h (240 kts), reaffirming Airbus’ ability to deliver speed with a simpler aerodynamically optimised architecture.

The Company also established a comprehensive tactical drone range by integrating Survey Copter into its core offerings. Airbus signed its first UAS contracts with Drone Forge and the European Maritime Safety Agency opting for Flexrotor and the French Ministry of Armed Forces ordering six VSR700s. Through HTeaming, Airbus is pioneering the crewed-uncrewed teaming with a standalone solution that allows crews to manage uncrewed systems in real-time, multiplying mission capabilities.

This technological leap is mirrored in the H160 programme, which saw its military version, the H160M “Guépard”, complete its maiden flight in July. The H160 confirmed its successful entry into service by securing approximately 50% of the civil and parapublic market share in the medium twin segment. The first H160 in a law enforcement configuration was delivered to the French Gendarmerie Nationale and the programme added firefighting to its mission profiles with a delivery to Hiroshima City Fire Services Bureau and an order from the Nagoya City Fire Bureau. The H160 also began offshore operations for the Energy sector in the U.S. with operator PHI Aviation. The H175 received 15 orders in 2025, solidifying its position in the super medium segment.

To support this unprecedented demand, Airbus Helicopters continued to expand its global industrial base. In 2025, work commenced on a new Final Assembly Line (FAL) in Vemagal, Karnataka, India. To be inaugurated in the coming weeks, this facility will become the world’s fourth H125 FAL, reinforcing Airbus’ commitment to the Indian market and global supply chain resilience.

The acquisition of the 50 jets increases ACG’s Boeing 737 MAX order book to 121, including 50 firm orders for the 737-10, Boeing said in a statement on Jan. 13 (NYSE: BA).
The 50-count order is split evenly between the Boeing 737-8 and 737-10 models, with deliveries scheduled for 2032 and 2033.
ACG says the new fuel can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional aviation fuel.
“All of our aircraft are capable of flying with up to a 50% blend of SAF,” said the environmental report.","Aviation Capital Group has placed an order for 50 Boeing 737 Max jets to be leased out to commercial airlines, as the company sees growing demand for fuel-efficient planes.

Chief Executive Tom Baker declined to specify the price for the 50 new jetliners, though he said a catalog price would be “well in excess of $7 billion.”

“We do not pay catalog list prices. We pay much less than that,” Baker told the Business Journal.

The announcement is another positive signal for the Newport Beach-based firm, which has significantly recovered from the pandemic years when the travel industry was decimated and the Ukraine war, where it recently reported recuperating $545 million in insurance claims after its planes were “stolen” by Russia.

Last year was a “strong market” when it delivered 46 aircraft, the company said at a December presentation at Goldman Sachs 16th Annual Aircraft Leasing Conference.

ACG, as it is commonly called, had approximately 470 owned, managed and committed aircraft as of Sept. 30 that were leased to roughly 90 airlines in approximately 50 countries. The term “committed” refers to aircraft on order.

“We’re about $14 billion dollars in assets under management right now,” Baker said. “We definitely want to be bigger than that.”

‘Our Children’

Baker considers his company’s billions of dollars’ worth of leased-out jetliners as more than just expensive flying machines.

“They’re our airplanes. They’re our assets. We love our children very deeply,” Baker said during a Jan. 20 interview. “We care about their condition and their health.

“We make sure that the lessee takes very, very good care of them and pays for proper maintenance, submits the proper records, keeps the airplane in good condition according to the terms of the lease.”

Its customers range from United Airlines to Air France, Hungary’s Wizz Air, Poland’s LOT, Italy’s ITA and Virgin Australia.

ACG calls itself a major global airplane lessor based in California. Baker said ACG’s biggest competitor is Los Angeles-based Air Lease, which analysts expected to report $3 billion in 2025 sales; it has a $7.1 billion market cap (NYSE: AL).

The acquisition of the 50 jets increases ACG’s Boeing 737 MAX order book to 121, including 50 firm orders for the 737-10, Boeing said in a statement on Jan. 13 (NYSE: BA).

The 50-count order is split evenly between the Boeing 737-8 and 737-10 models, with deliveries scheduled for 2032 and 2033.

The company also has commitments to another 73 planes from Airbus, the European consortium.

The typical first lease is for 12 years, according to the ACG CEO.

“We deliver them an airplane. We help them retrofit the airplane. We finance the costs of that retrofit in the lease,” according to Baker.

In turn, the airlines are responsible for leasing costs, maintenance, crew, insurance and related charges, he said.

Among recent jetliner deliveries, ACG announced on Dec. 26 the delivery of a new Boeing 737 MAX 8 to LOT Polish Airlines.

A month earlier, ACG announced the delivery of its first new Airbus A220-300 to Italian carrier ITA Airways, a new customer for ACG.

ACG says it also provides certain aircraft asset management services and aircraft financing solutions for third parties.

The company has about 135 full-time employees worldwide, with approximately 85 in Newport Beach.

ACG is currently located at 840 Newport Center Drive and will move to 520 Newport Center Drive this year, according to Baker.

Leasing Increasingly Popular

ACG was founded in 1989; Newport Beach-based Pacific Life Insurance Co. in 2005 took a majority stake and, for several years, floated a possible IPO for ACG. However, Pacific Life sold ACG to Tokyo Century Corp. in 2019, where it is now a wholly owned subsidiary.

While the practice of leasing jetliners may be little known to ordinary passengers, it provides more flexibility for the air carriers.

“Airlines have a choice between buying their aircraft or leasing them. Leasing has emerged as the preferred option, rising from roughly 10% of the total fleet in the 1970s to 58% at the end of 2023,” the International Air Transport Association said in 2024.

9-Month Revenue Up Slightly

On Nov. 12, ACG reported total revenues of $934.7 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2025, up slightly from $923.1 million a year prior.

Total pre-tax net income, excluding insurance proceeds, was $124 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2025.

ACG funds its purchases from various sources, including the U.S. bond market and loans from a syndicate of more than 50 banks, according to Baker. It has investment grade ratings of Baa2 from Moody’s and a BBB from S&P Global.

­ACG on Jan. 22 announced the closing of its sale of $1 billion of senior unsecured notes.

The company said it intends to use the net proceeds from the notes for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of commercial aircraft and the repayment of outstanding indebtedness.

ACG Collects $545M in Insurance After Russia ‘Stole’ its Planes

Aviation Capital Group said nine of its jetliners were seized in Russia after Vladimir Putin’s nation invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

ACG CEO and President Tom Baker said at the time that the loss was covered by insurance.

Now, several years later, some major insurance sums have been paid to ACG.

“The key message there is we got made whole, but it took us four years to do it,” Baker said, referring to the aircraft as having been “stolen.”

The company said in November that it had received a net benefit of $544.8 million from the “settlement of insurance claims related to our losses incurred from Russia exposure.”

ACG listed $574.7 million in its annual financial statements as Russia-related losses for 2022. The company also said in the statements that it had incurred “damages in excess of $700 million” from the Russian seizure.

Baker explained that the $700 million figure is the “fully loaded number to include the value of the airplanes, the costs of recovery, lost rent, so on and so forth.”

A Backpack Made from an Airline Seat?

Aviation Capital Group is doing its part to reduce airline pollution by recycling old airline seats into what it calls “stylish, high-quality backpacks.”

“The environmental impact is significant, as aircraft seat leather and life vests are made from durable, high-quality materials designed to withstand tough conditions,” the company’s 2024 annual environmental report said.

“By repurposing them, we extend their lifespan, reduce landfill waste and decrease the demand for new raw materials. This sustainable approach lowers the carbon footprint of traditional manufacturing and contributes to a circular economy.”

The company is also beginning to use “sustainable aviation fuel,” which is a renewable alternative to traditional fossil-based jet fuel. The fuel, known as SAF, is produced from waste oils, agricultural residues and non-food crops.

ACG says the new fuel can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional aviation fuel.

“All of our aircraft are capable of flying with up to a 50% blend of SAF,” said the environmental report. “Both Airbus and Boeing are targeting 2030 for 100% SAF capability and certification.”

The Newport Beach-based company has also invested in the United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund and obtained a $550 million senior unsecured term loan with “sustainability-linked terms.”

472, a bill establishing a clean fuel standard in New York, was referred to the state assembly’s environmental conservation committee on Jan. 7.","Dive Brief:

New Mexico’s Environmental Improvement Board voted on Thursday to approve rulemaking for the state’s Clean Transportation Fuel Program after an extensive public hearing process. With the new rules, the regulator threaded the needle between fuel producers eager for a boost to biogas produced on farms and environmental advocates concerned about concentrated animal operations.

The program was created by HB 41, which was signed into law in March 2024. The law required the average carbon intensity of fuels used in the state to decline by 20% by 2030 and 30% by 2040, compared with a 2018 baseline.

New Mexico will be the fourth state to implement a clean fuels program when the CTFP goes into effect on April 1. California was the first when its Low Carbon Fuel Standard took effect in 2011, followed by Oregon and Washington. ​

Dive Insight:

New Mexico is one of the country’s largest producers of fossil fuels, but its biofuels industry is relatively small. When HB 41 was passed, the state had just 16 biogas-producing facilities, according to the American Biogas Council.

The rulemaking process involved multiple public hearings as well as an extensive outreach campaign conducted by New Mexico Environment Department staff. Much of the debate concerning biofuels related to carbon intensity values for certain fuels. Food & Water Watch, one of the primary environmental groups involved in the process, urged regulators not to allow avoided methane crediting.

The policy boosts carbon intensity scores for biogas derived from on-farm manure digesters, which work by concentrating manure in lagoons that are kept in anaerobic conditions and produce methane that’s refined into a fuel-quality gas.

California has included avoided methane crediting in the LCFS for several years, leading to debate during the last update of the program in 2024. Industry groups say the practice is a fair way to acknowledge the methane avoided by capturing the greenhouse gases generated by large amounts of manure on farms, while environmental groups say it unnecessarily incentivizes concentrated animal farming and disincentivizes manure management practices that pollute less than digesters.

To address those concerns, NMED proposed guardrails that would help staff determine in the future if a biogas project seeking credits was actually avoiding methane emissions.

In a statement, Alexa Reynaud, Food & Water Watch’s factory farm organizing manager, offered measured praise for regulators and the guardrails included in the final program.

“New Mexico has taken seriously the reality that programs like the Clean Transportation Fuel Program can perversely incentivize factory farms to pollute,” Reynaud said. “Unfortunately, the risk remains for New Mexico’s program, and more programs like these are popping up every year across the country with even more incentives for factory farms to inundate our communities with even more pollution. No climate programs should reward factory farms for polluting.”

Fuel producers were more upbeat about the program’s finalization and its potential to spur other states to action. Clean Fuels Alliance America, an industry group representing the biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel sectors, praised the rulemaking in a release.

“As the first non–West Coast state to implement a clean fuel standard, New Mexico proves that states with strong energy economies can also lead on clean fuel deployment and market certainty,” said Jeff Earl, director of state governmental affairs for Clean Fuels. “This program adds real momentum to clean fuel standard adoption nationwide.”

Advocates for clean fuels programs have eyed the potential for additional states to adopt such policies in recent years.

Among the most significant changes in the new updated Taxonomy is the addition of categories focused on climate transition, expanding the Taxonomy from its initial focus on only green categories.
In the updated Taxonomy, the HKMA said: “The inclusion of transition elements in the Taxonomy is critical for driving the decarbonisation of the real economy.
It enables the mobilisation and scaling up of transition finance to high-emitting sectors, such as energy and manufacturing, to shift systematically towards more sustainable practices.
Another key change in the Taxonomy is the introduction of a Climate Change Adaptation category.","The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Hong Kong’s central banking institution, announced the release of the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance Phase 2A, expanding its classification system for identifying environmentally sustainable economic activities to include transition activities, climate adaptation, and a significantly broader range of sectors and economic activities.

The release of the new update follows the launch by the HKMA in May 2024 of its initial Taxonomy, aimed at providing a framework to allow investors to identify and invest in activities that generate a positive impact on the environment, and to avoid those with a negative impact, as well as to align investments with climate goals, and reduce the risk of investing in assets that are not aligned with a low-carbon future.

At the time, the HKMA said that it aimed to use a phased approach to establishing the Taxonomy, adding more sectors and categories over time, and the central bank subsequently launched a consultation on its proposed “Phase 2A” in September 2025.

Among the most significant changes in the new updated Taxonomy is the addition of categories focused on climate transition, expanding the Taxonomy from its initial focus on only green categories. With the update, the Hong Kong Taxonomy now categorizes climate mitigation activities as Green, indicating that they either already operate at net zero emissions or are aligned with a 1.5°C pathway; Transition, indicating that they are carbon-intensive activities that are on a time-bound decarbonization pathway to align with a 1.5°C trajectory that will ultimately reach net zero in 2050, or; Exclusion, indicating that they are not currently eligible under the Taxonomy, as they are either not aligned with Green or Transition criteria, are incompatible with a 1.5°C future, or are of low climate materiality, with minimal relevance to climate objectives.

In the updated Taxonomy, the HKMA said:

“The inclusion of transition elements in the Taxonomy is critical for driving the decarbonisation of the real economy. It enables the mobilisation and scaling up of transition finance to high-emitting sectors, such as energy and manufacturing, to shift systematically towards more sustainable practices. By defining credible pathways for these sectors to align with net zero goals, the Taxonomy strives to minimise economic disruption in carbon-intensive industries and promote an orderly transition, with a view to balancing environmental imperatives with economic growth.”

The updated Taxonomy introduces two classifications under the Transition category, including “Transition Activity,” which refers to economic activities that are not yet aligned with a 1.5°C pathway but are progressing towards alignment, or enable significant short-term emissions reductions, and “Transition Measure,” referring to specific activity components that could partially improve the emission performance of the activity, such as the purchase of low-carbon energy for aluminum production.

Notably, the criteria utilized for the updated Taxonomy’s transition category include a requirement for the activity to be “time-bound,” with eligibility limited to a prescribed sunset date, which varies by sector and activity based on factors such as technological readiness, environmental impact, and regulatory policies, among others.

Another key change in the Taxonomy is the introduction of a Climate Change Adaptation category. The new category initially includes “adapting measures,” or subcomponents of activities rather than complete standalone activities, such as technologies, processes, materials, practices, or services that positively contribute to the resilience and adaptation of broader activities. The category also launches with a “whitelist” approach, with a curated list of measures that are automatically deemed eligible without the need to meet specific criteria. The HKMA said that in the future, “as global and local understanding of adaptation improve and Hong Kong-specific criteria and thresholds are more robustly established, other more sophisticated assessment approaches… may be explored.”

The update also significantly expands the sectors covered under the Taxonomy from 4 to 6, adding Manufacturing, and Information & Communications Technology, and more than doubles the number of economic activities from 12 to 25, adding activities including transmission and distribution of electricity, district heating and cooling, and low-carbon transport infrastructure, among others.

The HKMA said that development of the next phase of the Taxonomy is already underway, with additional activities such as nuclear and natural gas-fired power generation, hydrogen for electricity generation, sustainable aviation fuel, among others being considered for future development, as well as sectors such as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage and waste and wastewater treatment, alongside further work on adaptation and the exploration of the role of “Do No Significant Harm.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Hong-Kong-MA.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 12:57:40.770914

Analysts attribute this trend to structural production inefficiencies and aging infrastructure, which also contribute to high levels of methane emissions and routine gas flaring.
However, emissions increases were still significant, and methane emissions reportedly grew by 25% due to increased flaring at new wells.
This context highlights the tension between maintaining production levels and pursuing emissions reduction.
Its efforts toward energy efficiency and emissions reduction are thus not just corporate priorities but key components of national climate strategy.","PEMEX reported a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency, part of broader efforts to align the NOC with Mexico’s climate commitments and the international energy transition. The plan, outlined in a press release issued by the company on Jan. 21, 2026, aims for a cumulative reduction in energy consumption of nearly 6.1% by 2030 and cuts in emissions of up to 1.8MMt CO₂e annually. These reductions, PEMEX says, would be equivalent to the annual carbon sequestration of roughly 80 million trees or removing more than 500,000 vehicles from circulation.

At the close of 2025, the company reported a total energy consumption of slightly over 500 petajoules (PJ), underscoring both the scale of its operations and the environmental impact associated with them. PEMEX’s strategy combines near-term operational optimizations with longer-term investments in cleaner technologies and energy diversification. It includes improvements in process efficiency, recovery of flare gas, integrated energy and water management, residual heat recovery, efficient cogeneration, and integration of modern thermal systems.

These actions are part of its evolving ESG strategy and are designed not only to reduce direct emissions but also to enhance operational safety and resources use, positioning PEMEX as a potential national leader in energy management. The strategy also incorporates diversification through solar, wind and bioenergy sources, including biofuels, sustainable aviation fuel, and renewable natural gas, as well as natural climate solutions such as agroforestry projects and efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and land degradation.

PEMEX highlights a long-term vision that extends into advanced technologies such as electromobility, hydrogen (both blue and green), and carbon capture and storage. These initiatives are intended to support a more orderly energy transition consistent with Mexico’s national goals and PEMEX’s Plan Estratégico 2025–2035, which calls for improved sustainability while maintaining energy security.

Industry Context: Rising Emissions and Methane Challenges

Despite these stated ambitions, recent data paint a more nuanced picture of PEMEX’s environmental performance. The company’s carbon emissions climbed by 15.4% in the third quarter of 2025, reaching their highest levels in nearly three years. Between July and September, PEMEX emitted 16.5MMt CO₂e, following a significant increase in the previous quarter. Analysts attribute this trend to structural production inefficiencies and aging infrastructure, which also contribute to high levels of methane emissions and routine gas flaring.

Methane, a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential many times that of CO₂, has been a particular concern for environmental groups and climate policy advocates. PEMEX and the Mexican Petroleum Institute (IMP) took steps to address this in late 2025 by launching a national methane-reduction program in collaboration with the World Bank, under the global “Burning and Methane Reduction” initiative. This initiative focuses on building capacity for detecting, quantifying and mitigating methane leaks, as well as eliminating routine flaring.

The company’s own sustainability commitments, reaffirmed in 2025 with support from the Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Alliance, include pledges to avoid routine flaring in new oil field developments and to eliminate the practice entirely at existing sites by 2030. These pledges complement Mexico’s broader climate targets embedded in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.

However, achieving these goals remains difficult. High emissions have persisted alongside chronic flaring, often due to a lack of available infrastructure to capture and process associated gas. Industry observers have noted that PEMEX flares nearly 10% of the gas it produces, reflecting both technical bottlenecks and limited investment capacity.

Operational and Financial Pressures

Environmental pressures on PEMEX are compounded by the company’s enduring financial and operational constraints. In its 3Q25 operational report, PEMEX noted improvements in safety and a 4.2% reduction in energy consumption compared with prior periods. However, emissions increases were still significant, and methane emissions reportedly grew by 25% due to increased flaring at new wells. In the same report, industrial safety indicators improved, showing a 17% decrease in accident incidence and a 44% reduction in severity, but environmental concerns remain central.

This context highlights the tension between maintaining production levels and pursuing emissions reduction. PEMEX’s dual mandate — to sustain hydrocarbon output while improving sustainability, places it at the center of Mexico’s broader energy policy debates. Policymakers and industry stakeholders continue to wrestle with balancing energy security, economic priorities, and climate obligations, especially as global climate negotiations call for intensified action.

Mexico’s National Emissions and Climate Commitments

Mexico as a whole has made ambitious climate commitments, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 under its updated NDCs presented at COP30. These targets reflect the country’s pledge to mitigate climate change and transition toward cleaner energy systems. However, the robust growth of fossil fuel industries and continued reliance on hydrocarbon revenues pose challenges to realizing these ambitions.

PEMEX, as one of the largest industrial emitters in Mexico, plays a significant role in shaping the country’s emissions profile. Its efforts toward energy efficiency and emissions reduction are thus not just corporate priorities but key components of national climate strategy.

New York State comptroller Thomas DiNapoli has filed a shareholder proposal at Uber on behalf of the state’s Common Retirement Fund, calling on the firm to produce a report explaining how it is addressing alleged incidents of riders being sexually harassed or assaulted. The fund has a stake of $240 million in the company. “For Uber to succeed, its users need to feel safe and not have a shred of doubt about using the service,” DiNapoli said. “The company should increase transparency about what it’s doing to protect riders.”

An Uber spokesperson said: “Over the past two months, we’ve had productive conversations with the New York State Comptroller’s office and look forward to continuing that dialogue. Safety is foundational at Uber. We remain firmly committed to helping protect people on our platform by investing in innovative technology, strong policies, and trusted partnerships with law enforcement and advocates to strengthen in-app safeguards, help prevent harm, and support survivors.”

Over the past year, the global energy landscape has shifted in meaningful ways. Liquefied natural gas, and natural gas overall, gained momentum, while growth in areas like petrochemicals and renewables slowed. Global policy developments shaped how governments and companies make investment and innovation decisions, reinforcing the need for stable, long-term policy frameworks to support next-generation energy solutions.

What became clear in 2025 is that the future will require more energy supply requiring all forms of energy, which includes making traditional fuels more efficient while adding innovative alternative fuels to the mix.

Growing energy demand and evolving regulations will continue to shape 2026. Meeting the global need for more power means expanding energy infrastructure worldwide, which is becoming more challenging. As these systems become increasingly complex, digitalization is emerging as the connective tissue that links infrastructure, data and people. The next phase of progress will be defined by how technology is deployed — not only to cut costs and boost efficiency, but to enable intelligent operations, advance modular solutions and strengthen energy security for responsible growth.

Here are four strategic shifts that will shape the energy sector in 2026.

Digital solutions help meet rising energy demand

Looking ahead, connected solutions — where AI-powered tools are integrated with digitally connected infrastructure — will accelerate the shift of energy companies toward intelligent operations. These tools help strengthen and augment workforce capabilities, extract more value from existing assets, and position energy leaders to meet rising demand with greater confidence. Early adopters are already seeing measurable gains in reliability and workforce efficiency.

Skilled labor constraints remain a challenge as experienced workers retire and turnover stays high. To address this, energy companies are turning to digital solutions that upskill the workforce, maintain reliability and scale operations. AI is playing a critical role, analyzing millions of data points across the plant and using predictive analytics to help optimize performance and prevent downtime in day-to-day operations. It is also empowering junior employees with expertise that would normally take decades to build, helping them handle complex scenarios safely and efficiently.

Digitalization is also helping companies extend the life of existing assets and avoid costly new builds. The focus is shifting toward maximizing reliability and efficiency through predictive maintenance and connected operations. Refineries and petrochemical facilities have spent the past decade laying the groundwork for digitalization, and now advances in 5G, AI and cloud computing are unlocking a new level of operational intelligence. By linking assets and processes across entire enterprises, companies can improve reliability, increase output, reduce energy consumption and minimize equipment wear.

The rapid growth of data centers to power AI is adding pressure to the energy system, driving significant demand for natural gas. But AI can help offset this strain by boosting efficiency and optimizing production. By integrating AI-powered solutions, organizations can better manage energy use, streamline operations and reduce emissions. In 2026, energy leaders will sharpen their focus on where and how to expand capacity. Upgrading and modernizing legacy infrastructure with AI and data-driven systems may prove even more critical than building new facilities to meet global demand.

Energy security moves to the top of the agenda

Connected solutions will play a significant role in supporting energy security, but geopolitical uncertainty — including economic tariffs, sanctions and evolving policies — is driving the need to expand energy sources and infrastructure globally.

To support this expansion, many new projects are being developed in regions where construction and execution can be challenging. Energy leaders are increasingly turning to modular solutions for everything from upgrading and expanding traditional refinery and petrochemical facilities to building new LNG and sustainable aviation fuel plants. Modular solutions are critical in regions where labor and materials are in short supply, but they are also widely sought because they provide certainty in project execution, timelines and budget.

While resources vary by region, advanced technology solutions enable regional expansion and localization efforts by allowing a wider range of feedstocks, like biomass, to be converted into energy sources, supporting global energy security.

LNG expansion offers path to boost energy supply

The global need for responsible energy expansion is driving demand for alternative fuel sources. LNG remains essential to energy security efforts, especially in countries that lack access to traditional fuels and those seeking stable, lower-carbon power options.

To meet this demand, LNG project developers are prioritizing proven, bankable solutions that streamline operations and reduce complexity. Energy producers and operators are investing in process innovation to optimize performance, including end-to-end and modular solutions that can reduce costs and accelerate approval and permitting. This reflects a broader push toward technology-driven efficiency across the value chain.

In 2026, LNG projects will balance increasing scale in the short term with long-term energy needs shaped by shifting global demand. With its lower-carbon profile and transportability, LNG will continue to play a critical role in supporting global energy security.

Regulation is shifting to balance sustainability with economic viability

Broad adoption of alternative fuels remains largely dependent on reducing the cost premium. Policy and technology alignment will be essential to accelerating progress in sectors such as shipping and aviation, where new fuels compete with traditional options on both performance and price.

Making energy alternatives economically viable will require a combination of factors, including technological innovation, lower project costs and supportive regulatory frameworks. Companies that can adapt quickly to changing rules and broaden their portfolio to diversify their energy mix will be well-positioned to lead in a more fluid, policy-driven energy environment.

For businesses, it’s a question that applies to almost everything, from product innovation to climate impact—an area of increasing urgency for many.

The goal of achieving net-zero is now a staple of most businesses’ annual plans, however the journey there is often challenging. It can be fraught with hidden trade-offs, making it difficult for ESG leaders to know whether they are truly backing the right solutions in pursuit of their climate goals.

Take aviation, for example. As one of the world’s most difficult sectors to decarbonize, its 2.5% share of global CO2 emissions represents a major challenge for nearly every corporate climate plan. To solve this, the industry developed a solution called Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Unlike traditional jet fuel made from crude oil, SAF is produced from renewable sources like used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and other plant-based materials. Crucially, it’s designed to work with existing aircraft engines, allowing airlines to dramatically reduce their carbon footprint without having to build new planes.

While promising a dramatic reduction in air travel’s carbon footprint, the well-intentioned race to scale this “green” fuel has created a dangerous paradox, leading companies down a path that risks undermining the goals they are trying to achieve.

THE HIDDEN FLAW IN GREEN JET FUEL

SAF has quickly become the poster child for sustainable flight, as it cuts an aircraft’s lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. However, the way we scale SAF matters just as much as the volumes we achieve. Many of today’s biofuels rely on crops grown on arable land, creating direct competition with food production and increasing the risk of deforestation and biodiversity loss.

This is the hidden flaw in the first wave of green jet fuel. When the same land that could grow food or support forests is converted for use in jet fuel, claims of sustainability become less convincing. This approach risks incentivizing solutions that reduce carbon emissions on spreadsheets while increasing the social and environmental risks in reality.

At the same time, no one should underestimate the scale of aviation’s challenge. Industry roadmaps state that to align with net-zero targets by 2050, the sector will need hundreds of millions of tons of SAF per year, compared to only a few million tons produced per year today. We must choose the right path to close that gap over the next quarter-century.

The world generates an enormous amount of waste every year, from used cooking oil and animal fats to agricultural residues such as corn cobs, straw, and empty fruit bunches. Much of this material is mismanaged, leading to open burning, water contamination, and methane emissions as organic waste decomposes. Turning this waste into fuel tackles two problems at once: it avoids methane and pollution from unmanaged waste, and it displaces fossil fuels in sectors like aviation.

FROM PILOT TO SCALE: PROOF IN THE REAL WORLD

The key question for any sustainability solution is simple: Can it scale?

advertisement

For waste-based SAF, the answer is increasingly yes. At EcoCeres, our first large-scale renewable fuels plant in Jiangsu, China—which launched in 2021—demonstrated that industrial-scale production of SAF from 100% waste oils is commercially viable, with a capacity of around 350,000 tons per year.

Now, that model is scaling. In January 2026, we officially opened our new production facility in Johor, Malaysia. With 420,000 tons of annual renewable fuel capacity, it’s one of the country’s first dedicated SAF facilities and it effectively doubles EcoCeres’ SAF production capability. The plant utilizes 100% waste-based feedstocks, supported by a strategy that secures used cooking oil and other residues across Asia. Its circular model is demonstrated by facilities certified under leading industry bodies like ISCC (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification) and CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation). It has moved beyond pilots and is now delivering at industrial scale, proving the viability of truly circular SAF.

SAF AS A GATEWAY TO CREDIBLE NET-ZERO FOR BUSINESS

For many global companies, business travel and air freight form a substantial share of their carbon emissions. Without a scalable, credible source of SAF, corporate net-zero pledges risk becoming aspirational rather than actionable.

It’s clear that a more sophisticated standard for green fuel is needed. Three simple criteria can guide better decisions:

Feedstock integrity: Does the fuel rely on 100% waste and residue-based feedstocks that do not compete with food or high-value ecosystems?

Verified lifecycle impact: Does it achieve high lifecycle emissions reductions validated by robust, third-party certification schemes aligned with global standards?

Circular and local co-benefits: Does the solution tangibly reduce local pollution and create sustainable economic opportunities in the regions where waste is collected?

Applying these tests can differentiate between models that simply shift problems elsewhere and circular solutions that create compounded benefits.

CLOSE THE LOOP ON GLOBAL MOBILITY

The concept of a circular economy has successfully reshaped countless industries. For years, however, global aviation has remained a critical open loop. A truly circular, waste-based SAF model can help us finally close the loop on global mobility.

This is not a distant dream. As we’ve demonstrated, the technology is already proven and operating at scale. Global studies confirm that underutilized waste streams can support the production of hundreds of millions of tons of sustainable fuel, more than enough to bridge the current supply gap. As more of the world’s waste is brought into productive use, the idea of flying on circular fuel moves from promising pilot to practical reality.

For the business leaders and ESG teams asking, “How can we do better?” this presents a clear and actionable path. By championing a higher standard for the fuels they endorse, they can help transform one of the world’s most difficult climate challenges into a story of innovation and opportunity.

The plant is running at around 95% of its nameplate capacity, Ecoceres CEO Matti Lievonen said at an inauguration event for the plant, which opened in October.

Ecoceres, jointly controlled by Hong Kong's city gas company Towngas and U.S.-based Bain Capital, exported its first SAF cargo from the plant in December, to Europe, which Lievonen said accounted for the major part of demand.

It also has an eye on Asia as countries such as Singapore, South Korea and Japan start rolling out mandates for the green aviation fuel. Malaysia itself is exploring a possible 1% SAF blending mandate.

Ecoceres, which has operated a separate biofuel plant in east China since 2021, now directly supplies airlines such as Air New Zealand, Qantas, Air France and Lufthansa rather than going through traders, Lievonen said.

Feedstock has mostly been procured from China, Malaysia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, he added.

Ecoceres' Zhangjiagang plant, which can produce up to 350,000 tpy of SAF and HVO, won government export quotas last year as China began regulating its nascent SAF market, Lievonen said.

What is Agentic AI and how does it differ from generative AI?

Since 2022, there has been an explosion in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) affecting how we work and communicate. Most people have become familiar with one form of AI called generative AI, encompassing chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini and image generators such as DALL-E, Midjourney.

These systems are fundamentally reactive, needing an input or a prompt to generate an output. A new system, however, is beginning to gain traction – agentic AI.

By contrast, agentic AI is a proactive system. Agentic AI, like generative AI, begins with a prompt; however, this is used to pursue objectives through multiple actions. All with limited human involvement, it acts like a proactive assistant rather than a reactive tool.

Airports and their complex operations are the reasons why Agentic AI”

The cycle of agentic AI follows as:

Perception is the starting point. The AI gathers information from its surroundings using sources such as sensors, application programming interfaces, internal databases or direct interaction with users. This ensures the system is working with current and relevant data before taking any action.

Reasoning follows once information has been collected. The AI analyses the data to understand meaning, context and intent. Using capabilities such as natural language processing, computer vision and pattern analysis, it interprets inputs, identifies relationships and determines what is happening within the wider environment.

Goal setting defines what the AI is trying to achieve. Based on user instructions or predefined objectives, the system establishes clear goals and outlines a plan to reach them. This planning stage may rely on decision logic, reinforcement learning or structured problem-solving methods.

Decision-making involves evaluating possible actions and selecting the most effective option. The AI compares outcomes based on criteria such as efficiency, accuracy, reliability and expected impact, using probabilistic models or machine learning techniques to guide its choice.

Execution is where decisions are put into action. The AI carries out tasks by interacting with external systems, triggering automated processes, updating records or responding directly to users as required.

Learning and adaptation occur after actions are completed. The AI assesses results, gathers feedback and adjusts its behaviour to improve future performance. Over time, this enables the system to handle similar tasks more effectively.

Orchestration ensures that multiple agents and systems work together smoothly. Orchestration frameworks manage workflows, co-ordinate resources, monitor progress and handle exceptions, allowing large numbers of agents to operate collaboratively at scale.

Watch an in-depth explainer here:

What impact will agentic AI have on airports?

Airports and their complex operations are the reasons why Agentic AI will transform the industry and boost efficiency. When a passenger travels through an airport, they are travelling through a highly interconnected system. There are many touch points they will come across: parking, checking in, baggage, security, retail, and boarding. These processes are all linked, though involve multiple independent stakeholders such as airlines, airports, ground handlers, regulators, and service providers, each controlling different parts of the passenger journey.

All with limited human involvement, it acts like a proactive assistant rather than a reactive tool”

On top of this, airports generate vast volumes of real-time event data, from check-ins and security throughput to aircraft movements, weather updates, and transport flows, which change continuously and require rapid responses. Delays of even a few minutes can disrupt, a challenge historically worsened by siloed data and limited information sharing. Agentic AI, leveraging modern cloud and data platforms, provides a way to connect these dots, enabling faster, smarter, and more coordinated decision-making across the entire airport ecosystem.

Below are some areas where agentic AI could impact and benefit the airport:

Highly dynamic environments: Airports manage constantly changing variables including flight schedules, passenger flows, baggage handling, and ground transport. Small delays can cascade into larger operational disruptions.

Multiple stakeholders: Airlines, ground handlers, security authorities, retailers, and regulators all operate independently, making co-ordination complex. Agentic AI can act as a bridge, aligning decisions across these groups.

Real-time data everywhere: Sensors, check-ins, baggage scanners, aircraft movements, and weather feeds generate massive streams of information. AI agents can process this data instantly to make timely, informed decisions.

Personalised passenger experience: Agentic AI can anticipate passenger needs by integrating airline preferences, travel history, and real-time conditions. Passengers could receive proactive guidance on security queues, gate changes, transport connections, and even personalised offers in lounges or retail areas.

Frictionless travel through automation: AI agents can orchestrate identity verification, boarding, and baggage handling using biometrics, reducing the need for paper documents and manual intervention.

Proactive disruption management: When delays or disruptions occur, agentic AI can automatically rebook passengers, optimise staffing, redirect flows, and communicate updates, reducing chaos and improving recovery times.

Connected, intelligent operations: By linking disparate systems and stakeholders, agentic AI transforms airports from reactive, siloed environments into adaptive, co-ordinated ecosystems that respond intelligently to real-world events.

Early adopters

Agentic AI is set to transform airports by turning complex, fragmented operations into connected, intelligent ecosystems. Airports that adopt these technologies early will gain a significant advantage, improving efficiency, resilience, and overall passenger satisfaction while redefining the travel experience.

Adani Airport Holdings Limited (AAHL), a subsidiary of Adani Enterprises Limited and India’s largest operator of Public Private Partnership airports, is an early adopter, having already announced a strategic partnership with AIONOS, to implement a multilingual, omni-channel AI solution across its airport network.

The collaboration will see Agentic AI platform deliver personalised, real-time assistance to passengers via voice, chat, web and mobile interfaces. The system will operate in multiple languages, including English, Hindi and regional dialects, and will be available 24/7 to provide flight updates, gate information, baggage status, directions and other airport services.

Another early adopter includes VINCI Airports is trialling a virtual assistant powered by agentic artificial intelligence at Lyon Airport. Developed by startup Jumbo Mana, the 3D avatar provides real‑time information to passengers and responds to their questions. The system uses advanced AI and lifelike animation to create a realistic, human‑like interaction.

To explore these possibilities firsthand, join us at the International Airport Review Breakfast Briefing at Crowne Plaza, London Docklands on 18 March 2026. The event will showcase high-value use cases, demonstrate Agentic AI in action, and provide insights on how to implement these solutions effectively. Don’t miss this opportunity to network with industry peers, gain practical knowledge, and position your airport as a recognised innovator in the future of airport operations.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2671234705.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 11:58:02.712776

finalize commissioning and reliability improvements, and

conduct certain shareholder relations activities related to the updates and modifications at XCF’s New Rise Reno refinery.

The ultimate objective of the incremental funding is to bring the New Rise Reno facility into sustained commercial production and support the ramp-up of SAF output.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF commented: “We are excited to formalize a proposed final structure with DevvStream and Southern on what we believe will be a very accretive and excellent opportunity. We believe this combination has the potential to further validate the value XCF brings to the SAF industry while increasing shareholder value and providing alternative clean fuel opportunities. If consummated, this merger has the potential to solidify our footprint in North America as the supreme SAF producer.”

Sunny Trinh, Chief Executive Officer of DevvStream commented: “We believe the next phase of SAF adoption will favor U.S.-based platforms that can move quickly, operate at scale, and better integrate environmental attributes into the fuel value chain to support project economics and customer confidence. If progressed, this merger would bring together complementary strengths—XCF’s scale and speed-to-market, Southern’s biomass feedstock focus, and DevvStream’s environmental-asset capabilities—with the shared objective of building a globally competitive low-carbon fuels platform grounded in real operating execution.”

Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy Renewables added: ""Southern’s approach is centered on sustainable biomass feedstocks and scalable fuel pathways, and we see meaningful potential in combining that focus with XCF’s production footprint and ability to accelerate commercialization. Subject to completing the necessary documentation, and approvals, we believe this collaboration could create a U.S.-based platform that can compete globally.”

He warned “without regulation, there is no market” for costly biofuels and criticised the jump from 2% SAF in 2025 to 6% in 2030 as “forcing overinvestment for a limited market.”

While airlines push for more SAF and accuse TotalEnergies of underinvesting, Pouyanné said the company could supply 10% SAF by 2030, but that would come at a cost. He fears weakened targets will strand biorefinery assets. He argued that solar and wind abatement costs around US$200 per ton of CO₂, compared with US$350–400 for biofuels, calling for a focus on “the most affordable and sustainable as possible.”

Power plant outages in eastern US during gas supply squeeze and freezing weather

A major winter storm and constrained gas supplies have forced about 21 GW of generation offline in the PJM interconnection (roughly 16% of an average Sunday demand), hence triggering pre‑emergency load curtailments and record‑high spot prices. Power prices in the PJM interconnection, New York and New England jumped to US$400–US$700/MWh, with Dominion’s Virginia zone briefly spiking above US$1,800/MWh compared to US$200/MWh the prior morning.

New England met nearly 40% of demand with oil-fired plants, while gas fell to 30%, resulting in rapidly eroding reserve margins. PJM now forecasts a new winter peak of 147.2 GW, surpassing the previous record of 143.7 GW set in January 2025, driven by data centre loads, leaving nearly 1 million customers without power across several Southern and Mid‑Atlantic states. Grids warned that prolonged cold and fuel logistics could deepen reliability risks.

Chilean regulator fines Antofagasta’s Centinela mine for “non-compliance”

Chile’s environmental regulator (SMA) fined Antofagasta’s Centinela copper mine ~$775,000 for “minor” violations of water management rules tied to its El Tesoro project following a prior inspection from 2019–2020. SMA found the company failed to properly track water resources, kept no records for the exploration well “LE-1”, and did not measure flows at the “La Cascada” spring as frequently as required under its environmental impact study and monitoring plan.

Antofagasta said it is reviewing the decision, stressing that the SMA resolution “marks the conclusion of a process in which Minera Centinela (Centinela Mine) has actively and transparently collaborated with the authorities” and “reaffirming its commitment to environmental compliance and the sustainable development of its operations.”

A review finds Bangladesh electricity deals add billions to power costs

Bangladesh’s National Review Committee has found that power contracts signed under the 2010 “Speedy Increase of Power and Energy Supply” Act entrenched “organised corruption,” contributed to ~25% higher electricity tariffs, and left the country with around 9,500MW of overcapacity and large annual fiscal losses.

In its review of the Bangladesh Power Development Board’s 25‑year 1,496MW power purchase agreement (PPA) with Adani Power, the committee reported “extensive corruption” indications, including “unusual transactions” to foreign accounts coinciding with the deal. It concluded that the coal pricing formula is based on Indonesian and Australian indices, resulting in Adani Power being 85% more expensive than other Indian imports in 2024.

The panel recommended either renegotiating the coal price or cancelling the Adani contract if talks fail, while leaving any final decision to the next elected government.

India Energy Week provides a space where policy, industry, technology, and investment converge.
It reflects the complexity of India’s energy transition and the confidence with which it is being managed, pragmatically, inclusively, and at scale.","India’s approach to a resilient energy future is centred on availability, affordability, and sustainability. As the world’s fastest-growing major economy, its energy demand is rising at nearly three times the global average, and India is expected to account for around 25% of global energy demand growth over the next two decades.

To manage this responsibly, under the leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, India has built its strategy on four strong pillars. The first is diversification of supplies. The country has expanded its crude oil import basket from 27 countries in 2014 to over 40 countries today, insulating the economy from global volatility. The second pillar is affordability for the common citizen. Despite significant global price shocks, India is among the few countries where fuel prices have declined over the last three years. This has been achieved through calibrated tax interventions and proactive management by public sector oil marketing companies.

Third, India is steadily transitioning towards a gas-based economy. Natural gas is viewed as a critical bridge fuel, and efforts are underway to raise its share in the energy mix from about 6% today to 15% by 2030 through rapid expansion of pipelines, LNG terminals, and city gas distribution networks.

The fourth pillar is the biofuel revolution, which has emerged as a clear success story. India achieved 10% ethanol blending ahead of schedule and is firmly on track to reach 20% by 2025, five years ahead of the original target. Together, these measures enable rapid economic growth while keeping energy secure, affordable, and progressively cleaner.

India is no longer a passive participant in the global energy system. Today, it is a structural growth engine and an increasingly important stabilising force. India sees its role as that of a global bridge, connecting producers and consumers, the developed world and the Global South, and traditional energy systems with emerging clean technologies.

Initiatives such as the Global Biofuels Alliance, which now brings together over 29 countries and 14 international organisations, demonstrate how India is helping to create sustainable and circular energy economies at scale.

Similarly, the India–Middle East– Europe Economic Corridor reflects India’s vision of integrated energy, trade, and digital infrastructure, with clean fuels such as green hydrogen at its core.

Most importantly, India brings a balanced and realistic voice to global energy conversations. For 1.4 billion Indians, and for billions across the developing world, energy security is not solely about decarbonisation. It is about development with dignity. India’s leadership seeks to ensure that the global energy transition remains just, inclusive, and equitable.

Green hydrogen represents one of the most significant opportunities for India. Under the National Green Hydrogen Mission, the country is targeting annual production of 5 million metric tonnes by 2030, with the potential to scale further as export markets develop. Capacities for electrolyser manufacturing and hydrogen production are already being awarded, positioning India as a competitive global hub for green molecules.

Beyond hydrogen, India is making strong progress across several other key areas. Compressed bio-gas is one example, with more than 130 plants already operational and many more under development, converting agricultural waste into clean energy while generating additional income for farmers.

India is also accelerating work on sustainable aviation fuel to decarbonise one of the hardest-to-abate sectors, as well as on second-generation ethanol and waste-to-energy projects that combine technological innovation with social and environmental benefits.

Digitalisation is another important enabler. The use of AI, data analytics, and advanced monitoring systems is improving efficiency across exploration and production, refining, and the rapidly expanding city gas distribution networks. When aligned with policy and scale, technology becomes a powerful driver of transition.

India Energy Week has quickly established itself as one of the world’s most consequential energy platforms, and the 2026 edition will reflect India’s “energy abundance” mindset.

The event will move beyond a simplistic division between traditional and renewable energy. Instead, it will showcase how India is greening its conventional energy sectors through efficiency improvements and emerging solutions, while simultaneously scaling up the fuels and technologies of the future.

India Energy Week provides a space where policy, industry, technology, and investment converge. It reflects the complexity of India’s energy transition and the confidence with which it is being managed, pragmatically, inclusively, and at scale.","https://www.energyconnects.com/media/30lfauj2/170a4236-2.jpg?rxy=0.45709959623149393,0.12179717602203607&width=1200&height=628&v=1dc8c5883201200",N,,2026-01-26 03:57:15.096044

Airlines may be surprise beneficiaries of the popularity of weight loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro thanks to increased profits as a resut of lower fuel costs.

Analysts from Wall Street investment bank Jefferies have calculated that if weight loss trends continue, a 10 per cent slimmer society could yield an average 4 per cent increase in earnings per share among major US airlines.

“A slimmer society = lower fuel consumption,” equities analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu wrote. Fuel makes up 20 to 30 per cent of an airline’s cost, which is reflected in the price of the ticket.

Since 2022, the US adult obesity rate has declined to 37 per cent from about 40 per cent, as GLP-1 appetite and blood sugar regulator drugs reshape the population.

“With the drug now available in pill form and obesity rates falling, broader usage could have further implications for waistlines,” wrote Kahyaoglu, who noted that until GLP-1, passenger weight had been out of the control of many people.

Looking at airlines American, Delta, United and Southwest, her team calculated that a 10 per cent slimmer US society would mean a 2 per cent weight saving, which could trim fuel expenses by up to 1.5 per cent. This would add an average of 3.9 per cent in earnings per share across the four airlines.

Aviation company Honeywell estimates that every 450 grams of a plane’s weight, “including crew, passengers, baggage and the aircraft itself”, totals up to about $US10,000 ($14,436) in annual fuel costs on commercial aircraft.

Sydney-based Peter Harbison, chairman of GreenerAirlines.com, which promotes a greener aviation industry, said that when the GLP-1 drugs were rolled out, there was an expectation once-obese customers could begin to travel, leading to a rise in demand.

“Airlines had already factored in heavier passenger weight years ago,” he said.

“I think the drugs’ impact would be marginal for the weight of aircraft in the short-to-medium term, given there are so many other variables,” Harbison said. “But if you were getting up to 1 per cent of the cost of the flight, it makes a difference.”

In Australia, about 32 per cent of the population was obese in 2022, according to the Bureau of Statistics.

The reported use of the weight loss drugs in the US is higher as well, rising from 5.8 per cent of US adults in early 2024 to 12.4 per cent today.

As of 2025, about 2 per cent of Australians were taking Ozempic and similar GLP-1 drugs. Nearly half of the doses were bought privately.

Aviation lecturer Salim Hijazeen, of Melbourne’s Swinburne University, cautioned that GLP-1s were unlikely to make more than a scant difference to airlines.

“Generally, airlines would try and focus on fuel optimisation more than wanting to plan around what the potential health trends of the population are,” he said.

“It’s very unlikely that something like this could significantly impact the weight of the aircraft in terms of the passenger weight,” he said.

Jefferies’ analyst Kahyaoglu calculated her forecast by combining the weight of 178 passengers aboard a Boeing 737 Max 8, with average pre-Ozempic weight per person being 81.6 kilograms. Factoring in the number of people who take drugs such as Ozempic and their impact, the same passengers’ weight was tallied at an average of 80.7 kilograms.

The former yielded a maximum take-off weight of 82,190 kilograms vs 80,737 kilograms post use of weight loss drugs – a difference of 1453 kilograms.

What's happening?

A new study, published in the journal Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, examined the presence of Tire Wear Particles at the Milan Linate Airport in Italy.

Tire wear particles, or TWPs, are non-exhaust pollutants that shed from tires as they move across pavement.

Researchers found that the airport was a significant local source of hazardous organic compounds, specifically benzothiazole (BTH) components, which can be released from TWPs.

They discovered several types of BTH — which is used to produce antifreeze, de-icing solutions, and pesticides, among other industrial applications — in outdoor air, at levels comparable to those in cities with heavy traffic.

Why is this study concerning?

According to the researchers, this study provided the first evidence of benzothiazoles in atmospheric particulate matter at an airport.

They described the compounds as ""irritant, corrosive, and acutely toxic to living organisms.""

A summary of the research published by News-Medical.net noted that the risk of occupational exposure to BTHs at Milan airport was low.

However, this study helps researchers better understand the environmental impacts of air travel.

For years, scientists have known that airplane exhaust contains harmful air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.

In fact, a 2010 study estimated that aircraft exhaust kills about 8,000 people annually.

Plus, air travel is a major contributor to the overheating of the planet, accounting for about 2.5% of global carbon dioxide pollution and about 4% of warming to date.

What's being done about it?

Airlines and experts have made several exciting advancements that could make air travel more eco-friendly in the future.

For instance, Delta is partnering with JetZero to overhaul its aircraft design, aiming to improve fuel efficiency by 50%.

And one group of scientists discovered that converting municipal solid waste into sustainable aviation fuel could reduce pollution by up to 90%.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pollution-1124240831.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 03:57:45.892578
