These commitments aim to support Vietjet’s new fleet development plan, with the projected delivery of nearly 300 aircraft between 2025 and 2027.

Stephen Murphy, CEO of AV AirFinance, said: “We are delighted to be a long-term strategic partner of Vietjet. This new commitment reflects our strong relationship and willingness to support Vietjet’s resurgent growth in the Asia-Pacific region via new generation aircraft.”

In 2025, Vietjet will begin taking delivery of the first batch of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft from its landmark order of 200 aircraft, valued at over US$24 billion. The deal was originally announced on February 27, 2019, in Vietnam, in the presence of U.S. President Donald Trump. As part of its global growth strategy, the airline is currently in discussions to further expand this historic order.

In addition to its collaboration with Boeing, Vietjet has established long-term strategic partnerships with several major U.S. corporations, including GE, Pratt & Whitney, and Honeywell, with total contract values reaching approximately US$50 billion. Ongoing negotiations are expected to add a further US$14 billion. Notably, Vietjet’s engine and technical service agreements with GE and Pratt & Whitney alone now exceed a combined value of US$10 billion. The airline is also deepening its technology partnerships with leading U.S. firms such as Microsoft, Apple, and Google, while exploring collaboration with SpaceX to integrate advanced technologies across its fleet. These high-value contracts are poised to contribute significantly to reducing the trade imbalance between Vietnam and the United States in the near future.

Dr. Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, Chairwoman of Vietjet, congratulated the signing event and affirmed: “I am steadfast in my commitment to working tirelessly and fostering global partnerships that help bridge cultures, economies, and technologies between Vietnam, the United States, and the wider world.”

With a strategic focus on developing a modern fleet and a global flight network, Vietjet currently operates a fleet of over 115 new, fuel-efficient aircraft, with more than 400 additional aircraft on order.

The company noted it secured the best financing terms in its history for the first 25 MAX 8s on order.","As spotted by ch-aviation, Norwegian Air has announced plans to transition to an all- Boeing 737 MAX 8 fleet by 2030, according to its 2024 annual report released on April 10. The low-cost airline aims to meet its climate goal of reducing CO₂ emissions by 45 percent by that year, a target that hinges on using a fleet of exclusively MAX 8 aircraft powered by a 20 percent blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The 737 MAX 8s are an important part of Norwegian's long-term sustainability and cost-cutting plan since they are more fuel-efficient than the older 737-800 NGs that are already in service.

The shift to a single aircraft type supports operational efficiency, environmental performance, and financial flexibility, the carrier said. Norwegian began ordering the MAX 8s in 2022, with 50 aircraft on the way between 2025 and 2028 and options for 30 more, according to the report. The transition marks a move toward owning more of its fleet rather than leasing, which helps lower costs over time. The airline says SAF and fleet modernization are critical to reaching climate goals, assuming an 80% reduction in life-cycle emissions from SAF.

Sustainability Drives Fleet Strategy

Norwegian's decision to focus solely on the Boeing 737 MAX 8 is primarily driven by sustainability goals. According to the airline's annual report, ""Norwegian's 737 aircraft can fly on up to 50 percent certified SAF today,"" with a 20 percent blend needed to meet its 2030 emission reduction target. That goal assumes the entire fleet is composed of MAX 8s, thanks to the model’s lower fuel consumption and emissions.

These planes are equipped with advanced LEAP-1B engines and winglets that significantly improve fuel efficiency compared to older models, according to Norwegian's website. The B737 MAX 8 also offers Norwegian operational benefits such as lower fuel costs, better environmental performance, and improved passenger experience.

In response to Simple Flying's inquiry, the airline referred inquiries back to the investor relations webpages for additional details.

Fleet Expansion Slows Due To Boeing Delays

While Norwegian is committed to growing its fleet, delivery delays from Boeing have impacted short-term expansion plans. The airline now expects to operate 88 aircraft by summer 2025, slightly below its earlier estimate of 90, according to FlightGlobal. Despite this, CEO Geir Karlsen remains optimistic, noting that three new MAX 8s have already been delivered this year, and production rates appear to be improving.

""We do anticipate to take delivery of 11 to 13 aircraft during 2025,"" Karlsen said in a recent earnings call in February, which would bring the total fleet size to between 94 and 96 aircraft by the end of the year. Most of the MAX 8s are set to replace older Boeing 737-800 NGs, which currently make up the majority of Norwegian's mainline fleet.

Karlsen has stated that the production rate at Boeing is improving, allowing Norwegian to better plan for the peak travel season. Despite slower deliveries, the fleet upgrade remains on track, with the MAX 8s gradually replacing older 737-800 NGs, the carrier said.

Financial Stability Supports Long-Term Goals

In Q1 2025, Norwegian acquired 10 Boeing 737-800s previously on lease, furthering its plan to own more of its aircraft, according to the annual report. The company noted it secured the best financing terms in its history for the first 25 MAX 8s on order. Even with capacity growth slowing to 4 percent in 2025, compared to 13 percent the year before, Norwegian is prioritizing profitability and fleet efficiency over rapid expansion. A profitability program is also underway to manage rising costs, currency impacts, and prepare for the future.

With an operational profit of NOK 1.87 billion in 2024, the second-highest in the company's history, Norwegian maintained a strong financial position. Revenues grew to NOK 35.3 billion, a 38 percent increase year-over-year, supported by the integration of Widerøe, Norwegian's regional subsidiary. The group's total fleet at the end of 2024 was 135 aircraft, including 49 from Widerøe and 86 from Norwegian itself.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/se-rtj_737_max_norwegian_vby_01-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-12 17:56:06.583901

US President Donald Trump tariffs are now threatening to significantly impact the premium inflight offerings of major U.S. carriers, Delta and United Airlines. With the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on European goods, including luxury French Champagne, passengers flying in premium cabins may soon find that their favorite bubbles are no longer available at 35,000 feet. Both airlines, known for their investment in high-end passenger experiences, have long relied on prestigious French Champagne to elevate their service in business and first class. This shift in policy could redefine luxury travel for high-end passengers, forcing airlines to reassess their premium service offerings.

Delta and United Airlines have cultivated their reputation by offering premium products, such as Taittinger Brut Reserve and Laurent-Perrier La Cuvée, to attract affluent travelers. These signature brands have helped distinguish these carriers in a competitive market, where service quality is paramount. However, the proposed tariffs threaten to increase costs, potentially forcing both airlines to swap these renowned labels for more cost-effective alternatives, such as domestic sparkling wines. If the tariffs proceed as planned, this could alter the premium travel landscape, challenging the airlines’ ability to maintain the luxury experience that high-end travelers expect.

Delta Air Lines (DL) and United Airlines (UA), two of the largest US carriers, are facing a challenge to their premium inflight service offerings, specifically regarding the high-end Champagne served in their business and first-class cabins. With the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on European imports, including luxury French Champagne, Delta and United might be forced to rethink their inflight beverage offerings. These tariffs, which initially set at 20% before being temporarily paused, have raised significant concerns in the aviation industry. For airlines that have invested heavily in their premium cabins to attract affluent international travelers, the tariff-induced price increases could threaten partnerships with prestigious Champagne houses and undermine the luxury experience they offer to premium passengers.

Impact of Trump’s Tariffs on Luxury Inflight Offerings

The tariffs on French wines, including Champagne, come as part of the broader economic policies promoted by the Trump administration, which seeks to reduce dependence on foreign imports while boosting domestic production. However, these tariffs threaten to disrupt one of the key selling points for premium cabins on international flights — luxurious inflight dining experiences. For Delta and United, whose business models rely on offering an upscale experience to attract high-value international travelers, the removal of premium Champagne could affect their competitive positioning.

In February 2025, Delta introduced Taittinger Brut Reserve Champagne in its Delta One cabins, and United Airlines followed suit in January 2025 with Laurent-Perrier La Cuvée in its Polaris Business Class. These Champagne selections are associated with European sophistication and elegance, helping to differentiate these airlines from their competitors in a highly competitive market. Emirates, Singapore Airlines, and Qatar Airways, all major players in the luxury travel segment, have long been known for their exceptional inflight service, including fine wines and Champagne. By serving renowned French Champagne, Delta and United positioned themselves as rivals in the luxury market, catering to travelers who value exclusive in-flight experiences.

Tariffs on European Goods and Potential Consequences

The tariff proposals, which initially imposed a 20% duty on European products, threaten the very foundation of the high-end service that both airlines have worked to develop. Although the 20% tariff was paused for 90 days, a potential 10% tariff remains a significant concern. If the tariffs move forward as planned, Delta and United may face cost increases on the French Champagne they serve, which could lead to substantial financial strain. These price hikes may force the airlines to reconsider their premium drink offerings, particularly as they balance profitability with customer satisfaction.

Airlines like Delta and United may have negotiated favorable deals with Champagne producers in the past, securing reduced prices in exchange for brand exposure to affluent passengers. However, the introduction of tariffs could unravel these partnerships, as the price increase would make it difficult for the airlines to absorb the added cost. As the cost of serving luxury French Champagne rises, the airlines may look to more cost-effective alternatives, such as domestic sparkling wines from California’s Napa Valley. While wineries like Schramsberg and Domaine Carneros produce high-quality sparkling wines, they lack the same global recognition and allure as prestigious Champagne brands like Taittinger and Laurent-Perrier.

Luxury Inflight Service and Airline Competitiveness

The decision to serve premium Champagne is not simply a matter of taste; it is a critical differentiator for airlines looking to attract premium-paying customers. Business and first-class passengers are not just paying for a seat; they are purchasing an experience. The inclusion of French Champagne has long been seen as a symbol of luxury, class, and international sophistication. In a crowded marketplace where airlines compete to offer the best service, losing such a signature luxury offering could diminish the perceived value of an airline’s premium cabins.

For Delta and United, the stakes are particularly high. Both airlines have made significant investments in their premium services in recent years, hoping to capture more of the lucrative international business market. Delta’s Taittinger Brut Reserve and United’s Laurent-Perrier La Cuvée have been central to their efforts to create a luxurious, world-class inflight experience. However, with the tariffs in place, the airlines may be forced to reduce their focus on high-end, international luxury, shifting towards more affordable domestic products. This shift could dilute the premium experience, impacting brand perception and potentially alienating loyal passengers who expect top-tier offerings.

Economic Impact and Cost-Cutting Measures

Delta and United Airlines are already grappling with cost-cutting measures due to softer demand for domestic travel. The broader economic environment, marked by inflation and changing consumer behavior, has created additional pressure on airlines to remain profitable while maintaining their premium services. Although international premium travel remains relatively stable, the uncertainty in global economic conditions has led both carriers to assess their inflight offerings carefully.

A major concern for both airlines is the broader impact of the tariffs on inbound international traffic. In recent months, data has shown a significant decline in the number of visitors to the United States, with a 17% decrease in visitors from Western Europe in March 2025 compared to the previous year. This reduction in inbound travel, coupled with high tariff costs, could make it more difficult for airlines to maintain profitability on their international routes, particularly in premium cabins.

For United, the situation is even more pressing. The airline is expected to release its Q1 financial results soon, which will shed more light on how tariffs and changing travel patterns are impacting revenue from its high-margin Polaris business-class product. With fewer international passengers traveling to the US and higher operational costs, airlines may need to rethink their pricing strategies and make tough decisions about how to balance luxury service with financial sustainability.

Policy Impacts on Airline Strategy

The Trump administration’s policy of imposing tariffs on European goods, including Champagne, could have long-lasting consequences on the competitive positioning of US airlines. Premium cabin passengers—corporate travelers, frequent flyers, and affluent tourists—are often willing to pay a premium for the added luxury and comfort of international flights. By removing the prestige of French Champagne from inflight service, US carriers like Delta and United risk losing a key differentiating feature in a market where Middle Eastern and Asian carriers offer unparalleled luxury experiences.

In this context, the tariffs are not just an economic issue but a branding challenge for US airlines. For Delta and United, the presence of luxury French Champagne is part of their strategy to appeal to high-spending international travelers who expect top-tier service. Removing these signature items could lead to a decline in brand perception, especially among travelers accustomed to exceptional service and luxury offerings. Without these distinctive touches, these airlines may find it harder to justify their premium fares, particularly on international routes where competition is fierce.

Looking Ahead: Strategic Decisions for Delta and United Airlines

As both Delta and United evaluate the impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs, they face a strategic dilemma: should they absorb the cost increases associated with tariffs or redefine luxury for the post-tariff era? The future of luxury inflight service hinges on how airlines choose to respond to these challenges. While serving domestic sparkling wines may be a viable cost-saving solution, it is uncertain whether it will meet the expectations of discerning passengers who value European sophistication.

In the coming months, both airlines will likely need to make critical decisions about how to balance the cost of premium products with the overall luxury experience they offer. The tariffs have forced airlines to reevaluate their offerings and adjust to a new economic reality. As Delta and United adapt, they must continue to innovate and offer an exceptional travel experience to retain their competitive edge in the global aviation market.

Conclusion

The proposed Trump tariffs on European goods present a significant challenge to the luxury inflight offerings of Delta and United Airlines. With the potential removal of premium French Champagne from business and first-class cabins, these airlines face tough choices regarding how to maintain their competitive edge in the premium travel market. As they navigate these challenges, their ability to balance cost-efficiency with luxury service will be critical to maintaining their standing in the global aviation sector. The coming months will be crucial as these carriers evaluate how to adapt to a post-tariff world and continue to attract high-value passengers.

Delta Airlines and United Airlines: A Comparative Analysis of Two Aviation Giants

Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are two of the largest and most influential carriers in the global aviation industry. With extensive networks, a focus on premium services, and a strong presence in both domestic and international markets, these airlines have shaped the evolution of modern air travel. However, despite their shared prominence, Delta and United have followed distinct strategies to maintain and grow their businesses, especially in an increasingly competitive landscape marked by economic challenges, changing consumer preferences, and evolving industry regulations.

Delta Airlines: A Focus on Customer Experience and Operational Excellence

Delta Air Lines, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, has long been recognized for its operational excellence and customer-centric approach. The airline, which traces its origins back to 1924, has consistently ranked highly in terms of customer satisfaction and service reliability. Delta operates a massive domestic network, but its international reach is also impressive, with key hubs in cities like New York (JFK), Los Angeles (LAX), and Atlanta (ATL).

One of the cornerstones of Delta’s strategy is its focus on improving the passenger experience. The airline has made substantial investments in its fleet, with modern aircraft featuring advanced amenities such as larger cabins, more comfortable seating, and in-flight entertainment. Delta’s premium services, particularly in its Delta One business class, have been key to attracting high-value international passengers. For example, the recent introduction of Taittinger Brut Reserve Champagne in Delta One is a testament to the airline’s commitment to offering a premium travel experience for its business-class customers.

Delta has also been a leader in customer loyalty programs, particularly with its SkyMiles program. By offering a wide range of benefits for frequent flyers, such as access to exclusive lounges and priority boarding, Delta has solidified a loyal customer base. Additionally, the airline has focused on improving its operational efficiency, with a strong emphasis on on-time performance, a critical factor in maintaining customer satisfaction.

In terms of sustainability, Delta has set ambitious goals, including a pledge to become carbon neutral by 2030. The airline has invested in more fuel-efficient aircraft, adopted sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) initiatives, and implemented various eco-friendly practices within its operations.

United Airlines: Global Expansion and Market Leadership

United Airlines, based in Chicago, Illinois, is another aviation powerhouse with an extensive global network. Like Delta, United has deep roots in the American aviation industry, tracing its origins to 1926. However, United’s approach to growth has often been more focused on strategic alliances and global expansion.

One of the major strengths of United Airlines is its international network. The airline operates more transatlantic flights than any other US carrier, with key hubs in Chicago (ORD), Newark (EWR), and San Francisco (SFO). United’s presence in Europe, Asia, and Latin America has been bolstered through numerous codeshare agreements and partnerships, such as those with Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines. This global reach makes United a strong contender in the international market, particularly among corporate travelers and international tourists.

United’s premium cabin, Polaris Business Class, is another area where the airline has worked to compete with top-tier carriers. The introduction of high-end Champagne like Laurent-Perrier La Cuvée in Polaris was a key move to attract luxury travelers and set the airline apart from its competitors. This premium service, paired with newly designed cabins featuring flat-bed seats, luxury bedding, and state-of-the-art entertainment options, has been a significant part of United’s strategy to regain market share in the lucrative international business class market.

United Airlines also places a strong emphasis on technology and innovation. The airline was one of the first to integrate mobile check-ins, in-flight Wi-Fi, and biometric screening at select airports. United’s commitment to improving its digital infrastructure and providing more convenience for passengers has made it a leader in the tech-driven transformation of the airline industry.

In terms of environmental initiatives, United has been a vocal advocate for sustainability. The airline has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 50% by 2050 and has made significant investments in fuel-efficient aircraft and sustainable aviation fuel. United also partners with various sustainability-focused organizations to explore alternative technologies, such as electric aircraft.

Challenges Faced by Both Airlines

While Delta and United have been successful in many areas, both airlines face their own unique set of challenges. The aviation industry as a whole is dealing with rising fuel costs, fluctuating demand for air travel, and the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For Delta, the challenge lies in balancing its premium service offerings with cost-cutting measures in response to economic uncertainty. Similarly, United has had to contend with its reputation for service reliability, as issues with delayed flights and overbooked planes have occasionally tarnished its customer service record.

Moreover, both airlines are facing the fallout from the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on European goods, which threaten to disrupt the premium service they offer, including the possibility of removing luxury French Champagne from inflight menus. These tariff-induced price increases could force both airlines to reconsider their premium offerings, particularly in business and first-class cabins, where luxury and high-end service are key to attracting affluent travelers.

The Future: A Competitive and Evolving Industry

As the airline industry continues to recover and evolve, Delta and United will need to adapt to the changing demands of passengers and the realities of global competition. Both airlines are working hard to maintain their strong positions in the market, with a focus on premium service offerings, digital innovation, sustainability, and global expansion. Their success will depend on how well they navigate challenges such as rising costs, shifting consumer preferences, and new regulations.

In the coming years, Delta and United will need to focus on retaining their premium customers while attracting new ones. For Delta, continuing to invest in customer service and loyalty programs will be crucial. For United, its global expansion and tech innovations will be key to sustaining its competitive advantage. Both airlines will also need to place a greater emphasis on sustainability, both to meet environmental goals and to appeal to increasingly eco-conscious travelers.

In conclusion, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are two giants in the aviation industry, each with its own strengths and strategies. While Delta focuses heavily on customer experience and operational excellence, United has carved out a competitive edge with its global reach and technological advancements. As the airline industry faces continued challenges and transformation, both carriers are likely to play a critical role in shaping the future of global air travel.

In recent years, private air travel has experienced a striking surge in demand. Once viewed as an exclusive luxury for celebrities and top executives, private aviation is now more accessible and appealing to a broader audience of high-net-worth individuals and businesses. One major development is the notable increase in interest in private jets for sale, as more travelers decide to invest in ownership rather than rely on chartering.

The shift from renting to owning is being driven by multiple factors, including changing perceptions of luxury travel, concerns over health and convenience, and the increasing ease of finding planes for sale through trusted online platforms. These changes have transformed how people approach private aviation, making it a functional, cost-effective solution instead of a mere status symbol.

A Pandemic-Driven Shift in Travel Habits

The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a significant turning point in the private aviation industry. With global travel restrictions and mounting health concerns, many travelers who had never flown privately began exploring safer, more flexible alternatives to commercial airlines. Private jets offered a controlled environment, personalized service, and the ability to avoid crowded airports—attributes that quickly attracted a new wave of users.

While many of these users initially opted to rent or charter jets, their experiences often revealed limitations such as scheduling issues, high seasonal demand, and limited customization. This exposure planted the seeds for long-term commitment to private travel, leading many to explore ownership opportunities.

Ownership as a Smart Investment

One of the most compelling reasons people are purchasing private jets today is the realization that ownership is often more practical and financially sound in the long run—especially for frequent travelers. Owning an aircraft eliminates the recurring costs of rentals, gives complete scheduling freedom, and adds a layer of flexibility that’s hard to match with charter services.

For businesses, the time saved and productivity gained from seamless air travel justifies the initial investment. Executives can travel between multiple cities or countries in one day, conduct meetings in privacy, and remain productive throughout. Jet ownership is increasingly seen as an essential tool for business efficiency rather than an extravagant expense.

Personalization and Prestige

Owning a private jet offers unmatched customization. From cabin layout and interior design to in-flight menus and entertainment, owners can curate every detail of their flying experience. This level of control and consistency is impossible to achieve with rented jets, which often vary in quality and features.

Beyond the practical benefits, ownership also carries a strong sense of prestige. For many affluent individuals and companies, having a branded aircraft reflects their success, attention to quality, and commitment to excellence.

Supply Chain and Aircraft Availability

Another trend fueling the increase in purchases is the tightening supply of charter jets and growing backlogs with manufacturers. As more buyers enter the market, demand is outpacing supply, especially for popular aircraft models. Pre-owned jets are selling faster than ever, often within days of being listed.

This urgency has led prospective buyers to act quickly and decisively. Many are turning to digital marketplaces where they can easily compare prices, configurations, and specifications, allowing for informed purchases with minimal delays.

Global Wealth and New Buyers

The world is witnessing a significant expansion of global wealth. New millionaires and billionaires are emerging not just from traditional financial hubs like the U.S. and Europe, but also from fast-growing economies in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. These buyers, particularly younger entrepreneurs and tech-savvy investors, are bringing new energy into the private aviation space.

Unlike older generations who may have preferred renting, these younger buyers are more inclined toward ownership, driven by a combination of practical needs and lifestyle aspirations. For them, having a private jet is not just about luxury—it’s about control, flexibility, and being able to operate on their own terms.

Evolving Business Needs

Companies are also becoming major players in the private jet ownership boom. In a competitive global marketplace, time-sensitive decisions often require face-to-face meetings, sometimes in remote or underserved areas where commercial flights are limited. Private jets allow teams to travel efficiently and execute deals faster, helping businesses maintain an edge.

Moreover, many organizations are now viewing private aircraft as a strategic asset. Aircraft management services have made ownership easier than ever by handling maintenance, staffing, logistics, and compliance, making it a turnkey experience for busy professionals.

A Greener Future for Private Aviation

Sustainability concerns are beginning to shape private aviation as well. Newer aircraft models are more fuel-efficient and compatible with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Environmental responsibility, once a concern for critics of private flying, is becoming a focal point for manufacturers and owners alike.

Tech innovation is also leading to developments in hybrid and electric propulsion, suggesting a future where private jet travel could be both luxurious and eco-conscious. Buyers today are more informed and are selecting jets with better emissions profiles, advanced avionics, and quieter engines.

Final Thoughts: The Future of Jet Ownership

The increase in private jet ownership marks a significant evolution in how people view air travel. What was once reserved for the elite few is now a realistic option for a wider group of high-net-worth individuals and businesses. With safety, convenience, efficiency, and control being top priorities, ownership delivers where renting often falls short.

As platforms continue to make the acquisition process more accessible and options easier to compare, the private aviation market is only expected to grow. Buyers are no longer simply investing in a mode of transportation—they’re investing in autonomy, opportunity, and an enhanced way of life.

Whether it’s the dream of avoiding commercial airport chaos, building a personalized luxury travel experience, or maximizing business potential, private jet ownership offers unmatched value. The sky isn’t the limit—it’s just the beginning.

Entre les détracteurs du transport aérien et ses farouches défenseurs, la guerre des arguments est ouverte.

Imed Dérouiche","L’enjeu est de taille avec un choix cornélien qui prévaut : Faut se soucier du développement du tourisme avec son impact sur l’économie et les emplois ou se préoccuper de l’ampleur du trafic aérien avec la multiplication des vols et les conséquences sur le climat et l’environnement ? Peut-on concilier essor touristique et préservation écologique ? Existe-il une alternative à l’avion, moyen de transport énergivore et extrêmement polluant ?

Autant de questions qui interpellent les climatologues qui prônent un SAF avec des carburants d’aviation durables et les acteurs du tourisme mondial dont le transport aérien est un pilier incontournable et indispensable pour la pérennité et le développement de l’activité.

Entre les détracteurs du transport aérien et ses farouches défenseurs, la guerre des arguments est ouverte. Et si les premiers avancent l’empreinte carbone élevée du transport aérien comme argument irréfutable de sa grande pollution, les climato sceptiques rétorquent que le calcul de l’empreinte carbone est calculée sur la base d’un trajet d’un point A à un point B sans pour autant tenir compte du nombre de passagers. L’empreinte carbone ne doit pas être calculée sur la base d’un avion mais sur la base de nombre de passagers.

L’équation est certes, inextricable mathématiquement entre un développement croissant du transport aérien avec ses répercussions économiques d’un côté et les aspirations écologiques et environnementales qui appellent à une taxation de l’aérien pour réduire le trafic, décongestionner les autoroutes du ciel et purifier la planète.

La tendance générale est à un allégement du trafic aérien et d’ailleurs plusieurs propositions sont à l’étude comme celle de l’ONU qui préconise de réduire de 20 % le trafic aérien afin de diminuer les émissions de CO2 ou de certaines ONG écologistes qui proposent une sur–taxation du transport aérien avec pour conséquence immédiate une augmentation exponentielle du prix des billets d’avion et la disparition de facto des compagnies Low-Cost qui ont, certes démocratisé les voyages mais aussi et surtout augmenté le trafic et par conséquent l’émanation de CO2.

La mobilité aérienne risque de devenir inaccessible et j’invite les amoureux des découvertes à faire le plein des voyages avant 2030 car au-delà de cette date, nous allons avoir une flambée des prix et une disparition pure et simple des compagnies Low-cost qui vont se transformer en High -cost exclusives à une niche comme ce fut le cas dans les années 70.

L’autre conséquence de cette tendance verte du transport aérien est l’impact sur le tourisme et j’appelle les professionnels du secteur à anticiper avec une refonte totale de la stratégie réceptive et au modèle économique car avec des prix d’avion élevés, le tourisme de masse et l’hôtellerie simple ne seront plus viables et l’alternative serait un tourisme de qualité basé sur l’excellence du service, la qualité des prestations, les découvertes patrimoniales et culturelles et l’aventure.

Pour atténuer l’empreinte carbone de cette mobilité aérienne, les alternatives au kérosène paraissent complexes et difficile à atteindre car électrifier les moteurs des avions est domaine de l’impossible à l’heure actuelle et les remplacer demanderait des années de recherche et de développement. La solution la plus rapide serait d’utiliser du carburant vert compatible avec les moteurs actuels mais qui émettent moins de CO2.

Et parmi ces carburant l’alternatif , le SAF ( Sustainable Aviation Fuel) et j’appelle les avionneurs et compagnies aériennes à opter pour ce carburant dont l’avantage est double : il est issu de matières premières renouvelables comme l’huile de cuisson, résidus de biomasse, déchets agricoles et algues et il ne nécessite pas un changement ou une transformation de moteur et d’ailleurs la compagnie Virgin qui s’est inscrite dans le programme SAF a réalisé un vol transatlantique New-York-Londres 100% SAF pour montrer l’exemple et en faire des émules même si la production de ce fuel propre soit encore limitée et incapable de répondre aux besoins des compagnies.

Le eSAF pourrait à mon avis représenter une opportunité pour la Tunisie, si nous décidons d’en créer une unité pour fournir tous nos Aéroports et ceux de nos voisins pour en faire un Hub du carburant Vert comme point de ravitaillement pour notre compagnie aérienne et les compagnies étrangères qui desservent nos aéroports et aussi comme fer de lance pour notre tourisme qui pourrait se prévaloir du Label Vert.

Tout est réuni pour faire de la Tunisie le Hub du eSAF avec comme point d’ancrage la transformation de la raffinerie STIR de Bizerte dont les équipements sont obsolètes avec un rendement insuffisant qui entrave ses équilibres financiers, en une unité de production de Green Fuel qui pourrait générer des millions de Dollars de bénéfices et servir comme exemple de l’engagement de la Tunisie pour l’environnement et une planète verte.

Ainsi le eSAF parait la réponse idoine à cette équation inextricable et une réponse à ce choix cornélien entre liberté de mouvement, démocratisation des voyages et préservation de la planète en offrant à la fois cette latitude de se déplacer librement, ce besoin de se développer, cette appétence à de nouvelles aspirations et ce droit inaliénable de l’humanité à un environnement sain et propre.

“L’abbandono dei fossil-based aviation fuels non è solo necessario, ma essenziale. In SAS crediamo nel promuovere il progresso attraverso partnership e collaborazione. Una comprensione condivisa del percorso da seguire è fondamentale per apportare un cambiamento reale e duraturo, supportando al contempo la trasformazione del settore”, afferma Mads Brandstrup Nielsen, Senior Vice President Public Affairs, SAS.

“L’e-SAF è un carburante sintetico prodotto da energia elettrica rinnovabile, come l’eolico, il solare o l’idroelettrico. L’e-SAF è a zero emissioni di carbonio, poiché emette solo la quantità di carbonio catturata durante la produzione.

La Bodø Declaration è stata lanciata in seguito all’international SAF seminar tenutosi a Bodø il 9 e 10 aprile, che ha riunito rappresentanti del settore, ricercatori, ONG e la Commissione Europea. L’evento ha evidenziato la necessità di quadri normativi a lungo termine, sicurezza degli investimenti e collaborazione intersettoriale per consentire una transizione credibile.

Via dit ‘frequent flyer’-programma sparen reizigers met elke vliegreis punten, die vervolgens kunnen worden ingeruild voor kortingen of extra’s. Het spaarprogramma, dat populair is onder zakelijke reizigers, beloont ‘veelvliegen’ en is volgens de actievoerders daarom ‘hét symbool van een industrie die weigert de klimaatontwrichting onder ogen te zien’.

Exctinction Rebellion kreeg toestemming om te demonstreren voor de deur van Schiphol, een van de grootste luchthavens van Europa. Desalniettemin betraden tientallen activisten de terminal. Dat deden ze naar eigen zeggen met een vliegticket dat zij konden annuleren en waarvan de boardingpass meermaals kon worden gescand. Daardoor konden meerdere activisten op één ticket de vertrekhal in, de ruimte achter de paspoortcontrole. Daar demonstreerden ze onder meer bij de KLM-lounge.

Gebiedsverbod

Schiphol wil uit veiligheidsoverwegingen niets zeggen over het voorval. Ook zegt het niet hoeveel activisten destijds zijn binnengekomen. Wel stelt de luchthaven dat de beveiliging inmiddels is aangescherpt. De koninklijke marechaussee, die de orde handhaaft op de luchthaven, hield uiteindelijk 67 mensen aan. Dat waren activisten die waren gevraagd om de luchthaven te verlaten, maar dit weigerden.

Uiteindelijk werd aan 38 activisten een gebiedsverbod opgelegd. Dat bevestigt een Schiphol-woordvoerder na publicatie van een opiniestuk in Het Parool, waarin de activisten de maatregel hekelen. Sommigen kregen een verbod van 5 jaar opgelegd, anderen kregen een verbod van 10 jaar aan de broek, omdat zij ‘meerdere andere personen zouden hebben geholpen om ongeoorloofd toegang te krijgen’.

Het gebiedsverbod komt de facto neer op een vliegverbod vanaf de luchthaven, omdat activisten niet langer de terminal mogen betreden. Wel mogen ze nog op het plein voor Schiphol en op Schiphol Plaza komen, het publiek toegankelijke winkelcentrum van de luchthaven.

Demonstratierecht

Extinction Rebellion noemt de straf in het opiniestuk bij monde van Simone Wiegman een ‘gevaarlijke onderdrukking van het demonstratierecht en een disproportionele beperking van de bewegingsvrijheid’. Wiegman is oud KLM-werknemer en nu klimaatactivist. ‘Het demonstratierecht houdt in dat je mag demonstreren op een afstand binnen zicht en gehoor van het onderwerp van je demonstratie, ook wanneer dat zich op privéterrein bevindt. In dit geval is de Frequent Flyer Lounge – waar KLM ‘elite’-passagiers die veel vliegen verwent met gratis hapjes en drankjes – de meest logische plek om te demonstreren.’

De klimaatclub noemt de maatregel disproportioneel, maar daar is Schiphol het niet mee eens. ‘Je demonstreert in beveiligd gebied, en dat is niet de bedoeling. Je overtreedt de huisregels, en als je geen eigen ticket hebt ook gewoon de wet.’ De luchthavenwoordvoerder kon zaterdagmiddag niet zeggen of activisten nog in beroep kunnen gaan tegen het verbod.

Gratis tickets

Exctinction Rebellion zegt een advocaat in de arm te nemen, maar liever ziet de organisatie dat de luchthaven zich bedenkt. ‘Het zou Schiphol sieren als het de toegangsverboden intrekt en in plaats daarvan de huurcontracten van de KLM-lounges opzegt.’",https://image.volkskrant.nl/208214966/feature-crop/1200/630/een-blokkade-van-extinction-rebellion-voor-de-centrale-ingang,N,,2025-04-12 12:57:51.255316

Elles demandent à revoir ces contraintes en avançant le coût élevé de ces fuels durables et leur disponibilité aléatoire. Ce que contestent les producteurs.

Comme certains constructeurs automobiles, le monde de l’aérien cherche à revoir les obligations environnementales qui le touchent. Depuis cette année, une directive européenne, ReFuelEU, oblige les fournisseurs de carburant à distribuer du kérosène contenant au moins 2% de carburant durable, ou SAF (sustainable aviation fuel), pour tous les vols partant de l’UE.

La directive prévoit une proportion de 6% en 2030, et de 70% en 2050. En outre, elle impose qu’une part minimale de 1,2% de carburant de synthèse, ou e-fuel, fabriqué au départ d’hydrogène produit avec de l’électricité renouvelable, soit incorporée à partir de 2030, pour monter à 35% en 2050.

Pas d’autres solutions que les carburants durables

Les carburants durables sont la seule manière de réduire les émissions des vols. Avec l’achat d’avions de dernière génération dont les émissions peuvent être 15% inférieures à celles d’avions plus anciens. Les projets de vols électriques, avec des batteries ou via la production d’électricité au moyen d’hydrogène, sont lointains et improbables. Les autres solutions consistent à restreindre fortement les vols.

Les avions représentent environ 5% des émissions globales de CO2, un niveau qui pourrait doubler d’ici 2050.

Si l’on en croit les déclarations des compagnies aériennes et des aéroports, de grands efforts sont fournis. Ryanair multiplie les communiqués sur les achats de carburants durables. En janvier dernier, la compagnie Wizzair et l’aéroport de Charleroi conviaient la presse pour parler des vols recourant à ces carburants au départ de Gosselies. Déjà, en janvier 2023, Brussels Airport et Brussels Airlines avaient annoncé la première livraison de carburant SAF via un pipeline de l’Otan.

En coulisse, les transporteurs sont plus réticents. Ils avancent que l’offre est insuffisante et les prix trop chers. Le carburant SAF à base de biocarburant coûte 2,5 fois le prix du kérosène. Les carburants synthétiques, qui ne sont pas encore produits industriellement, pourraient arriver à 10 fois.

“La Commission européenne et les États membres doivent désormais prendre leurs responsabilités : les fournisseurs de carburants ne tiennent pas leurs engagements, écrit l’association A4E. Sans action urgente dans les mois à venir, la crédibilité du mandat sera gravement compromise, et une réévaluation des mandats sera nécessaire.” Soit, en fait, une révision des obligations imposées par la directive ReFuelEU. L’A4E met en avant une étude du Boston Consulting Group qui parle d’un déficit de l’offre à l’horizon 2030 (- 30% pour les SAF, – 45% pour les carburants synthétiques).

Neste regrette la timidité des compagnies

Les fournisseurs de carburants durables parlent plutôt d’une demande insuffisante, qui n’encourage pas à investir. L’an dernier, Shell a ainsi gelé un projet dans une usine qui devait produire 800.000 tonnes de SAF par an, à Rotterdam. Le raffineur finlandais Neste, champion européen des carburants durables, se plaint que la demande soit trop tiède. “La demande volontaire de SAF de la part des compagnies aériennes fixant leurs propres objectifs ou en offrant aux passagers la possibilité de payer plus pour compenser le coût supplémentaire du vol avec SAF ne s’est pas matérialisée en 2024 comme prévu, à l’exception de quelques compagnies”, explique Alexander Kueper, vice-président renewable aviation business. Neste ne réduit pas ses investissements mais traverse une période de restructuration pour devenir plus compétitif.

Les producteurs de carburants durables espéraient que les achats “volontaires” donneraient un coup de pouce à la demande et réduiraient davantage les émissions, car les 2% obligatoires cette année n’ont encore qu’un impact environnemental symbolique.

Les illusions des “green fares”

Officiellement, de nombreuses compagnies, comme Brussels Airlines, proposent un “green fare“, un supplément via lequel le passager finance l’achat volontaire de carburant SAF, en plus du minimum réglementaire. Souvent, la majorité de la somme va à une compensation d’émissions par le biais du financement de projets visant à capter du CO2 (notamment par des plantations d’arbres).

“La part de ces achats volontaires de SAF est très modeste. Quand on dissèque les accords annoncés par les compagnies, les volumes ne sont pas là”, confirme Camille Mutrelle, aviation policy officer au sein de l’ONG Transport&Environment.

Même quand une aide publique est fournie, les compagnies ne se précipitent pas forcément. Brussels Airport avait annoncé un petit budget de 1,345 million d’euros, financé par le gouvernement fédéral, pour contribuer à l’achat de carburants durables pour des vols au départ de Bruxelles. “Il n’a pas été entièrement dépensé en 2024, nous continuons à proposer l’aide cette année avec l’argent qui reste”, affirme Ihsane Chioua Lekhli, porte-parole de l’aéroport.

Transport&Environement a établi un classement des compagnies qui prend en compte les actions qu’elles accomplissent pour réduire les émissions de CO2. Ni Ryanair ni le groupe Lufthansa ne figurent dans le top 10. Le groupe le plus “vertueux” est Air France-KLM. “Leurs vols s’opèrent avec 5% de carburant durable sur la base des accords conclus”, relève Camille Mutrelle. Elle précise qu’au sein de la fédération A4E, “Ryanair et Lufthansa figurent parmi les compagnies qui sont les plus demandeuses d’un report des contraintes de la directive ReFuelEU.”

Les passagers payent des surcharges

À court terme, pourtant, les 2% de carburant SAF imposés ne représentent pas un coût énorme. Plusieurs transporteurs font payer une surcharge à leurs passagers. Le groupe Lufthansa, auquel appartient Brussels Airlines, facture, depuis janvier dernier, un supplément de 1 à 72 euros par ticket, selon la destination et la classe, à ne pas confondre avec le supplément “green fare” proposé en option. Air France-KLM facture, depuis 2022, 2 à 24 euros par ticket.

Les compagnies pensent à long terme, quand les obligations seront plus importantes et impacteront davantage le prix du billet. Le carburant constitue généralement une part substantielle des coûts, de 25% à plus de 30%.

Alors, les arguments avancés pour revoir les objectifs se multiplient. Outre le prix, il y a la difficulté à trouver des matières premières pour les biocarburants SAF. Neste, l’un des producteurs les plus importants, dément. “Il existe suffisamment de SAF disponible à l’échelle mondiale pour atteindre l’ensemble des objectifs annuels de ReFuelEU de 2025 à 2029, ainsi que suffisamment de bio-SAF pour respecter l’objectif de 6% de SAF fixé par ReFuelEU en 2030, affirme Alexander Kueper. Par exemple, la capacité de production de SAF de Neste atteindra 1,5 million de tonnes en 2025, ce qui suffirait à respecter l’objectif de 2% de SAF dans l’UE et au Royaume-Uni, estimé à environ 1,1 million de tonnes de SAF par an.”

Et Neste n’est pas le seul fournisseur. Il est même mis sous pression par la concurrence chinoise, qui propose des carburants durables moins chers. Une concurrence qui fait reculer les tarifs, sans toutefois rejoindre celui du kérosène.

“Ce qui préoccupe le plus les compagnies aériennes, ce sont les carburants synthétiques, dont l’incorporation sera obligatoire à partir de 2030”, pointe Camille Mutrelle. Leur surcoût, plus élevé que pour le biocarburant, les effraye.

“Le secteur pétrolier est aux abonnés absents”

L’experte de Transport&Environment convient, avec les compagnies aériennes, qu’il y a un souci pour les e-carburant. Qui va les produire ? “Le secteur pétrolier est aux abonnés absents, il porte une lourde responsabilité dans le manque d’investissements, ce sont surtout des start-up qui s’intéressent à ce marché en devenir, ainsi qu’Engie ou EDF”, poursuit Camille Mutrelle.

Pour produire à grande échelle, ces start-up ont besoin de contrats fermes à long terme. Mais les compagnies aériennes n’en signent guère. “Hormis IAG (British Airways), qui a signé des accords d’achat à long terme, et Norwegian. Aucune compagnie ne s’est vraiment engagée”, regrette l’aviation policy officer de T&E. Il est vrai que pour l’achat de carburant, les accords sont plutôt annuels. Les compagnies répugnent à signer des accords à long terme, à 10 ans. Avec un prix fixé, sans savoir si elles bénéficieront de la meilleure technologie.

La Commission européenne est consciente de ce problème d’œuf et de poule et cherche des solutions. Sinon, le secteur risque le même scénario que pour les voitures électriques et les batteries, les Chinois étant très actifs. “Ils ont de gros projets de production de carburants synthétiques dans le cartons”, confirme Camille Mutrelle.

Cela étant, même si des solutions étaient trouvées pour respecter les objectifs de la directive ReFuelEU, son impact resterait limité. La croissance attendue du trafic aérien, de 3,6% par an jusqu’en 2043, selon Airbus, devrait effacer les gains d’émissions qu’apporteraient les obligations d’incorporation de carburants durables, même avec l’achat d’avions dernier cri.

Pour obtenir une véritable réduction des émissions, il faudrait encore augmenter significativement la part des carburants durables, non pas la diminuer, et développer leur production. Les avions peuvent, en effet, voler avec 50% de carburant durable, sans doute davantage d’ici 10 ans…","https://img.static-rmg.be/a/view/q75/w1600/h836/f50.00,50.00/7160975/carbu-1-jpg.jpg",N,,2025-04-12 12:57:58.462086

SAS collaborates with a wide range of aviation and energy industry leaders to advocate for the widespread adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), placing a special emphasis on the development of e-SAF (Electro-Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

“The shift away from fossil-based aviation fuels is not only necessary—it is essential. At SAS, we believe in driving progress through partnership and collaboration. A shared understanding of the pathway ahead is crucial for making real and lasting change while supporting the transformation of the industry,” says Mads Brandstrup Nielsen, Senior Vice President Public Affairs at SAS.

E-SAF (electro-synthetic aviation fuel) is a type of fuel generated from renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, or hydropower. This fuel is considered carbon-neutral, as it releases only as much carbon as was absorbed during its production process.

The Bodø Declaration was introduced following the international SAF seminar held in Bodø on April 9–10. The seminar brought together stakeholders from various sectors, including industry leaders, researchers, NGOs, and representatives from the European Commission. The event emphasized the need for stable regulatory frameworks, secure investments, and collaborative efforts across sectors to enable a genuine transition to sustainable aviation fuels.

The declaration builds on initiatives like Project SkyPower, a letter sent to the European Commission in February 2025, spearheaded by SAS, with the support of a diverse coalition of aviation and energy professionals.

Through the Bodø e-SAF Declaration, key stakeholders — including producers, technology providers, aircraft and engine manufacturers, airports, policymakers, and researchers — have come together with a shared goal: to ensure that aviation continues to fulfill its essential role in society while reducing its environmental footprint.

Strategic partnerships play a crucial role in SAS’s sustainability strategy, and the Bodø Declaration is a testament to the cross-industry collaboration needed to drive progress and meet the rapidly growing demand for sustainable aviation solutions. This commitment also traces back to November of the previous year, when SAS entered into an agreement with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, Copenhagen Airport, and Aalborg Airport to support the production of e-SAF in Denmark. This partnership seeks to position Denmark as a leader in sustainable aviation, create jobs, and contribute to the decarbonization of the aviation sector through the Fjord PtX project — a Danish initiative aimed at producing synthetic e-SAF from renewable sources.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/b7bef76107d2829e_org-3-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-12 11:56:33.398976

He added: ""It is not a comparable situation and the behaviour of the company is not comparable to the situation in this case.""

""The PM recognises the strategic importance of Scunthorpe steel, and he really should do the same for Grangemouth oil.""","The closure of Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland is ""not comparable"" to the situation at British Steel in Scunthorpe, MPs have been told.

Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said an emergency law aimed at saving the Lincolnshire site from closure was an ""exceptional situation"".

SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn challenged Reynolds over similarities to the closure of the Scottish refinery on the Firth of Forth - with the loss of 400 jobs.

It came during a rare Saturday sitting of parliament to pass legislation to save the the British Steel plant, opening the door for full nationalisation.

Reynolds told the Commons: ""I understand that some have asked about precedent or referenced other troubled industrial situations.

""To be clear again, this is an exceptional situation, a unique situation.

""The question for all members is whether we as a country want to continue to possess a steel industry, do we want to make the construction steel and rail we need here in the UK, or do we want to be dependent on overseas imports?""

Flynn asked Reynolds whether the Labour party would back a similar bill for Grangemouth.

Scotland's only oil refinery has been marked for closure by owner Petroineos

About 400 of the 2,000 jobs that are based at the industrial complex will be lost.

The Aberdeen South MP said: ""Many minds right now will be very much focused on the situation in Grangemouth, where we know that hundreds of jobs are going to be lost directly, thousands of jobs in the supply chain.

""Would the Labour Party back it in the same way as it is backing this Bill today?""

But Reynolds said the UK government had pledged £200m to secure Grangemouth's ""long-term future"".

He added: ""It is not a comparable situation and the behaviour of the company is not comparable to the situation in this case.""

A report published last month said up to 800 jobs could be created over the next 15 years at the Grangemouth site

The Project Willow study, funded jointly by the Scottish and UK governments, sets out nine areas where there are potential opportunities for green industries.

It said jobs could be created in areas like sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen production and plastics recycling but it would require £3.5bn of private investment.

Brian Leishman, Labour MP for Alloa and Grangemouth, has also called for nationalisation of the Scottish refinery.

He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland there were ""striking similarities between Scunthorpe and Grangemouth"".

He said: ""The government should intervene at Grangemouth to extend refinrery operations until the new energy industies of the future that we are going to need are ready.

""That is the only way that we can really, truly, achieve a just transition for workers and communities.

E-SAF er et syntetisk drivstoff produsert fra fornybar elektrisitet, som vind, sol eller vannkraft. E-SAF er karbonnøytralt, da det bare slipper ut så mye karbon som ble fanget under produksjonen.

Bodø-erklæringen ble lansert etter det internasjonale SAF-seminaret i Bodø 9.–10. april, som samlet industrirepresentanter, forskere, frivillige organisasjoner og EU-kommisjonen. Arrangementet fremhevet behovet for langsiktige regulatoriske rammer, investeringssikkerhet og tverrsektorsamarbeid for å muliggjøre en troverdig overgang.

Aside from keeping the slender, pointed design, Boom distances itself from Concorde, which Scholl calls “a false start” to a supersonic age.
“I’m not convinced the current team assembled has the experience or depth or capability to develop a supersonic engine,” Foley says.
The first American-built civilian supersonic jet is likely to be welcomed by a protectionist federal administration gung-ho on US manufacture and deregulation.
Today, Gratton says it’s “irresponsible” for a supersonic jet that burns two to three times more fuel to be launched in a full-fledged climate crisis.","When I call Blake Scholl from New York, he says it’s a shame we couldn’t have met at his office in Colorado. If only there were a supersonic jet that could cruise at 1.7 times the speed of sound, and get me there two hours quicker than the typical JFK-to-Denver route.

There soon might be. Scholl is the CEO of Boom Supersonic, a company betting that ordinary civilians want to shoot across the sky at 1,100 miles (1,700 kilometres) per hour. After the pandemic brought a slump to the skies, air travel has returned to its former levels, and in-person business events are back on track. As a faster option for these travellers, Boom is developing its breakneck jets to be operational by 2029 – nearly a quarter century after Concorde landed its last plane.

Aside from keeping the slender, pointed design, Boom distances itself from Concorde, which Scholl calls “a false start” to a supersonic age. In Boom’s revived version, its 64-seater airliners could whizz across the Atlantic in three-and-a-half hours, at least twice as fast as commercial carriers, and check off hundreds of new routes such as Madrid to Miami, or Tokyo to Seattle. They would lean into software and algorithms to tweak speed and altitude based on real-time conditions. Boom is already “a darling of the bros at Silicon Valley,” says Brian Foley, a US-based aviation industry analyst and former aerospace engineer, pointing to investors including OpenAI’s Sam Altman.

But sceptics will compare Boom to Concorde, and question whether it can overcome the list of issues that led to its predecessor’s decline, including price, demand, safety, regulation and the environment – all of which may remain stubborn barriers.

To its credit, Boom has appeared to solve one of Concorde’s major hurdles: the sonic boom, the ear-splitting thunderclap heard on the ground when an object travels through the air faster than the speed of sound. When an aeroplane moves, molecules ahead have to get out of the way; as it breaks the sound barrier, the craft catches up and drags the molecules along with it. The sudden disruption causes a shock wave, felt as a deafening roar.

Concorde couldn’t escape the boom as it flew at Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound. “When they got it wrong, it was smashing greenhouses and scaring little old ladies,” says Guy Gratton, associate professor of aviation and the environment at Cranfield University in Bedfordshire. The sheer sound forced noise regulations in Europe, and in the US an outright ban on supersonic flight in 1973, relegating Concorde to oceanic routes such as London to New York.

That isn’t enough for Boom, which wants to capture the domestic business market and fly above land at Mach 1.7. So, in quite the physics feat, Boom has eliminated the sonic boom.

It has put into practice a longstanding theory of refraction known as “Mach cutoff”, which works via the same law that makes a pencil appear to bend in a glass of water in the classic school lab experiment. As the plane flies, the sound wave refracts towards colder temperatures, curling upwards. It keeps turning upwards until it reaches space.

During two supersonic test flights in January and February, with a specially built craft a third of the proposed size, Boom demonstrated the Mach cutoff six times, without an audible boom on each occasion.

Boom’s planned aircraft, Overture, is still in early development and will be a different beast, especially because Boom is making its own engine. That’s rare in an industry where commercial craft invariably use engines from the established giants such as General Electric and Rolls-Royce. “I’m not convinced the current team assembled has the experience or depth or capability to develop a supersonic engine,” Foley says.

If they can do it, their timing is opportune. The first American-built civilian supersonic jet is likely to be welcomed by a protectionist federal administration gung-ho on US manufacture and deregulation. In the Oval Office in February, Donald Trump posed with an Overture model, and Elon Musk pledged to overturn the supersonic ban. The $600m infusion of funding from some of his billionaire peers won’t hurt.

Boom isn’t the only company developing a “quiet” supersonic aircraft. Nasa is testing its own experimental X-59 jet. And an aircraft from China’s state-owned manufacturer Comac is reportedly under way, according to a self-released paper. A patriotic aerospace race could further spur legislation. “Let’s beat ’em,” Scholl posted on X, with a US flag emoji.

But success will ultimately depend on consumer demand. The tragic crash in 2000 of an Air France Concorde catalysed its downfall, which was compounded by the downturn in air travel after 9/11. It’s unclear whether the public wants supersonic travel – or even knows of its existence. The only surveys that exist are Boom’s own (which unsurprisingly claim that 97% of passengers want it); two major aviation research firms told me there’s no real data.

Demand will be driven by affordability. “Concorde was for royalty and rock stars,” Scholl says of its $20,000 tickets in today’s money. He estimates Boom could start at $5,000 for a transatlantic flight, akin to some business-class fares. But at a time of inflation, it’s not cheap. Despite Scholl’s vision for our in-person meeting, freelance journalists are not the target market, though he says he predicts economy-level fares “for the rest of us” by the late 2030s.

Foley isn’t swayed. “This isn’t a ‘scale big’ aerospace segment,” he says. “It’s a very niche market.” Major carriers such as American and United have already put in orders for aircraft, but Foley says that’s a typical PR move for carriers to show their progressiveness. Eventually, they’ll cave to pure cost-per-seat-mile economics. The private jet market may be a better fit, but even with their participation, Foley estimates Boom would probably only sell about 300 aircraft over 10 years.

The private jet sector is routinely under fire for its poor environmental record, burning far more fuel per passenger mile. And while aviation in general accounts for 2.5% of all emissions, the industry continues to grow, leading to predictions it will double its carbon output by 2050.

Scholl says Overture will be built to be compatible with sustainable aviation fuel, and that choosing between innovative tech and the environment is a “mistaken trade-off”. The public may have different ideas. Even in the 1960s, Concorde faced eco-pushback around emerging ozone layer concerns, and advocacy from grassroots campaigns such as the Citizens League Against the Sonic Boom helped secure the bans.

Today, Gratton says it’s “irresponsible” for a supersonic jet that burns two to three times more fuel to be launched in a full-fledged climate crisis. “As an aeronautical engineer, I am absolutely thrilled with what Boom are doing,” he says. “As an environmental scientist, I’m horrified.”

“They are doing very clever work,” Gratton says. “Whether it’s a good idea that they do it – that’s the tougher question.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b281431ab3b1f106c8688d789af70aeff3e8c01a/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=24d7e91e00af6514e2607fbaef3b5638,N,,2025-04-12 09:56:20.355495

The proliferation of out of town shopping centres, urban expansions and a minimal public transport network shaped the transport destiny of my town.
And, most important of all, a good transport network can do precisely the opposite.
But I think we should talk more about ""Swindon style"" transport for Swindon, or ""York style"" transport for York.","Thank you, David, for that introduction.

Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the National Railway Museum in York.

I'm tempted to say we're in the country's finest transport museum, but as a Swindon MP and a former Deputy Mayor for Transport in London, I feel I should tread carefully.

So welcome to ONE of the VERY BEST transport museums in the country!

It feels fitting for me to do my first big transport speech here.

The history of our transport network - the stories of the men and women who designed it, built it, operated and used it - are woven into the fabric of our communities in 21st century Britain.

And it's you - the people in THIS room - who are adding to that rich tapestry every day.

You keep life moving.

You get children to school, commuters to work, and families to their holidays.

You move the goods that stock our shelves, fuel our industries, and keep businesses thriving.

You don't just connect places - you connect people with the things that they need to get on in life.

And it's in the spirit of connection that I'd like to tell you a story.

I hope you won't be disappointed to learn that I haven't invited you here for a big policy announcement or news headline, but rather to share a little bit about who I am and what I believe.

I want to tell you a story about the people and places who have shaped my thinking.

I grew up in Swindon.

A proud railway town on the M4 corridor - a place with much to be proud of.

It's also a humble football town - and I can tell you, that as a Swindon Town supporter, I have learnt the lessons of humility all too well.

By fate and circumstance, that's where my journey began.

Outside our semi detached house, I remember my dad's first van parked up - 'Malcolm Alexander Electrical Services'.

I remember the first bike I was given - blue with a basket on the front - a bit like the blue crate I've got on my bike now.

And I remember learning to drive around the town's infamous Magic Roundabout.

And the car factories that punctuate the town's history - Rover, Honda and now, BMW.

It's fair to say that in 1980s Swindon, the car was king.

It still is.

The proliferation of out of town shopping centres, urban expansions and a minimal public transport network shaped the transport destiny of my town.

Now, I won't pretend that urban planning preoccupied my teenage mind too much.

Back then, I was much more concerned about whether Wham! were going to make it to Number 1.

But when I moved away and got my first job, I began to see the bigger picture…

… that a poor transport network will limit choices.

… that it can block the aspirations of young people.

And, most important of all, a good transport network can do precisely the opposite.

I was the first person in my family to go to university.

And like so many, I found work and opportunities in the capital.

And so it was, at the age of 29, I walked into Lewisham Town Hall as a newly elected councillor - becoming the cabinet member for regeneration just two years later.

I loved that job, and I fell in love with transport.

Now, I'll admit …

It wasn't the language of highways management that enthralled me: ""There's no such thing as a speed hump Cllr Alexander, only speed tables and speed cushions.""

But it was the extension of the East London Line, the creation of new brownfield sites around major railway stations, the improvements to walking and cycling links that really got me hooked.

I learnt quickly that transport shapes a lot more than roads and railways.

And equally important, I learnt that it takes a lot of people to shape transport itself.

At Lewisham, I saw first-hand how transport investment could make a dramatic difference to people's lives.

Take Brockley Railway Station.

For years, it was an uninspiring, inaccessible place.

Uninviting, a bit run down.

Not somewhere you'd instinctively love as you rocked up for your morning commute.

But working with local campaigners, we delivered step-free access, a stunning landscaped ramp and better connectivity along the London Overground.

Today, Brockley is thriving.

It's a place where the old and the new coexist.

The Wetherspoons on the corner and fried chicken shops sit side-by-side with bakeries, breweries and a pedestrianised square.

It was a transport scheme that built a stronger, more connected community.

And, it was transport that made the difference down the road in Lewisham too.

We transformed it - relocating and improving a bus station, moving a roundabout, redesigning the roads, creating land for new homes, new public spaces and new opportunity.

And when I say ""we"", I mean the hundreds of people from different organisations who made it happen - people like you.

When a few years later I became the Member of Parliament for Lewisham East, transport was always right at the top of the list of my constituents' concerns.

The longer train station platforms that were worse than useless without the longer trains to stop at them.

The toxic air being pumped into homes around the South Circular.

And when I later became Deputy Mayor for Transport in London, I had the privilege of working on those concerns more closely than I had ever done before.

Look, London is big.

So yes, naturally, I'm proud of the big stuff:

Straining to keep the capital moving through Covid.

Working on the Elizabeth line to deliver the jewel in the crown of the UK's rail network.

Sticking to my guns on the Silvertown Tunnel, a new river crossing that enables London's red double-deckers to go under the Thames to the east of Tower Bridge for the first time.

But honestly, big doesn't always mean beautiful.

Transport isn't just about the price tag on the project.

It's about delivering a better everyday experience - buses that come on time, accessible stations, well managed road works.

I'm just as proud of the smaller projects that made a big difference - many delivered in London by my good friend and then colleague Will Norman - segregated cycle lanes on Jamaica Road and Evelyn St, more secure cycle parking, slower speeds on roads with high KSIs, a direct vision scheme to improve visibility from the cabs of HGVs.

These were transport interventions which ultimately delivered better public health, as well as better public realm.

So when I moved back to Swindon a couple of years ago, I wasn't just carrying a dream about becoming the MP for my home town.

I arrived with baggage - determined to deliver for Swindon in a similar way to London.

Not the same solutions - as every place is different, but to give people options and opportunity.

There isn't something in the water that makes Swindonians love their cars more than Londoners.

Just a reality that public transport is better in London.

And I think it's a failure of imagination, as much as a failure of policy, that young people in Swindon don't have better options than I had decades ago.

Because change is possible.

Across the country - from Swindon to Shrewsbury, Rotherham to Peterborough - we have underused transport assets.

Unloved railway buildings - land surplus to requirements or land that could be made so.

Neglected stations, like Brockley.

Potential that shouldn't go to waste, but we know that, too often, it does.

And with vision, funding and collaboration, these could become hubs of regeneration, places that don't just usher people through - but bring people together.

We talk about delivering ""London style"" transport to other places.

But I think we should talk more about ""Swindon style"" transport for Swindon, or ""York style"" transport for York.

And I want to support the capability and capacity within councils and combined authorities to deliver regeneration, investment and tangible improvements.

We have great mayors.

We have great local leaders.

We have great organisations working nationally and regionally.

We have a lot of talent in this room and beyond.

So, the question for me, is how do we best harness that?

Obviously, this is a question that has vexed me particularly since I took a call from the Prime Minister at the tail end of November, asking me to serve as his Transport Secretary.

And as someone who has skin in the game as a local MP and a passion to build on the work started by the force of nature, Lou Haigh, I naturally said yes.

And here I am.

Full-circle in some ways, and trying to shape a new path in another.

And the task is to build a better decade for transport.

Towards a better railway…

Laying the foundations for reform - establishing Shadow Great British Railways and launching a consultation on the upcoming Railways Bill to unify track and train .

Towards public ownership…

Passing the Passenger Railway Services Act, with the first operators - Southwestern and c2c - moving into public hands in the coming months.

Towards better buses…

Introducing the Bus Services Bill, giving local authorities greater control over routes, timetables, and fares - backed by over £1 billion in investment to improve reliability and frequency.

Towards better roads…

Investing £1.6 billion in local highways, an uplift of £500 million on last year - enough to fill an extra 7 million potholes.

Towards fairer work…

Enshrining greater protections for seafarers in law.

Towards cleaner skies…

Introducing the Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate and launching a consultation on the revenue certainty mechanism.

Towards a fossil-free future…

Supporting the installation of thousands of new EV charge points-helping to drive record electric car sales, with 31% of new cars sold in December last year being electric.

And towards a transport system that supports the aspirations of everyone in this country…

It's why I am so proud to work with the ministerial team at the Department for Transport.

Like me - and like all of us - they've seen the difference that good services make…

…Whether it's the tap-and-go trams and buses in Mike Kane's patch, with fares capped at £2 on Greater Manchester's Bee Network.

…Or in Simon Lightwood's patch, where the mass transit system will improve integrated travel options in West Yorkshire, improving access to opportunities for people in Leeds and Bradford.

…Or, in Nottingham, where one of the local bus operators, Nottingham City Transport, has been voted UK operator of the year a record six times, with passenger satisfaction amongst the highest in the country. I hear Lilian Greenwood is a pretty good local MP too …

And as for Peter Hendy, who is his own walking museum of transport knowledge, he has a phrase that I would like to steal.

He talks about transport needing to be ""boringly reliable"".

And he's right.

If public transport options are boringly reliable, then it means day-to-day life is easier for everyone.

So, by 2035, I want public transport to play a greater role in national life, becoming the easiest, most attractive choice… brilliantly and boringly reliable.

Enrique Peñalosa, a former mayor of Bogotá, once said:

""An advanced city is not one where the poor have to own a car, but one where the rich choose to use public transport.""

That's a vision I believe in.

But I can picture the headlines now - so let me counter the column inches before they emerge: there is no such thing as a war on motorists.

I drive. I own a car and I love it - a racing green Mini Cooper convertible.

I walk. I cycle.

I take buses, trains, and taxis.

And I'll bet most of you do too.

No serious person is proposing to ask people like my dad, a self employed electrician, to swap their van for a bus, forcing them to lug all their kit around - I certainly am not.

Through his career, my dad was a professional problem solver, and I hope I'll carry the torch for that family tradition.

But I'll be focussing on solving the real problems, not wasting time on the invented ones.

Because I'm sure everybody in this room would agree that where you live shouldn't determine what you can achieve…

…that your hometown, no matter how big or how small, should provide the transport options to meet your aspirations…

… and that - if transport doesn't nurture young people with the opportunities they deserve, then our entire economy misses out on the talent it needs to grow.

That's why we're here today.

To have the conversations that bring us closer together.

I want to harness your talents, your expertise and your drive to solve real problems.

Because, no matter where people are travelling to, they should be proud of where they're coming from.

Thank you, and have a lovely evening.",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/668bb8ba7541f54efe51bb2d/heidi-alexander.jpeg,N,,2025-04-12 10:56:11.246317

Private jet ownership is a financial decision as much as it is a lifestyle one.","Owning a private jet is often perceived as the pinnacle of luxury and convenience, offering unparalleled flexibility and comfort in air travel. However, the financial commitment extends far beyond the initial purchase price. This article provides an in-depth exploration of the various expenses involved, offering a detailed overview to inform your decision-making process.​

Initial acquisition costs: new vs pre-owned

The journey to private jet ownership begins with the acquisition of the aircraft. Prices vary significantly based on factors such as the aircraft's size, range, manufacturer, and whether it's new or pre-owned.​

The next thing to consider when acquiring an aircraft is financing and depreciation. While some buyers may choose to purchase a jet outright, others might explore financing options. Interest rates and loan terms can significantly impact the overall cost. Additionally, private jets depreciate over time, affecting the aircraft's resale value.

Total annual operating costs

Fixed annual costs

Beyond the purchase price, owners must budget for recurring annual expenses that ensure the aircraft remains operational and compliant with aviation regulations.​ Fixed annual costs are expenditures that are incurred regardless of the number of hours flown, such as:

Crew salaries and training

Hangar fees

Insurance

Employing a qualified crew is essential. Annual salaries for pilots and crew members can vary based on experience, aircraft type, and region, with total compensation varying significantly based on factors such as aircraft size and operational requirements. According to BizJetJobs, the average salary of a Global 6000/6500 pilot is in excess of $150,000 a year. Regular training and certifications are also necessary to maintain proficiency and comply with regulations, adding to the overall crew-related expenses.​

Storing the aircraft in a hangar protects it from environmental elements and ensures security. Hangar rental fees can vary based on location, facility quality, and aircraft size. For instance, Singapore Air Charter reports that hangar fees can range from $36,000 to $96,000 a year, depending on the size of the aircraft. Annually, this can amount to significant sums, especially in high-demand areas.​

Lastly, comprehensive insurance coverage is vital to protect against potential liabilities and damages. Annual premiums can range widely based on factors such as aircraft value, usage, coverage limits, and pilot qualifications. According to Flying MAG, premiums can range from $10,000 to $500,000 per year. It's advisable to consult with an insurance broker to tailor coverage to specific needs and ensure adequate protection.​

Variable operating costs

On the flip side of fixed costs are variable costs, which are dependent on the number of hours flown. Operating the jet incurs variable costs that fluctuate based on usage, including:

Fuel expenses

Maintenance and repairs

Landing and handling fees

Fuel is one of the most significant operating expenses. The cost of jet fuel can vary based on market conditions and regions. For example, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) averaged the cost of jet fuel in 2025 to be about $87 per barrel, or approximately $2.07 per gallon, per OPIS. A mid-size jet flying 200 hours annually might consume around 36,000 gallons, totaling approximately $74,520 in fuel costs. However, fluctuations in fuel prices can significantly impact these expenses.​

Next up is maintenance – regular maintenance ensures safety and compliance with aviation standards. According to Singapore Air Charter, annual maintenance costs can range from $500,000 to $1,000,000 (or more), including routine servicing, inspections, and unexpected repairs, depending on the aircraft's age, type, and size. Additionally, older aircraft may require costly upgrades, such as installing Wi-Fi or refurbishing interiors, further adding to maintenance expenses.​

Airports charge fees for landing and ground handling services, which can accumulate significantly over time. These fees vary by airport and region and are influenced by factors such as aircraft size and the services required. While these fees may seem modest individually, they can add up, especially for frequent flyers.​

When combining fixed and variable expenses, the total annual cost of owning and operating a private jet can range widely. Estimates suggest annual costs between a few hundred thousand to a couple of million dollars, depending on factors like aircraft size, usage frequency, and operational choices. These figures underscore the importance of comprehensive budgeting and financial planning for prospective jet owners.​

Alternative ownership models

For those seeking the benefits of private aviation without the full financial commitment, alternative models exist.​

Fractional ownership

This model allows individuals to purchase a share of an aircraft, reducing upfront and operational costs. For example, fractional ownership programs may start at approximately $215,000 for a jet card with 275 hours of annual access, per Stratos Jets. Fractional ownership is particularly attractive for those who fly between 50 and 400 hours per year, offering guaranteed aircraft availability, professional management, and streamlined logistics without the hassle of full-time ownership responsibilities.

Jet cards and membership programs

Similarly, jet cards and private aviation memberships have gained popularity for offering prepaid access to private jet services without long-term commitments. With fixed hourly rates and guaranteed availability, jet card programs provide cost predictability and operational convenience.

In 2025, entry-level jet cards often start around $100,000 to $150,000, with hourly rates typically ranging from $5,000 to $15,000 depending on aircraft category and provider. While these programs do not offer the same level of customization or personal branding as full ownership, they eliminate maintenance and management concerns entirely.

Charter services

Chartering remains a flexible, pay-as-you-go option for occasional travelers. It’s ideal for those flying fewer than 50 hours annually or for those exploring private aviation before committing to ownership. Depending on the aircraft type, distance, and destination, charter flights in 2025 can cost anywhere between $2,000 per hour for a turboprop and over $12,000 per hour for a heavy jet.

Platforms like XO, Wheels Up, and JetASAP have made chartering more accessible by offering digital booking tools and real-time pricing, making this option increasingly appealing for infrequent flyers.

Tax implications and incentives

Private jet ownership offers unique tax implications that can be both a burden and a benefit depending on how the aircraft is used. In some jurisdictions, owners may be eligible for tax deductions on operational expenses if the aircraft is used for business purposes.

In the United States, bonus depreciation continues to be a significant incentive—allowing buyers to deduct a substantial portion of the purchase cost in the year of acquisition. However, this benefit is gradually reducing: according to Aviation Tax Consultants, 2025 offers only 40% bonus depreciation (down from 100% in 2022), unless the aircraft qualifies under a binding contract from prior years that still allows 60% depreciation.

Owners must work closely with aviation tax consultants to structure aircraft ownership and usage properly—especially if combining business and personal travel—to avoid running afoul of IRS scrutiny or triggering unintended tax liabilities.

Environmental considerations and sustainability costs

As global attention shifts towards sustainability, owning a private jet in 2025 also carries an environmental and social cost. The carbon footprint of private aviation is significantly higher than that of commercial flights. In response, many owners are adopting greener practices, such as carbon offsetting programs and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) usage.

Carbon offsetting typically costs between $10 to $50 per metric ton of CO₂. A mid-size jet flying 200 hours a year can produce around 500 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, resulting in offset costs of approximately $5,000 to $25,000 each year. SAF, while reducing lifecycle emissions by up to 80%, is currently two to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

However, as governments and industry invest in greener aviation, some regions offer subsidies or incentives for sustainable practices. The decision to operate sustainably may not be financially mandatory, but for many owners—especially high-profile individuals and corporations—it is becoming a reputational necessity.

Hidden and unexpected expenses

Beyond the obvious and recurring costs, owning a private jet includes several lesser-known expenses that can catch new owners off guard. For example:

Interior Refurbishment: Every few years, owners may opt to update cabin interiors for aesthetic reasons or to stay competitive in the charter market. These upgrades can cost anywhere from $100,000 to over $1 million depending on the materials, layout, and tech integrations.

Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to global aviation standards can result in unexpected costs, such as mandatory avionics upgrades (e.g., ADS-B compliance), international operating permits, or privacy services for flight tracking.

Management Fees: If the owner chooses to work with a management company to handle logistics, staffing, maintenance, and compliance, expect to pay between $100,000 to $250,000 annually for professional oversight.

Opportunity Cost: Tying up millions of dollars in a depreciating asset rather than investing it elsewhere is a financial trade-off often overlooked during the initial excitement of aircraft ownership.

The lifestyle value: is it worth it?

Despite the extensive costs, many jet owners will tell you the value lies not in dollars and cents, but in the lifestyle. The ability to fly on your schedule, access remote airports, avoid commercial travel disruptions, and create a personalized onboard environment offers convenience and peace of mind that money alone can’t measure. For high-level executives, celebrities, or individuals with tight travel schedules and security concerns, this freedom is often worth the expense.

That said, it’s vital to understand the economics. Private jet ownership is a financial decision as much as it is a lifestyle one. Anyone considering it in 2025 should have a clear picture of how often they’ll use the aircraft, what type of aircraft suits their needs, and whether alternative models might better align with their goals and budget.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/main-image-16_9-13-2.png,N,,2025-04-12 09:56:29.033158

En gemensam riktning är avgörande för att skapa verklig förändring och stötta branschens omställning, säger Mads Brandstrup Nielsen, Senior Vice President Public Affairs på SAS i en skriftlig kommentar.

E-SAF är ett syntetiskt bränsle som tillverkas med hjälp av förnybar el från exempelvis vind, sol eller vattenkraft. Det är koldioxidneutralt – eftersom det bara släpper ut den mängd koldioxid som tidigare fångats in vid produktionen.

Satsningen konkretiseras i Bodødeklarationen, som presenterades i samband med ett internationellt SAF-seminarium i norska Bodø den 9–10 april. Där samlades representanter från flygindustrin, forskarvärlden, NGO:er och EU-kommissionen.

Deklarationen bygger vidare på tidigare initiativ som Project SkyPower, där SAS i februari 2025 ledde ett upprop till EU-kommissionen tillsammans med en lång rad branschaktörer.

Målet med Bodødeklarationen är tydligt: att flyget även i framtiden ska kunna fylla sin viktiga roll i samhället – men med minskad klimatpåverkan. Här står flygbolag, teknikleverantörer, flygplatser, motor- och flygplanstillverkare, politiker och forskare enade bakom en gemensam ambition.

För SAS är strategiska partnerskap en nyckel i hållbarhetsarbetet. Ett tydligt exempel är samarbetet med Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, Köpenhamns flygplats och Aalborgs flygplats. I november 2024 tecknade parterna ett avtal om att stötta dansk e-SAF-produktion inom ramen för Fjord PtX-projektet – ett initiativ som ska göra Danmark till en ledare inom hållbart flyg, skapa nya arbetstillfällen och bidra till en fossilfri framtid för branschen.

It was said to have carried up to 200 tons of gold, silver, and uncut gemstones, potentially valued at billions of dollars. Now, Australia has discovered another treasure that might be even bigger. Could you imagine? This treasure is very unique. It might not be gold, silver, or even uncut gemstones, but it will be seen as one of the biggest in history.

The biggest renewable energy treasure in history is green

Renewable energy has become the most sought-after treasure in the 21st century. Now, we might have the biggest treasure yet, thanks to Australian company Vast Renewables Limited. The renewable energy company provides clean energy solutions that enable 24/7 green, cost-effective heat and power. The aim is to decarbonize the grid, green fuel production for the transport industry, and hard-to-abate industries.

Vast’s latest project, the Port Augusta utility-scale clean energy project, Vast Solar 1 (VS1), will include a hydrogen-based green methanol plant, Solar Methanol 1 (SM1). After securing up to AUD180 million of conditional funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), VS1’s construction can commence soon.

VS1 uses Vast’s next-generation concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) solution, and will be the first Australian project to supply essential long-duration renewable energy storage and production. Peak pricing intervals after sunset will be capitalized when isolated renewable energy, like solar energy, is unavailable. This will result in reliable, on-demand clean power to South Australia’s grid.

This treasure has practical applications

This historical treasure can potentially play a key role in pushing the global energy transition. Designed to supply carbon-free power and heat 24/7, VS1 will decarbonize the grid, fuel production for shipping and aviation, specialist industries such as data centers, and industries like mining and refining.

SM1 is being developed by Vast in alliance with a global energy company, Mabanaft. A real-world, in-demand application for hydrogen, green methanol has the potential to decarbonize shipping and is already utilized to power major container vessels.

These revolutionary projects will provide the foundation needed for the future exhibit of Vast’s global pipeline of clean energy projects that supplement intermittent solar panels and wind energy. VS1 and SM1 will contribute to generating green methanol and facilitate sustainable aviation fuel production.

The world will be able to see the result soon

With the much-needed funding from ARENA, VS1’s financing can almost be settled. The front-end engineering design (FEED) and commercial development have already been completed, giving Vast hope that the final investment decision (FID) will be reached. Additional investments are required to satisfy the range of AUD360 million. These additional investments will allow construction to begin in 2025.

Additional investors will also help boost the Australian economy, as Vast’s projects and production pursuits are expected to create dozens of Australian green manufacturing jobs, construction jobs, and long-term plant operations roles.

“By providing green, affordable electricity on demand when other renewables are not available to power homes, industry and fuel production, we deliver the missing piece of the puzzle.” – Craig Wood, CEO of Vast.

Wood announced he was grateful to ARENA and the Australian Government for their continued support for their project’s journey.",https://www.ecoportal.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/661ccc8c85a612bece77e040_vastt.jpg,N,,2025-04-12 02:56:07.102765

With a legacy spanning over 61 years, Royal Jordanian (RJ) is not just Jordan’s flag carrier but a strategic connector between the Levant and the world, fostering tourism, cultural exchange, and regional connectivity.

At the heart of RJ’s vision lies the goal to position Amman as the premier Middle Eastern gateway, supported by the newly launched ExploRJordan brand — a fresh initiative to promote Jordan as a boutique destination blending modernity with authentic Arabian heritage.

Mr. Makhlouf outlines RJ’s robust expansion plans, including a 25% growth target, new non-stop routes to Washington D.C., and a long-awaited return to the Indian market with flights to Mumbai and New Delhi. He also speaks on fleet modernization, the revival of service to Damascus, and RJ’s enhanced partnership with Dnata.

Sustainability is a major pillar of RJ’s future, with the airline aiming to cut carbon emissions by over 32% through new aircraft and eco-conscious practices. This conversation offers a comprehensive look at how Royal Jordanian is redefining itself as a boutique airline for a boutique destination.

Tell us something about Brand RJ.

Royal Jordanian (RJ) is more than just an airline; it is a bridge between cultures, a key enabler of tourism, and a vital connector between the Levant and the world. With over 61 years of heritage, RJ has continuously evolved to reflect the rich legacy and warm hospitality of Jordan. Our vision is to position Amman as the premier gateway in the Middle East, providing seamless connectivity to Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa. We developed a brand called ExploRJordan which is mainly positioning Jordan as contemporary, authentic Arabia with a variety of activities in the line with a new tourism strategy.

Share with our readers about Royal Jordanian’s growth plans for the year 2025.

2025 is going to be a milestone year for us. We are focused on a growth strategy that revolves around two key pillars: boosting tourism in to Jordan and strengthening Amman as a key regional hub. We aim to grow by 25% this year, opening new routes and expanding our fleet to accommodate the rising demand. Our network expansion includes launching direct flights to Washington D.C. and entering the Indian market, which are critical steps towards our vision of enhancing connectivity.

Tell us something about your partnership with Dnata

Our partnership with Dnata represents a strategic move toward strengthening Royal Jordanian’s operational and organizational structure. Recently, we expanded our stake in Dnata’s catering company in Jordan, acquiring a 51% majority shareholding. This step aligns with our broader vision of enhancing our service offerings and supporting our customers’ needs by ensuring top-quality in-flight catering services.

This partnership allows us to leverage Dnata’s global expertise in catering and hospitality while ensuring that our local operations reflect Jordanian culture and hospitality values. It demonstrates our commitment to continuous improvement, operational efficiency, and providing an elevated travel experience for our passengers. Through this collaboration, we aim to further position Royal Jordanian as a leading airline in the region, focusing on both passenger satisfaction and sustainable growth.

After a hiatus of 13 years, Royal Jordanian resumed its flight service to Damascus. How, in your opinion, will this impact global air travel?

In line with our levant strategy we always want to be the first to develop new markets and traffic within the levant region. We started the Syria flight on 31st January 2025 with daily flights allowing Syrians to use Amman as the preferred gateway to Europe, US and the Middle East with flight time of only 35 minutes from Amman to Damascus which is the shortest and fastest gateway to the world. With the increase geopolitical stability in the region, I expect traffic to and from Levant globally to over proportionally grow.

What are your plans to expand RJ’s fleet?

Fleet expansion is at the core of our growth strategy. Over the next one and a half years, we plan to introduce nearly 20 brand-new aircraft, including the Airbus A320neo family, Embraer E2 jets, and Boeing 787-9s for long-haul routes. These additions will not only enhance passenger comfort and experience but also contribute significantly to our sustainability goals by reducing carbon emissions by over 32%. RJ is set as a boutique airline to truly represent the boutique destination Jordan.

What markets do you target for your expansion plans?

Our expansion strategy is focused on strengthening connectivity with key global markets, where we opened more than 15 new routes in the last two years. While we have successfully grown our presence in Europe and North America, 2025 will see a stronger emphasis on Asia, with India being a major target. The Indian market holds immense potential, and we are dedicated to establishing Jordan as a boutique tourism destination for Indian travelers. Additionally, we opened new routes to Libya and Syria in line with our levant strategy. Casablanca will be added in the 3rd quarter to further increase our footprint in the region.

RJ will be launching non-stop flight service to Washington D.C. from mid-March 2025. How, in your opinion, this new route will be catering to the travel demands of passengers from the Middle East and North America?

The Washington D.C. route is a game-changer. There is a substantial demand for direct connectivity between Jordan and the U.S., especially for business travelers, diplomats, and the Jordanian diaspora. This route not only strengthens transatlantic travel but also provides seamless connections for passengers from surrounding Middle Eastern, North American and African countries traveling to the U.S. through Amman. The convenience of a direct flight will enhance travel options and elevate Royal Jordanian’s position in the US market.

Royal Jordanian returns to India after 10 years. Share your two cents on this new expansion plan with our readers.

We are introducing new flights to Mumbai and New Delhi with a complete new strategy in line with the new strategy of ExploRJordan, we are primarily promoting Jordan as a boutique destination. My aim is to double the number of tourism in India from 70,000 to 140,000 within the next 1-2 years. Furthermore, we will insure very high load factors through the selling of connecting flights via Amman to US, Canada, Middle East and North Africa with a global network of over 50 destinations. India as a booming aviation market will be key for our Asia growth strategy, and I foresee an increase in frequency within the next 12-18 months.

What are your goals and achievements in promoting and upholding sustainable aviation?

Sustainability is at the heart of our operations. Our fleet renewal plan is a major step towards reducing our carbon footprint by over 32% within three years. We are integrating fuel-efficient aircraft, optimizing routes, and exploring sustainable aviation fuel options. Additionally, through our ExploRJordan initiative, we actively promote eco-tourism and sustainable travel choices in Jordan, ensuring that we play our part in responsible tourism growth.

How do you describe your journey so far? Where do you wish to see your brand in the next five years?

The journey has been nothing short of remarkable. Despite geopolitical and economic challenges, Royal Jordanian has emerged stronger, with a clear growth vision and a renewed commitment to customer satisfaction. Looking ahead, in the next five years, I envision RJ as a leading boutique airline, setting new benchmarks in service excellence, sustainability, and connectivity. With our ambitious expansion plans and relentless focus on innovation, we are shaping the future of aviation in the region and beyond. RJ is following a strengthened growth with clear expansion targets. With our ExploRJordan initiative we will be the only airline in the region focusing primarily on tourism into Jordan.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SMR_3379-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-12 02:56:14.938629

But over the past seven or eight years, the global energy system has been undergoing a huge transformation.
However, the overall policy focus on the energy transition remains strong.
Join us on Wednesday 16 April for ‘Understanding key trends in the energy transition’, a virtual student event with global law firm White & Case.","White & Case’s Ryan Gawrych and Hannah Bragge unpack life in the firm’s busy Energy, Infrastructure, Project and Asset Finance team

As governments and industries around the world race to decarbonise, lawyers are increasingly needed to advise on the new technologies and innovative deal structures driving the energy transition forward. From financing battery storage facilities to advising on green hydrogen projects, White & Case’s global Energy, Infrastructure, Project and Asset Finance (EIPAF) practice group is helping make it all happen.

Ahead next week’s virtual student event, ‘Understanding key trends in the energy transition — with White & Case‘, we caught up with the speakers, local partner Ryan Gawrych and associate Hannah Bragge, to hear what it’s like to work at the forefront of the energy transition.

Can you tell us a bit about your career journeys so far and what your day-to-day looks like in the EIPAF team at White & Case?

Bragge: I’m originally from Australia and started out at a different firm back home, but I’ve been with White & Case for a few years now, first in the Melbourne office, and more recently in London since August 2023. I focus mostly on project finance, especially in the renewables space, but I’ve also had great exposure to project development work, both at my previous firm and here at White & Case. One of the real strengths of our London team is that juniors and trainees get to work across both the financing and development sides of transactions. That kind of experience early on is really valuable for building a successful career.

Gawrych: Like Hannah, I’m Australian too, and I’ve had a bit of a global journey. I’ve worked in Australia, China, Mongolia, Indonesia, the UAE, the UK and now Germany. I’ve been with White & Case for just over two years and have a background that includes time at major resources companies and other international law firms. My practice is more focused on project development, commercial contracts, and M&A within the energy sector. That’s also what prompted my recent relocation to White & Case’s Hamburg office. I’m advising on low-carbon fuel projects across Europe, and Germany is right at the centre of a lot of the action.

What attracted you to this sector? What do you enjoy most about working on energy transition deals?

Bragge: It’s a mix of things. First, it’s just where the work is — this is where our clients are investing and building right now. But it’s also genuinely interesting. You’re dealing with emerging technologies, which means lenders aren’t always familiar with the risk profiles. A good example is batteries. They’re essential for balancing the grid, but the way they generate revenue differs from market to market and keeps changing. So, there’s a lot of creative legal thinking required. There’s definitely no copy-paste approach here. And personally, I find it exciting to be working on projects that are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.

Gawrych: I’ve been working in the energy sector for quite a while. My career started in mining and oil & gas, especially advising Asian investors in Australian projects. But over the past seven or eight years, the global energy system has been undergoing a huge transformation. The shift away from fossil fuels is driven by everything from the Paris Climate Accords to energy security concerns. Working with big energy clients as they pivot towards renewables and new business models has been fascinating. You’re dealing with projects that have never been done before, or trying to apply lessons from one jurisdiction — say, a hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia — to a totally different legal and commercial context, like France or Germany. It’s blue-sky thinking, and it keeps things interesting.

Have you noticed changes in the market recently, especially with global elections and policy shifts?

Gawrych: While some headlines might suggest a general slowdown in the market, we’re seeing more of a recalibration, with the overall fundamentals remaining solid.

In Europe, there’s still a strong policy drive behind decarbonisation, and building new energy infrastructure remains a top political priority. But as governments are being put under increasing pressure to reallocate funding to defence and other nearshoring initiatives, we’re also seeing regulators and investors apply a higher degree of scrutiny to deal certainty and value for money. The result is a shift away from speculative technologies and structures, toward more mature and commercially viable projects. In the Middle East, we are seeing a slight slowdown in new project announcements, as developers wait to see how other markets play out following recent elections. However, the overall policy focus on the energy transition remains strong.

In the Americas, while there appears to be a policy shift away from renewables in the US, there’s still a lot happening in the energy transition space in relation to sustainable technologies like carbon capture and storage (i.e. things that reduce emissions but don’t necessarily fall under the ‘renewables’ label). And in Asia Pacific, investment in new technologies is also going strong, in particular, in green hydrogen, ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuel. There’s also a lot of innovation coming out of the region around electrification and low-carbon fuels.

It sounds like a global and evolving landscape. What skills do aspiring lawyers need to thrive in this sector — and what should they be doing now to prepare?

Bragge: I think one of the biggest things to understand is that this area of law probably isn’t something you’ll study much at university, if at all. So, if you’re interested in it, you’ve got to be proactive. Read the Financial Times and The Economist. Follow project developers and green investors on LinkedIn to see how they are implementing the latest renewables, energy storage, and low-carbon technologies. White & Case publishes a lot of great materials on the intersection between the legal profession and the energy transitions that you should check-out, but there’s also plenty of other accessible content out there from other international law firms and legal commentators.

When you come into a transactional team like ours, you’ll be learning core legal skills like drafting and managing deal processes, but in our space, a broader awareness of the market really enhances the experience. And it helps you figure out if this work genuinely interests you. If you find yourself reading about a battery storage deal and thinking, “That’s cool, I want to know more,” then that’s a great sign.

Gawrych: I’d echo that. Our group probably has one of the steepest learning curves at the firm; not necessarily on the technical legal side, but in terms of understanding the industries we work in. You need to be curious. If you hear someone mention the HEFA process or green ammonia, and you’ve never come across those terms before, the instinct should be to go away, do some research, and get up to speed. That’s how you build context, which is crucial for our work. These are billion-dollar projects with huge moving parts, from engineering to policy to economics. You don’t have to be an expert from day one, and really our expertise will always be focussed on the law, but having a genuine interest and a willingness to learn about the industries that our clients operate in makes a huge difference.

And finally, what advice would you give students who are looking at firms like White & Case and thinking, ‘I want to be doing this kind of work’?

Bragge: Be curious, be informed, and don’t be afraid to ask questions. If you’re applying to White & Case, show that you understand what the firm actually does. We’re known for cross-border transactional work and complex infrastructure deals. If you’re passionate about global issues, climate change, or the energy sector, say so. And remember, everyone starts somewhere — you’re not expected to know everything, but showing a willingness to learn goes a long way.

Gawrych: I’d say embrace the complexity. It’s what makes the work challenging, but also what makes it rewarding. If you’re someone who likes puzzles, figuring out how different legal, commercial and technical elements all fit together, then this is a great place to be. And at White & Case, you’ll have opportunities to work on projects all over the world. That global perspective is baked into our culture and our deals, and it creates a really exciting environment to build your career. You do really need to get in there, lift up the bonnet, get stuck into the engine, and play around.

The legislation, spearheaded by Representatives Marcy Kaptur (D-Iowa) and Tracey Mann (R-Kan.) in the House, and Senators Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) in the Senate, seeks to extend the crucial 45Z clean fuel production tax credit and ensure it primarily benefits fuels derived from domestically sourced feedstocks.

The bill, initially introduced in the previous legislative session, has garnered additional support this time around, with Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), and Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.) joining as cosponsors. This bipartisan backing underscores the widespread recognition of the importance of renewable fuels to both the agricultural sector and the nation's energy security.

The 45Z tax credit, a key component of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, currently offers incentives for the production and sale of low-emission transportation fuels. The credit structure provides 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Notably, facilities that adhere to prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements can qualify for significantly higher credit values, reaching up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. This existing credit is slated to remain in effect for the years 2025, 2026, and 2027.

The Farmers First Fuel Incentives Act proposes a significant extension of this vital credit, pushing its expiration date an additional seven years to the end of 2034. This extended timeframe aims to provide greater long-term certainty for biofuel producers and farmers, encouraging further investment and innovation within the sector.

Beyond the extension, a central tenet of the bill is the inclusion of language that would restrict eligibility for the 45Z credit to fuels ""derived from a feedstock which was produced or grown in the United States."" This provision directly addresses concerns about the potential for imported feedstocks to benefit from a tax credit intended to support domestic industries. By prioritizing domestically sourced biomass, the legislation seeks to strengthen American agriculture, create rural economic opportunities, and reduce reliance on foreign inputs.

The reintroduced legislation has already garnered strong support from key industry stakeholders. Organizations such as Growth Energy, the American Soybean Association, the National Oilseed Processors Association, the National Corn Growers Association, the National Sorghum Producers, the U.S. Canola Association, and the Renewable Fuels Association have all voiced their approval.

Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy, emphasized the critical need for long-term certainty provided by the bill, stating, ""Farmers and businesses need to know this tax credit is here to stay before they can feel confident investing in dozens of new energy projects across rural America. With this bill they’ll have the certainty they need to accelerate innovation, create thousands of new jobs, and secure new markets for farmers and biofuel producers."" She further commended Senators Marshall and Klobuchar for their leadership and thanked other rural champions for their efforts.

The reintroduction of the Farmers First Fuel Incentives Act signals a strong commitment from a bipartisan coalition to support the growth of the domestic renewable fuels industry and ensure that American farmers are at the forefront of this burgeoning sector. As the bill moves through the legislative process, it will be closely watched by agricultural producers, biofuel companies, and environmental advocates alike.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-04-11 16:56:37.726822

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Pioneer XCF Global Takes Flight With Ambitious IPO Amid Industry Tailwinds

byVasil Velev

April 10, 2025

3 minute read

XCF Global, a leading player in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market, is preparing for a high-profile IPO in the coming days, seeking to establish a foothold in a market poised for growth both in the U.S. and globally, according to its CEO Mihir Dange.

“We are really just at the inception point of what this market is going to look like over the next 10 years,” Dange said in an exclusive interview. The company’s strategy hinges on securing early-mover advantages in a market expected to grow exponentially as airlines race to meet carbon reduction mandates.

Crucial to XCF’s public debut is its newly inked 15-year agreement with energy company Phillips 66 for both feedstock supply and offtake—a move Dange describes as “a base case model which is mitigated and has upside.” The agreement is designed to ensure operational stability while giving XCF the flexibility to pursue better pricing opportunities. It also allows for flexibility if circumstances change. “We pay for the right to move away from the Phillips 66 relationship if we want to, ” he added.

IRA Uncertainty Casts a Shadow

Despite the momentum, concerns loom over the stability of federal incentives such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The federal producer credits, vital for SAF economics, are set to expire in 2027. “..if federal credits left, there would be some type of state credits helping to push forward,” Dange assured.

In California, once the poster child for green fuel adoption, recent legislative changes have shifted momentum to other states. “We’re seeing a lot of that production actually moving out of the state and going into other states,” Dange observed.

But the company is betting on a shifting landscape across the country, where state-level incentives fill the federal gap. “Nevada is working on AB 481, which is potentially putting two and a half dollars of credits per gallon,” said Dange, emphasizing the importance of local legislation for future viability.

Emerging hubs like Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Washington, and Nevada are positioning themselves with new tax credits and rural development programs. “There are so many different business models that there is not one right answer,” he said, highlighting the industry’s experimental phase.

Still, the potential withdrawal of federal support raises broader questions about whether the reduced support in the U.S. can sustain the industry. “It would be foolish to think that a domestic-only strategy would be the only strategy going forward,” XCF Global’s CEO warns.

International Demand for SAF: Europe Leads, Asia Follows

Globally, the SAF sector is gaining steam. Europe, with its stringent mandates—2% SAF in 2025 scaling up to 70% by 2050—is leading the charge. “You cannot use book and claim to put it into the wing. You have to actually have the molecule into the wing of the plane,” Dange said, underlining Europe’s push for real emissions reductions.

Other regions are quickly catching up. “Japan is looking at a mandate. Australia wants to put a mandate. China has targets,” Dange noted, painting a picture of burgeoning international demand.

CORSIA Demand and XCF’s Expanding Project Pipeline

This pipeline of countries and markets provides certainty for future plans and could tie in nicely with the aviation industry’s main mechanism for SAF adoption – the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

The sector’s adoption of CORSIA standards is creating a baseline of demand for low-carbon aviation fuel. “CORSIA and international mandates…will not change the supply-demand need that more infrastructure has to come up, period” Dange stressed.

Looking ahead, XCF Global plans to leverage its first project’s success to launch additional production facilities. New projects will be shaped by local incentives, feedstock availability, and export opportunities, even involving complex logistics like “moving product from Reno to Europe” if economics allow.

At first glance this is a difficult moment for all carbon mitigating initiatives in the U.S. with various incentives being removed from the board and increasing uncertainty and risk. “That difficulty is also the opportunity that is born in the space,” Mihir Dange concluded.

US tariffs cast a shadow on global gas market

Steel can make up nearly a third of an LNG terminal's pricetag, so the new levies could push up costs and push back start-up dates, writes Xiaoyi Deng London, 11 April (Argus) — US president Donald Trump's volatile tariff policy and some of the countermeasures already announced by large trade partners are unlikely to cause any direct disruption to global gas markets. But they will have a direct impact on future US liquefaction capacity. And the indirect effects on gas supply and demand could be huge, stemming from a weaker macroeconomic outlook, fuel substitution and inflationary pressures on infrastructure development. US LNG developers hailed Trump's return to office, after complaining that his predecessor complicated the issuance of additional export licences. But Trump's imposition of 25pc tariffs on all foreign-sourced steel and aluminum, from 12 March, will increase infrastructure costs in the US' upstream and midstream sectors. These present an immediate risk for US LNG developers, particularly for the five projects under construction and the six others expected to reach final investment decisions (FIDs) this year. Metals account for up to 30pc of the cost of an LNG export plant. A terminal can cost $5bn-25bn to build, depending on its size, with steel used for pipelines, tanks and other structural frameworks. Facilities can be built using some domestically produced metal, but higher prices for this might lead to construction and FID delays for the country's planned liquefaction projects. US tariffs' primary effect on the domestic gas market stems from duties levied on non-energy goods used by the oil and gas industry, including steel and specialised pipeline components such as valves and compressors, which are imported. The US remains a net natural gas importer from Canada , but these flows are unlikely to be affected by trade tariffs, given the lack of alternative supply sources available to some northern US states. Tariff baiting Trump's latest tariff round , unveiled on 2 April, involves a a minimum 10pc on all foreign imports from 5 April,with much higher tariffs on selected countries that briefly came into force on 9 April, before Trump bowed to panic in financial markets and announced a 90-day pause. China is the key exception. It has announced retaliatory tariffs that could disrupt US energy exports, resulting in an escalation that leaves the overall levy at 145pc in the US and 125pc in China. China had already stopped importing US LNG earlier this year. But disruption to trade between the world's two largest economies may weigh heavily on manufacturing activity in China, in turn reducing industrial gas demand. And the ripple effects of disruption to US LPG exports to China may alter fuel-switching economics in the region and beyond. Most other countries in Asia-Pacific have opted not to follow China's lead by retaliating. The Japanese government intends to negotiate a better tariff deal and is considering investing in the US' proposed 20mn t/yr Alaska LNG export project as part of wider efforts to reduce its trade surplus with the US. Countries in Asia-Pacific have been hit with some of the highest of Trump's targeted duties. The EU is keeping retaliatory measures on the table, but these are unlikely to involve US LNG. Europe has become much more reliant on LNG imports after losing the bulk of its Russian pipeline supply, and imposing tariffs on energy imports would only reignite inflationary pressures that European countries have tried to curb over the past three years. The bloc says it is ready to negotiate on possibly increasing its US LNG imports to reduce its trade surplus and would axe tariffs on industrial imports if the US agrees to do the same. But Trump says this is not enough, citing the EU's upcoming Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism as one of the ""unfair trade practices"" that justifies a tariff response.

Q&A: IMO GHG scheme in EU ETS could be 'challenging'

London, 11 April (Argus) — Delegates have approved the global greenhouse gas (GHG) pricing mechanism proposal at the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) 83rd Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting. Argus Media spoke to ministerial adviser and Finland's head representative at the IMO delegation talks, Anita Irmeli, on the sidelines of the London MEPC meeting. What is your initial reaction to the text? We are happy and satisfied about the content of the agreed text, so far. But we need to be careful. This week, all member states were able to vote. But in October, when adaption will take place, only those states which are parties to Marpol Annex VI will be able to vote if indeed a vote is called for, and that changes the situation a little bit. Here when we were voting, a minority was enough — 40 votes. But if or when we vote in October, then we need two thirds of those party to Marpol Annex VI to be in favour of the text. Will enthusiasm for the decision today remain by October? I'm pretty sure it will. But you never know what will happen between now and and the next six months. What is the effect of the decision on FuelEU Maritime and the EU ETS? Both FuelEU Maritime and the EU ETS have a review clause. This review clause states that if we are ambitious enough at the IMO, then the EU can review or amend the regulation. So of course, it is very important that we first consider if the approved Marpol amendments are ambitious enough to meet EU standards. Only after that evaluation, which won't be until well after October, can we consider these possible changes. Do you think the EU will be able to adopt these the text as it stands today? My personal view is that we can perhaps incorporate this text under FuelEU Maritime, but it may be more challenging for the EU ETS, where shipping is now included. What was the impact of US President Donald Trump's letter on the proceedings? EU states were not impacted, but it's difficult to say what the impact was on other states.

Fujairah biofuel uptake lags despite EU rules push

Dubai, 11 April (Argus) — Alternative bunker fuels like biofuels have yet to gain significant traction in the UAE port of Fujairah, the world's third-largest bunkering hub, even though EU regulations such as FuelEU Maritime and the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) are driving demand expectations. Discussions at the S&P Global Commodity Insights FUJCON 2025 this week highlighted a combination of structural and market-driven factors holding back adoption, with limited demand from key vessel types and insufficient infrastructure investment topping the list. The introduction of FuelEU Maritime, which mandates a 2pc reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity for ships calling at EU ports starting this year, alongside the EU ETS carbon pricing mechanism was expected to spur demand for biofuels in Fujairah. Many vessels refueling in the UAE hub transit to Europe, making compliance with these regulations a potential driver for alternative fuel uptake. A key reason cited is the limited presence of containerships and cruise ships in Fujairah's bunkering market. Globally, these vessel types are the primary consumers of biofuels due to their operators' commitments to decarbonisation and customer-driven sustainability demands. Fujairah's bunkering activity is dominated by bulk carriers and tankers, which have been slower to adopt alternative fuels. ""Containerships and cruise ships are leading the charge on biofuels in Singapore and Rotterdam, but they are just not a big part of the mix here,"" said Fujairah harbour master Mayed Alameeri. ""We support the use of green fuels, but without that demand pull, there's little incentive to scale up."" This lack of demand has deterred investments in biofuel storage and supply infrastructure. Unlike in Singapore and Rotterdam, where biofuel bunkering is supported by dedicated facilities, Fujairah's infrastructure remains geared toward conventional fuels. ""There is no single shipowner who has partnered with a supplier in Fujairah on adoption of alternative fuels,"" said Hafnia Bunker general manager Kasper Sorensen. ""It is very difficult to make a business case for investment."" While there have been sporadic inquiries from shipowners over the past year, these have been for small amounts — typically 150-200t — far below the scale needed to spur investment. ""You need steady offtake to justify the capex for tanks and blending,"" a Fujairah supplier said. ""Right now, we're not seeing it."" Market dynamics also play a role. The price spread between biofuels and conventional fuels remains a hurdle, with Fujairah's B24 blend trading at a significant premium to very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO). Mandates need certainty The bunker market is under pressure to decarbonise as the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) targets a 50pc cut in shipping emissions by 2050 from 2008 levels. Alternative fuels are central to this goal, but regulatory disparities complicate investment decisions, industry players said. Regulatory uncertainty adds another layer of caution. While FuelEU's pooling mechanism allows shipowners to offset emissions across fleets, potentially enabling biofuel bunkering in Fujairah to count toward EU compliance, clarity on implementation is limited. Bunker market participants urged the adoption of universal standards for alternative bunker fuels, warning that fragmented regulations are hampering the shift to lower-carbon options. ""Shipowners are still figuring out how to navigate these rules which are regionally divergent,"" said a shipping broker. ""Until there's more certainty, many are sticking with what they know."" Still, some market participants expressed cautious optimism. Rising inquiries, although sporadic, suggest growing awareness of biofuels' role in meeting EU mandates. ""It's not a flood, but it's a trickle that could build,"" said a bunker trader. For now, Fujairah's biofuel market remains in a holding pattern, waiting for demand signals strong enough to shift the hub's bunkering landscape.

Japan's Cosmo starts delivering SAF from Sakai refinery

Tokyo, 11 April (Argus) — Japanese energy firm Cosmo Energy has started supplying domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced at the country's first large-scale SAF plant. This marks the first SAF delivery from the plant housed at refiner Cosmo Oil's Sakai refinery, Cosmo Energy announced on 10 April. Cosmo Energy's subsidiary Cosmo Oil Marketing delivered SAF to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) at the country's western Kansai International Airport on 10 April. The delivered amount should be 15 kilolitres, based on JASDF's public notice for the tender. SAF producing joint venture Saffaire Sky Energy — launched by Cosmo Oil, engineering firm JGC and biodiesel producer Revo International — produces this SAF from used cooking oil (UCO) at the plant. The firms aim to supply around 30,000 kilolitres/yr, and plan to begin delivering SAF to domestic airlines Japan Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA), the US' Delta Air Lines , Finland's Finnair, and German logistics group DHL Express in the 2025 fiscal year starting this April. JASDF's acrobatic flight team Blue Impulse will use the SAF in an exhibition flight scheduled on 13 April, the opening day of Expo 2025, over the event's venue in Osaka. Separately, an explosion occurred at the Sakai refinery on 10 April, but its 100,000 b/d crude distillation unit (CDU) is still operating, according to Cosmo Oil and the local fire department. The fire department received a notice from the refinery's staff that ""an explosion happened at a sulphuric acid regeneration equipment, with no fires or leaks of LPG."" The refinery was heating sulphuric acid for purification when the explosion happened. The SAF plant at the refinery is not affected by the accident, Cosmo said.

But experts say it could be a while before these “eco-fuels” or “e-fuels” – synthetic aviation fuels produced from fossil-free electricity and recycled carbon dioxide – can be a major way to make aviation sustainable.

How to fly green

“There’s a collection of sectors such as aviation, long-distance maritime shipping, chemical industry, steel production – making these sectors sustainable is not as easy as for other sectors, where you can just directly apply electrification,” chemical engineer Maartje Feenstra said.

Feenstra, a senior research consultant at the University of Sydney’s Institute for Sustainable Futures, said batteries were not viable technical solutions for airplanes.

“They don’t provide the right energy density. So that means that for aviation, we have a limited amount of technical possibilities for the energy transition. That means we have to rely on sustainable aviation fuels,” she said.

University of Adelaide researcher Tracey Dodd, a global expert on energy policy, said the aviation industry was lobbying for the right policy environments for sustainable fuels.

“But even with the best projections, it’s only going to be 0.7 per cent of fuel globally,” she said.

“That’s a drop in the ocean. How can we support a sustainable aviation revolution?”

Dodd said the technology existed for a transition to sustainable fuel sources.

“There are several synthetic biofuels that can be used in existing aircraft, meaning there is no need to change the aircraft. Algae also has significant potential, but it is more expensive as the feedstock can be used for other purposes, such as pharmaceutical products. Additionally, scientists are exploring new pathways, including hydrogen and carbon-neutral synthetic fuels,” she said.

“Every day we have a new innovation. The problem is scaling it up.”

What is sustainably produced aviation fuel?

The European Union roadmap for sustainable aviation fuels requires them to make up 2 per cent of European supply by 2025, rising to 6 per cent in 2030 and reaching 70 per cent by 2050.

“The aviation sector, in particular, will rely on sustainably produced kerosene for the time being,” said Roland Dittmeyer from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany.

“Synthetic fuels that are produced by means of power-to-liquid processes with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or biogenic sources, water, and green electricity are particularly suitable.”

Dittmeyer is the spokesperson for the Kopernikus P2X project, which announced advances in sustainable fuel production in March.

KIT, and industrial partner Sunfire, said it had used water vapour and CO2 co-electrolysis technology to produce synthetic kerosene at a scale that could be used industrially.

“It’s nice to see this technology scaling up and getting sort of demonstration volumes,” said Feenstra, who is not involved in Kopernikus P2X.

Sunfire and KIT say it’s a world first. Their “syngas” – a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide that are converted into long-chain hydrocarbons called “syncrude” – has a 220-kilowatt (kW) output.

A Boeing 777’s twin-jet engines have a total power output of about 130,000kW.

“Co-electrolysis stands out, in that it is a highly efficient process that electrochemically converts water vapour and CO2 directly into syngas in a single step,” said Sunfire senior engineer Hubertus Richter.

“Up to 85 per cent of the electrical energy used for this process can be recovered as chemical energy in the syngas.”

Richter said Sunfire could also demonstrate that coupling the process with its co-electrolysis method meant a very high plant availability and reliability – and could potentially produce syngas with the desired quality at any time.

“This eliminates the traditionally separate hydrogen production process with downstream syngas production, significantly increasing the efficiency of the overall process,” he said.

Feenstra helps illustrate Kopernikus P2X’s output another way: “With a daily production of 300 litres of syncrude, it would still take 796 days (over two years) to fill up a Boeing 747-400. For the next envisioned production of a tonne a day, it would still take slightly over half a year to fill up a Boeing 747-400.”

So there’s some way to go yet.

A problem of soaring costs

“The challenge for the aviation industry is that the renewable fuels are more expensive than the normal fuel set. … The more sustainable aviation fuel we require, the more that price difference is going to hurt you,” Feenstra said.

“If we want to make aviation sustainable, we’ll have to enable these fuels in one way or another.”

Dodd has been outspoken in her concerns about “flight shame” – the guilt caused by being a passenger on a CO2-emitting aircraft. While scientists have raised concerns about global tourism emissions, Dodd said the issues should be tackled collectively.

People “shouldn’t necessarily have to stop doing what we love doing and what makes the world tick. We just need to be really innovative about how we can move forward”, she said.

“I think that we need to pay great attention to the challenges of decarbonising aviation,” she said.

“I understand that decarbonising the electricity system must be a priority, but we also need to consider sustainable aviation fuels to ensure it receives the necessary business and policy support.

“Aviation is a particularly hard-to-abate sector, and everyone I know in the industry is deeply committed to making progress. I want to support and encourage their efforts … it’s important to address both electricity and aviation decarbonisation.”

Dodd said one possibility would be to encourage businesses and universities that used long-distance travel to invest in sustainable aviation fuels.

“[That would mean] businesses being aware of and paying attention to how impacted their supply chain is by aviation and how – for us to move forward – that perhaps they could be supporting and partnering the airlines to scale up commercial availability of sustainable aviation field,” she said.

“You want to ensure that we’re doing this in a way that is economically sensitive and that it won’t price certain people out of the market for flying, or for goods like flowers and coffee that we ship.”",https://wp.thenewdaily.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1743638332-pexels-refuelplane.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,N,,2025-04-11 09:57:12.891883

US President Donald Trump’s tariff plans, particularly on imported vehicles, sparked concern over the effects of the tariffs on such purchases, and subsequently diesel demand growth.

Furthermore, data released by the Department for Energy Security revealed that the UK’s crude oil production rose for the third consecutive month during January, reaching the highest levels since May 2023.

Meanwhile, data also highlighted that the UK’s consumption of refined petroleum products declined by 2% compared to the year prior, with diesel demand falling by 12,250 barrels per day from December 2024’s levels.

Sterling appreciated from US$1.270 to US$1.291 throughout March, reaching a four-month high as uncertainty dominated US markets. Trump’s global tariff plans sparked concerns over the potential impacts of higher prices on demand growth as the President pledged to implement trade tariffs on imports from all US trading partners.

By mid-month, market attention turned to key monetary policy decisions whereby both the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 4.5% and in the range of 4.25-4.5%, respectively.

By month-end, sterling traded within the US$1.29-US$1.30 range following the UK Spring Budget, which revealed government spending cuts of £3.6 billion to adhere to fiscal rules. As sterling strengthened against the US dollar throughout March, UK wholesale diesel became marginally cheaper by 0.74ppl.

Wholesale UK renewable diesel (HVO) prices rose from 106ppl to 112ppl (excluding duty and Renewable Transport Fuel Certificate (RTFC) benefit) during March, underpinned by increasing cost pressures amid feedstock prices rising to three-year highs, particularly for used cooking oil (UCO).

Supply-side concerns mounted as markets awaited guidance by the Indonesian government on UCO export restrictions after it issued regulations to curb exports earlier in the year.

From mid-month, the UK initiated an anti-dumping investigation into HVO imports from the US following a request from several stakeholders on reports that the price cap had narrowed and HVO may now be directly competing with UK-produced biodiesel.

Furthermore, a feasibility study of conversion of Grangemouth oil refinery to a renewable fuel facility was carried out by EY on behalf of the UK government. It presented nine projects that could be integrated, with one proposal being a sustainable aviation fuel and HVO plant, costing £800 million. An outline of final recommendations is expected to be published soon.

In other news, North Ayrshire council has transitioned thirty-six refuse collection vehicles from diesel to HVO to support Scottish Government sustainability goals that include phasing out new diesel or petrol vehicles in public sector fleets by 2030. Reports suggested that the council’s transition could save around 2,529 tonnes of carbon emissions over 12 months.

Furthermore, Neste delivered its first load of HVO to a cruise terminal in Singapore, kickstarting Singapore’s path to decarbonisation amid various industry goals to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. In the European market, Aral has started offering HVO at two new filling stations in Germany to supply the HGV sector.

The cost of blending biodiesel to UK B7 specification rose from 6.9ppl to 7.1ppl throughout March. The cost of Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) compliance rose as the cost of FAME-10 increased by approximately 2% across the month.

In addition, RTFCs rose from 25 pence to 27 pence per certificate, thus increasing the benefit for HVO consumers (assuming 100% of the RTFC benefit is passed on the end-user).",https://www.route-one.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/04/Portland-column-April-2025-2.jpg,N,,2025-04-11 08:56:49.187839

The 2024/25 Net Zero Report, based on a survey of sustainability leaders from 350 financial firms across 13 countries, highlights that 72% of institutions have no plans to reduce fossil fuel investments over the next decade.

At the same time, 44% intend to increase their exposure to low-carbon assets, and nearly 80% are more inclined to fund companies with clear climate transition plans.

According to Dr. Daniel Klier, CEO of South Pole, the findings underscore a troubling paradox: “Financial institutions want to have their cake and eat it too.”

He added that while financiers are ramping up climate-related engagement with their portfolio companies, they continue to fund fossil fuels, walking “a tightrope” between long-term climate goals and short-term investor returns.

Unclear regulation remains a major obstacle, with 47% of respondents citing it as a barrier to achieving net zero targets.

Despite these challenges, 86% of institutions say they are on track or partially on track to meet their commitments, and 88% expect to increase engagement with portfolio companies on decarbonization within the next two years.

Dame Inga Beale, Chair of South Pole’s Board, noted that insurance companies are emerging as leaders in this transition.

“Those who proactively manage risk today will be better positioned for success tomorrow,” she said, highlighting stricter decarbonization standards in the insurance sector.

“Many potential suppliers didn’t grasp the size of our event. Some offered rough estimations, but we wanted a more granular, evidence-based approach,” said Lindsay.

GCS first mission was to calculate the emissions generated by visitor travel to and from the airshow, and using the GCS Visitor Travel Carbon Calculator, Farnborough International was able to target its audience directly for the first time.

The tool was integrated into the registration process, and attendees were invited to receive a personalised carbon footprint report in exchange for sharing their travel data.

According to Lindsay, GCS’s engagement with key suppliers such as catering and transport has saved both time and resources.

The air show display is also something being factored in as the operation teams have provided fuel data, confirming that all display aircrafts are powered by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), supplied by the TAG-owned Farnborough Airport.

Additionally, Farnborough International’s Destination Zero campaign aims to achieve net zero emissions by embedding sustainability across four strategic pillars, (1. Energy 2.

World revenue for the Biofuel Industry Market is set to surpass US$138.97 billion in 2025.

Government Policies and Regulatory Support

Governments worldwide are implementing policies and incentives to encourage biofuel production and adoption as part of their efforts to reduce carbon emissions and achieve energy security. Mandates such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in the U.S. and the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) in the European Union have set minimum blending requirements for biofuels in transportation fuels. Additionally, tax credits, subsidies, and carbon pricing mechanisms are making biofuels a more attractive alternative to fossil fuels.

For example, the U.S. government provides a biodiesel tax credit of $1 per gallon, benefiting companies such as Renewable Energy Group (REG) and Valero Energy Corporation, which produce and distribute biodiesel and renewable diesel. Similarly, Neste, a Finland-based company, is expanding its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in response to EU regulations promoting the use of biofuels in aviation.

Feedstock Supply Constraints and Competition with Food Production

One of the most pressing challenges in the biofuel industry is the limited availability of sustainable feedstocks. First-generation biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, primarily rely on corn, sugarcane, soy, and palm oil, leading to concerns over food security and land use conflicts. The expansion of biofuel production in regions like Brazil, Indonesia, and the U.S. has sparked debates about deforestation, biodiversity loss, and rising food prices.

As governments push for higher biofuel blending targets, competition between food and fuel markets intensifies. For example, Indonesia's biodiesel program has driven up palm oil demand, impacting food prices and contributing to deforestation. Similarly, ethanol production in the U.S. has raised concerns over corn availability for food and livestock feed. To overcome this challenge, the industry must diversify feedstock sources, focusing on waste-based, cellulosic, and algae-based biofuels. However, these alternatives require significant investments in technology and infrastructure, delaying large-scale commercialization.

That slightly outpaces the Gulfstream G700 , which tops out at Mach 0.935. While both are leaders in the ultra-long-range jet category, Bombardier has claimed the crown for speed - a defining factor for time-sensitive operators and elite business travelers.

Speed is a critical factor for many business jet customers. A few minutes saved per leg adds up over transcontinental operations. High cruise speeds improve scheduling flexibility, reduce fatigue on long-haul missions, and appeal to very busy executives. In our article, we will compare the Global 8000 and G700’s speed capabilities, examine the technology behind them, and assess what it means for their market positioning.

Performance By The Numbers: Bombardier Global 8000 vs Gulfstream G700

The Bombardier Global 8000 cruises at Mach 0.94 and offers a maximum range of 8,000 nautical miles (14,816 kilometers). Its GE Passport engines balance high thrust with efficiency. In comparison, the Gulfstream G700 reaches Mach 0.935 and can fly up to 7,750 nautical miles (14,353 kilometers), using Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 engines. Both jets feature advanced aerodynamics and support for sustainable aviation fuel.

Neither aircraft currently has multiple variants. The Global 8000 was derived from the Global 7500 platform, achieving performance gains through aerodynamic enhancements and software updates. Gulfstream has opted to reserve upgrades for its upcoming G800 while continuing to refine the G700 as its premier offering.

According to Bombardier's official website, the Global 8000 is the fastest non-military jet after the Concorde:

“Our Global 8000 is the world’s fastest civilian aircraft since Concorde with a top speed of Mach 0.94 and the only business jet with four true living spaces and a range of 8000 nautical miles to take you faster, farther and in greater comfort than anything else in business aviation.”

The Global 8000 also made headlines during certification testing in 2021 by achieving a whooping Mach 1.015 in a dive, which was confirmed by a NASA F-18 chase plane, validating its structural integrity and high-speed capability. Gulfstream has also extensively tested the G700, aiming for full customer deliveries this year.

Specifications: Gulfstream G700 vs Bombardier Global 8000

How The Global 8000 Achieves This Performance

The Global 8000’s impressive speed is possible thanks to its aerodynamic wing design and efficient GE Passport turbofans. The aircraft also features the Vision flight deck and Bombardier’s Pũr Air system, contributing to a low cabin altitude and high comfort without sacrificing performance.

To reach Mach 0.94, the Global 8000 typically cruises much higher than commercial airliners, between 41,000 and 45,000 feet. Top speeds are most achievable under lighter load conditions, with fuel and payload optimized for long-haul missions in favorable atmospheric conditions.

There are trade-offs. High-speed operations require precise flight planning and elevated maintenance demands. The increased performance also comes with a higher purchase price and requires strict adherence to operational envelopes for noise and wear limitations.

How Bombardier Global 8000 Compares To Gulfstream G700 and Other Competing Aircraft

While the Global 8000 narrowly claims the title for top speed, the Gulfstream G700 brings a range of advantages that appeal to different priorities. The G700 features five customizable living zones - one more than the Global 8000, offering unparalleled in-flight comfort and privacy. It also has a larger cabin with 100% fresh air replenished every two to three minutes and a low cabin altitude of just 4,850 feet at 41,000 feet cruise.

The G700’s Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 engines also contribute to its smooth and quiet operation, giving it an edge in passenger experience. Its Symmetry Flight Deck with active control sidesticks enhances pilot ergonomics and safety. The G700 also has advanced cabin technologies like circadian lighting to minimize jet lag. G700 can also fly at speeds close to the sound barrier while maintaining a relaxing onboard environment.

With its 2024 entry into service, it’s arriving just slightly ahead of Bombardier’s latest model, which gives Gulfstream a slight head start in the market. Several celebrities, including Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, have already purchased this aircraft. Future rivals like the Dassault Falcon 10X and Gulfstream’s G800 are expected to continue pushing the envelope. Still, the G700 is firmly positioned as the premier choice for those who value cabin experience and overall luxury as much as speed.

Speed plays a vital role in charter operations, VIP transport, government, and military use. Operators can cut crucial minutes on intercontinental routes such as Singapore–Los Angeles or London–Hong Kong.

The Global 8000’s cruise capability makes it ideal for missions where time and endurance matter. The G700, while slightly slower, is often favored for its spacious layout and smooth ride, especially for ultra-long-haul comfort. The G700’s maximum range allows nonstop missions like Dubai–New York or Hong Kong–London. Its large cabin and low cabin altitude reduce jet lag, making it a strong choice for luxury charter companies and elite government operations. Military operators could potentially be interested in acquiring a new G700 as well, judging by the immense popularity of previous Gulfstream aircraft among Air Forces worldwide for VIP transport and as a spy plane.

Gulfstream promotes the G700 as ideal for non-stop travel between virtually any two cities worldwide, and operators choose this jet for its reliability, rapid dispatch, and smooth ride in premium flight planning.

Airline Adoption And Feedback

Bombardier has already attracted a roster of elite clients, including government delegations, multinational corporations, and VIP charter services. Many early Global 8000 orders are upgrades from the Global 7500, signaling customer trust. The launch customer for the brand-new Bombardier is one of the world’s largest private jet rental companies – NetJets, which has already placed an order for four aircraft. NetJets is also a key client using Global 7500.

Operators have praised its quiet interior, low cabin altitude, and stable handling at high altitudes. While full operational feedback will expand following the 2025 entry into service, initial impressions suggest Bombardier’s promises are becoming a reality.

Meanwhile, the Gulfstream G700 has been embraced by key clients, including Qatar Executive (a business jet charter branch of Qatar Airways), Flexjet, and private owners worldwide. Feedback highlights its cabin comfort, advanced avionics, and performance on long-haul sectors. Gulfstream has reported strong interest and order backlogs, with operators particularly praising the G700’s smooth handling and innovative cockpit design.

The Story Behind the Aircraft's Development

The Global 8000 was conceived during a period of post-pandemic resurgence in business aviation, when speed, range, and health-conscious features gained new prominence.

Bombardier built on the Global 7500’s success, launching the Global 8000 in 2022 with upgraded aerodynamics and cabin innovations. Development stayed largely in-house, with certification milestones achieved using the same test fleet.

Meanwhile, the Gulfstream G700 was announced in 2019 as a direct response to growing demand for ultra-long-range, high-performance jets. It was built on the proven and well-tested G650 platform but stretched to accommodate more cabin space. It was integrated with next-generation technology, including the Symmetry Flight Deck and advanced fly-by-wire systems. The G700 also introduced Gulfstream’s Predictive Landing Performance System and SmartView Synthetic Vision, improving safety and situational awareness. Gulfstream targeted operators who prioritize comfort, operational range, and speed, positioning the G700 as its flagship. The aircraft completed its maiden flight in early 2020 and has undergone an extensive test campaign with multiple prototypes.

What Comes Next?

Interior upgrades, new tech packages, and potential cabin re-configurations will likely follow as the Global 8000 enters service. Though no new variants have been announced, software improvements and connectivity enhancements are on the roadmap.

Other prominent competitors like the Falcon 10X and Gulfstream G800 could shift the competitive balance, but it will take significant innovations to match the Global 8000’s Mach 0.94 mark.

Malaysia's strategic positioning as the current chair of ASEAN presents a unique opportunity to drive regional sustainability initiatives.","KUALA LUMPUR 11 April - Malaysia's strategic pivot towards becoming a regional Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) hub, as prominently discussed at the recent Airbus Industry Outreach, presents a complex yet promising narrative.

An in-depth analysis reveals a nation leveraging its abundant resources and proactive policies, but also confronting significant logistical and technological challenges.

The pivotal question remains: can Malaysia effectively harness collaborative innovation, particularly through its strengthened alliance with Airbus and its long-term strategic vision, to realize its ambitious SAF goals?

In a landmark move to revolutionize the skies, aerospace giant Airbus and the Aerospace Malaysia Innovation Centre (AMIC) have inked a cutting-edge research and technology deal aimed at powering up the SAF supply chain across the Asia-Pacific region.

This collaboration, as highlighted during the Airbus Industry Outreach, underscores the strategic importance of Malaysia in the region's sustainable aviation future.

Airbus's strategic endorsement of Malaysia's potential, encapsulated in their statement, ""We see huge potential here in Malaysia,"" underscores the nation's burgeoning role in regional sustainability. This aligns seamlessly with Airbus Chief Sustainability Officer Julie Kitcher's overarching vision.

Interviewed by DagangNews following the Airbus Industry Outreach event in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday, Kitcher articulated: ""Our primary focus is to ramp up those aircraft, so that our airlines can take delivery of those most fuel efficient planes in support of their competitiveness."" This dual emphasis on production efficiency and sustainability is central to Airbus's strategy.

Kitcher's insights shed light on Airbus's approach to balancing production demands with sustainability goals. Addressing supply chain challenges post-COVID, she noted, ""We delivered 766 aircraft last year, so the ramp up is progressing and this year our guidance is to deliver around 820 commercial aircraft.""

This focus on delivering fuel-efficient aircraft directly supports the industry's net-zero 2050 goal, as these planes represent the ""first lever to that sustainability goal.""

Furthermore, Kitcher outlined Airbus's comprehensive sustainability priorities, encompassing internal emission reductions and industry-wide targets. ""We have a number of priorities for our own company, so to reduce our scope one and scope two emissions by 63% by 2030,"" she stated, emphasizing the company's commitment to reducing its environmental footprint.

These internal targets, coupled with the industry-wide goal of ""improving the CO2 intensity of our aircraft delivered by 46% by 2035,"" underscore Airbus's holistic approach to sustainability.

When asked on the Airbus-AMIC collaboration, Kitcher explained, ""The signing ceremony that just took place with AMIC is basically to research the potential of feedstock in Malaysia, so the different types of feedstock, the different locations of feedstock and their suitability for conversion into sustainable aviation fuel under the sustainability criteria as defined by ICAO.""

This research-driven partnership is crucial for Malaysia, facilitating a deeper understanding of its feedstock resources and optimizing the SAF supply chain.

Adding to this context, speaking to DagangNews, Emeritus Professor Tan Sri Dr. Zakri Abdul Hamid, Chairman of AMIC, provided further insight into the long-standing relationship with Airbus and the strategic importance of the collaboration.

""Well, you must realise we had a very long history with Airbus, we have been in this country for 40 years,"" he stated, emphasizing the established partnership.

He highlighted the research focus, stating, ""This research is to explore the prospect of SAF in this part of the world,"" and underscored Malaysia's unique advantage, ""Because we are a highly biodiverse country.""

Dr. Zakri also emphasized the specific research team involved: ""One of the lead researchers is Distinguished Professor Dr. Phang Siew Moi from USCI University with Leong Sat Sing Vice President, Group Sustainability Office and also some others."" He acknowledged the economic realities of SAF production, stating,

""There's one conditionality still very expensive to produce, so maybe 2030 and beyond, but the roadmap is there, so this is where we are to go.”

He also highlighted the magnitude of the project, stating, ""This is a bigger one, bigger money at about three million ringgit and all that.""

This long-term perspective highlights the strategic nature of the collaboration, focusing on building a sustainable SAF industry for the future.

However, a critical analysis continues to expose a pressing supply-demand disparity. While Malaysia boasts significant SAF feedstock resources, the current availability of key components, such as used cooking oil, falls considerably short of projected demand.

This necessitates a strategic diversification of feedstock sources and a robust scaling of collection infrastructures.

Furthermore, the geographic distribution of these resources, predominantly concentrated in Sabah, Sarawak, and Johor, presents intricate logistical challenges that demand meticulous planning and substantial investment.

The success of Malaysia's SAF strategy is inextricably linked to its ability to overcome these logistical and technological hurdles through collaborative innovation.

This is precisely where the reinforced research and technology cooperation agreement between Airbus and AMIC becomes pivotal, now further clarified by both Kitcher's and Dr. Zakri's insights.

Earlier in her speech at the Outreach event, Kitcher said, ""Decarbonising aviation at speed and scale requires bold action and collaboration across sectors – from airlines, manufacturers and airports to regulators, governments and investors.""

This collaboration is vital for Malaysia, facilitating knowledge and technology transfer, and strengthening the nation's SAF production capacity.

Notably, the Airbus-AMIC partnership prioritizes feedstocks and pathways validated under the ICAO-CORSIA framework, ensuring alignment with internationally recognized sustainability standards.

A strategic analysis of the global SAF market reveals a complex landscape characterized by a current supply surplus, largely due to the high cost of SAF.

However, long-term projections indicate a surge in demand, necessitating immediate investment in new SAF projects.

To navigate this landscape, Malaysia must implement a proactive policy framework that incentivizes investment and fosters a level playing field.

""Innovation, technology is on track to achieve progress towards these goals,"" Kitcher asserts, underscoring the necessity of a supportive regulatory environment.

Malaysia's strategic positioning as the current chair of ASEAN presents a unique opportunity to drive regional sustainability initiatives.

This leadership role, coupled with its abundant natural resources, proactive policies, and strategic collaborations like the one with Airbus and AMIC, positions Malaysia to become a key player in the global SAF market.

By addressing the current challenges and fostering strategic partnerships, Malaysia can transform its ambitious SAF goals into a tangible economic and environmental reality, ensuring a sustainable future for its aviation sector and beyond.",http://www.dagangnews.com/sites/default/files/articles/Photo-%20Signing%20Ceremony.jpeg,N,,2025-04-11 02:56:26.065070

In this work, we introduce a new methodology to combine the available methods to predict the properties of complex hydrocarbon mixtures such as aviation fuels. Due to the complexity of aviation fuels, the available methods perform well individually on some of the experimental observations and vice versa on others when a surrogate aviation fuel is defined and used. To this end, we introduce a new ensemble model based on the existing methods that combine and weigh their predictions. We employ the probabilistic Bayesian approach to predict aviation fuel properties with confidence levels. This is necessary because the available experimental data for aviation fuels is generally limited, which leads to overfitting. We adopt both “interpretable” Bayesian regression and a more “black-box” approach to Bayesian neural networks. An ensemble of predictive methods provided better predictions than the individual methods with robust confidence levels for three properties considered: mass density, kinematic viscosity, and flash point. A significant reduction in the mean absolute percentage error was obtained for mass density predictions, from 1.25% to 0.57% and 0.42%, using the Bayesian linear regression (BLR) and Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), respectively. The error in kinematic viscosity predictions was reduced from 17.25% to 9.02% and 6.79% using BLR and BNN, respectively. The error in flash point predictions is reduced from 9.04% to 5.83% by BLR and to 5.51% by BNN. The importance of the methods in the ensemble did not fully follow their individual performance, where the accurate models may not be the most important. The ensemble approach allows for the inclusion of new methods, even if they are slightly less accurate. This methodology can be extended to predict other aviation fuel properties and incorporate any predictive model. It also offers a way to generate valid training data for generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, helping to address the scarcity of aviation fuel data.",https://cdn.ssrn.com/ssrn-global-header/11589acb53bc518aa22929bf19add113.svg,N,,2025-04-11 03:56:19.280938

The report highlights Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam as having strong potential to produce SAF using feedstocks such as rice straw, cassava, and forestry residues. These low-carbon sources offer a viable path for the region to support greener aviation while boosting export potential.

By 2040, Indonesia and Vietnam could become key SAF exporters due to their cost-effective supply chains, while Japan and South Korea are expected to emerge as major importers within the region.

Unlike traditional biofuels, SAF can power modern aircraft with up to a 50% blend, without the need for infrastructure changes. It can cut aviation-related carbon emissions by as much as 80% over its lifecycle, depending on the feedstock used.

The study also emphasised that increased SAF production doesn’t require more land. Instead, mechanisation, better irrigation, and crop optimisation can enhance feedstock supply without contributing to deforestation.

Beyond the environmental benefits, the SAF industry is poised to bring economic and social gains—from job creation and skills development to promoting gender equality and opportunities for marginalised communities.

The next phase will focus on policy development, infrastructure investment, and industry partnerships to build a thriving SAF ecosystem in the region.

Sens. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Reps. Marcy Kaptur, D-Iowa, and Tracey Mann, R-Kan., on April 10 reintroduced legislation that aims to extend the 45Z clean fuel production credit and limit eligibility for the credit to renewable fuels made from domestically sourced feedstocks.

The bill, titled the Farmer First Fuel Incentives Act, was previously introduced in both the House and Senate last year. Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; Deb Fischer, R-Neb.; Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich.; Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., and Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., have signed on to cosponsor the current version of the bill.

The 45Z tax credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provides a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels. The credit starts at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit is up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. The tax credit is currently in place for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

The Farmer First Fuel Incentives Act aims to extend the credit for an additional seven years, through the end of 2034. The bill also aims to add language to 45Z regulations limiting credit eligibility to fuel “derived from a feedstock which was produced or grown in the United States.”

The legislation is supported by Growth Energy, American Soybean Association, National Oilseed Processors Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Sorghum Producers, U.S. Canola Association, and Renewable Fuels Association.

“Farmers and businesses need to know this tax credit is here to stay before they can feel confident investing in dozens of new energy projects across rural America. With this bill they’ll have the certainty they need to accelerate innovation, create thousands of new jobs, and secure new markets for farmers and biofuel producers,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “We applaud Sen. Marshall and Sen. Klobuchar for their leadership and thank all our rural champions for working to put American renewable fuel producers and farmers in the best possible position to succeed in next generation fuel markets.”

The American Coalition for Ethanol is urging swift and science-based implementation of the 45Z credit.
Growth Energy called on Treasury to implement changes that would unleash U.S. energy production and unlock investments needed to restore the rural economy.
“With the §45Z credit already in effect, the clean fuels industry appreciates clarity on related implementation issues through either guidance and/or rulemaking,” Clean Fuels wrote.
Clean Fuels asks that Treasury and Congress level the playing field for farmers and fuel producers, supporting continued growth and innovation in domestic energy production.”","Representatives of the U.S. biofuels industry on April 10 submitted comments to the U.S. Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service providing recommendations on how to best implement upcoming 45Z clean fuel production credit regulations.

The Section 45Z credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act, aims to incentivize the production of transportation fuels with lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions levels below certain levels. It provides a per-gallon (or gallon-equivalent) tax credit for producers of clean transportation fuels based on the CI of production.

The credit is currently in place for 2025-2027. For facilities that meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the credit is up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuel and up to $1.75 per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The base credit for facilities that do not meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements is 20 cents per gallon and 35 cents per gallon, respectively.

Treasury and the IRS in January published a notice of intent to propose 45Z regulations and a notice providing the annual emission rate table for the credit. Public comment periods on both notices were open through April 10.

The Renewable Fuels Association stressed that 45Z regulations need clarity, certainty and stability. “If properly implemented, the 45Z tax credit has the potential to advance U.S. energy security, prioritize domestic energy resources, strengthen rural economies, and create a transformative incentive for the adoption of new technologies in the renewable fuels and agriculture sectors,” wrote Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. “The technology-neutral intent of 45Z represents the most economically efficient and environmentally responsible approach to boosting U.S. energy production. However, for the 45Z program to truly drive innovation and value creation in the marketplace, Treasury must move expeditiously to propose, finalize, and promulgate implementing regulations. Clean fuel producers, including RFA’s members, are in desperate need of clarity, certainty, and stability in the regulatory framework supporting the 45Z tax credit.”

Cooper added that RFA believes the final 45Z regulations must recognize the realities of today’s biorefining and agriculture sectors and the complexities of our nation’s transportation fuels marketplace. At the same time, final regulations must maintain an intuitive and manageable approach to registration, reporting, and recordkeeping that creates the kind of dependable value that empowers businesses to invest.

The American Coalition for Ethanol is urging swift and science-based implementation of the 45Z credit. “The 45Z credit not only promotes U.S. energy security … but can also create good-paying jobs and unlock new markets for farmers and domestic biofuel producers,” wrote Brian Jennings, CEO of ACE.

ACE’s comments explain that the value of U.S. corn production has fallen, and input costs have risen. The group cites National Corn Growers Association data that farmers are forecast to experience their third consecutive year of net profit losses in 2025, projected to lose more than $160 per acre on average.

“Treasury should rapidly finalize 45Z guidance and include the technical guidelines for biofuel crops and carbon intensity calculator developed by USDA in the final 45Z rules, so ethanol producers and farmers can unlock new market opportunities,” Jennings added.

Growth Energy called on Treasury to implement changes that would unleash U.S. energy production and unlock investments needed to restore the rural economy. “The Trump administration has an important opportunity to give farmers and biofuel producers the freedom and flexibility to dominate clean fuel markets around the world and ensure that America wins the global race for the future of the skies,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “The previous administration passed on making 45Z an economic engine for rural America, but this U.S. Treasury could unleash billions of dollars of investment in America’s farm economy. We’re grateful to the Trump administration for taking a fresh look at 45Z, and we urge regulators to move quickly to restore our competitive edge across the heartland.”

Clean Fuels Alliance America urged Treasury to ensure a level playing field for U.S. farmers and adhere to legislative language indicating that co-processed fuels do not apply for the credit. “With the §45Z credit already in effect, the clean fuels industry appreciates clarity on related implementation issues through either guidance and/or rulemaking,” Clean Fuels wrote.

Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs at Clean Fuels, added, “Biofuels are essential to U.S. farm security. The unfinished rules for the Clean Fuel Production Credit are creating intolerable uncertainty for U.S. farmers and biodiesel and renewable diesel producers, putting jobs, economic opportunity, and growth in domestic energy production at risk. Clean Fuels asks that Treasury and Congress level the playing field for farmers and fuel producers, supporting continued growth and innovation in domestic energy production.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/epm/posts/web/2022/11/TreasurySeal_16679557681421.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 20:56:31.382221

The aviation industry is developing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to reduce its carbon emissions. Among potential feedstocks, Euglena gracilis-derived wax ester is promising because of its high short-chain fatty acid content, which lowers its freezing point for aviation applications. Under anaerobic conditions, E. gracilis converts intracellular paramylon into wax esters via fermentation. However, the conversion of paramylon to wax ester is influenced by CO2 availability, medium composition, and external carbon sources; hence, extensive investigations are warranted. This study evaluated the effects of CO2 purging, medium composition and pH, and glucose supplementation on wax ester biosynthesis under dark–anoxic conditions. Results demonstrated that CO2 purging increased wax ester productivity by 37% compared to that under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, HUTNER medium at pH 3 yielded the highest wax ester concentration (1.35 g/L), highlighting the importance of medium composition and pH. Furthermore, glucose supplementation combined with CO2 purging enhanced the overall carbon flux, achieving a wax ester titer of 4.44 g/L. These findings provide new insights into wax ester metabolism in E. gracilis and suggest effective strategies for enhancing anaerobic wax ester biosynthesis. Further research on cost-effective carbon sources, such as food byproducts, is essential to replace glucose and improve the commercial feasibility of Euglena-derived SAF.",https://cdn.ssrn.com/ssrn-global-header/11589acb53bc518aa22929bf19add113.svg,N,,2025-04-10 20:56:47.530927

As part of that agreement, Orbital will pilot the use of its carbon-filtering material at one of AWS' partner data centers in 2025.","“We are excited to partner with Civo to deploy our carbon removal technology for data centers which will help the data center industry transition to a more sustainable future. Our partnership with Civo will accelerate the development of our data center decarbonization and efficiency technologies,” said Jonathan Godwin, CEO and co-founder of Orbital.

The initial deployment is expected to be deployed at an undisclosed UK data center by the end of 2025. In addition, Civo will provide Orbital access to a high performance compute cluster with H200 Nvidia GPUs to support its AI model training, which is integral in the development of its carbon removal technology.

“With the growing investment in UK data centers and the UK government’s AI action plan, we must implement solutions now to reduce the environmental impact of the UK’s expanding data center capacity,” said Mark Boost, CEO of Civo.

Civo currently has two operational data centers in the UK in London and Swindon. In addition, last December, it launched its second UK cloud region in collaboration with Deep Green.

Orbital has already developed a number of proprietary technologies for the data center market out of their research facility in Princeton, New Jersey, US. This includes dual-use chillers, that provide data center level heat ejection then use the waste heat to capture CO2, and extreme liquid cooling.

In order to develop its products, Orbital uses AI to support the testing and development of advanced materials and climate technologies. As part of this, it has developed a carbon-filtering substance for use in data centers, that acts like a sponge at the atomic level and is able to interact with CO2 and sequester it from the atmosphere.

According to the company, it has already achieved a 10x improvement in the performance of the material through the use of its AI platform.

The pilot project with Civo follows a similar agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS) signed in December. As part of that agreement, Orbital will pilot the use of its carbon-filtering material at one of AWS' partner data centers in 2025. In addition, the deal permitted Orbital to use AWS technology to test more AI-generated materials to address water use and chip cooling in the data center sector.

Microsoft backs SAF

In other news, Microsoft announced it had signed a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) purchase agreement with International Airlines Group (IAG) to reduce its Scope 3 lifecycle emissions from business travel and air freight.

The agreement is a five-year extension on a previous deal and will see Microsoft co-fund an additional 39,000 tons of SAF. In addition to offsetting CO2 related to its corporate travel, the purchase intends to cover SAF used by IAG airlines to ship data center components.

“We are taking our collaboration with IAG further, extending our SAF purchase agreement to bring Microsoft closer to our goal of being carbon negative by 2030, while ensuring a multi-year commitment to help drive greater SAF production,” said Julia Fidler, environmental sustainability fuel and materials decarbonization lead at Microsoft.

The SAF used will be produced from used cooking oil and food waste at Phillips 66’s UK-based Humberside refinery, and from sustainably sourced bioethanol at Georgia-based LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels.

IAG is the parent company of airlines including Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, and LEVEL.",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/Lab_team_synthesizing_AI-designed.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 19:56:55.118454

There’s a race on between the skies and the seas—and it’s not about who gets there first, but who gets to fuel the trip.

As both the aviation and maritime shipping industries ramp up plans to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, one thing has become crystal clear: biofuel won’t be enough for both.

That’s not just a guess. It’s backed by modeling from DNV, commissioned by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which shows shipping alone could need up to 7.8 exajoules of biofuel annually by 2050—almost double the global supply of biofuels produced today.

Aviation’s Advantage: Less Choice, More Cash

Airlines don’t have a lot of wiggle room. Unlike ships, planes can’t carry bulky batteries or store massive amounts of fuel without serious trade-offs in weight and space.

That’s why aviation has leaned hard into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—a type of biofuel rebranded with greener marketing. But SAF is still just biofuel, with the same production hurdles and environmental concerns that come with scaling it up.

According to the Clean Air Task Force (CATF), even if global production of sustainable biofuels triples by 2030—as optimistically projected by the International Energy Agency (IEA)—it would only cover 69% of aviation’s energy needs in 2030, and drop to 52% by 2050.

In other words, aviation is already facing a shortfall, even if it hoards every drop.

Bill Ayer, former CEO of Alaska Air Group, emphasized the importance of sustainable biofuels: “Sustainable biofuels are key to aviation's future.”

Maritime Shipping Needs to Change Course

So where does that leave shipping?

The marine sector is lucky in one way—it’s more flexible. Unlike planes, ships have room to play with bulkier fuel systems and heavier engines. This opens the door for fuels that aren’t practical in aviation but might work at sea.

One standout option: ammonia.

Ammonia isn’t new—it’s used all over the world in fertilizer production—but it's gaining traction as a low-carbon marine fuel. It can be used in both purpose-built and modified internal combustion engines. Some ports already store and handle it, which makes infrastructure upgrades more feasible.

The kicker? Ammonia is made from hydrogen and nitrogen, both widely available. That makes its production more scalable compared to biofuels, which rely on limited feedstocks like soy, corn, or crop waste.

Still, ammonia isn’t a free pass. Managing reactive nitrogen losses and ensuring safe fuel handling will be critical if it's going to become a mainstream shipping fuel.

Søren Toft, CEO of MSC, expressed skepticism about biofuels for maritime use: “In my opinion the biofuels should go to the aeroplanes, not the ships, because we get a much better climate impact from that.”

>> In Other News: [x](x)

Not Just a Fuel Issue—It’s a Policy One Too

All this is happening as the IMO prepares to finalize new decarbonization rules for the global shipping industry. Delegates at the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 83) meeting in London are expected to adopt a fuel carbon intensity standard and a pricing mechanism for maritime GHG emissions.

If the IMO assumes that shipping can count heavily on biofuels, they’re missing the bigger picture.

The entire global supply of sustainable biofuels may not even be enough to meet aviation’s needs. Expecting that there’ll be leftovers for shipping isn’t just unrealistic—it’s dangerous planning.

Jonathan Lewis, an expert at CATF, put it bluntly: “A carbon intensity standard for the maritime sector that assumes significant access to biofuels is destined to fail.”

Time to Invest Elsewhere

Maritime companies and policymakers have some tough decisions to make. But they also have an opportunity: to pivot early toward fuel options that can actually scale with demand.

Here’s what that could look like:

Funding R&D for ammonia-fueled engines and onboard storage systems

Building or upgrading bunkering infrastructure at ports

Limiting how much biofuel counts toward clean fuel mandates to reflect real-world availability

Supporting the development of synthetic fuels and hydrogen-based systems

These aren’t quick fixes—but neither is a bidding war with aviation that the shipping sector is almost guaranteed to lose.

Why the Biofuel Crunch Keeps Getting Ignored

You’d think this looming crisis would have more attention. But a few factors keep the alarm bells muted.

First, consumption levels are still low, so the pain of scarcity isn’t felt yet. Second, policymakers are hesitant to slow down farm economies, especially in regions dependent on biofuel crops. And finally, there’s still no global agreement on how to track and verify biofuels’ real environmental impacts, especially when it comes to land use and lifecycle emissions.

The result? Industries are building decarbonization plans in silos, without considering how their strategies collide in the real world.

Final Thoughts: Aviation May Win the Biofuel Battle, But We All Need to Win the Climate War

If aviation takes most of the biofuel—and it likely will—then maritime has to be ready with Plan B. That means moving fast on scalable, clean alternatives and building a fuel strategy that doesn’t hinge on hope.

There’s no silver bullet here. But ignoring the limits of biofuels while planning for a carbon-free future is like charting a route with no map.",https://decarbonfuse.com/assets/favi/favicon-32x32-b1c94ae87840c662751403aefa5b6ea92417e97aab4cbce5a1b99c4e112cac36.png,N,,2025-04-10 19:56:59.865091

“Farmers and businesses need to know this tax credit is here to stay before they can invest in dozens of new energy projects across rural America.
This legislation provides a roadmap for how the 45Z tax credit can be improved to support farmers, and we are glad to support its introduction.” “American tax incentives should support American farmers — not put them at a disadvantage.
“At the same time, eliminating the outdated and flawed Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) penalty removes an arbitrary barrier that unfairly punishes U.S. producers while benefiting foreign competitors.
“We applaud Senator Marshall, Senator Klobuchar and the co-sponsors for their efforts to improve and extend the tax credit for biofuels.","Washington – U.S. Senators Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-Kansas) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) today reintroduced the bipartisan and bicameral Farmer First Fuel Incentives Act, which would protect American farmers by restricting the eligibility of the 45Z Tax Credit to renewable fuels made only from domestically sourced feedstocks. U.S. Representatives Tracey Mann (R-Kansas-01) and Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio-09) have introduced an identical bill in the House of Representatives.

This bill would extend the 45Z tax credit and give the ethanol industry the time and financial incentive to build up the infrastructure needed for the U.S. to be less reliant on foreign fuel, open new markets for farmers, and increase ethanol production across the Midwest. Additionally, this bill fixes the glaring flaw in 45Z that negatively impacts farmers wanting to sell feedstocks to the biodiesel and renewable diesel industry. If 45Z continues as-is, taxpayers are at risk of further subsidizing Chinese-used cooking oil and undermining the use of soy, canola, sorghum, and corn oil in renewable fuels.

“The Farmer First Fuel Incentives Act is commonsense legislation that stops sending American taxpayer dollars to China, expands robust domestic markets for agriculture producers, and increases certainty for the biofuels industry,” said Senator Marshall. “With President Trump in the White House and Republicans leading both the Senate and House, we are finally putting American farmers first and supporting biofuels made in the U.S.A. It’s time our energy and agricultural policies reflect that.”

“Domestically produced biofuel strengthens our energy independence, supports our farmers, and boosts rural economies,” said Senator Klobuchar. “The introduction of the Farmers First Fuel Incentives Act is an important step as we work to maximize the potential of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit and clean fuel investments across rural America. By extending the credit for another ten years, this legislation gives farmers and biofuel producers the certainty they need to provide consumers with affordable, lower-carbon fuel options.”

“American tax incentives should benefit American-grown products and American farmers, not foreign producers,” said Representative Mann. “Foreign feedstocks can play a significant role in producing domestically manufactured ethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel, but we cannot allow them to displace harvest grown right in our backyard. Our tax code should reward their grit and tenacity, not prop up feedstocks grown overseas.”

“Today, I joined my colleagues in this important bicameral and bipartisan effort because helping American farmers, producers, and growers goes beyond state and party lines, and is more important now than ever,” said Representative Kaptur. “We must ensure the Clean Fuel Production tax credit is structured in a way that benefits domestic producers, and not one that advantages foreign-produced feedstocks from China or Brazil. Our legislation extends this credit through 2034 and will bolster American energy independence by prioritizing American producers and the production of domestic biofuels.”

This legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Nebraska), Elissa Slotkin (D-Michigan), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin), and Pete Ricketts (R-Nebraska).

“Throughout my time in Congress, I’ve led the charge to build certainty and clarity into biofuel policies and put Iowa farmers at the forefront of delivering better, more affordable options at the gas pump,” said Senator Ernst. “The Farmer First Fuel Incentives Act does just that by giving producers the long-term certainty they need to go all-in on increasing production of domestic biofuels. It’s critical that we fully leverage homegrown, American biofuels and ensure not a cent of taxpayer dollars fund fuel produced with foreign crops.”

“America’s biofuel producers are a key piece in helping to secure U.S. energy independence,” said Senator Fischer. “That’s why Americans’ hard-earned tax dollars should support home-grown feedstocks—not incentivize foreign competitors. Our bipartisan legislation ensures that renewable fuel tax incentives support American producers—not overseas interests.”

“American tax credits should support American farmers. The Farmer First Fuel Incentives Act provides long-term certainty for Nebraskan producers through tax policy that makes sense,” said Senator Ricketts. “By bolstering the development of a domestic fuel supply chain, this bipartisan bill puts American farmers first.”

The legislation is supported by Growth Energy, American Soybean Association, National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA), National Corn Growers Association, National Sorghum Producers, U.S. Canola Association, and Renewable Fuels Association.

“Farmers and businesses need to know this tax credit is here to stay before they can invest in dozens of new energy projects across rural America. With this bill they’ll have the certainty they need to accelerate innovation, create thousands of new jobs, and secure new markets for farmers and biofuel producers,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “We applaud Sen. Marshall and Sen. Klobuchar for their leadership and thank all our rural champions for working to put American renewable fuel producers and farmers in the best possible position to succeed in next generation fuel markets.”

“ASA thanks Senators Marshall and Klobuchar for their leadership to ensure the 45Z tax credit supports domestic biofuel producers and domestic biofuel feedstock suppliers like soybean farmers,” said American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland. “The updated Farmers First Fuel Incentives Act includes one of our top priorities: removing arbitrary indirect land use change calculations, which put soy and all of U.S. agriculture at a disadvantage to imported waste feedstocks of dubious origin. This legislation provides a roadmap for how the 45Z tax credit can be improved to support farmers, and we are glad to support its introduction.”

“American tax incentives should support American farmers — not put them at a disadvantage. Ensuring that only domestic feedstocks such as U.S.-grown soybeans qualify for U.S. tax credits is a straightforward way to strengthen our domestic supply chain and rural economy,” said National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA) President and CEO Devin Mogler. “At the same time, eliminating the outdated and flawed Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) penalty removes an arbitrary barrier that unfairly punishes U.S. producers while benefiting foreign competitors. We appreciate Senators Marshall and Klobuchar for their leadership to ensure the Clean Fuel Production Credit works as intended — to support American agriculture and American energy.”

“We are deeply appreciative of these leaders for introducing legislation that establishes requirements for a tax credit that will level the playing field for America’s corn growers,” said National Corn Growers Association President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “This bill brings American farmers a step closer to unlocking an exciting new market with global reach.”

“We appreciate the focus on “farmers first” legislation and the support of 45Z and domestic feedstocks like sorghum,” said Amy France, Chair of the National Sorghum Producers. “Domestic biofuel production remains critical to our farm and our country’s success.”

“The U.S. Canola Association strongly supports the removal of arbitrary and uncertain indirect land use change (ILUC) assumptions from the calculation of federal clean fuel production tax credits,” said Tim Mickelson, President of the U.S. Canola Association. “We applaud Senator Marshall, Senator Klobuchar and the co-sponsors for their efforts to improve and extend the tax credit for biofuels. The flawed assumptions used to calculate indirect emissions have resulted in canola being excluded despite being a proven feedstock that the U.S. EPA’s analysis conservatively shows reduces emissions up to 78%. We urge Congress to enact these important changes to provide certainty, stability, and market opportunity for canola growers and our biofuels industry partners.”

This significant development increases Neste’s global SAF production capability to an impressive 1.5 million tons (approximately 1.875 billion liters) annually.

The modifications undertaken at the Rotterdam refinery now enable Neste to produce up to 500,000 tons of SAF per year. This milestone marks a crucial step in addressing the aviation industry's climate impact and supports the implementation of regulations like the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which mandates increasing levels of SAF blending in Europe.

This latest development is part of Neste’s broader strategy to invest significantly in renewable fuel production capacity. The company is currently undertaking a major strategic growth investment project in Rotterdam, which will more than double the refinery’s annual production capacity of renewable products to 2.7 million tons. Upon its scheduled completion in 2027, the Rotterdam facility will become the world’s largest producer of renewable diesel and SAF.

Heikki Malinen, President and CEO of Neste, emphasized the urgency of climate action within the aviation sector. “It is clear that we need to continue making progress in mitigating climate change and addressing aviation’s climate impact. Neste is fully committed to supporting its customers in the aviation industry to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and this milestone underlines that commitment,” he stated in a press release issued at 4 p.m. (EET).

Malinen further highlighted the significance of this expansion in the context of evolving policy. “Our SAF production capability, now also in Rotterdam, enables us to significantly contribute to the implementation of the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation and similar SAF mandates. Policies like these are crucial to ramping-up SAF production and usage, and we need to keep our ambitions and targets high. At the same time it requires support and close cooperation across the whole aviation ecosystem to accelerate the energy transition and related emission reductions.”

The ongoing expansion in Rotterdam will contribute significantly to Neste’s overall global renewable fuels production capacity, increasing it to 6.8 million tons annually. Of this total, Neste’s annual SAF production capability is projected to reach 2.2 million tons.

Beyond Rotterdam, Neste also possesses SAF production capabilities at its refineries in Singapore and Porvoo, Finland. This geographically diverse production network underscores Neste’s commitment to supplying SAF to meet the growing global demand and support the aviation industry’s transition towards a more sustainable future.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-04-10 15:56:34.065893

AI is exponentially more resource and capital intensive than previous technology paradigms – which means Big Tech companies need to find every efficiency angle possible.
Now, Big Tech will look to drive favorable deals with energy providers – if they don’t outright buy power plants themselves.
Thus far, Big Tech companies have primarily entered into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with energy providers.
This matters since Big Tech companies have yet to completely turn-face on their lofty environmental pledges.","To beat out both alternative energy sources, and alternative ownership models like vertical integration of energy generation into Big Tech supply chains, natural gas providers must prove their expertise at both economic and environmental sustainability.

According to Goldman Sachs, AI is poised to drive a 165% increase in data center energy demand by 2030. Big Tech needs so much power to fuel their AI investments, in fact, they are moving closer and closer toward integrating their own power supplies into their operational models. For example, Meta will become Entergy’s single largest customer once plans to build 3 power plants dedicated exclusively to supplying energy for Meta’s AI data center are completed. Chevron and GE recently announced a partnership to build the first multi gigawatt-scale co-located power plant and data center. Investors are taking note and incorporating a new type of asset into their technology investment strategy – Blackstone just acquired a power plant in Virginia’s Data Center Alley.

Given their demand for large, reliable energy supply, it is not surprising Big Tech, or as the industry has redubbed them “Hyperscale tech giants,” are turning to colocation and off-grid strategies to secure power – and control cost. According to Power Engineering hooking up to the grid can entail a 5-7 year wait time – which is out of the question for tech behemoths spending billions of dollars to ramp up AI datacenters this year.

The result? A new type of relationship between energy and technology companies in which energy becomes a competitive edge in Big Tech’s supply chain.

In this new world order, there will be winners. But what will dictate who gets the spoils (e.g. lucrative off-grid contracts to supply power to data centers)? Nimble, fast solutions to ramp up energy supply is certainly part of the answer – but it’s not the whole equation. In addition to speed, energy providers who can meet the dual challenges of efficiency and sustainability stand to gain in this new paradigm.

To win data center contracts, it will be increasingly important for energy companies to drive – and show – measurable operational efficiency gains. Even setting aside for a moment the sensitive cost dynamics of the AI market, it’s safe to assume that the closer “supply” gets to integrating into Big Tech’s supply chain, the greater the pressure for operational efficiency will be.

AI is exponentially more resource and capital intensive than previous technology paradigms – which means Big Tech companies need to find every efficiency angle possible. A recent illustration of the sensitive dynamics of the AI market: when China’s DeepSeek announced that its models allegedly use 10-40x less electricity than US-developed AI models, the stock market reacted with chip and energy stocks dipping. Microsoft and Google dipped too – why? Because less energy means fewer dollars spent on energy, giving DeepSeek a competitive advantage in the AI race. Energy costs account for 46% of total expenditures for enterprise datacenters, and 60% for service provider datacenters, according to a recent IDC report. The operational cost of data centers account for 15-20% of total AI investment by Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon according to expenditure numbers reported in Quartz. Thus, reducing energy costs is a huge lever in the AI race – one technology companies will do everything they can to pull.

Technology companies have already invested significantly in improving operational efficiency within datacenters. To reduce the resource-intensity of cooling processes, one source reports Microsoft is exploring everything from liquid cooling technology to an out-of-the-box concept of building data centers under water. Existing technology, magnetic bearing chillers, have already been proven to yield significant efficiency gains — reducing cooling costs by up to 40%, according to one study.

Now, Big Tech will look to drive favorable deals with energy providers – if they don’t outright buy power plants themselves. Thus far, Big Tech companies have primarily entered into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with energy providers. But, with Amazon’s acquisition of a nuclear-powered datacenter and associated energy infrastructure from Talen Energy last March and their direct investment in X-Energy to support the development of small nuclear reactors (SMRs), it’s easy to see how the mother of all vertical integrators could move into the energy business one day. In fact, Tesla is already in the energy generation business through their virtual power plant program, which aggregates and sells clean energy produced by at-home chargers back to the grid. All this suggests that IPPs need to act now to lock down contracts with AI data centers – or risk less favorable dynamics when Big Tech companies fully realize their appetite for DIYing power generation.

Historically, nuclear power has been talked about as a big winner in the AI data center game. However, natural gas power plants can generally be built in half the time as nuclear plants – or less. Technology like SMRs may be promising in the future – but for now, SMRs are not widely available and scalable. The real advantage nuclear has over natural gas is that it is both clean and reliable energy. This matters since Big Tech companies have yet to completely turn-face on their lofty environmental pledges. Knowing this, traditional energy companies like Exxon and Chevron are building carbon capture into their courtship of data center contracts.

However, carbon capture can significantly increase the operational costs of gas-powered plants. For natural gas providers to win long-term they will have to find solutions that prioritize operational efficiency while also supporting decarbonization efforts – if for no other reason than to hedge future shifts in political and regulatory winds. Luckily, existing technology can help natural gas companies check off both operational efficiency and sustainability boxes in their proposals to data center operators. For example, carbon capture is great – what if it was done at no additional cost and the captured CO2 was used to power turbines? It’s possible! Already have a power plant? What if infrastructure could be retrofit with turboexpander generators operating on magnetic bearing technology that could capture waste energy created in natural gas expansion processes and convert it to clean electricity that could be sold back into the grid or used to reduce operational costs (and emissions)? Also possible!

Which is to say, natural gas is a natural fit for data centers due to its reliability, scalability, speed-to-market, and cost-efficiency. If natural gas companies can figure out the last piece of the puzzle – decarbonization – without compromising any of these core value drivers, they stand to win big in the race to power AI.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/freddie-sarhan.png,N,,2025-04-10 15:56:39.267953

The sector’s adoption of CORSIA standards is creating a baseline of demand for low-carbon aviation fuel.","XCF Global, a leading player in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market, is preparing for a high-profile IPO in the coming days, seeking to establish a foothold in a market poised for growth both in the U.S. and globally, according to its CEO Mihir Dange.

“We are really just at the inception point of what this market is going to look like over the next 10 years,” Dange said in an exclusive interview. The company’s strategy hinges on securing early-mover advantages in a market expected to grow exponentially as airlines race to meet carbon reduction mandates.

Crucial to XCF’s public debut is its newly inked 15-year agreement with energy company Phillips 66 for both feedstock supply and offtake—a move Dange describes as “a base case model which is mitigated and has upside.” The agreement is designed to ensure operational stability while giving XCF the flexibility to pursue better pricing opportunities. It also allows for flexibility if circumstances change. “We pay for the right to move away from the Phillips 66 relationship if we want to, ” he added.

IRA Uncertainty Casts a Shadow

Despite the momentum, concerns loom over the stability of federal incentives such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The federal producer credits, vital for SAF economics, are set to expire in 2027. “..if federal credits left, there would be some type of state credits helping to push forward,” Dange assured.

In California, once the poster child for green fuel adoption, recent legislative changes have shifted momentum to other states. “We’re seeing a lot of that production actually moving out of the state and going into other states,” Dange observed.

But the company is betting on a shifting landscape across the country, where state-level incentives fill the federal gap. “Nevada is working on AB 481, which is potentially putting two and a half dollars of credits per gallon,” said Dange, emphasizing the importance of local legislation for future viability.

Emerging hubs like Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Washington, and Nevada are positioning themselves with new tax credits and rural development programs. “There are so many different business models that there is not one right answer,” he said, highlighting the industry’s experimental phase.

Still, the potential withdrawal of federal support raises broader questions about whether the reduced support in the U.S. can sustain the industry. “It would be foolish to think that a domestic-only strategy would be the only strategy going forward,” XCF Global’s CEO warns.

International Demand for SAF: Europe Leads, Asia Follows

Globally, the SAF sector is gaining steam. Europe, with its stringent mandates—2% SAF in 2025 scaling up to 70% by 2050—is leading the charge. “You cannot use book and claim to put it into the wing. You have to actually have the molecule into the wing of the plane,” Dange said, underlining Europe’s push for real emissions reductions.

Other regions are quickly catching up. “Japan is looking at a mandate. Australia wants to put a mandate. China has targets,” Dange noted, painting a picture of burgeoning international demand.

CORSIA Demand and XCF’s Expanding Project Pipeline

This pipeline of countries and markets provides certainty for future plans and could tie in nicely with the aviation industry’s main mechanism for SAF adoption – the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

The sector’s adoption of CORSIA standards is creating a baseline of demand for low-carbon aviation fuel. “CORSIA and international mandates…will not change the supply-demand need that more infrastructure has to come up, period” Dange stressed.

Looking ahead, XCF Global plans to leverage its first project’s success to launch additional production facilities. New projects will be shaped by local incentives, feedstock availability, and export opportunities, even involving complex logistics like “moving product from Reno to Europe” if economics allow.

At first glance this is a difficult moment for all carbon mitigating initiatives in the U.S. with various incentives being removed from the board and increasing uncertainty and risk. “That difficulty is also the opportunity that is born in the space,” Mihir Dange concluded.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mihir-Dange-Headshot-Cropped-V.Final-Greyed-e1744312517914.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 15:56:44.974394

It aims to support Microsoft’s goal to reduce Scope 3 lifecycle emissions from business travel and air freight.

Explaining further, Microsoft will co-fund an additional 39,000 tonnes of SAF that will cut 113,000 tonnes of lifecycle emissions.

The renewed agreement is an extension of their 2023 collaboration, when both companies pledged to support low-carbon aviation. For Microsoft, it’s a huge step toward achieving its 2030 carbon-negative goal.

Microsoft Targets Scope 3 Emissions with Major SAF Deal

Microsoft’s Scope 3 emissions rose by 30.9% in 2023 compared to its 2020 baseline. This increase was mainly due to the growth of its data center operations and the hardware needed to support them. Business travel and air freight also remain major contributors.

Total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 15.4 MtCO₂e in 2023, a 29.1% rise compared to the 2020 baseline.

Currently, over 96% of Microsoft’s total emissions come from Scope 3.

The tech giant is already boosting clean energy use across its supply chain and investing in low-carbon technologies for hard-to-decarbonize industries, such as steel, concrete, and other building materials used in its data centers.

The company’s $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund has already invested in LanzaJet, showing the company’s strong commitment to supporting next-generation fuel solutions and accelerating climate technology.

Thus, this deal is a significant part of Microsoft’s net-zero emissions pathway. It expects SAF use to make a notable impact on its air travel and freight shipments’ emissions.

SAF: A Key Step Toward Greener Flights, But Challenges Remain

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel. According to the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, SAF includes synthetic fuels, biofuels made from plant or waste materials, and recycled carbon fuels and not fossil fuels.

While it doesn’t cut emissions from aircraft engines directly, it lowers overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when considering the full life cycle, i.e., from production to use.

SAF reduces carbon emissions (on a greenhouse gas lifecycle basis) typically by 80% or more compared with the fossil jet fuels it replaces.

However, there are still big hurdles. Both IAG and Microsoft have acknowledged that scaling SAF production remains a challenge, largely due to high costs. SAF is still 3 to 4 times more expensive than traditional jet fuel. Notably, a small percentage of airline fuel today is SAF. Its production and availability need to grow much faster to make a real impact.

Consequently, the European Union introduced the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation. It’s also a part of the Fit for 55 plan that aims to cut emissions by 55% by 2030.

The regulation pushes fuel suppliers at EU airports to gradually mix more SAF into their fuel blends. Eventually, it can make the shift toward more sustainable flying easier.

The SAF will be sourced from two locations:

Phillips 66’s refinery in Humberside, UK, using used cooking oil and food waste.

LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Georgia, USA, using bioethanol.

Both SAF sources are ISCC-certified (International Sustainability & Carbon Certification). Additionally, the SAF used in this deal will not add new fossil carbon to the atmosphere as it recycles existing carbon.

How the Deal Benefits IAG and What are its Future Plans

However, this SAF deal benefits both Microsoft and IAG. While Microsoft can control its emissions from travel and freight, IAG can boost its SAF investments and lower its direct flight emissions.

IAG airlines follow carbon reduction rules under the EU, UK, and Swiss Emissions Trading Schemes. They also support CORSIA’s global plan to cap net aviation emissions.

Emission Reduction Goals

IAG aims to have net-zero emissions by 2050.

By 2025, it plans to cut carbon emissions per passenger kilometer by 10%—from 87.3g in 2020 to 80g.

To reach this, they’re adding 142 new aircraft that burn up to 25% less fuel. This also brings fuel use down to just 3.17 liters per 100 passenger kilometers.

By 2030, it intends to bring net emissions down to 22 million tonnes. That would be a 20% drop and will save 160 million tonnes of CO₂ over the decade.

Boosting SAF Use

Notably, the sustainable fuel from this agreement will power flights across IAG’s brands, including British Airways. In 2021, it set a target of using one million tonnes of SAF annually by 2030. Currently, the airline uses SAF for 1.9% of its total annual fuel. The right policy support could cut as much carbon as taking one million cars off the road annually.

By 2030, IAG aims to increase SAF use 100 times compared to 2022 levels. Its target is to reach 10% SAF by 2030 and 70% by 2050.

As of last December, the company had committed over $3.5 billion to SAF offtake deals. This is based on expected energy prices and contract terms.

This deal shows how companies can drive greener skies. By supporting cleaner fuels like SAF and influencing wider supply chains, Microsoft and IAG are taking the right steps to fight climate change.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shutterstock_2402135107.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 15:56:49.843988

Innovating for manufacturing sustainability

In FY 2023/24, Lenovo finalized and put into use an ESG management system called Lenovo ESG Navigator that helps monitor key ESG metrics in manufacturing. The innovative system offers near real-time insights on greenhouse gas emissions and energy use, replacing traditional manual management of ESG metrics with a flexible, transparent, and highly automated approach that captures data across the value chain from a single point of control, enabling more data-informed decisions in areas impacting sustainability performance.

Innovating to help customers meet sustainability goals

Lenovo is focused on providing products and services that help contribute to customers' sustainability goals and a smarter future for all. Through focused initiatives at the product, packaging, and service level, Lenovo is innovating to improve the sustainability features of products and empower customers with options to consider sustainability through services.

Product and packaging innovations that focus on carbon impact

The latest generation of Lenovo Neptune™ liquid cooling technology is delivered in a broader range of ThinkSystem servers than prior generations, making its sustainability benefits available to more of Lenovo's customers. Lenovo Neptune™ liquid cooling technology helps to optimize product performance by capturing up to 98 percent of the system heat and reducing power consumption by up to 40 percent.

In addition to product innovations in its servers, Lenovo takes a holistic look at customer experience and sustainability goals by improving packaging design across product offerings. The Infrastructure Solutions Group uses a rack integration method of shipping servers with pre-installed in racks, saving 105 pounds of cardboard per rack. Lenovo designs select PC packaging for it to be made from more sustainable materials like bamboo and sugar cane.

Empowering customers with more sustainable choices

Lenovo provides IT life cycle solutions such as Asset Recovery Services, CO2 offsetting capabilities, Reduced Carbon Transport options, and certified refurbished equipment. All of Lenovo's products are offered as-a-service, a delivery model which can help optimize IT asset sustainability.

TruScale Everything-as-a-Service: Circular Economy is all about designing out waste from the value chain. TruScale ‘as a Service' offerings optimize the process by leaving each stage of a product's cycle in the hands of qualified professionals so a customer can focus on their productivity priorities. TruScale inserts predictability into lifecycle management, enabling companies to plan and help maximize the reuse or recovery of their technology.

Asset Recovery Service: This service helps mitigate the environmental and data security risks associated with end-of-life asset disposal while aiming to maximize the value potential of those assets, with the main goal to reutilize, recover, and in the end, recycle resources.

Reduced Carbon Transport: This new solution empowers Lenovo's customers with transportation alternatives for IT purchases that generate lower carbon emissions, such as those that allow the purchase of Sustainable Aviation Fuel credits.

Innovative solutions for a circular economy

Lenovo's vision to deliver Smarter Technology for All extends to its practices that include Smarter Circular Design, Smarter Circular Use, and Smarter Circular Return activities. In a circular economy, products are made, used, then returned, instead of being discarded and consigned to waste. In this model, value is extracted from a resource while in use. Then, at the end of its service life, the resource is recovered, refurbished, and redeployed. This drives greater resource productivity, aims to make businesses more competitive, and helps create new opportunities for growth. The demand for a more circular economy has given rise to the ‘as a service' or usage models seen across many industries in which the users pay for only what they need when they need it, and return the assets or resources when they are finished.

Lenovo provides innovative solutions for its customers' business needs that help reduce the volume of end-of-life electronic products that may otherwise, be discarded or consigned to waste. These solutions include:

Services that help keep products operating longer;

Services that help make infrastructure management easier;

Solutions to manage its customers' products at the end of life to help maximize value and reuse opportunities.

Lenovo's introduction of TruScale Device as a Service (TruScale DaaS) to the PC industry has helped enable organizations to maximize value throughout a product's lifecycle and minimize raw material use and waste generation. TruScale DaaS is a usage model in which the consumer pays to use the device of their choice as they need it and has the option of pausing or returning the device when it is not in use. Along with the device, Lenovo offers a variety of services that aim to protect and support the asset during its lifecycle. When the device reaches the end of its service life, Lenovo will collect the device, wipe it clean of the customer's data, and strive to recycle and re-purpose the device. This means the device can either be refurbished and reintroduced into a new working environment, or the device's parts can be used to repair other devices under warranty.

Customers only pay for what they use, avoiding the heavy capital outlays of the ownership model, as well as escaping the burden and cost of disposal. These services are addressing the industry's transformation to as-a-service and providing lifecycle value to Lenovo's customers.

To help scale circular economy solutions in the IT industry, Lenovo has established a target to enable the recycling and reuse of 800 million pounds of end-of-life products by FY 2025/263. For more information see Section 9.0.

Conducted by the International PtX Hub, and organized by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ) in partnership with Evonik and Geo bio gas&carbon, this event highlighted the growing importance of SAF in driving the aviation industry’s defossilisation efforts. The training course was designed to support and strengthen the ecosystem of the SAF sector in Brazil, featuring a comprehensive programme led by Torsten Schwab, Director Technology of the International PtX Hub. Schwab, a prominent expert in sustainable fuels, guided the audience through key aspects of SAF technology, regulatory challenges, and funding opportunities, emphasising how renewable energies can revolutionise the production of sustainable aviation fuels.

Key Highlights of the SAF Training Course

The course covered a wide range of essential topics to provide a well-rounded understanding of the SAF sector:

Global Overview of SAF: Participants gained insights into the global need for sustainable aviation solutions and the key challenges the industry is facing.

Technological Routes for SAF Production: A deep dive session delved into various technologies used for SAF production, including HEFASAF, ATJ-SAF, Methanol to SAF, and FTS-SAF (Power-to-Liquid, Biogas-to-Liquid, and Biomass-to-Liquid).

Certification and Regulation: Participants were introduced to the ASTM criteria and procedures for SAF certification and the international regulations surrounding its use.

Financing Models and Economic Viability: Representatives from BNDES and GIZ presented financial incentives and support models for SAF projects in Brazil, offering a roadmap for economic sustainability.

Case Studies and Practical Examples: The event also featured real-world case studies, providing a valuable glimpse into the ongoing initiatives and opportunities in Brazil.

Interactive Sessions and Networking: Participants engaged in dynamic discussions and networking opportunities, fostering the exchange of ideas and the formation of strategic partnerships.

A Collective Effort for Defossilising Aviation

SAF represents one of the most viable paths towards the ‘de-fossilisation’ of aviation and requires a joint effort by companies, governments, and research institutions to scale its production.

Hendrik Schoenfelder, CEO Evonik Brazil

The assessment of Schoenfelder is more than right: Since most SAFs are still carbon-based – due to the CO2 used for their production – they cannot contribute to decarbonisation, but rather to defossilisation of the industry, that is, the avoidance of fossil feedstock for the new fuels (read more about Defossilising aviation with e-SAF). Schoenfelder noted further, that this event offered a valuable exchange of knowledge and underscored the aviation sector’s growing interest in adopting sustainable solutions. Gustavo Castro, Evonik’s Catalysts Business Manager, added,

Evonik is committed to offering innovative solutions that support the transition to more sustainable energy. We see the SAF market as a great opportunity to drive forward the energy transition by providing catalysts, adsorbents, and membranes that enable the use of renewable raw materials.

Gustavo Castro, Catalysts Business Manager at Evonik

Building Partnerships for the Future

Beyond technical discussions, the event served as a platform for exploring investment opportunities and fostering collaboration to advance SAF production in Brazil. GIZ promotes both public and private sector funded projects in this field. ‘We are proud to support the development of Brazil’s SAF sector,’ stated Dr. Bernd dos Santos Mayer, Coordinator of the Green Hydrogen Innovation Component at GIZ Brazil. He elaborated on the importance of the first SAF project in Brazil, which involves a partnership with Geo bio gas&carbon to create the country’s first commercial-scale plant for Syncrude production from biogas. This sustainable process, utilising biomass waste as a source of biogenic carbon, is a promising solution for SAF production and has the potential to fuel both domestic and international markets. The Fuel for the Future Law further underscores Brazil’s commitment to sustainability by promoting innovation and advancing the energy transition.

This partnership can boost an entire sector, contribute to the sustainability and decarbonisation of aviation, and generate economic growth, jobs, and a just energy transition. We hope this training inspires more companies to pursue SAF production projects across the country.

Dr. Bernd dos Santos Mayer, GIZ

Looking Ahead: The Future of SAF in Brazil

The SAF training course was a significant step toward building a sustainable aviation fuel sector in Brazil. It not only provided valuable insights but also facilitated the creation of vital partnerships that will help shape the future of aviation in the country. Trainer Torsten Schwab:

About ten years ago we started to reflect on SAF for niche scenarios in the remote areas of Brazil. Today we see Brazil at the forefront to contribute to clean aviation globally, being it with SAF or sustainable commodities such as e-methanol, which are becoming urgently needed for various value chains.

Torsten Schwab, Director Technology of the International PtX Hub

As more initiatives take shape and innovative solutions are developed, Brazil is poised to play a leading role in the global transition toward sustainable aviation. As the industry works together to make SAF production more viable on a large scale, the event served as a reminder that collaboration, innovation, and strategic investments are key to achieving a sustainable and decarbonised aviation future.

In March, AEF responded to a Department for Transport consultation on the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) revenue certainty mechanism (RCM). The RCM is being introduced to reduce the risk of SAF projects to encourage investment and development of a UK SAF industry. The government has confirmed their intention that this mechanism will be funded by industry, with this consultation looking at the exact format of this industry funding.

The RCM will take the form of a guaranteed strike price arrangement whereby a set price will be determined that SAF producers will receive when they sell their SAF product (a strike price). Producers then sell SAF at the market price and if this market price is below the strike price then producers are reimbursed with the difference. Similarly, if the market price is above the strike price then producers pay the difference back into the system.

This consultation proposes to place a levy on fuel suppliers that will cover any costs of the RCM (e.g. reimbursement payments that are due to fuel producers and costs of operating the scheme).",https://www.aef.org.uk/aef.ico,N,,2025-04-10 19:57:10.886178

Full transcript - 15th Annual LD Micro Invitational 2025:

Unidentified speaker: Made polyethylene, polypropylene, and stuff like that. Purity tracking is a business that tracks carbon through the whole value chain. It’s a SaaS business using the TLT technology. So we could track where did the carbon come from, how did it get here, what energy was used during production, all the way, for instance, to see if it ever improved. So the question is, well, you know, to buy you buy a jet fuel, how do you know it’s different?

That matters. That makes us a different game than that we’re a developer. We have a huge amount of technology, huge number of patents. I don’t have a roster So we are in an unusual position for a developer, and we have a strong balance sheet with several hundred million dollars on the balance sheet and cash. And so we’re in unusually solid position They call it instead of sustainable aviation fuel, they’re calling it synthetic aviation fuel, which is actually closer to the original name anyway, the ACM standards.

And so it’s one of these things that I think is being overlooked is that people are just, god. You know? It’s all things carbon are bad. No. Actually, it isn’t about that.

About it creates jobs. It’s potentially cost effective, competitive, with petrogenic, except for it’s made from your resource. Oh, and it makes carbon too and creates a lot of jobs. So it’s a little bit different game to play in different paradigm. One of the things that’s really important that we always drive home is that this is a scatter plot, jet fuel price versus oil price.

EVOS are just a scatter. And an integrated ATJ plan that we’re talking about is the green one there on the lower side, lower left. It’s cost competitive. I’m not joking. You can make it from renewable resources and still be cost competitive on a production cost base.

Photosynthesis makes a carbohydrate. We take the carbohydrate, make it into an alcohol by fermentation. Then we do chemistry, make it into ejecta. We’re capturing not just the carbon hydrogen, but all the electrons too. Everybody forgets that when they do the analysis.

Instead of having to mandate electronics, now we’re getting them from photosynthesis directly and keeping them and preserving them throughout. That’s why we have such an advantage. This is a economic curves or or bar charts against competitive technologies. Boils on the left. Our ATJ 60 economics are the one next to it there in the second from the left.

The gray is the cash cost production, the capital requirements to get good returns are the light green. But you can see why I’m seeing the cash cost reduction, we can be in the hunt with Metro. I find that astounding on fundamental level, fundamental economic level, we can be cash cost. But how do we deal with capital is the question. And you can see that we think you can lower it going forward at as we learn how to do realistic built EPC, you know, projects that has this the old fashioned way that, like, boost up cost.

And then import adds cost. They are disadvantaged. You have smaller plants that have fibers made for vegetable or waste cooking oil and things like that. We’re up about half of their cash cost of production. That’s a fundamentally important point.

Half of, though, is the one that’s mostly sold by companies like Nestea, and people like that, kind of renewables. So we like the fundamental position at the capital is the issue. One of the things that you see on this thing up from this about CI score is our CI score to be below zero. Why? We’re capturing renewable carbon, goes through the system, we get the new renewable electrons that come with it.

The ground. That’s biogenic c o two into the ground. And doing that, that creates value. So you get from actually lowest cost of carbon. Spoke free is what the customer of that would be.

People that’s voluntary. That’s in addition to the regulatory work. It’s what people get wrong about our company frequently is that they all it’s all about alright. 45 z. No.

It’s not. That’s one part The other part is a state park. The other part is rigs. Oh, and on top of that is the bottom tier.

We just announced yesterday a deal with a company in Europe who’s collecting and buying the carbon separate from the jet fuel. And I think that’s actually how this market’s gonna unfold. So jet a, it’s just jet a. It gets valued as jet a, and then we sell the carbon separately. That’s how it’s gonna work.

And then this is what I just described. These are all the kind of customers that we talked to. Just lots of them. So it’s a it’s a developing market. We can get Phil Knight, the science guy up.

He’s interested in this. He heard me talk and learn about this. Because it’s different paradigm. Who who heard of a cost effective approach Well, this plant is the lowest carbon intensity plant that we’re aware of in for ethanol production. That mean that turns into money and allows us to capture value from 45 z.

So here’s another thing that gets wrong that the industry gets wrong or the. 45 z is a law. It’s not getting undone. It is not getting undone. Sorry.

Too late. We’re already partway in the year. It’s included in this the bills that are being is a system of carbon traffic and trace. It really is tracking everything because how do you look. Here’s analogy to this cup.

It’s cup. Look at this cup. It’s better. Why? It’s plastic cup.

How do I know if it’s from renewables? How do know if it’s made from renewables? I said so. Proof where the carbon came from. That’s our belief.

That’s how you create value. Think of it as a brand. Anyway, that’s what Garrett is about, tracking and tracing. We track it through all the manufacturing. We have that operating already at the testing it out in plants.

We’re working with existing ethanol plants and soybean plants. We’re already working to make sure that we can measure the energy, give direct real time CI scores along as we manufacture stuff. So we think the future we think consumers ultimately are gonna wanna know, something for that money? Think did I get something for it? That’s actually what the game is about.

I met RNG. This is a we have 400,000 BTUs. We built this ourselves. We didn’t like EPC it is also we can take any these building blocks. We can make propylene with technology.

Propylene, we would deal with LG Chem in Korea to do these kind of technologies. And there’s also we can do these too. Again, how do you if you made these for renewals, how do you tell our different power back to? These all these pieces fit together with us. This will follow.

It won’t be the thing that drives. The fuels will drive it to develop the business So the question is how big is the market? How was the potential? Could it how big is the potential? That’s a really interesting question.

We were just talking about that. We’re looking at jet fuel. So jet fuel is projected It’s going to there’s a lot of room for growth here. And then when you consider that the ethanol industry is placed in the gasoline pool pool and as mileage increases, there’s less gasoline pool. NEDs will have an impact too, but it’s a there’s less it’s not growing.

And yet production can increase, and corn production can increase. So here in The States, we have a situation. We have an abundant amount of corn, and we can grow more on the same land. Ethanol is becoming overcapacity is overcapacity already, we can stop that up. So There’s a new.

Well, everything is wrong. Here in The States, we we could we don’t have to. We can use we’re the first to make economically? The the economics are advantaged here in The US. That’s for sure.

Way more than Capital cost for the plant. Two capital cost. So here’s the here’s what I don’t to push the cost down of the project. If I could build it myself and have the money to just build it, I’d be done. Other questions?

We already started working with airlines. We have. We have about we have several hundred million gallons of contracts already. They’re the problem with airlines are terrible to your old customers. They don’t have good balance sheets.

You can’t trust them. They don’t do long term off date agreements. It’s part of that game. The airlines are on a problem. That’s right.

So they and they can’t take pricing. That’s it. So this is the challenge. So remember remember, my plan was paid off. It’s competitive with jet fuel.

Straight up against the weather. Now if I get paid for that carbon value in some way in the marketplace, then I don’t need any government stuff, any credits. I don’t need anything. That’s what the future looks like. I would say so the question is, do we adopt is a new technology a new business model?

There are opportunities for incremental changes to technology? No. Today, we don’t need that. We just put it. It’s the business system that matters.

That’s what matters. It’s probably just our roadblock so far is all about financing. What’s the marketplace for car? Who’s gonna buy this stuff? Same questions.

They’ll insure they’ll buy all day long at the same price. Well, that’s. So who’s gonna pay their carbon value? That’s the question. That’s what we work on, and that’s what we have to establish.

And that takes real things. And in this space, there’s so much hype and BS. It’s a mind boggling, which is kind of magical stuff. It’s gonna save the world. No.

No. He’s a giant. Two two two billion pounds of corn. Okay? 2,000,000,000 pounds of corn was a no plant.

It makes 1,300,000,000 pounds of animal feed, 60,000,000,000 gallons of jet fuel. Think about that. That’s like a truckload of stuff every four minutes. You know? Think about the scale of these things.

According to the EPA, food waste makes up 24.1% of material sent to landfills, making it the largest category of municipal solid waste.
When it comes to managing food waste, landfills are not the way to go.
Not all food can be composted, so it doesn’t manage a large portion of food waste.
Food waste is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions, but seeing local indigenous communities implement ways to find benefits from processing food waste inspires hope for the Pacific Northwest at large.","If you take the highway south out of Walla Walla and keep going for about an hour, just before reaching Pendleton you’ll pass by the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR). Within the CTUIR, scientists are taking huge steps toward a sustainable future, particularly in regards to food waste management.

According to the EPA, food waste makes up 24.1% of material sent to landfills, making it the largest category of municipal solid waste. This causes major problems since the decomposition of organic matter in oxygen-free environments generates methane, a greenhouse gas that poses more danger to our climate than carbon dioxide. Modern landfills are usually built with impermeable liners and capped once they reach capacity, which cuts off landfill waste from oxygen exposure. This means that when food waste is left to decompose in landfills, it just contributes to methane emissions in the atmosphere. When it comes to managing food waste, landfills are not the way to go.

Sustainable alternatives are crucial. Composting is a popular option. It’s a process in which organic materials are set aside to decompose into a carbon and nitrogen-rich soil product, sometimes colloquially referred to as compost-tea. When done properly, this method reduces (but does not eliminate) methane emissions and produces a result that works great as fertilizer. Many major cities in the Pacific Northwest, including Seattle and Portland, have even implemented city-wide composting.

It’s a decent way to handle food waste, but it doesn’t come without downsides. Not all food can be composted, so it doesn’t manage a large portion of food waste. Unless a compost pile has generated a significant amount of heat, many energy-dense items such as meat, dairy and oil can’t be composted. Additionally, large-scale composting sites often deal with contamination, making the product less useful. Fortunately, it’s not the only solution.

CTUIR’s new project, “Nixyaawii, Don’t Throw It Away!“ presents an alternative that’s potentially even more efficient: anaerobic digestion.

“It works a lot like how our stomachs digest things,” said Colleen Sanders, a co-director of the project. “We use our teeth to break up living matter, and then we swallow it again in anaerobic conditions, where microbes will break it down and release the nutrients … both in a physical form [and] gaseous form.”

Like composting, anaerobic digestion involves microbes aiding in the decomposition of organic matter and results in a physical product that can be used as fertilizer. Unlike composting, anaerobic digestion does not reduce methane production. Methane gas is a natural byproduct of the process, but the methane is caught before it can be released into the atmosphere. With this project, the methane is then refined and used as energy.

“We call it renewable natural gas because it is a methane gas that comes from the decomposition of living materials. So it’s not coming from a fossil fuel. It’s coming from materials that already exist and are within a harmonious carbon cycle on the land,” Sanders said.

The project was initiated by DeArcie Abraham, owner and operator of BioWaste Technologies LLC. She is a gardener and enrolled tribal member who noticed the need for waste management techniques within the community.

“I was a composter originally,” said Abraham. “I started composting with worms … the microbiology they put out when they process waste was interesting to me. I ran into some anaerobic digestion information, but I didn’t ever dream of my tribe picking something like that.”

It wasn’t until she brought her ideas to Sanders, who works within CTUIR’s First Foods Policy Program, that the ball started moving on the project. In collaboration, Abraham and Sanders secured a grant from the USDA to kickstart the process.

“The anaerobic digestion came about because of the EPA food waste hierarchy,” said Sanders.

The EPA’s food recovery hierarchy is a useful guideline in terms of the ideal use of the food supply.

“With extra food, you should feed hungry people first, and then you should feed hungry animals, and then you should use it for industrial purposes, and then you should compost it, and at the very bottom, it should go into the landfill. I was curious about what those industrial uses would be,” Sanders said.

The process itself is quite simple, but the project has a number of pieces to it. Once food waste is collected, it is taken to the Áq’paš (pronounced “ak-paash,” which translates to “stomach”) where the anaerobic digestion takes place.

“There’s an inlet where you put your waste … and then there’s an outlet where the output of the wastewater or compost-tea will come out. On the top of [that] bag is where the gas will collect. The bag then will go through a scrubber [which] will scrub out some compounds that make the gas dirty. That will clean the methane so that [it] is a pure form. [A] hose will connect to either a stove or a generator that will convert the gas into electricity,” said Abraham.

The process is seasonally dependent since the microbes that facilitate digestion thrive in warmer temperatures. This meant that the Áq’paš could not begin operations during the winter months. But as of March 5, the system is up and running.

“We had to postpone starting the Áq’paš until the temperature outside has reached about 40 degrees at night,” said Sanders. “We were a little bit saddened that we weren’t able to start the Áq’paš earlier, but this is what it means to be seasonal. Sometimes, you have to wait for the appropriate time for something to happen.”

Inevitably, colder seasons will limit the productivity of the Áq’paš, but now that it’s started, Sanders and Abraham are hopeful that it can maintain enough momentum to operate continuously.

“It’s a little bit like a beehive,” said Sanders. “If you get it robust and get it going through the winter and provide a little bit of buffering for it, there’s a good chance it can make it through.”

The Áq’paš is located in a building set up near the Mission Longhouse, which is a key tribal community center.

“A lot of stuff happens in the longhouse,” said Allen Zamudio, an enrolled CTUIR tribal member and first-year Whitman student. “Feast, memorials, powwows, culture night … there’s usually food involved. Sometimes they’ll make fry bread for the powwow. Sometimes for memorial services or namings, you’ll have food afterward.”

This project location makes it easier for the community to engage with the project and for those working on the project to gauge how the community feels about it.

“While we’ve waited for temperatures to become hospitable for our Áq’paš, we’ve been gathering information and making sure that our community is comfortable with what we’re doing,” Sanders said. “A lot of times the longhouse cooks have also expressed a desire to be better with working with the stuff that gets thrown away as part of events.”

As the program gets off the ground, support from the broader region will be needed to help keep the system alive.

“It’s definitely a regional effort. We know that we as a tribe probably don’t generate enough to sustain a large-scale facility,” said Sanders.

The “Nixyaawii, Don’t Throw It Away!“ project is a promising strategy for food waste management, and it is still in its infancy. Right now, there are still many unknowns. It will be exciting to find out how much energy will be produced or how the Áq’paš will handle seasonal changes.

It is also just one piece of CTUIR’s moves towards sustainability. Zamudio has noticed other small changes being made as part of these efforts.

“The tribe started distributing reusable utensils for people to bring so that we’re using less plastic. I don’t know how often people actually use them, but it is a new thing that’s been introduced to the community,” Zamudio said.

In today’s world, the uphill battle towards a sustainable future looks steep.

“If properly implemented, the 45Z tax credit has the potential to advance U.S. energy security, prioritize domestic energy resources, strengthen rural economies, and create a transformative incentive for the adoption of new technologies in the renewable fuels and agriculture sectors,” RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. “The technology-neutral intent of 45Z represents the most economically efficient and environmentally responsible approach to boosting U.S. energy production. However, for the 45Z program to truly drive innovation and value creation in the marketplace, Treasury must move expeditiously to propose, finalize, and promulgate implementing regulations. Clean fuel producers, including RFA’s members, are in desperate need of clarity, certainty, and stability in the regulatory framework supporting the 45Z tax credit.”

Cooper added that RFA believes the final 45Z regulations must recognize the realities of today’s biorefining and agriculture sectors and the complexities of our nation’s transportation fuels marketplace. At the same time, final regulations must maintain an intuitive and manageable approach to registration, reporting, and recordkeeping that creates the kind of dependable value that empowers businesses to invest.

Among RFA’s comments:

Treasury needs to clarify its intentions and definitions around “qualifying sale,” an “unrelated person,” a “member of a consolidated group,” and the applicability of safe harbor provisions.

Treasury’s approach to rounding of emissions factors should be reconsidered.

Treasury should formally integrate climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices into the 45Z program.

Treasury should modify Prevailing Wage and Apprenticeship (PWA) requirements.

Treasury should expeditiously implement the Provisional Emissions Rate (PER) process and allow a more flexible approach.

The short duration of 45Z, and Treasury’s delay in promulgating rules, is discouraging innovation and investment and undermines the objectives of the program.

The proposed structure for 45Z creates an unintended disincentive for the production of alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

In response to specific questions from Treasury, RFA commented that the 45ZCF-GREET model offers a far more current and thorough understanding of lifecycle emissions than either CORSIA or the approved pathways under the RFS program. Also, Treasury should include emissions rate pathways for biofuel derived from corn kernel fiber and sorghum kernel fiber and provide the option to segregate those gallons for 45Z credit generation purposes.",https://ethanolrfa.org/image/1759/1000/treasury+bldg.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 12:57:18.947678

The global biodiesel market is valued at USD 49.05 billion, based on a comprehensive five-year historical analysis. The market growth is primarily driven by increased adoption of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, favorable government policies like blending mandates, and rising crude oil prices that push demand for sustainable alternatives.

The market is dominated by countries like the United States, Germany, and Brazil due to their strong regulatory frameworks, advanced infrastructure for biodiesel production, and abundant availability of feedstock. The United States benefits from its Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS), while Germany leads in Europe with its focus on decarbonization policies. Brazil's dominance is fueled by its agricultural sector, which provides an ample supply of soybeans and other feedstocks.

Global Bio-Diesel Market Competitive Landscape

The global biodiesel market is highly competitive, with key players leveraging their extensive supply chains, advanced technology, and strategic investments to maintain dominance. The market is characterized by a mix of multinational corporations and region-specific players, each focusing on innovation and sustainability.

Technological Advancements: Biodiesel production has improved significantly with technologies like Crown's ACRE, which optimizes transesterification to save catalysts and energy. Pyrolysis technology also enhances the process by allowing a variety of feedstocks to be converted into biodiesel, making production more sustainable and cost-effective. These advancements are crucial for increasing both the efficiency and sustainability of biodiesel production.

Increased Demand for Sustainable Energy: Biodiesel is gaining traction due to its role in reducing carbon emissions, especially in the transportation sector where it's used as an alternative to traditional diesel fuels. This is driven by growing environmental concerns and climate change awareness. In the transportation sector, companies like UPS and FedEx have integrated biodiesel into their fleets to reduce carbon emissions and meet sustainability goals.

Market Challenges

Feedstock Availability and Sustainability: Biofuels from agricultural crops compete with food production for land, posing potential food security issues. The cultivation of biofuel crops can lead to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and water depletion if not managed sustainably. For Instance, in Indonesia and Malaysia, large tracts of tropical forests have been cleared to plant palm oil, which is a key feedstock for biodiesel. This has led to significant biodiversity loss and increased carbon emissions.

Economic Viability: Producing biofuels involves high costs for growing, harvesting, and conversion, often exceeding those for fossil fuels without subsidies or technological advancements. Many biofuel projects depend on government subsidies to remain economically viable, leaving them vulnerable to policy changes. For Instance, the U.S. biodiesel industry has experienced fluctuations in production linked to the expiration and reinstatement of the biodiesel tax credit, demonstrating how dependent the industry is on government financial support.

Global Bio-Diesel Future market Outlook

Over the next five years, the global biodiesel market is expected to exhibit significant growth reaching a market size of USD 77.50 Billion by 2031 fueled by government mandates for renewable energy usage, increased investments in advanced biofuel technologies, and rising awareness about carbon footprint reduction. The transportation and power generation sectors are likely to witness the highest adoption of biodiesel as governments worldwide aim to achieve decarbonization targets.

Market Opportunities

Growth in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): The global biodiesel market is experiencing significant growth, driven in part by the expansion ofSustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)production. With new mandates from the EU and Japan, SAF is increasingly being integrated into existing refinery setups through co-processing technologies, which offer competitive costs and facilitate the transition to greener fuels.

Diversification of Feedstocks: The diversification of feedstocks is another key trend influencing the biodiesel market. Non-edible oils are gaining traction as viable feedstocks, particularly in Europe and the U.S., which supports long-term production capacities and sustainability goals. The increasing use of these alternative feedstocks helps mitigate competition with food resources and enhances the overall sustainability of biodiesel production.

Last year, SAF production volumes reached 1m tonnes, double the 0.5m tonnes produced in 2023.
But SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel production and 11% of global renewable fuel.
The shortfall comes as key SAF production facilities in the US pushed back their production ramp-up to the first half of 2025.
This year, SAF production is expected to reach 2.1m tonnes or 0.7% of total jet fuel production and 13% of global renewable fuel capacity.","Aviation’s drive to net-zero emissions by 2050 faces several challenges, not least in funding the ambitious target.

IATA forecasts an average of $128bn in annual capital expenditure will be needed for the airline industry to reach its net-zero goals.

Describing the $128bn forecast as a “best-case scenario”, IATA notes that it is “significantly less” than total investments in solar and wind energy markets between 2004 and 2022, which it puts at around $280bn.

Part of the capital will go towards building new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) refineries that are central to the sector’s net-zero road map.

“The costs and challenges associated with the energy transition are large, but the opportunities are even greater,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president of sustainability and chief economist, at a sustainability event last year.

“Countries have an opportunity to build new industries in agriculture and energy, and to benefit from the catalytic growth impact of sustainable air transport.”

IATA continues to argue that the airline industry cannot be expected to fund new facilities, particularly given its long history of thin profit margins.

The association expects extra costs of $1.4bn to the global airline industry from procuring SAF in 2025, but notes this could rise to $744bn by 2050 once SAF usage is more widespread and other fuels such as hydrogen come into play.

Meanwhile, IATA labelled the growth of SAF production as “disappointingly slow” in 2024. Last year, SAF production volumes reached 1m tonnes, double the 0.5m tonnes produced in 2023.

But SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel production and 11% of global renewable fuel. This is significantly below previous estimates that projected SAF production in 2024 at 1.5m tonnes.

The shortfall comes as key SAF production facilities in the US pushed back their production ramp-up to the first half of 2025.

This year, SAF production is expected to reach 2.1m tonnes or 0.7% of total jet fuel production and 13% of global renewable fuel capacity.

IATA director general Willie Walsh says: “SAF volumes are increasing, but disappointingly slowly. Governments are sending mixed signals to oil companies, which continue to receive subsidies for their exploration and production of fossil oil and gas.

“And investors in new generation fuel producers seem to be waiting for guarantees of easy money before going full throttle.

“With airlines, the core of the value chain, earning just a 3.6% net margin, profitability expectations for SAF investors need to be slow and steady, not fast and furious.

“But make no mistake that airlines are eager to buy SAF and there is money to be made by investors and companies who see the long-term future of decarbonisation.

“Governments can accelerate progress by winding down fossil fuel production subsidies and replacing them with strategic production incentives and clear policies supporting a future built on renewable energies, including SAF.”

Critical importance

SAF has a key role to play in helping the aviation industry achieve net zero emissions, so its importance cannot be understated.

In total, IATA estimates that 65% of the net-zero target will be met through the use of SAF, with 13% coming from hydrogen and electric propulsion, 3% from more efficient operations and 19% through offsets and eventually through carbon capture.

Away from SAF, IATA is also focusing on reducing plastic waste in air cargo operations, reducing perishable loss along the supply chain, and driving sustainability and efficiency in cargo handling.

To reduce plastic waste, IATA is helping the industry cut the amount and thickness of plastic sheets and stretch wrap with a plastic sheet sizing chart, plus it is developing procedures for the adequate reutilisation of plastic sheeting. The association is also promoting the use of reusable alternatives.

IATA has additionally developed procedures for adequate segregation and recycling of waste.

On perishables loss, figures from The Food and Agricultural Organisation estimate that $940bn is lost in food production each year. And 14% of this figure is lost in distribution, which results in significant greenhouse gas emissions.

To help reduce loss, in December 2023 IATA produced guidance on perishable loss in air cargo to help companies reduce waste during transport.",https://d1m8zjqyxnlv3j.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/9/0/7/10907_greenfuelaircraft_photo_scharfsinn_shutterstock_2270822133_493124.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 11:57:31.630445

The Pilatus PC-12 Pro, unveiled in March 2025, has a completely new cockpit; safety functions such as Autoland, Smart Glide and Electronic Stability; plus new interior finishes and colour schemes.

Cabin

The PC-12 Pro cabin was designed to offer a modern but timeless design, as well as comfort. All-new cabinetry provides additional storage space.

Entirely fresh colour schemes are also available. Interior and exterior designs feature sleek patterns and futuristic finishes intended to give the aircraft a dynamic, high-tech look.

Cockpit

The updated Advanced Cockpit Environment (ACE) is powered by the Garmin G3000 Prime Integrated Flight Deck. It is fully customised by Pilatus, with features such as the company’s proprietary Cursor Control Device, track-based synthetic vision, and exclusive visual customisation. Three large, high-resolution touchscreen flight displays, supported by two 7in secondary touchscreen displays, provide twice the processing power, four times the RAM capacity as the original G3000.

The completely redesigned cockpit also features ergonomic control yokes inspired by those in the PC-24, as well as an updated cockpit interior. Exterior visibility has been improved by removing the Direct Vision cockpit window frame.

Autoland

The PC-12 Pro integrates Garmin’s complete array of advanced safety features, Pilatus shared, including the emergency Autoland function. Improvements have also been made to the integrated Stall Warning & Protection System and the Electronic Stability and Protection function. The weather radar features a new and larger antenna to provide even greater situational awareness in the cockpit.

Power plant

The single-engine PC-12 Pro is equipped with the latest version of the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6. There are more than 60,000 PT6 family engines in service, which have accumulated more than 400 million flight hours. The PT6 engine has already been thoroughly tested in over eleven million flight hours in the PC-12, Pilatus noted.

The company said that in combination with the fully automatic electronic engine and propeller control system (EPECS), the digital thrust control, or Autothrottle System, reduces the pilot’s workload, optimises performance, increases fuel efficiency, ensures a quieter flying experience and protects against engine overlimit events. Pilatus added that the PC-12 Pro also generates fewer CO2 emissions and is ready for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Window Seat Aviation Week Air Transport Podcast. I'm ATW, an Aviation Week Network Air Transport Editor-in-Chief, Karen Walker. Welcome on board. Now this week I'm absolutely thrilled to be joined by somebody who I think of as a friend in this industry definitely. It's Grace Cheung, who is the general manager of sustainability at Cathay Pacific Airways. Grace, it's great to talk with you again.

Grace Cheung:

Hello, Karen. Hello, everyone.

Karen Walker:

Hi. Hello. Now Cathay Pacific, of course is based in Hong Kong, has a long legacy, one of the world's oldest airlines, and I'm just going to quickly put this in. I must, it's very important. Cathay Pacific has also just been named the Air Transport World 2025 Eco Airline of the Year. So congratulations to you, Grace, and of course the entire Cathay team. Being Eco Airline of course in this day and age is a very, very prestigious title. So well done. Now, sustainability, as I said, it's a very big topic in this industry, and so this is what we're going to be talking about. Grace, can you just kick us off please? Sustainability, we've had this conversation a few times, but it can't be one person, obviously. It can't really even be one airline, of course. We've sometimes talked in terms of looking at sustainability like safety, everybody's got to be involved. But as an airline, can we start off by hearing from you, what does Cathay see as the most important issues to address when it comes to sustainability? What are your priority focus areas?

Grace Cheung:

Thank you, Karen. Our next sustainability really we see as the core DNA of Cathay, because what we said is our brand's purpose is to move people forward in life. And when we talk about people, it's not just customers of today, but also our customers in future. And to ensure we are able to do that, sustainability really is a key component. So from our perspective in terms of environmental sustainability, we see two priority area. First and foremost, it's definitely around climate change, because of the jet field we use. On the other hand, material circularity economy is also very important. This is all the material our customers and our people came along when they fly with us during the customer journey, that they feel most relational and kind of really close to resonate with their own experience.

Karen Walker:

So yeah, I think that's an important part to these days. Everybody of course talks about decarbonization reducing emissions and carbon in the air. That's sort of obvious. It's also very, very difficult. But there's another very important element of this is, as you say, reducing waste and using lighter recycled materials. I've seen at Cathay, this is obviously a very important part of why you won the award, is that you take that holistic view across all parts of Cathay. The cargo side, the low cost carrier, HK Express, obviously the main Cathay Pacific Airline. But you take that very seriously I think in terms of it's got to be the whole deal, the whole package. Does that sound right?

Grace Cheung:

Yes, thank you, Karen, and you understand what we have been doing very well. So thanks for that. So in terms of material circularity, I think first and foremost we put our effort in reducing single-use plastic, because when we talk to our people, our customers, it seems to them that this is the first and foremost items in their mind that they really expect Cathay as a group to do something about, in terms of reducing our single-use plastic usage as well as finding ways to reduce the environmental impact as and when we must still use some of those items. Because to be honest, plastic is good in certain way. It's light, so for climate change perspective, it reduces the weight of aircraft and reduces carbon emissions, and it's versatile. And when we were very concerned about hygiene and the protection of goods, and customer journey is still is of good use.

So the question is can we find good quality replacement where we can, so reduce the use of plastic, as well as replacing those that are originally maybe single-use by replaceable item. So I think we follow along those lines in those direction, both replacing a lot of our single-use plastic. So previously back in 2018, when we first did our baseline research, on a per passenger basis, it was over seven pieces per passenger faces, single-use plastic at that time. After first round of reduction, we brought that down to about half, after the first three years reduction period. And our new latest target is to bring that further down to 1.5 pieces of single-use plastic per passenger by end this year, 2025. And at the same time we are also looking at increasing the ratio of remaining plastic item to use recycled plastic as a source material, as well as improving our own in-house recycling rate as well. So really creating a closed-loop economy model to encourage our upstream and downstream partner to join us in that journey.

Karen Walker:

And that was the other thing that struck me when we were looking at the detail for this award was you also seem to have a really good mindset of goals and targets, and measuring things. You don't just sort of say, ""Oh yeah, we're really good at this."" You've got numbers and statistics. Measuring this is very important, yes?

Grace Cheung:

Yes. I think I forgot which management guru, but someone has said this wise word of if you can't measure something, you can't manage it. So I think actually sustainability is a lot about data and management. Without a fact we can't move forward. So I think that's part of the groundwork we've been working on very hard to make sure we get the right data, so as to identify weak links and to move on from there.

Karen Walker:

Absolutely. Now can you talk a little bit about the collaboration and partnerships behind everything that you do when it comes to sustainability? That's within Cathay of course, and outside with your partners. What is happening there?

Grace Cheung:

Yes, I think collaboration is one key pillar we see and actually we like to quite greener together, because we believe that no one can really say they are green. I think every decision we make, whether it is for businesses or for individual, every decision will have some impact on the environment. The question is, can we make more conscious choices so that our decision is a greener one? And there's always room for improvement, so we can never be green enough. And this, really sustainability topic is so complex, no single organization or individual can do it alone. So only by working together we can all go greener together. So that really encapsulates our belief and approach in sustainability. So in Cathay we work on various sustainability topic, we truly believe in working with different stakeholders. So we talks a bit about single use plastic earlier, but then I may be able to talking about our main focus, the use of sustainable aviation fuel, which we believe to be the most important lever in decarbonizing aviation in the next few decades, leading all the way up to 2050.

Sustainable aviation field is very challenging, because it's still in very early stage of its industrialization process. It needs lots of investments. So we need to engage the supply chain, all the way from where those sustainable feedstocks coming from, and financial institutions, banks on how and what would make them willing to invest in this important supply chain. And of course our customers as well, whether they see the value of the use of sustainable aviation fuel, or we call it SAF, in terms of their consumer choices. So that when working with airlines and the whole ecosystem, more SAF can be used to decarbonize the whole aviation surfaces. But all this could not happen if a supportive policy is not in place, because all these billions of dollars of investments and investors and the market needs certainty in place and only a long-term stable policy with supporting measures on all these fronts could make it happen. So we have been working very closely with all these parties along supply chain, just take side customers to make sure everyone do their part, so that together we can decarbonize the aviation surfaces according to plan.

Karen Walker:

You raised a couple of very important points there. The government policies and government support, we see that as you know, it differs around the world and it seems to change also, doesn't it? Especially when it comes to SAF. Can you talk a little bit, maybe give us a few specifics of who you think of as key partners, particularly in that SAF, how to get more SAF? Because as we know, as you said, the problem is there isn't enough of it, there's nowhere near enough of it at the moment, and what there is very expensive. And airlines of course are still recovering financially from the effects of the COVID pandemic. So this is all very important and it's all tied together. So who are the key partners for you right now?

Grace Cheung:

So I think one thing as airline we see we could help unlock that supply is to find the demand, and that's why at Cathay we have launched the first major corporate SAF program in Asia, back in 2022. So how it works, our scheme is that we work with our corporate clients, because we know many of them just like us, share the commitment and share the belief that we as corporates need to do something about climate change. So these corporates are usually quite big customers. They would have quite significant carbon footprint from aviation services, whether it is the travel of their employees flying around the world doing businesses or shipping of their cargo through air freight.

So these corporates would have a lot, quite a lot of scope free indirect carbon emissions incurred. And by working with them we basically offer them the opportunity to make financial contribution for the use of SAF, not waiting until 2030, but started right then from 2022 onwards to allow us as the airline to work with SAF supplier to start buying and using, and scaling up the use of SAF. Basically putting our words in action, telling the suppliers that there is real demand there and it's not just an empty talk, but with real money on the table and hopefully by all these collaborations we can help bring more SAF supply online.

Karen Walker:

Right, okay. It's interesting, this is my perception, but when aviation really started to talk very seriously about the decarbonization, setting goals, et cetera, and started to talk about how are we're going to get more SAF, it seemed to me at the beginning of this that it was really Europe that was leading the charge. And then the United States surprised everybody and seemed to really be getting into all of this, and really became a leader. It now seems to be that it shifted, Asia is really coming on strong in this. Now of course Asia was also longer coming out of the COVID pandemic, so there was that. But is that your perception too? It just seems to me like there's a lot of activity all of a sudden going on in Asia on this and is that because people expect it, your customers expect it, what's going on?

Grace Cheung:

So I do agree with your observations. I think a lot is happening in Asia currently around SAF and I observed that coming from different angles as well. First we talked about the importance of supporting policy and as you mentioned, the European Union or UK have already long sets their SAF-related policy and is already started implementing. And on the US side they have also implemented some supportive measure in terms of the research and development, and development of supply chain, et cetera. So in Asia in recent, not even years, but in recent months, we still see a lot of consultation happening in the market that different policymakers, different states looking at different potential ways to increase and encourage domestic SAF development, whether it's from the supply chain front or from usage perspective. So we consider that to be really active and positive sign that the momentum is also moving on in this part of the world. Besides policymakers, we also see quite a lot of actions in the supply side also.

Actually lots of study. He told us that Asia is a very good location for developing future SAF, because loss of the feedstock actually comes from the region, whether it is user cooking oil, I don't know, that may be something to do with Chinese cuisine. We do use a lot of user cooking oil and that could be the very good feedstock, but also other agricultural waste with the land and agricultural activities in the region. There's also lots of good supply for the long term and even for the further down the line, the power to liquid synthetic fuel, renewable energy is also kind of both cheap and in abundance, especially in China. So I think this region is really well positioned to be the future kind of powerhouse in producing SAF and it's great to see a number of those initiatives, and even started by individual investors kind of coming up here and there in Asia.

So that's really good sign. Last but not least is the customer front you mentioned. I think what we see is that since the launch of our corporate SAF program, we do see a lot of customers, not only the launch partners, but since we launched the program that they then came to us proactively, because there are partners looking for partner airline to have their SAF footprint in Asia. So I think that's also another good sign that we are seeing that there is interest, not only about using SAF in other better developed market, but to support specific initiatives taking part in Asia.

Karen Walker:

And that's good, because as you say, there's a lot of potential across Asia, vast area, different, but lots and lots of opportunity there in terms of its resources and people, but it's also of course it's still going to be one of the fastest growing regions in terms of aviation. So these things again need to be glove in hand, working together. So good to see. Let's get to the thorny issue here, which is we've talked about the lack of the supply of SAF in terms of how much is really needed, but also of course the cost of all of this. So as we all know, IATA set the 2050 net-zero carbon goal a few years back, but recently IATA's Director General, Willie Walsh, acknowledged it may not be achievable. IATA's put the cost of this transition to be around $4.7 trillion, huge amounts of money. What are your thoughts on this?

Grace Cheung:

I think definitely there is the economic issues that need to be tackled, but I think the way I see is that the good news is airlines shouldn't be the only one be in the picture, because I think it's through the supply chain and actually through or people taking part as part of this ecosystem, whether it's the user of the aviation service, supply chain, actually we are all in it together to meeting that decarbonization challenge. Of course our discussion have been focusing on SAF, but even other technology or even other upstream R&D to bring down the cost significantly. I think that's also important and that's really beyond what airline can see through as wind control. I remember before electric vehicle becomes so popular nowadays or even when we talk about solar panel, the cost for renewable energy, the estimate not even 10 years ago, the five years ago, I think we have never imagined the price of those cleaner solution can come down so much.

So I think IATA definitely has done their homework and done their study to come up with the cost estimate. And as I understand it, that's the best estimate based on the current day technology. But I think as we can learn from all the examples in front of us to significantly bringing clean technology to be widely scaled up, the true key to unlock that potential is on the new technological development to really able to make an economic case for that transition with those economic breakthrough. I believe that the cause for future SAF production, as well as potentially other technology required to decarbonize aviation would be within reach.

Karen Walker:

So that sounds to me that you feel is still confident that the industry will get there. It sort of has to, but despite the challenges, shall we say. I know that you and Cathay executives now spend quite a lot of time also advocating for this and reaching out wider. You are talking to the other groups and organizations, and other airlines around the world, et cetera, and you're going to conferences, et cetera. Are you still getting that feeling of confidence when you are out and about outside of Hong Kong?

Grace Cheung:

I think to be honest, I think it is not so much about confidence, but I think it's about conviction, or I think it's really about industry players that everyone that I have talked to, I've met with, we really, all of us working very hard to try to get it done. And I think there are lots of things that may not be in our control. For instance, whether it is the policy that we have been talking about or the development of this much needed technology, that's not something we can have control directly, but we know. We can't give up and we know we need to continue to work hard with all these different parties to make sure we all give it our best. If we give up now, there's definitely no way for it to happen. But if we keep trying one day it will be. And I believe one day we'll all be there.

Karen Walker:

Good to hear. I like that word conviction. I think we're going to need a lot of that with this issue. But as I say, fantastic to see what you're doing at Cathay, and congratulations again on being the ATW Eco Airline of the Year. Lovely to talk with you. Thank you for your time.

Grace Cheung:

Thank you again. And that has been a great recognition and a great encouragement to all of us here at Cathay, and thank you again.

It is seen as requiring large amounts of capital expenditure and a long development cycle. But this idea is out of date, says Julien Fredonie, head of Europe and Africa for Honda Xcelerator Ventures (HXV), the CVC unit of Japanese carmaker Honda.

“ I think there are some misconceptions on this specific field of venture development and investment,” Fredonie tells GCV on the CVC Unplugged podcast.

“Of course, if you think about space quantum fusion, very extreme cases, development cycles are very long. I think a lot of findings in some recent reports showed that the time to market, the time to return as an investment [for hard-tech], were very similar to other investment categories, and more traditional startups,” he says.

HXV’s European portfolio includes hard-tech companies like battery recycling startup Tozero, biogas energy generation company Reverion and sustainable aviation fuel producer Ineratec, the latter of which has for the past year been developing a power-to-liquid synthetic e-fuel manufacturing plant.

Exciting geographies

Fredonie says Europe is well placed for hard tech innovation, with its concentration of high-quality research institutes and engineering companies.

“ One of the specifics of Europe is actually this high decentralisation of the talents, therefore of the great startups. You have amazing startups doing amazing things, even in small villages sometimes,” he says

“I think Europe is very, very strong, very well equipped. A lot of great founders. The companies here attract attention now from VCs and CVCs from all around the world.”

There are still some challenges, Fredonie admits. “How to scale sometimes, how to think global from the very start. That sometimes can be a challenge. But in general, I think Europe is very well equipped to work on some of the big problems around energy transition, ageing population health, et cetera.”

Similarly, says Fredonie, Africa is an exciting and dynamic region partly due to its own widely distributed talent base, adding that even with something like the AI boom, Africa was ahead of the game, with AI M&A activity having taken place as far back as 2021.

“It’s a lot of very different ecosystems with very different hubs and languages. It’s a very complex ecosystem to navigate,” he says.

“Historically it has been a lot of business model innovation, entrepreneurs trying to fix value chains, which were somehow broken, and creating very interesting businesses around that.”

Narrowing funding gap

There is also reason to be optimistic about the narrowing of the notorious funding gap in deeptech – the fallow area between early-stage VC and growth-stage capital where startups tend to struggle.

“What we see in the latest reports is that CVCs in 2024 have started to come a bit later, so the average involvement was around the series B, whereas a couple of years ago, they were going more in the late seed and series A.”",https://globalventuring.com//content/uploads/2025/04/BACKGROUNDS-FOR-HERO-IMAGES-2.png,N,,2025-04-10 09:56:35.784970

The document outlines policy proposals for their legislative term until early 2029, with the agreement paving the way for CDU head Friedrich Merz to be sworn in as Germany's next chancellor in early May.

The parties agreed to stick to Germany's 2045 target to become climate neutral, to reduce energy prices to increase competitiveness and ramp up investments in the country's ailing infrastructure.

Key climate and energy plans in 2025 coalition agreement

Climate policy and energy targets

Commitment to German and European climate targets

Emissions reductions are needed to reach climate neutrality, as well as offsets and, ""to a limited extent, through highly qualified and credible CO2 reductions in non-European partner countries""

Support EU target for 90 percent emissions reduction by 2040 if CO2 reductions in international countries can be counted to meet three percentage points of Germany's own reduction goal

Stick to the agreed coal phase-out deadline of 2038 at the latest

Carbon pricing is the central component for climate protection and competitiveness

Pragmatic implementation of the circular economy strategy

Give CO2 revenues back to households and industry

""Additional” efforts would be made to achieve “permanent and sustainable” negative emissions, with Direct Air Capture is mentioned as a “possible future technology” to contribute to this goal.

Industry and business

Introduce a ""Germany fund"" worth at least 10 billion euros of public money for investments in the country

Prices for companies and households should be reduced by at least five cents per kilowatt hour (average power price in 2024 was 41.2 ct/kWh for households and 20.5 ct/kWh for non-households).

The electricity tax will be cut to the European minimum and grids and levies be reduced as well, ideally with a permanent cap on grid fees.

Energy-intensive companies that cannot be supported otherwise and lack flexibility in adapting their operations will get access to a special industry power price.

Create lead markets for climate-friendly products through quotas for low-emissions steel production or public procurement regulations

Continue with funding programmes for the decarbonisation of industry, including ""climate contracts""

Support projects for the extraction of critical raw materials in Europe + create a national raw materials fund

Steel industry is of central strategic importance for Germany, “we will keep it and make it future-proof, and support it in the transformation of production processes on the way to cliate neutrality”

The parties reject the splitting of Germany’s uniform power price bidding zone.

Germany’s national Supply Chain Act (Lieferkettengesetz) will be abolished and replaced with a law on international corporate responsibility that implements the EU’s due diligence directive CSDDD.

Lead markets for climate friendly or climate neutral products should be established through quotas for the low-emission production of steel, a green gas quota or public procurement regulations.

Renewables and power system

Renewable power installations should be made ready to fully finance themselves on the market. The further expansion and the installation of adequate storage capacity likewise should be achieved through “a greater use of market instruments.”

Support should be made more conducive to stabilizing the power system by integrating storage units and feed-in mechanisms. Private household should get easier access to installing solar PV and the dual-use principle, for example for agriculture and solar power, should be expanded.

Spatial needs for wind power will be re-evaluated for the time after 2032 and nearby communities better integrated in planning procedures. Direct access options for citizens and companies should also be strengthened. Cooperation with North Sea neighbour countries should be intensified to achieve an optimised installation pattern for offshore wind turbines.

Up to 20 GW of new gas-fired back-up power plants should be built through “technology-open auctions as soon as possible.” The plants should be constructed at existing plant locations to balance regional needs. Reserve power plants in the future no longer should only help bridge supply gaps but also serve to regulate power prices.

A “technology-open and market-oriented” capacity mechanism should provide a “system-supporting technology mix” of including bioenergy, combined-heat-and-power plants, storage units and flexibility options.

Cooperation mechanisms for renewables expansion between the states and the federal government will be continued to facilitate Energy infrastructure planning. The principle of reduced environmental regulation for the construction of renewables will be assessed to also accelerate the construction of other infrastructure needed for the energy transition.

Hydrogen, carbon capture

Ramp up the hydrogen economy, using all colours in the run-up (for example hydrogen produced with renewables, nuclear, gas)

Adopt legislative package ""immediately after the beginning of the legislative period"" to enable the capture, transport, utilisation and storage of carbon dioxide (CCS/CCU) for industrial processes where emissions are hard to avoid, as well as for gas-fired power plants

Enable CO2 storage offshore in North Sea continental shelf as well as onshore ""where geologically suitable and accepted""

Direct air capture is a potential technology for negative emissions

Transport

“Clear commitment” to the car industry and jobs, based on “technology neutrality”

We welcome electrification of vehicle fleets, but reject legal quotas

Not mentioned in the text: Reversal of 2035 EU combustion engine phaseout, speed limit on the country’s motorways

“We will support e-mobility using purchase incentives” and additionally via: tax incentives for company and private electric cars, exempt e-cars from car tax until 2035, support programme for low income households for switching to e-mobility, support for plug-in hybrids and electric cars with range extender

More support for broad rollout of charging infrastructure for cars and trucks

Support for a “hydrogen charging” network for trucks

Check how to support switch of existing car factories to armament production

Increase rail investments

Speed up rail electrification

Make driving licenses cheaper

Support walking and cycling as part of sustainable mobility

Speed up permitting of heavy duty road transport

Move more freight transport from roads onto rails

Reverse aviation tax increase

Immediately abolish aviation power to liquid quota that exceeds EU rules

Ensure that European airlines are not disadvantaged in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) quota

Buildings and heating

Introduce a ""new buildings energy act"" (Germany's law to phase out oil and gas boilers) that is ""open to technology, more flexible and simpler"" to modernise Germany's heating supply. ""Achievable CO2 avoidance is to become the central control parameter""

Simplify communal heat planning

Continue to subsidise renovation and heating systems

Strengthen urban development, combat vacancies and adapt city centres and social infrastructure to climate change

Use the potential of serial and modular construction to speed up construction

Introduce end-of-waste regulation to increase the use of recycled construction materials

Draw up an action plan for bio-based building materials and an action plan for energy-intensive building materials

Incentivise simple, climate-friendly construction through funding programmes by state bank KfW

Establish a federal research centre for climate-neutral and resource-efficient construction together with the federal states of Saxony and Thuringia, secure permanent funding

Develop Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a central instrument for the digitalisation of the construction industry

Implement the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), extend implementation deadlines

Climate adaptation

Implement the climate adaptation strategy, use existing funding programmes

Put financing for climate adaptation ""on solid footing"" with federal states, examine making this a ""joint task""

Accelerate flood and coastal protection measures

Implement prioritised measures of Germany's water strategy and continue to develop it further

EU and international

Support the introduction of ETS II, ensure a smooth transition from national carbon pricing to European system from 2027

The agriculture sector will not be made subject to the EU’s ETS 2 regulation.

These sustainable fuels can directly replace conventional kerosene made from fossil fuel with no need for adaptations in aircraft or supply infrastructure, facilitating the immediate decarbonisation of air transportation.

The new facility, located at the Holcim factory in Villaluenga de la Sagra (Toledo), is designed to capture over 700 000 tpy of CO2 during cement production. Part of this CO2 will be combined with green hydrogen produced from renewable energy to be converted into sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF), reaching an estimated production of 100 000 tpy. The remaining CO2 will be stored permanently in geological repositories.

The combination of technology and production capacity for the fuel of the future of aviation positions ECO2FLY as a leader in Europe for the decarbonisation of key development sectors considered difficult to decarbonise. In this context, Over the first 10 years of operation, ECO2FLY will avoid emissions of over 6.5 million t of CO2.

Ricardo de Pablos, CEO of Holcim España, said, “This strategic alliance between IGNIS P2X and Exolum represents a decisive step forward as part of our commitment to the transformation and decarbonisation of the industry. Not only are we making progress on reducing the carbon emissions of our own processes, but we are also driving a key innovation for construction in the form of cement with a total carbon reduction”.

In this regard, Ignacio Casajús, Global Strategy & Growth Lead at Exolum, highlighted how “Exolum is making a firm commitment to the development of partnerships that allow the development of sustainable fuels that, as of today, are presented as the only viable solution to reducing carbon emissions in the short term in sectors like aviation and shipping”.

José Antonio Membiela, CEO of IGNIS P2X, considers this project “the most important in the production of synthetic aviation fuel currently produced in Spain, both in terms of size and strategic location and the circularity it offers partners (energy, CO2 capture, methanol production and consumption in aviation). ECO2FLY combines the sustainability of a business of great important to the surrounding area, such as the cement industry, with the creation of new industry for decarbonisation, which will generate employment and wealth for the region.

For his part, Javier Esteban, Director of the Consortium and Partner of P2X Spain, states that “this project is an opportunity to be leaders in Europe in the production of eSAF, which represents an enormous strategic value for the Spanish economy. It will be the start of a new industry that will create employment and wealth, and a new energy paradigm for the country, with the opportunity to become exporters of renewable fuel on a large scale for the first time.”

Laia Barbarà, Head, Climate Strategy - Net Zero, World Economic Forum: Aviation is one of the greatest humankind inventions. However, our most important journey just yet is to decarbonize the sector.

Robin Pomeroy, host, Radio Davos: Welcome to Radio Davos, the podcast from the World Economic Forum that looks at the biggest challenges and how we might solve them. This week can air travel ever be environmentally sustainable?

Justin Erbacci, Director General, Airports Council International World: To have aviation become more sustainable is a very complex topic. Nobody in the industry can wave a magic wand or work very hard and accomplish carbon neutrality or sustainability by themselves. They really need to have everybody in the industry working collaboratively.

Robin Pomeroy: We hear about the technologies that could decarbonise aviation.

Paul Griffiths, CEO, Dubai Airports: One of the ways forward is clearly sustainable aviation fuel. At the moment, however, this only accounts for 0.7% of the total fuel production. That means that the entire SAF production would be consumed in 50 hours during the course of a whole year.

Robin Pomeroy: We speak to a company that is making jet fuel using carbon dioxide emitted by industry.

Ayesha Choudhury, Chief Commercial Officer, Infinium: You're taking that CO2 from a steel mill, from an ethanol plant, from a pulp and paper, from oil refining. We're capturing that and we're using that as our feedstock

Robin Pomeroy: Follow Radio Davos wherever you get your podcasts, or visit wef.ch/podcasts where you will also find our sister programmes, Meet the Leader and Agenda Dialogues.

I’m Robin Pomeroy at the World Economic Forum, and with this look at how we make aviation sustainable…

This is Radio Davos

Robin Pomeroy: Welcome to Radio Davos. And this week we're talking about sustainable aviation. And later in the program we'll be hearing from the person who runs one of the world's busiest airports, from a company that makes aviation fuel by using carbon captured from industry, and from the head of the global airport organisation, the Airports Council International.

And to co-host this episode on sustainable aviation, joining me is Laia Barbarà. Hi,Laia. How are you?

Laia Barbarà: Hello, Robin. Happy to be here with you.

Robin Pomeroy: Tell us what you do at the World Economic Forum.

Laia Barbarà: So, Robin here, I head the climate strategy team, which includes the sustainable mobility work that we do, including in particular the aviation de-carb portfolio that we're going to be talking about today.

Robin Pomeroy: And you were telling me before, you've got a background in aviation.

Laia Barbarà: Yes. I'm not only an aviation geek, but also an aerospace engineer by background..

Robin Pomeroy: Perfect. So but you cover a lot of industries, though, in your brief. So give us an idea of why aviation is important when it comes to global carbon emissions and, you know, the energy transition and all that.

Laia Barbarà: So aviation is one of the greatest humankind inventions, right? It allows the economy to grow. It allows families to get together, cultures to be exposed to others. And businesses are being made through meetings of people travelling by air oftentimes.

However, our most important journey just yet is to decarbonize the sector.

And if we look back, we can see that the transition from coal to oil to gas took us around 60 years. And the bad news is that we cannot afford another 60 years to decarbonize the aviation sector now.

So we get to look at what are the low hanging fruits while we develop the more permanent solutions.

Robin Pomeroy: As we'll hear in those three interviews that I mentioned earlier, there are actually lots of ways to approach decarbonising aviation or making aviation sustainable. I mean, what would you say are the most important or the most interesting ones?

Laia Barbarà: If you allow me, I'll start by sizing the problem that we're trying to tackle here.

So on one side, sustainable aviation just five years ago was an oxymoron pretty much for everyone. And today we already have solutions deployed at scale. So that's that's already a good a good start.

And then on the other side, if we look at the air traffic growth, we know that it is projected to double by 2042. And just to give you an indication and how it looks like, the forecasted traffic this year, it's expected to exceed the 12 billion passengers. So that's what we're talking about.

And then you were asking me what are the solutions? Well, now that we know the challenge, I think that the solutions, first of all, starts by understanding that the problem is not flying. The problem is CO2. So how can we tackle the CO2? How can we decouple it from this growth that is projected while we continue flying and exploring this beautiful world.

So we have short-term solutions and long-term ones, and we have we got to do a bit of a choreography to balance them and change from one to the other.

What is available today? Today you can fly on certain percentages of sustainable aviation fuels. You may have heard of SAFs. That's how we refer to them.

Robin Pomeroy: Yes. And in fact, we're going to hear quite a few acronyms from these. SAF is the one that keeps coming up, sustainable aviation fuels. You'll probably mention a couple of others now.

Laia Barbarà: Exactly. So SAF today. But it's it's not the perfect solution just yet because we need more SAF and better quality SAF. But it's available today and that's something very important to have to flag.

Then we have what we call destination technologies, the true zero technologies. And those are basically categorised in two big buckets. One, electric aviation. We know that it is possible. We know that hopefully within the next decade we will have some examples in place. But shorter range, less autonomy, less passengers, probably so not fit for purpose for every single type of travel.

Robin Pomeroy: Like battery-operated planes.

Laia Barbarà: Exactly. And then on the other side, the hydrogen sister solution. And this is two-fold: hydrogen fuel cells or hydrogen-fuelled aircrafts. And then those may allow you to have greater autonomy, bigger distances, greater ranges, but probably will penetrate the market just a bit later on.

Robin Pomeroy: Now, the reason we making this episode right now is because you produced this paper called the Global Aviation Sustainability Outlook. Tell us what that is.

Laia Barbarà: So we just learned during Aviation Day in our headquarters here in Geneva, this 2025, our flagship sustainable aviation report that basically tells CEOs how to go about it.

So the issue is as follows. There are many solutions. Not of them are available now. However, CEOs and big decision makers need to make investments today that will lock them up into a particular solution for the next decade, if not longer, right? Depending on the type of assets they're investing in. So we want to help them. We want to shed some light into what are no regrets moves, while we also give a snapshot of where is the sector today when it comes to their companies. And, b, what are the main risks that CEOs perceive? So after having interviewed more than 40 CEOs from the industry, we know I can reveal to you and please, I encourage you to go read the paper as well, that one of the biggest top of mind problems risks that a CEO see is the lack of feedstock availability and the cost of this feedstock to create the so-called SAF, sustainable aviation fuel.

Robin Pomeroy: There's this kind of a chicken and egg problem, isn't there, that an airline might want to buy this fuel, sustainable aviation fuel, but it's not being produced in enough quantities and at a cost that is really affordable. But then the companies making that need to know there's a market there. I suppose that's maybe where the World Economic Forum comes in, because it brings together, famously, the stakeholders of one end and the other, as well as regulators and governments.

Laia Barbarà: Exactly. So we're trying to break the eggs and make a tortilla, if that, if that makes sense. And how do we do that? So we basically get together, as you were saying, everyone along the value chain. And that includes stakeholders from airports, from airlines, from freight forwarders as well as financiers, the fuel producers, but also the suppliers, literally everyone, policy makers, international organisations, industry associations. We've got to do a joint choreography in order to achieve the, the decarbonization of this sector. Because if there's one certainty, Robin, it is that in 2025 politics may have changed, but science has not.

Robin Pomeroy: Let's talk a little bit about the politics. Particularly in the US. Climate action is certainly kind of off the agenda, to say the very least. But aviation is a global thing and US firms are involved globally and as we'll hear, the company, the one particular company we talk to that makes sustainable aviation fuel is making it, as we'll hear, in Texas, oil country.

This is a long term thing. Climate change is a long term problem. Aviation if you're in it, is a long term investment. You buy planes that will last 20,30 years. Airports, building them decades, decades in advance. So is that why people are not turning away from climate action, even if right now, as we speak, it's not the most fashionable thing let's say.

Laia Barbarà: A very unique thing from aviation is that it is a global business by nature. Because let's say that the country a does not supply these sustainable fuels, but then the plane will land elsewhere. And if these other country does supply the fuel, they will refuel there, right? So yeah, then the emissions happen in the atmosphere, which technically do not necessarily belong to a given country.

So I think that just by definition, it is a very global business. It's a global problem and we should try to avoid, and that's something that the World Economic Forum through our Airports Of Tomorrow initiative, we're trying to contribute to and advance the agenda, is to avoid having a patchwork of policies whereby every single country imposes, sometimes even contradictory policies when it comes to the decarbonnization of the sector. So trying to bring everyone onto this level playing field where we can just accelerate the decarb of the sector, because there's one thing you may want to take into consideration, which is we're not only trying to solve the problem of today, but we were saying at the beginning of this interview that air traffic growth is projected to double by 2042.

There's regions very hungry, flying and flying. It's a huge economic growth vector and catalyse the right. So think about the biggest economies in Africa. Think about Southeast Asia and Eastern Asia. The air traffic growth is going to happen there. It's just impressive. And they do have the means to actually produce this fuel. So it also comes as an economic opportunity in order to diversify their economy and reduce the dependency of kerosene imports, for instance.

Robin Pomeroy: Let's get to these interviews. I did these a few weeks ago at the thing that you mentioned. You had an event here at the World Economic Forum called Aviation Day, and this is your Spanish omelette, where you brought together all the ingredients from the industry. So what was that?

Laia Barbarà: So Aviation Day here in Geneva 2025. It was the second edition that we were doing this gathering here where we get CEOs, top executives from across the aviation sector. They are all members of our Airports Of Tomorrow initiative. So more than 80 stakeholders across the value chain.

And what do we do? Well, we try to discuss the speed and scale that we need to move forward and agree on concrete steps forward. So it's less of a ceremonial meeting where somebody tells you the answer and the great things they've done. But it's more of a collective brain power exercise that this executive conducting a closed door setting. So we're left very excited and hopeful.

Robin Pomeroy: So let's get to these interviews. And the first one is Paul Griffiths. He's the CEO of Dubai Airports. And Dubai's a pretty significant airport I think. Right?

Laia Barbarà: Exactly. So actually Dubai is the world's busiest international hub. I think this year they had record number of passengers with over 90 million passengers passing through the airport. Quite, quite impressive. And they also have plans to increase even this capacity further, up to 200 million passengers per year at Dubai International, a different airport in the city.

Robin Pomeroy: Yeah, he mentions that new airport that they're building. This is Paul Griffiths.

Paul Griffiths, CEO, Dubai Airports

Paul Griffiths: The key to making aviation sustainable is first to understand the scale of the problem.

The first point is that the aviation industry consumes about 1.08 million tonnes of aviation fuel every day, and in 2024 that grew by 68,000 tonnes per day. So it's a very, very big concern.

One of the ways forward is clearly sustainable aviation fuel.

At the moment, however, this only accounts for 0.7% of the total fuel production. That means that the entire SAF production would be consumed in 50 hours during the course of a whole year.

So you can see the scale of the problem.

What we're trying to do is encourage investment in sustainable aviation fuel. The global jet fuel market is worth about $254 billion per year. If we were able to put, say, $1 on every barrel of oil, that would make a difference of about 0.8% in the cost of fuel, then we could reinvest in SAF production to try and equalise both the cost and the volume production to accelerate it. Using Moore's Law, doubling the production of SAF every two years, it would take 7.7 years to get to 10% of total jet fuel being from sustainable sources. So it's a very big problem. It needs a big solution and it needs huge investment, which I believe could be raised somehow from the industry.

Robin Pomeroy: Would you say that it's more an economic or a policy question rather than a technical question at this point?

Paul Griffiths: I think there are three elements in making SAF a quantifiable problem-solver for the future.

I think, first of all, the industry and governments have got to work together to create a level playing field of investment that doesn't incentivise poor behaviour. In other words, if there is a levy on aviation fuel or on ticket prices such as applied in Singapore, just under 2 USD per passenger towards SAF production, then we could actually solve the problem if that was applied on a global basis. There are precedents for this. There's the Chicago Agreement, which agreed many decades ago that there would be no global tax on aviation fuel. If we could have a simple agreement to say this, a levy on jet fuel, then we could fund scale of SAF production. That, I think is the way forward.

However, this would result in costs having to be passed on to the consumer, but I think it's only possible and justifiable to say that really, the consumer should meet the fully sustainable supply chain costs of every good or service that we consume.

Robin Pomeroy: Now you represent an airport rather than an airline. So different priorities, different challenges. What are the challenges for an airport looking to become more sustainable?

Paul Griffiths: Clearly, sustainability in airport terms is limited to the emissions that we produce on the ground - about 10% of the total emissions in the industry.

There are many ways of actually achieving a sustainable ground operation. The first is to use electric vehicles throughout the airport environment, which is something that Dubai Airports, we're embracing.

The second is to concentrate on alternative energy sources. We've installed 62,000 solar panels across all the rooftops at Dubai International Airport. Those are producing 60MW of solar power.

We are controlling all of our production and cooling infrastructure so that we can consume significantly less electricity. We are engaging in predictive maintenance. We're aiming to send zero waste to landfill within two years. We've eliminated single use plastics. We are looking at all sorts of new nascent technologies to make the airport as sustainable as we possibly can.

My philosophy is, rather than setting a target, let us do a whole range of incremental movements so I can look month by month and see that we've actually made positive progress by not emitting as much CO2 as we did in the previous month. It has to be practical. There's no silver bullet and it needs a myriad of different solutions.

Robin Pomeroy: And where do airports come in when it comes to this transition to sustainable aviation fuels, what role do you play in that?

Paul Griffiths: The transition to sustainable aviation fuel is a complex one. And as airports plan decades ahead, it's going to be very difficult to understand exactly what's needed in ten years time. We are due to open our new airport, Dubai World Central – Al Maktoum International, within the next seven years. And the idea is to have a fuel infrastructure that will cater for whatever alternative aviation fuels, be it hydrogen, be it methane, be it sustainable aviation fuel grown from HEFA [hydrotreated esters and fatty acids] or from power to liquid, or the myriad of nascent technologies clearly have got to mature. We've got to look at encouraging innovation and development at scale in this area and be ready to accommodate whichever solution emerges as the chosen one.

Robin Pomeroy: Do you think there will be a solution that emerges as a chosen one. because there are, you just listed, a lot of them there. They're almost competing, I suppose, at the moment. Do you imagine they'll be in ten years time? Oh, it will seem obvious. We should all put all our bets on solution A. Or do you think in ten years time, they'll still be a whole range of ways of powering aircraft?

Paul Griffiths: I think what is going to happen with energy transition is we'll go through a number of phases. And clearly there is from the present day to the future, where we've got to use a drop-in fuel to work with existing aviation technology and existing aero engines.

Clearly, SAF is the one that looks as though it's going to be in the near-term the best way of achieving that.

However, in the longer term, methane and hydrogen look as though they could be better alternatives, either in hydrogen fuel cells powering electric engines - and there are now already some very powerful, self-sustaining engines powered by hydrogen that could perhaps power a 50-80-seat aircraft, so that technology is very interesting. So I think the thing is, there will be a solution that takes us incrementally from where we are today. But in the longer term, there's likely to be an emergent energy source that will be the front runner.

In any engineering solution there's usually one long term winner. And if I was asked to say where we going to go, I think probably hydrogen has the greatest promise.

Robin Pomeroy: Do you think consumers will notice this change? And do you think consumers are asking for this change?

Paul Griffiths: I think it's inevitability that consumers will have to respond and understand that aviation may not be quite as cost effective, because today we are clearly not absorbing all the costs necessary to make aviation completely sustainable. It has to be met from a source and clearly if it's spread across the whole world, consumers shouldn't notice too much difference if the cost of sustainability is embedded into the aviation supply chain.

Robin Pomeroy: That was Paul Griffiths, the CEO of Dubai Airports. Let's get straight to the second one. We are moving continents from the Middle East. We're going over to North America and this is Ayesha Choudhury. She is the chief commercial officer at a company called Infinium. What does Infinium do?

Laia Barbarà: So Infinium is an innovator a company that it's producing sustainable aviation fuels that what we call e fuels, which is basically synthetic aviation fuels the type of high quality stuff that exists today, less mature technology pathways. So it comes with higher risk, higher technology demands, but also a higher sustainability criteria. So very exciting to see them growing and taking off.

Robin Pomeroy: This is Ayesha Choudhury of Infinium.

Ayesha Choudhury, Chief Commercial Officer at Infinium

Robin Pomeroy: So sustainable aviation fuel, what actually is it? I'm imagining it's a lot of different things potentially.

Ayesha Choudhury: You're absolutely right. It is a lot of different things potentially. But at its core, however you make it, it's a drop-in fuel. It's chemically identical to its fossil fuel counterpart, jet fuel, but it comes with a much lower carbon footprint.

There's a lot of ways that you can make it. Some are more technologically advanced than others.

Today we have very little of this stuff, and what little of it there is is made from used cooking oils, fats and greases. That's kind of like the first generation of SAF.

There's new and emerging pathways, one of which is power to liquids or E fuels, E being electricity. That's what the E stands for in E fuels.

What we do is we make SAF, the same product chemically identical to the fossil fuel. So you can use it in the same planes. You can distribute it in the same exact way as regular jet fuel, but make it with a more than 90% greenhouse gas savings. We do that because we're making it from renewable power, water and waste CO2 that otherwise would have been in the atmosphere.

Robin Pomeroy: Could you kind of talk us through in non-experts terms how this stuff is made?

Ayesha Choudhury: Yeah, absolutely. So basically, jet fuel is a chain or set of molecules that are made from hydrogen and carbon. The vast majority of the jet fuel that gets made today, that hydrogen and carbon comes from petroleum that we drill from under the ground.

But we don't actually have to get that carbon and hydrogen from the ground. We can find other sources for it.

So the source that we use is the carbon that's in CO2, and then the hydrogen that's in water. And we have a process, you know, a fancy sausage machine, a lot of very important technology and technological innovation that went into it, but very simply, you put those two ingredients and there's a way to break up those molecules and put Humpty Dumpty back together in the exact formation of jet fuel.

Robin Pomeroy: We hear a lot about hydrogen as a fuel as well, which is different from this. So you could, and probably the first step that you were talking about there, splitting hydrogen out of water. But the problem there, I suppose, is that you can't just put that into a jet engine, right?

Ayesha Choudhury: Not yet. I mean, that's something that people are working on. And hopefully there's a path for that and there's a long future.

But you're absolutely right that hydrogen is where the power is, if you will. And what we're doing is we're synthetically creating that hydrogen from the water and the CO2.

We're able, because we're making a molecule that looks and feels exactly like jet fuel or almost like it, it can go into the same plane. So the big difference here is that there is no changeover for the fleet that's required. There's no changeover in the infrastructure. You can essentially increase a lot of asset life of existing infrastructure, where lots and lots of people put investment into this, by using this method of decarbonising.

It's a circular solution. So if you asked how does it work when you use the fuel, you combust it in an aeroplane engine, just like you would do the fossil fuel stuff. And so it'll emit CO2 because it's chemically identical. It's going to work the same way. The difference is that the CO2 that it emits, one way to think about it was going to be in the atmosphere anyway. So what you're doing as a part of our process, you're taking that CO2 from a steel mill, from an ethanol plant, from a pulp and paper, from oil refining, there's lots and lots of sources of CO2 emissions. We're capturing that and we're using that as our feedstock. So you're not adding more CO2 to the environment that there wouldn't have already been.

Robin Pomeroy: And I think you use the expression a drop-in fuel.

Ayesha Choudhury: That's right.

Robin Pomeroy: What does that mean exactly?

Ayesha Choudhury: Drop-in fuel. Really what it means is that it's the same thing as the other stuff. So you don't have to have any changes to the engines. You don't have to change the planes. You don't have to change over your fleet. Plans are expensive, and we use them for decades before we swap them out or retire them. So the idea that you can have a fuel that works exactly the same way, handles the same way, but it's not made the same way. So you can get it with a lower carbon footprint.

Robin Pomeroy: It sounds amazing. Why are we not all flying using this fuel right now. What are the problems?

Ayesha Choudhury: One day I hope we will be. That's for sure. That's a vision for the future.

What this particular type of SAF, this power-to-liquid SAF, offers is the ability to scale that the other pathways don't have.

We should make everything that we can. Let's be honest. Decarbonisation of aviation is a massive challenge. There's a lot of stakeholders involved. There's a lot that we have to do. It requires a lot of scaling.

Why aren't we all doing it now? Today it's more expensive than fossil fuel. Now fossil fuel, it has its own set of subsidies. So there's a lot of debate as to like what's parity and what's not. But leaving that aside, today, all of the SAFs, all the ways that you can make it, are more expensive than today's fossil jet fuel. One of the things that we work on at Infinium is to bring down the cost.

We look at every aspect of how we can do that. We continue to invest in R&D to see if we can have a cheaper process. We run the world's first operating facility making E fuels today in Corpus Christi. So we'll have on the ground experience learning how to do this, how to optimise processes, how to make this, again, as cheaply as we can.

And we're building more facilities that are larger in scale, where you can get some economies of scale. We're doing everything we can to bring the cost down, but certainly it's not something that's happening overnight.

Robin Pomeroy: If the money was there to invest in this, it could be scaled up now.

Ayesha Choudhury: Yeah, actually, you know, I don't think the bottleneck is money. There is lots of money for good deals. We have capital commitments from a number of our investors who are there to fund the next plants and the next plant after that. They're all very interested in deploying capital to do this because there is, you know, people talk about the cost of energy transition. It's also an opportunity to invest, right?

I would say the large bottleneck to scaling is more about regulatory certainty and the types of bankable off-takes that capital partners need in order to actually finance these facilities. They're not cheap to build. They cost hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars, even so, having revenue certainty in addition to de-risking the technology, demonstrating that yes, it's new, but it works.

And we have this plant in Corpus Christi which is showing that it is very real, that it's integrated with other parts, other technologies, and it all works from soup to nuts. And that at the end you get the fuel that you can put straight into a vehicle.

You also need long term, predictable revenue, and that's partially coming from your off takers. But that's enabled by policy policy certainty saying that, you know, like for example, there's a mandate to use PTL [power-to-liquids] SAF in the UK, in the EU. That type of policy certainty is really important for off takers to be able to commit to the long term agreements that are necessary to get these plants built.

Robin Pomeroy: Tell us about your operations. What would I see if I came to your plant?

Ayesha Choudhury: If you went to go look at our plant, you would look at it and you'd say, oh, this looks just like any other chemical plant or oil refinery. There's lots of big metal vessels. There's lots of tubes. It kind of looks like any other petrochemical refinery.

Our plant in Corpus Christi is a full 24/7 operating facility. We have the full process safety management. You wouldn't know to look at it. Oh, these guys are turning sun, air and water into jet fuel.

So our first plant been operating for more than a year now. And our second plant is even bigger than that. And it's also in Texas. It's in West Texas. It's called Project Roadrunner. If our project in Corpus Christi was the world's first, this project Roadrunner is going to be the world's second E fuels facility.

We have capital commitments from Brookfield Asset Management, who's committed $1.1 billion to our platform overall. They're funding this project and they made a commitment to the next one even after that. Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, Bill Gates's climate fund, has also made a commitment to invest in this project. And of course, Infinium has a number of investors who are also indirectly in this project. And so we have an anchor offtake from American Airlines and IAG, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, a few more that aren't yet public.

But basically what we've been able to do is to start to scale up this industry to bring the cost down, and we've been able to do it with a commercial structure, long term feedstock agreements, long term bankable offtake agreements that attract the type of very, you know, large tech riders that are required to finance these types of very large infrastructure projects.

Robin Pomeroy: It's almost ironic, isn't it, that this is happening in Texas, you know, big oil country and also in the US, climate action is not really on the agenda of the current administration, but this is going ahead. What gives you the confidence that it can survive the variations in the political attitudes towards climate change and the energy transition?

Ayesha Choudhury: Sure. That's a really fair question. There's one thing to keep in mind when we think about Texas, or we think about doing these types of projects wherever they are in the United States, and specifically in a very red state like Texas. Yes, we are a sustainable fuel. Yes, we are a part of energy transition, but we're also bringing jobs to the area. We're generating economic prosperity in the communities that we operate in. We're creating resilient supply chains where you make fuels. There is a production pathway where you don't have to be in Texas. You make your own in a lot of places. So yes, the US is already energy independent because of our oil and gas reserves, but there's plenty of other places in the world where we can deploy this type of technology that don't have that. So energy independence and resilience are also an important part of it. But certainly in Texas we're bringing jobs and we think, you know, that that's part of it too.

Robin Pomeroy: Do you think this will expand in other parts of the world?

Ayesha Choudhury: Absolutely. We have a project portfolio beyond this plants one and two. We have more than a dozen projects in our portfolio. Some are in the public domain already. Our project pipeline is roughly 50% US, 50% rest of world. We have some projects that we're developing in Europe in particular, but certainly the technology is absolutely fungible. It can be done in a number of locations.

Robin Pomeroy: And you also need customers or offtakers. What's in it for them to buy this fuel which, I'm not gonna be crass enough to ask you how much more expensive per litre or gallon it is, feel free to tell me, but what is in it for them to buy this? And how do we know that demand is going to increase?

Ayesha Choudhury: Let's talk about our agreement with IAG, the owner of British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus. There's a mandate to use SAF, sustainable aviation fuel, in the EU. In the UK. There's actually a power to liquid sub-mandate as well. So in addition to just buying any old stuff, you have to specifically use power to liquids off or you face a major penalty. And so it's the policy certainty of the EU and the UK that gave IAG and the other offtakers that we're talking to the confidence to enter into a long term agreement because they know they have to buy this stuff. It may cost them more than the fossil fuel price, but if it cost them less than what the penalty might be for not doing it, there's a strong business case on their end.

Robin Pomeroy: You say, how important is the regulatory environment, that it's predictable, or also that it is supporting the development of sustainable aviation fuel. Are you confident, given the current international climate, that that will continue to support your business?

Ayesha Choudhury: It's a fair question. We live in a more uncertain and and dynamic world than we did before, certainly. It's obviously hard to make very long, large investment decisions in the backdrop of more policy uncertainty. So you're absolutely right that uncertainty makes it not just hard for us, but broadly for the entire industry to do stuff.

It's about scaling, whether it's our technology or whether it's others, we need as much of this stuff as we can get. We are going to need policy certainty to be able to scale up this industry. The good news is that with the scale in certain areas, costs will come down.

Robin Pomeroy: We're talking here at the World Economic Forum, discussions between the regulators, companies, academics even. And then you've got discussions, the international levels all the time thinking of the climate COPs, but also very importantly for the aviation industry, the ICAO. And there are talks going to be happening there. Are there things that you're expecting or hoping might happen in any of those fora which would be important?

Ayesha Choudhury: We want to sit at the table at all of these where policy is getting shaped and people understand the perspective of the producer.

We're in a unique position at Infineon. We have de-risked technology. We've proven that it works. We have investors who are waiting in the wings, ready to deploy serious capital to get these assets built and bend the cost curve.

One big missing ingredient that we need, whichever the policy body is, is continued policy certainty so that our customers can feel comfortable making some of these long term commitments.

Robin Pomeroy: Ayesha Choudhury, the Chief Commercial Officer of Infinium.

Let's go straight to our last, my third and last interview from your Aviation Day. This is the Director-General of Airports Council International World, ACI World, Justin Erbacci. What is ACI World?

Laia Barbarà: So ACI World basically represents more than 2,000 airports across across the world. And they have very strong work being done on the sustainability side of things. Actually, ACI, and Justin in particular, have been instrumental in the conceptualisation and and launch of of our Airports of Tomorrow initiative. They are our strategic partner and have been a great thought leader in getting it off the ground.

Justin Erbacci, Director General. Airports Council International World

Nobody in the industry can wave a magic wand or work very hard and accomplish carbon neutrality or sustainability by themselves. They really need to have everybody in the industry working collaboratively to really move the needle in this area.

We are doing a lot with our airports to to help them to figure out how they can become sustainable. And we have a carbon accreditation program that determines the levels of how well they're doing as far as becoming sustainable. And we work with them to help them figure out how to do that.

Robin Pomeroy: Can you give some examples of what airports are doing that is working to make them more sustainable?

Justin Erbacci: So airports are doing a lot. Airports were one of the first to commit to the 2050 carbon neutrality goal. We have the ACI Airport Carbon Accreditation programme, and there are five levels there, and we have about 600 or so airports that are already accredited, the highest level being level five. We have 19 airports who have already achieved level five.

So airports are mainly focussed in scope one and two areas of carbon neutrality, and that's where they can control what they do at the airport by electrifying their ground equipment, by building sustainable solutions, by making more efficient heating and cooling systems. So there are a number of things that airports can do to address scope one and two carbon goals.

Now, when it comes to scope three, that's where really you need the airlines to do a lot of work there. But airports are doing a lot to help to put in infrastructure that allows the use of SAF and other alternative fuels, and working very closely with the airline counterparts to try to put things in place to make the airport as sustainable as possible.

Robin Pomeroy: So SAF being sustainable aviation fuel. How much of a challenge is it that some of those technologies are still fairly much in their infancy. Is it complex like that for airports?

Justin Erbacci: The use of sustainable aviation fuel of itself is not complex. It is the production of sustainable aviation fuel that is the problem. It's not so much of a technology problem as it is a financial problem.

The manufacturers are ready to make sustainable aviation fuel and are eager to do so. But they need the commitment of the airlines and the industry to purchase that, so that they know that they can get a return on their investment. And that's a little bit challenging, because airlines and others are somewhat hesitant because of the fluctuation of the pricing and the uncertainty of pricing in the future to make long term commitments.

The other alternative aviation fuels electric aircraft, hydrogen aircraft, the technology is not there yet, and so it's very difficult for airports to put in the infrastructure that's required for hydrogen or for electric aircraft, when they don't know exactly what the technology is going to be, or even if it's going to come or when.

So that's another catch 22 that we help and put some papers in place to help our airports when they're doing their planning, to take into consideration the possibility of hydrogen and other fuels down the path. But it's still early as far as knowing when to implement that infrastructure.

Robin Pomeroy: An airport is usually a profit driven entity. It's providing services at a certain cost. What does he get from saying, actually, we are at the forefront of sustainability. Why would they do that?

Justin Erbacci: Well, there's many reasons why. One is that airports exist in a community. And as airports, we want to make sure that we are being good members of the community and trying to mitigate the impacts of air traffic as much as possible in the way of emissions and the way of noise.

The other aspect is, is as the industry grows and continues to grow, we will see that there will be a lot of environmental challenges from communities, from governments.

And so the airports and the airlines need to address these in order to make sure that the growth that we're going to see is going to be sustainable, and we're not creating a worse situation for the environment.

Robin Pomeroy: The Global Aviation Sustainability Outlook, what are we trying to achieve? The World Economic Forum and the partners who are involved in writing that report?

Justin Erbacci: The reason that we all get together at the World Economic Forum is for us to really move the needle in this area. We all need to work collaboratively together. Groups like the World Economic Forum helps us to get together, to have the dialogue, to understand where there's commonality, what are the issues that we need to push, and to gauge where we are in the pursuit of the carbon neutrality. Without these dialogues or these discussions with all of the stakeholders, we're not able to be able to make good path forward.

Robin Pomeroy: Can you give us any examples of those financial or regulatory things that would move the needle?

Justin Erbacci: We've seen that countries that have incented the production of staff have much higher production than those that don't. Pushing governments to provide incentives for that is very important. At some point, we have to figure out how we're going to pay for this. There are different potential ways that that can be done, but they will need regulatory change to either have, you know, some type of a tax or user fee, if that's the path that you want to go.

There is a lot of things that regulators and governments can do to help us achieve our objectives.

Robin Pomeroy: Are you confident that with that time horizon of 2030 or 2050, which are often the years set out in carbon neutral plans that there will be enough around the world support for these measures?

Justin Erbacci: So I think that these recent times we've seen that it's very uncertain as far as what type of support we're going to be getting from from governments and the geopolitical situation. It is very dynamic and changing a lot.

So I think that it's really important that all of us, as a group of stakeholders, continually remind governments and regulators what it is that we believe is necessary for them to do and just keep driving home that message to them to try to get them to take appropriate action.

And our commitment has to be unwavering. We have to make sure that even despite some of the geopolitical pushbacks that exist today and the uncertainty, that we don't veer from our goals and we remain committed to our goals.

Robin Pomeroy: Justin Erbacci is director general of Airports Council International World.

Aviation helps promote economic growth and cultural connection, but it faces a challenge – how can we fly more sustainably? Paired with other mechanisms such as acceptance of book-and-claim, R&D funding, grants and incentive mechanisms, policies like the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate can help us get on the right track.

SAF is an important solution that is available now, commercially proven, and compatible with existing aircraft engine technology. SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to ~80% on a lifecycle basis when compared to conventional jet fuel. However, time is not on our side. The UK SAF mandate, which officially came into effect in January, is an important policy that can help scale SAF. The mandate requires that SAF must make up at least 2% of all fuel used for flights departing the UK this year with targets rising to 10% in 2030 and 22% by 2040.

Meeting the mandate will be challenging. According to the UK Climate Change committee, SAF is expected to account for only 6% of total fuel demand by 2030, falling short of the targeted 10% and underscoring that the mandate alone will not get the UK SAF industry where it needs to be. To drive progress, the mandate mechanism needs to be paired jointly with other policy mechanisms and frameworks and focus on a wide range of technological advancements and operational efficiencies. In line with this, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) recommends a multi-faceted approach to working towards net-zero aviation by 2050. Their policy roadmap calls for a balanced focus on scaling SAF production, addressing infrastructure gaps, enhancing R&D, and driving diversification, scale-up and adoption of new technologies.

From regulation to action

The UK SAF mandate is a call to action for an industry under pressure to work towards net-zero goals. The convergence of regulatory mechanisms and incentives, expanded production capabilities, and increasing demand could signal a turning point.

Meeting SAF targets requires a concerted, industry-wide effort to continue to scale production, develop necessary infrastructure, and create supportive market conditions. The industry must work with all stakeholders including policymakers, fuel suppliers, travelers and others, to achieve this.

How businesses can lead the way

Compared to leisure travel, business travel is a highly influential and concentrated industry. On certain flights, business travellers account for just 12% of passengers but up to 75% of airline revenue, PwC found. This purchasing power, combined with the decisions business travelers make, places the industry in a unique position to help drive the scaling of SAF. In fact, this is already underway. By procuring SAF corporates can help accelerate the production and use of cleaner fuels and reduce their carbon footprint and set a higher standard for the entire aviation industry.

Corporations can fuel SAF adoption through the ""book-and-claim"" model, a streamlined financing and delivery mechanism that simplifies SAF distribution while ensuring accountability for corporate travelers. This model means SAF doesn’t need to be physically available at every airport. Instead, the purchased SAF is “booked” into the fuel system and can be “claimed” on any aircraft - the environmental benefits are still delivered without the additional cost and complexity of delivering fuel to a specific consumer.

Formal government acceptance of book-and-claim for SAF may help avoid additional costs and logistical complexities of importing SAF. Moreover, it may help drive corporate investment in domestic SAF production. Clear and consistent accounting and reporting standards are vital to unlocking long-term investment from corporates for the environmental attributes of SAF, as stated in a white paper by the World Economic Forum.

The journey ahead

While SAF is a crucial element in the journey towards decarbonising aviation, we need a mix of innovative policies and tools to get us there. These approaches include levers such as optimized flight routes and aircraft operations, continued progress in aircraft efficiency, carbon capture technologies, and carbon pricing. According to IATA, the route to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 will be led by SAF, but will also require a combination of new technologies such as electric and hydrogen, infrastructure and operational efficiencies, and offsets and carbon capture solutions.

With advancements in technology and increased investment from both the private and public sectors, 2025 can be a pivotal year for SAF progress. By working together, both governments and corporations can help accelerate the transition from SAF to being a niche solution to a mainstream norm.","http://www.travolution.com/dynamic-images/29000-29999/29908/29908_c=(0,476,6720,3528)_w=1200_h=630.webp?v=20230522122229",N,,2025-04-10 06:56:12.739352

Neste has successfully started producing sustainable aviation fuel (#SAF) at its renewables refinery in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, increasing its global SAF production capability to 1.5 million tons per annum, roughly 1.875 billion liters of SAF. 

“It is clear that we need to continue making progress in mitigating climate change and addressing aviation’s climate impact. Neste is fully committed to supporting its customers in the aviation industry to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and this milestone underlines that commitment,” said Heikki Malinen, President and CEO of Neste.

The Rotterdam refinery has been modified to enable Neste to produce up to 500,000 tons of SAF per annum as part of the existing capacity. Neste also has SAF production capabilities at its refineries in Singapore, currently the world’s largest SAF production facility, and in Porvoo, Finland.

SAF is widely acknowledged as a key lever to reduce aviation emissions but policy support and close cooperation across the whole aviation ecosystem are required to accelerate the energy transition and related emission reductions.

A quiet yet transformative development is unfolding in the world of sustainable aviation. Gevo, a clean energy pioneer, and Future Energy Global (FEG), a market accelerator, have inked a multi-year agreement that has the potential to reshape how airlines and corporates approach carbon reduction. More than just an offtake contract, this is a glimpse into the maturing landscape of Scope 1 and Scope 3 carbon credits, harnessed through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Under the agreement, Future Energy Global will acquire the carbon abatement attributes from 10 million gallons per year of fuel produced at Gevo’s upcoming facility, the ATJ-60. These attributes cover both direct airline emissions (Scope 1) and the indirect emissions linked to business travel (Scope 3). With an option to increase this offtake volume later, the scale and ambition of the agreement reflect an evolving vision for decarbonization beyond physical fuel supply.

Book and Claim: Expanding the Reach of Sustainable Aviation

A noteworthy aspect of this collaboration is its emphasis on the book and claim system. Traditionally used in renewable electricity markets, this approach separates environmental attributes from the physical product. In aviation, this means companies can claim the emissions reduction benefits of SAF even if the fuel is not physically delivered to their location.

This model is crucial because SAF is not universally available at every airport. By decoupling the environmental benefits from fuel logistics, book and claim systems unlock access to a broader, global pool of SAF-derived carbon credits. This enables airlines and corporates alike to bridge the gap between sustainability ambitions and operational realities.

Financing the Future: Infrastructure Powered by Innovation

The commercial logic of this agreement extends well beyond environmental aspirations. For Gevo, the partnership with Future Energy Global provides critical momentum toward financing the construction of its ATJ-60 plant in South Dakota. Backed by a conditional loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy, alongside equity from project-level investors, the facility is designed to produce 60 million gallons of SAF annually.

What stands out is not just the facility’s capacity but its economic proposition. Gevo’s ATJ-60 aims to deliver SAF at a price comparable to conventional jet fuel, but with significantly lower carbon emissions. This parity is a pivotal step toward mainstreaming SAF in an industry where cost competitiveness remains a critical barrier to adoption.

Bridging Scope 1 and Scope 3: A Holistic Approach

One of the understated yet powerful features of this initiative lies in its dual focus on Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions. Airlines, as fuel users, are directly accountable for Scope 1 emissions. Meanwhile, businesses whose employees fly for work bear responsibility for their share of flight-related emissions under Scope 3.

Future Energy Global’s ability to serve both scopes enables a more comprehensive decarbonization strategy. By catering to corporates eager to mitigate travel emissions and airlines looking to align with net-zero targets, this partnership creates a shared value chain of accountability and action.

Scaling Ambitions: Meeting the Urgency of Demand

The aviation sector faces a steep climb toward its 2050 net-zero goal, with estimates suggesting SAF production needs to increase over 400-fold. This is not merely a technical challenge but a financial and systemic one.

Future Energy Global’s business model provides a blueprint for scaling SAF production responsibly. By pre-purchasing SAF credits and commercializing the associated carbon benefits, FEG generates predictable revenue streams. This stability attracts capital and encourages producers like Gevo to expand with confidence. It also grants buyers access to SAF credits at transparent prices, fostering trust in a market that is still gaining maturity.

Enabling Early Movers: Opportunities Beyond Aviation

While the initial focus is on aviation, the implications of this partnership reach further. Future Energy Global is already extending its sustainable fuel credit solutions to marine and land transport sectors. This diversification is vital, as global logistics and freight systems seek to navigate the complex path toward lower emissions.

Moreover, aircraft lessors—who own about half of the commercial fleet globally—stand to benefit. By leveraging book and claim systems, they can contribute meaningfully to emissions reductions, enhancing the environmental profile of their assets while supporting their airline customers.

Conclusion: An Evolving Landscape of Shared Responsibility

The Gevo and Future Energy Global agreement signals a pivotal shift in how industries perceive their role in decarbonization. Beyond merely supplying sustainable fuel, this partnership demonstrates the power of market-based mechanisms to accelerate the energy transition.

Rather than waiting for global SAF infrastructure to catch up, this agreement empowers businesses to take proactive steps now. It blends technological readiness with financial innovation, creating a practical pathway for industries to advance toward climate goals. And perhaps most importantly, it reframes emissions reduction as a shared responsibility—one that spans producers, buyers, investors, and society at large.

As the demand for credible, scalable climate solutions intensifies, initiatives like this provide more than compliance—they offer a blueprint for collaboration, resilience, and sustainable growth.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-45-6-1024x576-1.png,N,,2025-04-10 08:57:07.104863

Carbox, a company of the Tarros Group, continues its journey towards sustainable transport.

The Carbox fleet, consisting of over 200 Euro 6 trucks, is now also powered by Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO), a biofuel of plant origin. HVO fuel reduces emissions by over 80% compared to conventional fuel while maintaining high operational performance standards.

This choice aligns with a broader trend that has led to a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since 1990*, thanks to the use of renewable energy sources and the transition to lower-carbon fuels.

In the first quarter of 2025, Carbox achieved a 25% biofuel usage rate relative to total fuel consumption and deployed 30 trucks running entirely on HVO.

This result was made possible through the synergy between the Carbox Technical Team and the Tarros Group’s Sustainability Office, in line with the ESG strategy pursued by the Group.

Silvano Maggi, Carbox General Manager:

Throughout its 25-year history, Carbox has demonstrated an extraordinary ability to adapt to market evolution and the new demands of sustainable mobility.

We have invested in innovative solutions that combine environmental sustainability with operational efficiency, enabling us to meet the challenges of an ever-evolving industry. The introduction of HVO represents another step forward in our environmental commitment, while also strengthening our position in the market.By working in synergy with our various Italian locations as well as Carbox Morocco and Carbox Egypt, we are able to offer an increasingly competitive, reliable, and sustainable service. We thank our customers for inspiring us to develop new technologies and intermodal solutions to reduce the environmental impact of our operations.”

¦ Chris Rozansky is executive director of the Naples Airport Authority.","A quarter-century into the new millennium, and with Earth Day 2025 approaching, the Naples Airport Authority is ramping up our commitment to increased environmental responsibility and sustainability at the airport.

As an industry leader and community partner, we are passionate about being on the leading edge of aviation sustainability and environmental responsibility.

Our natural environment is an essential part of what makes Southwest Florida so special. We understand the importance of protecting our environment and continuously seek ways to reduce aviation’s local environmental impact.

To that end, we recently began offering UL94 unleaded fuel as an environmentally cleaner alternative to traditional 100LL avgas, and subsidizing the costs, enabling tenants such as our two flight schools to purchase this cleaner fuel. In Florida, just two other public airports offer this alternative. Nationwide, we are one of just 35 to offer UL94.

Also now available is a more sustainable alternative to jet fuel made in part from biomass rather than fossil fuels – think everything from wood pulp and algae to repurposed cooking oil. We project it to account for nearly 20% of the airport’s fuel sales in 2025.

Airport tenant NetJets, the world’s largest private jet operator, deserves credit for its participation. The commitments are significant: per the World Economic Forum, sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to cut aviation’s greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared with traditional jet fuels.

And as the first reliable sustainable aviation fuel supply point on the East Coast, Naples is playing a key role in making the fuel more accessible across the United States.

On the ground, the Naples Airport Authority is committed to taking steps to reduce its environmental impact, including replacing airport ground vehicles with zero-emission electric equipment and vehicles. The latest additions to our electric-powered ground fleet are Ford Lightning trucks and a variety of electric ground support equipment.

Protecting the environment for future generations is the goal, and we are committed to continually improving our sustainability practices.

Additionally, as part of our partnership with the Southwest Florida Land Preservation Trust, Naples Airport has placed large tracts of its land into permanent conservation for the Gordon River Greenway for residents to enjoy for generations to come.

As the work of the trust concludes, we will continue to preserve and maintain portions of the Gordon River Greenway on airport property. The maintenance of this property comes at no cost to city or county taxpayers.

Retention ponds along Airport Road accept runoff from the industrial park to the east, which covers more than 400 acres. In 2015, we modified the larger pond to create a filtering process, so the water leaves the airport in a nearly natural state. Those efforts drew industry recognition such as the Florida Airport Council’s J. Bryan Cooper Environmental Award.

In 2022, Naples Airport was recognized with the Federal Aviation Administration Southern Region Safety Award for its Comprehensive Wildlife Management Program. From enhancing runway drainage to proactive habitat management, this program focuses on protecting Southwest Florida’s native wildlife while ensuring the safety of our pilots and passengers.

Solar panels are being added to facility upgrades, contributing to cleaner energy use and furthering the airport’s sustainability goals.

With regard to noise reduction, we have added a new, free mobile app for residents to submit concerns, and continue to accept noise comments through the website www.flynaples.com/noise-comment and via the dedicated noise hotline at 239-326-9262. Residential noise monitors are also available for installation, by request.

These efforts demonstrate Naples Airport’s leadership in sustainable aviation and community commitment.

Results of soil, water quality and “black soot” investigations

In response to community concerns, the Naples Airport Authority has proactively conducted a series of tests over the years to monitor and confirm the quality of local soil, water and air.

The most recent round of testing, conducted in 2024, further reinforced the airport’s record of environmental safety and quality:

In air sampling conducted at seven locations, both on and off airport property, no detectable traces of lead were found. Additionally, 40 separate soil tests found that lead levels at the airport averaged 2.5 times less than those commonly found along Florida’s roadsides – and were over 800 times below the regulatory threshold for residential exposure.

Tests of airport groundwater samples found lead concentrations 16 times lower than the Environmental Protection Agency’s safe drinking water standards. Also, the Naples Airport Authority commissioned independent tests of what many residents have observed as “black soot” on four occasions between 2008 and 2023. Each test identified the material as pollen — particularly from palm trees native to the area — turned to mildew in our humid environment, rather than any petroleum-based material associated with aviation.

As aviation continues to progress in new and exciting directions, including the introduction of electric aircraft and sustainable aviation fuel, Naples Airport is committed to being an industry leader in environmentally sustainable and responsible technology and programs. ¦
