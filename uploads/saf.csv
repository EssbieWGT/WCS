North America has the resources, the policy support, and the entrepreneurial drive to lead, but its success will depend on the strength of its partnerships.","Over the past few years, North America has emerged as one of the most dynamic regions in the global sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market. Federal policies like tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, and growing state-level commitments have accelerated SAF development and deployment. Airlines have made historic offtake agreements, while energy majors and technology developers are investing billions into new production pathways.

Despite this momentum, challenges remain. The cost gap with conventional jet fuel continues to be significant, supply volumes are still a fraction of what is needed, and the race is on to secure reliable feedstock. At the same time, new technology pathways - from alcohol-to-jet to power-to-liquids - are moving closer to commercial readiness. The next five years will be critical in determining whether North America can scale SAF production to meet its targets for 2030 and beyond.

In this context, collaboration is no longer optional; it is essential.

Collaboration as the Catalyst for Scale-Up

The SAF value chain is complex, spanning agriculture, refining, technology development, logistics, and aviation operations. Unlike conventional fuels, no single entity can succeed in isolation. Joint ventures, co-investment structures, and long-term offtake agreements are increasingly necessary to distribute risk and align incentives.

While information on technology readiness, policy frameworks, and market developments is readily available, the translation of this knowledge into actionable partnerships depends on trust and shared objectives. These are most effectively established through direct, face-to-face engagement.

Over the past several years, our events have reflected the evolution of this industry. In the early days, attendees came primarily to “get to know the players” - to understand who was entering the market and what they were bringing to the table. Those meetings planted the seeds of partnerships that have since grown into joint ventures, supply agreements, and investment commitments.

Now, as the market matures, the emphasis has shifted. The need is less about introductions and more about strengthening ongoing relationships, advancing commercial agreements, and tackling shared challenges head-on.

That is where face-to-face meetings deliver their greatest value: creating space for candid conversations, alignment of objectives, and the type of collaborative problem-solving that accelerates real-world outcomes.

Creating Spaces for Connection

Our conferences are no longer just networking platforms; they have become catalysts for industry growth. Delegates come not only to exchange insights but also to move projects forward.

This tool is designed to remove the friction of networking. By connecting directly with LinkedIn, it maps your existing network, identifies relevant new contacts, and suggests high-quality connections based on your business priorities and interests. The result: no wasted time, fewer missed opportunities, and more productive conversations with the people who can genuinely advance your objectives.

For delegates, this means walking into the conference with a clear roadmap of who to meet, when to meet them, and why those meetings matter. In an industry as competitive and fast-moving as SAF, this level of efficiency and precision can make the difference between exploring opportunities and closing deals.

Looking Ahead: Building the Future of SAF Together

The reality is that growth in the SAF market depends on the individuals and companies shaping its future. Progress will be driven by those willing to connect, collaborate, and commit to long-term solutions. And that progress happens fastest when the right people are in the same room.

SAF North America Congress is designed to make those meetings possible - bringing together the leaders of aviation, energy, technology, and finance to align strategies, forge partnerships, and move the SAF agenda forward. By enabling high-value face-to-face connections, we aim to ensure that North America not only meets its SAF ambitions but sets a global standard for innovation and collaboration.

Conclusion

Sustainable aviation is no longer an abstract ambition—it is a fast-moving, competitive market that will define the future of global mobility. North America has the resources, the policy support, and the entrepreneurial drive to lead, but its success will depend on the strength of its partnerships.

Today, Alaska Airlines is investing in a sustainable and innovative future for aviation through Alaska Star Ventures, its venture capital arm.
Alaska Star Ventures partners with and invests in startups whose technologies aim to increase operational efficiency and even change the shape of aircraft.
“Rather than being bystanders, we want to make sure Alaska Airlines is part of driving meaningful changes in aviation,” he said.
A few companies in Alaska Star Ventures’ portfolio: Alaska Star Ventures is also creating technology companies through its partnership with UP.Labs.","At Alaska Airlines, elevating the future of travel means getting in on the ground floor of innovation.

Thirty years ago, Alaska Airlines revolutionized the passenger experience when it became the first airline to offer online ticketing. Alaska was also the first airline to use GPS to guide airplanes, and more recently, Alaska’s flight-operations teams were among the first to use artificial intelligence software to chart more efficient flight paths — conserving fuel and saving time for travelers.

Today, Alaska Airlines is investing in a sustainable and innovative future for aviation through Alaska Star Ventures, its venture capital arm. Alaska Star Ventures partners with and invests in startups whose technologies aim to increase operational efficiency and even change the shape of aircraft.

“We have a very rich history in innovation, and it’s truly disruptive innovation,” said Pasha Saleh, who has followed Alaska Airlines’ technology advances since he was a teen working toward his pilot’s license. Now, after a long career as a commercial pilot, Saleh leads Alaska’s corporate development through Alaska Star Ventures. “Rather than being bystanders, we want to make sure Alaska Airlines is part of driving meaningful changes in aviation,” he said.

A few companies in Alaska Star Ventures’ portfolio:

Alaska Star Ventures is also creating technology companies through its partnership with UP.Labs. The first new company, Odysee, launched last fall; its technology will leverage AI to optimize schedule plans to help put aircraft in the right place at the right time, improving reliability across flight operations. A second startup will be announced this year, and a third company is in development.

“All the companies we look at are developing technology that's completely disruptive to what we could figure out on our own,” Saleh said. Alaska Airlines’ in-house teams focus on continually improving the guest experience through innovations such as streamlining the check-in process, while the venture capital partnerships focus on technology advances outside the airline’s core expertise, with time horizons ranging from one year to 10 years.

“Passengers can be sure that because of the investments we're making, their trip is going to be safer, and it's going to be less prone to delays or misconnections,” Saleh said. “It's not on our shoulders to invent the future, but we want to find the smart people doing it, and give them the resources — not just financially, but also to train them on our problems and work with them to develop solutions first for our benefit, and for the airline industry, as well.”

One big challenge Alaska Airlines has taken on is the need to make air travel a more sustainable business. Alaska’s goal is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, and much of the technology Alaska Star Ventures invests in is designed to make progress toward that goal. “Our customers really care — and we really care — about being stewards of the environment and the pristine places in our country that we fly to,” Saleh said.

“Alaska Airlines is going to remain on the forefront of this innovation, like we have been with so many things in the past,” said Saleh, who suggested the name Alaska Star Ventures to honor the company’s history of innovation with a nod to one of its earliest names: Alaska Star Airlines.

“As an airplane geek growing up, I would read about this company (Alaska Airlines) that was associated with some of the great innovations in aviation,” Saleh said. “For me, it is super exciting and humbling to be adding to that journey.”

About XCF Global, Inc. XCF Global, Inc. is a pioneering sustainable aviation fuel company dedicated to accelerating the aviation industry's transition to net-zero emissions.
While XCF Global may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, XCF Global specifically disclaims any obligation to do so.","HOUSTON, TEXAS / ACCESS Newswire / October 1, 2025 / XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF""), and FlyORO Technologies Pte. Ltd. (""FlyORO""), a global leader in digital modular blending solutions for SAF, today announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"").

Under the MOU, XCF and FlyORO will explore the creation of a global partnership to help solve one of aviation's biggest bottlenecks: SAF supply chain and blending inefficiencies. As most blending occurs upstream at production facilities, there are limitations to flexibility and scalability. Midstream and downstream infrastructure such as terminals or airports often lack the equipment and certification processes needed for blending. Together, XCF and FlyORO intend to co-develop an end-to-end solution to enable the ready uplift of SAF. By combining XCF's expertise in SAF production infrastructure with FlyORO's patented modular blending technology - AlphaLite™ - designed for flexible deployment either on-airport or pre-airport, the collaboration aims to support cost-effective, compliant, and scalable SAF integration into the global aviation fuel system.

The urgency to deploy scalable SAF infrastructure has never been greater. By 2030, the global SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion, with worldwide demand expected to surpass 5.5 billion gallons. As this demand accelerates, next-generation blending solutions such as FlyORO's AlphaLite™ system, an innovative, flexible, and low-CAPEX technology, will be critical to bridging production with airports and fleets worldwide.

This potential partnership aligns directly with XCF's international expansion strategy announced in June 2025, under which the company is pursuing a capital-efficient, modular approach to global SAF deployment through regionally tailored partnerships. The potential collaboration with FlyORO would be expected to strengthen XCF's ability to deliver end-to-end SAF solutions, from production through blending and distribution, across the world.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global commented:

""This partnership has the potential to rewire how the aviation industry thinks about SAF deployment. Blending isn't just a technical step, it's a critical piece of the infrastructure puzzle that determines how fast SAF can scale. By combining FlyORO's cutting-edge blending technology with XCF's global strategy, we're creating a pathway to accelerate adoption, reduce costs, and unlock new growth opportunities for investors and stakeholders alike.""

Damian Mc Loughlin, Chief Commercial Officer of FlyORO commented:

""FlyORO was founded with the mission to eliminate barriers to SAF adoption. Our modular AlphaLite™ system makes blending more flexible, scalable, and affordable. Working with XCF, we can expand this vision globally, bringing smarter logistics and faster SAF deployment to airports and airlines around the world.""

The non-binding MOU reflects a shared vision to accelerate SAF adoption and position both companies as leaders in clean aviation infrastructure. Execution is subject to due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

This project, which would constitute an investment of over €100 million, is framed within the company’s strategy to lead the energy transition in Spain and Europe, by driving infrastructure adapted to new energy vectors.

The project is conceived as an energy transition terminal, designed to progressively adapt to market developments, regulation and industrial demand, and will be equipped to operate with both conventional products and sustainable fuels, such as renewable ammonia, captured CO2, green methanol, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and other biofuels.

The plans incorporate the development of a plant designed under strict criteria of safety, energy efficiency, automation, and environmental sustainability. It will be distributed across two separate but connected sites, with a total capacity of approximately 165 000 m3 across 22 tanks (atmospheric, cryogenic, and pressurised) equipped to store hydrocarbons, chemical products, ammonia, and CO2.

The proposal would include an Iberian gauge railway loading bay with a direct connection to the national network, the connection of the terminal to two berths for ships via a network of high-capacity pipes and pumps, and loading islands for tanker trucks, in addition to all auxiliary operating and safety systems.

The planned activities include the storage, blending, and dispatch of a wide range of products, like biodiesel, hydro biodiesel (HVO), bioethanol, methanol, naphtha, SAF, and raw materials for biofuels and traditional hydrocarbons. It also provides for the blending of these products, and multimodal distribution.

In the case of cryogenic CO2 , plans provide for reception and storage in pressurised and refrigerated conditions, and dispatch by land and maritime transport, with the possibility of a future connection by pipeline. With regard to ammonia, reception by the same routes is under study, as is the possibility of temporary reception in cryogenic tanks and subsequent distribution by different forms of transport.

This flexible and integrated multimodal logistics infrastructure will facilitate the optimisation of the regional logistics system, improve operating efficiency, and guarantee a secure and sustainable energy supply for Galicia and the northwest of the Iberian peninsula. Given the complexity of the planned infrastructure, and the types of products to be stored, a scaled implementation is planned, with operations forecast to begin in 2029.

This future terminal would turn the Port of A Coruña into a leading logistics hub at national and European level, due to its strategic location on routes to Northern Europe, America, the south of the continent, and the Middle East.

Jorge Guillén, Aviation & Spain Network Lead, commented: “This initiative reflects Exolum’s firm commitment to the development of new logistics infrastructure in Spain, to tackle the challenges and opportunities of the energy transition. The Outer Port of A Coruña offers exceptional operating conditions, with a privileged location, maritime access, and a multimodal connection that makes it the ideal location of projects like this one. Exolum is confident this installation will contribute to the competitiveness of the industry and the Galician economy, fostering the creation of qualified jobs in the construction and operation phase and attracting industrial investment linked to the decarbonisation of the sector and green molecules.”",https://dlgivnpf6gg8w.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/spain-flag-02.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 08:56:27.577541

“From the skills workforce perspective, there's a huge gap.","From wind power and hydrogen to decarbonised aviation, projects aimed at making that happen were front and centre at IMechE Focus: Sustainability and Decarbonisation (8-12 September), a webinar series sharing cutting edge expertise from industry and academia.

Here are key messages from three of the six sessions.

‘Radical’ solutions needed for aviation emissions

In 2019, air transport was responsible for about 900 megatonnes (million tonnes) of carbon emissions. That represents 2.1% of CO2 emissions from all human sources, said Dr Ken Hart from the University of Hertfordshire, speaking at Aero 2050 – Flying More Sustainably.

That amount could skyrocket due to increased demand, however, despite gradual improvements to fuel efficiency. “We’ve got to do something more radical,” said Dr Hart, who shared analysis of trends up to 2050.

Greener energy sources could include batteries, hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but each have their own drawbacks, from low energy density and feedstock availability to storage challenges.

With supply unlikely to meet demand by 2050, Dr Hart suggested that engineers aim even higher. “You're going to need aircraft configured with a variety of fuels, propulsion systems, and that will depend on the distance they're flying and how many people they carry,” he said.

“Those fuels will consist of battery-electric, hybrid – which is a mixture of hydrogen, perhaps, and battery-electric, or battery-electric and standard gas turbines – and the sustainable aviation fuel.

“So the key challenge is really a development certification of new aircraft fuels and propulsion systems, and the production of these sustainable fuels in quantities needed to meet the future demand.”

It’s time to build the hydrogen workforce

The hydrogen economy of the future could have a huge number of jobs, according to George Jenkins, project leader for the Hydrogen Skills Alliance (HSA) – but they might not fall into simple categories. “When we talk about hydrogen, we're not just talking about one specific sector that needs focusing on. It really is a huge mix,” he said.

Other challenges include uncertainty around the total workforce demand and how the technology will evolve. “We still don't know 100% how current roles are going to be impacted,” Jenkins said. “Additionally, there's a huge amount of competition for the sorts of skillsets that people working in hydrogen might need; competition from other sectors, from oil and gas, from wind.”

One thing is clear, however – a skilled workforce will be needed. Earlier this year, the HSA launched a strategic plan with four main points. “Firstly, we need to understand what the problem is, what the likely demand is, what's already out there. We then need to maximise what's already there.” The next steps are analysing gaps in provision and developing a new curriculum, followed by positioning hydrogen as an aspirational career destination.

The alliance is starting to make that happen with the development of a new framework, which breaks down the roles that might be affected by hydrogen, such as aerospace engineers. The organisation conducted research with industry to understand the roles and the skills they will need in future. That can then be used by industry to understand what should be included in qualifications.

The HSA is also launching the Hydrogen Skills Accelerator programme in the South West and North West of England, which aims to develop open-source training content for the UK hydrogen workforce.

It’s not going to be easy – but there are opportunities to take

Skills gaps, investment uncertainty, policy implementation – industrial decarbonisation is far from easy. A cross-industry panel explored those challenges, and how they might be tackled through effective use of industrial clusters, sector coupling and new technologies.

“Collectively, all the developers, investors and government policymakers need to create a friendly and also high-growth opportunity environment for the workforce, allow them to stay in the energy transition sector and support long-term growth,” said Dr Shengke Zhi from AtkinsRéalis.

“From the skills workforce perspective, there's a huge gap. So that also means an opportunity for all people – if you have transferable skills, if you have aspirations supporting energy transition, we can guarantee there is a big opportunity for you. You can then have a long-term career in the energy transition market.”

LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, October 1, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- • Contrails cause 1-2% of global warming and therefore both organizations are now urging all

commercial airlines to immediately publish their own transparent contrail analysis reports.

• VICTOR and 4AIR are also calling for improvements in flight path planning and Air Traffic Control

protocols, which could reduce the overall impact of contrails

In partnership with 4AIR, Victor, a global leader in on-demand aircraft charter, today announces the

results of its inaugural 2025 Annual Contrails Report, further verifying the impact of contrails on global

warming, as both organisations continue to raise awareness of the CO2 and non-CO2 impact of business

aviation on climate change and urge all commercial airlines to immediately publish their own

transparent contrail analysis reports.

Contrails are long thin lines of cloud, usually seen behind an aircraft and are a product of aircraft engine

emissions interacting with the right combination of temperature and humidity in the upper atmosphere.

Depending on the location and time of day, long-lasting or “big-hit” contrails can have an outsized

warming impact, trapping and absorbing heat that otherwise would radiate back into space. Research

conducted by the European Commission indicates that contrails and non-CO₂ emissions are currently

responsible for about twice as much warming as the CO2 emitted by aviation. Recent estimates from the

University of Cambridge Aviation Impact Accelerator, show that contrails cause about the same amount

of warming each year as all the CO₂ emitted by all flights from 1945 to 2018.

Toby Edwards, co-CEO at Victor stated: “One misconception is that private jets fly above contrail regions,

our report proves this isn’t always the case. We want our private jet clients to have the option to avoid

contrail formation by choosing progressive operators that are proactively making small adjustments to

their flight paths to avoid contrail-forming regions, thereby lowering their environmental

impact. Operators that are working on contrail avoidance using smart flight management software,

which is already readily available, would be transparently recommended to clients. Such an offering

would be a natural extension to our existing product, which includes aircraft estimate fuel-burn data and

Neste sustainable aviation fuel.”

Victor’s transparent Contrails Report, the first of its kind from a private jet charter broker, and set to be

republished annually, analysed 2,987 flights across a mixed fleet worldwide. The findings revealed that

just 1% of contrails accounted for 48% of total warming impact, highlighting how a small number of

high-impact contrails are disproportionately responsible for climate effects, which demonstrates that

meaningful change is achievable by targeting specific flight profiles.

A similar previous study by 4AIR also showed the concentration of a majority of the contrail impact

emerging from a small minority of flights, underscoring the opportunity to cut climate impact

substantially by addressing just a fraction of flights.

Results from the comprehensive analysis by 4AIR, who used the open-source Contrail Cirrus Prediction

model from Contrails.org and hindcast weather data plus ADSB data within a flight, shines the spotlight

on the non-CO2 impact of Victor’s charter flights and highlights the alarming impact of contrails by the

growing commercial airline sector, reinforcing calls to accelerate the deployment of known mitigation

techniques that could quickly reduce these effects.

Kennedy Ricci, President of 4AIR points out this is an industry wide aviation issue, not isolated to

business aviation. “Avoiding atmospheric regions likely to create big hit contrails represents a very large

opportunity to reduce the impact from aviation. But effectively mitigating these regions will require proactive flight planning by operators as well as coordination with Air Traffic Control. As we look at meeting aviation’s climate goals, it is critical to raise awareness of both the impact and opportunity of non-CO2 impacts and encourage operators to understand their contrail footprint”.

Following on from the launch of the new model in spring 2025, the very first customer, Dion Weisler, recently took delivery of his brand-new aircraft and personally flew it home from Switzerland to Australia.

Weisler, former CEO of HP Inc., has relied on the Most Advanced Single for many years: the PC-12 PRO is his fourth PC-12. Having previously owned a PC-12 NG and two PC-12 NGXs, his move to the PC-12 PRO is a clear sign of his long-standing faith in one of the best-performing aircraft in its category.

“To me as a pilot, you rely on two things in particular: there’s the airplane, and then there’s the pilot. And if something happens to the pilot, what are your options? In the PC-12 PRO, you’ve got the new ‘Safety Autoland’ emergency function — which I think is absolutely invaluable. It keeps my family, my friends and anyone else on board safe. If something happens to me, this system automatically takes control to get the aircraft back on the ground at the nearest airport. You can’t put a price on that additional peace of mind,” said Weisler.

Weisler couldn’t pass up the opportunity to fly his PC-12 PRO back to Australia himself, together with one of the Pilatus pilots. The total flight time of 41 hours was split across six days, which saw them leave from Switzerland, and fly via Crete, Egypt, Oman, India, Malaysia, Bali, and Darwin, before arriving “home” in Adelaide, South Australia.

“It was an incredible learning opportunity to fly your own aircraft home over such a vast distance with a factory pilot sitting right seat. In addition to visiting all these amazing countries, it really allowed me to consolidate the crossover training within the new Garmin cockpit environment, and have someone right there to ask any questions about anything that popped up. I am thrilled to own this new intuitive and highly innovative aircraft, and look forward to flying many missions in the future with it.”

“Every decision behind the PC-12 PRO was driven by one question: How do we create more value for our customers? From enhanced cockpit technologies to refined comfort and performance, the PC-12 PRO reflects the voices of those who fly it. It is the result of listening, learning, and delivering – a new aircraft shaped entirely around the people at the heart of Pilatus,” said André Zimmermann, vice-president, Business Aviation.

The PC-12 PRO is the latest version of the world’s best-selling single-engine turboprop in its category.

Equipped with the Garmin G3000 Prime and a completely redesigned cockpit which includes five high-resolution touchscreen displays, it offers state-of-the-art technology and comfort, coupled with a suite of new safety features which includes Safety Autoland. In a nutshell, it is The Most Advanced Single.

In a single-engine aircraft, a proven engine is the most important component. Fortunately, the PC-12 PRO is equipped with the latest version of the most reliable aircraft engine ever produced – the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6.

With over 60,000 engines in use and over 400 million flight hours, the PT6 family of engines has an unrivalled track record. The PT6 engine has already been successfully tested in over 11 million flight hours with the PC-12. Like its predecessor, the PC-12 PRO is also capable of operating with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which enables more sustainable flying at a consistently high level of performance.

In combination with the fully automatic Electronic Propeller and Engine Control System (EPECS), the digital thrust control – or autothrottle system – reduces pilot workload, increases fuel efficiency, ensures a smoother flight experience and protects against engine overload.

The round saw participation from new investors including Orlen VC, Safran Corporate Ventures, International Airlines Group (IAG), and Hostplus, alongside continued support from Clean Energy Ventures, IP Group/Kiko Ventures, Aramco Ventures, Eni Next, Braavos Capital, and the University of Oxford.

The funds will support OXCCU’s commercialization efforts, expand operations, and advance the next phase of its technology scale-up. This follows the 2024 launch of its OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport, with the second demonstration plant, OX2, expected to be fully operational in 2026.

“The successful funding shows that investors are backing technologies with real potential to make a difference,” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. “Our goal is to make SAF more affordable and accessible, helping the aviation sector decarbonize at scale.”

OXCCU’s patented iron-based catalyst simplifies SAF production by converting gaseous waste carbon directly into jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons in a single reaction, eliminating costly intermediate steps. The technology works with a range of input gases, including reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and carbon dioxide with hydrogen, lowering both operating costs and carbon intensity.

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at IAG, highlighted the strategic importance of the investment: “Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 requires new fuels. This investment in OXCCU supports our commitment to meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030 and helps develop next-generation fuels.”

Ireneusz Fafara, President of ORLEN, added: “Supporting OXCCU aligns with our goal of becoming a leading SAF producer in Europe by 2035. Their technology helps us produce renewable fuels and move toward carbon neutrality.”

Nathalie Stubler, Chief Sustainability Officer at Safran, said: “We support scaling promising SAF technologies alongside our own decarbonization efforts in engines and aircraft systems.”

Daniel Goldman of Clean Energy Ventures noted OXCCU’s rapid progress: “In just a few years, OXCCU has gone from lab to commercial demonstration, proving that waste carbon and hydrogen can be converted directly into jet fuel at low cost.”

Dr. Robert Trezona from IP Group added: “This funding is a milestone for the SAF sector and demonstrates the UK’s ability to turn world-class science into solutions that decarbonize aviation while creating jobs.”

OXCCU’s technology also has potential applications beyond aviation, including the production of chemicals and plastics. Symes emphasized the urgency: “The climate challenge is increasing.

The EU has proposed a fuel-exempt approach to pyrolysis oil, and a consultation period on these proposals ended on 19 August.
This continues to encourage tyre-based pyrolysis oil producers to separate out bio-attributed content and polymer content in pyrolysis oil production, with bio-attributed content attracting premiums compared with polymer-derived tyre-based pyrolysis oil.
Nevertheless, despite both regulatory and macroeconomic uncertainty, investment into pyrolysis oil continues, and brand owners still see pyrolysis oil as a key solution for mass-scale food-contact recycled packaging.
There is an additional pyrolysis oil capacity of more than 300,000 tonnes/year under construction or undergoing commissioning.","The second half of 2025 could see renewed investment in chemical recycling after the EU set out its approach to mass-balance accounting in early July. But what effect will these new rules actually have in practice, and is there still room for additional changes? ICIS’ Mark Victory tells us more.

The EU has proposed a fuel-exempt approach to pyrolysis oil, and a consultation period on these proposals ended on 19 August.

The Commission is currently conducting a review before presenting a final draft to its technical, with the aim of adopting the proposals under an implementing decision in Autumn 2025. The extent of any changes to the SUPD proposals resulting from the consultation is currently unclear.

The lack of clarity over the EU’s approach had delayed some investment decisions in 2024 and H1 2025.

Nevertheless, while this goes some way to clarifying one of the key regulatory uncertainties facing the market, there remain areas of legislative doubt that continue to negatively impact demand and investment decisions. These include:

Definitions of waste and recycling under Directive 2008/98/EC - also known as the Waste Framework Directive – which forms the basis of the majority of EU recycling legislation definitions

The End-of-life Vehicles Regulation (ELVR) and whether chemical recycling will be able to count towards proposed targets, and what those proposed targets will be

Whether chemical recycling will be able to count towards Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) targets

This was underscored on 5 August by OMV, whose CEO told ICIS that it needs a more secure regulatory environment before it is willing to risk further investment in scaling up its chemical recycling facilities.

With Europe the first region to detail its approach to mass-balance accounting, there are also concerns over the impact of a fuel-exempt approach on cost-competitiveness with other regions – should they adopt more lenient mass-balance accounting practices such as free-allocation – along with the negative impact on profitability domestically compared with a free-allocation approach.

Legislation surrounding renewable fuels, meanwhile, enjoys greater clarity, and targets under legislation such as the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) III and the Fit for 55 package are encouraging the use of pyrolysis oil as fuel (under the Fit for 55 package fuel derived from plastic waste can count towards targets such as those for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) provided it meets certain criteria such as demonstrating emissions reduction).

This continues to encourage tyre-based pyrolysis oil producers to separate out bio-attributed content and polymer content in pyrolysis oil production, with bio-attributed content attracting premiums compared with polymer-derived tyre-based pyrolysis oil. This is a trend expected to continue in H2 2025 and further in to the mid term.

The wider investment climate remains challenging, particularly given the consolidation of cracker volumes in Europe. Nevertheless, despite both regulatory and macroeconomic uncertainty, investment into pyrolysis oil continues, and brand owners still see pyrolysis oil as a key solution for mass-scale food-contact recycled packaging.

Prices have proved resilient so far in 2025 to the wider macroeconomic malaise afflicting the European chemical sector – particularly for plastic-derived grades - which is at least in part due to structural shortages.

Pyrolysis is expected to be the world’s largest chemical recycling technology by capacity. Europe has a current plastic-derived pyrolysis oil installed input capacity of approximately 150,000 tonnes/year, according to the ICIS Recycling Supply Tracker - Chemical. There is an additional pyrolysis oil capacity of more than 300,000 tonnes/year under construction or undergoing commissioning.

A number of pyrolysis oil plant start-ups have faced delays in 2023-2025 as a result of:

Access to suitable quality waste

Challenges managing the variability of feedstock properties

Delays in environmental permits

Longer than expected commissioning phases for process optimization

Negative macroeconomic conditions creating financing challenges and changing cost structures

This has created a challenge for upstream recycled agglomerate players. Many waste managers have added agglomeration capacity in recent years with a view to serving the burgeoning pyrolysis oil market.

Nevertheless, plant start-up delays has meant the while agglomeration capacity has come onstream, the pyrolysis oil capacity this feedstock was intended to serve has not. This has meant a reduction in investment in agglomeration, and some lines being idled.

There are concerns that this could create challenges for the pyrolysis oil industry as it grows, with access to sufficient high quality waste continuing to be seen as one of the core potential barriers to market scale.

Players continue to expect demand to scale up for pyrolysis oil – particularly plastic-derived grades – in the next 12-24 months, but expect a more rapid increase in supply and demand from 2027-2028 as players gear up to meet voluntary and regulatory recycling targets for 2030.

This new capital will enable OXCCU to accelerate its commercialisation efforts, expand its operations, and advance its next phase of technology scale-up. It builds on the launch of the company’s OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport in 2024. Its second demonstration plant, OX2, is underway and will be fully operational in 2026.

The announcement comes at a time of growing regulatory momentum and market demand for sustainable fuels. However, despite mandates such as the UK SAF mandate and ReFuelEU, high production costs remain a major barrier to widespread adoption.

“In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving,” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. “What we’re seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.”

The funding reflects increasing recognition that driving down SAF production costs is critical to unlocking aviation decarbonisation at scale. OXCCU’s process simplifies SAF production pathways by eliminating the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps. Instead, its patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction. This reduces capital and operating costs, and reduces the carbon intensity of the fuel.

The catalyst’s ability to operate with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen input gas compositions gives it the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks such as reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at International Airlines Group (IAG), said: ""We recognise the need for the world to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably. IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030. Meeting these goals will be supported by this investment into OXCCU which is part of our strategy of developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.”

Ireneusz Fąfara, President of the Management Board of ORLEN, said: “We invest in the technologies of tomorrow to effectively transform our business. This year, we introduced SAF – sustainable aviation fuel produced from renewable and waste raw materials – into our offering.

Immingham site to be flagship SAF Plant

Altalto is based in North Lincolnshire. They aim to transform waste into sustainable, advanced biofuels. They use a mix of commercial and household waste to produce clean biofuels that reduce greenhouse emissions.

The award will enable Altalto to integrate two technologies into its waste-to-SAF process.

The first is NEXTCHEM’s NX Circular gasification: a process which converts waste materials into a synthesis gas. The other is NX CPO, a catalytic process which provides a low-carbon solution to producing synthetic gas.

The integration of new technology will make the Immingham plant the most advanced SAF site in the UK.

Altalto has reported that it will produce 30 million litres of sustainable aviation fuel each year. This achievement will support the UK in achieving its SAF mandate. The mandate requires 10% of jet fuels to have sustainable origins by 2030.

Who are Altalto?

Altalto has developed a plan for the UK’s first commercial waste-to-sustainable fuel plant. The plant, once fully operational will take over 500,000 tonnes of household and commercial waste and convert it into 60 million litres of sustainable fuel each year. This will replace the current disposal process of sending to landfill or incineration.

Altalto combine several technologies in an effort to deliver a more cost-effective supply of sustainable energy. There is a focus on the product being acceptable for use for long-haul air travel due to the reliance on liquid fuels.

The new plant will save 80,000 tonnes of CO2 waste per year, reducing greenhouse gases. It will also bring 100 long term employment opportunities to the local area.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/home-image-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 06:56:57.804791

If strong climate measures are not implemented, emissions will more than double during the long-term planning period. However, with robust measures, much of the increase can be avoided, even as the Armed Forces grow significantly.

Climate change is a serious threat to the Armed Forces and NATO, so the Armed Forces have a vested interest in reducing emissions as much as possible. Moreover, climate measures can contribute to increased combat capability and improved adaption to future combat environments – if done correctly. For example, climate-friendly energy and fuel technologies may enhance the Armed Forces’ energy and supply security. At the same time, it must be assessed whether new vulnerabilities and risks arise. Climate-adapted defensive forces could save operational costs related to fuel and climate taxes, especially in the long term. However, that path may be more expensive in the short and medium term. Therefore, thorough assessments of possible climate measures in the Armed Forces are needed, where climate impact, economics, and operational capability are considered together. A climate budget can support this.

A climate budget is a management tool for cutting emissions. It is reminiscent of a financial budget, but instead of money, it deals with emissions – and how to reach specific climate goals. The Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) has been tasked with developing a climate budget for the defence sector, and this report documents our initial results.

However, creating such a climate budget is not enough. The knowledge FFI has gathered here – and will continue to gather in the coming years – will only contribute to a real green transition if followed up with decisions and actions.

In this report, we have modelled the Armed Forces’ future greenhouse gas emissions. Both direct and indirect emissions could increase significantly if no measures are taken. We have thus examined three initiatives to reduce these emissions: 1) the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), 2) climate assessments in the concept phase, and 3) zero-emission technology on new standard vessels. All three measures can lead to significant emission reductions, and we recommend the sector proceed with them. Nevertheless, these will not be sufficient to meet the sector’s own climate goals. Additional measures will be needed.

We also present a selection of success criteria for implementing a climate budget in the defence sector. These include integrating climate efforts more closely into investment and budgeting processes, creating ownership and anchoring, ensuring sufficient resources and organization, and building competence and communication.

Finally, we point to areas that require further work. The projections can be improved. There is a need to develop tools that make it easier to use the climate budget in practice. FFI is planning a study on how SAF can strengthen supply preparedness, and we aim to delve deeper into climate-economic issues that may be relevant for the defence sector.",https://www.ffi.no/en/publications-archive/er-det-mulig-a-ruste-opp-forsvaret-pa-en-klimavennlig-mate-forsvarssektorens-klimabudsjett-2025/_/image/81842178-6336-4e3b-8aa5-9d84a92041ca:4dc6adec38f0d7aed0fc61b0513eefb79a74b502/block-1200-630/FFI_SEO-bilde_m%C3%B8rk.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 06:57:07.976682

Series B investors include IAGiVentures (the dedicated corporate venturing arm of the International Airlines Group), Safran Corporate Ventures, and Orlen VC alongside re-investment from world-class Series A participants.

‍OXCCU, the Oxford University spin-out developing a one-step process to convert waste carbon into SAF, has raised £20.75 MM ($28 MM) in an oversubscribed Series B funding round. The round includes new investors Orlen VC, Safran Corporate Ventures, International Airlines Group (IAG), Hostplus, and TCVC, alongside continued support from existing backers Clean Energy Ventures, IP Group/Kiko Ventures, Aramco Ventures, Eni Next, Braavos Capital, and the University of Oxford.

This new capital will enable OXCCU to accelerate its commercialization efforts, expand its operations, and advance its next phase of technology scale-up. It builds on the launch of the company’s OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport in 2024. The second demonstration plant, OX2, is underway and will be fully operational in 2026.

The announcement comes at a time of growing regulatory momentum and market demand for sustainable fuels. However, despite mandates such as the UK SAF mandate and ReFuelEU, high production costs remain a major barrier to widespread adoption.

“In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving,” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. “What we’re seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.”

The funding reflects increasing recognition that driving down SAF production costs is critical to unlocking aviation decarbonization at scale. OXCCU’s process simplifies SAF production pathways by eliminating the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps. Instead, its patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction. This reduces capital and operating costs, and reduces the carbon intensity of the fuel.

The catalyst’s ability to operate with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen input gas compositions gives it the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks such as reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at International Airlines Group (IAG), said: ""We recognize the need for the world to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably. IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030. Meeting these goals will be supported by this investment into OXCCU which is part of our strategy of developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.”

Ireneusz Fąfara, President of the Management Board of ORLEN, said: “We invest in the technologies of tomorrow to effectively transform our business. This year, we introduced SAF—sustainable aviation fuel produced from renewable and waste raw materials—into our offering. In line with our strategy, by 2035 we aim to become one of the leading producers of SAF in Europe. Supporting the achievement of this goal is a new investment by ORLEN VC in the technology of OXCCU, a company enabling the conversion of green hydrogen and carbon dioxide into synthetic aviation fuel. Its commercialization will strengthen our market competitiveness and support our pursuit of carbon neutrality.”

Nathalie Stubler, Safran Chief Sustainability Officer comments: “At Safran, we are committed to advancing the decarbonization of aviation. In addition to the development of new technologies in our own products such as engines and aircraft equipment, we are also supporting the de-risking and industrial scale-up of the most promising sustainable aviation fuel technologies.”

Daniel Goldman, Managing Partner and Co-founder of Clean Energy Ventures, said: ""OXCCU stands out not only for its differentiated technology but also for the speed of its progress toward commercial plants. In just a few years, the company has advanced from the lab to a commercial demonstration facility, proving that waste carbon and hydrogen can be converted directly into jet fuel at low cost. That rapid progress is reshaping the sustainable aviation fuel market, unlocking the affordability aviation needs to decarbonize. With the extraordinary leadership team and support of its strategic investors, we are confident OXCCU will lead the decarbonization of fuels and chemicals in the coming years.""

Dr Robert Trezona, Partner, Cleantech at IP Group, said: “This round is a significant milestone, not just for the company, but for the sector – significant capital being put to work from established industry actors on a credible path to fully decarbonize aviation. OXCCU showcases the UK’s ability to lead in climate innovation, turning world-class science into global solutions, while generating jobs and lasting impact. We’re proud to continue to support the company as it scales its compelling single-step technology.”

OXCCU’s solution meets both environmental and commercial demands, with applications that extend beyond aviation into chemicals and plastics.

This is a critical time for climate tech, as the urgency continues to increase” added Symes. “Aviation needs a solution, and the serious lever is SAF. The challenge is SAF cost and that is exactly what we are addressing at OXCCU.”

The Department for Transport (DfT) has provided £1.5m for a feasibility study looking at whether sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from elements of carbon dioxide and water could be manufactured at the Yeadon-based airport.

SAFs are man-made alternatives to fossil fuels and are typically created from plant oils or household waste.

The eight-month study will look at whether the the energy, known as Electrolysis Sustainable Aviation Fuel (eSAF), could be made and then used at LBA to power aircraft.

The study is being delivered by the University of Sheffield in partnership with the airport and with support from academics at the University of Leeds.

While SAFs still release carbon when burned by aircraft, as the fuel is recycled it will not be adding to the overall load of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

LBA Chief Executive Vincent Hodder said: ""I know this sounds like science fiction, but it is just science.

""The only ingredients that go into eSAF are electricity, water and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

""All of that is available locally and then all we have to do is transport the liquid to the aircraft and you've got a completely circular carbon movement.""

Leeds North West MP Katie White, who campaigned for the study, said: ""This funding is a crucial step towards making sustainable jet fuel a reality at Leeds Bradford.

""It's about cutting emissions in one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise, and creating the skilled jobs and investment that come with it.

""I'm proud to see our region leading the way.""

If the study is deemed a success, a production facility powered by green electricity could be built at the airport to extract carbon elements from the air alongside hydrogen elements from water. These would then be recombined to create the eSAF.

Transport and Environment, a campaign group which lobbies for clean energy and fuel, has welcomed the news but warned there was a ""mountain to climb"" to ""create enough SAF to satisfy the UK aviation industry"".

Roger Tyers, the group's UK aviation policy manager, said: ""We think this is the future for aviation but these kind of fuels are still in their infancy.

""The tech is proven but we don't have any being developed on a large commercial scale yet.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/93b4/live/48ec56c0-995a-11f0-af33-e32b3939e8ca.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 06:57:15.322675

Sheldon Hee, IATA Regional Vice President for Asia Pacific, emphasised that aviation contributes approximately US$14.4 billion (RM68.1 billion) annually and supports over 650,000 jobs, including 100,000 direct aviation roles.

Hee stressed the importance of policies that avoid negative impacts on airlines and passengers, particularly concerning taxes, levies, and security-related fees beyond border controls.

Malaysia’s position as an international travel hub relies on maintaining efficiency and competitiveness, while higher operating costs could harm airlines, travellers, and Malaysia’s global connectivity.

A positive development noted by Hee is the recent introduction of the first locally blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). IATA is in discussions with the government about establishing a robust SAF policy by 2027 to align with global carbon reduction efforts in aviation.

As part of its engagement with policymakers, IATA has submitted six proposals for Budget 2026. These include calls for stable and predictable policies to support renewable energy and fuel production, transparency in SAF pricing, and mechanisms to ensure airlines can reliably claim environmental benefits from using SAF.

The association also urged the government to avoid introducing a SAF mandate as a stand-alone measure without incentives to help bridge the price gap with conventional fuel. In addition, it recommended recognising global SAF accounting and reporting standards to support market access and participation in international SAF trade.

Looking ahead, Hee said Malaysia stands to benefit from the Asia Pacific region’s projected rapid aviation growth over the next 20 years, provided that the right policies are in place.

He highlighted digitalisation as a key area for improvement, with IATA’s ONE ID system for passengers and ONE Record for cargo offering opportunities to improve efficiency and productivity.

ONE ID aims to streamline travel through identity management and biometric recognition, while ONE Record provides a unified view of shipments through shared data and digital logistics.

Hee underscored the need for training incentives to develop the skilled workforce required for future industry demands. Aviation not only generates direct employment but also supports wider economic activities such as tourism, trade, and investment. He pointed out that each flight connecting Malaysia to the world contributes to the country’s economic opportunities.

Concluding, Hee reaffirmed IATA’s readiness to collaborate with the government to ensure Budget 2026 policies fully unlock Malaysia’s international aviation potential. The budget is scheduled to be presented by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim in Parliament on October 10.

A UK-based climate technology firm has secured $28 million in Series B funding to commercialize a novel process for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The core development is a patented iron-based catalyst that converts waste carbon dioxide (CO2) and green hydrogen directly into jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons in a single exothermic reaction. This breakthrough simplifies the complex e-fuel production supply chain by eliminating costly intermediate steps, immediately lowering the capital and operating expenditure required to scale production. The successful funding round validates a critical pathway for the aviation sector, which is currently struggling to meet decarbonization targets, with the resulting fuel offering up to an 85% reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

Context

The informed professional has consistently wondered → What is the true cost of e-fuels, and can they be produced at a scale that matters? Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is seen as the only viable near-term solution for aviation decarbonization, yet high production costs and feedstock scarcity have kept its adoption rate low, accounting for only 0.7% of total airline fuel consumption. The industry consensus has been that without a major technological or policy intervention to drive down the cost of synthesis, mandated targets would remain out of reach.

Analysis

This development is driven by a technological breakthrough in catalysis. Traditional e-fuel production pathways require multiple energy-intensive chemical steps, such as the reverse water gas shift or the creation of e-methanol as an intermediate product. The new patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet fuel from the two core building blocks → waste CO2 and green hydrogen → in one reactor. Think of this catalyst as a shortcut that bypasses two expensive toll booths on the fuel production highway.

This simplification reduces the required equipment footprint and energy input, which is the primary cause of the high cost of e-fuels. Manufacturers are expected to react by accelerating partnerships and offtake agreements with companies that can demonstrate a clear, cost-competitive path to meeting the growing regulatory and corporate demand for SAF.

Outlook

This development implies that the cost curve for e-fuels will bend downward faster than previously modeled, making SAF a more competitive commodity. The next simple thing to watch for is the operational status of the company’s second demonstration plant, OX2, which is expected to be fully operational in 2026. A successful demonstration at this larger scale will signal that the technology is moving from lab-validated to commercially de-risked, which will trigger a wave of new, large-scale offtake agreements and final investment decisions for full commercial plants.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Allium-Inflorescence-Morphology-Supporting-Pollinator-Biodiversity-Sustainable-Agroecosystem-Functionality.jpeg,N,,2025-10-01 02:56:13.462066

The ...,Sayan Chakravarty,,,,,https://luxurylaunches.com/travel/phantom-3500-private-jet-gets-massive-order-09302025.php,"A business jet with no traditional windows, its fuselage wrapped in smooth composite skin, cameras feeding live footage to six-foot-wide displays lining the cabin walls.
According to the WSJ, Otto claims the Phantom 3500 will burn 60% less fuel than comparable midsize jets.
Flexjet’s massive order, one of the largest firm commitments in business aviation history, signals this isn’t just vaporware.
The Ohio-based fractional ownership giant, fresh off an $800 million capital raise led by L Catterton, is positioning the Phantom 3500 as a core platform for its fleet.
The company is also pushing a climate narrative, designing the aircraft to fly at altitudes where contrails are less likely and using Williams engines compatible with 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel.","The private aviation world has a new disruptor, and it doesn’t have windows. Texas-based Otto Aerospace’s Phantom 3500, backed by a substantial 300-aircraft order from Flexjet, is betting that passengers will trade their porthole views for panoramic digital screens and fuel savings that could make flying private more affordable than business class.

At first glance, the idea sounds like science fiction. A business jet with no traditional windows, its fuselage wrapped in smooth composite skin, cameras feeding live footage to six-foot-wide displays lining the cabin walls. CEO Paul Touw calls the experience “surreal,” promising passengers can “look at the entire world around you,” including the curvature of Earth at cruise altitude.

The company has branded this setup “SuperNatural Vision,” and while it might take some convincing for travelers used to pressing their noses against Gulfstream glass, there’s serious engineering behind the spectacle.

The real story is efficiency. According to the WSJ, Otto claims the Phantom 3500 will burn 60% less fuel than comparable midsize jets. That’s not a modest improvement, it’s a generational leap. The secret lies in laminar flow aerodynamics. Without window cutouts interrupting the fuselage, air slides smoothly over the carbon-fiber skin. Add smaller engines made possible by reduced fuel needs, and Otto argues it can deliver 3,200 to 3,500 nautical miles of range, 590 mph cruise speeds, and access to short runways, all at a target list price of $19.5 million. That undercuts super-midsize incumbents and threatens high-end light jets on total ownership costs.

Flexjet’s massive order, one of the largest firm commitments in business aviation history, signals this isn’t just vaporware. The Ohio-based fractional ownership giant, fresh off an $800 million capital raise led by L Catterton, is positioning the Phantom 3500 as a core platform for its fleet. Chairman Kenn Ricci frames the bet as “introducing tomorrow’s standards,” and with 300 aircraft on order, Flexjet is clearly banking that tomorrow arrives soon.

The timeline is aggressive but not fantasy. Otto has unveiled a full-scale mockup, first flight is targeted for 2027, and deliveries should begin around 2030. Manufacturing will happen at a one-million-square-foot smart factory at Jacksonville’s Cecil Airport, backed by $515 million in state incentives. The supply chain reads like a who’s who of aerospace: Leonardo for composites, Williams International for engines, Garmin for avionics, Mecaer for landing gear. Leadership includes former Boeing Chairman Dennis Muilenburg and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the board, lending heavyweight credibility to what could otherwise appear to be startup moonshot territory.

Regulations won’t block the concept either. FAA Part 25 certification doesn’t mandate passenger windows, though emergency exits need viewing capability. Otto will install small traditional windows at exits and build redundancy into the camera system. The company is also pushing a climate narrative, designing the aircraft to fly at altitudes where contrails are less likely and using Williams engines compatible with 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel. Otto claims a 90% carbon dioxide reduction with SAF and up to 97% total warming impact reduction when contrail avoidance is factored in.",https://luxurylaunches.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/otto-aerospaces-phantom-3500.jpeg,N,,2025-09-30 16:57:02.923322

Masdar plans to apply the UAE's experience in producing sustainable aviation fuel to Azerbaijan, Murad Sadigov, head of the Masdar representative office in Azerbaijan, said at the Baku Climate Action Week (BCAW2025), Trend reports.

The evolution of sustainable energy modalities in Azerbaijan transcends mere export initiatives, concurrently striving to enhance the robustness and dependability of the national energy infrastructure.

In his perspective, the primary objective transcends merely addressing inefficiencies within the energy infrastructure; it also encompasses the development of a robust and dependable framework. ""The volatility of energy resources renders them devoid of intrinsic value; conversely, the reliability of energy systems is paramount,"" he asserted.

Consequently, the energy strategy was formulated to facilitate stakeholder engagement with the grid infrastructure while concurrently upholding a robust and reliable energy provision.

Sadigov highlighted the criticality of deploying energy storage architectures, optimizing balancing mechanisms, and integrating diverse renewable energy portfolios, while underscoring the significance of continuous investigation into offshore wind energy technologies and green hydrogen innovations.

He pointed out that Masdar is actively investing in green hydrogen production and is already implementing a pilot project to produce sustainable aviation fuel in the UAE, a project the company plans to apply in Azerbaijan.

Masdar has also launched the largest '24-hour generation' project-a combination of solar power (5.5 GW) and storage systems (19 GWh)-under construction in the UAE.

The company intends to implement similar solutions in Azerbaijan on a smaller scale.

""Such technological challenges make it possible to bring renewable energy as close as possible to commercial generation. This is made possible by the support of the Azerbaijani government and the availability of qualified personnel, as the country has always been a leading energy hub and is currently transferring innovations to the renewable energy sector,"" Sadigov explained.

He also noted that the Azerbaijani government is investing in grid modernization and recently announced the construction of two large storage systems to control frequency and energy flows, which will increase grid resilience and reliability.

As Sadigov puts it, Azerbaijan's sights are set on the horizon, reaching for the stars and aiming to do much more than just send green energy across to Europe.

""We have also witnessed the signing of agreements with Central Asia. This is a step toward the formation of a large-scale energy network that will ensure stability throughout the region. Azerbaijan is becoming the heart of an energy hub that will play a key role in the energy transition not only for the Caucasus but for all of Eurasia,"" he added.",https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2025-09/30/TNA_6a8dbimage_story.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 16:57:17.303481

Investment in OXCCU is a part of IAG’s commitment to invest up to €200 million over five years through its corporate venturing arm, IAGi Ventures.

London, 29 September 2025 - International Airlines Group (IAG) has participated in the £20.75 million ($28 million) Series B funding round for OXCCU, a UK-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) innovator. IAG has been joined by new and existing investors including Safran Corporate Ventures, Orlen and Aramco Ventures, among others.

IAG invested in OXCCU through IAGi Ventures, its dedicated corporate venturing arm, which earlier this year announced an investment commitment of up to €200 million over five years – the largest by a European airline group. OXCCU exemplifies the type of high-potential company IAG is seeking to support through IAGi Ventures.

Spun out of Oxford University, OXCCU has developed a novel, patented process which directly converts gaseous waste carbon and hydrogen into jet fuel range hydrocarbons. This process eliminates a key step required in conventional methods with the potential to reduce both capital and operating costs. It can operate with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen input gas compositions giving it the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks into SAF.

The Series B fundraise will enable OXCCU to deliver on its scale-up strategy and accelerate the commercialisation of its technology. It follows the opening of their first demonstration plant1 at London Oxford Airport last year, and will support the development of a larger-scale facility expected to be operational in 2026. OXCCU’s facilities could play a crucial role in helping meet the UK’s SAF mandate and IAG’s decarbonisation goals.

“We’re focused on backing companies whose technologies have the potential to deliver meaningful impact and we’re excited to be supporting OXCCU as it embarks on the next stage of its scale-up journey,” said Ignacio Tovar, IAG Director of Innovation. “By leveraging our industry expertise, acting as early adopters, and fostering collaboration across our airlines and broader partner ecosystem, we help the companies we back to scale faster.”

IAG was the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050 and has a goal of meeting 10% of fuel needs with SAF by 2030. In 2024, 1.9% of IAG’s total fuel used was SAF, saving 469,000 tonnes of CO2, up almost 200% versus 2023.

In twenty years, future generations may ask why European NATO members failed to use this period of astronomical defence spending to advance broader goals — including the energy transition. After all, there is a precedent.

On the eve of World War I, Winston Churchill led the British Navy away from burning coal to burning oil. The move, considered bold by many, ultimately benefited the British fleet by making its ships faster, quieter and safer, ushering in a new era of oil.

Historically, defence innovation has been beneficial for advancements in other sectors, too. GPS and the microwave, two technologies now acknowledged as indispensable, were initially developed for military purposes, before later being adopted for commercial use.

Semiconductors, biotech and cybersecurity are other examples of transformative innovations that originated in the defence sector but have since contributed to societal development.

Defence spending as a missed opportunity

The 5% spending target, agreed by NATO member states this summer in The Hague, therefore risks becoming a missed opportunity to address non-military, yet equally critical, issues. This isn’t about using electric tanks or solar-powered missiles by tomorrow; it is about shoring up the continent’s long-term energy resilience through clean innovation.

The security imperative is clear. Supply chains for fossil fuels have already proven to be an operational vulnerability for militaries. Sustaining fuel supplies and their storage was one of Russia’s weaknesses in 2022.

For NATO troops, the logistics of securing and protecting diesel supplies during combat proved a challenge in Afghanistan and Iraq, with many lives being lost.

On top of that, Europe’s domestic liquid fuel refining capacity has been steadily declining. Relying on even more fuel imports to meet militaries’ growing demand in the coming years poses significant security risks, as highlighted by Europe’s most recent energy crisis.

How the defence sector can reshape Europe's energy future

Any decision to invest in fossil-based infrastructure and fuel sources is thus strategically short-sighted. So how then could European NATO members optimise their spending? So-called dual-use technologies are a good place to start.

Research into sustainable fuels, for instance, shows that they could be cheaper, safer, quieter and less visible on foreign radars. The Netherlands, a frontrunner in the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) capacity, just published its National SAF Roadmap to scale the production of SAF’s by 2035. Increasing demand by the Royal Netherlands Air Force, who already operated F-16 jets on SAF as early as 2019, could significantly boost this ramp-up in the decade ahead.

Elsewhere, the development of ultra-lightweight materials could help to reduce tank weight – a growing challenge for modern military logistics – which would be a boost for energy efficiency. At the same time, these materials might be adapted for commercial heavy-duty vehicles and aviation to facilitate the use of biofuels and electrification.

Another example might be the development of an integrated smart grid and battery storage system to help remote military bases withstand significant energy vulnerabilities. In civilian spaces, these kinds of micro-systems could also be deployed in natural disaster zones during power outages. It’s a clear ‘win-win’, given the environmental challenges that are already straining armed forces and public communities alike.

This will not be straightforward, but there is a path to take. To begin with, European policy makers must focus on reducing our fossil fuel dependency and carbon footprint. By directing resources, including some of NATO’s 5% pledge, toward clean innovation, militaries can herald a more strategic approach which strengthens Europe’s collective deterrence and its energy security.

An EU toolbox for clean defence

Attempts to build bridges between energy, climate and defence stakeholders will be key. Fortunately, work is already well underway: The continuation of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS), an EU-funded initiative run by the European Defence Agency (EDA) until 2028 is one such example and something which can be built on.

Attracting investments in clean innovation is another important step in putting the European Defence Industrial Strategy (EDIS) and its key piece of regulation, the European Defence Industry Programme (EDIP), into practice.

To support this, defence procurement criteria could include a life-cycle assessment of the costs of new defence systems with a premium on the costs of imported fossil fuels. This would likely lower the costs of military equipment that could be powered by more sustainable fuels in the long run. The planned amendment of the regulation on defence and sensitive security procurement, as recently proposed by the European Commission, could include such rules.

The EU could further consider a percentage for clean innovation in defence, scaling already existing programmes, such as those of the EDA. Research and development through the European Defence Fund might also be connected to Horizon Europe, which has a long tradition of funding innovation in clean technologies.

In addition, akin to industrial alliances such as the European Battery Alliance and the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, a new public-private coalition could be set up to strengthen industry collaboration around dual-use innovation.

Future-proofing Europe’s defence

Lowering the military’s reliance on oil and gas will not be simple, and concerns about new insecurities linked to the raw materials needed for clean technologies are valid. Yet these challenges cannot justify short-sighted choices. Europe must avoid reactive decisions today that would lock its militaries into new fossil fuel dependencies tomorrow. The EU should invest not only in stronger defence capabilities but also in more sustainable, future-proof ones. History shows it’s a smart idea.",https://www.clingendael.org/sites/default/files/styles/c_header_image/public/2025-09/Rutte%20Nato.jpg?itok=65mjTH6a,N,,2025-09-30 11:56:21.649219

“The importance of space assets is expanding,” says Maruoka Shingo, advisor to the director of the Space Strategy Fund.
Ambitious Agenda Despite heavy investment, the Japanese aerospace industry faces sizable obstacles.","After decades of economic stagnation, Japan is betting big on growth in the aerospace industry, particularly the new space sector.

At the center of that gambit is the Japanese government’s ¥1 trillion ($6.8 billion) Space Strategy Fund, a decadelong effort that kicked off in 2024 that the country hopes will transform its industry.

JAXA works to become more entrepreneurial, innovative and strategic

The country proceeds on hydrogen as others retreat

Tokyo wants to double the size of the Japanese domestic space market, to ¥8 trillion (about $54 billion) from ¥4 trillion in 2020 by the early 2030s. By then, Japan wants to launch some 30 rockets into space each year and have more than 30 new satellite services on offering—everything from communications constellations to robotic spacecraft.

Japan’s Space Strategy Fund is the country’s largest dedicated technology development program for aerospace. Although spending from the fund will fluctuate annually, the average amounts to ¥100 billion per year—about 65% of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) budget in 2025.

Yet the Space Strategy Fund is by no means the country’s only initiative. The Japanese government and industry are retooling across aerospace in anticipation that next-generation technologies could allow the country to seize a greater share of the market.

As Airbus and Boeing put off investments into a next-generation airliner, the Japanese government has launched a hydrogen-powered effort to grab a larger share of that market. The country’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) is making considerable investments in advanced composite structures that could be used for a blended wing body, as well as fuel cells and hydrogen-burning turbines. Japan also is working to develop cheaper sustainable aviation fuel and create a hydrogen supply chain.

In the automotive field, several of Japan’s large automakers are expanding their involvement in aerospace, aiming to evolve into mobility companies. For example, Toyota is lending its manufacturing expertise and making grants to U.S.-based Joby Aviation, an electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing (eVTOL) aircraft developer. Honda is developing its own hybrid eVTOL, too.

Part of the thinking is that Japanese excellence in automotive manufacturing—the sort that perfected lean manufacturing and produces millions of cars annually—can boost the country’s prospects in the nascent space and eVTOL sectors.

Honda surprised the space industry in June when it launched a small reusable rocket to an altitude of nearly 900 m (2,950 ft.) and landed it successfully back on the ground. The rocket was developed in secret, after a brief press announcement about the effort in 2021. Guidance and control systems for the rocket came from Honda’s autonomous driving development project.

Whereas other countries’ automakers see battery-electric powertrains as the future of cars, Japan has not given up on hydrogen fuel cells. In partnership with JAXA, Toyota is developing a large, inhabitable, regenerative, fuel-cell-powered lunar rover, the Lunar Cruiser. And in April, American Honda Motor Co. announced plans to test an electrolysis system onboard the International Space Station, part of its own potential lunar regenerative fuel cell system.

Japan’s longstanding interest in developing hydrogen-powered vehicles is often linked by industry observers to the country’s lack of hydrocarbon fuels. There is also concern that manufacturing cars with electric batteries, which have fewer components, would mean less work for automotive workers and suppliers—a serious concern in Japan, where social cohesion is paramount.

Doubling Down

The Space Strategy Fund is a sort of doubling down by the Japanese government on the new space sector. The Japanese government launched a ¥100 billion, five-year support package in 2018 for new space startups. Seven years later, the country boasts more than 100 space startups.

JAXA has a separate budget, but the agency runs the Space Strategy Fund on behalf of three core Japanese ministries, including the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (known as METI). Despite its name, the fund is not an investment vehicle for taking equity stakes; it makes grants to companies.

The multiple government ministries behind the fund are also indicative of broad consensus within the Japanese government that the space industry cannot be ignored.

“The importance of space assets is expanding,” says Maruoka Shingo, advisor to the director of the Space Strategy Fund. “People’s [day-to-day] living is supported by space assets.”

Tokyo also sees launch capacity, satellite communications and navigation as national assets, he adds.

“The underlying objective is about building a Japanese domestic space market, creating the opportunity that certain payloads can be bought domestically and not have to be imported,” says Rainer Horn, partner and managing director of consultancy Novaspace.

JAXA selected Phase 1 projects for grants from the Space Strategy Fund in November, some 52 projects spread across 22 technology themes.

“These themes are decided by the government cabinet office,” says Ina Koji, manager of the strategic planning division within the Space Strategy Fund Department of JAXA. “They are the command and control.”

JAXA advises and selects companies based on those policy goals, Koji tells Aviation Week.

In Phase 1, three themes stand out for receiving considerable investment: commercial satellite constellations, high-resolution and high-frequency optical observation satellite systems and regenerative fuel-cell systems.

Submissions for Phase 2 were due in September, and rocket components, orbital transfer vehicles and satellite-based optical data relays were earmarked for the biggest grants.

The Space Strategy Fund is also part of a larger push by the Japanese government to evolve JAXA beyond its traditional research role. In recent years, JAXA has launched a series of parallel funds, incubators, tech transfer, co-development and small business research and development initiatives designed to help startups at each stage of their development.

Horn sees an effort to change the culture of JAXA.

“They want JAXA engineers to think beyond JAXA, to see where they can be useful in either joint projects or to learn from the interaction [with startups]—to get a bit more of a commercial spirit,” he says.

Ambitious Agenda

Despite heavy investment, the Japanese aerospace industry faces sizable obstacles. Japan is a relatively small market compared with China, the European Union or the U.S. And in some areas, domestic Japanese companies are playing catch-up to rivals that have a big lead, such as SpaceX, which dominates the launch vehicle service and broadband internet satellite constellation markets.

This latest push is by no means guaranteed to succeed. The glaring cautionary tale is Japan’s last ¥1 trillion aerospace development project: the SpaceJet program.

SpaceJet, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries’ ambitious effort to develop a regional airliner, was shut down in 2023 after a 15-year effort. The program was fighting an uphill battle from the beginning, looking to enter a lucrative U.S. market where it would have had to elbow out incumbents, such as Embraer. Expensive mistakes helped sink the effort, as the airliner’s original design was too big to meet U.S. scope-clause requirements and added to redevelopment costs.

At least initially this time, Japanese government ministries and companies are mostly avoiding head-to-head competition with international rivals in foreign markets. They are opting to carve out local niches, take a complementary role in another country’s program or grab a share of not-yet-cemented markets, such as space or advanced air mobility.

For example, Interstellar Technologies aims to serve the small satellite launch market for the Japanese government, as well as commercial satellite operators in Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. NEDO’s Next-Generation Aircraft program does not necessarily aim to take the lead on developing a future airliner, but the effort intends to position Japanese industry to take a bigger slice of critical composite structures work and engine manufacturing.

For small-satellite developer ArkEdge Space, a Japan-focused strategy means serving the country’s needs as a maritime nation by developing satellites with payloads such as next-generation maritime communication systems and hyperspectral sensors for maritime observation.

“Japan is just one single country. It is difficult to develop the space utilization industry, so we have to work with Pacific Ocean countries and also some [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries,” ArkEdge CEO Takayoshi Fukuyo tells Aviation Week. “We have to think strategically about which areas we can develop.”

For its part, SkyDrive has partnered with Suzuki Motor Corp. to develop an eVTOL that is considerably smaller than the aircraft of U.S. rivals Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation. Both American companies are developing aircraft to carry four passengers on fixed shuttle runs from city centers to airports, but SkyDrive’s SD-05 eVTOL carries two passengers and one pilot. That smaller, lightweight configuration is intended to enable a conventional taxi business carrying passengers on hops between unreinforced landing pads on high-rise buildings and railway stations. Japan’s urban rail networks are tightly integrated, with door-to-door travel times that often rival or beat car journeys. SkyDrive, of Toyota City, Japan, has formed strategic partnerships with prominent Japanese rail operators.

Many new aerospace technologies have dual uses and are also boosted by government spending, especially Japan’s Defense Ministry, whose budget has grown 67% over the past four years to ¥8.7 trillion in fiscal 2025. The space-related items in this year’s fiscal budget amounted to ¥79 billion

Space Compass, a joint venture between terrestrial telecommunications company NTT and satellite communications company SKY Perfect JSAT, is developing a geostationary-Earth-orbit laser communications relay satellite network. It received a defense ministry contract in April to demonstrate relaying space domain awareness data from geostationary Earth orbit.

As other countries are developing rival offerings and chasing SpaceX’s Starlink low-Earth-orbit broadband constellation, Japan is working on alternative technologies. Space Compass is partnered with Airbus subsidiary AALTO, operator of the solar-powered Zephyr High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS), to supply broadband from the stratosphere. The partners are targeting a launch of commercial service for a HAPS-based cellular network in 2026. Phase 2 of the project includes integrating a satellite backhaul system for areas where terrestrial gateways cannot be installed.

Telecommunications company SoftBank also plans to launch a HAPS smartphone network in Japan in 2026 with a “pre-commercial” service that is slated to be supported by a stratospheric airship built by Sceye of New Mexico, SoftBank said in June. The company also has a partnership to use AeroVironment’s fixed-wing, solar-powered HAPS Sunglider aircraft.

This 21st-century aerospace push by the Japanese government in some ways follows the industrial policy of “Japan Inc.,” a 20th-century coordinated development effort among the country’s ministries, banks and corporations that led to a post-World War II economic boom known as “The Japanese Economic Miracle.” That model produced world leaders in the automotive, electronic, machine tool, shipbuilding and heavy industries, among other sectors.

While Tokyo was attempting to catch up and leapfrog foreign rivals in its original “Japan Inc.” industrial policy—a much lower-risk strategy because the technological trail had been blazed by others—its latest push is into the great unknown of emerging technologies, some of which are destined to fail.

Yet wide-ranging investments into new aerospace technologies sets recent Japanese government policy apart, not just from the past, but from other governments. For example, European governments are not betting so boldly, says Horn, Novaspace’s managing director. “The Japanese are very courageous,” he adds.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-09-30 12:57:30.851233

A new single-step catalytic process is poised to unlock commercially viable Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by converting waste carbon and hydrogen directly into jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons. This innovation, developed by an Oxford University spin-out, replaces the complex, multi-step chemical processes currently used by competitors, which are the primary reason SAF remains prohibitively expensive. The simplified reaction eliminates costly intermediate steps, directly addressing the high production cost that has stalled widespread adoption. The technology’s potential for scale and cost reduction was validated by a recent £20.75 million Series B funding round, attracting major strategic investors from the aviation and energy sectors.

Context

The informed professional has long wondered if the aviation industry could ever truly decarbonize without massive government subsidies or crippling ticket price increases. The core challenge has always been the “SAF cost premium” → sustainable fuels are chemically and functionally ready, but their complex production pathways → often involving multiple high-energy conversion steps → make them three to five times more expensive than traditional kerosene. The industry needed a fundamental engineering breakthrough to simplify the process and bring the cost down to a commercially competitive level.

Analysis

This innovation is a direct response to the market’s need for radical cost compression in SAF production. The scientific discovery is a patented iron-based catalyst that acts as a multi-functional agent. In simple terms, traditional SAF production is like a complex assembly line with three separate machines → one to clean the input, one to convert it into an intermediate chemical, and a third to turn that chemical into jet fuel. This new catalyst combines all three functions into a single, efficient reactor.

Think of this new process like an all-in-one kitchen appliance that takes raw ingredients (waste carbon) and produces the final meal (jet fuel) in one go, drastically cutting down on equipment, energy, and time. This core dynamic shifts the economic model of SAF from a niche, high-cost product to a potential commodity.

Outlook

The critical factor to watch is the performance and cost data from the OX2 demonstration plant, expected to be fully operational by 2026. If this plant can consistently produce SAF at a cost that is significantly lower than current multi-step processes, it will trigger a massive shift in the industry. Look for major long-term licensing agreements with large energy or chemical producers, which would confirm the technology’s path to industrial scale and its ability to truly challenge the incumbent cost structure of fossil jet fuel.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Aviation-Infrastructure-Transformation-Towards-Net-Zero-Emissions-and-Resource-Stewardship.jpeg,N,,2025-09-30 13:56:13.368349

Chris Phebus, CTO of long-duration energy storage company Hydrostor, addressed the importance of his sector.
Phebus explained that the energy transition represents a period of immense technological innovation and advancement for the clean energy industry, driven by coalescing trends such as onshored manufacturing and the race for artificial intelligence, following decades of stagnant growth.
As a larger energy industry, “we have to move to a place where we’re building generation facilities like airplanes, not like airports,” she proclaimed.
The company also signed the world’s first power purchase agreement for fusion energy with Microsoft, with plans to start delivering energy in 2028.","During National Clean Energy Week, Chris Barnard, president of American Conservation Coalition (ACC), led a discussion about how the American energy sector is delivering abundant, affordable, and reliable energy. Leaders from some of the companies at the forefront of these efforts, including Gevo, Helion Energy, Hydrostor, LandGate, and the Smart Electric Power Alliance, also shared their perspectives on the topic.

Chris Phebus, CTO of long-duration energy storage company Hydrostor, addressed the importance of his sector. Through the company’s advanced compressed air energy storage solution, it can inject its compressed air into hard rock anywhere in the world and then deploy that energy when needed by tapping into the heat from the compression process or by pumping water up from its caverns. The company’s first four gigawatt-hour plant is operating in Ontario, and multiple other sites are in development for additional jurisdictions.

Phebus explained that the energy transition represents a period of immense technological innovation and advancement for the clean energy industry, driven by coalescing trends such as onshored manufacturing and the race for artificial intelligence, following decades of stagnant growth. “We’ve seen a lot of renewables come into the market, and those renewables create a lot of intermittent energy, and that creates the requirement, really, for storage,” he explained. He said that he sees Hydrostor as part of the solution for maintaining the grid balance during this time of transition and added, “You have to have long-duration energy storage to make them affordable and take advantage of the full capability that you’ve put into these markets.” However, Phebus voiced the need for policymaker support to continue moving forward: “These are mega projects. We need your support to put them in the ground. We are ready to go. We’re shovel-ready. We want to build these.”

Next, Lindsay Fitzgerald, Chief Advocacy and Communications Officer at Gevo, discussed how her company is changing the world with its cost-competitive renewable fuels and carbon abatement solutions. For example, she highlighted the company’s low-carbon ethanol production with on-site carbon capture and storage in Iowa, as well as efforts to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from that ethanol in North Dakota and South Dakota. She highlighted how the timing is important: “We’re seeing a decline in ethanol needs, and we’re seeing an increase in the demand for jet fuel. We’re all still flying, but guess what? We’re not building any new refineries, so that means we’re not refining any new jet fuel.” Instead of importing it, we can utilize the country’s existing ethanol infrastructure to produce SAF and potentially even export it, thereby supporting farmers through co-products that are all monetized: the fuel itself, protein for animal feed, and carbon from fermentation that can be sequestered.

Fitzgerald acknowledged several helpful policy levers, particularly the Section 45Z clean fuel production tax credit and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. However, she added that it is all still new and needs time: “You don’t build a whole new facility from scratch, or add on to an existing ethanol facility overnight. So this takes time. It takes some policy stability. Don’t put something in place and then a year later change it because no one’s responded. There hasn’t been time to respond to that yet.” In terms of company priorities, Gevo is working with farmers to help them figure out what regenerative practices they can employ on their land: “That’s a way to impact their bottom line, but that also means that they’re supplying us with corn that comes in with a lower carbon intensity,” which translates into lower-carbon-intensity fuel for Gevo. The company is also aware that it needs to portray its industry in a better light for global policy, because other countries “have this vision of agriculture from a dust bowl time, that is not agriculture today… And so there’s this huge educational push that we have to do as a country, as a group, to say our ag is not what you think it is. It’s not terrible, it’s wonderful.”

Jackie Siebens, vice president of public affairs at fusion company Helion Energy, explained her company’s mission to deploy commercial fusion to the grid as soon as possible. As a larger energy industry, “we have to move to a place where we’re building generation facilities like airplanes, not like airports,” she proclaimed. Helion has completed seven working fusion prototypes in twelve years, with the latest, Polaris, demonstrating electricity production from fusion for the first time. The company also signed the world’s first power purchase agreement for fusion energy with Microsoft, with plans to start delivering energy in 2028. Siebens noted that the company has successfully built numerous fusion machines in a remarkably short time period, even though it usually takes years to obtain design certification from a regulator, mainly because fusion creates far less radiation than fission processes. Therefore, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission classifies it using a different framework, which is also used for industrial and hospital equipment.

However, there is still a need to reach scale. “We want to make sure that we’re building fusion here, and that it’s America that’s reaping the economic and strategic benefits from this technology,” she said, pointing to how we lost the lead on both solar and chips and commenting, “We’re talking about losing the strategic advantage of this century if we do that with fusion.” On the same day as this panel, Reps. Carol Miller (R-WV), Suzan DelBene (D-WA), Claudia Tenney (R-NY), and Don Beyer (D-VA) introduced the Fusion Advanced Manufacturing Parity Act to expand the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit to include fusion energy components. “We are beyond excited about this,” Siebens said, because as the paradigm shifts from academic to commercial, “we need the government to come with us” by taking “proactive measures like making sure that manufacturing tax credits are available to the suppliers in this country for fusion, so that we can scale as we work towards demonstration.”

Alessandra Millican, managing director of energy and infrastructure at LandGate, then took to the stage to describe how her data and analytics company uses thousands of data points on every parcel of land in the U.S. to determine what type of energy generation it is best suited for. “So we basically take what used to be a very laborious, monotonous, time-consuming process and put it in one place,” Millican described. Digital modernization is more important than ever, and “what I’ve loved about transitioning to renewable energy is that almost every company embraces technology and embraces ‘Hey, how can we do things better?” she reflected.

At the same time, the data center gold rush is also a race for real estate, and “a lot of the project developers that I’ve had the pleasure of working with have seen just their projects die death by a thousand cuts” from planning and permitting processes. Millican highlighted grid modernization and interconnection reform as the two most significant challenges for the country to address right now. A lot of those projects get killed at state boundaries, but “if you’re an electron, you don’t care where state boundaries are.” So, she proposed, “If we gave FERC the authority to nationally regulate that process, that would help out. Same thing with permitting.” Solutions to address local opposition involve “looking at those communities and coming up with some sort of standardization, or, ‘Hey, let’s benefit the entire community here,’” rather than choosing to pay only some community members over their neighbors.

Finally, Lesley Jantarasami, vice president of research and industry strategy at the Smart Electric Power Alliance (SEPA), brought a wider lens of focus to the conversation, coming from a national nonprofit working with all segments of the power industry. She acknowledged that SEPA members and the industry at large are seeking solutions and innovations that can help advance the deployment of clean, reliable, resilient, and affordable energy. In the next five years, they are most excited about long-duration energy storage, the opportunity to bring renewable and geothermal energy resources online, and the opportunity to use technologies and software solutions “to get more out of the existing system” by harnessing distributed energy resources and aggregating small sources of energy into virtual power plants. While artificial intelligence is contributing to increased energy usage, Jantarasami also acknowledged that “it’s also part of the solution set.” For example, she highlighted Google’s partnership with PJM Interconnection to implement AI solutions on the power grid.

Jantarasami emphasized the importance of policy engagement for the country to move forward: “I think interconnection queues are a great example of why it’s so important to have this engagement at every level of policy, where federal, down to state and regional levels, are thinking through, ‘How do we get more electricity on the grid?’ ‘How do we ensure that the system as a whole is moving forward?’” While she recognized the uncertainty and long runway times for the deployment of new clean energy, she also pointed out that, particularly on the state level, “we’re still seeing a lot of progress, having a lot of interest in pushing forward on low emissions, decarbonized energy.” She listed policy tools such as clean energy standards, renewable portfolio standards, and energy efficiency resource standards, as well as energy storage targets in certain jurisdictions. According to Jantarasami, some of this process involves policymakers “getting comfort and familiarity with what these technologies can offer,” and then enabling “real-world pilots that show and demonstrate the benefits of these things, so that more regulators are comfortable with approving those types of projects.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1723839316249-1.jpeg,N,,2025-09-30 11:56:39.148734

According to Sadiqov, Azerbaijan’s renewable energy development strategy extends beyond export-oriented projects — it is also aimed at enhancing the reliability and resilience of the national energy system.

“Our main goal is not just to fix current gaps in the energy grid but to build a more sustainable and dependable system,” he said, adding: “Unstable energy holds no value — stability is everything.”

He emphasized the importance of energy storage systems, grid balancing mechanisms, and a diversified mix of renewable sources. Sadiqov also highlighted the growing significance of offshore wind and green hydrogen, noting that Masdar is actively investing in green hydrogen production and has already launched a pilot project for sustainable aviation fuel in the UAE. The company now aims to replicate that success in Azerbaijan.

He also pointed out that the Azerbaijani government is investing heavily in modernizing the national grid. Recently, two major energy storage systems were announced to help manage energy flow and frequency, which are expected to significantly boost the grid’s stability and performance.

Sadiqov underscored that Azerbaijan’s green energy ambitions are not limited to Europe-bound exports.

“We’ve also witnessed agreements being signed with Central Asian countries. This marks a step toward building a large, stable energy network across the region,” he said. “Azerbaijan is becoming the heart of an emerging energy hub — one that will play a critical role in the energy transition not only for the Caucasus but for the entire Eurasian region.”",https://www.azernews.az/media/2025/09/30/trend_masdar.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 11:56:45.613886

The Phantom 3500 promises to burn 60% less fuel than similar business jets — or up to 90% less if operating on sustainable aviation fuel.

Otto plans to build the plane at a new high-tech factory it intends to build in Jacksonville, Florida, supported by a $515 million incentive package from the state of Florida.

Reality check: It's taken nearly two decades for Otto to perfect the design of the clean-sheet aircraft, which features super-efficient, laminar-flow aerodynamics and precision carbon-fiber composites.

But its first flight won't occur until 2027 and it still needs FAA certification.

The big picture: Otto is one of dozens of ambitious mobility companies participating in at the UP.Summit, an invite-only gathering of 350 entrepreneurs and investors in Bentonville, Arkansas.

The event is a mix of dreamers, scientists and financiers with a shared mission to make transportation cleaner, faster, safer and cheaper — whether it's on the ground, in the air, at sea or in space.

Now in its eighth year, the private event is hosted by investment firm UP.Partners, Walmart scions Steuart and Tom Walton, and businessman Ross Perot Jr.

What to watch: Aviation is on the cusp of the biggest transformation since the introduction of the jet engine, which revolutionized air travel.

Our agreement with IRENA focuses on a partnership arrangement to facilitate financial resources through the ICAO Finvest@ETAF portal, for scaling up SAF and other cleaner energy solutions. It is a first-of-its-kind gateway between project developers and financiers, and this matchmaking function, using ICAO’s sustainability criteria, helps de-risk investments while ensuring environmental integrity, said Juan Carlos Salazar, Secretary General of ICAO.

Finvest@ETAF will serve as a single entry point for project developers seeking investment, linking proposals with a global network of public and private financiers.

Project submissions will undergo joint screening by IRENA and ICAO experts, combining technical due diligence with investment readiness assessments, before being presented to financing and de-risking partners under the Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) Platform.

While demand reduction and energy efficiency improvements will play a critical role in aligning the sector with IRENA’s 1.5 °C scenario, SAFs could account for 40–65 percent of the sector’s emission cuts by 2050, according to ICAO.

Sustainable aviation fuels will shape the future of flight, but the sector has yet to take off at the scale needed. By leveraging IRENA’s financing network and ICAO’s technical expertise, ‘Finvest@ETAF’ will support SAF projects across their entire lifecycle, bringing visibility to bankable projects while helping promising ideas develop into fully fledged proposals ready to attract investment and move into deployment, said Francesco La Camera, Director General at IRENA.

ICAO Innovation Fair centerpiece

The portal’s launch was a centerpiece of the ICAO Innovation Fair, where Salvatore Sciacchitano, President of the ICAO Council, emphasized that “Innovation is providing the foundation for continued progress and sustainable development for future generations.”

Project developers worldwide are invited to submit proposals to the portal, ensuring a strong pipeline of initiatives from every region.

The success of Finvest@ETAF will depend on a strong pipeline of projects from every region.

Working together through Finvest@ETAF, we can achieve our vision of offering green and vibrant air transport to all, added Juan Carlos Salazar.

The Innovation Fair provided a global platform to develop policy ideas and foster partnerships that will underpin progress towards ICAO’s Long-Term Strategic Plan, which envisions zero fatalities and net-zero carbon emission air transport for everyone, everywhere by mid-century.

The event featured dynamic panels and hands-on demonstrations covering advanced air mobility, digitalization, automation, and sustainable fuels.

The Fair also highlighted the essential role of youth and diversity in driving aviation’s transformation, with the ICAO Innovation Competition showcasing bold, youth-led solutions.",https://bioenergyinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/icaoirena.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 14:57:23.616030

OXCCU, an Oxford University spin-out focused on the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from waste carbon, has successfully concluded an oversubscribed Series B funding round, securing £20.75 million ($28 million). This substantial capital injection is earmarked to accelerate the commercialization of its proprietary technology, expand operational capacities, and advance the next phase of its technology scale-up. The funding round saw participation from new strategic investors including Orlen VC, Safran Corporate Ventures, and International Airlines Group (IAG) through its corporate venturing arm, IAGi Ventures. Existing investors such as Clean Energy Ventures, IP Group/Kiko Ventures, Aramco Ventures, and Eni Next also reiterated their support.

Deconstructing the Investment and Its Strategic Rationale

The oversubscribed nature of the Series B round underscores robust investor confidence in OXCCU's innovative approach to SAF production, particularly within a challenging capital market environment. This investment is not merely financial but strategically motivated by the aviation and energy sectors' imperative to decarbonize.

IAG's investment aligns directly with its ambitious goal to meet 10% of its fuel needs with SAF by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Similarly, Orlen VC's participation supports Orlen's ambition to become a leading SAF producer in Europe by 2035, targeting an annual production of 70,000 tons. Safran Corporate Ventures also invested, reinforcing Safran's commitment to aviation decarbonization, with goals to reduce its carbon footprint by 50% by 2025 and produce 100,000 tons of SAF annually by 2030.

Publicly traded early-stage science investor IP Group Plc (LSE: IPO) contributed £4 million to this round, now holding an undiluted beneficial stake of 15.2% in OXCCU. Following the announcement, IP Group Plc's stock recorded a +2.10% increase, reflecting positive market sentiment towards its strategic investments in climate technology.

OXCCU's Single-Step Process Aims to Transform SAF Production Economics

OXCCU's core technology utilizes a patented iron-based catalyst to directly synthesize jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon, including CO2 and green hydrogen, in a single exothermic reaction. This one-step conversion process is designed to bypass complex, energy-intensive multi-step methods, such as Reverse Water-Gas Shift (RWGS) and Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis, which are traditionally associated with high capital and operating costs.

According to OXCCU, this streamlined approach can reduce fuel costs per tonne by approximately 25% and capital costs by about 50% compared to conventional SAF production methods. The company launched its OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport in 2024. The new funding will support the development of its second demonstration plant, OX2, which is projected to be fully operational by 2026.

Broader Market Implications: Accelerating Aviation Decarbonization

The significant investment in OXCCU underscores the growing urgency and demand for scalable SAF solutions. While SAF is recognized as a critical tool for decarbonizing aviation, its current adoption remains low, with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) anticipating that SAF production will account for only 0.7% of airlines' total fuel consumption in 2025.

However, the global SAF market is projected for exponential growth, expanding from an estimated USD 882.13 million in 2024 to USD 64,187.6 million by 2033. This growth is propelled by increasing regulatory mandates, including the UK SAF mandate, ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, and the U.S. Department of Energy's ""Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge."" By offering a potentially cost-competitive solution, OXCCU is strategically positioned to address a major barrier to widespread SAF adoption: high production costs.

Expert Perspectives on the Future of Sustainable Aviation

Industry leaders emphasize the critical role of innovative technologies in scaling SAF production.

""In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving,"" stated Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. He added, ""What we’re seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.""

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at IAG, highlighted the airline group's proactive stance:

""We recognise the need for the world to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably. IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to 10% SAF by 2030 and we are developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.""

Outlook: Scaling Sustainable Solutions for the Aviation Sector

With the OX2 plant expected to be fully operational by 2026, OXCCU aims to have its first commercial plants running by the late 2020s, potentially making SAF available to aircraft operators as early as 2028 or 2029, contingent on establishing necessary partnerships for licensed production and distribution. While the company's technology promises to significantly reduce production costs, the final cost of Power-to-Liquid (PtL) SAF remains sensitive to the price of green hydrogen, a key input.",https://static.edgen.tech/news/images/dc1434c7375434282b48110106f4faa5.jpeg,N,,2025-09-30 12:57:35.977350

In addition to the 2050 goal, the law also set a binding EU climate goal to reduce net GHG by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990.
The new report indicated strong progress towards the EU’s interim climate goal, with GHG emissions falling by 37% since 1990, despite 60% GDP growth over the same period, and with the pace of annual emissions reductions in the EU doubling since 2005.
The report also indicated uneven progress by sector on GHG emissions reduction, finding that while energy supply emissions have declined by 49% since 2005, and industry emissions by 36%, domestic transport emissions have only come down by 6%, and agriculture sector emissions by 7%.
Recent extreme weather events show how fragile our prosperity and security become when nature is degraded, and climate impacts intensify.","The EU has made significant progress towards meeting its climate goals, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions by well over a third since 1990, despite economic growth, but continues to face growing risks to its competitiveness from climate change and environmental degradation, according to a new report by the European Environment Agency (EEA).

The new publication forms part of a series of five-yearly State of Europe’s environment reports released by the EEA as mandated by the European Commission, to provide a broad assessment of the environment, climate and sustainability in Europe.

The EU adopted a Climate Law in 2021, setting into legislation a goal to reach climate neutrality by 2050. In addition to the 2050 goal, the law also set a binding EU climate goal to reduce net GHG by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. More recently, the EU has committed to set a new 2035 GHG emissions reduction goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 66.25% to 72.5%, and the European Commission has proposed a new target, currently being debated by lawmakers, to reduce emissions by 90% by 2040.

The new report indicated strong progress towards the EU’s interim climate goal, with GHG emissions falling by 37% since 1990, despite 60% GDP growth over the same period, and with the pace of annual emissions reductions in the EU doubling since 2005.

The report cites significant shifts in the energy mix in Europe as a key source of the EU’s emission reduction progress, with the share of renewable energy sources doubling since 2005, and almost a quarter of final energy use in 2023 coming from renewable sources, 45% of all electricity used in the EU now generated by renewables, while fossil fuel use, and coal in particular, has declined.

Despite the energy transition progress, however, the report noted that roughly three-quarters of all EU GHG emissions come from burning fossil fuels for energy, and that that fossil fuels remain the dominant source of energy in Europe at almost 70% of EU gross available energy use in 2023, signaling a need for further investment to accelerate the deployment of renewables, and to drive large-scale electrification and switch industrial processes to cleaner fuels to substitute fossil fuel-based materials with renewable materials.

The report also indicated uneven progress by sector on GHG emissions reduction, finding that while energy supply emissions have declined by 49% since 2005, and industry emissions by 36%, domestic transport emissions have only come down by 6%, and agriculture sector emissions by 7%. While domestic transport emissions reductions are anticipated to accelerate over the next few years, agriculture emissions are expected to remain nearly flat through 2030, according to the report.

Despite the progress in reducing emissions, the report found that the EU faces significant and growing economic risks from climate change, noting that weather and climate-related events caused more than €738 billion in losses from 1980 to 2023, including over €162 billion in the last three years. The report cited estimates that climate impacts could cut EU GDP by 7% by the end of the century, with estimated losses of €2.4 trillion from 2031 to 2050 if warming surpasses 1.5°C, and highlighting high-exposure sectors such as agriculture, forestry, mining and quarrying, and construction.

The report also indicated that progress is lagging in some areas, including finding that the state of biodiversity in Europe is declining, with 81% of habitats in a poor or bad state, and describing the near-term future outlook for biodiversity as “bleak,” with previous targets for ecosystems not being met, and pressures on ecosystems remaining high.

Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition, Teresa Ribera, said:

“This report is a stark reminder that Europe must stay the course and even accelerate our climate and environmental ambitions. Recent extreme weather events show how fragile our prosperity and security become when nature is degraded, and climate impacts intensify. Delaying or postponing our climate targets would only increase costs, deepen inequalities, and weaken our resilience. Protecting nature is not a cost. It is an investment in competitiveness, resilience and the well-being of our citizens. By scaling up action now, we can build a cleaner, fairer and more resilient Europe for future generations.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EU-environment-report-2025.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 11:57:39.085972

The U.S. is the third largest biodiesel producer globally and exported around 7.15 million barrels in 2022.

Biodiesels production adds roughly $32,823 in profit to a 1,000-acre farm, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The U.S. is on track to surpass 5 billion gallons of combined biodiesel and renewable diesel consumption in 2024.

It can be produced from a variety of non-food feedstocks such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and non-edible plant oils, which are more readily available and easier to process than lignocellulosic biomass required for cellulosic ethanol or bio-butanol. Additionally, biodiesel meets established fuel standards and can be blended easily with petroleum diesel, requiring no major engine modifications. Its lower production cost and faster commercialization have made it more accessible than other advanced fuels.

Feedstock Analysis

Fuels Produced from Lignocellulosic Biomass Led the Second-Generation Biofuel Market.

On the basis of feedstock, the second-generation biofuel market is segmented into lignocellulosic biomass, agricultural residues, forest residues, municipal solid waste (MSW), and others. Lignocellulosic biomass fuels dominated the market in 2024 with a market share of 35.6%. Second-generation biofuels are mostly produced from lignocellulosic biomass because it offers a more consistent, energy-dense, and abundant source of non-food organic material compared to agricultural residues, forest residues, or municipal solid waste (MSW).

Lignocellulosic biomass, such as dedicated energy crops like switchgrass, miscanthus, or fast-growing trees, is specifically cultivated or harvested for biofuel production, ensuring better control over quality and supply. In contrast, agricultural and forest residues are seasonal and scattered, making collection and transport more challenging, while MSW is highly heterogeneous and often contaminated, requiring complex sorting and pretreatment. This makes lignocellulosic biomass a more reliable and scalable feedstock for biofuel production.

End-User Analysis

In 2024, the Second-Generation Biofuel Market was Primarily Driven by Automotive & Road Transportation.

Based on the end-users of second-generation biofuels, the market is divided into automotive & road transportation, aviation, marine, and industrial & power. These biofuels are used in large amounts in automotive and road transportation, with around 65.1% of the market share. Most second-generation biofuels are used in automotive and road transportation because these sectors have more flexible fuel infrastructure and engine compatibility compared to aviation, marine, or industrial power. Liquid biofuels, with over 1.1 EJ, account for the most growth in the transport sector, since they are compatible with the existing vehicle fleet with minimal modifications, making adoption easier and more cost-effective.

In contrast, aviation and marine fuels require very specific properties for safety, energy density, and performance, which advanced biofuels like sustainable aviation fuel or bio-DME are still developing at scale. Additionally, regulatory frameworks and incentives have historically focused more on road transport emissions, accelerating second-generation biofuel use in this sector. While biofuels for road transport dominate expansion, new policies for aviation and maritime biofuels spur nearly 30% of new demand in the transport sector overall.

Drivers

Demand for Climate Change Mitigation Drives the Second-Generation Biofuel Market.

The growing demand for effective climate change mitigation strategies is a key driver of the second-generation biofuel market. Unlike first-generation biofuels, which are produced from food crops such as corn and sugarcane, second-generation biofuels are derived from non-food lignocellulosic biomass such as agricultural residues, forest waste, and dedicated energy crops such as switchgrass and miscanthus.

This reduces competition for food resources and lowers greenhouse gas emissions significantly. Burning one gallon of gasoline produces approximately 8.89 kilograms of CO2, the primary greenhouse gas from fuel combustion. Depending on the type of advanced biofuel used, the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by 40-85% compared to gasoline. For instance, in the best-case scenario, cellulosic ethanol can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 86% compared to gasoline. Countries such as the United States, China, India, and Brazil are investing heavily in biorefineries that convert waste biomass into sustainable fuels.

Restraints

Limited Availability of Feedstock and Operational Challenge of Scaling Up Might Hamper the Growth of the Market.

Despite its potential, the second-generation biofuel market faces significant challenges related to feedstock availability and the complexities of scaling up production. Lignocellulosic biomass, such as agricultural residues, forestry waste, and dedicated energy crops, is not always readily available in sufficient quantities at consistent quality. Seasonal variability, logistical constraints, and competition with other uses such as animal bedding or soil enhancement limit its accessibility.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, although over 1 billion tons of biomass are theoretically available annually in the United States, only a fraction is economically collectible due to infrastructure and transportation issues. Additionally, scaling up from pilot to commercial-scale bio-refineries presents technical and operational hurdles, including maintaining process efficiency, ensuring reliable enzyme performance at scale, and managing large volumes of heterogeneous feedstock. These issues could slow the market’s progress without targeted solutions.

Opportunity

Policy Frameworks Create Opportunities in the Second-Generation Biofuel Market.

Supportive policy frameworks play a crucial role in creating opportunities for the development and deployment of second-generation biofuels. Governments around the world are implementing mandates, subsidies, and regulatory incentives to encourage the production of low-carbon fuels from non-food biomass. For instance, the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) sets targets for renewable energy in transport, specifically promoting the use of advanced biofuels derived from agricultural and forestry residues.

Similarly, according to the IEA, meeting net-zero goals by 2050 would require biofuels to account for nearly 30% of total transport energy. The support policies vary by fuel, sector, and country, but often include a combination of mandates, GHG performance criteria, and direct production and CAPEX investment incentives. For instance, in September 2025, the federal government of Canada announced plans to invest CA$370 million in biofuel production incentives. These policy-driven initiatives are vital for scaling sustainable fuel alternatives.

Trends

Focus on Technological Advancements.

Technological advancements continue to be a key trend shaping the second-generation biofuel market, enabling more efficient and cost-effective production. For instance, the use of algae for producing bio-oils and renewable diesel. Industries in the aviation and marine sectors are recognizing the potential of algae-based fuels, as they solve a major problem of feedstock availability. Similarly, innovations in pretreatment processes, such as pyrolysis, have significantly improved the breakdown of organic waste into bio-oil, biochar, and gases rich in carbon monoxide and hydrogen. These outputs serve as building blocks for various end products, such as liquid transportation fuels and green chemicals.

Furthermore, startups and biotech giants alike are employing synthetic biology to create genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The approach is trying to develop microbes and enzymes that can efficiently convert biomass and waste materials into advanced biofuels. Moreover, emerging technologies like consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) integrate enzyme production, hydrolysis, and fermentation into a single step, streamlining the biofuel production chain. These innovations are essential to improving scalability and commercial viability in the second-generation biofuel sector.

Geopolitical Impact Analysis

Geopolitical Tensions Leading to Supply Chain Disruptions in the Second-Generation Biofuel Market.

Geopolitical tensions can significantly impact the second-generation biofuel market by disrupting supply chains, altering trade policies, and shifting energy security priorities. Conflicts or diplomatic strains can hinder the global movement of critical components such as enzymes, catalysts, or specialized machinery required for bio-refinery operations.

For instance, amidst the Israel-Iran conflict, in the Middle East, low sulfur gas oil (LSGO) prices surged from US$84/mt to US$716/mt, reflecting broader energy market volatility stemming from the conflict.

Similarly, used cooking oil (UCO) markets displayed regional variations, with Netherlands EXW prices holding steady at EUR 1,033/mt while Chinese FOB prices moderated to US$990/mt from US$1,000/mt. However, current US import tariffs of 55% on Chinese goods create significant cost barriers for UCO imports. On the other hand, global instability can redirect public funds away from renewable energy initiatives toward immediate defense or humanitarian needs. For instance, the Russia-Ukraine conflict disrupted agricultural output and trade in Europe, affecting biomass availability like wheat straw, a key feedstock for second-generation biofuels in the region.

Regional Analysis

North America was the Largest Market for Second-Generation Biofuel in 2024.

North America held the major share of the global second-generation biofuel market, valued at around US$5.34 billion, commanding an estimated 38.7% of the total revenue share. The U.S. and Brazil produced 80% of the total ethanol produced globally. The region has emerged as the largest market for biofuels, largely due to strong policy support, technological leadership, and abundant biomass resources. The United States, in particular, has implemented comprehensive regulations such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which mandates that the transportation fuel sold in the United States contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels.

According to IEA, in 2023, ethanol production reached 116 billion liters, which was around 70% of liquid biofuels, and the U.S. and Brazil, combined, produced 80% of it.

Additionally, the country produces large quantities of agricultural residues with estimates around over 140 million dry tons per year from major crops alone, including corn stover and wheat straw, that serve as key feedstocks for lignocellulosic biofuel production. Similarly, leading bio-refineries such as POET-DSM’s Project LIBERTY in Iowa and DuPont’s Nevada plant in Iowa, although closed, have played a pioneering role in commercializing cellulosic ethanol.

Furthermore, Canada is advancing in the sector, with supportive federal and provincial clean fuel standards encouraging the development of low-carbon fuel alternatives. The combination of favorable policy frameworks, research & development investment, and feedstock availability positions North America at the forefront of second-generation biofuel innovation and adoption.

Creativity and efficiency are becoming the new operating models for economic and community development, defining which regions will lead in the next chapter of the energy transition.

This was made clear earlier this month at the International Economic Development Council (IEDC) conference in Detroit, where RMI convened a panel of leaders to explore how US regions can capture advanced energy opportunities as federal support wanes but energy demand heats up. The discussion built on RMI’s recent insights, Scaling Clean Energy with Regional Financing Ecosystems, which highlights how capital providers with a stake in local economic development pursue aligned goals, but too often in silos.

Panelists included Scott Beckerman, Senior Vice President and Director of Corporate Sustainability at Comerica; Martha Campbell, Chief Program Officer at Michigan Saves; John Moon, President of LISC Green LLC; and Amanda Taylor, Vice President of Business Investment at Greater MSP Partnership.

The panel discussion elevated three lessons on this moment and what lies ahead for economic development leaders.

Lesson 1: Today’s strong pipelines require new strategies to overcome uncertainty

In recent years, unprecedented federal incentives have revealed a strong pipeline of clean energy projects across the United States. John Moon shared that LISC used an interest form for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) to measure demand and identified nearly $1 billion in potential projects, with around $150 million ready to move this year. Even without GGRF grants, LISC plans to deploy $100 million in sustainable finance over the next three years– but reaching the lowest-income communities without concessional capital will be difficult and dependent on strong city and state incentives.

Michigan Saves faces a similar challenge. Over 15 years, the green bank has enabled more than $600 million in residential energy efficiency loans by leveraging loan-loss reserves to attract private capital. A GGRF subaward would have enabled an expansion into direct commercial lending. With those funds on hold, Michigan Saves is working to raise private capital and sharpen its value proposition to compete without subsidies.

Panelists cautioned that today’s strong project pipeline faces uncertainty from expiring solar and wind tax credits and impending Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) regulations. Developers and capital providers nationwide are scrambling to complete or safe harbor projects, but what comes next is less clear. Technologies whose credits have longer runway, such as geothermal and storage, could emerge stronger.

Lesson 2: Competitiveness will be shaped by demand

Policy-driven uncertainty isn’t the only factor shaping market outlook. Rising energy demand, grid needs, and long interconnection queues will be just as decisive. Globally, AI is accelerating the need for electricity and water for data centers. In the United States, meeting that demand is vital to maintaining resilient, competitive economies. If investment lags, businesses and households will face higher costs and reliability risks.

As Beckerman observed, banks don’t like uncertainty, yet it has defined 2025. Comerica initially entered clean energy financing because the deals were sound business opportunities, not pure sustainability plays. That still holds true. “We’ll be forced to deploy our creativity,” he said, emphasizing that while capital stacks may evolve, advanced and clean energy projects will continue — driven both by investors’ pressure on global companies to decarbonize and by the sheer growth in energy needs.

The Minneapolis–Saint Paul region offers an example of how local leaders can respond strategically to corporate demand. After hearing airline CEOs express interest in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the region began building a value chain that connects feedstock, technology providers, and buyers. As Taylor advised, economic developers should listen closely to what Fortune 500 companies need, and work collaboratively across their region to align solutions with local strengths. That alignment of corporate demand with regional capabilities positions places to compete globally.

Lesson 3: Regions must balance short-term competitiveness with long-term resilience

Economic developers must act as the “strategic brains” of their regions, helping communities balance near-term competitiveness with long-term resilience. Campbell suggested a dual-track strategy: on the one hand, expansively pursuing growth opportunities by attracting foreign direct investment, scaling advanced and cleantech energy clusters, and aligning with global megatrends; at the same time, planning for long-term shifts by hedging against worst-case scenarios such as slowing population growth, and by rethinking infrastructure and city design for sustainable growth.

Panelists acknowledged the challenge of holding near-term needs together while advancing a long-term vision like decarbonization. Data centers illustrate this tension in real-time, as communities wrestle with how to weigh potential tax revenue against impacts on power and water systems. More constructive approaches to data center development are possible, including negotiating with companies to secure workforce training programs, infrastructure investment, or other commitments that build long-term resilience alongside competitiveness.

From uncertainty to regional leadership

The panel discussion in Detroit underscored that while federal uncertainty looms, the regions best positioned to thrive are those building robust financing ecosystems by designing public incentives to attract private dollars, aligning with corporate demand, building coalitions to de-risk projects, and sharpening strategies to deliver dollars more efficiently.

Clean and advanced energy projects will continue. The real question is which regions will rise to meet the moment, using creativity not only to attract investment but also to secure durable, inclusive benefits for their communities.

The GPS-CSIR-NCL collaboration offers a powerful home-grown solution that could redefine sustainable aviation fuel production in India and beyond.","GPS Renewables, a leading global full-stack renewable oil and gas company specializing in climate-positive biofuel solutions, has partnered with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research – National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL) to develop a first-of-its-kind commercial-scale technology for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from ethanol. The same breakthrough technology can also convert methanol into SAF. This expands its potential applications.

Transforming Ethanol into Jet Fuel with Breakthrough Catalytic Technology

As part of this strategic collaboration, GPS Renewables will invest in scaling up a technology that CSIR-NCL developed using a patented catalyst. This catalyst joins small molecules, such as ethylene and other olefins, in a one-step oligomerization process to form larger hydrocarbons that mimic the properties of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF).

While several research groups have demonstrated the ethanol-to-jet fuel process at the laboratory level, commercial-scale production has remained out of reach — until now. With a licensed technology from CSIR-NCL, GPS Renewables will engineer a commercial-scale SAF plant under the project brand “NG SAF.” As part of the agreement, GPS holds exclusive rights to commercialize this technology, marking a major milestone in India’s clean aviation fuel landscape.

Addressing Feedstock Challenges with a Home-Grown Alternative

Currently, producers make most commercial SAF using the HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) pathway, relying on feedstocks such as used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats. However, in India, the lack of an organized UCO collection system poses major challenges to scaling SAF production through the HEFA route. Additionally, FSSAI restrictions on importing UCO further limit production.

This is where the NG SAF initiative offers a transformative alternative. By using ethanol derived from 2G biomass — a key product of India’s agri-biomass ecosystem — the new technology provides a sustainable, scalable, and indigenous pathway to SAF production. This solution is not only aligned with India’s biofuel strategy but also critical to meeting its aviation sector’s decarbonization goals.

Industry Voices

Gomatam Ravi, CTO, GPS Renewables, expressed, “We are thrilled to partner with CSIR-NCL to build an indigenous and breakthrough SAF technology that can position India as a leader in SAF production. At GPS, we have always prioritized technology that can fast-track India’s transition to clean energy, and this collaboration reflects that commitment. While many have demonstrated the process at lab scale, none have succeeded in producing SAF from ethanol at an industrial scale. With NG SAF, we aim to change that. We are confident that with our expertise in scaling cleantech solutions and CSIR-NCL’s scientific backing, we can deliver an indigenous and industrially viable SAF solution to the world.”

Dr. Ashish Lele, Director, CSIR-NCL, highlighted, “One of our core strengths at CSIR-NCL lies in working closely with industry leaders to transform disruptive ideas into commercially deployable solutions. Scientific research, when coupled with industry collaboration, can create promising solutions to address global challenges. This indigenous technology, named NG SAF, based on CSIR-NCL’s patented oligomerization process, can be a game-changer to decarbonize the aviation sector. GPS Renewables’ proven track record and extensive experience in clean fuels make them an ideal partner to take this innovation from the lab to the market.”

Building a World-Class Team to Deliver NG SAF

All feedstocks considered meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use.

The study, in partnership with Worley Consulting, also identified significant barriers in using that feedstock for SAF production, namely:

The slow pace of technology rollout that would enable SAF to be produced from varied sources. Currently the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use HEFA technology, for example converting used cooking oil into SAF.

Competition with other potential users of the same feedstock. Policies allocating biomass feedstock to hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation must be prioritized.

Airlines will need 500 million tonnes (Mt) of SAF to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as outlined in the IATA Net Zero Roadmaps. This can be achieved from two main sources:

Biomass: This has the potential to produce more than 300 Mt of bio-SAF annually by 2050. Some of this potential could be limited by use for competing sources. This potential could be expanded by unlocking additional feedstocks or through efficiency gains and technology improvements over intervening decades.

Power-to-liquid (PtL): This will be required to reach 500 Mt of SAF production annually by 2050. Maximizing the volumes of cost-effective bio-SAF will reduce the pressure on e-SAF to bridge the gap.

In all cases, to maximize SAF output, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions.

“We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritized then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonization. There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Key findings from the report include:

There are sufficient sustainable feedstocks and SAF production technologies to decarbonize aviation and meet the net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050.

With the right policies and investments, more than 300 Mt of SAF from biomass feedstocks could be produced annually by mid-century and around 200 Mt from e-SAF.

The main challenges are:

Enhancing the feedstock supply chain infrastructure, scaling up novel sources that meet sustainability criteria, and ensuring that the feedstocks identified for SAF production are made available to the air transport industry.

Accelerating technology rollout to unlock new SAF production technologies, especially PtL, including reliable access to the low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure which are all required as part of the PtL production method.

Achieving coordinated government policies to support innovation, and investment to create a fully functioning SAF market, unlocking new economic opportunities.

Rallying regional leadership, with North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN identified as key drivers of global SAF output.

Activating the energy industry to invest in SAF production capacity, support technology commercialization, and align their business strategies with global decarbonization goals.

“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals. Governments, energy producers, investors, and the aviation sector must work together, de-risk investment, and accelerate rollout. Policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration are essential to unlock the scale we need. The time to act is now—delays will only make the challenge harder,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

PA Consulting’s latest global report, Cacophony to Symphony: Successfully scaling sustainable aviation fuel, draws on insights from nearly 600 senior leaders across airlines, airports, investors, producers, regulators, and policymakers. The findings show that only 19% of U.S. stakeholders are actively using or investing in SAF – 4% below the global average – but U.S. respondents are among the most confident in SAF’s potential to decarbonize aviation and drive job creation.

Other key findings from the report include:

· SAF is seen as achieving more than just sustainability goals – 59% of investors, airlines, and airport respondents see SAF as critical to national energy security.

· Most airports lack a clear path to sustainability – 53% of U.S. airport respondents don’t have a SAF strategy and almost half (47%) haven’t drawn up a net zero roadmap.

· The industry is united behind the promise of SAF – 93%of U.S. respondents cite SAF as essential to aviation’s decarbonization efforts but only 34%believe widespread adoption will be achieved by 2030.

· Infrastructure remains the biggest hurdle – 83% of U.S. respondents cite lack of infrastructure for SAF distribution and storage as a major barrier, significantly higher than global peers.

The U.S. is not alone in these challenges, and globally, more targeted and faster measures could help overcome key barriers and unlock SAF’s full potential. Emerging policy frameworks, regional SAF hubs, and private sector momentum are contributing to confidence in SAF’s scalability.

Kata Cserep, global aviation lead at PA Consulting, said, “There’s a quiet confidence building across the U.S. aviation industry that SAF is more than just a climate solution – it's an economic opportunity. This optimism is well-founded, as SAF has the potential to transform aviation and unlock regional economic growth. But belief must be matched by bold, coordinated action. Unlocking the full potential of SAF demands greater collaboration and investment across the entire ecosystem – from policymakers, investors and producers through to airlines, airports and regulators.”

CHICAGO, IL – September 18, 2025 – LanzaJet, Inc., a leading next-gen fuels technology company and producer of sustainable fuels, has been awarded more than $13 million (£10 million) from the UK Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) to accelerate development of Project Speedbird, a major sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) biorefinery in Teesside, United Kingdom being developed primarily for LanzaJet investor and SAF customer British Airways.

The award will support the next phase of work on Project Speedbird as it progresses into Front-End Engineering Design (FEED), marking a key milestone in the creation of one of the UK’s first commercial-scale ethanol-to-SAF production facilities using waste-based feedstocks. Among the projects selected in this round of the AFF, Speedbird received the largest award, underscoring LanzaJet’s advancement in the SAF industry, the maturity of the project, and the UK’s commitment to moving beyond pilots toward industrial deployment.

Project Speedbird is set to transform the aviation sector by producing SAF from low-carbon ethanol using LanzaJet’s patented and fully integrated Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology. The LanzaJet solution incorporates Technip Energies’ Hummingbird® ethanol-to-ethylene technology, which Project Speedbird has licensed, and which is deployed at commercial demonstration scale for the first time at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Georgia, USA.

Once Project Speedbird is operational, the facility is expected to produce over 30 million gallons (approximately 90 kilotons) of sustainable fuels from low-carbon ethanol each year, significantly reducing lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fossil jet fuel.

“We’ve maintained a long-held belief that creating a new industry requires partnership across the public and private sectors. We’re proud to collaborate with the UK Department for Transport to advance Project Speedbird as a leading project catalyzing SAF development in the UK,” said Jimmy Samartzis, Chief Executive Officer at LanzaJet. ​“This support demonstrates confidence in LanzaJet as a leading SAF company, in our ATJ technology, and in the critical role of ethanol-to-SAF in delivering economic growth, creating jobs, and decarbonizing air travel. Project Speedbird is vital to building a national SAF industry in the UK and to unlocking opportunity and innovation in the region. We thank the UK Department for Transport for its leadership and vision in accelerating the transition to net-zero aviation.”

The project aligns with the UK Government’s SAF mandate, which requires 10% of jet fuel used in the UK to come from sustainable sources by 2030.

Located in the heart of Teesside, the LanzaJet plant will also deliver significant regional benefits – creating hundreds of jobs, boosting the local economy, and contributing to the region’s position as a clean energy hub. By anchoring the project in Teesside, LanzaJet is helping to build out a broader ecosystem for sustainable fuels, one that connects local feedstock providers, renewable energy producers, and storage and distribution partners. In doing so, the project supports the UK’s broader net-zero strategy and the Government’s ambition for the country to become a global SAF leader.",https://lanza-jet.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/news/Speedbird-AFF-2025_LJR8.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1759163381&s=0bcd1044c7578489f8965a34d145c56e,N,,2025-09-29 18:56:32.164313

Or, maybe you're an environmentally minded person, and you've heard you can buy these things called carbon offsets.
It's connected to something that stores or reduces carbon emissions — for example, planting trees, or funding renewable energy.
Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, has studied carbon offsets for more than 20 years.
Instead of buying carbon offsets, Haya said she donates $1,000 to an organization she cares about on the rare occasion she flies for work or family visits.","So you're booking your flight, and just when you're about to check out, the airline asks if you'd like to pay a little something to offset your share of the flight's pollution. Or, maybe you're an environmentally minded person, and you've heard you can buy these things called carbon offsets.Are they worth it?Related video above: Worried about climate change? Fight back and save money A round-trip flight from New York to Los Angeles emits more than 1,300 pounds (about 614 kilograms) of planet-warming carbon dioxide per passenger, according to an emissions calculator from the International Civil Aviation Organization. That's about the amount of pollution you'd save if you swore off meat for 17 months.Jet engines burn fossil fuels, releasing planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. They also release water vapor, which turns into long, thin clouds called contrails that trap heat instead of letting it escape to space — additional warming that isn't typically included in a flight's emissions, said Diane Vitry, aviation director at a clean energy advocacy organization called the European Federation for Transport and Environment.Reducing emissions from air travel is difficult. Batteries weigh too much and provide too little power for long flights. Sustainable aviation fuel — biofuels made from things like corn, oil seeds and algae that can be mixed with jet fuel — is currently more expensive than traditional fuel and lacks sufficient supply to be in wide use.""Aviation is the problem child,"" Vitry said. ""Aviation and shipping are not decarbonizing, and definitely not fast enough.""That's where carbon offsets come in. A carbon offset is a certificate or a permit to emit planet-warming gases. It's connected to something that stores or reduces carbon emissions — for example, planting trees, or funding renewable energy.The idea is that the program or action offsets your polluting action. You drive a car that pollutes a certain amount, you buy a carbon offset that leads to the planting of a tree that sequesters the same amount, and bam: the polluting action (driving) is offset (tree planting).They've gotten popular enough that there's an entire marketplace that connects people and companies wanting to reduce their impacts with other companies that promise to do so. Vitry doesn't think so. She calls them a fake climate solution.""Unfortunately, it is not what is going to solve aviation's climate problem,"" she said. ""You can't clear your climate conscience with an offset.""Sure, you can plant a tree, but Vitry said that doesn't stop your flight's emissions from entering the atmosphere. The tree may eventually absorb an equivalent amount of emissions. Or it may die. Or it may be sold as an offset multiple times by an unscrupulous company, meaning the tree can't possibly absorb all the emissions it's supposed to.Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, has studied carbon offsets for more than 20 years.

So you're booking your flight, and just when you're about to check out, the airline asks if you'd like to pay a little something to offset your share of the flight's pollution. Or, maybe you're an environmentally minded person, and you've heard you can buy these things called carbon offsets.

Are they worth it?

A round-trip flight from New York to Los Angeles emits more than 1,300 pounds (about 614 kilograms) of planet-warming carbon dioxide per passenger, according to an emissions calculator from the International Civil Aviation Organization. That's about the amount of pollution you'd save if you swore off meat for 17 months.

Jet engines burn fossil fuels, releasing planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. They also release water vapor, which turns into long, thin clouds called contrails that trap heat instead of letting it escape to space — additional warming that isn't typically included in a flight's emissions, said Diane Vitry, aviation director at a clean energy advocacy organization called the European Federation for Transport and Environment.

Reducing emissions from air travel is difficult. Batteries weigh too much and provide too little power for long flights. Sustainable aviation fuel — biofuels made from things like corn, oil seeds and algae that can be mixed with jet fuel — is currently more expensive than traditional fuel and lacks sufficient supply to be in wide use.

""Aviation is the problem child,"" Vitry said. ""Aviation and shipping are not decarbonizing, and definitely not fast enough.""

That's where carbon offsets come in.

A carbon offset is a certificate or a permit to emit planet-warming gases. It's connected to something that stores or reduces carbon emissions — for example, planting trees, or funding renewable energy.

The idea is that the program or action offsets your polluting action. You drive a car that pollutes a certain amount, you buy a carbon offset that leads to the planting of a tree that sequesters the same amount, and bam: the polluting action (driving) is offset (tree planting).

They've gotten popular enough that there's an entire marketplace that connects people and companies wanting to reduce their impacts with other companies that promise to do so.

Vitry doesn't think so. She calls them a fake climate solution.

""Unfortunately, it is not what is going to solve aviation's climate problem,"" she said. ""You can't clear your climate conscience with an offset.""

Sure, you can plant a tree, but Vitry said that doesn't stop your flight's emissions from entering the atmosphere. The tree may eventually absorb an equivalent amount of emissions. Or it may die. Or it may be sold as an offset multiple times by an unscrupulous company, meaning the tree can't possibly absorb all the emissions it's supposed to.

Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, has studied carbon offsets for more than 20 years. She said some offset schemes are overcounted by 10 to 13 times their actual value.

""There's so much over-crediting on the offset market, so many credits that either don't represent any emissions reductions at all or represent just a small fraction of what they claim,"" Haya said.

She said that's partly because the voluntary offset market is largely unregulated, and it's really difficult to measure offsets. The other problem is that everyone involved benefits from over-exaggerating the benefits of offsets.

""The buyer of the credit wants the cheap credits, the seller of the credits wants to get more credits for the same activity and the third-party verifier is hired by the project developer, so has a conflict of interest to be lenient,"" Haya said.

Jodi Manning, chief executive of the carbon offset nonprofit Cool Effect, said consumers should beware of offset programs that don't say clearly which project will benefit from your purchase or how much of your money is going to a project. But she said ""high-quality"" carbon credits can play an important role where emissions are unavoidable.

Manning said offsets have to be permanent and transparent and that they are unable to exist without the offset funding.

""When carbon is done correctly, it can provide a credible, immediate way to account for the emissions that travelers cannot otherwise reduce. We all create emissions at some point, and it is certainly better to take action to compensate for it than to do nothing,"" she said.

All feedstocks considered in the study meet strict sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use.

Airlines will need about 500 million tons of SAF per year by 2050 to achieve climate targets. According to the study:

Biomass could provide more than 300 million tons annually.

The balance will require advanced technologies such as power-to-liquid (PtL), which use renewable electricity, hydrogen, and captured carbon.

The main constraint is not the availability of feedstock but the slow pace of technology rollout.

Currently, the only commercial-scale SAF production facilities use HEFA technology, which converts materials such as used cooking oil into jet fuel.

“We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritized then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonization,” said Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA, shared. “However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now.”

Marie Owens Thomsen, Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist at IATA, emphasized the wider benefits:

“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals. Policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration are essential to unlock the scale we need.”

The report highlights the importance of North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN in scaling up SAF production. These regions are expected to play leading roles in converting feedstock potential into actual supply.

SAF is central to IATA’s Net-Zero 2050 roadmap, expected to account for up to 65% of required emission reductions. Yet global production in 2025 is only a fraction of the demand that will be needed in the coming decades.

Walsh concluded:

“With this study it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonization. The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality.”",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250928-184622-700-White%20Airliner%20Wing%20on%20Top%20of%20Sea%20Clouds.png.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 19:56:55.195356

OXCCU Raises $28m in Series B Funding to Scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel from Waste Carbon

● Backed by global leaders in aviation, energy, and climate investing, OXCCU strengthens its position as a critical player in the global push for commercially viable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

● Series B investors include IAGi Ventures (the dedicated corporate venturing arm of the International Airlines Group), Safran Corporate Ventures, and Orlen VC alongside re-investment from world-class Series A participants.

OXFORD, England, September 29th 9 AM BST - OXCCU, the Oxford University spin-out developing a one-step process to convert waste carbon into SAF, has raised £20.75 million ($28 million) in an oversubscribed Series B funding round. The round includes new investors Orlen VC, Safran Corporate Ventures, International Airlines Group (IAG), Hostplus, and TCVC, alongside continued support from existing backers Clean Energy Ventures, IP Group, Aramco Ventures, Eni Next, Braavos Capital, and the University of Oxford.

This new capital will enable OXCCU to accelerate its commercialisation efforts, expand its operations, and advance its next phase of technology scale-up. It builds on the launch of the company's OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport in 2024. Their second demonstration plant, OX2, is underway and will be fully operational in 2026.

The announcement comes at a time of growing regulatory momentum and market demand for sustainable fuels. However, despite mandates such as the UK SAF mandate and ReFuelEU, high production costs remain a major barrier to widespread adoption.

""In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we're solving,"" said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. ""What we're seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.""

The funding reflects increasing recognition that driving down SAF production costs is critical to unlocking aviation decarbonisation at scale. OXCCU's process simplifies SAF production pathways by eliminating the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps. Instead, its patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction. This reduces capital and operating costs, and reduces the carbon intensity of the fuel.

The catalyst's ability to operate with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen input gas compositions gives it the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks such as reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at International Airlines Group (IAG), said: ""We recognise the need for the world to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably. IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030. Meeting these goals will be supported by this investment into OXCCU which is part of our strategy of developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.""

Ireneusz Fąfara, President of the Management Board of ORLEN, said: ""We invest in the technologies of tomorrow to effectively transform our business. This year, we introduced SAF - sustainable aviation fuel produced from renewable and waste raw materials - into our offering. In line with our strategy, by 2035 we aim to become one of the leading producers of SAF in Europe. Supporting the achievement of this goal is a new investment by ORLEN VC in the technology of OXCCU, a company enabling the conversion of green hydrogen and carbon dioxide into synthetic aviation fuel. Its commercialization will strengthen our market competitiveness and support our pursuit of carbon neutrality.""

Nathalie Stubler, Safran Chief Sustainability Officer comments: ""At Safran, we are committed to advancing the decarbonization of aviation. In addition to the development of new technologies in our own products such as engines and aircraft equipment, we are also supporting the de-risking and industrial scale-up of the most promising sustainable aviation fuel technologies.""

Daniel Goldman, Managing Partner and Co-founder of Clean Energy Ventures, said: ""OXCCU stands out not only for its differentiated technology but also for the speed of its progress toward commercial plants. In just a few years, the company has advanced from the lab to a commercial demonstration facility, proving that waste carbon and hydrogen can be converted directly into jet fuel at low cost. That rapid progress is reshaping the sustainable aviation fuel market, unlocking the affordability aviation needs to decarbonize. With the extraordinary leadership team and support of its strategic investors, we are confident OXCCU will lead the decarbonization of fuels and chemicals in the coming years.""

Dr Robert Trezona, Partner, Cleantech at IP Group, said: ""This round is a significant milestone, not just for the Company, but for the sector - significant capital being put to work from established industry actors on a credible path to fully decarbonise aviation. OXCCU showcases the UK's ability to lead in climate innovation, turning world-class science into global solutions, while generating jobs and lasting impact. We're proud to continue to support the company as it scales its compelling single-step technology.""

OXCCU's solution meets both environmental and commercial demands, with applications that extend beyond aviation into chemicals and plastics.

""This is a critical time for climate tech, as the urgency continues to increase"" added Symes. ""Aviation needs a solution, and the serious lever is SAF. The challenge is SAF cost and that is exactly what we are addressing at OXCCU.""

Just 1% of the world’s population is responsible for more than 50% of aviation emissions, highlighting the profound injustice at the heart of the sector’s operations.
But in reality it is ineffectual, with a baseline threshold for ‘acceptable’ emissions set at 85% of the highest-ever level of emissions recorded for international aviation to date.
Clearly a scheme that doesn’t bring all aviation emissions into scope creates unnecessary loopholes for the industry.
And finally, where an emissions price has caused an economic impact in a tourism-dependent country, this can be compensated for through the equitable distribution of the revenues raised by the emissions pricing mechanism.","Emma Fenton is senior director of climate diplomacy at Opportunity Green, an NGO working to unlock the opportunities from tackling climate change using law, economics, and policy.

Last week, the world’s governments came together in Montreal for the triennial assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), just as aviation’s climate impact is coming under sharper scrutiny.

Despite aviation contributing 4% of global heating to date, there are no effective measures to drive emissions reductions – and the industry is expected to keep growing. Passenger traffic is forecast to double over the next two decades, and as a result, the sector is projected to be responsible for as much as 22% of annual global CO2 emissions by 2050.

For too long the aviation industry has held a privileged position in how it accounts for its impacts. Just 1% of the world’s population is responsible for more than 50% of aviation emissions, highlighting the profound injustice at the heart of the sector’s operations.

But without a serious attempt to fairly price – and therefore curb – this sector’s insatiable appetite for fossil fuels, any progress made in decarbonising other sectors will be undone by the aviation industry’s refusal to join the club.

Enter ICAO’s flagship ‘emissions reduction’ scheme CORSIA, which stands for Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. CORSIA may give the industry a prop when it is quizzed on decarbonisation.

But in reality it is ineffectual, with a baseline threshold for ‘acceptable’ emissions set at 85% of the highest-ever level of emissions recorded for international aviation to date. Clearly a scheme that doesn’t bring all aviation emissions into scope creates unnecessary loopholes for the industry.

And all too often we hear the same excuse from the industry – if we were to price aviation emissions, it would create unmanageable economic consequences, particularly for tourism-dependent climate-vulnerable countries. It also cites a lack of fuel availability as a rationale for not taking any decisive action.

But neither of these arguments fly.

Distribution of costs and revenues is key

Latest research by Opportunity Green shows that – while the effect on tourism must unquestionably be a consideration when pricing emissions from aviation – the impacts can be mitigated in how you distribute both the costs and the revenues from your pricing system.

Firstly, those causing the most emissions should pay the greatest share. First-class passengers can be responsible for up to four times the emissions of those in economy seats, so the price of emissions should be borne by those who are causing the most.

Secondly, the pricing mechanism itself can act as a market signal and play a vital role in bringing investment certainty for the development of truly sustainable fuels for aviation. This market signal would help to create the fiscal enabling environment that will unlock private-sector investment to accelerate the uptake of e-fuels (those that are derived from green hydrogen).

And finally, where an emissions price has caused an economic impact in a tourism-dependent country, this can be compensated for through the equitable distribution of the revenues raised by the emissions pricing mechanism. This means that any losses incurred by climate-vulnerable and developing countries can be addressed as a priority.

Climate legal obligations apply to aviation

To make a meaningful step-change in ambition and pace on decarbonisation, we must also see states recognise the growing body of international legal obligations on climate change. Recent opinions from the International Court of Justice, International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, and Inter-American Court of Human Rights all confirm that states have binding obligations to reduce emissions, including from international aviation.

ICAO must align its governance with these legal standards to remain credible.

While hostile moves from the likes of the US and Saudi Arabia have attempted to shake the founding principles of multilateralism, we have also seen states come together in solidarity to push for ambition in tackling climate change.

So far this year, we have seen an historic agreement made at the International Maritime Organisation in April, and a pioneering group of countries agree to implement solidarity levies on luxury aviation, demonstrating how climate action is both morally essential and economically effective.

Coalition set sights on taxing luxury air travel to fund climate action

It was 2022 when ICAO adopted its long-term global aspirational goal for international aviation to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in support of the Paris Agreement’s 1.5C goal. Since then, we have seen no credible action to start moving the sector in the right direction.

Now is the time to confront aviation’s free pass and show how a well-designed emissions price could not only cut emissions but also support the very countries most at risk from climate change.

Unless its member states act in courage, solidarity and with the urgency that is demanded by the climate crisis, ICAO’s long-term goal won’t even make it off the runway.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/09/IMG_6034.jpeg,N,,2025-09-29 13:56:44.196690

Permit revision opens up another public hearing

Northcentral Montana residents, public officials and conservation groups took turns on the mic last week in opposition to a wastewater injection proposal that supports the Montana Renewables biorefinery.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency held a public hearing Sept. 23 in the Conrad High School auditorium. Since 2022, the agency has been reviewing a proposal to inject a maximum of 667 million gallons of industrial wastewater into two inactive oil wells near Lake Frances. The water would come from Montana Renewables’ pretreatment unit, which washes the ag-based materials that the plant makes into renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

Montana Renewables’ environmental assessment estimates that its pretreatment unit will produce as much as 232,000 gallons of wastewater each day once the facility is fully expanded.

Officially, last week’s hearing was about a revision to the underground injection permit. The EPA originally studied an area about a quarter mile in size from the injection zone, which is roughly 3,400 feet underground in the Madison Aquifer. In response to public concerns about how much the injected wastewater could drift over time, the EPA expanded its study area to 2.1 miles and projected that the potential drift of the wastewater would stay within that radius over 10,000 years.

“This is a substantial length of time to allow for dilution and geochemical changes to those injected fluids,” said Fraser Evans, the EPA’s underground injection control permit writer.

Put another way, the EPA’s models suggest that it takes 385 days for groundwater in that region of the aquifer to move one foot, according to Evans.

The majority of public commenters spoke in opposition to the injection of Montana Renewables wastewater beneath Pondera County farmland. They included the three Pondera County commissioners, who have been vocal opponents over the years, as well as the county sanitarian and Conrad Mayor David Cates.

A concern that speakers repeated was that it’s unknown what the area’s water needs will be in decades or even centuries. At some point, that part of the Madison Aquifer might need to be tapped. County Commissioner Zane Drishinski said that at recent meetings of Montana county officials, water is a hot topic.

“And all across Montana, water is the biggest issue, whether it’s too much water or not enough water,” Drishinski said. “And I just don’t see where water is a precious commodity to our leading industry in Montana, which is agriculture, that we can approach this lightly.”

The meeting also featured Roundup Mayor Sandra Jones, whose town just completed a 20-year project to tap the Madison Aquifer for public water. Cascade Mayor Wes Seabolt also spoke at the meeting about the city’s recent project to draw water from the aquifer at a depth of around 2,000 feet.

“Yes we are next to the Missouri River,” Seabolt said. “But for clean water, the Madison [aquifer] is where we get it.”

Patrick Montalban, whose company owns the wells and is requesting the permit from EPA, said last week that geological studies found that the area is stable enough to contain injected wastewater and that past oilfield activity has already contaminated that part of the aquifer. He cautioned against comparisons to other towns who have tapped the Madison and said that while it’s the same aquifer, there are vast differences in quality based on the surrounding geology.

“I’m confident that we will not contaminate any of your drinking water in Pondera County,” Montalban said.

EPA permit documents for the project noted that the injection site, at 3,400 feet below ground, is several thousand feet deeper than current drinking water wells in the area. The documents also noted that the wells have already been used to dispose of oil and gas industry waste, which has been permitted for more than a decade.

Perhaps the most common request from speakers at the hearing was aimed at Montana Renewables. The company, a subsidiary of Calumet, secured a $1.6 billion loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy and is going through a massive biofuel plant expansion. The company has committed to building a wastewater treatment plant on site in Great Falls, which would eliminate the need for underground injection.

Until recently, Montana Renewables hadn’t announced a timeline to construct the treatment plant, meaning the underground injection sites could be used in the meantime. But the company won’t say whether it has firm plans to use the Montalban oil wells for disposal, though it stands to provide a cost savings compared to the current practice of sending wastewater out of state by truck or rail.

“Montana Renewables, make good on your claim,” said Angela Otero, a Valier woman who has filed several public comments about Montana Renewables’ expansion.

On Friday, Montana Renewables spokesperson Lanni Klasner told Montana Free Press that engineering work has begun on the on-site wastewater treatment plant, marking the first step toward building the facility in Great Falls. She said more details would be released soon.

A public comment period remains open through Oct. 13. Permit documents and information about submitting public comments can be found here.

5 Things to Know in Great Falls

Great Falls Park and Recreation cut the ribbon on a new accessible playground at Morony Park last week. The park has features designed for people who use wheelchairs or who have different mobility needs. Interim Park and Recreation Director Jessica Compton said that the equipment is phase one of the park’s development. Future phases will add a pavilion and irrigation for the green spaces. One of the park’s benches, made from recycled plastic, was donated after a city staff campaign to collect plastic waste, Compton said.

On Sept. 18, the Cascade County Sheriff’s Office announced that it put Vaughn School in a shelter-in-place due to a nearby U.S. Customs and Border Patrol operation. A CBP spokesperson told MTFP that agents arrested a person near the Vaughn Conoco gas station at about 10 a.m. that day. The person is suspected of being in the country without documentation. While there are several recent immigration cases in U.S. District Court in Great Falls, none of them yet reference an arrest in Vaughn.

The city of Great Falls is seeking applicants for two Planning Advisory Board seats that will become open at the end of the year. The seven-member board holds initial hearings for matters like annexation, zoning, subdivision, planning roadway improvements and more. Members are appointed by the city commission.

A study reveals India's large potential for sustainable aviation fuel. Financial aid and policies will lower facility building costs. India can produce over 14 million tonnes each year. This volume can meet 70 percent of jet fuel needs by 2050. India may also export fuel to other regions. This will help decarbonize aviation.

ICAO ACT-SAF refers to the International Civil Aviation Organization Assistance, Capacity-building and Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels.

At a low estimate, the study said India can annually produce more than 14 million tonnes of SAF from various feedstocks, with sugarcane bagasse, rice straw, and municipal solid waste forming the bulk of the biogenic feedstocks.

The production quantum can be more than 33 million tonnes per year at the higher end.

Live Events

""The potential low estimate of SAF volumes that can be produced in India is more than sufficient to supply up to 70 per cent SAF blends into all jet fuel used in India (based on jet fuel forecasts to 2050), with additional SAF available for export,"" the study said.

""India can produce more than enough SAF to deliver high blending targets demand and also export SAF to other regions... India's favourable geographic location positions it for export to Southeast Asia and Europe,"" the study said, adding that the country has significant volumes of sustainable feedstocks for producing the fuel.

The production of SAF through the alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) process presents the largest opportunity for India as a route to SAF production, it added.

SAF will be a key element in decarbonisation of the country's fast growing civil aviation space.

While highlighting that the lack of supportive and adequate policies in India makes investment in SAF facilities uneconomical, the study said providing financial assistance in the form of capital grants and loan guarantees can be used to reduce the initial cost of building a first-of-a-kind facility for SAF production, and such an approach will also create a favourable investment environment.

""A combination (basket) of policies with different mechanisms targeting different challenges in the SAF supply chain can spread the higher cost of SAF blending and use.

""Long-term mandates that create a structural demand, combined with long-term, firm offtake agreements (not just a memorandum of understanding), and the establishment of a stable policy framework providing long-term security, will derisk investment and create a favourable investment environment and drive consumption of SAF,"" it noted.

The idea of having mandates for SAF is not being favoured, including by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which is of the view that mandates alone are not adequate and incentives are also needed.

The study has suggested setting up a SAF Council to develop a long-term vision and strategic plan for SAF and integration of SAF within existing biofuels policies to address competition and achieve synergy towards long-term climate goals, among other steps.

Backed by major investors in aviation, energy, and climate investing, the company is positioning itself as a critical force in decarbonizing air travel.

A New Chapter in Aviation Decarbonization

The oversubscribed funding round brought in new investors including Orlen VC, Safran Corporate Ventures, and International Airlines Group (IAG), alongside continued support from Clean Energy Ventures, Aramco Ventures, IP Group/Kiko Ventures, and the University of Oxford.

This fresh capital will allow OXCCU to expand its operations, scale its technology, and advance the next phase of commercialization.

The company recently launched its OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport in 2024, with a second facility, OX2, already in development and expected to be operational by 2026.

Tackling the Cost Barrier for SAF

Despite rising regulatory mandates such as the UK SAF mandate and ReFuelEU, widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuel has been slowed by high production costs.

OXCCU is tackling this barrier head-on with a patented iron-based catalyst that enables direct synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from waste carbon in a single step.

This breakthrough simplifies the production process by eliminating the need for intermediate stages such as reverse water gas shift or e-methanol. The result is:

Lower capital and operating costs

Reduced carbon intensity of fuel

Greater flexibility in feedstocks, including biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure CO₂ with hydrogen

Industry Support and Strategic Partnerships

Global leaders are lining up behind OXCCU’s approach:

International Airlines Group (IAG): Committed to 10% SAF use by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050, IAG views OXCCU’s technology as key to achieving those targets.

Orlen VC: Supporting commercialization as part of its strategy to become one of Europe’s top SAF producers by 2035.

Safran: Investing in OXCCU as part of its broader commitment to advancing decarbonization technologies across aviation.

Clean Energy Ventures and IP Group: Long-time backers who see OXCCU’s progress as proof that UK climate innovation can scale into global solutions.

Why This Matters for the World

Aviation accounts for around 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, and demand for air travel continues to rise. Scaling affordable SAF is one of the most effective levers available to reduce the sector’s climate impact.

By dramatically lowering production costs, OXCCU is helping unlock the path toward widespread adoption of low-carbon fuels.

Beyond aviation, the company’s technology also holds promise for chemicals and plastics, opening new avenues for reducing fossil fuel dependence across industries.

Looking Ahead

CEO Andrew Symes summed up the milestone: “In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving.”

With the backing of strategic investors and rapid progress from lab to demonstration plants, OXCCU is emerging as one of the most promising climate tech companies in the UK.

At a low estimate, the study said India can annually produce more than 14 million tonnes of SAF from various feedstocks, with sugarcane bagasse, rice straw, and municipal solid waste forming the bulk of the biogenic feedstocks.

The production quantum can be more than 33 million tonnes per year at the higher end.

""The potential low estimate of SAF volumes that can be produced in India is more than sufficient to supply up to 70 per cent SAF blends into all jet fuel used in India (based on jet fuel forecasts to 2050), with additional SAF available for export,"" the study said.

""India can produce more than enough SAF to deliver high blending targets demand and also export SAF to other regions... India's favourable geographic location positions it for export to Southeast Asia and Europe,"" the study said, adding that the country has significant volumes of sustainable feedstocks for producing the fuel.

The production of SAF through the alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) process presents the largest opportunity for India as a route to SAF production, it added.

SAF will be a key element in decarbonisation of the country's fast growing civil aviation space.

While highlighting that the lack of supportive and adequate policies in India makes investment in SAF facilities uneconomical, the study said providing financial assistance in the form of capital grants and loan guarantees can be used to reduce the initial cost of building a first-of-a-kind facility for SAF production, and such an approach will also create a favourable investment environment.

""A combination (basket) of policies with different mechanisms targeting different challenges in the SAF supply chain can spread the higher cost of SAF blending and use.

""Long-term mandates that create a structural demand, combined with long-term, firm offtake agreements (not just a memorandum of understanding), and the establishment of a stable policy framework providing long-term security, will derisk investment and create a favourable investment environment and drive consumption of SAF,"" it noted.

The idea of having mandates for SAF is not being favoured, including by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which is of the view that mandates alone are not adequate and incentives are also needed.

Strategic backing from IAG, Safran, Orlen VC, and leading climate investors highlights industry alignment on aviation decarbonisation.

OXCCU’s single-step catalytic process aims to cut production costs, addressing the main barrier to SAF adoption.

Oxford spin-out attracts global capital

OXCCU, a University of Oxford spin-out developing sustainable aviation fuel from waste carbon, has raised $28 million in an oversubscribed Series B round. The financing brings together a mix of airline, aerospace, and energy-sector investors, signalling confidence in the company’s ability to industrialise a cost-effective pathway for low-carbon jet fuel.

Participants include new investors International Airlines Group’s IAGi Ventures, Safran Corporate Ventures, Orlen VC, Hostplus, and TCVC. Existing backers such as Clean Energy Ventures, IP Group’s Kiko Ventures, Aramco Ventures, Eni Next, Braavos Capital, and the University of Oxford also reinvested.

The funding will accelerate OXCCU’s technology scale-up and commercialisation, expanding on its OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport, launched in 2024. A second, larger facility—OX2—is expected to be operational in 2026.

Technology aimed at cost barrier

Aviation accounts for roughly 2–3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and regulators in both the EU and UK are tightening mandates to increase SAF usage. Yet high production costs have prevented wide-scale adoption, with SAF still representing less than 0.2% of global jet fuel supply.

OXCCU’s patented iron-based catalyst bypasses traditional multi-step pathways by directly converting waste carbon gases and hydrogen into jet-range hydrocarbons in a single exothermic reaction. The simplified chemistry reduces both capital and operating costs while maintaining fuel quality standards.

Flexibility in feedstocks—including reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure CO₂ combined with hydrogen—could make the technology deployable across diverse geographies.

“Capital is scarce, but investors recognise the urgency of SAF cost reduction,” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. “We’re proving that distinctive science, delivered at scale, can move aviation towards net zero.”

Investors link climate goals to fuel supply

For IAG, one of Europe’s largest airline groups, the investment supports its target to meet 10% of its fuel needs with SAF by 2030. “Developing next-generation fuels is essential for our net-zero strategy,” said Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at IAG.

Orlen VC described the move as part of its drive to become one of Europe’s leading SAF producers by 2035. “Investing in OXCCU will strengthen our competitiveness as we transform our business toward carbon neutrality,” said Ireneusz Fąfara, President of the Management Board of Orlen.

Safran, the French aerospace manufacturer, tied its investment to risk reduction across the SAF supply chain. “Scaling promising technologies complements our own efforts in engines and equipment,” said Chief Sustainability Officer Nathalie Stubler.

Speed of development draws attention

Venture capital investors point to OXCCU’s rapid trajectory from lab research to pilot and now commercial demonstration. “This company has gone from science to scale in just a few years,” said Daniel Goldman, Co-founder of Clean Energy Ventures. “The potential to produce low-cost jet fuel directly from waste carbon and hydrogen is reshaping the SAF market.”

IP Group’s Cleantech Partner Robert Trezona called the deal a sign of industry credibility. “Significant capital from established actors is now backing a viable route to fully decarbonise aviation,” he said, highlighting the UK’s role in commercialising climate technology.

Beyond aviation

While aviation is the immediate focus, OXCCU notes its platform could extend into chemicals and plastics, diversifying revenue streams and broadening climate impact. Still, executives stress that aviation’s urgent decarbonisation needs remain the priority.

“This is a critical moment for climate technology,” said Symes. “Aviation needs a scalable solution, and SAF is the lever. The challenge is cost—and that is exactly what we are solving.”

Global context

The funding round comes as Europe prepares to implement ReFuelEU requirements mandating airlines to increase SAF blending starting in 2025, and the UK’s SAF mandate is moving toward final legislation. For investors, airlines, and policymakers, technologies that can cut production costs are essential if these targets are to be met.

By securing industrial partners across the aviation value chain, OXCCU positions itself as a potential bridge between regulatory ambition and market reality. Its progress will be closely watched by global investors seeking credible pathways to aviation’s decarbonisation.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OXCCU-Secures-28-Million-to-Scale-Carbon-to-Fuel-Technology-for-Aviation.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 13:57:04.648729

OXFORD, England, Sept. 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- OXCCU, the Oxford University spin-out developing a one-step process to convert waste carbon into SAF, has raised £20.75 million ($28 million) in an oversubscribed Series B funding round. The round includes new investors Orlen VC, Safran Corporate Ventures, International Airlines Group (IAG), Hostplus, and TCVC, alongside continued support from existing backers Clean Energy Ventures, IP Group/Kiko Ventures, Aramco Ventures, Eni Next, Braavos Capital, and the University of Oxford.

This new capital will enable OXCCU to accelerate its commercialisation efforts, expand its operations, and advance its next phase of technology scale-up. It builds on the launch of the company's OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport in 2024. Their second demonstration plant, OX2, is underway and will be fully operational in 2026.

The announcement comes at a time of growing regulatory momentum and market demand for sustainable fuels. However, despite mandates such as the UK SAF mandate and ReFuelEU, high production costs remain a major barrier to widespread adoption.

""In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we're solving,"" said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. ""What we're seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.""

The funding reflects increasing recognition that driving down SAF production costs is critical to unlocking aviation decarbonisation at scale. OXCCU's process simplifies SAF production pathways by eliminating the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps. Instead, its patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction. This reduces capital and operating costs, and reduces the carbon intensity of the fuel.

The catalyst's ability to operate with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen input gas compositions gives it the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks such as reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at International Airlines Group (IAG), said:

""We recognise the need for the world to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably. IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030. Meeting these goals will be supported by this investment into OXCCU which is part of our strategy of developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.""

Ireneusz Fąfara, President of the Management Board of ORLEN, said:

""We invest in the technologies of tomorrow to effectively transform our business. This year, we introduced SAF—sustainable aviation fuel produced from renewable and waste raw materials—into our offering. In line with our strategy, by 2035 we aim to become one of the leading producers of SAF in Europe. Supporting the achievement of this goal is a new investment by ORLEN VC in the technology of OXCCU, a company enabling the conversion of green hydrogen and carbon dioxide into synthetic aviation fuel. Its commercialization will strengthen our market competitiveness and support our pursuit of carbon neutrality.""

Nathalie Stubler, Safran Chief Sustainability Officer comments: ""At Safran, we are committed to advancing the decarbonization of aviation. In addition to the development of new technologies in our own products such as engines and aircraft equipment, we are also supporting the de-risking and industrial scale-up of the most promising sustainable aviation fuel technologies.""

Daniel Goldman, Managing Partner and Co-founder of Clean Energy Ventures, said: ""OXCCU stands out not only for its differentiated technology but also for the speed of its progress toward commercial plants. In just a few years, the company has advanced from the lab to a commercial demonstration facility, proving that waste carbon and hydrogen can be converted directly into jet fuel at low cost. That rapid progress is reshaping the sustainable aviation fuel market, unlocking the affordability aviation needs to decarbonize. With the extraordinary leadership team and support of its strategic investors, we are confident OXCCU will lead the decarbonization of fuels and chemicals in the coming years.""

Dr Robert Trezona, Partner, Cleantech at IP Group, said: ""This round is a significant milestone, not just for the Company, but for the sector – significant capital being put to work from established industry actors on a credible path to fully decarbonise aviation. OXCCU showcases the UK's ability to lead in climate innovation, turning world-class science into global solutions, while generating jobs and lasting impact. We're proud to continue to support the company as it scales its compelling single-step technology.""

OXCCU's solution meets both environmental and commercial demands, with applications that extend beyond aviation into chemicals and plastics.

,,2025-09-29 14:00:04+00:00,ABC News,Some air travelers bothered by their flight's emissions turn to carbon offsets. Do they work?,"CALEIGH WELLS Associated Press, ABC News",,,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/air-travelers-bothered-flights-emissions-turn-carbon-offsets-126036997,"Or, maybe you're an environmentally minded person, and you've heard you can buy these things called carbon offsets.
It's connected to something that stores or reduces carbon emissions — for example, planting trees, or funding renewable energy.
The idea is that the program or action offsets your pollutive action.
Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, has studied carbon offsets for more than 20 years.
Instead of buying carbon offsets, Haya said she donates $1,000 to an organization she cares about on the rare occasion she flies for work or family visits.","So you're booking your flight, and just when you're about to check out, the airline asks if you'd like to pay a little something to offset your share of the flight's pollution. Or, maybe you're an environmentally minded person, and you've heard you can buy these things called carbon offsets.

Are they worth it? Let's explore.

A roundtrip flight from New York to Los Angeles emits more than 1,300 pounds (about 614 kilograms) of planet-warming carbon dioxide per passenger, according to an emissions calculator from the International Civil Aviation Organization. That's about the amount of pollution you'd save if you swore off meat for 17 months.

Jet engines burn fossil fuels, releasing planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. They also release water vapor, which turns into long, thin clouds called contrails that trap heat instead of letting it escape to space — additional warming that isn't typically included in a flight's emissions, said Diane Vitry, aviation director at a clean energy advocacy organization called the European Federation for Transport and Environment.

Reducing emissions from air travel is difficult. Batteries weigh too much and provide too little power for long flights. Sustainable aviation fuel — biofuels made from things like corn, oil seeds and algae that can be mixed with jet fuel — is currently more expensive than traditional fuel and lacking sufficient supply to be in wide use.

“Aviation is the problem child,” Vitry said. “Aviation and shipping are not decarbonizing, and definitely not fast enough.”

That's where carbon offsets come in.

A carbon offset is a certificate or a permit to emit planet-warming gases. It's connected to something that stores or reduces carbon emissions — for example, planting trees, or funding renewable energy.

The idea is that the program or action offsets your pollutive action. You drive a car that pollutes a certain amount, you buy a carbon offset that leads to the planting of a tree that sequesters the same amount, and bam: the pollutive action (driving) is offset (tree planting).

They've gotten popular enough that there's an entire marketplace that connects people and companies wanting to reduce their impacts with other companies that promise to do so.

Vitry doesn't think so. She calls them a fake climate solution.

“Unfortunately, it is not what is going to solve aviation’s climate problem,” she said. “You can’t clear your climate conscience with an offset.”

Sure, you can plant a tree, but Vitry said that doesn’t stop your flight's emissions from entering the atmosphere. The tree may eventually absorb an equivalent amount of emissions. Or it may die. Or it may be sold as an offset multiple times by an unscrupulous company, meaning the tree can't possible absorb all the emissions it's supposed to.

Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, has studied carbon offsets for more than 20 years. She said some offset schemes are overcounted by 10 to 13 times their actual value.

“There’s so much over-crediting on the offset market, so many credits that either don’t represent any emissions reductions at all or represent just a small fraction of what they claim,” Haya said.

She said that’s partly because the voluntary offset market is largely unregulated, and it’s really difficult to measure offsets. The other problem is everyone involved benefits from over-exaggerating the benefits of offsets. “The buyer of the credit wants the cheap credits, the seller of the credits wants to get more credits for the same activity and the third party verifier is hired by the project developer, so has a conflict of interest to be lenient,” Haya said.

Jodi Manning, chief executive of the carbon offset nonprofit Cool Effect, said consumers should beware of offset programs that don't say clearly which project will benefit from your purchase or how much of your money is going to a project. But she said “high-quality” carbon credits can play an important role where emissions are unavoidable.

Manning said offsets have to be permanent, transparent, and unable to exist without the offset funding.

“When carbon is done correctly, it can provide a credible, immediate way to account for the emissions that travelers cannot otherwise reduce. We all create emissions at some point and it is certainly better to take action to compensate for it than to do nothing,” she said.

Several airlines that offer offsets did not respond to requests from AP to talk about their use. One that did, Southwest Airlines, said in a statement that it does not plan to rely on carbon offsets to help it reach a goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

Fly less, take the train if you can, and pack light, Manning said.

If you have to fly, think about cutting your emissions in other ways, Haya said.

Instead of buying carbon offsets, Haya said she donates $1,000 to an organization she cares about on the rare occasion she flies for work or family visits.

""We have an ethical obligation not to fly unless we really have to,"" she said.

From sustainable fuels to strategic aircraft ownership and Africa’s fast-growing aviation markets, the report offers unmatched insight for industry leaders, investors, and policymakers.

A Sector in Transition

The aviation industry is navigating a period of profound change. Once defined by cycles of boom and bust, business and private aviation are now adapting to new realities: sustainability pressures, evolving regulations, cyber risk, and shifting global demand. The CEO Insight Aviation Report examines these dynamics, providing readers with a forward-looking perspective on how companies, registries, and operators can thrive in this environment.

“The future of aviation will be shaped less by exuberance and more by discipline,” writes James Martin in Risk, Responsibility and the Next Leg of Growth. He highlights how fleet management, cyber security, and financial resilience must be treated as integrated disciplines in order to maintain profitability and predictability in the next phase of growth.

Key Themes and Features

The report brings together contributions from leading journalists, experts, and industry stakeholders, addressing the challenges and opportunities that define aviation today:

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): In The Jet Fuel Disruptor, examines whether SAF can realistically clean up aviation. With production volumes still below 1% of global demand, scaling remains the industry’s greatest challenge—but with mandates in Europe and the US, SAF is set to become a cornerstone of aviation’s climate strategy.

Aircraft Ownership and Structuring: Navigating Aircraft Ownership underscores why smart structuring is essential. From selecting the right jurisdiction to balancing tax efficiency and asset protection, ownership decisions now carry strategic weight for corporates and family offices.

The Isle of Man Aircraft Registry: In an exclusive interview, Director Simon Williams outlines how the Registry is preparing for its “next chapter.” Under the motto Safety with Service, the Registry is advancing digital innovation, responding to international sanctions, and reinforcing its position as the registry of choice for private and corporate operators worldwide.

Africa’s Business Aviation Boom: Africa’s Runway explores why business aviation is becoming indispensable across the continent. In regions where road and rail networks remain underdeveloped, private aviation is no longer a luxury but an economic necessity driving investment and connectivity.

Transatlantic Business Travel: highlights how U.S. preclearance facilities, airport hubs, and new service standards are redefining the business travel experience. As executives demand greater speed, discretion, and connectivity, airports are transforming from transit points into strategic assets.

Global Relevance

The Aviation Report demonstrates how aviation is simultaneously a global industry and a highly regional one. While North America remains the gravitational centre of business aviation, Europe faces capacity and regulatory constraints, the Middle East is rapidly expanding, and Africa represents one of the most dynamic growth stories. Each region’s distinct trajectory is covered in depth, providing readers with a nuanced understanding of market opportunities.

The Future of Flight

Across the report, one theme stands out: aviation is no longer only about moving people—it is about managing complexity. Aircraft are strategic assets that demand careful structuring, environmental accountability, and operational resilience. For investors, family offices, and governments, the ability to navigate this complexity will define success.

The funding round was oversubscribed, according to a company statement released Monday.

The new capital will be used to expand operations and advance the next phase of technology scale-up, including the development of a second demonstration plant, OX2, which the company expects to be fully operational in 2026. This builds on the launch of its OX1 demonstration plant earlier in 2024 at London Oxford Airport.

New investors in the round include Orlen VC, Safran Corporate Ventures, International Airlines Group (IAG), Hostplus, and TCVC. Existing investors such as Clean Energy Ventures, IP Group/Kiko Ventures, Aramco Ventures, and Eni Next also participated.

The company states this approach simplifies the production pathway by eliminating steps often required in SAF production, which it expects will reduce capital and operating costs.

The investment highlights increasing market recognition that high production costs remain a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of SAF, despite global mandates such as ReFuelEU and the UK SAF mandate. SAF is considered a critical lever for decarbonizing the aviation sector.

Andrew Symes, chief executive officer of OXCCU, stated that the successful raise in a tightening market was ""a testament to the strength of our science"" and the urgency of the problem.

For investors like IAG, the move aligns with existing environmental targets. Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at IAG, noted the investment is part of the airline group’s strategy to meet its goal of sourcing 10% of its fuel needs with SAF by 2030.

Similarly, Ireneusz F?fara, president of the Management Board of ORLEN, said the investment supports the company’s strategic aim to become one of Europe's leading SAF producers by 2035.

The company reports that its catalyst is designed to work with various feedstock compositions, including reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

Today, this role is more critical than ever, extending beyond traditional financial stewardship to driving digital transformation and strategic decision-making.

The era of focusing solely on numbers is over. CFOs must now adapt to rapid technological change, embed AI into finance operations, and lead transformation initiatives—while many organizations are still preparing for this shift.

The results of the survey were presented by Rob Steensels, Head of CFO Advisory at KPMG in Belgium, who explained how the CFO’s role is shifting toward becoming a strategic co-pilot in driving business performance. Based on insights from 157 Belgium-based CFOs, including 25% from BEL20 companies, several key trends emerged: more than half of CFOs now oversee ESG reporting, and 62% prioritize process standardization and technology transformation, with significant investments planned in ERP upgrades and integration.

Despite this progress, challenges remain—outdated IT landscapes, fragmented data systems, resistance to change, and a shortage of talent with combined finance and technology expertise. Notably, 66% of CFOs report difficulty finding the right skills, and many organizations are still in the early stages of AI adoption, primarily through robotic process automation (RPA).

AI is a game changer, enabling real-time insights, predictive analytics, and operational efficiency. To seize these opportunities, CFOs must redefine operating models, align IT and finance strategies, and invest in upskilling. Compliance with emerging regulations, such as the AI Act, and embedding robust controls are also critical.

The panel discussion highlighted how the CFO role is evolving—expanding beyond finance to include strategy, IT, and ESG. Finance leaders are embracing change and redefining value, moving from transactional responsibilities to strategic leadership. By leveraging data-driven insights, CFOs are now guiding decision-making and driving sustainable value.

CFOs shared the following perspectives during the discussion:

Els de Keukelaere of ABO Group highlighted challenges in AI integration due to fragmented information and emphasized a gradual approach to adoption.

Jean-Philippe Michaux of Puratos shared the importance of focusing on centralizing IT systems for efficiency and security, leveraging SAP transitions to drive process transformation.

Davy Vreys of Brussels Airport Company positioned sustainability as a strategic priority, targeting net-zero carbon by 2030 through investments in sustainable aviation fuel, electric propulsion, and diversification into real estate and drone services.

Karel Tanghe of AG Insurance stressed the importance of cultural change, leadership, and initiatives to improve employee well-being and reduce workload.

Geert Peeters of Ontex addressed geopolitical and market volatility, emphasizing flexible planning and cost management.

AI adoption remains uneven: some companies use advanced AI for data reconciliation and fraud detection, while others view it as immature for core systems due to cybersecurity concerns. CFOs are prioritizing digital transformation projects such as SAP S/4HANA implementation and agile finance processes, including rolling forecasts and predictive analytics.

Sustainability continues to be integral, with companies embedding ESG into their core strategies while balancing regulatory requirements. Workforce evolution is also a key theme, with a shift from mechanical tasks to roles requiring analytical expertise.

The panel concluded with a clear message: invest in talent, culture, and continuous innovation to embrace rapid technological change and maintain a competitive edge.",https://assets.kpmg.com/is/image/kpmg/CFO-SurveyEventKeyTakeaway-2025-EN-banner-0461-1500x1000-05:cq5dam.web.1200.600,N,,2025-09-29 11:57:47.102871

As part of its growing sustainability efforts, Hecksher is implementing a new way for companies to address the climate impact of air freight: Sustainable Aviation Fuel certificates (SAFc).

SAFc is an established market-based mechanism decoupling the environmental attribute of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from the physical product through a ‘book and claim’ system and has become an important tool to reduce the environmental impact of essential business travel and air freight.

SAF is made from certified sustainable feedstocks, such as used cooking oil and other residual waste materials.

It has emerged as a trusted solution to decarbonize the aviation industry as it can reduce life cycle CO2e emissions by up to 80%, according to IATA.

Niklas Olsson, Group CEO, Hecksher says: “We’ve already taken significant steps to reduce emissions in sea freight. Purchasing SAFc for air freight supports the replacement of fossil kerosene and offers a readily implementable, transparent and scalable solution for corporates looking to address their Scope 3 emissions without having to change carriers, routes or operational setup.”

How it works

Hecksher calculates the customer’s air freight emissions

The customer selects a SAFc amount – matching all or part of their emissions

The SAFc represents a volume of physical SAF used to replace kerosene in commercial operations. Via book & claim Hecksher owns the exclusive rights to the end-user emission reduction, which is recorded on the SAFc registry

The SAFc registry publicly records all claimed emission reductions and only allows the issuance of SAFc where the physical SAF meets stringent quality controls such as third –party verification, therefore assuring full transparency and avoiding double issuance/ claiming

The customer receives a digital certificate that includes all the characteristics of the SAFc supporting the environmental claim

Patrik Westraeus, Head of Sustainability at Greencarrier Group, which includes Hecksher says: “We have found a cost-effective solution that allows us to offer SAF at purchase price.

“This means our customers can buy SAF at a lower cost compared to several other providers.”

Delivered in partnership with STX Group

The SAFc initiative is delivered in partnership with environmental commodities trader STX Group.

Fabian Roobeek, Managing Partner at STX Group says: “We congratulate Hecksher and Greencarrier on taking this important step by implementing SAFc.

“It’s encouraging to see the shift toward renewable fuels, and at STX we are proud to support such pioneers by providing market access and liquidity in SAFc”.",https://caasint.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2025/09/Hecksher-launches-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-Certificates-SAFc-for-air-freight.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 08:56:29.196404

The pair participated in the inaugural Flinchbaugh Forum at Kansas State University to honor Dr. Barry Flinchbaugh, a flamboyant agricultural economist known for his cigars and blunt speaking style.
The Barry Flinchbaugh Center for Ag and Food Policy was created to bring together policy and economic discussions around agriculture and rural America.
They called on current Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to consider putting together a commission that would look at a new direction for agriculture going into the next 20 years.
Back to Freedom to Farm, Torrey recalled how Flinchbaugh came out to Washington to talk to policy leaders trying to negotiate the bill.","MANHATTAN, Kan. (DTN) -- Former Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns voiced his concerns Sept. 26 about the soybean market, competition with Brazil and the need to continue building out the biofuels industry to support domestic markets.

""I feel very, very strongly that if you're going to have this kind of trade policy, you absolutely have to build a market and you get, you have to, you've got to get 1-million percent on board with doing everything you can to expand this biofuels industry,"" Johanns said.

Johanns led USDA from 2005 to 2007 under the George W. Bush administration when the ethanol industry was aggressively expanding under the Renewable Fuel Standard. Johanns said a similar injection of domestic investment is needed for the soybean industry with the development of sustainable aviation fuel.

The former secretary noted that 20 years ago, the U.S. didn't have the same international competition that the country now faces because of South America. He pointed to the fact China has yet to make any purchases of 2025-26 U.S. soybeans.

""I probably worry most about the soybean piece of our ag production, just because Brazil is not going away. They're going to keep building,"" Johanns said. He added, ""What does that tell me? Man, if I was in the secretary's office now, I'd be pounding the table to build out biofuels. Really, really focusing some real attention on aviation fuels.""

INAUGURAL FLINCHBAUGH FORUM

Johanns spoke on a panel with fellow former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, a Kansas native. The pair participated in the inaugural Flinchbaugh Forum at Kansas State University to honor Dr. Barry Flinchbaugh, a flamboyant agricultural economist known for his cigars and blunt speaking style.

""I've had a wheelbarrow full of manure delivered to my office front door and I've been burned in effigy,"" Flinchbaugh once said to describe his popularity.

Flinchbaugh, who passed away in 2020, had been an adviser to secretaries of Agriculture and leaders on the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. He had worked on farm bills going back to 1968 and had served at Kansas State University since 1971, where he had taught agricultural policy to approximately 4,100 students during that time.

The Barry Flinchbaugh Center for Ag and Food Policy was created to bring together policy and economic discussions around agriculture and rural America.

Glickman said Flinchbaugh was a driving force behind support for the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act, a farm bill that attempted to reduce the reliance of farmers on farm programs. Then-President Bill Clinton was leery about signing that version of the farm bill, but Glickman consulted with Flinchbaugh on the legislation.

""He had great influence on me and people in the academic world,"" Glickman said.

AGRICULTURE AT CROSSROADS

Johanns and Glickman each noted agriculture is at a crossroads because of trade and Brazilian competition. They called on current Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to consider putting together a commission that would look at a new direction for agriculture going into the next 20 years.

""Go out there and lead this effort and talks about what we want agriculture to look like in 20 years or 25 years,"" Johanns said. ""How are we going to compete? What brings a new day for agriculture? How do we keep people on the farm and on the range?""

Glickman noted Flinchbaugh had advocated for a commission that would basically look at long-term challenges. One of the problems now among policymakers is that ""everything is very short-term now,"" Glickman said.

FLINCHBAUGH'S LEGACY

The forum just off the Kansas State University campus included alumni from around the country who shared stories of humor and policy over Flinchbaugh's four decades at the university. A crop of current leaders explained how Flinchbaugh could communicate complicated issues simply.

""Dr. Barry Flinchbaugh had a profound influence on shaping ag policy at every level of government and influenced the lives of countless leaders in the industry,"" said Brad Lubben, an agricultural policy professor at the University of Nebraska and former student of Flinchbaugh.

Michael Torrey, who now leads Torrey Advisory Group in Washington, D.C., said he got to know Flinchbaugh by going into his office as a student and disagreeing with him. Flinchbaugh once told him, ""I should have given you an 'F.'"" Back to Freedom to Farm, Torrey recalled how Flinchbaugh came out to Washington to talk to policy leaders trying to negotiate the bill.

""He came out there, and he was able to help educate and to teach,"" Torrey said.

Another former student, Gregg Doud, president and CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation, credited Flinchbaugh as the godfather of the farm safety net. Flinchbaugh, though, also cautioned that the relationship between farmers and the government comes with strings attached.

Quoting Flinchbaugh, Doud said, ""Always remember, when you get in bed with the government, you get more than a good night's kiss.""

Scott Cutshall, president of real estate and sustainability at Clay Lacy Aviation, says the company’s environmental focus began at an industry trade show.
Socially, the company invests in developing its employees’ careers, supporting local communities, and bringing new talent into business aviation.
One of the challenges Clay Lacy faced was how to measure environmental progress while experiencing significant business growth.
“For our clients, we wanted to offer solutions that, if they wanted to, they could reduce their emissions,” Cutshall explains.","Since launching its first sustainability program in 2019, Clay Lacy Aviation has made remarkable strides in reducing its environmental footprint while continuing to grow its business operations across the USA.

Founded in 1968, Clay Lacy Aviation operates across four business lines — aircraft management, charter services, maintenance and repair, and fixed base operator services. The company has private jet terminals in Los Angeles, Orange County, and Connecticut.

Scott Cutshall, president of real estate and sustainability at Clay Lacy Aviation, says the company’s environmental focus began at an industry trade show. “I was walking around NBAA-BACE, and in the corner of a fuel booth, they had a vendor talking about sustainable aviation fuel and I got talking to them. That was my first exposure to the topic of sustainability and what was possible in the industry.”

This encounter led to the development of a comprehensive sustainability program built around three core motivations.

“We have three whys,” Cutshall explains. “The first one is we wanted to prepare for the future.

We felt that there would be regulation coming around environmental emissions. The second is we wanted to create a competitive advantage — we wanted to be ahead and be a leader in this area. And then the third is, we just feel it’s the right thing to do.

“If we can start to modify some of our actions today to reduce consumption of natural resources, to reduce unnecessary emissions, why wouldn’t we want to do that?” he says.

A triple bottom line

Clay Lacy’s sustainability strategy follows what Cutshall describes as a triple bottom line approach, balancing social, economic, and environmental considerations.

“There’s a social element, an economic element, and an environmental element, and we hold those three in tension with each other,” he says. “There’s a lot of things we could do to be more environmentally friendly, but they would harm the business from an economic standpoint. So, there’s a healthy tension there.”

This balanced approach extends to all facets of the company’s operations. For the environmental component, Clay Lacy focuses on reducing facility emissions and resource consumption. Socially, the company invests in developing its employees’ careers, supporting local communities, and bringing new talent into business aviation. Economically, initiatives must make business sense to ensure the company’s long-term viability.

One of the challenges Clay Lacy faced was how to measure environmental progress while experiencing significant business growth. The company developed innovative metrics to account for expansion.

“We’re a growing organization. In 2019, we were at around 80 airplanes; today, we’re at 160 airplanes that we manage,” Cutshall notes. “So how do you measure if you are reducing your environmental and carbon footprint, if you’re a growing organization?”

The company’s solution was to divide total emissions by three metrics, the square footage of facilities, the number of employees, and the number of managed aircraft. This approach allows the company to track efficiency improvements even as its overall operations expand.

The results have been impressive. Cutshall says, “Our facilities have grown by 51% while emissions per square foot have decreased by 26%. Employee count has grown by 145% where emissions per employee has dropped 54%.”

Client-focused solutions

An important distinction in Clay Lacy’s sustainability approach is how they handle aircraft emissions. As Cutshall points out, “We don’t own any aircraft. We manage them on behalf of individuals and corporations. So technically, the emissions from the planes are not Clay Lacy’s emissions, because we don’t decide when they fly.”

Instead of attempting to control these scope 3 emissions, Clay Lacy focuses on providing options to clients who want to reduce their environmental impact.

“For our clients, we wanted to offer solutions that, if they wanted to, they could reduce their emissions,” Cutshall explains.

“We started with a carbon offset program. When we started, we were one of the first 10 FBOs in the US to start selling a continuous supply of SAF,” he adds. “But it was optional to buy. And then we started generating complimentary emission reports for our aircraft owners.”

This approach extends to charter clients as well. “If a charter client would like an emissions report for all their charters for the year or the quarter, we can now generate that for them.”

Clay Lacy has implemented numerous sustainability measures throughout its operations. “We’ve installed solar panels on our facilities. We’ve transitioned all our ground service equipment to either renewable diesel or electric,” Cutshall says. While the transition to renewable diesel initially presented cost challenges, the company took a patient approach. “At first it was about US$1 more per gallon, which wasn’t financially feasible. So, we just monitored it, and it took about another year and a half for the price to come into about 10 cents.”

Other notable achievements include eliminating 227,280 plastic water bottles since November 2022, diverting thousands of pounds of rubbish from landfills through recycling and composting, sourcing one-third of all electricity from renewable sources, processing 40,000 pounds of e-recycling between 2019-2022, and providing EV charging at their Van Nuys facility, delivering 15,414 kWh of charging (equivalent to 6.7 metric tons of CO2 or 750 gallons of gasoline).

For aviation businesses starting their sustainability programs, Cutshall recommends measuring emissions first. “Step on the scale, find out what your scope one and scope two emissions are,” he says. “And then start to make a plan to do something. It doesn’t have to be everything. Just do something to start moving down that path.”

He advocates for widespread incremental action over comprehensive programs by a few companies. “I firmly believe that it’s about more organizations doing something, than a few organizations doing a lot. Because if every organization just did a little bit, the impact would actually be much larger.”

Business aviation’s small size creates networking opportunities, Cutshall notes. “Business aviation is not a big industry. Reach out for help. Chances are, everybody knows somebody that’s a bit ahead of them in the sustainability journey. Go ask them ‘How did you start? What worked for you? What didn’t work for you?’”

The company’s approach reflects a long-term commitment to environmental progress. “To be sustainable, you don’t get somewhere and say, ‘Okay, now I’m sustainable.’ It’s a never-ending journey.”",https://s44876.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2023-Scott-Cutshall-LR-Headshot-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 08:56:44.086383

This approach allows assigning biomass materials to produce stretch films with quality equivalent to those made from 100% petroleum-based raw materials.
The new stretch film incorporates polyethene with 100% biomass content assigned through the mass balance method, blended at approximately 25% biomass-based plastic.
At Narita Airport, JAL Cargo Service and JAL Cargo Handling have verified that handling quality equivalent to the conventional standard can be ensured, and have decided to proceed with the implementation.","Starting in October 2025, JAL will sequentially introduce cargo stretch films made from biomass materials using the mass balance method at domestic airports. This marks the first initiative within Japan’s aviation industry.

Compared to conventional methods, the mass balance method reduces concerns about raw material shortages and requires no large-scale capital investment. Additionally, this method achieves physical properties equivalent to those of conventional petroleum-based products. JAL expects to reduce CO₂ emissions by approximately 50 tons annually with the use of these films.

According to the JAL Group Medium-Term Management Plan (Rolling Plan 2025), efforts are underway to reduce single-use plastics derived from fossil fuels. The cargo division actively promotes the use of materials containing eco-friendly components, aiming for efficient use of limited resources and reduced environmental impact. With the introduction of these new stretch films, 100% incorporation of eco-friendly materials in cargo handling supplies will be achieved as planned.

About the mass balance method and the new stretch film

The mass balance approach is a method used during product processing and manufacturing where multiple raw materials are blended, and the characteristics of each material are properly allocated to the final product according to their blended proportions. This approach allows assigning biomass materials to produce stretch films with quality equivalent to those made from 100% petroleum-based raw materials. Furthermore, the biomass materials incorporated in the stretch films are derived from biomass naphtha—a byproduct obtained during the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—thereby maximising the effective use of limited resources.

The new stretch film incorporates polyethene with 100% biomass content assigned through the mass balance method, blended at approximately 25% biomass-based plastic. At Narita Airport, JAL Cargo Service and JAL Cargo Handling have verified that handling quality equivalent to the conventional standard can be ensured, and have decided to proceed with the implementation.

SAF is made from certified sustainable feedstocks, such as used cooking oil and other residual waste materials. The fuel has emerged as a trusted solution to decarbonise the aviation industry as it can reduce life cycle CO2e emissions by up to 80 percent, according to IATA.

”We’ve already taken significant steps to reduce emissions in seafreight. Purchasing SAFc for airfreight supports the replacement of fossil kerosene and offers a readily implementable, transparent and scalable solution for corporates looking to address their Scope 3 emissions without having to change carriers, routes or operational setup.”, says Niklas Olsson, Group CEO, Hecksher

How it works

Hecksher calculates the customer’s airfreight emissions

The customer selects a SAFc amount – matching all or part of their emissions

The SAFc represents a volume of physical SAF used to replace kerosene in commercial operations. Via book & claim Hecksher owns the exclusive rights to the end-user emission reduction, which is recorded on the SAFc registry

The SAFc registry publicly records all claimed emission reductions and only allows the issuance of SAFc where the physical SAF meets stringent quality controls such as third -party verification, therefore assuring full transparency and avoiding double issuance/ claiming

Customer receives a digital certificate that includes all the characteristics of the SAFc supporting the environmental claim.

“We have found a cost-effective solution that allows us to offer SAF at purchase price. This means our customers can buy SAF at a lower cost compared to several other providers,” says Patrik Westraeus, Head of Sustainability at Greencarrier Group, which includes Hecksher.

Delivered in partnership with STX Group

The SAFc initiative is delivered in partnership with environmental commodities trader STX Group.

“We congratulate Hecksher and Greencarrier on taking this important step by implementing SAFc. It’s encouraging to see the shift toward renewable fuels, and at STX we are proud to support such pioneers by providing market access and liquidity in SAFc,” says Fabian Roobeek, Managing Partner at STX Group.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hecksher-flygbraIˆnsle-photo-press--1080x632.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 07:56:52.304835

The airport submitted an original planning application in 2023 seeking to increase total annual flights from 50,000 to 70,000 and non-weekday flights from 8,900 to 18,900. The revised application proposes increasing non-weekday flights to 13,500 annually while keeping the overall 50,000 flight limit unchanged.

The revised application retains existing restrictions on heavier aircraft, including an 80-tonne maximum weight limit and no more than 1,500 annual flights for aircraft weighing 50-80 tonnes. Non-weekday flights for heavier aircraft would increase from 270 to 405 annually, proportionate to the overall non-weekday flight increase.

According to Farnborough Airport, the application proposes removing aircraft weighing 50-55 tonnes that meet stringent noise standards from restricted weight category quotas. The change supports introduction of modern aircraft with improved environmental performance compared to older, lighter aircraft.

Simon Geere, chief executive of Farnborough Airport, said the revised application addresses medium-term growth without compromising long-term planning. “Supporting the long-term demand for flights from Farnborough Airport is essential if we are to maintain our role as one of the principle economic generators in the region,” Geere said. “The airport supports over 3,000 local jobs and is the UK’s largest business aviation gateway serving London and the South East.”

The revised application does not include changes to operating hours, which run from 08:00 to 20:00 on non-weekdays. The original application proposed extending hours from 07:00 to 21:00, but this was removed following consultation feedback.

Farnborough Airport has opened public consultation on the revised application until October 22. The airport will host two online webinars during the consultation period for community questions and feedback.

According to the airport, approximately 80% of flights are business-related, contributing £1.6 billion in gross value added to the UK economy annually. The facility supports 3,100 local jobs across hundreds of businesses in the region.

Farnborough Airport has committed to achieving net-zero emissions for operations under its control by 2030.

The round includes new investors Orlen VC, Safran Corporate Ventures, International Airlines Group (IAG), Hostplus, and TCVC, alongside continued support from existing backers Clean Energy Ventures, IP Group/Kiko Ventures, Aramco Ventures, Eni Next, Braavos Capital, and the University of Oxford.

“In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving,” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. “What we’re seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.”

OXCCU’s Series B is one of the larger deals in the European clean fuels/carbon conversion space to date in 2025, relative to the mid-single digit millions more typical of earlier-stage players. While many of the comparators remain at pre-Seed or Seed scale (e.g. the €2.3 million for Spark e-Fuels, or the €3.2 million for Crosstown), OXCCU is advancing into commercialisation and demonstration scale.

Its raise reflects investor appetite for more mature, de-risked technologies in the carbon-to-liquids/SAF domain, particularly where there is a credible pathway to cost reduction and industrial deployment.

Notably, Catalyxx in Spain is operating in a somewhat related niche (converting bioethanol into renewable chemicals/SAF intermediates), so there is a similar echo of interest in Southern Europe. But none of the comparators identified in 2025 reach quite the same scale or share exactly the same one-step carbon to hydrocarbon approach.

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at International Airlines Group (IAG), said: “We recognise the need for the world to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably. IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030. Meeting these goals will be supported by this investment into OXCCU which is part of our strategy of developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.”

Founded in 2021, OXCCU is developing novel catalysts and reactor designs to convert waste carbon into liquid hydrocarbons with high conversion and selectivity for use as fuels and chemicals.

The new capital builds on the launch of the company’s OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport in 2024. Their second demonstration plant, OX2, is underway and will be fully operational in 2026.

The announcement comes at a time of growing regulatory momentum and market demand for sustainable fuels. However, despite mandates such as the UK SAF mandate and ReFuelEU, the company says high production costs remain a major barrier to widespread adoption.

Ireneusz Fąfara, President of the Management Board of ORLEN, added: “We invest in the technologies of tomorrow to effectively transform our business. This year, we introduced SAF – sustainable aviation fuel produced from renewable and waste raw materials – into our offering. In line with our strategy, by 2035 we aim to become one of the leading producers of SAF in Europe.

“Supporting the achievement of this goal is a new investment by ORLEN VC in the technology of OXCCU, a company enabling the conversion of green hydrogen and carbon dioxide into synthetic aviation fuel. Its commercialisation will strengthen our market competitiveness and support our pursuit of carbon neutrality.”

The funding reflects increasing recognition that driving down SAF production costs is critical to unlocking aviation decarbonisation at scale.

OXCCU’s process simplifies SAF production pathways by eliminating the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps. Instead, its patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction.

This reportedly reduces capital and operating costs, and reduces the carbon intensity of the fuel.

The catalyst’s ability to operate with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen input gas compositions gives it the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks such as reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

“This is a critical time for ClimateTech, as the urgency continues to increase,” added Symes. “Aviation needs a solution, and the serious lever is SAF. The challenge is SAF cost and that is exactly what we are addressing at OXCCU.”",https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OXCCU.png,N,,2025-09-29 07:57:35.828199

After a week of frying frites, the kitchen at Washington’s famous standby for French cuisine was full to bursting with used grease.

Two waist-high storage tanks in the back of the restaurant sloshed to the brim with dark, viscous oil. During the weekend rush, the staff stored some of the spent grease in plastic tubs, but they were quickly running out of places to put it.

Restaurants are prohibited from dumping grease down the drain because it would clog city sewers. So on a Tuesday afternoon, James Howell nimbly backed his truck into an alley behind Le Diplomate. He hopped down from the cab and snaked a rubber hose to the kitchen. Then with the flip of a switch and a loud drone, the hose slurped the used cooking oil into the truck’s gleaming steel 2,200-gallon tank.

The spent grease that restaurants unload as waste has become a valuable commodity. If you’ve been on a plane lately, there’s a chance that used cooking oil has helped launch you into the sky. Refineries recycle waste oil into kerosene pure enough to power a Boeing 777. The process is expensive — but it can create 70 to 80 percent less planet-warming pollution than making jet fuel out of crude oil, experts say.

Last year, airlines burned 340 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — nearly all of it made from used cooking oil or animal fat leftover from meat packaging.

That’s a drop in the bucket compared to the 114 billion gallons of fuel airlines burned overall, which create 2.5 percent of humanity’s carbon pollution, according to the International Energy Agency. But airlines have vowed to use much more SAF to lower their greenhouse emissions. European regulators have set strict rules requiring airlines to use more SAF over time, while U.S. regulators dole out tax credits to coax companies into buying it.

This is the airlines’ main plan for dealing with their greenhouse emissions. Upgrading new planes with more efficient engines helps a little. And, one day, planes may run on electric batteries or hydrogen fuel cells — but those are still decades away and may never work for long flights. To manage most of their climate impact for the foreseeable future, airlines are betting everything on alternative fuels.

“Ninety-eight percent of [our greenhouse emissions] come from the fuel we burn,” said Lauren Riley, chief sustainability officer at United Airlines. “We’ll continue to look everywhere we can around technology and innovation of the aircraft itself and the engine, but we have to look at replacing our fuel.”

Experts say this plan can work, but it’ll require fuel refiners to dramatically raise SAF production and find new raw materials besides old cooking oil to turn into kerosene. Depending on what they use and how they refine it, this new class of fuel could make flying more sustainable or cause a whole new set of environmental headaches.

Harvesting the world’s grease

On his rounds one day in early May, Howell made about two dozen stops at commercial kitchens around Washington, including an upscale cafe in the Michelin Guide, an assisted-living facility, a soul food spot where old chicken bones clogged the hose and an Italian restaurant where two unfortunate rats had drowned in a grease bin while diving for a wayward meatball. By midafternoon, his truck had about 1,200 gallons of grease in its belly.

The company he works for, Mahoney Environmental, pays a few cents a gallon for the waste fat it collects from 90,000 businesses in the United States. Hundreds of companies gather grease around the globe — with an especially large haul in Southeast Asia, where densely packed restaurants serve up so much fried food that they’ve become the waste oil equivalent of Saudi Arabia’s rich petroleum fields.

Waste oil from kitchens and animal tallow leftover from meatpacking plants used to be recycled into livestock feed. But now, they are mostly turned into fuel: Fat molecules hold a lot of energy, and they’re relatively easy to rearrange into diesel and kerosene.

Turning fat into fuel keeps grease out of the landfill and petroleum in the ground. The demand, though, has begun to outstrip the supply.

“There’s only so many waste oils to go around, and … you can’t really squeeze out much more,” said Nikita Pavlenko, who leads the aviation and fuels team at the nonprofit International Council on Clean Transportation. “People aren’t going to be frying more food or processing more cattle to get waste tallow to make fuel. You’re kind of stuck with what you have.”

As regulators push companies to buy and make more fuel from fat, the price of grease has been rising, along with the crime surrounding it.

Thieves sometimes steal grease from collection bins and sell it themselves. Once, Howell said, he stopped at a restaurant only to find an empty bin and a confused cook, who told him an unmarked van had come by earlier and siphoned off their oil.

Grease fraud is a problem, too. In some areas, used cooking oil sells for more than new cooking oil, prompting hucksters to sell virgin oil — including palm oil, which is associated with deforestation in Southeast Asia — as if it were used. It’s hard to catch, since fresh oil spiked with a little restaurant grease is almost indistinguishable from the real thing.

“You’re potentially paying a premium for something that is worse than fossil fuel,” Pavlenko said.

Fuel companies crack down on fraud by hiring inspectors to go out and check that their grease suppliers really are pumping their product out of deep fat fryers. On his route, Howell takes pictures of every bin before and after he drains it and uploads the proof to a Mahoney Environmental app that verifies where his oil came from.

At the end of the day, Howell unloads his truck at a depot, where the oil is filtered to remove water, flour, spices and any other floating food chunks.

Turning fat into fuel

Used grease is a global commodity. Once it’s collected, tanker ships and pipelines carry it to fuel refineries around the world — much like they do for crude oil.

Grease ships arrive a couple of times a week at a refinery in Rotterdam run by Neste, the world’s top producer of sustainable jet fuel.

Fueling the appetite for sustainable fuel

In 2023, a Boeing 777 flew across the Atlantic Ocean burning fuel made from nothing but waste fat and sugar. The flight was a first, but it was really a publicity stunt — carrying Virgin Atlantic bigwigs, not paying passengers. The fuel is too expensive, and too scarce, for that to make business sense.

Instead, Neste blends its french fry fuel with standard kerosene made from crude oil before delivering it to airports.

SAF is almost identical to standard jet fuel, and it releases just as much CO2 when it’s burned. But experts say there’s a key difference: Drilling for oil takes carbon that was locked away underground and releases it into the atmosphere. Making fuel from used cooking oil and tallow takes carbon that was already circulating through the air and the bodies of plants and animals and recycles it. No new carbon moves from underground storage into the atmosphere.

It takes energy to collect and transport used cooking oil, rearrange fat molecules into jet fuel and get that fuel to planes. But, overall, making and burning SAF adds as much as 80 percent less carbon to the atmosphere as making and burning fossil fuel from crude oil.

Because there isn’t enough waste oil in the world to satisfy the airline industry’s thirst, companies are developing other ways to make low-carbon jet fuel. One option is to grow more crops like soy that can be crushed for oil and turned into jet fuel — although that raises the risk that more land will be cleared for farming in fragile ecosystems like the Brazilian Amazon. Environmentalists have raised similar concerns about raising more corn, sugar cane or beets to create ethanol and convert it into kerosene.

“The problem with crop-based biofuels is it takes land to produce them at a time when we’re already expanding cropland … which means more deforestation, and the carbon losses are far greater than the potential savings from reducing fossil fuel use,” said Tim Searchinger, a senior research scholar at Princeton’s Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment.

Alternately, farmers could grow more cover crops on their fields between their regular planting seasons, which would create a new source of plant oils or ethanol without using extra land. Some companies have experimented with turning trash into jet fuel, but the most prominent player went bankrupt last year. Others are splitting water molecules to harvest their hydrogen and combining it with captured carbon to make fuel.

Experts say it will take a combination of all these methods to make enough green fuel to power the world’s planes.

The one thing every alternative fuel recipe has in common is that they are more expensive than fossil fuel — and experts say they always will be. Making SAF from waste oil is “locked in at a cost which is about two times the cost of fossil jet, and it’s going to be entirely reliant on subsidies,” according to Pavlenko. The other methods could be even more expensive, even after they’ve had time to raise production and lower costs.

The future of the industry will depend on whether the United States keeps tax credits in place and the European Union stands by its green fuel mandates. Neste is expanding its Rotterdam refinery in anticipation of stricter E.U. blending rules, and in the United States, the first large-scale SAF operations started pumping out fuel in recent years in response to new tax credits that have since been weakened.

The announcement comes at a time of growing regulatory momentum and market demand for sustainable fuels. However, despite mandates such as the UK SAF mandate and ReFuelEU, high production costs remain a major barrier to widespread adoption.

“In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. “What we’re seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.”

The funding reflects increasing recognition that driving down SAF production costs is critical to unlocking aviation decarbonisation at scale. OXCCU’s process simplifies SAF production pathways by eliminating the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps. Instead, its patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction. This reduces capital and operating costs and reduces the carbon intensity of the fuel.

The catalyst’s ability to operate with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen input gas compositions gives it the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks such as reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

“We recognise the need for the world to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably” said Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at International Airlines Group (IAG). “IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030. Meeting these goals will be supported by this investment into OXCCU which is part of our strategy of developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.”

OXCCU’s solution meets both environmental and commercial demands, with applications that extend beyond aviation into chemicals and plastics.

In the Netherlands, a further increase in the air passenger tax is expected from 2027 onward. In Belgium the tax is EUR 10, Sweden has abolished it, and Germany is reportedly considering reversing its increase.

In addition to the development of new technologies in our own products such as engines and aircraft equipment, we are also supporting the de-risking and industrial scale-up of the most promising sustainable aviation fuel technologies.”

Daniel Goldman, Managing Partner and Co-founder of Clean Energy Ventures, said: ""OXCCU stands out not only for its differentiated technology but also for the speed of its progress toward commercial plants. In just a few years, the company has advanced from the lab to a commercial demonstration facility, proving that waste carbon and hydrogen can be converted directly into jet fuel at low cost. That rapid progress is reshaping the sustainable aviation fuel market, unlocking the affordability aviation needs to decarbonize. With the extraordinary leadership team and support of its strategic investors, we are confident OXCCU will lead the decarbonization of fuels and chemicals in the coming years.""

Dr Robert Trezona, Partner, Cleantech at IP Group, said: “This round is a significant milestone, not just for the Company, but for the sector – significant capital being put to work from established industry actors on a credible path to fully decarbonise aviation. OXCCU showcases the UK’s ability to lead in climate innovation, turning world-class science into global solutions, while generating jobs and lasting impact. We’re proud to continue to support the company as it scales its compelling single-step technology.”

OXCCU’s solution meets both environmental and commercial demands, with applications that extend beyond aviation into chemicals and plastics.

“This is a critical time for climate tech, as the urgency continues to increase” added Symes. “Aviation needs a solution, and the serious lever is SAF. The challenge is SAF cost and that is exactly what we are addressing at OXCCU.”

The programme uses the “book-and-claim” model (explained in full here), where companies co-fund the purchase of SAF and are able to claim the resulting emissions reduction for their sustainability reporting – even if the fuel is physically used on a different flight or route.

As you would expect, participating companies receive an audited SAF certificate from a verified third party, which can be used to report on Scope 3 emissions. The service also allows corporate customers to monitor the actual flight emissions generated by their business trips. Finnair says that a total of eight Finnair cargo and corporate customers have already signed up to support the use of SAF through the new service.

A new study published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), in partnership with Worley Consulting, says the main obstacle to the aviation industry’s Net Zero by 2050 goal is the slow roll-out of technology for producing SAF, not the availability of sustainable feedstocks.

The study provides “unequivocal evidence” that there is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources – which meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not cause land-use changes – to meet the projected 500 million tonnes (Mt) of SAF required annually by 2050.

Instead, IATA says that it is instead the slow pace of technology rollout required to convert such diverse feedstocks into SAF at scale..Currently, the only commercially scaled-up SAF production facilities use HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) technology, which primarily converts used cooking oil. Alternative, non-commercial technologies, which are necessary to unlock other abundant feedstocks, are not being deployed fast enough.

The industry also faces the challenge of competition from other sectors for the same sustainable biomass feedstocks. IATA argues that policies should prioritise allocating these resources to hard-to-abate sectors like aviation, and urges policymakers and business leaders in the energy sector to invest in and deploy the advanced technologies that are currently holding back production capacity.

Additionally IATA calls on the implementation of co-ordinated government policies that de-risk investment and support innovation to create a fully functioning SAF market and improve conversion efficiencies, feedstock logistics, and invest in the necessary infrastructure for commercial-scale SAF facilities across all regions.

iata.org

Sticking with SAF, The Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) Foundation has launched a new learning and collaboration hub called ‘SAF Corporate Connect’ to help the corporate travel industry integrate and accelerate the adoption of SAF.

The initiative is designed to address the knowledge gap among travel managers, procurement teams, and sustainability leaders, enabling them to confidently incorporate SAF into their programmes and better advise their clients and travellers.

The hub will provide corporate travel managers with the knowledge and practical tools needed to understand, evaluate, and integrate SAF into their company’s climate strategies and offers guidance SAF purchasing options – including book-and-claim models.

GBTA.org

Linking with IATA’s survey, The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has launched the Finvest Hub, a global platform designed to connect SAF and other low-carbon aviation project developers with the necessary public and private financing and investors.

The Finvest Hub will facilitate connections between SAF and low-carbon project developers worldwide and potential financiers, helping to de-risk investments while ensuring environmental integrity by using ICAO’s sustainability criteria. The platform is designed to unlock new financial mechanisms and create clear pathways for financial support to increase the production and deployment of SAF and other cleaner energy sources.

The first operational element of the hub is the Finvest@ETAF portal, launched in co-operation with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)’s Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) platform.

A key focus is prioritising support for developing states that face challenges in funding aviation sustainability projects, providing them with technical assistance, capacity building, and guidance on legal and policy frameworks to attract investment.

Finally, Travalyst, a not-for-profit organisation founded by Prince Harry in 2019, has launched a Data Hub which will enable environmental data to be shared with travellers during the booking process.

The initial version focuses on providing accommodation data for establishments’ environmental footprint across five categories: energy, waste, water, biodiversity and ecosystems, and destination and community.

The data is reviewed by an Independent Advisory Group, then distributed by Travalyst’s partners – including Booking.com, Expedia and Google – and shared with travellers on these platforms. The hub also ensures the data is standardised, allowing providers to be compared and ranked.

The new initiative follows Travalyst’s similar initiative with flights, scaling up Google’s Impact Model. This enables travellers to see the CO2 emissions for flights when searching on platforms like Google Flights. Yannis Simaiakis, director travel and local partnerships EMEA at Google, said, “We believe that the accommodation space is the next big area for the industry to drive change.”

Later versions of the hub are set to incorporate biodiversity and social sustainability data, encompassing accommodation, destinations, rail, and end-to-end journeys.

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","We came across a bullish thesis on Calumet, Inc. on The Pale Blue Dot’s Substack by Saad Khan. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on CLMT. Calumet, Inc.’s share was trading at $18.66 as of September 22nd. CLMT’s trailing and forward P/E were 23.06 and 11.35, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.

Calumet Specialty Products Partners ($CLMT) is a diversified specialty chemicals and fuels company with three core businesses: Specialty Products & Solutions (SPS), Performance Brands (PB), and Montana/Renewables (MRL). SPS and PB, generating mid-cycle EBITDA of roughly $285mm, are highly resilient due to a diverse customer base, flexible product offerings, and operational improvements including $42mm of cost reductions in H1 2025 and three consecutive quarters of strong throughput. Applying conservative industry multiples, these segments are valued at $2.3bn EV, or about $13 per share, implying an MRL EV of $1.1bn.

While MRL’s current EBITDA is modest at $65mm, there are compelling catalysts for a material inflection. Political support for biofuels, including higher Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) and reallocation of Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs), combined with MRL’s capacity expansion under the MAXSAF program, could lift EBITDA to $300mm+. MRL’s location in Montana allows feedstock optimization, and upcoming Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production is expected to benefit from a $1–$2 per gallon margin premium over renewable diesel.

Regulatory support, including favorable RIN pricing and reduced CLMT RIN obligations, enhances the upside. If these scenarios materialize, total company valuation using an 8x EBITDA multiple could exceed $30 per share, creating substantial upside from the current $17 level. Risks include unfavorable regulatory decisions, slower-than-expected capacity ramp, and high leverage, which could pressure free cash flow and equity returns. However, current EPA guidance and political trends suggest strong support for biofuels, setting the stage for a potential rerating and significant upside for investors positioned ahead of these catalysts.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Calumet, Inc. (CLMT) by Zerosumgame33 in April 2025, which highlighted the biodiesel margin inflection, MRL’s feedstock advantage, and potential upside from the 2026–2028 RVO. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 88% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as regulatory support and MRL expansion continue to drive upside. Saad Khan shares a similar bullish view but emphasizes operational improvements in SPS and PB and the impact of SAF and MAXSAF capacity on long-term EBITDA.

Calumet, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 19 hedge fund portfolios held CLMT at the end of the second quarter which was 22 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of CLMT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

READ NEXT: 30 Stocks That Should Double in 3 Years and 11 Hidden AI Stocks to Buy NOW

Disclosure: None.

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

« L’E-2D Advanced Hawkeye a été ravitaillé en vol, avec succès, par ces avions ravitailleurs de fabrication française.
Quant au troisième, il prendra d’abord la direction de l’atelier industriel de l’aéronautique de Cuers pour y recevoir des équipements de guerre électronique et de communication propres à la Marine nationale.","Mis en œuvre par la Flottille 4F de la Marine nationale, les trois avions de guet aérien E-2C Hawkeye ne peuvent pas être ravitaillés en vol, ce qui, malgré leur autonomie d’environ 6 heures [ou 1 450 nautiques], peut être un facteur limitant pour les opérations du groupe aérien embarqué [GAé] du porte-avions Charles de Gaulle. Mais cela ne sera pas le cas de leurs successeurs.

En effet, en 2021, le ministère des Armées a commandé trois E-2D Advanced Hawkeye auprès du constructeur américain Northrop Grumman pour 360 millions de dollars. Or, ces appareils auront la capacité d’être ravitaillés en vol, ce qui permettra d’augmenter considérablement leur temps de patrouille et d’étendre leur zone d’opération.

Alors que le premier exemplaire doit être livré à la Marine nationale en 2027, la Direction générale de l’armement [DGA] s’est attachée à vérifier que le Rafale Marine doté d’une nacelle NARANG [en configuration dite « nounou »], l’A400M et l’A330 MRTT étaient en mesure de ravitailler un E-2D Advanced Hawkeye en vol.

En novembre 2024, la DGA a procédé à un premier essai de ravitaillement en vol par un Rafale M « nounou » d’un A400M censé tenir le rôle d’un E-2D. L’objectif était de vérifier le comportement de la nacelle NARANG à vitesse réduite.

« Pour mener cette opération, le Rafale ravitailleur doit adopter une vitesse adéquate au fonctionnement de la nacelle de ravitaillement. La vitesse permet de stabiliser le panier qui relie le tuyau de ravitaillement à la perche de l’avion ravitaillé et d’actionner les pompes par une petite hélice située à l’avant de la nacelle qui tourne grâce à l’effet aérodynamique de l’air. Plus l’avion vole vite, plus l’hélice aura de l’énergie pour faire fonctionner l’ensemble », avait alors expliqué la DGA.

Ces essais se sont poursuivis jusqu’à l’été dernier, mais, cette fois, avec un E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, aux États-Unis. Outre un Rafale M « nounou », ils ont aussi impliqué un A400M et un A330 MRTT de l’armée de l’Air & de l’Espace. Et, selon un communiqué publié par le Naval Air Systems Command [NAVAIR] de l’US Navy, ils ont été concluants.

« La Marine nationale et l’armée de l’Air & de l’Espace ont effectué des essais qualitatifs de ravitaillement en vol avec des avions ravitailleurs français Rafale, A330 MRTT et A400M dans le cadre d’une collaboration entre le Bureau du programme de systèmes de commandement et de contrôle aéroportés E-2/C-2 et la Direction générale de l’armement », a rapporté le NAVAIR.

« L’E-2D Advanced Hawkeye a été ravitaillé en vol, avec succès, par ces avions ravitailleurs de fabrication française. C’est une première historique qui étend considérablement la portée de l’Advanced Hawkeye et permet des opérations conjointes transparentes tout en offrant des capacités de surveillance aéroportée sans précédent », a-t-il fait valoir. « Grâce à ses capacités de ravitaillement en vol, l’E-2D demeure la plateforme de commandement et de contrôle la plus avancée au monde », a-t-il ajouté.

Pour autant, les travaux ne sont pas totalement terminés. « La DGA et la Marine nationale assureront des essais supplémentaires de ravitaillement en vol ainsi que la formation des pilotes en France à mesure que les E-2C seront remplacés à partir de 2028 », a précisé le NAVAIR.

Selon le contre-amiral David Desfougères, le commandant de la force de l’aéronautique navale [ALAVIA], le premier E-2D Advanced Hawkeye sera en pris en charge par le Centre d’expérimentations pratiques et de réception de l’aéronautique navale [CEPA/10S] dès qu’il aura été livré tandis que le second rejoindra la Flottille 4F pour la formation des équipages. Quant au troisième, il prendra d’abord la direction de l’atelier industriel de l’aéronautique de Cuers pour y recevoir des équipements de guerre électronique et de communication propres à la Marine nationale.

Sans attendre la livraison de ces trois avions, « la formation du premier pilote d’essai a déjà commencé aux États-Unis », a confié le contre-amiral Desfougères à Var Matin.

Pour rappel, l’E-2D Advanced Hawkeye est équipé d’un radar à balayage mécanique et électronique AN/APY-9 capable de suivre simultanément, à 360°, un plus grand nombre de pistes, qu’elles soient navales ou aériennes. Il est aussi doté d’un système de mesure de soutien électronique [MSE] AN/ALQ-217, de la Liaison 16 et d’un dispositif IFF [identification amis/ennemis].

Invested as part of the government’s Future Flight programme, delivered by Innovate UK, the funding is designed to secure the UK’s global leadership in the future of aviation and the fast-growing field of drones and unmanned aircraft systems.

The technologies have the potential to transform industries from healthcare to energy and will become increasingly important to help deliver goods – including vital medical supplies – more quickly and efficiently, while cutting costs for the public sector and businesses. The sectors are also supporting increased numbers of highly-skilled jobs across the UK, boosting regional economies and delivering the Plan for Change.

Projects working on next-generation zero-emission aircraft and the development of vertical take-off and landing technology will also receive funding.

Aviation Minister, Keir Mather, said:

We’re backing the next generation of British aviation businesses whose transformative technologies will reshape how we live and work in the years to come.

Investing in emerging technologies like drones and unmanned aircraft is key to build a greener and more efficient transport system. But this isn’t just good news for the environment – this tech will also save our public sector and businesses valuable time and cash, while helping to boost skills and support high quality jobs across the country.

The announcement is the latest move by the government to build on the UK’s position as a leader in aerospace innovation, and follows a commitment to invest a record £14.9 billion in research and development, strengthening industries including life sciences, green energy and engineering and supporting careers that will grow the UK’s research ecosystem.

Among the successful projects are:

Beyond Restoration – a project transforming land restoration efforts across multiple UK sites by using long-range, heavy-lift drones to deliver environmental materials to remote and ecologically sensitive areas

the London Health Bridge Project – the UK’s leading medical drone delivery service, which will use the funding to significantly scale up its operations, aiming to increase from 1,000 to 50,000 medical sample deliveries per month

the Regional Offshore Cargo Drone Demonstrator – a pioneering Scottish project that will pilot the UK’s first heavy-lift drone logistics service tailored to support offshore wind farms

Simon Masters, Deputy Challenge Director for Future Flight at Innovate UK, said:

Innovate UK is proud to continue supporting the UK’s future flight ecosystem, accelerating the route to commercial operations and delivering real-world impact.

These ambitious new projects highlight the strength of the sector and its diverse applications, from reducing emissions, advancing healthcare delivery and protecting our environment.

By focusing on regional adoption, we aim to drive faster, more impactful growth and societal benefits for communities across the UK.

The government is committed to accelerating airspace modernisation across the sector to unlock growth, including by backing the development and use of sustainable aviation fuel, including through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, which will boost green fuel production in the UK and help deliver cleaner flights.

The government has committed £2.3 billion in funding over the next 10 years to the Aerospace Technology Institute programme, which helps the sector to manufacture newer, more efficient, electric aircraft.",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68d6957029e2934106866444/s960_drone-technology.png,N,,2025-09-28 20:56:54.477784

Klobuchar,Patrick,,,,,https://www.morningagclips.com/msga-directors-sound-economic-warning-in-meeting-with-sen-klobuchar/,"Not so, Klobuchar said during a visit to the Tyler, Minn., farm of Joel Schreurs, a director with the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association (MSGA).
Since April 2025, when trade tensions between China and the U.S. began increasing, China has effectively stopped purchasing U.S. soybeans.
“It’s a perfect storm of ugly.” Joel Schreurs underscored the importance of agriculture to rural towns throughout Minnesota and the country.
“Farmers want open markets more than anything, but the current situation is unsustainable,” Joel Schreurs said.
“We’re going to lose a lot of good farmers without an assistance package.” Joel Schreurs, who sits on the board of the U.S.","ST. PAUL, Minn. — Prior to attending the 40th Farm Aid benefit concert Sept. 20 in Minneapolis, Sen. Amy Klobuchar felt that perhaps the emerging crisis unfolding in the farm economy had fallen on deaf ears across the country.

Not so, Klobuchar said during a visit to the Tyler, Minn., farm of Joel Schreurs, a director with the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association (MSGA).

The dire message is being received.

“After Farm Aid, I think people are waking up to how bad it is right now (in agriculture),” she said during a roundtable discussion in Schreurs’ garage, where she was flanked by Schreurs and MSGA Director Bob Worth. “It’s gotten into their psyche, and I think they’re starting to see it.”

Worth said the current economic landscape reminded him of conditions that led to the creation of Farm Aid four decades ago.

“This is the 1980s farm crisis all over again,” Worth said.

Tariffs on many of U.S. soy’s largest trading partners have wreaked havoc on not just producers, but the entire ag supply chain. Since April 2025, when trade tensions between China and the U.S. began increasing, China has effectively stopped purchasing U.S. soybeans. In the 2023/2024 marketing year, China imported over $13 billion in U.S. soybeans. Replacing that market takes years, not weeks or months. Additionally, in contrast to the 2018-2019 trade war, tariffs have gone beyond China to affect U.S. soy customers across the globe. Combine low commodity prices with a widening basis and input costs that remain stubbornly high, and it’s hard to look for a bright economic spot as farmers head out into the fields to harvest what’s predicted to be a near-record soybean crop.

“It’s a weird combination of bad circumstances,” Klobuchar said, adding, “We’ve got to find a way out.”

Matt Schreurs, Joel’s cousin and vice president of ag lending with First Farmers and Merchant Bank, explained to the senator that the numbers aren’t adding up for producers in his region. Some growers are seeing losses totaling $180 per acre.

“I’m looking at a lot of red ink,” said Matt Schreurs, a member of MSGA. “It’s a perfect storm of ugly.”

Joel Schreurs underscored the importance of agriculture to rural towns throughout Minnesota and the country. He’s also concerned how younger farmers will be impacted.

“When ag does well in southwest Minnesota, so does our local economy,” he said.

Instead of wallowing in bad news, Joel, Matt, Worth and Executive Director Joe Smentek offered a series of recommendations to Sen. Klobuchar that could lead to economic improvement across farm country in the months ahead:

Removal of tariffs on U.S. soybeans through negotiations

Unfreeze USAID funding. Food aid programs through USAID help build a positive, long-tern reputation for U.S. agriculture across decades. In FY2024, about $110 million worth of U.S. soy was purchased by USAID for Food for Peace

Passing a skinny Farm Bill before year’s end to ensure critical programs continue to receive funding

Supporting renewable fuels through higher blends of biodiesel and using soybean oil as a primary feedstock in sustainable aviation fuel

“There’s got to be some sort of resolution,” Klobuchar said.

Without a trade deal with China, the farmers agreed, financial assistance will likely be warranted to prevent a full-blown catastrophe in the ag economy.

“Farmers want open markets more than anything, but the current situation is unsustainable,” Joel Schreurs said. “We’re going to lose a lot of good farmers without an assistance package.”

Joel Schreurs, who sits on the board of the U.S. Soybean Export Council (USSEC), thanked the senator, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee, for supporting policies that are helping to grow market access beyond China and invited her to visit emerging markets that are working with USSEC through the Soy Excellence Center.

“We had great discussions and let her know what we’re thinking and where we want to go from here,” he said.

Schreurs’ efforts to grow markets continue. On Sept. 30, he’s hosting a Southeast Asian trade delegation alongside Northern Soy Marketing.
