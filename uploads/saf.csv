Food waste is an underdeveloped source for production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Now, there is no certified conversion process of food waste for SAF by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). We report the use of zeolite-supported molybdenum carbide nanocatalysts in upgrading biocrudes, produced from food wastes through HTL, into SAF precursors. Our data show a complete removal of oxygen from the biocrude through hydrodeoxygenation and a higher heating value of 46.5 MJ/kg, which is comparable to that of Jet A (46.1 MJ/kg). The prescreening tests (tier alpha and beta) show the average carbon number of the distillation cut (150° to 230°C) of upgraded fuel is 10.6, close to the value of 11.4 for average conventional jet fuel, and the specifications of properties including surface tension, viscosity, heating value, flash point, and freezing point were found to meet the standards of SAF. The metal carbide nanocatalysts were reusable in upgrading tests, and the activity of deoxygenation was retained.

INTRODUCTION

Large-scale production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) (1, 2) from wet wastes is crucial to achieve the target of reaching net zero carbon emission by 2050 (3). This is because SAF has less safety concern than other alternative energy carriers such as hydrogen and has a volumetric energy density (34 MJ/liter) 4.0 to 6.9 times higher than hydrogen. Thus, SAF has been considered the only net zero mechanism for long-haul wide-body aircrafts over the next several decades (4). In addition, SAFs are drop-in compatible with all existing infrastructure and aircraft. Therefore, the existing extensive infrastructure in aviation and their current regulatory compliance can be leveraged under the aviation decarbonization strategy with SAFs.

Triglyceride, lignocellulosic biomass, and sugar/starch are three typical sources for SAF production (5). While lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock is cheaper than the other two, it requires expensive and complicated processing (6, 7). Sugar including starch is mainly used for generating light fuels consisting of short carbon chain components and requires multistep conversions, including fermentation (to produce alcohols), dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation (8). Catalytic hydrotreating of triglyceride feedstock, on the other hand, can be a relatively simple approach, in which hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), hydroisomerization, and hydrocracking can simultaneously take place (9). Other than the benefit of facile processing, using triglyceride-based wet waste as feedstock also increases energy recovery (10, 11), valorizes unwanted bioresources, and alleviates water contamination caused by organic substances (12).

A major class of biocrude oil is made from triglyceride-based wet wastes through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) (9, 13–15) and will be used in this study for upgrading to SAFs. A standard set of specifications derived from conventional fuels has been established to prescreen if an upgraded product is suitable as SAF precursor (16). An important criterion is, unlike diesel fuel, a SAF precursor should not contain oxygen, which must be removed to prevent corrosion of jet engine by oxygen-containing compounds such as organic acids. Oxygen also adversely increases density and viscosity of a biocrude oil. The optimal number of carbons in hydrocarbons for aviation fuel, which affects the flash and freezing point of a fuel, is typically in the range of C8 to C16. The preferred jet fuel consists of oxygen-free organics of paraffins, isoparaffins, naphthenes, and aromatics (17). Higher heating value (HHV), which can be estimated by elemental (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen) contents of a fuel, is another key parameter and should be close to that of Jet A. In short, it is essential to develop scalable and highly reactive catalysts and to demonstrate their use in the production of SAF precursors using real biocrude based on the studies using model compounds (18, 19).

Transition metal carbides (TMCs), such as beta phase molybdenum carbide (β-Mo2C), have unique catalytic properties because of their platinum-like electronic structures (20, 21). Recently, β-Mo2C catalysts were shown to exhibit HDO activity comparable to platinum and palladium using model compounds such as oleic acid and guaiacol (18, 22–24). Both metal-like hydrogen adsorption sites and Brønsted acid hydroxyl sites on β-Mo2C surface were thought to be beneficial to the HDO reaction (24, 25). These carbide catalysts also resist poisoning and corrosion from impurities under harsh conditions using model compounds (22–24, 26, 27). While these studies are extremely useful, model reactions are far from sufficient to evaluate the suitability of wet waste–derived biocrude for SAF because the complexity in composition of biocrude oil cannot be replicated by model compounds (22, 23). In addition, using model compounds one cannot evaluate the whole ranges of specifications of the fuel, including viscosity, freezing point, flash points, to name a few (28). Hydrodeoxygenation of HTL biocrude oil from food waste has been demonstrated using alumina-supported metal alloy catalysts, including CoMo and NiMo. Sulfided CoMo/Al2O3 and NiMo/Al2O3 catalysts were used previously to produce SAF from HTL biocrudes of food waste at 400°C, 1500 psi, and 0.5-hour−1 weight hour space velocity (13). The upgraded biocrude achieved 93% deoxygenation using CoMo catalysts and 91% using NiMo catalysts, increasing to 98% after taking the jet fuel cut. In addition, a two-stage hydrotreating approach using CoMo for demetallization and mild hydrotreating, followed by NiMo for more severe hydrotreating, achieved 97% deoxygenation of HTL biocrude from food waste, producing a diesel-rich product (9). Thus, investigation of Mo2C-based nanocatalysts in the upgrading of real biocrude oil is much needed to establish the proper processing pathways to the SAF production from wet waste–derived biocrudes (29, 30).

Herewith we report the use of zeolite-supported iron–β-Mo2C nanocatalysts in the upgrading of real biocrude oil, derived from wet food waste by HTL, to a SAF precursor that meets all essential criteria in the FAA standard tier beta test. In our approach, β-Mo2C nanocatalysts were dispersed onto zeolite supports (25, 31, 32) to enhance the catalyst dispersion, thus giving rise to a high HDO activity (19). Zeolite Socony Mobil–5 (ZSM-5) was chosen as the catalyst support for its capability to dispersing molybdenum carbide (25) and to produce high aromatic yields with low coke formation (33). Iron (Fe) was used as the cocatalyst and incorporated into the metal carbide to promote cracking (34–38). Previously, Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts were reported to exhibit good cracking performance and a Fe loading amount as low as 5 weight % (wt %) could be sufficient to modify the overall acidity (37). The 3-nm Fe-containing β-Mo2C nanoparticle catalyst on ZSM-5 (Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5) was synthesized via carburization method at 600°C. This catalyst exhibited excellent HDO activity, resulting in complete removal of oxygen from the biofuel and an increase in hydrogen-to-carbon atomic (H/C) ratio to 1.96. Tier beta test indicates upgraded biocrude oil satisfied all key specifications of SAF prescreening standards, including surface tension (at 22°C), density (at 15°C), viscosity (at −20° and −40°C), lower heating value (LHV), flash point, and freezing point. In this context, we successfully produced 100% SAF precursors from food waste–derived biocrude oils using non-noble metal nanocatalysts.

RESULTS

Compositional and structural characterization of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5

The Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst was synthesized at 600°C via the carburization method. For safety consideration, freshly made Mo2C catalyst was passivated using 2% O2 in the tube furnace before the characterizations and subsequent catalytic studies (see Materials and Methods for detail). The atomic ratio of Fe to Mo in the precursor is 5%. The stated amount of Fe cocatalyst was chosen on the basis of the prior study, in which 5 wt % on ZSM-5 provided the suited acidity for cracking with low coking effect (25, 33–38). Our experience study indicates a temperature of 600°C or above was required to produce Mo2C. Inductively coupled plasma optical atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) shows the catalyst contains 1.30 wt % Fe and 41.9 wt % Mo, which is close to the nominal amount of 1.26 wt % Fe and 43.1 wt % Mo in the reactant mixture (table S1). X-ray diffraction (XRD) study indicates the as-made catalyst consists of phase-pure β-Mo2C on ZSM-5, with no diffraction from Fe-containing species (Fig. 1A). Mo2C nanocatalyst without Fe was made following the same synthetic procedure except without the addition of iron (III) nitrate. This Fe-free sample exhibits enhanced crystallinity of Mo2C, judging by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and peak intensity (Fig. 1A). The addition of Fe effectively reduced the crystal domain size of Mo2C. The FWHM and positions of XRD peaks for ZSM-5 are similar in the three samples, suggesting no major change in zeolite structure. This structural stability is beneficial for the dispersion of metal precursors and the formation of metal carbide nanoparticle catalysts (25, 39). Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) study shows the ZSM-5 particles have an average size of ~2 μm, which are made of aggregates of ~200-nm crystallites (fig. S1). This hierarchical morphology retained for Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts (fig. S2).

The Mo2C nanoparticle catalysts were further examined by both SEM (Fig. 1B) and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) (Fig. 1C). The microscopic data show that the size of catalyst particles can be as large as ~30 nm, although the primary nanoparticles are only a few nanometers in size. The XRD Rietveld refinement data indicate the crystal domain size is about 3.0 nm (fig. S3 and table S2). The small sub–5-nm Mo2C crystallites were observed to disperse evenly over the ZSM-5 support, judging by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and STEM micrographs (figs. S4 and S5). The fast Fourier transform analysis indicates the lattice observed in HAADF-STEM has a d-spacing of 0.27 nm, which correspond to Mo2C (100) and of 0.22 nm to the (101) facet (Fig. 1C and fig. S6). These results show the carburization could successfully produce carbide nanoparticles with size optimal for catalysis, which is advantageous over the commercial Mo2C (figs. S7 and S8). STEM energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) shows both Fe and Mo elements are dispersed uniformly across the catalyst particles. (Fig. 1D and fig. S9).

Upgrading and characterization of biocrude oil

The upgrading of biocrude oil was performed using a Parr reactor as illustrated in Fig. 2A. The biocrude oil derived from the HTL process was mixed with freshly prepared Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst at a catalyst/biocrude mass ratio of 6:100. All catalytic upgrading was conducted at 400°C in pressurized H2 for 2 hours, unless otherwise stated. Elemental analysis data indicate the oxygen content in the oil decreased from 6.74 to ~0 wt % after the upgrading using Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5, showing a complete deoxygenation (Fig. 2B and table S3). After the hydrodeoxygenation process, 6.6 ml (or 4.8 g) of SAF precursor could be obtained from 10 ml of the biocrude oil (density: 0.857 g/ml). This result corresponds to a conversion of about 56 wt % from pretreat biocrude to SAF precursor, similar to the conversion to hydrocarbon from volatile fatty acids derived from the biobased chemicals through the anaerobic digestion (40). The hydrogen content increased from 12.26 to 14.08 wt %, corresponding to an increase of HHV from 41.80 to 46.51 MJ/kg, which is comparable to that of Jet A (table S4). The substantial improvement in oil quality could also be readily observed from the color change of oils before and after the treatment (fig. S10). To understand the effects of processing variables such as temperature and hydrogen pressure, we conducted upgrading experiments in the absence of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst while keeping all other conditions the same. The oxygen content decreased to 1.70 wt %, which was equal to about 75% of deoxygenation. The hydrogen content of oil, however, only slightly increased to 13.0 wt %. We analyzed the H/C ratio of the upgraded oil, which is a measure of the degree of saturation of organic compounds after the catalytic hydrogenation. Our results show after the treatment by Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst, the oil product exhibited an H/C ratio of 1.96, much higher than that of 1.82 if no catalyst was used. Noticeably, the upgraded oil exhibited the H/C ratio, thus the heating value, comparable to that of Jet A. The oil produced after treatment with commercial Mo2C, however, shows no improvement or even worse than the raw biocrude oil in H/C ratio and oxygen content, with 9.8 wt % O and 12.0 wt % H. Our study shows the nanometer-sized Mo2C particle and zeolite/Fe compositions in the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts are necessary to achieve high HDO activity.

We further investigated the distribution of boiling point of the upgraded oils by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (fig. S11A). The weight percentage of upgraded oil after treatment using the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 nanocatalysts are preferably in the low-temperature regions, with decreased distribution in temperature range above 250°C, as contrast to those treated without catalyst or with the commercial Mo2C (fig. S11B). The weight distribution heatmaps of different oils were obtained by calculating the integral of percentage weight over different temperature ranges (Fig. 2C and table S5). A decrease of weight distribution was observed in the range of 250° to 300°C for all oil samples after the catalytic treatment. This result suggests long carbon chain substances in the oils were cracked in pressurized H2 at 400°C. Weight distribution above 350°C slightly increases for upgraded oils using no catalyst or the commercial Mo2C, which could be caused by the polymerization reaction during upgrading. These two oil products also exhibit relatively uniform weight distributions across 100° to 300°C, while the upgraded oil using the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst shows the predominant fraction is in the temperature range of 150° to 250°C. Because the wet waste–derived biocrude oil is composed of a mixture of different components, an overall weight distribution towards the lighter range increases the percentage of distillation cut that meets the SAF standards (table S6). In a different classification (fig. S11C), our catalytic treatment could upgrade the “diesel-like” raw biocrude oils into “kerosene/gasoline-like” fuels, noting the property of Jet A is regarded as gasoline-like (41).

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was carried out to study the distribution of molecular weight of compounds in various oils (fig. S12 and table S7), which is directly related to the length of carbon chains. An interval of 100 Da was used in our calculation of the number-weighed molecular weight (Fig. 2D). The molecular weight distribution between 100 and 300 Da was given special attention, since carbon chains in the range of C8 to C16 are preferred for SAFs. In the raw biocrude oil, a total of 25.9 wt % was found to locate in this range of molecular weight distribution, while 8.0 and 22.9 wt % were found for the oil products after treatments without the catalyst and with commercial Mo2C, respectively. After the treatment with Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst, 59.4 wt % of the upgraded oil was found in this molecular weight distribution, which is comparable to that of Jet A (62.1 wt %). The upgraded oil has lower molecular weights in all intervals above 300 Da. Table S7 summarizes the number-averaged molecular weights (Mn) and mass-averaged molecular weights (Mm) of all oils tested. Upgraded oil using the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst has a Mn of 254 Da, which is comparable with that of Jet A (242 Da) and much lower than those of raw biocrude oil (404 Da) and the oil product obtained using the other catalysts (522 and 389 Da). The substantial reduction in molecular weight results in the change in density of the oils after the upgrading treatments (table S8). Among all oils tested, raw biocrude oil has the highest density of 0.853 g/ml, and the upgraded oil using Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 has the lowest density of 0.783 g/ml.

Prescreening results as a SAF precursor

The property of hydrocarbon in the product was analyzed on the full distillate range fuel using two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) using the standard methods described elsewhere (Fig. 3A) (42). The full distillate of upgraded biocrude oil ranges from C5 to C21, with an average carbon number of 11.2 close to that of the conventional jet fuel (11.4), and exhibits a bimodal distribution peaked around C8 and C18, consisting of n- and iso-alkanes (69.7%), cycloalkanes (21.5%), and aromatics (8.8%). While the average carbon number is similar to that of jet fuel, the bimodal carbon distribution needs further treatment to pass the ASTM D4054 evaluation. Thus, it is pragmatic to extract the most suitable fraction of the upgraded oil for SAF certification tests.

We obtained the target fraction from the full range biocrude oil by performing distillation, which was executed from 150° to 230°C, focusing on meeting the flash point and freezing point specification limits of the final fuel because these two properties are crucial to address aviation safety issues (43). The front end of distillation is determined to be 150°C, matching that of the conventional jet fuel to ensure a comparable flash point. The back end of the distillation, however, is truncated at 230°C, instead of 260°C for jet fuel, due to the concentrated n-alkanes in the obtained biocrude oil. Freezing point of fuels is typically dominated by molecules having the highest freezing points in oil (44), normally the heaviest hydrocarbon species. Higher carbon number n-alkanes generally have higher freezing points than their isomerized counterparts. The inclusion of C14 to C16 components in the SAF cut is detrimental to the increase of freezing point. Thus, we reduced the back end of the distillation range to ensure a proper freezing point. The yield of SAF precursors from the temperature range of 150° to 230°C is ~15 wt %.

Figure 3B illustrates the analysis of hydrocarbon types of the distilled SAF precursor. The average carbon number of the SAF fraction is 10.6 compared to 11.4 for conventional jet fuel. Compared to the full range oil, the SAF precursor has higher contents of cycloalkanes (25.4%) and aromatics (12.1%), with a distribution peaked around C10. Tier beta prescreening was conducted on the distilled SAF fraction, evaluating properties such as surface tension, density, kinematic viscosity, LHV, flash point, freezing point, and distillation curve. The derived cetane number (DCN) is predicted from estimation due to the volume limitation. These properties are critical for combustor figures of merits and operability limits (17). Aligning the SAF precursor within the specification limit can mitigate risks at the earliest stage of conversion technology development. As shown in Fig. 3C, our SAF fraction demonstrated excellent surface tension, smaller than 24 mN/m at 22°C, which is better than the experience range of conventional jet fuel. The viscosity at −20° and −40°C also outperformed the conventional jet fuel. The density of obtained SAF precursor is relatively low compared with the conventional fuel but still within the acceptable range. Low values in these properties enhance combustor operability limits and are attributed to the cutoff point of 230°C, which excludes heavier fractions (>C14). Energy density of this oil is much higher than the other cuts, as suggested by the LHV ~43.50 MJ/kg, which can be attributed to the high concentration of n- and iso-alkanes. The flash point of SAF precursor is well fitted within the experience range, suggesting a close resemblance with conventional jet fuel regarding the light components. The freezing point is superior because of the approach of excluding >C14 substances. Thus, an optimal distillation range was identified for this fuel to achieve a balance between SAF yield and control of specific properties, such as freezing point. Tier alpha property predictions indicate a high DCN value for the SAF fraction, which could result from the richness of n- and iso-alkane content. Overall, the obtained distillate cut reached the threshold for key physical properties set for SAF, indicating that Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 is an appropriate catalyst for converting food waste–derived biocrude oil to high-quality SAF product, and other conversion pathway and processing protocol need to be further developed.

Figure 3C summarizes the results of an overall assessment performed by evaluating the distillation curve, which contrasts against that of the conventional jet fuel. Our SAF precursor falls in the experience range up to ~60 wt %, with the heavy section slightly deviating from the target due to the lack of C14 to C16 components in the distillate to meet the freezing point specification, which is related to the high concentration of n-alkane (52.2%). From an economic perspective, the current conversion pathway is attractive because besides the SAF precursor, the C4 to C8 cut can be used for gasoline and the C14 to C21 cut as biodiesel. Heavier fraction (C22 and above) in the biocrude can be upgraded for marine fuel or lubricant. We noted that a multistep approach was previously developed using methane as a feedstock to produce n-paraffin SAF designed as a 10 vol % blend (40). In that process, instead of directly upgrading biocrude, methane was converted into mixed volatile C2 to C8 fatty acids (VFAs) via anaerobic digestion. Ketonization over ZrO2 and hydrodeoxygenation over Pt/Al2O3 were then carried out to convert the wet waste–derived VFAs into normal paraffins.

Compositional and structural stability of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst

We investigated the stability of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 by reusing this catalyst for multiple runs (Fig. 4A). In a standard test, after the reaction, the solids including catalyst were separated from the upgraded oil by centrifugation, washed by acetone, and dried at 80°C in a vacuum oven. The Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 after the first upgrading test, which is denoted as Cat-1, was collected and separated from the upgraded oil (i.e., Oil-1) and used as the catalyst for the second upgrading. No reactivation of catalyst was needed, and all reaction conditions were kept the same for all the catalytic upgrading study (Fig. 4A). Figure 4B shows the HDO activity of reused Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts by analyzing the elemental contents of three upgraded oils. No oxygen was detected in all three upgraded oils, suggesting ~100% deoxygenation efficiency (table S9). The hydrogen content of upgraded oils decreased slightly from 14.08 wt % (Oil-1) to 13.74 wt % for Oil-2 and 13.85 wt % for Oil-3. The H/C molar ratio changed from 1.96 (Oil-1) to 1.90 for Oil-2 and 1.90 for Oil-3. The reused Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts (Cat-1 and Cat-2) were still active to produce upgraded oils with the HHV that is comparable to Jet A (~ 46.10 MJ/kg; table S4). Elemental analysis results indicate density of the three upgraded oils is consistent (0.779 to 0.783 g/ml; table S10). Both Oil-2 and Oil-3 exhibited higher carbon content. TGA results show the boiling point distributions for all thee upgraded oils are concentration in the range of 150° to 250°C (Fig. 4C; figs. S13, A and B; and table S11).

XRD and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to examine the structures of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst after each run of upgrading of biocrude oils. The XRD study shows β-Mo2C and ZSM-5 phases retained for all reused Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts (i.e., Cat-1, Cat-2, and Cat-3) and no identifiable coke formed (fig. S14). The morphology and particle size of post-upgrading Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts did not show major difference from that of the freshly prepared (fig. S15). Rietveld refinement analysis indicates the average size of Mo2C nanoparticles remained to be in the range of sub–3 nm (fig. S16 and table S12), which were also observed in the high-resolution electron microscopic images (fig. S17). Surface composition of the reused catalyst was investigated by comparing the valence state of Mo and C based on the XPS study (fig. S18 and table S13). The intensity of Mo(II) peaks for Cat-1 at 231.8 eV (3d3/2) and 228.6 eV (3d5/2) is comparable to that of fresh catalyst. Carbon peaks in the carbides were observed for both Cat-1 and fresh catalysts and no detectable change of surface Mo2C nanoparticles after the upgrading run, indicating good structural and compositional stability.

The XPS Fe 2p data show Fe2+ or Fe3+ 2p1/2 (~724 eV) and 2p3/2 (~710 eV) signals appeared in the Cat-1 sample besides the Fe0 2p3/2 (~707 eV) in the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 (fig. S18) (45, 46). This observation indicates the nanocatalysts could be oxidized either during or after the upgrading process, suggesting that the structures of Fe species might change in the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5. We also performed TGA analysis of fresh Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 and Cat-1 to further study coke formation (fig S19). The mass loss curves for both samples show comparable curves in terms of the weight loss in the entire temperature range. In the temperature range between 270° and 400°C, Cat-1 exhibits larger derivative in weight gain than that of the fresh catalyst. These data suggest the oxidizable species in Cat-1 such as carbide and iron could take up oxygen faster than the freshly made catalysts, in agreement with the XPS Fe 2p data. Nevertheless, the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst is readily reusable for oil upgrading, suggesting that the highly reducing condition of hydrodeoxygenation reaction is highly tolerable of initial structure changes, and catalysts can be regenerated in situ during the process.

DISCUSSION

This work demonstrates the feasibility of catalytic upgrading of wet waste–derived biocrude oil into SAF precursors using zeolite-supported Mo2C nanocatalyst. We found that Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited excellent HDO activity to fully deoxygenate the biocrude oil produced from HTL process. We achieved a yield of 56 wt % for SAF precursor from pretreated biocrude, equivalent to a food waste to SAF production yield of 23 wt %, based on a yield of 59 wt % from food waste to biocrude and a loss of 30 wt % during the pretreatment of biocrude (47–49). The upgrade oil exhibits the HHV over 46.10 MJ/kg comparable to Jet A. This high performance can be attributed to the nanometer-sized Mo2C catalyst on Bronsted acid–based zeolitic supports, which remain compositionally and structurally stable in the stability tests. This work develops low-cost metal carbide catalysts and demonstrates their potential in converting biocrude oils, oleochemical-based fermentation products, and crop residue-derived biomass into SAF candidates.

Ammonium molybdate (para) tetrahydrate [(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 99%, A13766] and the reference beta-phase molybdenum carbide (β-Mo2C, 99.5% metals basis, 012192.36) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate ( ≥98%; ACS reagent, 216828) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Zeolite ZSM-5 (ammonium, 045880.22) and quartz wool (fine, 4 μm; 451040100) were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Methane [ultra-high purity (UHP)], hydrogen (UHP), argon (UHP), compressed air (breathing quality grade), and nitrogen were purchased from Airgas. Acetone (ACS grade, A18-4) was purchased from Fisher Chemical. Jet A sample was obtained from a local airport. Biocrude oil was produced from HTL via our laboratory-made continuous plug-flow pilot reactor using food waste as feedstock, as detailed in previous work (47–49). In summary, salad dressing waste (62% lipid, 30% carbohydrate, 2% protein, and 6% ash) was obtained from a local food processing plant and homogenized to a solids content of 20 wt %. The food waste was converted at 300°C and 11 MPa, with a retention time of 20 min, yielding 59 wt % biocrude by mass. Before upgrading, the HTL biocrude oil was washed and distilled to remove salt (mainly Na and K), excess water, and ash. In all experiments, deionized (DI) water (resistivity of 18.25 MΩ·cm at room temperature, Millipore) was used.

Synthesis of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5

The metal precursor was prepared via the wet impregnation method. In a 100-ml flask, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (171.6 mg), (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (1.5 g), and ZSM-5 (1.0 g) were added to 20 ml of DI water. The mixture was heated at 80°C (250 rpm) for 8 hours in an oil bath using a hotplate stirrer (VWR 7x7 Ceramic Hotplate Stirrer, 97042-714). After water evaporated, the remaining mixture was further dried at 80°C in a vacuum oven (VWR Symphony Vacuum Oven, catalog no. 414004-582) overnight. The dried solids were collected and ground into a fine powder. The powder precursor (1.0 g) was loaded into a quartz tube, which was placed inside a vertical furnace. Quartz wool was used as a support for the powder precursor in a vertically placed tube. After the assembly, the quartz tube was purged with a flowing gas mixture of CH4/H2 (flow rate ratio: 8/32, 40 sccm in total). The subsequent carburization step was programmed to firstly reach 300°C at a rate of 4°C/min and then to 600°C at 1°C/min. The temperature was then kept at 600°C for 2 hours. After the furnace was naturally cooled to room temperature, the quartz tube was purged by N2 for 10 min (90 sccm). The N2-protected solids were carefully transferred from the quartz tube to a test tube (length > 10 cm) filled with Ar to avoid exposure of catalyst to air. The test tube was then sealed with Parafilm for future usage in oil upgrading. The time of storage was typically <24 hours. Considering the pyrophoric nature of metal carbide nanoparticles, we synthesized the catalyst right before the upgrading tests. For material characterization, the as-made catalysts were passivated in 2% O2 (a mixture of 10 sccm compressed air and 90 sccm N2) for 1 hour after the purge by N2 in the furnace for 10 min. The sample can be safely removed from the quartz tube. [Caution: Freshly made molybdenum carbide nanoparticles are highly reactive if they are not passivated and ignite upon their exposure to ambient air.]

Structural and compositional characterization of catalysts

XRD patterns were obtained using Rigaku Miniflex 600 diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα x-ray source (λ =1.54056 Å). The size analysis based on XRD patterns were conducted using a profile fitting software, TOPAS, provided by Bruker Corporation. This software was used to obtain the volume-weighted mean crystallite sizes (LVol-IB) calculated from Scherrer equation based on Rietveld refinement results. SEM images were obtained from Hitachi S-4800 SEM. TEM micrographs were from JEOL 2100 Cryo microscope. High-resolution STEM and EDS studies were conducted using FEI Themis Z advanced probe aberration corrected analytical scanning/transmission electron microscope. The mass contents of Fe and Mo in the samples were determined by ICP-OES using a PerkinElmer Optima 8300 system. XPS data were obtained using Kratos Axis Supra+ Photoelectron spectrometer, and the corresponding data analysis was performed using CasaXPS software. The identification, deconvolution, and assignment of XPS peaks were based on the references provided in an XPS handbook (45, 46). The XPS data were analyzed after the calibration using the adventitious carbon peak at binding energy of 284.80 eV. The deconvolution of overlapped peaks in Mo 3d spectra was carried out using the principle of spin-orbit splitting ratio for 3d spectrum, i.e., 2:3 for the signals from 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, respectively.

Catalytic upgrading tests of biocrude oils

Upgrading tests of biocrude oils were carried out using a 100-ml Parr 4598 reactor with a Parr 4848 reactor controller. The biocrude oil (10 ml) was added to an Ar-protected, freshly prepared, non-passivated Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst (~0.5 g) in the test tube. The mixture was stirred and transferred to a 100-ml stainless steel reaction chamber, which was then assembled in the Parr reactor. The reactor was purged with ~500-psi H2 three times before it was pressurized to 1500-psi H2 (~20°C), followed by a heat treatment at 400°C for 2 hours. The heating rate was set at ~25°C/min. The maximum pressure in the reactor was ~2200 psi at 400°C. After the reaction, the reactor was quenched in cold water for 10 min. The upgraded oils and used catalysts were collected and separated by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 10 min (Beckman Coulter Inc., Allegra X-30 Series). The used catalysts were washed with acetone three times before drying in the vacuum oven overnight. For control experiments using commercial Mo2C or ZSM-5, all reaction conditions were kept the same other than the catalysts used. The weight of individual components, other than the total amount of catalysts, was also kept the same, i.e., ~0.5 g of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 was replaced with ~0.23 g of commercial Mo2C or ~0.27 g of commercial ZSM-5 in the control upgrading tests, according to the theoretical value based on feeding ratio (table S1). When performance was tested with the used Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5, all reaction conditions were kept the same other than the catalyst. The amount of used Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 for the upgrading test is 0.5 g. No pretreatment or reactivation of used catalysts was conducted.

Characterization of biocrude oils and analytical methods

The elemental content was determined using CE440 CHN analyzer from Exeter Analytical. The oxygen content was calculated by the difference, i.e., 100-∑(C+H+N) (wt %). The HHV of biocrude oils was calculated using Dulong’s formula (50). The boiling point distribution of oil samples was obtained using a Q50 Thermogravimetric Analyzer from TA Instruments. The sample was placed in a heating chamber purged with N2, which could mimic the distillation processing. The samples were heated from room temperature to 600°C at a rate of 20°C/min in N2 flow at atmospheric pressure. The TGA data analysis was performed using Universal Analysis 2000 software, provided by TA Instruments, Waters LLC. The distribution of molecular weight of the compounds in biocrude oils was studied by performing MALDI-TOF-MS using Bruker Autoflex Speed LRF instrument. The scan range of mass spectra is between 50 and 1500 Da. The Mn, Mm, and polydispersity index (I) were calculated using the following equations

Mn=∑(Mi×Ni∑Nj)=∑(MiNi)∑Nj

(1)

Mm=∑[Mi×MiNi∑(MjNj)]=∑(Mi2Ni)∑(MjNj)

(2)

I=MmMn

(3)

where Mi and Ni are the mass (in unit of Da) and background-corrected abundance of the ith oligomer, respectively. The background baseline is determined on the basis of averaged noise level of the mass spectra. The polydispersity index (I) measures the dispersion of molecular weights of chemical compounds in the oil, i.e., I of one suggests a homogenous weight distribution, and larger I values (i.e., I > 1) imply widely dispersed weight distribution.

Hydrocarbon type analysis was performed using two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC), of which detailed setup can be found in a previous work (42). The oil went through distillation using a Micro Spinning Band from B/R Instrument, which offers excellent theoretical plates and minimal dead volume. The distillate cut was executed from 150° to 230°C based on the flash point and freezing point specification limits (43).

In its latest sustainability report, Singapore Airlines Group reported that total emissions rose more than 13% over the past financial year, from 18.8 million tonnes of CO₂e to 21.4 million tonnes. The airline, which has orders for over 70 new planes, pointed to strong passenger demand and ongoing airspace restrictions, which have forced longer flight routes, as key reasons behind the increase.

The company’s CEO, Goh Choon Phong, said its investment in newer aircraft, which the industry says emits up 25% less carbon, will help in plans to reduce emissions to almost zero by 2050.

“Our long-term commitment to investing in and operating new-generation aircraft puts us in a strong position,” Goh said. “As of 31 March 2025, the average age of the Group’s operating fleet was seven years and eight months, well below the global average of 15 years.”

Rising Costs From Climate Rules and Compliance

At the same time, the carrier warned that complying with international climate regulations could come at a significant cost in the years ahead.

It estimated the global aviation carbon offsetting scheme, known as CORSIA, which most airlines are a part of, could cost the airline around $150 million by 2030.

CORSIA requires airlines to purchase credits if their emissions exceed 85% of their 2019 levels, with the goal of offsetting the climate impact of growing international air travel.

In its report, the airline flagged its scope 1 emissions, which are mainly made up of fuel, as the main driver of future compliance costs.

Singapore Airlines pointed to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as a long-term solution. SAF can reduce emissions by around 65% compared to traditional jet fuel, according to the sector. The airline called SAF “a critical lever for decarbonisation” and said it would continue to support its development and use.

Managing Climate Risks

The airline said that other climate-related risks, such as extreme weather and infrastructure threats, currently have a limited financial impact.

However, it estimated that direct costs from these risks could reach up to around $35 million by 2030.

As part of its preparations, Singapore Airlines said it has invested in flood prevention measures at Singapore Changi Airport, including flood barriers and new drain sensors.

Skift contacted Singapore Airlines for additional comment on its climate strategy and financial forecasts, but the company did not respond.

Redefining aviation Otto Aviation has raised nearly $200 million for the Phantom 3500 and is about to launch a B Series funding round.","Otto Aviation (Fort Worth, Texas, U.S.) has launched the Phantom 3500 business jet. Touted as “the first true aircraft of the sustainability era,” the aircraft reportedly offers up to 60% lower fuel burn and 90% less emissions when using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) compared to similar-sized jets (such as the Bombardier Challenger 3500 or Embraer Praetor 500 and 600). This is partly due to its design, achieving transonic super-laminar flow with the help of AI-supported aerodynamics and a seamless composite fuselage. Also enabling the aircraft’s sustainability is the Williams International (Pontiac, Mich., U.S.) FJ44-4 QPM engine, which can use 100% SAF and integrates the auxiliary power unit (APU).

The Phantom 3500’s design will further reduce aerodynamic drag and also improve fuselage integrity by eliminating windows. Instead, HD display panels will offer what CEO Paul Touw describes as a “super natural infotainment system” that eliminates glare and augments the view from every seat, including a synthetic environment similar to Google Earth and streaming of movies that “goes way beyond just a window.”

As explained on the Otto Aviation website by Matt Thurber, editor-in-chief of Aviation International News (AIN), the Phantom 3500 airframe is all-composite, and Leonardo (Rome, Italy) will build the fuselage at its facility in Grottaglie, Italy.

The Phantom 3500 will offer seating for nine with a cabin height of 6 feet 5 inches (~2 meters) and is designed to cruise at over 600 miles per hour with a range of up to 3,500 nautical miles at altitudes of 51,000 feet. Operating costs are expected to be half those of other super-midsize jets.

Otto Aviation announced it will build the aircraft at Cecil Airport in Jacksonville, Florida, investing $430 million and relocating its headquarters to the site. Initial flight tests are planned for early 2027, with certification and entry into service expected by 2030.

Development history, laminar flow design

According to Thurber’s article, Otto Aviation has been working on the Phantom 3500 for 3 years, moving forward from its previous development of the Celera 500 aircraft. By January 2025, the company had completed the Phantom 3500’s conceptual design and systems requirement review. It then began announcing suppliers, including Advanced Integration Technology (AIT, Plano, Texas, U.S.) as its tooling and automation partner for production systems. AIT will provide assembly and joining systems, metrology tools and scalable automation cells.

Thurber also reports the Phantom 3500 design is supported by $25 million worth of wind tunnel testing, according to Touw. This includes wing cross-section tests at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California and high-speed tests at the European Transonic Windtunnel (ETW, Cologne, Germany). All of the tests were successful, says Touw, noting the company’s drag predictions and ETW results were within a couple of percent, giving confirmation of the super-laminar flow design.

“Natural laminar flow allows us to make the wing bigger without the consequence of more drag,” Touw notes in Thurber’s article. “Because of that big wing, we can take off and land out of shorter runways than a Challenger 3500 or Praetor 500/600 or Cessna Latitude or Longitude. The aircraft is also lighter… so the airplane’s wing tanks get smaller, the landing gear gets smaller, the engines are smaller, the structure is smaller. So per pound, it’s also less expensive to manufacture.”

According to Touw, the Phantom 3500’s wing is swept 23° and will have leading-edge slots that help to keep almost 90% of the wing in laminar flow. With this reduction in skin friction drag, the wing can then be larger, able to fly higher with lower wing loading compared to most business jets. Otto Aviation has not yet announced who will build the composite wing.

Touw expects to complete the Phantom 3500’s preliminary design review in October 2025 and then begin building the first of four test vehicles required for certification. First flight is currently scheduled for 2027. The single-pilot jet will be certified under FAR Part 23 regulations, anticipated in 2030.

Production facility, RTM versus SQRTM

Currently located at Meacham Field in Fort Worth, Texas, Otto Aviation has announced it will build a factory in Jacksonville, Florida. Thurber reports the company plans to rely on RTM to produce its carbon fiber-reinforced composite airframe, noting that Airbus uses a similar process to manufacture major structural components for the A220.

Actually, the process used to make the A220 wings is resin transfer infusion (RTI) which was first developed at the old Shorts Brothers facility in Belfast, Northern Ireland, by Bombardier for its C Series 100-150 seat commercial jetliner. That aircraft is now the Airbus A220, while the Belfast facility was later sold to Spirit AeroSystems (see CW’s plant tour) but is now part of Airbus.

Another important note is that the Otto Aviation website actually specifies SQRTM (same qualified resin transfer molding). As explained in “SQRTM enables net-shape parts” and “... combines prepreg with RTM,” this process uses a prepreg layup instead of a dry fabric preform, with the RTM process injecting the same resin that is used in the prepreg, but in liquid form. It thus avoids the need for qualifying new materials and should help speed certification yet still enable automation and aerospace-grade quality control. Note that RTM has been qualified for a number of flying parts, including the LEAP engine fan blades and fan case and the A320 spoilers, as well as the structural grid for the A350 passenger door and the A350 horizontal tail plane (HTP) leading edge produced by Aernnova ICSA.

Thurber says Touw admits that the tooling needed to manufacture the Phantom 3500 will be expensive. However, he believes eliminating labor involved with metal manufacturing (cutting, drilling and riveting) will be more efficient and that robotic manufacturing will also help to keep costs down.

Redefining aviation

Otto Aviation has raised nearly $200 million for the Phantom 3500 and is about to launch a B Series funding round. Thurber predicts the program could require more than $1 billion to reach certification and production. The company currently employs about 100 people and supports another 200 full-time-equivalent contractors.",https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0625-cw-news-phantom3500.jpg;maxWidth=1200,N,,2025-06-27 15:06:12.484421

The Senate's proposed tax and budget reconciliation legislation would modify the '45Z' Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit to restore tax parity between sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other advanced biofuels like biodiesel and renewable diesel effective Oct. 1, 2025. Modifying '45Z' to be technology-neutral marks a critical step in revitalizing U.S. biofuel production, which has dropped sharply since the credit took effect in January.

""We give the Senate a lot of credit for reconfiguring '45Z' to be truly technology neutral. SAF should be incentivized at the same rate as all other biofuels. An equal incentive – 'parity' – will result in more gallons of biofuel being produced and consumed, all at a lower cost for taxpayers,"" said David Fialkov, Executive Vice President of Government Affairs for NATSO and SIGMA. ""Importantly, this provision reduces the overall cost of the '45Z' tax credit while also incentivizing more over the road fuel production – helping to lower prices for consumers. A win for everyone.""

""A level playing field for sustainable aviation fuels versus over-the-road biofuels is critical to restoring the biodiesel market,"" said Matt Durand, NACS Deputy General Counsel. ""Today, the biodiesel market is failing due to tax policy. Unless we act to ensure biodiesel is no longer disadvantaged, the market may never recover. NACS strongly supports the Section '45Z' parity proposal and urges the Senate to retain it.""

The Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provided a higher tax credit of up to $1.75 for Sustainable Aviation Fuel production. The higher aviation fuel tax credit signed into law by President Biden, coupled with the expiration of the Biodiesel Blenders' Tax Credit at the end of 2024, has decimated America's advanced biofuel supply chains.

Equal tax treatment between alternative biofuels represents a significant step toward the much-needed certainty that will encourage biofuel production and consumption. SAF is more costly than biodiesel and renewable diesel and results in the production of less gallons of overall fuel. Under the Senate legislation, SAF would have access to the same credit as all other fuels and producers will be able to gravitate toward the most efficient fuels in the market.

SEA biodiesel industry seeks funds to decarbonise

Singapore, 27 June (Argus) — Regional biodiesel associations from Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia called for stakeholder support to further decarbonisation goals during the 5th Palm Biodiesel Conference in Bangkok over 23-24 June. Thai electrification shift competes with biodiesel industry Thailand has been driving a shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) under the 30@30 policy, targeting at least 30pc of total motor vehicles produced annually by 2030 to be EVs, while support for biodiesel producers is waning, said Thai biodiesel producer association Chairman Sanin Triyanond. Thailand will no longer subsidise the price of biofuels such as biodiesel under the oil fund act after 24 September 2026, said Supatchalee Sophonthammaphat, an official with the Thai department of alternative energy development and efficiency (DEDE). Triyanond called for both the EV and biodiesel industries to coexist, citing a study that said an EV and biofuel energy mix was recommended for the country. A low biodiesel blend target in Thailand resulted in only 30pc of Thailand's 11.7mn l/d in installed biodiesel capacity being utilised, and high operating costs across its 14 registered companies, Triyanond said. When domestic crude palm oil (CPO) stocks fall below 200,000t, local prices also increase in comparison to the global price, he added. This raises the cost of production when biodiesel producers import CPO as it is subject to 143pc import tax and exempt from export duties in Thailand. Thailand manages CPO supplies and prices by altering its volumetric blend target for biodiesel under the alternative energy development plan (AEDP). However, the biodiesel industry has been struggling with a low blending policy and feels that the stock management program needs to be redesigned to better support producers. Indonesia needs more investment to hit B50 biodiesel blend goal Indonesia is targeting 15.6mn kl of domestic biodiesel consumption in 2025 and has been conducting road tests for a higher B50 biodiesel blend with fossil diesel this year. To meet higher biodiesel blend ratios in subsequent years, new investment from the private sector and policy support from the government on pricing, funding and legislation is needed to drive infrastructure upgrades and capacity expansions, said deputy of promotion and communication at the Indonesian biofuels producer association (APROBI) Ravi Farkhan Pratama. For suppliers, complex logistics resulting in higher costs for transporting biodiesel to remote regions remain, said manager of biofuel and additive supply chain at PT Pertamina Patra Niaga Adi Rachman. A price disparity between public service obligation (PSO) and non-PSO (NPSO) biodiesel blends in the market poses a challenge in ensuring each fuel is supplied to the right customer group, he added. The PSO sector includes state-owned firms that serve the public. Fuel suppliers in this sector receive subsidies from the oil plantation fund management agency (BPDPKS) to fund the difference between palm oil-based biodiesel and the indexed price of diesel, while non-PSO fuel suppliers do not. Biodiesel plants in Indonesia have been running at an average 80pc of Indonesia's 20.9mn kl/yr installed capacity across 24 producers this year, said Pratama. Indonesia consumed about 20pc of annual CPO production under the B35 blend mandate in 2024. This year's B40 biodiesel blend mandate could eat into exports and other avenues including food use, Pratama added. Any further increase to blending mandates would exacerbate how palm supplies are distributed between food and fuel. There are also additional costs around infrastructure upgrades such as coating pipelines and storage tanks, said Rachman. A move to a B50 blend mandate would likely happen in 2027 or later, said head of B40 road test and B40 commercial test team at LEMIGAS research and development center of oil & gas technology, ministry of energy and mineral resources Cahyo Setyo Wibowo at the event. Malaysian biodiesel producers push for higher blending mandates Malaysia's B20 biodiesel blend mandate set in January 2020 has been limited to Pulau Langkawi, Kedah, Labuan and Sarawak in the transport sector. A separate 7pc biodiesel blend is required in the industrial sector, first mandated in July 2019. President of Malaysian biodiesel association Tee Lip Teng sought a nationwide B20 implementation for on-road fuels, and a B30 blend ratio by 2030. However, Tee said that a capital expenditure of more than 600mn ringgit ($142mn) would be required to achieve a full B20 nameplate biodiesel production capacity in Malaysia. On the other hand, the country is set to introduce a carbon tax as early as next year, allowing palm oil methyl ester (PME) prices to be more competitive, he added. Lower palm oil prices in relation to gasoil amid oil market uncertainty and during the upcoming peak palm production season could also drive voluntary blending. But fossil diesel continues to be subsidised for qualified businesses in the transportation and logistics sector, increasing the funding burden needed to subsidise PME in these sectors. While PME production continues to face challenges, Tee cited the potential to expand waste-based biodiesel production in Malaysia. Biodiesel exports out of Malaysia rose up to 2019 before declining afterward due to the EU ban on palm-based biofuels, Tee said. Majority of the biodiesel exported now comprises used cooking oil methyl ester (Ucome) and palm oil mill effluent oil methyl ester (Pomeme) rather than PME, he added. First generation biodiesel producers should be incentivised through government grants to retrofit their plants to use waste-based oils to complement their existing palm oil feedstock, Tee said. Other alternative feedstocks carrying a lower levelized cost of production such as palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) should be considered as a feedstock of choice, said general manager for strategy and sustainability at Petronas Dagangan Berhad Ms. Harlina Pikri.

Australian oil seed tree carbon credits to aid biofuels

Sydney, 27 June (Argus) — A potential inclusion of oil seed tree harvesting into the remake of an expiring Australian Carbon Credit Unit (ACCU) method could bring much-anticipated support to Australia's nascent biofuels sector. Australia's Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) has recently advised industry proponents to investigate the potential of adding oil seed harvesting to the remake of the Reforestation and Afforestation 2.0 method, US agricultural innovation firm Terviva senior manager of commercialisation Kevin Swanepoel told Argus on 27 June. The method credits emission reductions to forest growers and landholders who establish and maintain trees on land previously used for agricultural purposes. It will expire on 30 September 2025, and Terviva and its partner, Japanese refiner Idemitsu Kosan, will participate in the consultation processes around a potential remake of the method. Idemitsu and Terviva, alongside Australian mining company Stanmore Resources, have been working on a trial plantation of pongamia trees in Queensland. The companies are eyeing the crop as a potential feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). They are also exploring the use of pressed pongamia oilseed cake as livestock feed, as well as the potential creation of ACCUs from the carbon sequestration of the trees. The firms ultimately aim to convert the carbon sequestration benefits of pongamia into ACCUs, Idemitsu said in a separate statement. But no approved methodology currently exists within the ACCU framework to support this pathway, the firm added. Proponent-led pathway The industry had high expectations about an expression of interest submitted by mining firm Rio Tinto in 2024 for the creation of an ACCU method under the new proponent-led model . The proposed ""Sequestration of Carbon from Oil Seed Trees"" method would involve planting perennial oil seed tree species and crediting the carbon sequestration associated with living biomass and potentially soil carbon. The proposal would use pongamia as an example species, with other oil seed species to be included over time. The oil seeds resulting from these plantations would be harvested and used in biofuel production. The Emission Reduction Assurance Committee (Erac) considered the proposal to have ""excellent alignment"" and deemed it ""ready for imminent development"", but noted support for development would come only ""if or when resources permit"". The Australian government prioritised four other methods instead, but said expressions of interest could be re-submitted in the next rounds under the proponent-led pathway. The DCCEEW did not reply to questions on when the next round will be opened or whether there would be a minimum or maximum number of methods to be prioritised. Industry participants said no dates have been indicated by the government. Options outside the proponent-led route Rio Tinto also did not comment on its next steps for the proponent-led pathway, although it has been progressing with a pilot study to explore the potential of pongamia seed oil as a feedstock for renewable diesel output . The pilot, in partnership with Australian wood-fibre processor and exporter Midway, involved the acquisition of approximately 3,000 hectares of land in north Queensland and the planting of pongamia saplings. Support is required to incentivise the production and use of biofuels at scale to grow the industry in Australia, Rio Tinto said in 2024 in a paper about diesel transition. One of the options would be creating pathways for renewable diesel farming projects to be recognised under the ACCU scheme. ""This could serve the dual purpose of supporting development of Australia's biofuels industry , while expanding ACCU supply to help meet expected demand from facilities under the safeguard mechanism ,"" it added. Remaking expiring methods offers the government the opportunity to add new activities to be credited under the ACCU scheme outside the proponent-led route, Midway carbon projects manager John Lawson said. The reforestation and afforestation method has a limited number of projects over its history, so adding seed oil crops and harvest activities could improve uptake of the method with minimal changes to the method required, he added. ""There is a growing group of project developers interested in and actively working on options for implementing changes like these,"" he said.

Mexico’s trade balance swings to surplus in May

Mexico City, 26 June (Argus) — Mexico's trade balance returned to surplus territory in May, as higher crude export volumes helped to offset drags on manufacturing from US tariffs. Mexico recorded a $1.03bn trade surplus in May, statistics agency Inegi reported Thursday, swinging from a $88mn deficit the previous month. Total exports in May were valued at $55.5bn, while imports reached $54.4bn. The surplus was wider than Mexican bank Banorte's forecast of $279mn. The balance reflects the trade deficit in oil-related products narrowing to $2.11bn in May from $2.87bn in April, as well as a rebounding surplus in non-oil trade to $3.14bn from $2.78bn in April. Mexico ran a $2.04bn trade surplus for the January-May period, including a $10.96bn surplus in non-oil trade and a $8.92bn deficit in oil-related trade. This reflects the longer-term trend of growing non-oil exports set against widening deficits of oil-related goods. Manufacturing exports — especially autos — have been the most affected by US tariffs enacted in March and April. Despite US exemptions tied to trade treaties, Mexico still faces an average effective US tariff rate of 11.9pc — the eighth highest globally and the highest in the western hemisphere, according to Fitch Ratings. The auto industry is also participating in negotiations to soften steel and aluminum tariffs to prevent further supply chain disruptions. Manufacturing exports fell by 0.6pc in May after a 0.7pc drop in April. Auto exports declined by 1.3pc in May, following a 4.8pc fall in April. Inegi reported a 10.3pc annual drop in the value of auto exports to the US in May, after an 8pc decline in April. Exports had surged 6.5pc in March as companies rushed shipments ahead of tariff implementation. Agricultural exports contracted by 2.6pc in May from the previous month after rising 2pc in April, while non-oil mining exports contracted 2.9pc after surging 26pc in April. Oil-related exports totaled $2.06bn in May — $1.33bn in crude and $722mn in refined products — compared with $1.83bn in crude alone in April. This comes despite a stronger peso and lower oil prices. Mexico's crude export mix averaged $57.88/bl in May, down $2.94/bl from April and $16.51/bl below the year-earlier level. Crude export volumes rose to 743,000 b/d from 693,000 b/d in April but remained below the 930,000 b/d exported in May 2024.

US reps resist Senate approach to biofuel credit

New York, 26 June (Argus) — A coalition of US House members is pushing the Senate to scrap planned changes to a tax credit that the biofuel industry sees as crucial for profitable production. Republicans in both chambers have looked to use a fillibuster-proof budget bill to keep but modify the Inflation Reduction Act's ""45Z"" tax credit, which increases subsidies for fuels with lower emissions. But some farm-state House members are displeased with the Senate's approach , including less-punitive treatment of foreign feedstocks and substantial cuts to subsidies for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). ""We respectfully urge you and your committee to revise the language around 45Z to reflect the House language,"" seven House Republicans, including three on the House tax-writing committee, wrote Wednesday in a letter to Senate Finance Committee chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho). Both the House and Senate bills would prevent tax officials from factoring in indirect emissions from land use changes, a win for crop-based fuels like corn ethanol, and would extend 45Z four more years through 2031. But the House bill, which passed the chamber narrowly last month, would also strip eligibility from fuels derived from feedstocks outside North America starting next year. The Senate Finance draft, on the other hand, cuts subsidies for fuels from foreign feedstocks by 20pc while still allowing them some credit. The issue is highly contentious across the biofuel supply chain. Farm groups say that recently fast-rising imports of used cooking oil and tallow are hurting demand for domestic crops that can also be refined into renewable diesel. Refiners insist that flexibility around feedstocks is essential for scaling up biofuel output. The House lawmakers say that the Senate language would ""subsidize imported feedstocks"", some of which come from countries that ""actively discriminate against our domestic biofuels industry"". The House letter also asks the Senate to retain additional subsidies for SAF, which they say are critical given the fuel's typically higher cost of production. Under current law, road fuels are eligible for up to $1/USG and SAF up to $1.75/USG, plus inflation adjustments for all types of fuel — but the Senate Finance draft would eliminate that jet fuel premium. Notably, the House lawmakers say they prefer the Senate's more lenient approach to tax credit ""transferability"", which allows smaller companies without enough tax liability to instead sell tax credits to other businesses. President Donald Trump has pushed lawmakers to send him the budget bill before 4 July, but lawmakers still disagree on key details with just days before that self-imposed deadline. Along with fighting over energy policy, some conservatives are wary of the package's potential impact on the federal budget deficit and want more sweeping cuts to government spending. The letter was signed by representatives Michelle Fischbach (R-Minnesota), Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa), Max Miller (R-Ohio), Zach Nunn (R-Iowa), Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa), Brad Finstad (R-Minnesota) and Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa).

In a significant step forward, Michigan has introduced a state-level incentive program aimed at jumpstarting local SAF production. The new legislation—supported by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle—offers targeted tax credits for producers and blenders that can meet stringent emissions and sustainability criteria.

The program is part of a broader shift toward state-led climate and energy action, as federal direction under the Trump administration remains uncertain. While the Michigan initiative establishes a modest tax credit cap of $4.5 million in its first year, it lays the groundwork for regional market development—an essential piece of a national SAF strategy still waiting for clearer federal support.

SAF: A Scalable, Drop-in Solution

SAF is derived from renewable or waste-based feedstocks—such as agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon—and can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 50% compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. It’s also compatible with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure, enabling airlines to cut emissions without significant capital investment.

But production volumes remain limited. While U.S. airlines have committed to bold SAF procurement targets, the supply chain is still in early stages of scale-up. This is where state action becomes critical.

Industry Expands Despite Federal Policy Ambiguity

Across the U.S., SAF producers continue to ramp up operations:

World Energy is expanding its Paramount, CA facility to become one of the largest SAF hubs in North America, aiming for 250 million gallons per year.

Gevo Inc. is building its Net-Zero 1 facility in South Dakota, expected to produce 60 million gallons of SAF annually with the help of carbon capture and renewable energy.

LanzaJet, headquartered in Illinois, is completing its Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Georgia with support from Microsoft and the U.S. Department of Energy.

Neste has expanded its U.S. footprint with SAF supply agreements at San Francisco and Los Angeles airports and a new Houston terminal.

Honeywell UOP and Chevron continue to scale up SAF production through co-processing infrastructure.

Trump Administration: Mixed Signals on SAF

Federal support, however, has become less consistent under the current administration. In February 2025, the Department of Energy (DOE) approved a $1.44 billion loan guarantee for Montana Renewables to expand its SAF facility in Great Falls—signaling at least some support for the sector. But that move contrasts with broader federal inaction:

On his first day in office, President Trump froze funding for numerous climate and energy programs, including clean energy tax incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This freeze has placed the future of SAF-related federal tax credits in limbo, creating deep uncertainty for developers and investors.

The administration has also rebranded SAF as ""synthetic aviation fuel"" in public documents—a rhetorical shift some interpret as a pivot toward domestic fossil-based alternatives.

While Trump has praised SAF as an economic boon for rural America and farmers, especially those producing corn and soy feedstocks, critics note the absence of any cohesive SAF strategy or commitment to lifecycle GHG accounting standards.

This has created what many in the industry describe as a “policy vacuum” at the federal level—one that is now being filled by states like Michigan, California, and Illinois.

What’s Next for SAF in the U.S.?

As SAF production technologies mature and airline demand continues to rise, the question is not whether the U.S. will expand its SAF market—but how quickly and under what regulatory structure. States that proactively support SAF may gain a competitive edge in attracting clean energy investment and positioning their airports as hubs for low-emissions travel.

With uncertainty clouding the future of federal tax credits and lifecycle emissions standards, industry players are increasingly turning to state programs, private capital, and long-term offtake agreements to derisk investments.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250625-172807-49c-A%20modern%20aircraft%20flying%20over%20green%20fields%20with%20a%20biofuel%20facility%20in%20the%20foreground%2C%20symbolizing%20sustainable%20aviation..jpg,N,,2025-06-27 13:09:57.065696

Concerns about a potential oversupply in the market have also emerged due to higher palm oil stockpiles and increased production.
On Thursday, palm oil prices closed at 4,020 Malaysian ringgits ($951) per tonne, a dip from last week’s highs that were influenced by tensions between Israel and Iran and a nearly 20% surge in crude oil prices.","Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer of palm oil, is reportedly considering increasing the amount of palm oil used in its biofuels, a move that would mirror the policies of top producer Indonesia, according to industry sources, reports The Hindu Businessline.

Currently, Malaysia requires a 10% palm oil blend (B10) for transport fuels and a 20% blend (B20) for industrial use. In contrast, Indonesia has a more aggressive policy, mandating a 40% palm oil blend in its biodiesel.

Malaysia is also actively researching and developing palm-based aviation fuel, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and advanced biofuels. This strategy aligns with the nation’s climate goals and efforts to diversify its palm oil market. Industry insiders suggest that rising crude oil prices, often triggered by global political tensions, tend to boost interest in biofuels as an alternative energy source. This could lead to increased demand for palm-based biofuels in regions like Southeast Asia, India, and West Asia, spanning both transportation and industrial energy sectors.

The potential for higher biofuel demand alongside existing food security concerns presents a complex challenge for the global community.

Malaysia’s approach is consistent with that of other nations, such as the United States, which has reportedly proposed allowing refineries to blend a record amount of biofuel into gasoline and diesel next year. Brazil also recently decided to raise its biodiesel blend in diesel from 14% to 15%, effective August 1.

However, a cap on edible oil prices has been observed due to weaker immediate demand from major buyers like India, with signs suggesting that India’s soybean oil imports might decrease.

Concerns about a potential oversupply in the market have also emerged due to higher palm oil stockpiles and increased production. On Thursday, palm oil prices closed at 4,020 Malaysian ringgits ($951) per tonne, a dip from last week’s highs that were influenced by tensions between Israel and Iran and a nearly 20% surge in crude oil prices.

While Malaysia’s B20 biodiesel blend is currently in use only in specific areas, the Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities noted in February 2025 that significant funding for infrastructure improvements would be needed to expand the B20 program nationwide. The industry is generally hoping for government financial support, but the government currently has no plans to provide it.

Malaysia introduced its National Biodiesel Programme in 2019, making B10 mandatory for the transport sector and B7 for the manufacturing sector in the same year. However, the B20 program has yet to be fully implemented across the country, being limited to areas such as Labuan, Langkawi, and parts of Sarawak in East Malaysia.

Malaysia exports biodiesel primarily to the European Union (which accounts for over 80% of its biodiesel exports), China, and Singapore, according to the Malaysian Biodiesel Association.

While some in the industry are optimistic about the future of biodiesel and partnerships with private companies, others remain cautious due to price instability. Indonesia’s mandatory B40 biodiesel program, for instance, led to tighter global supplies and made palm oil more expensive than competing oils like soybean oil.

As a result, palm oil’s share in India’s total edible oil imports dropped to 43% (from 58% in the previous year) during the first seven months of the 2024-25 oil year. However, Malaysian palm oil industry leaders view this decline as a temporary market trend, influenced by India’s domestic policies supporting oilseed expansion and diversification of edible oil sources.

Malaysian palm oil production is predicted to see a moderate increase in 2025 and 2026, thanks to better weather, replanting with higher-yielding crops, and improved harvesting efficiency through machinery and advanced technology. However, challenges like labor shortages and unpredictable weather patterns, along with slow adoption of new technology, could limit productivity gains.

“We anticipate prices to remain moderately strong into 2026 due to global political tensions affecting edible oil supply chains, fluctuating prices of rival oilseeds like soybean oil and sunflower oil, currency movements, and biofuel mandates,” the source stated. “However, uncertainties in demand from major importing countries might cause short-term price swings.” Palm oil production is particularly sensitive to weather and labor availability, which can lead to more frequent price changes.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Palm-Oil.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 15:06:21.087251

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has unveiled a groundbreaking platform designed to connect airlines with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers, a key step in accelerating the industry’s transition to more environmentally friendly fuels. The initiative, known as the SAF Matchmaker, is part of a broader effort to increase the availability and use of SAF within the aviation sector, which is pivotal in meeting global sustainability goals.

Bridging the Gap for SAF Procurement

The SAF Matchmaker platform is designed to simplify the procurement process for SAF by providing a centralized hub where airlines can easily find and connect with SAF suppliers. The platform streamlines the procurement process, reducing both the complexity and costs often associated with sourcing SAF. It aims to ensure a more efficient, transparent, and accessible SAF market, which is critical to meeting the aviation sector’s ambitious goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The platform functions as a matchmaking tool, allowing airlines to post requests for SAF while suppliers can offer their available quantities of the fuel. When a match is made, the parties can move their negotiations offline to finalize details such as price and payment terms. Initially, the SAF Matchmaker is available only to airlines and SAF suppliers but is expected to expand in the future to include buyers from non-aviation sectors as well.

Enhancing SAF Market Connectivity

IATA’s SAF Matchmaker addresses three core challenges currently facing the aviation industry in its pursuit of greater SAF adoption: efficiency, connectivity, and visibility. By providing a platform where all stakeholders can connect without additional fees, the initiative aims to expedite the procurement process, making it faster and more straightforward.

The SAF Matchmaker enhances connectivity by allowing SAF producers to post information on available or planned volumes of fuel. Airlines, in turn, can register their interest in purchasing specific SAF quantities. The platform also allows users to access detailed information about the available SAF, including its feedstock, location, technology used in production, emissions reductions, and compliance with major environmental frameworks such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

Facilitating a Sustainable Future for Aviation

The SAF Matchmaker platform is part of a larger strategy to build a fully functioning market for sustainable aviation fuel. This platform aims to reduce the barriers to SAF adoption by improving transparency and facilitating smoother connections between airlines and suppliers. By doing so, it plays a crucial role in driving the growth of the voluntary SAF purchasing market, which is essential for the aviation industry’s sustainability goals.

The Current Landscape of SAF Adoption

Sustainable aviation fuel has been slowly gaining traction in the aviation sector since its first use in a commercial flight back in 2008. While SAF still accounts for less than 1% of global aviation fuel consumption, demand has been steadily increasing. In 2023, SAF consumption surged to more than 600 million liters, doubling the previous year’s figures. With a robust growth trajectory, production is expected to exceed 2.7 billion liters in 2025, more than double the 1.3 billion liters anticipated for 2024.

This rapid growth underscores the momentum behind SAF adoption and highlights the crucial role that platforms like the SAF Matchmaker play in enabling airlines to source sustainable fuel more easily and efficiently. By helping to streamline the procurement process, the SAF Matchmaker is set to become a key tool in supporting the aviation sector’s transition to a more sustainable future.

Looking to the Future of SAF

The SAF Matchmaker platform is a significant step forward in the effort to scale up the use of sustainable aviation fuel. As the global aviation industry works towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, initiatives like this one are essential in creating a more sustainable and resilient fuel market. The platform not only simplifies the process of buying and selling SAF but also provides crucial visibility and transparency, making it easier for airlines to make informed decisions about their fuel supply.

With increasing demand and production of SAF, the aviation industry is on a clear path to a greener, more sustainable future. The SAF Matchmaker platform is poised to play a pivotal role in driving this transformation by ensuring that airlines have access to the fuel they need to meet their sustainability targets while reducing their environmental footprint.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__71596-38.jpeg,N,,2025-06-27 11:09:19.945770

In a revolutionary move, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced the release of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform, to facilitate SAF procurement between airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with offers.

Under the new facility, when there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

Specifically, the SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues – efficiency, connectivity and visibility.

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA Senior VP Sustainability and Chief Economist.

The SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as offtake agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only. In due course, other SAF buyers such as non-aviation corporations will also be able to participate.

The SAF Matchmaker is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, a centralized digital space designed to provide the aviation industry with access to practical tools that support aviation energy management.

ATR designs and manufactures turboprop aircraft used by regional airlines across the globe.","Something unusually precise is unfolding beneath the surface of regional aviation, an effort not aimed at headlines but at dismantling the logistical and regulatory blocks that have kept cleaner fuels out of everyday service. It’s not about pledges or posturing, but execution.

ATR, the long-established manufacturer of regional turboprops, has entered a targeted partnership with ATOBA Energy designed to make sustainable aviation fuel a realistic option for smaller airlines. Announced at the Paris Airshow, the agreement addresses a core issue often overlooked in broader aviation decarbonisation plans: the structural barriers preventing SAF adoption outside major hubs.

Regional carriers have faced a unique set of constraints. While SAF offers up to 80 per cent lifecycle emissions reduction, its availability remains patchy, its cost high, and its delivery infrastructure concentrated in a few locations. ATR’s collaboration with ATOBA tackles these challenges head-on through a dual approach, improving physical access to SAF at regional airports and embedding flexible systems for tracking and claiming its environmental impact.

The technical innovation lies in combining direct fuel logistics with a “book-and-claim” accounting model. This system, in line with internationally recognised emissions frameworks, allows airlines to take credit for SAF emissions savings even when the fuel is not delivered directly to their location. It’s a model designed to scale, offering immediate environmental benefits without waiting for infrastructure to catch up.

For ATR, this initiative isn’t a side project. It forms part of its broader 2030 goal to make its aircraft fully SAF-capable. That commitment requires more than engine adaptations, it demands a full ecosystem capable of supporting SAF uptake across a fragmented and globally dispersed user base. By working with ATOBA, a specialist in SAF aggregation and distribution, ATR is putting commercial practicality at the centre of its decarbonisation strategy.

The implications are significant. While much of the aviation sector’s sustainability conversation is dominated by large carriers and long-haul routes, regional aviation accounts for a vast number of daily flights across diverse geographies, many of them underserved by current fuel systems. Bringing SAF into these markets not only reduces emissions at scale, it also introduces consistency into a space that’s often left behind in regulatory frameworks.

What makes this approach notable from an investor perspective is its blend of ambition and operational realism. ATR isn’t just responding to pressure; it’s building systems. Delivery chains, emissions attribution models, and technical integration platforms are all part of a replicable blueprint, one that other segments of the industry could adopt if proven effective.

Moreover, ATOBA’s role adds financial and structural depth. As a SAF aggregator, it brings the purchasing power and contracting stability smaller carriers often lack. Their ability to pool demand, secure long-term supply, and manage regulatory interfaces reduces friction and enhances the bankability of sustainable fuel solutions. Together, they’re creating the kind of framework that enables action, not just intention.

This project’s timing also matters. With regulators moving toward mandatory SAF targets and carbon accounting tightening, the ability to offer airlines a turnkey path to compliance becomes not just attractive, but essential. ATR is positioning itself not merely as an aircraft supplier, but as a partner in regulatory readiness—an enabler of futureproof operations in a constrained and competitive market.

The real value here is strategic optionality. Regional airlines typically have limited leverage in fuel sourcing and limited capital to navigate environmental compliance. By removing access barriers and embedding SAF capability into both aircraft and supply systems, ATR enhances the resilience and relevance of its product offering. Investors would do well to watch how this model performs, not just in emissions savings, but in market adoption and repeatability.

What ATR and ATOBA are building is more than a single programme; it’s a modular, standards-based framework for making SAF viable in regions where demand exists but access has stalled. If successful, it could form the basis for broader transitions, not only for ATR customers, but for regional aviation as a whole.

By aligning with ATOBA Energy to expand access to sustainable aviation fuel, it is creating a commercial and operational pathway for emissions reduction tailored specifically to smaller carriers operating in dispersed markets.",https://www.directorstalkinterviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Avation-plc.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 08:02:15.907363

Aviation fuel mandates, designed to propel the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), promise to reshape how the industry tackles climate challenges. But the path to achieving these goals is anything but straightforward.

The EU and UK are setting a precedent with their SAF mandates, requiring airlines to blend at least 2% of SAF into their jet fuel supply by 2025. At face value, the numbers sound achievable. Just over 1.2 million tonnes of SAF will be needed between the two regions. However, considering the EU’s jet fuel consumption hovers around 46 million tonnes annually and the UK at 11.9 million tonnes, the scale of transformation required is monumental.

But 2025’s mandate is just the start. The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation is targeting 6% SAF by 2030 and an ambitious 70% by 2050. Meanwhile, the UK is aiming for 10% by 2030, and while their trajectory is slightly different, the ultimate pressure to decarbonize is no less intense.

How, then, will these mandates be met? What hurdles might lie ahead for the aviation industry, and where do the opportunities begin to emerge?

The SAF production puzzle

New mandates aren’t just increasing SAF quotas but are also pushing for technologies like synthetic SAF and alternatives to the dominant HEFA pathway. While necessary for the long-term roadmap, these advancements come with their own cost and scalability concerns.

The move to SAF isn’t just about compliance, it’s an investment in resilience and innovation for the aviation industry.

She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

For example, a voluntary salary cut for the executives and the founding of the Budapest Airport Foundation, which supports blue collar workers who lost their job during the COVID-19 pandemic.

After being nominated to CEO position in March 2021, Dinsdale continues to work closely with the executive team to create a clear COVID-19 recovery strategy for Budapest Airport. This will also mean that we come out stronger of the pandemic and have a clear focus. Dinsdale is an inspiring true leader who helped us all to cope with the very difficult times of the pandemic and I am convinced that he truly deserves this award.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2025-06-19-153757.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 08:02:23.978878

A “matchmaker” platform that links airlines with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers has been launched by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

The initiative is aimed at boosting uptake of SAF within the aviation sector and comes as industry and government collaborates to increase its availability.

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market,” explained Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s SVP sustainability and chief economist.

“The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF.

“The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers.”

How does it work?

IATA’s SAF Matchmaker initiative provides a central platform for those seeking to buy and sell SAF.

Specifically, it helps facilitate SAF procurement between airline customers and the energy companies producing the fuel by matching requests for SAF supply with offers.

When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

Hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, the SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as off-take agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only.

In the future, other sustainable fuel buyers in non-aviation related industries are also expected to be able to use it.

Why is it needed?

IATA says the platform is needed to address three key challenges: efficiency, connectivity and visibility.

The airline association says it will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees.

This in turn will drive further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

IATA’s platform will enhance connectivity by enabling SAF producers and suppliers to post available or planned SAF volumes, while airlines will be able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes.

However any trade will be done away from the platform.

The platform also provides information regarding the available SAF, volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

How much SAF is currently being used?

Since the first flight powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) took off in 2008, demand for the low-carbon fuel has steadily grown.

To date, around 500,000 flights have used SAF blends.

While SAF still makes up less than 1% of global aviation fuel consumption, usage surged in 2023 to over 600 million litres, doubling the previous year.

The upward trajectory is expected to continue, with production forecast to exceed 2.7 billion litres in 2025, more than double the estimated 1.3 billion litres in 2024, highlighting the rapid scaling of the sector.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AdobeStock_675386331-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-06-27 08:02:34.012352

The announcement follows a meeting between Ecology Minister Aziz Abduhakimov and Haruki Yamasaki, CEO of Le One Co., Ltd, where both parties discussed joint efforts to implement an innovative environmental technology pilot.

Le One Co., Ltd has secured a $4 million grant from Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). The funding, awarded for the 2025–2030 period, is part of NEDO’s international program supporting advanced Japanese technologies that contribute to decarbonization and green energy transitions.

The project will involve the construction of a pilot plant in Uzbekistan that will convert organic waste into biogas and then into methane. In addition to generating renewable energy, the initiative aims to address environmental challenges by cutting greenhouse gas emissions, safely managing waste, producing biohumus for agriculture, and using advanced Japanese cleaning and purification technologies.

“This project promotes the use of biogas as an alternative energy source, reducing environmental impact while creating an efficient waste management system,” the ministry said in a statement. “The technology supports our broader goals of sustainable development and moving toward a low-carbon economy.”

The two parties agreed to prepare and sign a memorandum of understanding between Le One Co., Ltd and Uzbekistan’s Agency for Waste Management and Circular Economy. The document will define the responsibilities of both sides and serve as the foundation for the project’s launch.

Phillips 66 CEO Mark Lashier echoed the sentiment at another event this week.","U.S. refiner Phillips 66 has begun supplying British Airways with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for its flights out of California, with 5 million U.S. gallons already delivered in recent months. The fuel, produced at Phillips 66’s renewable fuels facility in Rodeo, California, has been sent monthly to Los Angeles International Airport since December, reports Argus.

The agreement strengthens British Airways’ efforts to reduce carbon emissions from aviation, although the deal’s pricing and future volumes remain undisclosed. Phillips 66 confirmed the ongoing monthly deliveries but did not elaborate further.

This deal follows a similar agreement announced last December, under which Phillips 66 began supplying SAF to United Airlines at airports in California and Illinois. The Rodeo refinery, which was converted primarily to renewable diesel production in early 2024, has since expanded its SAF output.

While the U.S. currently lacks mandates requiring the use of SAF—unlike the UK and European Union—it offers several financial incentives that support production. SAF producers in California can benefit from the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and a new federal clean fuel tax credit launched this year provides higher rewards for fuels that deliver greater emission reductions.

Phillips 66 produces SAF from a variety of domestic and international feedstocks, including vegetable oils, waste animal fats, and used cooking oil. The company is also exploring co-processing renewable feedstocks at its U.S. refineries, in addition to existing operations at its 221,000 b/d Humber refinery in the UK, where it has previously supplied SAF to British Airways.

Despite record SAF production in the U.S. this year, output of other biofuels like biodiesel and renewable diesel has declined. This drop is largely due to uncertainty surrounding future blending mandates and changes to the clean fuel tax credit.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration proposed record biofuel blend mandates but also suggested cutting credits for fuels made from imported feedstocks—common inputs at major coastal refineries. In Congress, both House and Senate Republicans have floated changes to the SAF tax credit, with a draft Senate bill proposing a future reduction in the extra incentive SAF receives compared to road fuels.

“Policy has been moving around, and that’s the real struggle,” said Brian Mandell, executive vice president of marketing and commercial at Phillips 66, speaking at the Reuters Global Energy Transition 2025 conference in New York.

Phillips 66 CEO Mark Lashier echoed the sentiment at another event this week. “Policy is getting clearer, but there’s still a lot of elements out there that we’re watching very carefully,” he said at the JP Morgan 2025 Energy, Power, Renewables, and Mining Conference.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-7.png,N,,2025-06-27 11:09:54.019750

If emissions from private jets represent such a small percentage of the total, why should we be concerned?
The U.S. states of Florida and Texas alone generated more private jet flights and emissions than the entire European Union.
In Europe, the gasoline put in cars is taxed, but jet fuel — whether for commercial or private flights — is not.","The battle against climate change is also a class struggle: the ultra-rich generate far more emissions, while the poorest suffer the worst consequences. A clear example is private jets, which are increasingly used despite being the most polluting means of transport. A study by the NGO International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), published this Friday, delves into this issue: each private jet generates, on average, as many greenhouse gases (GHG) per year as 177 cars or eight heavy trucks — while transporting far fewer people or goods.

The report shows that private aviation emitted as many emissions in 2023 — the latest data available — as all the flights departing from Heathrow Airport, the largest in Europe. The researchers also estimate that the 95 jets flying to Venice for Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s wedding will generate 5,000 tons of greenhouse gases.

In the report, the researchers identified 3.57 million private flights in 2023, with each aircraft emitting an average of 810 tons of GHG annually — equivalent to the emissions of 177 cars or nine heavy trucks. Dan Rutherford, one of the researchers, notes via email: “Private jets are a significant, and largely untaxed, source of GHG pollution. Given the wealth of their users, governments should consider taxing their emissions to generate revenue to support aviation decarbonization and climate change mitigation.”

Private aviation grew significantly in 2021 and 2022, coinciding with the reduction in commercial flights in the post-COVID era. According to the study’s authors, private jets emitted approximately 23.74 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) — the unit used to measure greenhouse gases — in 2022, representing almost 4% of total civil aviation emissions. In 2023, that figure dropped to 19.5 million tons of CO₂e, although it is 25% higher than the figure from 10 years ago. As the number of commercial flights increased, this figure represents a lower percentage of all aviation emissions (just over 2% of the total).

What could be the reason for this slight decline? According to the researcher, “the figures suggest that private aviation activity is more volatile than commercial aviation, perhaps because it is less profit-driven: airlines have a strong incentive to optimize the number of trips their planes make each year by adjusting prices; private planes are likely to simply remain parked when demand drops.” Furthermore, 2023 was the year in which conventional commercial air routes returned to pre-pandemic levels.

If emissions from private jets represent such a small percentage of the total, why should we be concerned? “It’s better to analyze this from an equity perspective,” Rutherford responds. “Climate damage falls most heavily on the poorest, especially in the Global South, while private aviation is used for discretionary travel by the ultra-rich, and is largely untaxed. It makes sense to tax private jets to raise revenue to support decarbonization and adaptation.”

The ICCT shows that in 2023, two-thirds of global private jet flights departed from U.S. airports, accounting for more than half (55%) of the estimated GHG emissions from these aircraft. France and the United Kingdom were a distant second and third, with 2.2% and 2.1% of flights, respectively. The U.S. states of Florida and Texas alone generated more private jet flights and emissions than the entire European Union.

Short private flights

The researchers note that private planes are typically used for relatively short distances: half of the flights covered distances less than 900 kilometers (560 miles), while 75% were less than 1,500 kilometers (932 miles). Flights of more than 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) accounted for only 5% of the total. The average flight time was 85 minutes (less than an hour and a half).

For this reason, the ICCT is calling for these flights to be replaced by high-speed trains on all possible routes, as train times are very competitive over short and medium distances. Furthermore, they are calling for governments to tighten fuel efficiency (CO₂) requirements for new private aircraft and to mandate the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) for these flights, as is already beginning to happen with commercial aviation.

In Europe, the gasoline put in cars is taxed, but jet fuel — whether for commercial or private flights — is not. For this reason, the organization is calling for taxes to be imposed on private jets, which would help generate revenue for climate financing “by targeting passengers who are ultra-wealthy and less price-sensitive, allowing tax rates to bridge the 2-5 times cost gap between conventional jet fuel and renewable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), without heavily impacting commercial aviation.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/6VV4IB3YVVETJIZYEGIMP262JI.jpg?auth=03d28cd3f59ddab68f1d8b1d00cf3ed6d380f3bb0c0d8bafeb25590dcd7b9918&width=1200,N,,2025-06-27 08:02:39.812940

The national carrier revealed the plan during the launch of its 2024 Sustainability Report on June 26 in Nairobi. CEO Allan Kilavuka said Kenya Airways signed a memorandum of understanding with a local SAF producer and identified degraded former mining land in Kwale County to grow trees for feedstock.

“We want to be part of production… We shall have to come up with a framework of manufacturing capacity not only for sale for export but also for our local consumption,” he said as quoted by The Standard.

Fuel accounts for 30–35% of Kenya Airways’ operational costs and 64% of its emissions.

“The cost of SAF is estimated currently to be around four to five times the cost of traditional jet fuel… someone has to pay for it, and that is the passenger,” Kilavuka said.

To support carbon offsetting, the airline has planted 1.2mn trees and plans to maintain that number annually. The move supports climate goals under CORSIA and Africa’s Agenda 2063.

Kenya Airways’ plan aligns with a global shift towards SAF amid growing climate pressures. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF demand could reach 17mn tonnes annually by 2030, representing 4–5% of total jet fuel use. Yet current supply accounts for less than 0.2%, with minimal contribution from Africa.

Kilavuka said the airline, which is 48.9% owned by the Kenyan government, 38.1% by a consortium of local banks, and 7.8% by Air France–KLM, has also deployed 12 electric ground units and is working with the African Airlines Association to optimise routes.

He also highlighted KQ’s progress on gender inclusion. “As we talk right now, eight percent of our pilots are women,” Kilavuka said.

Principal Secretaries Festus Ng’eno and Teresia Mbaika praised the national carrier’s efforts, including its SAF initiative, emissions cuts, and commitment to the Fly Kenyan Policy.

In May 2023, it became the first African airline to use SAF on a long-haul flight. Kenya Airways also operates a pyrodiesel plant converting plastic waste.

What is Aviation Fuel?

What Aviation fuel refers to any fuel used to power airplanes or aeroplanes, primarily Jet A, Jet A-1, Jet B, and aviation gasoline (avgas). The chemical formula, composition, autoignition temperature, and flash point vary depending on the type. These properties are key to ensuring safe engine performance under extreme conditions.

Types of Aviation Fuel

Jet A/Jet A-1: Widely used in turbine engines. Jet A-1 is common in international operations due to its lower freezing temperature.

Jet B: A naphtha-kerosene blend suitable for cold climates. It is nearly clear and can be described as straw-colored.

Avgas (aviation gasoline): Used in small piston-engine aircraft; it contains lead and comes in different colors of aviation fuel (e.g., blue for 100LL).

Cryogenic Fuels: Including hydrogen fuel, being explored for future emissions-free flights.

Diesel: An emerging alternative, especially for use in smaller aircraft.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): A type of biofuel made from renewable sources, which aims to reduce carbon emissions.

Sustainable (and Alternative) Aviation Fuels

To reduce carbon emissions, biofuels such as carinata sustainable aviation fuel, non-oil seed crop sustainable aviation fuel, and non-food oilseed sustainable aviation fuel are being developed. These alternative fuels promise lower lifecycle emissions and can even be blended with traditional fuels.

The United States, India, and the EU are investing in SAF research and supply infrastructure. Airlines and FBOs (fixed-base operators) are increasingly participating in carbon offsetting programs.

General Aviation

Nearly every airport offers at least minimal services, primarily fuel. Typically, FBOs service general aviation aircraft. Many pilots rely on AirNav to locate fuel availability and price along with other important information about operations, communication, and runways. For example, in New Smyrna Beach (KEVB), pilots can see there is both Jet A fuel and 100LL avgas available on site.

Epic’s training aircraft run on 100LL because they have spark-ignition piston engines. The “100” indicates the octane rating, and “LL” stands for low lead. It is the most common fuel in general aviation. Fun fact: Manufacturers dye this fuel blue so pilots can tell it apart from other aviation fuel.

If you come across green fuel, that is 100/130 avgas. The octane rating is 100 under lean mixture conditions and 130 under rich mixture conditions.

Aviation Fuel Supply Chain

A robust system supports the global aviation fuel supply, including:

Brokers and suppliers manage the market.

Fuel trucks deliver to airports and to aircraft on site.

Fuel pumps, hoses, and tanks maintain safety.

Filter systems prevent fuel contamination.

Fuel cards and tracking sheets record logistics and taxation.

“Misfueling” or “Wrong Fueling” Accidents

When someone puts the wrong fuel into an aircraft, there is a potential for engine failure and crashes. There are too many of these to list, but we do go over this in pilot training and aircraft mechanic training. Some of these incidents include:

2021 – Beechcraft Baron 58: A fueler at the airport did not notice the “avgas only” sticker and fueled with Jet A, resulting in a crash that seriously injured the pilot.

2020 – Aero Commander 500 Shrike: An Alaska forestry plane on its way to fight forest fires crashed into a pond after taking off because the fuel vendor put the wrong fuel in. Passing teenagers who saw the crash rescued the four on board. Although the pilot signed the receipt, he did not notice it showed the wrong fuel.

2019 – Piper Aerostar 602P: A Tampa surgeon’s plane crashed killing him and his flight instructor because a fueler put Jet A In his plane instead of avgas.

This handful of examples is why we train our linemen at Epic along with our pilots and mechanics to be aware of how easily misfueling can occur.

“Our motto is ‘Safety First’ at Epic, and this includes how we operate on the ramp as well as in the classrooms and cockpits. We train our line crew members in safety procedures regarding aircraft fuel, and both pilots and aircraft mechanics receive training in fuel safety procedures.” –Josh Rawlins, Chief Operating Officer and Aircraft Mechanic Program Director

The 10 Most Common Reasons for Misfueling

Using the wrong fuel can cause serious engine damage or failure. That’s why FAA regulations, pre-flight inspections, and quality control procedures all emphasize fuel type verification. Sadly, investigators have traced many accidents and near-misses back to this simple but critical step.

These are the most common reasons someone might put the wrong fuel into an aircraft:

1. Miscommunication Between Pilot and Fueler

Verbal instructions may be unclear or misunderstood. Incorrect assumptions may be made without verifying fuel type.

2. Similar Appearance of Aircraft

Fuelers may assume a plane uses a certain type of fuel based on appearance (e.g., assuming all small planes use avgas), especially if aircraft models look alike.

3. Inadequate Labeling

Mistakes are more likely if the fuel caps or tanks aren’t clearly labeled with the required fuel type. If a label is worn or faded, replace it.

4. Use of Similar Fuel Nozzles

Jet fuel and avgas nozzles are sometimes not properly differentiated (though Jet A nozzles are wider by standard). If adapters are used, they can bypass this safeguard.

5. Fuel Truck Error

The wrong truck may pull up to the aircraft, especially at busy FBOs or during shift changes without proper documentation checks.

6. Human Error or Fatigue

Fatigue, distraction, or complacency by ramp personnel can lead to skipped verification steps. Focus for safety!

7. Unfamiliar Aircraft or Procedures

Pilots or ground crew may be unfamiliar with a specific aircraft’s fuel requirements (e.g., rental planes or chartered aircraft), increasing the risk of error.

8. Language Barriers or International Procedures

Although English is the universal language for pilots, that is not the case for ground crews. In non-English-speaking regions or international operations, differences in terminology or labeling can cause confusion.

9. Incorrect Assumptions by New Staff

New fuelers may incorrectly generalize (e.g., assuming all turbine engines use Jet A without checking specifics).

10. Poor Recordkeeping or Lack of SOPs

When pilots or others fail to follow or document proper checklists or refueling protocols, the chance of error increases.

Aviation Fuel Safety and Performance

Aviation fuel must withstand extreme temperature ranges and pressures. The autoignition temperature and flash point are crucial for safety. Jet fuel, for example, burns at very high temperatures, which supports high-speed, high-altitude airplane operations.

Refining processes remove impurities and create consistent grades. Each grade has a unique performance profile, which affects how an aircraft is fueled and serviced.

Cost and Fuel Efficiency

Aviation fuel is expensive due to refining, global demand, and taxation. Price may be listed per gallon, litre, pound, or unit of energy density. You can use an online fuel calculator to estimate consumption, rate, and carbon emissions.

Fuel additives improve burn efficiency and engine performance. Advanced engines also focus on maximizing fuel efficiency to reduce operating costs.

Comparing Aviation Fuel to Gasoline

Is aviation fuel the same as gasoline? Not quite. While avgas shares similarities with automotive fuel, it’s more refined and contains additives to support high-altitude performance. Jet fuels, based on kerosine, are entirely different, optimized for turbine engines.

Avgas 82UL is an unleaded aviation fuel with an octane rating of 82. It’s made for aircraft that can run on lower-octane fuel and is similar to car gasoline. Such aircraft are either approved by the manufacturer to use it or have a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) that allows the use of automotive gasoline (mogas) with a specific octane rating.

Aviation Fuel Jobs and Opportunities

The aviation fuel industry supports thousands of jobs in refining, service, supply, and analysis. As emerging technologies take hold, new roles in alternative fuels and SAF development are expanding. Here at Epic, our line crew takes care of refueling aircraft among many related tasks.

The Future of Aviation Fuel

Most of us in aviation agree that the future of aviation fuel lies in cleaner, more sustainable sources. With new technologies, increased awareness of carbon emissions, and investments in SAF, the aviation industry is shifting toward a more environmentally responsible model.

Understanding aviation fuel, its types, cost, and use, is key for everyone from pilots and mechanics to passengers concerned about carbon offsetting. As we explore alternative fuels and cutting-edge systems, the evolution of aviation fuel will remain central to the airplane industry’s innovation. As new products emerge, I will circle back and update this article.

Hi there. I have questions regarding flight training. For a beginner, what would the process be? Is 23 too old to start this type of trade school? You don't need any prior training or college, correct? Could you please email me and let me know the answers to my questions. The length of time it would take to complete courses to fly for airlines or something like that in the future? What kind of planes do you have ? How long does it take and what are all the fees? Do you guys have scholarships or financing options? How does that work? Is there like a tuition form you could send me as well with the break down? Is it all included or are there additional fees for gas and the instructors - what is the estimate for those fees ? I couldn't see it on your website. I am just trying to gather information for the best option for us. We have help just need to supply options to decide. I'll be in contact after we narrow our best options. Thank you for your time.

Specifically, the SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

In the global movement toward decarbonisation, few sectors face as formidable a challenge as aviation. High energy density requirements and global mobility needs have made it difficult to reduce emissions without compromising operational efficiency. Yet, an emerging solution is offering a credible path forward: Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF.

Unlike conventional jet fuels, SAF is derived from renewable sources—such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and non-food biomass. What makes SAF particularly transformative is its compatibility with existing aircraft and fuelling infrastructure. This allows it to be adopted without significant operational disruption, which is a critical advantage in a sector where safety and consistency are non-negotiable.

Why SAF Matters: More Than Just a Drop-In Fuel

The benefits of SAF extend far beyond its green credentials. SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent when compared to traditional jet fuel. This makes it one of the most effective tools available for helping aviation reach its net-zero target by 2050.

Because SAF blends can be used in today’s aircraft without any modifications, they offer a practical and scalable way to decarbonise flights in the short- to medium-term. More importantly, SAF enables airlines to maintain their connectivity and economic contributions while progressing toward environmental benchmarks.

An Australian Milestone: SAF Takes Off from Proserpine

A noteworthy example of SAF in action comes from Queensland. In a landmark move, Viva Energy has partnered with Virgin Australia to supply SAF for a series of flights departing from Proserpine Airport between March and July 2025.

This partnership signifies more than just a supply contract. It is an operational demonstration of how SAF can be embedded into routine flight schedules. The blend used in these flights includes 30 to 40 percent synthetic fuel derived from waste and residue feedstocks, ensuring that environmental benefits are realised without compromising performance or safety.

The Economics of Scale: Affordability Through Collaboration

One of the primary challenges in SAF adoption has been cost. As a newer fuel type with limited production infrastructure, SAF is currently more expensive than conventional jet fuel. This is where collaborations like the one between Viva Energy and Virgin Australia become pivotal.

By piloting SAF in commercial settings, these stakeholders are gathering crucial data and laying the groundwork for economies of scale. Greater uptake and diversified production pathways could drive down costs over time, making SAF not only a sustainable choice but also a competitive one.

Infrastructure Investment: Preparing for Tomorrow’s Demand

Realising the full potential of SAF requires more than feedstock and intent—it demands infrastructure. To this end, Viva Energy has secured 2.39 million Australian dollars in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. This funding will be used to refurbish an existing fuel tank at the Pinkenba Terminal, converting it into dedicated SAF storage for Brisbane Airport.

This is a significant move. It signals the shift from pilot projects to scalable supply chains. By integrating SAF into existing pipeline distribution systems, stakeholders are future-proofing aviation fuel logistics and enabling greater accessibility across the network.

Innovation in Tracking: The Book-and-Claim System

Adopting SAF at scale also requires transparent accounting. To address this, Viva Energy is introducing a book-and-claim system. This mechanism allows sustainability certificates to be traded independently of physical SAF deliveries, enabling companies to claim environmental benefits even when direct SAF usage is not feasible.

The approach is especially useful for international carriers and corporations looking to support decarbonisation without logistical constraints. In effect, it makes the sustainability impact of SAF more universally accessible.

The Strategic Outlook: Why This Matters for the Industry

The partnership between Viva Energy and Virgin Australia—and the associated infrastructure and certification mechanisms—demonstrate a comprehensive vision for SAF adoption. It is not just about fuel. It is about building a commercially viable, environmentally aligned aviation system that can scale.

As Nick Adams, General Manager for Aviation at Viva Energy, aptly points out, SAF will play an increasingly important role for commercial airlines aiming to meet both regulatory expectations and growing consumer demand for responsible travel.

Conclusion: A Collective Ascent Towards Sustainable Flight

The trajectory of SAF is not merely a technical evolution—it is a systems-level transformation. From feedstock to fuel tank, from airport to airspace, the integration of SAF is a testament to what is possible when industry, innovation, and policy align.

These developments are not isolated. They are signposts in a larger journey toward sustainable air travel. As more airports, fuel suppliers, and airlines align on this front, the feasibility of net-zero aviation becomes less a vision and more a grounded strategy.

The road ahead will require continued investment, cross-sector collaboration, and transparent governance. But the groundwork is being laid, flight by flight, litre by litre.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-55.svg,N,,2025-06-27 03:59:23.492718

The total emissions for aviation in 2024 were 38.4 MtCO2e, marking a return to pre-pandemic levels.
This increased in 2024, and as a proportion of all jet fuel used in UK aviation rose substantially, from 0.7% in 2023 to 2.1% in 2024.
The UK has a mandate to achieve 10% by 2030, however, and so the CCC said that the overall rise in aviation emissions are “posing a risk to the UK’s emissions targets”.
The evidence was presented to the UK Government’s Environmental Audit Committee earlier this month.","Aviation emissions are continuing to rise, the Government’s independent advisors have warned.

In its assessment of the Government’s progress on reducing emissions, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) found that while overall emissions fell 2.5% in 2024, the tenth consecutive year of sustained reduction in emissions, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic years 2020 and 2021, emissions in the aviation sector increased by nine percent in 2024.

The total emissions for aviation in 2024 were 38.4 MtCO2e, marking a return to pre-pandemic levels. The Government’s 2022 Jet Zero Strategy (JZS) and CBDP, and the Seventh Carbon Budget Balanced Pathway all require emissions to stay flat and start decreasing slowly over the rest of the decade.

The CCC says “Limiting emissions in this way will be difficult if passenger numbers increase without sufficient counterbalancing uptake of low-carbon solutions.”

One of these is the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This increased in 2024, and as a proportion of all jet fuel used in UK aviation rose substantially, from 0.7% in 2023 to 2.1% in 2024.

The UK has a mandate to achieve 10% by 2030, however, and so the CCC said that the overall rise in aviation emissions are “posing a risk to the UK’s emissions targets”.

Although business travel has continued its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the CCC said that the “most significant driver of aviation emissions since 1990 has been rising demand for international flights, particularly leisure.”

The increase in demand for leisure flights has also been powered by a rise in demand for ‘medium haul’ destinations from the UK.

The New Economics Foundation has identified that as a result of carbon taxes on intra-European flight (through the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), there has been a significant increase in leisure flights to ‘medium-haul’ leisure destinations such as Turkey, Greece, the Canary Islands, Morocco, Egypt, Albania, and Saudi Arabia.

The Foundation predicts this trend will increase as the ETS rates increase next year, pushing up prices on short haul flights within Europe and so, ironically, increasing emissions from leisure flights as these increase in duration.

The evidence was presented to the UK Government’s Environmental Audit Committee earlier this month.

GSNR is a nonprofit public benefit corporation established by rural counties to address the urgent issue of catastrophic fires from overgrown and under-managed forests. The group’s initial plans focused on the conversion of woody biomass gathered as part of forest treatment and restoration activities into wood pellets that would be exported for use in large-scale power production and similar applications. The plans included the development of a 700,000-metric-ton-per-year pellet plant in Lassen County and a 300,000-metric-ton-per-year facility in Tuolumne County, along with storage infrastructure at the Port of Stockton.

GSNR in early 2024 signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Drax US BECCS Development LLC “for the joint exploration of sustainable biomass opportunities with a focus on advancing forest resilience and promoting green energy initiatives worldwide.”

In October 2024, GSNR announced the release of a draft environmental impact report (DEIR), as required by the California Environmental Quality Act, for the proposed wood pellet project. The DEIR specified that the MOU with Drax was explicitly non-binding and did not commit Drax to purchase or use any quantity of wood pellets or otherwise become involved in GSNR’s project.

Documents published ahead of GSNR’s June 25 board of directors meeting indicates that the organization received more than 5,500 public comments in response to the DEIR and had identified three viable paths forward for the project.

Under one option, GSNR would have continued with the development of the two proposed full-scale wood pellet plants, updating the project based on the findings of CEQA analysis and comments received. Under another option, GSNR would paused further development at both proposed project sites.

The board, however, voted to move forward with a plan revise the scope of the project, which could include reducing the size and throughput of both facilities while transitioning from producing wood pellets for export to the production of wood chips for domestic use. GSNR noted wood chips could have applications in domestic alternative energy production, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marine biofuels, or in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) applications. Alternatively, wood chips can be used to produce wood products, such as oriented strand board.

According to information published by GSNR, the pivot to wood chip production would significantly lower the project’s capital costs and environmental footprint. The reduced scale of the wood chip project configuration may also facilitate CEQA review and permitting, and expedite site development timelines, improving the feasibility of near-term deployment, the group explained.

Right now, a litre of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per litre in the UK – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97.
They saw themselves as a crucial part of the sustainable aviation fuel puzzle, but were concerned about investing in logistics and infrastructure without guaranteed demand.
Their thinking is dominated by environmental strategy and sustainable aviation fuel regulation.
By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero.","As you wait in the departure lounge for your flight this summer, you may notice your aeroplane being pumped full of fuel ahead of takeoff. And then you may start to wonder why flying is still so dependent on fossil fuels , and whether you should have booked a holiday destination that’s accessible by a more environmentally friendly form of transport.

So what happened to plans for so-called sustainable aviation fuel? Wasn’t it supposed to be the “game changer” that would make flying a much greener travel option than it used to be?

Clearly, the move to adopt the technology is facing difficulties. One problem seems to be that there simply isn’t enough sustainable fuel to go around.

But the business side of the process is also holding back sustainable fuel uptake.

Research my colleagues and I conducted in 2021 revealed a deeply fragmented landscape at pretty much every step of sustainable fuel development. There are obstacles everywhere, blocking the paths of the producers developing these fuels, the airlines who might use them and the governmental and campaign groups pushing for change.

Everyone seems to agree that sustainable fuel matters. They just don’t all agree about how to really get it off the ground.

Our findings demonstrate that producers, for instance, were understandably focused on more research and development to improve efficient production. They were also worried that scaling up facilities could disrupt production that is already in place.

Airlines meanwhile, are grappling with the economics of moving to sustainable fuel, which is around three to ten times more expensive than conventional fuel. Right now, a litre of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per litre in the UK – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97. (Depending on the length of the journey and the size of the engine, a plane could need around 13,000 litres per hour of flying.)

They spoke about inconsistent supply (especially at major airports), and the need for clearer regulations and incentives across the industry.

“Cost is clearly the most important driver,” one airline executive told us, explaining that dealing with those costs would ultimately depend on passenger demand for greener travel – and how willing those passengers are to pay a premium for sustainable fuel.

Distribution companies that take the sustainable fuel where it needs to go, have found themselves struggling to navigate the complexities of an emerging supply chain. They spoke of the logistical challenges of transporting and storing sustainable fuel, and a lack of clear communication between producers and airlines.

They saw themselves as a crucial part of the sustainable aviation fuel puzzle, but were concerned about investing in logistics and infrastructure without guaranteed demand.

Elsewhere, politicians and climate campaigners tend to view the adoption of sustainable fuel from a broader perspective, stressing the urgency of action on climate change. Their thinking is dominated by environmental strategy and sustainable aviation fuel regulation.

But here, trust becomes an issue. Some of those involved with sustainable fuel development said they doubted government promises to support the sector over the long term. Others are cynical about whether airlines will really prioritise climate action over their very tight profit margins .

So sustainable fuel inspires plenty of different viewpoints and concerns. But one common thread was an overwhelming concern about cost and scale of production.

Aside from being far more expensive than fossil-based jet fuel, building enough production facilities to make more will require billions of pounds of investment.

The big question is who will foot the bill.

Some of this will need to be tax funded. For if the UK wants to become a leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel, as the government says it does, it needs more than ambitious targets. It needs to start making things happen.

And our research suggests that the industry as a whole would benefit from some certainty to encourage investment right across the supply chain. Without a clear and stable regulatory framework, everyone will remain hesitant about committing significant resources to sustainable fuel.

Collaboration between the key players could also be improved, with a better dialogue between those in the industry and regulators, potentially leading to a shared vision for the future of sustainable aviation fuel.

That future is by no means doomed. Major commercial airlines like Air France-KLM, IAG (British Airways) and United Airlines in the US are working with sustainable fuel producers around the world.

But while the desire to decarbonise aviation seems clear, the path forward is not straightforward. It is a complex picture of politics, economics, trust and differing priorities.

By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero. But if managed poorly, targets to dramatically increase its use will remain elusive.",,N,,2025-06-26 20:03:37.234028

What is SAF and Why Does It Matter?

SAF is a renewable alternative to traditional jet fuel, made from non-petroleum feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural waste, algae, and even captured carbon. When blended with conventional Jet A or Jet A-1 fuel (typically at levels between 10% and 50%, depending on the specific SAF and regulatory approvals), SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, without requiring modifications to current aircraft engines or airport fueling systems. This drop-in compatibility makes SAF a scalable and immediate solution for sustainable air travel.

What are SAF Made Of? The Diverse Feedstock Landscape

While SAF is increasingly being integrated into existing airport fuel supply chains, dedicated “SAF hubs” emerge as strategic locations for production, blending, storage, and distribution. The “sustainable” in SAF refers to the renewable nature of its source materials. SAF can be produced from a wide array of feedstocks through various technological pathways:

Used Cooking Oil and Animal Fats (HEFA Pathway): Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) are currently the most mature and widely used pathway. This involves refining waste oils, greases, and animal fats.

Agricultural and Forestry Residues: Waste products from farming (like crop residues and forestry residues) and forestry operations can be converted into SAF.

Municipal Solid Waste (MSW): Non-recyclable household and commercial waste, including food scraps, yard waste, and packaging materials, can be transformed into jet fuel, diverting waste from landfills.

Algae: Certain types of algae can be cultivated and processed to produce biofuels suitable for aviation.

Purpose-Grown Energy Crops: Non-food crops grown on marginal lands can be used as dedicated feedstocks for SAF.

Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ): This pathway converts alcohols, such as ethanol (derived from corn, sugarcane, or cellulosic biomass) or isobutanol, into jet fuel.

Power-to-Liquid (PtL) or eFuels: A newer and promising technology that involves synthesizing captured carbon dioxide (from industrial sources or direct air capture) with green hydrogen (produced using renewable electricity) to create synthetic liquid hydrocarbons.

The choice of feedstock and production technology significantly influences the overall carbon reduction potential of the SAF.

How Do SAF Hubs Work?

SAF hubs function as nexuses in the SAF supply chain:

Feedstock Sourcing: Hubs are often strategically located near sources of viable feedstock or with good transportation links to receive them.

Production: Dedicated refineries or retrofitted conventional refineries utilize various approved technologies (HEFA, AtJ, PtL, etc.) to convert feedstocks into SAF.

Blending: The neat SAF is then blended with conventional jet fuel to meet current certification standards (e.g., up to a 50% blend).

Storage and Distribution: The blended SAF is stored and then distributed to airports through existing pipelines, tankers, or dedicated fueling infrastructure.

“Book and Claim” Systems: Many regions also utilize “book and claim” systems. This allows an airline or corporation to purchase SAF certificates (SAFc) representing the environmental benefits of a certain volume of SAF, even if the physical fuel is not delivered to their specific location. The actual SAF is used by an aircraft operator at an airport where it is physically available. This system helps aggregate demand, fund SAF production, and allows entities to meet their emission reduction goals regardless of their geographical proximity to SAF supply.

Economic Development Through Clean Aviation

SAF market is projected to exceed $6.9 billion in the U.S. by 2030. With Greater Seattle’s aerospace supply chain, skilled talent, and abundant clean energy, the region is uniquely positioned to capture a significant share of that market. SAF innovation is already spurring job creation, attracting international investment, and strengthening our region’s leadership in next-generation fuels. These efforts support both metro and rural communities, from Moses Lake to Walla Walla to the Puget Sound.

Incentives: Fueling the Growth of SAF

Federal programs such as the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge aim to produce 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2030. Washington’s policy leadership, including state tax incentives up to $2/gallon, complements the national framework, creating fertile ground for SAF innovation and commercialization.

Investment Landscape: Who is Investing in SAF?

Significant investments are flowing into the SAF sector from a diverse range of players:

Airlines: Major carriers such as United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Air France-KLM, British Airways (IAG), Qantas, American Airlines, and Alaska Airlines are making substantial investments in SAF through direct procurement agreements, equity stakes in SAF producers, and partnerships to develop new production facilities.

Energy Companies: Traditional oil and gas giants like Shell, Neste, TotalEnergies, and ExxonMobil are leveraging their refining expertise and infrastructure to become major SAF producers. They are investing in new facilities and retrofitting existing ones.

Specialized Biofuel Companies: Dedicated SAF producers and developers like Gevo, World Energy, Fulcrum BioEnergy, and LanzaTech are attracting significant capital to scale up their innovative production technologies.

Private Equity and Infrastructure Investors: Firms such as Bain Capital (investing in EcoCeres) and Brookfield Asset Management (investing in Infinium) recognize the long-term potential of SAF and are injecting substantial capital into SAF projects and infrastructure.

Aircraft and Engine Manufacturers: Companies like Boeing and Airbus are actively involved in SAF development, testing, and investing in SAF initiatives to ensure compatibility and promote adoption. Honeywell is also a key technology provider and investor.

Governments: Beyond incentives, governments are directly investing in research and development and providing financial backing for pioneering SAF projects.

The World Economic Forum highlights the need for an estimated $19-45 billion in capital expenditure by 2030 to meet SAF production demands.

Switching to lower-carbon fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel for air travel, is one of the strategies included in the Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation's forthcoming emissions reduction plan.

That plan is a requirement of a landmark settlement agreement the state reached with a group of youth plaintiffs last summer who claimed the state hadn't done enough to reduce climate pollution from the transportation sector. HDOT is expected to release a draft of the plan on Friday.

HDOT director Ed Sniffen told lawmakers on Wednesday that transitioning to lower-carbon fuels and electrification across air, marine, and ground travel will have the ""biggest impact"" of all the emissions-reduction strategies that have been evaluated.

Domestic aviation is responsible for about a quarter of the state's total emissions.

The aviation industry has already been working to swap out jet fuel with lower-carbon alternatives, and many airlines that service Hawaiʻi including Hawaiian and Alaska have set their own emissions-reduction goals.

But sustainable aviation fuel is more expensive than conventional fuel and in limited supply, and Sniffen said the state's timeline to achieve net-zero emissions is more aggressive than those set by the airlines.

""It's difficult for industry to swallow. There's going to be additional costs that come to them, additional costs that come to all of us as users,"" Sniffen said.

Sniffen said HDOT has had conversations with stakeholders in the aviation, marine, and ground transportation sectors about the hurdles in the state's transition away from fossil fuels.

""I will say none of the industries are pushing back and saying, 'This is not important.' They're just saying, 'We got to see how we do this so we can afford it,'"" he added.

A clean fuel standard could incentivize the development and use of lower-carbon fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, biodiesel, and even electrification through tax credits.

HDOT says it plans to prepare a legislative package for lawmakers ahead of the 2026 legislative session that could include a clean fuel standard.

""The state needs to take some action, similar to states such as California and Washington, to make these fuels competitive in the market,"" said Nicholas Nishimura, a rising junior at Waipahu High School and a member of HDOT's youth council, which has been working with the department on its greenhouse gas reduction plan.

Nishimura cautioned that the transition away from imported gasoline and jet fuel may raise costs for Hawaiʻi consumers.

With the help of the University of Hawaiʻi, HDOT is currently conducting an analysis of the possible financial impact of a clean fuel standard on Hawaiʻi residents, which will be provided to lawmakers ahead of the next legislative session.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e1b08fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x2948+0+451/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F09%2F03%2F592aecd84218986d4f955187c96d%2Fap100607016266.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 18:08:27.646333

The goal is clear: to simplify, accelerate, and bring transparency to the SAF procurement process in a market that is still developing.

A Solution for Three Key Challenges

SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical needs in the sector:

1. Efficiency in SAF Procurement

The platform centralizes SAF requests and offers, eliminating barriers and additional costs. This significantly reduces the time and complexity airlines face when searching for suppliers, thereby fostering the growth of the voluntary SAF market.

2. Direct Connectivity Between Stakeholders

Producers and suppliers of sustainable fuel can post available or projected volumes, while airlines register their interest in acquiring specific quantities. When a match is made, the parties can take negotiations offline to finalize details such as pricing and payment terms.

3. Market Visibility and Transparency

The system provides detailed information about each available SAF batch: volume, feedstock used, location, production technology, associated emission reductions, and compliance with international regulations such as CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) or the EU Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

→ EASA and IATA Launch Global Plan to Mitigate GNSS Interference Risks

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist, highlighted the strategic impact of this tool: “To achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. SAF Matchmaker demonstrates IATA’s commitment to building a fully operational market that facilitates SAF adoption, reducing costs and barriers for airlines.”

Exclusive Platform, for Now

In its initial phase, SAF Matchmaker will be available exclusively to airlines and SAF suppliers. However, IATA anticipates that other buyers, such as corporations from sectors not directly related to aviation, may join later.

UK in formal talks to avert biofuel plant closure

London, 26 June (Argus) — Associated British Foods (AFB), the multinational food and ingredients group, has said it will shut its 416mn litres/yr Vivergo bioethanol plant near Hull, eastern England, before 13 September unless the UK government agrees to urgent support measures. The company confirmed that ""formal negotiations"" with the government are now under way to find a ""sustainable solution"". But with the outcome uncertain, it has already stopped purchasing wheat feedstocks as of 11 June and begun consultations with staff ""to effect an orderly wind-down"" once existing contractual obligations are met. ABF said the government would need to provide ""both short-term funding of Vivergo's losses and a longer-term solution"" to avoid closure. The future of the plant ""will depend on whether the negotiations deliver a credible route forwards"", it said. The closure threat follows a UK-US trade agreement that removes import tariffs on up to 1.4bn l/yr of US ethanol — roughly equal to total UK demand. Domestic producers say the deal has made the UK market unviable by allowing cheaper US imports to undercut local output. Paul Kenward — chief executive of ABF Sugar, the division of ABF that includes Vivergo Fuels — told MPs earlier this month that the trade deal effectively hands the UK market to US exporters. He proposed raising the UK's ethanol blending mandate from E10 to E15, saying this would give the industry ""room to breathe"", and also suggested a support package worth £75mn/yr ($100mn) for up to two years to help the sector adjust. Vivergo previously told Argus that an E15 mandate could boost demand by 660mn l/yr and highlighted the potential for increased bioethanol use in marine and aviation sectors. German-owned Ensus, which operates the UK's only other bioethanol plant at Wilton on Teesside, has also warned of potential closure. The firm told Argus that it received a letter from the government's minister for business and trade acknowledging the economic challenges it faces as a direct result of the US trade deal. Ensus said it welcomed the government's recognition of its request for regulatory changes that could help the UK industry remain viable, along with the need for interim financial support.

Brazil looks to Cop 30 as progress slow at Bonn

Bonn, 26 June (Argus) — Technical climate talks at Bonn, to prepare for political negotiations at the UN Cop 30 summit in Belem, Brazil in November, look set to end with little progress on mitigation — actions to cut greenhouse gas emissions. As negotiations continue, the incoming Brazilian presidency has signalled it is seeking new avenues as formal processes have become bogged down. New nationally determined contributions (NDCs), countries' climate plans to 2035, due this year, were not formally discussed in Bonn. Few nations have submitted them, so far, and commitments will once again likely be insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5°C. The Paris agreement seeks to curb the temperature rise to ""well below"" 2°C, and to pursue a 1.5°C limit. Brazil on Wednesday called the NDCs a ""portrait"" of where states see themselves in 2035, saying that if it does not look good ""we will need to work together to improve it."" Brazil and the EU may be pinning hopes on the leaders' summit at Cop 30 to cut through the logjam. The EU ""sees value in having a political space for high-level discussions"" in response to the NDC synthesis report, it said. This report — due to be released on 24 October — will sum up countries' NDCs as long as they are submitted by September. This could provide a focal point for action ahead of the conference. Another avenue to find progress which Brazil has pushed is the ""action agenda"", a programme of voluntary initiatives by national and sub-national governments as well as civil society and private businesses, which runs alongside the formal negotiations between states. There are hopes that the states seeking to push mitigation the most could create a ""coalition of the willing,"" according to Andreas Sieber of environmental non-governmental organization (NGO) 350.org. This would generate momentum for initiatives which then make the leap to the negotiated process. This was the case for the pledge to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030, which originated in the action agenda at Cop 28 in Dubai in 2023 but then made it into the formal outcomes of the summit. By engaging first with willing states, Brazil avoids obstructions, typically from large oil exporters. Baku 2.0 But so far in Bonn, progress on a key element for mitigation — a programme to discuss the meaning of the global stocktake (GST) — has bogged down. The GST, conducted in Dubai in 2023, was a review of the progress on reaching the goals of the Paris accord. It expressed the need to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems. But talks on the GST have stalled since, and one delegate expressed a fear that the talks could be entering the same realm as the mitigation work programme (MWP), another workstream which has delivered little progress. Ensuring that discussion of options continues between Bonn and Belem will be key to lay the ground for solid outcomes once decision-makers are in the room, with some sensing a shift to more positive engagement. But frustrations over a new $300bn/yr climate finance target for developing nations could resurface in Brazil. Developing and developed countries were at loggerheads on climate finance and mitigation into the last minutes of the Baku summit. Brazilian climate agency Observatorio do Clima said the focus on finance at Bonn was much more prominent than the incoming Cop presidency expected, with Cop 30 risking ""becoming a Baku 2.0"". Meeting the priorities of many developing countries — more, better and accessible finance — may prove difficult. The Brazilian presidency said today that the Baku to Belem roadmap — a workstream decided on last year to work out ways to increase finance on to $1.3tn/yr — was supported by developing countries. But their priorities differ from those of G20 countries, the Brazil presidency said, implying that agreement may be hard to find. In the absence of the US, which did not send a delegation to Bonn, Brussels and Berlin have emerged as new blockers to talking about increasing finance, according to Victor Menotti of NGO Demand climate justice.

Australian gas firm sued over ‘greenwashing’ claim

Adelaide, 26 June (Argus) — Australia's competition regulator is suing gas distributor Australian Gas Networks (AGN) in the federal court, alleging ""greenwashing"" occurred in an advertising campaign in 2022 and 2023. AGN misled customers when it ran ""Love Gas"" TV and digital advertisements claiming that gas in its network would be renewable within a generation without holding reasonable grounds that would be the case, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said. ""It is not currently possible to distribute renewable gas at scale and at an economically viable price,"" ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said on 26 June. ""We allege even though AGN knew the future of renewable gas was uncertain, it made an unqualified representation to consumers that it would distribute renewable gas to households within a generation."" AGN, a major gas distribution firm owned by Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK, forms part of the firm's Australian Gas Infrastructure (AGIG) business. The distributor services more than 1.3mn customers via about 27,000km of distribution networks and 1,300km of gas pipelines. The firm strives to provide clear and accurate communications about the role and benefits of natural gas today and renewable gas into the future and that the company will defend the claims in court, a spokesman for AGIG said. AGIG, an early developer of small-scale green hydrogen blending in gas networks, plans to start operations of its 10MW Hydrogen Park Murray Valley project in late 2025. A 1.25MW project in South Australia's state capital Adelaide began operations in 2021 . Canberra promised to police claims about emissions more strictly, pledging millions of dollars in 2023 to fund regulatory oversight of fossil fuel producers and distributors . The Australian Securities and Investments Commission's first court action for alleged greenwashing was against Mercer Superannuation and concluded in August 2024. The federal court fined the pension fund A$11.3mn ($7.4mn) for misleading statements about seven ""Sustainable Plus"" investment options. The court found that the options included investments in 15 companies involved in fossil fuel sales, such as BHP, Glencore and Whitehaven Coal.

Brazil's E30, B15 blends to start 1 Aug: Update

Adds statement from National oil and gas institute IBP. Sao Paulo, 25 June (Argus) — Brazilian regulators have approved an increase in ethanol and biodiesel blending into fossil fuels effective 1 August. In a meeting of the mines and energy ministry and national energy policy council CNPE today, the government decided to move forward with an increase in ethanol blending rates into gasoline to 30pc to make E30, and to blend 15pc biodiesel into diesel to create B15. CNPE is evaluating the feasibility of raising ethanol blends to a 22-35pc range and biodiesel blends to a 13-25pc range, mines and energy ministry's biofuels department director Marlon Arraes said during Argus ' Biofuels & Feedstocks Latin America Conference, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. National oil and gas institute IBP declared its support for the ethanol and biodiesel blend increases, while asking for more autonomy for hydrocarbons regulator ANP to improve quality monitoring and ensure safety to final consumers. The fuel of the future program, introduced to the Congress on September 2023, spurred more than R53bn ($9.6bn) of investments in biodiesel to achieve a 25pc mix by 2026, as well as R24bn invested in ethanol to reach a 35pc blend that same year, Arraes said. Investments in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) through advanced geological techniques reached R140bn, while investments in biomethane and products such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green diesel reached bring that total up to R260bn. Cost competitiveness, feedstock supply risks and regulatory instability remain hurdles to a wider biofuel framework in Brazil, he said. The fuel of the future program avoided 705mn metric tonnes (t) of CO2 equivalent, Arraes said, mostly from CCUS and biodiesel investments. ""We need to engage in our way to produce biofuels and sustainable energy to deliver to society the cheapest decarbonization that we can"", he added.

Initiated by the Chinese General Consulate in Frankfurt and co-organized by Xinhuanet and other Chinese and German organizations, the second Sino-European Corporate ESG Best Practices Conference is held here with aim to pay tribute to the companies that have fared well in putting the ESG concept into practice and promote further cooperation between Chinese and European companies in this regard.

ESG is no longer an add-on, but a strategic element of modern corporate management. It helps identify risks early, set standards, and build long-term, stable partnerships, said Thorsten Giehler, head of Economy, Employment, Social Development of Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, a service provider for international cooperation for sustainable development and international educational work.

Giehler called on stakeholders to work on clear, practical rules which can provide guidance and planning security to facilitate the application of ESG.

Huang Yiyang, Chinese Consul General in Frankfurt, believed that the function of ESG should go well beyond a technical jargon and be considered as a solution for the future.

As staunch defenders of the ideas of multilateralism, open cooperation and green transformation, China and Europe should stand out and join hands to provide leadership and confidence for the global cause of ESG at a time of rising uncertainties, Huang stressed in a speech made on Wednesday night.

As a co-organizer of the conference, Xinhuanet intends to boost the dissemination and applications of the ESG concept among Chinese and European companies, Chu Xuejun, chairman of the board of Xinhuanet Co., Ltd. told Xinhua. It will not only be beneficial for China and Europe to achieve a win-win result in green transformation, but also set a solid stage for further and deeper economic and trade cooperation between the two sides, Chu added.

With a case detailing the joint initiative with Air China, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Technical Pathway Challenge for Chinese Universities, Airbus Germany turned out to be one of the winners at the conference.

""This recognition highlights both the project's impact and the strong partnership between China and the EU,"" said Anna Lisa Junge on behalf of Airbus Germany.

""Today's recognition inspires us to go further. We look forward to deepening our cooperation with Air China and other partners, advancing SAF and broader ESG practices -- in China, and for the globe.""

ESG application cases in areas including environment protection, social responsibility, corporate management, scientific and technological innovation, education and training, and other ESG-related innovative practices, have been submitted to the conference for review by a committee consisting of Chinese and European experts.

The two-day event also featured CEO dialogues, application case study, discussions and roadshows, with leading Chinese and European companies looking to explore the possibility of putting the ESG concept into better mass practices. ■",,N,,2025-06-26 17:07:26.809618

By providing a $1.50-per-gallon tax credit for those who purchase, produce or blend sustainable aviation fuel, this legislation would directly support farmers and the businesses that develop and supply cleaner-burning SAF.
“Access to sustainable, reliable and affordable energy products is critical to long-term economic growth,” Bellino said.
“I am proud to be part of a commonsense, bipartisan approach to enlisting Michigan farmers in the effort to provide cleaner aviation fuel in our state.
It is a proactive solution that supports our local farmers, boosts our agriculture industry and better ensures stable fuel costs—all while also helping cut harmful emissions.”","The Michigan Senate passed bipartisan legislation June 25 to help launch the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Michigan.

Sponsored by Senate Majority Floor Leader Sam Singh, D-East Lansing, and Sen. Joseph Bellino, R-Monroe, Senate Bills 235–36 would establish an income tax credit for the producers and blenders of SAF—a move that would support Michigan’s farmers and economy while reducing the state’s carbon footprint.

“It has been an exciting process to partner with my colleagues across the aisle and across the chamber on this legislation, which not only aims to support Michigan farmers but—in continuing what was outlined in the Clean Energy Future plan—would reduce our reliance on fossil fuels,” Singh said. “This legislation will open new markets for farmers, helping revitalize rural economies and reinforcing the connection between our agricultural sector and the state’s energy goals.”

SAF is an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel, produced using biobased renewable products manufactured from crops like soybeans or corn.

By providing a $1.50-per-gallon tax credit for those who purchase, produce or blend sustainable aviation fuel, this legislation would directly support farmers and the businesses that develop and supply cleaner-burning SAF.

Additional incentives are available if greater emissions reductions are reached.

There is a maximum incentive cap of $4.5 million annually in the first year, and $9 million each year after.

“Access to sustainable, reliable and affordable energy products is critical to long-term economic growth,” Bellino said. “I am proud to be part of a commonsense, bipartisan approach to enlisting Michigan farmers in the effort to provide cleaner aviation fuel in our state. It is a proactive solution that supports our local farmers, boosts our agriculture industry and better ensures stable fuel costs—all while also helping cut harmful emissions.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_21fcc3636f584612a4ad49980d01f4db~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_787,h_524,al_c,lg_1,q_85/80995f_21fcc3636f584612a4ad49980d01f4db~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-06-26 19:05:05.134826

With environmental concerns rising and governments pushing for cleaner, greener alternatives, sustainability is now a central focus for aviation companies, professionals, and stakeholders alike. It is no longer a niche area of expertise, but a foundational aspect that every aviation professional must understand and act upon.

According to Marie Owens, Senior Vice President of Sustainability & Chief Economist at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), sustainability is “a very existential issue for our industry and for the world in its approach to our industry.” This statement underscores the importance of sustainability in aviation and highlights the urgency of action as the industry grapples with rising environmental pressures.

The Need for a Collective Approach

The aviation sector has long been aware of its environmental impact, but the scale of that impact—and the responsibility to address it—has grown significantly in recent years. Governments worldwide have set ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the aviation sector is no exception. The European Union’s aviation emissions trading system (EU ETS), the United States’ climate commitments, and similar initiatives from other nations highlight the growing regulatory pressure on the industry to reduce carbon footprints.

Governments have also taken steps to encourage greener practices by providing funding and support for research into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), electric aircraft technologies, and more efficient air traffic management systems. The UK, for instance, recently launched its Green Aviation Strategy, which includes a roadmap for net-zero emissions by 2050. These actions reflect an undeniable truth: sustainability is not optional but essential to the future of aviation.

In this context, the role of aviation professionals is more critical than ever. Professionals across all levels of the industry—from engineers and pilots to policymakers and sustainability officers—must work collectively to advance the sector’s sustainability agenda.

Training: A Vital Step Toward Sustainability Expertise

As sustainability becomes increasingly central to the aviation industry, governments and aviation organizations are emphasizing the need for specialized training to equip professionals with the skills necessary for this transformation. The IATA recognizes that moving toward sustainability requires not only investment in technologies and infrastructure but also in people. Professionals with expertise in sustainable practices are in high demand.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, has long advocated for environmental responsibility within aviation. In 2019, ICAO established the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which is a global market-based measure aimed at helping the sector offset its emissions. This initiative further underscores the growing need for professionals who are well-versed in sustainability principles, carbon offset programs, and green aviation technologies.

Training programs and courses designed to promote sustainability awareness and expertise are essential to help professionals keep pace with the evolving needs of the industry. Whether it’s understanding how to integrate sustainable aviation fuel into flight operations or navigating the regulatory landscape of carbon emissions trading, training will be crucial for professionals who want to remain competitive in the workforce.

Three Key Steps to Enhance Your Sustainability Skills

As aviation faces growing demands to meet sustainability goals, professionals must adopt a proactive approach to ensure their skills align with industry needs. Below, we outline three key steps that aviation professionals can take to build a sustainable skill set and stay competitive in this rapidly evolving field.

1. Stay Informed About Global Regulations and Policies

Government policies and international agreements play a key role in shaping the aviation industry’s path toward sustainability. Professionals must stay up-to-date with regulatory developments, such as the EU’s Green Deal, ICAO’s CORSIA, and any region-specific initiatives. Understanding how these policies impact the aviation sector—and your specific role—will allow you to make informed decisions and ensure compliance.

Governments are also focusing on providing incentives and grants to support the transition to sustainable aviation. Familiarizing yourself with such programs can open doors to funding and innovation within your organization.

2. Invest in Specialized Training and Certification

Many governments and international organizations, including the IATA and ICAO, offer specialized training programs aimed at fostering sustainability expertise in aviation professionals. These courses can cover topics ranging from carbon emissions management to the implementation of sustainable aviation technologies.

Certifications such as the IATA Environmental Management for Aviation (EMA) and ICAO’s environmental courses can add significant value to your resume, proving your commitment to sustainability and boosting your career prospects. By enhancing your qualifications, you not only increase your value as a professional but also contribute to advancing the industry as a whole.

3. Foster Collaboration and Innovation

Sustainability in aviation requires the collective efforts of all stakeholders. Governments, airlines, manufacturers, regulators, and academics must work together to achieve the sector’s environmental goals. As an aviation professional, you can contribute by actively engaging with sustainability initiatives and collaborating with others in the field.

Look for opportunities to partner with organizations focused on sustainability or join forums and working groups that drive innovation in green aviation. By sharing knowledge and ideas, you will contribute to the collective effort to build a more sustainable aviation future.

Conclusion

Sustainability in aviation is no longer a choice but a necessity. With the environmental impacts of the aviation industry being scrutinized more than ever, governments and organizations worldwide are pushing for greener practices, and professionals must keep pace with these developments. By focusing on continuous training, staying informed about global policies, and actively fostering collaboration, aviation professionals can help build a sustainable future for the industry. As we celebrate World Environment Day, let’s reflect on the collective responsibility we share in ensuring that aviation continues to take flight toward a greener, more sustainable tomorrow.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sustainable-aviation-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 19:05:08.532118

S Africa's Natref refinery set for July-Oct work

London, 26 June (Argus) — South Africa's 107,000 b/d Natref refinery in Sasolburg will undergo a partial maintenance shutdown from July to October affecting several of its units. The turnaround is understood from South African market sources to affect units producing gasoline, middle distillates and heavy end products, including bitumen. The refinery's bitumen customers received communication on 24 June from UK-based Prax Group, Natref's minority shareholder with a 36.4pc stake, saying the refinery will undergo maintenance work from 14 July to 8 October. An official at Sasol, which holds a 63.3pc controlling stake in Natref, said today it could not comment on the refinery's maintenance plans, while Prax officials have so far been unavailable for comment. The refinery's bitumen customers were informed in April that it would cease bitumen production in September, with final stocks of the product to be sold out a month later. The move will be one of the results of a major upgrade programme at the refinery that will enable it to run on light sweet crudes and comply with the country's Clean Fuels 2 regulations that come into force on 1 July 2027. Bitumen market participants said they have been informed that Sasol will maintain normal bitumen production and supply during the upcoming turnaround, while Prax will have no availability of the product. Bitumen production and truck loadings only resumed in early June , following an unexpected outage in mid-May caused by steam supply issues.

Brazil looks to Cop 30 as progress slow at Bonn

Bonn, 26 June (Argus) — Technical climate talks at Bonn, to prepare for political negotiations at the UN Cop 30 summit in Belem, Brazil in November, look set to end with little progress on mitigation — actions to cut greenhouse gas emissions. As negotiations continue, the incoming Brazilian presidency has signalled it is seeking new avenues as formal processes have become bogged down. New nationally determined contributions (NDCs), countries' climate plans to 2035, due this year, were not formally discussed in Bonn. Few nations have submitted them, so far, and commitments will once again likely be insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5°C. The Paris agreement seeks to curb the temperature rise to ""well below"" 2°C, and to pursue a 1.5°C limit. Brazil on Wednesday called the NDCs a ""portrait"" of where states see themselves in 2035, saying that if it does not look good ""we will need to work together to improve it."" Brazil and the EU may be pinning hopes on the leaders' summit at Cop 30 to cut through the logjam. The EU ""sees value in having a political space for high-level discussions"" in response to the NDC synthesis report, it said. This report — due to be released on 24 October — will sum up countries' NDCs as long as they are submitted by September. This could provide a focal point for action ahead of the conference. Another avenue to find progress which Brazil has pushed is the ""action agenda"", a programme of voluntary initiatives by national and sub-national governments as well as civil society and private businesses, which runs alongside the formal negotiations between states. There are hopes that the states seeking to push mitigation the most could create a ""coalition of the willing,"" according to Andreas Sieber of environmental non-governmental organization (NGO) 350.org. This would generate momentum for initiatives which then make the leap to the negotiated process. This was the case for the pledge to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030, which originated in the action agenda at Cop 28 in Dubai in 2023 but then made it into the formal outcomes of the summit. By engaging first with willing states, Brazil avoids obstructions, typically from large oil exporters. Baku 2.0 But so far in Bonn, progress on a key element for mitigation — a programme to discuss the meaning of the global stocktake (GST) — has bogged down. The GST, conducted in Dubai in 2023, was a review of the progress on reaching the goals of the Paris accord. It expressed the need to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems. But talks on the GST have stalled since, and one delegate expressed a fear that the talks could be entering the same realm as the mitigation work programme (MWP), another workstream which has delivered little progress. Ensuring that discussion of options continues between Bonn and Belem will be key to lay the ground for solid outcomes once decision-makers are in the room, with some sensing a shift to more positive engagement. But frustrations over a new $300bn/yr climate finance target for developing nations could resurface in Brazil. Developing and developed countries were at loggerheads on climate finance and mitigation into the last minutes of the Baku summit. Brazilian climate agency Observatorio do Clima said the focus on finance at Bonn was much more prominent than the incoming Cop presidency expected, with Cop 30 risking ""becoming a Baku 2.0"". Meeting the priorities of many developing countries — more, better and accessible finance — may prove difficult. The Brazilian presidency said today that the Baku to Belem roadmap — a workstream decided on last year to work out ways to increase finance on to $1.3tn/yr — was supported by developing countries. But their priorities differ from those of G20 countries, the Brazil presidency said, implying that agreement may be hard to find. In the absence of the US, which did not send a delegation to Bonn, Brussels and Berlin have emerged as new blockers to talking about increasing finance, according to Victor Menotti of NGO Demand climate justice.

Shell moves to quash BP deal talk

London, 26 June (Argus) — Shell today reiterated it is not considering a bid for its UK peer BP, following up its denial on Wednesday, 25 June, and pointed to a London listing rule that imposes restrictions on making an offer. The denials were prompted by a report in the Wall Street Journal that Shell was in early-stage discussions about a possible acquisition of BP. That in turn followed a Bloomberg article in May that said Shell had been evaluating the feasibility of acquiring its rival. Today Shell explicitly pointed to Rule 2.8 of the UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, which imposes restrictions on a party that has said it does not intend to make an offer for a company that is subject to the code. Usually once a party has said it does not intend to bid for a company subject to the code, that party cannot then make a takeover approach for a period of six months. Shell did note, however, that it has the right to set the Rule 2.8 restrictions aside under certain circumstances, such as if a third party announces a firm intention to make an offer for BP. Shell's management team has repeatedly emphasised that the company sees better value in its own shares, which it believes are rated too low by investors. ""Everything we do has to rank against… the shares and the buying back of the shares,"" chief financial officer Sinead Gorman noted on the company's first-quarter earnings call in May.

Australian gas firm sued over ‘greenwashing’ claim

Adelaide, 26 June (Argus) — Australia's competition regulator is suing gas distributor Australian Gas Networks (AGN) in the federal court, alleging ""greenwashing"" occurred in an advertising campaign in 2022 and 2023. AGN misled customers when it ran ""Love Gas"" TV and digital advertisements claiming that gas in its network would be renewable within a generation without holding reasonable grounds that would be the case, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said. ""It is not currently possible to distribute renewable gas at scale and at an economically viable price,"" ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said on 26 June. ""We allege even though AGN knew the future of renewable gas was uncertain, it made an unqualified representation to consumers that it would distribute renewable gas to households within a generation."" AGN, a major gas distribution firm owned by Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK, forms part of the firm's Australian Gas Infrastructure (AGIG) business. The distributor services more than 1.3mn customers via about 27,000km of distribution networks and 1,300km of gas pipelines. The firm strives to provide clear and accurate communications about the role and benefits of natural gas today and renewable gas into the future and that the company will defend the claims in court, a spokesman for AGIG said. AGIG, an early developer of small-scale green hydrogen blending in gas networks, plans to start operations of its 10MW Hydrogen Park Murray Valley project in late 2025. A 1.25MW project in South Australia's state capital Adelaide began operations in 2021 . Canberra promised to police claims about emissions more strictly, pledging millions of dollars in 2023 to fund regulatory oversight of fossil fuel producers and distributors . The Australian Securities and Investments Commission's first court action for alleged greenwashing was against Mercer Superannuation and concluded in August 2024. The federal court fined the pension fund A$11.3mn ($7.4mn) for misleading statements about seven ""Sustainable Plus"" investment options. The court found that the options included investments in 15 companies involved in fossil fuel sales, such as BHP, Glencore and Whitehaven Coal.

But unlike the E.U. which has established a long-term SAF strategy with its mandates under ReFuelEU (requiring 70% of all fuel uplifted at EU airports be SAF by 2050)2, U.S. SAF policy remains in a state of limbo especially as the H.R. 1 bill (President Trump’s “big, beautiful bill”) headed for a Senate vote seeks to hamper the ability of the country’s leading SAF policy - the 45z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit - to truly encourage sustainable SAF production. This paper provides an overview of the technological options available to the U.S. based on its available resources, finding that despite the early success of the HEFA (Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids) pathway, domestic SAF will have to be carried forward by Alcohol-to-Jet, Gasification, and e-SAF pathways. Policy improvements are then recommended to ensure the environmental and economic sustainability of SAF production, in particular for the Alcohol-to-Jet and e-SAF sectors that have a more complex scaling road ahead of them. The objectives of these recommendations include but are not limited to ensuring a thorough LCA understanding of corn ethanol, strengthening the requirements of the Renewable Fuel Standard, and promoting the competitiveness of American electro-fuels. Their ultimate goal, however, is to reach domestic production levels of truly sustainable SAF in line with the targets of the federal government’s Grand SAF Challenge: meeting the projected domestic demand of 35 billion gallons annually by 2050.",Not Available,https://escholarship.org/images/escholarship-facebook2.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 18:13:14.008837

His leadership and scientific acumen have been instrumental in bringing the Concorde back into the skies, underscoring the significance of innovation-driven, sustainable aviation solutions.
Ideally blending its timeless heritage with forward-looking innovation, Concorde will redefine travel worldwide once again and show how sustainability and luxury can coexist and thrive at supersonic speeds.","In what can only be termed a history-making verdict that will give the world’s skies a revolution, iconic supersonic legend Concorde, synonymous with speed and luxury, is set to fly again come 2026. It comes at an opportune moment when it’s marking its record-setting maiden first-ever first flight on its golden 50th-anniversary celebration, marking a grand resurgence for supersonic passenger aircraft.

A Landmark Decision: The “Concorde Bill”

This revival has been made possible by the executive order signed by former U.S. President Donald J. Trump on June 6th, 2025, widely referred to as the “Concorde Bill.” This significant legislation lifts a decades-long ban that had stifled supersonic innovation due to environmental concerns and the disruptive sonic booms created by previous-generation aircraft flying over populated areas. Originally enacted to mitigate noise pollution and environmental impact, the ban effectively halted all progress in supersonic passenger aviation over continental land.

With this landmark regulatory shift, experts predict unprecedented innovation, reigniting global interest and investment in sustainable supersonic technology. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) anticipates significant economic benefits from this resurgence, along with measurable advancements in aerospace engineering and environmental sustainability.

Sustainable Technology: Greener, Quieter, Faster

While the legendary exterior silhouette of Concorde remains unchanged—preserving its status as an icon of aviation elegance—the technology beneath its sleek skin has been entirely transformed. The new-generation Concorde will be approximately 50% lighter than the original model, achieved through the use of advanced composite materials. This significant weight reduction directly translates to superior fuel efficiency and a reduced environmental footprint.

Powered primarily by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the reborn Concorde will deliver an impressive 80% reduction in emissions compared to its predecessor. This dramatic environmental improvement aligns with global aviation goals outlined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which advocates for increased sustainability within the industry.

Additionally, extensive research and design innovations by Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill, a distinguished physicist from Oxford University, have culminated in groundbreaking sonic boom suppression technology. After more than two decades of dedicated research, Churchill secured the world’s first patent for this innovative system in May 2025, perfectly timed to coincide with the Concorde revival. This pioneering technology promises dramatically quieter supersonic flights, enabling the aircraft to fly at speeds surpassing Mach 2 (twice the speed of sound) without disruptive sonic booms at ground level.

Luxury Interiors: Timeless Elegance Meets Japanese Aesthetic

Continuing Concorde’s legacy of luxury travel, the new interiors promise an unparalleled passenger experience. Crafted by internationally renowned architects who specialize in sustainable design, the interior space will embody a refined Japanese aesthetic, balancing simplicity, elegance, and sustainability. Passengers can expect meticulously curated cabins designed with natural, eco-friendly materials, enhancing comfort, serenity, and overall well-being at an altitude of 60,000 feet.

This luxurious yet eco-conscious approach firmly positions Concorde at the forefront of modern aviation, where innovation meets indulgence without compromising environmental integrity.

Digital Innovation: Introducing Concorde Coin (CSSC)

The revival of Concorde extends beyond aviation engineering into the realm of digital innovation. Fly-Concorde Limited, spearheading the development, has introduced Concorde Coin (CSSC)—a blockchain-based stablecoin directly backed by tangible Concorde assets and operational revenues. This innovative digital asset aims to offer passengers and investors an exciting and secure way to engage financially with the iconic Concorde brand.

With increasing global acceptance of blockchain and cryptocurrency as secure investment vehicles, CSSC positions Concorde at the intersection of luxury travel and digital finance, appealing to a new generation of tech-savvy travelers and investors alike.

Leadership and Legacy: Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill

Central to this revival is Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill, CEO and Founder of Concorde Co., headquartered in Washington state. Churchill’s deeply personal connection to the Concorde legacy traces back to his lineage—his ancestor, Sir Winston Churchill, originally championed the Concorde as a post-World War II peace initiative.

Dr. Churchill, holding three doctoral degrees in physics and related disciplines from the University of Oxford, has passionately committed over 23 years to overcoming the challenges of sonic boom disruption. His leadership and scientific acumen have been instrumental in bringing the Concorde back into the skies, underscoring the significance of innovation-driven, sustainable aviation solutions.

Global Impact and Economic Potential

According to recent projections by aerospace analysts, the Concorde brand—already synonymous with prestige—is now estimated to be worth approximately $50 billion. The revival is expected not only to boost the global aviation industry but also to generate substantial economic impact in regions connected by these supersonic routes, revitalizing tourism and international business.

Government agencies and regulatory bodies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) are actively collaborating to streamline certification processes for the Concorde’s return to service. Both agencies emphasize safety, sustainability, and community acceptance as cornerstones of this new era in aviation.

Conclusion: The Future is Supersonic

While all over the world, fans are itching for its return, the new Concorde represents much more than nostalgia itself—it represents ultimate sustainable aviation technology, luxurious travel, and cutting-edge digital finance innovation. Ideally blending its timeless heritage with forward-looking innovation, Concorde will redefine travel worldwide once again and show how sustainability and luxury can coexist and thrive at supersonic speeds.

IATA Launches SAF Matchmaker for Airlines, Suppliers

Geneva – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced the release of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform, to facilitate SAF procurement between airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with offers. When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

Specifically, the SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

""To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,"" said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA's Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

The SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as offtake agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only. In due course, other SAF buyers such as non-aviation corporations will also be able to participate.

The SAF Matchmaker is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, a centralized digital space designed to provide the aviation industry with access to practical tools that support aviation energy management.

The in-house labs serve as hubs for AI-centric innovation and collaboration, focusing on aircraft maintenance, customer service, and overall airline operations.

Better Aircraft Maintenance Workflows

The new engine maintenance scheduling tool uses “algorithms to assess millions of different scenarios, each one tailored to factor in operational, financial or technical assumptions, and identify the optimal maintenance schedule for its fleets,” according to aviationweek.com.

The system is being tested on Aer Lingus’ (EI) A320 CFM56-5B engines, and IAG expects the system to be rolled out to its other airlines by the end of the year.

The goal of the IAG fleet maintenance scheduling overhaul is to prevent maintenance delays, thereby addressing the ever-present engine supply chain issues, as airlines and MROs are struggling to obtain essential engine parts, including materials like titanium and high-pressure turbine blades.

Intergrating AI into the MRO workflow can decrease costs, shorten lead times and compensate for labor shortages. We know that due to scarcity, prices for engine parts have surged, and with procurement of parts is taking longer, lead times for some components can extend to months. Finally, there is a shortage of skilled labor in the aerospace industry, further complicating maintenance and repair processes.

IAGi Accelerator Program

Last March, IAG opened applications for its IAGi Accelerator 2025 program, formerly called Hangar 51. The program’s goal is to identify and test ideas that can solve challenges across the aviation industry.

This year’s accelerator is focused on start-ups specialising in AI, “automation, sustainability, customer-focused platforms, connectivity, and next-generation computing technology,” aiming to streamline operational efficiencies, boost productivity, and enhance the customer journey across IAG’s operating companies.

This year, the program offers two pathways:

Deploy: During this 12-week accelerator, participants will collaborate with experts from one of IAG’s five airlines or two complementary businesses to conduct a proof-of-value and test their technology under operational conditions.

AeroMorning: Mark, can you tell us about the purpose and characteristics of the WindRunner aircraft?

Mark Lundstrom:

The WindRunner aircraft is a project currently being developed by Radia, an aerospace and clean-energy technology company based in Boulder, Colorado, and founded in 2016.

The primary purpose of the WindRunner is to transport wind turbine blades, specifically enabling onshore wind turbines to use blades as long as offshore ones—up to 105 meters in length. Today, onshore turbine blades are typically limited to around 70 meters, as roads and infrastructure can’t accommodate longer blades. Extending onshore blade lengths significantly boosts green energy production efficiency, lowers energy costs, and reduces the land area needed for wind farms.

The WindRunner will be the largest aircraft in the world under development. It features four engines, a length of 108 meters, a wingspan of 80 meters, and has 12 times the internal volume of a Boeing 747.

In terms of performance, WindRunner can land on semi-prepared airstrips as short as 1,800 meters, carrying a maximum payload of 72 metric tonnes.

Thanks to its unique capabilities, WindRunner is expected to have many applications beyond transporting wind turbine blades. These include moving military hardware (such as F-16s or Chinook helicopters), delivering disaster relief equipment, launching satellites, and transporting other oversized cargo anywhere in the world. Radia envisions a fleet of aircraft to meet global demand.

To mitigate development and cost risks, WindRunner is being designed using proven, certified, and mass-produced technologies. There will be no prototype phase—the project will move directly to a certification aircraft, to be certified under FAA Part 25.

The supply chain is already well-integrated, with most of the key suppliers selected. Most of the structural parts will be sourced from Europe:

Wings and engine pylons – Aernnova (Spain)

Fuselage – Leonardo (Italy)

Empennage – Aciturri (Spain)

Landing gear – Magnaghi (Italy)

Testing and certification will be carried out by Radia with other international partners, with program management handled by Radia in Boulder, Colorado.

Initially, the WindRunner will run on conventional jet fuel, but the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is planned in the second phase, once it becomes widely available and economically viable.

In summary, WindRunner is more than a transportation tool—it’s an enabler for a more sustainable world. By making large-scale onshore wind turbines feasible, it helps reduce the concrete and materials required, cuts energy costs, and increases clean energy output to power high-demand infrastructure like AI data centers or to produce green fuels like SAF in greater volumes and at lower prices.

With WindRunner, Radia is playing a key role in building a cleaner, greener future.

In this way, green energy is not just a climate imperative but an economic opportunity, one that brings capital investment, job creation, and export potential to American soil.","As the global economy accelerates toward a lower-carbon future, few voices carry the pragmatic clarity and cross-border vision that Suneet Singal brings to the table. A business leader and sustainability advocate with a forward-leaning approach to infrastructure and clean energy, Singal is helping to define how the United States can emerge not just as a domestic clean energy leader but as an exporter of American-made green technologies, fuels, and expertise to meet global mandates.

Within this ethos is a strong belief in free-market innovation, profitability, and American energy independence, ideals that resonate deeply with conservative principles while aligning with broader climate goals.

The Southern United States, often associated with traditional energy production, now stands at the intersection of tradition and transformation. With its rich biomass reserves, rail and port infrastructure, and globally leading carbon sequestration hubs, the region is positioned to become a powerhouse in the green energy supply chain. Singal sees immense value in tapping into this potential, not just to serve domestic carriers and industries looking to reduce their emissions, but also to build export pipelines to nations whose emissions mandates have already taken effect.

It's a compelling proposition for Republican lawmakers and conservative-minded investors: create jobs at home, build critical infrastructure in America's heartland, and use US-grown technologies to compete on a global stage. Singal understands this alignment well. His work bridges business with policy in a way that encourages private-sector growth while supporting national interests. Rather than chasing tax incentives, Singal's model focuses on unit economics by delivering clean fuels, such as green methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), at competitive prices.

Singal's commitment to export-led growth reflects a broader view of America's role in the global energy transition. While Europe is deepening its decarbonization regulations and Asia is ramping up its demand for clean fuels, the United States, under the right leadership, can be the one to supply them.

""We can build globally competitive facilities in the US, leveraging America's biomass abundance, skilled labor, and advanced logistics to deliver profitable solutions abroad. We now have an opportunity where we don't have to be just consumers of the green transition, we can be the suppliers"". Commented Singal.

This strategy also offers an answer to one of the most asked questions in climate policy: how to align environmental responsibility with fiscal discipline. For conservative stakeholders, Singal's approach offers a path that rewards efficiency, innovation, and entrepreneurial drive.

Projects rooted in the US can be designed to meet both global emission standards and market demands. In this way, green energy is not just a climate imperative but an economic opportunity, one that brings capital investment, job creation, and export potential to American soil.

Carbon capture and sequestration stands out as a key player in Singal's blueprint. The Southern US already boasts some of the most advanced geological formations for long-term CO₂ storage. According to the Global CCS Institute, the US leads the world in operational CCS facilities, with more than 20 active commercial-scale projects. Many of these are concentrated in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.

These sites are essential not only for capturing emissions from traditional industries but also for enabling low-carbon fuel production. By capturing and storing CO₂ from biofuel facilities, for example, producers can generate net-negative emissions fuels, highly attractive to international buyers facing carbon pricing regimes.

But the global opportunity extends beyond fuel. Singal's vision includes not only shipping green methanol or SAF to global partners, but also building localized versions of US facilities abroad. This decentralized-yet-connected system allows the United States to retain intellectual and economic leadership in clean tech, even as it supports the development of greener supply chains overseas.

""It is not a zero-sum game between economic strength and environmental stewardship. With the right strategies and incentives, the two can reinforce each other. America can build at home and serve abroad. It can meet domestic needs while shaping global standards. We can also do this without abandoning our values, but by elevating them, turning competition, innovation, and independence into the cornerstones of climate leadership.""

Yesterday’s Fryer Oil, Tomorrow’s Flight

U.S. kitchens pour out ≈ 3 billion lb of used cooking oil (UCO) every year. Airlines want it: up to 80 % of all new SAF in the next five years will be made through the HEFA pathway that relies on UCO, cutting lifecycle emissions as much as 80 % compared with Jet A. Our own Grease Connections drivers see the demand firsthand: South Florida tankers now head straight from our Miami depot to a nearby HEFA refinery every Friday. The message is simple: when you keep oil clean, you help fuel the next departure board and earn for it.

Five Stops from Kitchen to Cockpit

A typical quick service restaurant produces about 35 lb oil/day. Here’s where Grease Connections steps in:

Cool & pour into a lidded tank: our techs remind crews never to top past 75 % to leave room for expansion.

Smart pickup: our trucks scan the tank tag; a digital manifest hits your inbox before we roll out.

Pre treatment at a regional hub; solids skimmed in under 20 minutes thanks to our heated centrifugal units.

Refinery gate: UCO enters hydroprocessing, stripping oxygen and isomerizing chains to jet spec molecules.

Blend & fly: 865 000 + commercial flights have already used SAF.

What’s Your Oil Worth Today?

USDA spot sheets list yellow grease at $0.33 to $0.45 / lb this week, driving an underground market. One Missouri thief siphoned 258 gal in a single night, nearly $1 000 in diesel equivalent value. Grease Connections curbs that risk with locked lids and GPS sealed pickups; our Orlando district hasn’t lost a gallon since switching to tamper proof hatches last year. Beyond cash, each gallon of UCO based biodiesel can generate LCFS credits; Florida is tightening those rules to push prices higher. Expect the new federal 45Z clean fuel credit to add even more upside when it starts in 2025.

Stay Compliant, Stay Open

EPA’s FOG guide bans any drain disposal and requires documented pickups. NFPA 96 caps unprotected indoor storage at 60 gal for Class IIIB liquids. Grease Connections’ technicians install secondary containment trays that slide out for quick wash downs: health inspectors in Miami tell us it’s the fastest way to ace surprise visits. Our manifests meet cradle to grave traceability rules, a growing focus after reports of fraudulent UCO imports.

How We Beat Grease Bandits

Field lesson: illuminated enclosures plus our steel “shark tooth” lids cut attempted siphoning by 60 % at a Dallas diner row last quarter. Cameras help prosecution, but speed helps more: our average pump out takes five minutes, leaving nothing for thieves. If an overnight spill happens, absorbent socks from our spill kit bag stop oil before it reaches drains; every new customer gets one free at signup.

Choosing the Right Tank: Grease Connections’ Picks

Inside the Refinery: Where Oil Turns to SAF

Hydrotreating removes oxygen; isomerization tailors freeze points. HEFA is still the only fully commercial SAF route, supplying 80 % of today’s volumes. For every 1 000 gal processed, lifecycle CO₂ drops roughly 70 t compared with petroleum jet A. Grease Connections contracts guarantee our loads head to SAF, not lower value diesel, so your waste truly helps aviation decarbonize.

ESG Story Your Customers Will Love

One fast food location recycling with us diverts 12 000 + lb of oil a year (based on our Atlanta route logs). We bundle annual recycling reports you can post on menu boards or RFPs: proof that your fries help power flights, not landfills.

And then you may start to wonder why flying is still so dependent on fossil fuels, and whether you should have booked a holiday destination that’s accessible by a more environmentally friendly form of transport.

So what happened to plans for so-called sustainable aviation fuel? Wasn’t it supposed to be the “game changer” that would make flying a much greener travel option than it used to be?

Clearly, the move to adopt the technology is facing difficulties. One problem seems to be that there simply isn’t enough sustainable fuel to go around.

But the business side of the process is also holding back sustainable fuel uptake.

Research my colleagues and I conducted in 2021 revealed a deeply fragmented landscape at pretty much every step of sustainable fuel development. There are obstacles everywhere, blocking the paths of the producers developing these fuels, the airlines who might use them and the governmental and campaign groups pushing for change.

Everyone seems to agree that sustainable fuel matters. They just don’t all agree about how to really get it off the ground.

Our findings demonstrate that producers, for instance, were understandably focused on more research and development to improve efficient production. They were also worried that scaling up facilities could disrupt production that is already in place.

Airlines meanwhile, are grappling with the economics of moving to sustainable fuel, which is around three to ten times more expensive than conventional fuel. Right now, a litre of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per litre in the UK – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97. (Depending on the length of the journey and the size of the engine, a plane could need around 13,000 litres per hour of flying.)

They spoke about inconsistent supply (especially at major airports), and the need for clearer regulations and incentives across the industry.

“Cost is clearly the most important driver,” one airline executive told us, explaining that dealing with those costs would ultimately depend on passenger demand for greener travel – and how willing those passengers are to pay a premium for sustainable fuel.

Distribution companies that take the sustainable fuel where it needs to go, have found themselves struggling to navigate the complexities of an emerging supply chain. They spoke of the logistical challenges of transporting and storing sustainable fuel, and a lack of clear communication between producers and airlines.

They saw themselves as a crucial part of the sustainable aviation fuel puzzle, but were concerned about investing in logistics and infrastructure without guaranteed demand.

Elsewhere, politicians and climate campaigners tend to view the adoption of sustainable fuel from a broader perspective, stressing the urgency of action on climate change. Their thinking is dominated by environmental strategy and sustainable aviation fuel regulation.

But here, trust becomes an issue. Some of those involved with sustainable fuel development said they doubted government promises to support the sector over the long term. Others are cynical about whether airlines will really prioritise climate action over their very tight profit margins.

Up in the air

So sustainable fuel inspires plenty of different viewpoints and concerns. But one common thread was an overwhelming concern about cost and scale of production.

Aside from being far more expensive than fossil-based jet fuel, building enough production facilities to make more will require billions of pounds of investment.

The big question is who will foot the bill.

Some of this will need to be tax funded. For if the UK wants to become a leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel, as the government says it does, it needs more than ambitious targets. It needs to start making things happen.

And our research suggests that the industry as a whole would benefit from some certainty to encourage investment right across the supply chain. Without a clear and stable regulatory framework, everyone will remain hesitant about committing significant resources to sustainable fuel.

Collaboration between the key players could also be improved, with a better dialogue between those in the industry and regulators, potentially leading to a shared vision for the future of sustainable aviation fuel.

That future is by no means doomed. Major commercial airlines like Air France-KLM, IAG (British Airways) and United Airlines in the US are working with sustainable fuel producers around the world.

But while the desire to decarbonise aviation seems clear, the path forward is not straightforward. It is a complex picture of politics, economics, trust and differing priorities.

By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero. But if managed poorly, targets to dramatically increase its use will remain elusive.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/676581/original/file-20250625-56-arar05.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=444%2C1508%2C4721%2C2360&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-26 13:08:12.984414

An ABF spokesperson said:

“We are extremely pleased to be entering the next phase of formal negotiations with Government over the future of Vivergo.

We believe it is a very positive signal that Government recognises the strategic importance of a domestic bioethanol industry, and is serious about working with the sector to find a sustainable long-term future. We look forward to engaging intensively and constructively with ministers over the coming weeks.

ABF cannot continue to absorb losses at the plant. That is why a timely solution is vital. Our clear preference is to find that solution through this process and to get back to running a business that can thrive in the long term.

In parallel, we have entered into a consultation process with our employees - a necessary step given there can be no guarantee that the negotiations with Government will be successful. Our employees are our most important consideration, and we will engage with them properly and transparently about the future. Consultation is not a fixed outcome - and closure is not a certainty. The outcome depends on the progress we are able to make through negotiations with the Government. Our goal is for that outcome to be positive.

We want to keep Vivergo operating. We have invested hundreds of millions of pounds in it. We have fought hard to save it - and the potential ahead is enormous. Just days ago, we signed a £1.25 billion Memorandum of Understanding with Meld Energy to anchor a world-class Sustainable Aviation Fuel facility at the site. There is a real opportunity for Hull to be home to one of Britain’s most exciting clean fuel clusters.

ABF has always been and remains a long-term UK investor with a consistent record of supporting UK industry and jobs. We are committed to playing a lasting role in the country’s green industrial future.”

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), an industry group that represents 350 global airlines, has created a new online platform to match airlines with sustainable fuel companies.

The new matchmaker platform is designed to streamline the complicated and expensive process airlines must endure in order to find a sustainable fuel provider that suits their needs. Air carriers can submit their requests on the platform, and fuel providers can then follow up with their supply details. When there’s a match, the companies can take their discussion offline to hammer out details like pricing and payment terms.

IATA says the central database was designed in order to facilitate more voluntary purchases of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The organization has set an ambitious goal for the air travel industry to operate on a carbon neutral basis in less than 30 years.

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president sustainability and chief economist. “The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers.”

Sustainable jet fuel currently only makes up 0.3% of jet fuel use around the globe, according to a recent report by the World Travel and Tourism Council.

The matchmaker platform will include comprehensive details about the fuel options, including volumes of supply, type of feedstock used, location and technology of production, emissions reduction, and compliance with various regulations, such as the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive.

For now, IATA’s platform is only available to airlines and fuel suppliers. However, the organization says that in due time, the database will open up to other non-aviation corporations who wish to participate.

In addition to making sustainable fuel options more accessible, IATA’s plan to achieve net zero emissions includes using other technologies, like those that remove and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

But the Department for Transport has been accused of undermining domestic bioethanol producers by awarding green energy subsidies to American producers that make the chemical from waste, which is seen as more eco-friendly.

ABF is asking for an end to the green energy certificates being awarded to American producers.","Ministers are racing to save Britain’s largest bioethanol plant after the owner warned it would be forced to close the site without state intervention.

On Thursday, Associated British Foods (ABF) said it had entered into last-ditch talks with the Government about securing support for its Vivergo Fuels business in Hull, which is losing £3m a month.

Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, also confirmed he was engaging “in good faith” with the company and could commit taxpayer money to a rescue package.

If the negotiations fail, ABF’s bosses have threatened to close the factory by Sept 13.

The company has accused ministers of rendering its business unprofitable by awarding subsidies to rival American producers.

Bosses had previously warned they would decide this week whether to close the plant, which makes bioethanol for blending into petrol and employs around 150 people.

But ABF said it had entered “formal negotiations” about whether the site could be kept going. It is understood that the decision follows an intervention by Mr Reynolds.

The Government’s offer to the company remains unclear. But ABF is demanding “short-term funding of Vivergo’s losses” as well as a longer-term deal to put its plant on a profitable footing again.

In a move that piled further pressure on ministers, the company warned: “Given the outcome of the negotiations is uncertain, Vivergo is simultaneously beginning consultation with employees to effect an orderly wind-down.”

The plant, which can produce 420,000m litres of bioethanol per year, had already stopped ordering wheat feedstock, it added.

Losing the facility would leave the UK more reliant on foreign imports and dent ambitions for domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel.

The chemicals sector is described as one of several “foundation industries” in the industrial strategy published by ministers on Monday.

A spokesman for the Government said ABF’s latest ultimatum was “disappointing to see”, while Mr Reynolds described it as “premature”.

Mr Reynolds told journalists: “We have secured a mandate across government to negotiate with them.

“That means we’re willing to engage with them and potentially put government money into a restructure to make sure they’ve got a strong future.

“We have met them many times. We’ve engaged the consultants and we’re well into the process.

“Frankly, I really do regret the Vivergo’s decision to start consultations to let the workforce go and close the plant.”

Only two plants in the UK make bioethanol, which is most commonly blended with petrol to make greener fuels such as E5 and E10.

The vast majority of production uses primary feedstocks such as sugar crops or wheat that are processed to yield fermentable sugars that are then converted into ethanol. Because the fuel is made from plants, it is regarded as renewable.

But the Department for Transport has been accused of undermining domestic bioethanol producers by awarding green energy subsidies to American producers that make the chemical from waste, which is seen as more eco-friendly.

ABF and domestic competitor Ensus say ministers then compounded the problem by striking a trade deal with the US that grants American bioethanol producers tariff-free access to the UK market.

The trade deal has not yet taken effect but ABF says its plant in Hull is already unprofitable and cannot be sustained. It has already written £700m off its value.

Ensus, which runs the country’s only other bioethanol plant, has similarly warned that its facility in Teesside is at risk.

Previous talks between the companies and the Government had not made serious progress.

But it is understood that Mr Reynolds and Heidi Alexander, the Transport Secretary, met company bosses on Tuesday and that the Government has brought in consultants to examine ABF’s proposed rescue package.

It turns out that restaurants, street food stalls and home cooks in Malaysia — which is “among the world’s leading suppliers of both UCO and virgin palm oil” — will pay less for fresh cooking oil than the international market will pay for used cooking oil.
Fresh cooking oil is more useful to cooks than used cooking oil (it tastes better), but it is less useful to refiners and airlines than used cooking oil (it doesn’t reduce their carbon impact).
Virgin palm oil can be substituted for used cooking oil and voila!
Malaysia exports far more “used” cooking oil than oil that it uses.","The ever-excellent Matt Levine points us to the amusing economic policies that connect the international jet-set to Malaysian street hawkers of fried noodles. The EU and the US have created strong economic incentives to create sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and a good way to do this is to recycle used cooking oil (UCO). What could be better, right? Take a waste product and turn it into jet fuel! The EU and US policies, however, are so strong that all the EU and US used cooking oil cannot meet the demand. Here’s a great sentence, “Europe simply cannot collect enough used cooking oil to fly its planes.”

In the US, credits under the Inflation Reduction Act can account for up to $1.75 to $1.85 per gallon of SAF. Meanwhile cooking oil is subsidized in some parts of the world. The result?

It turns out that restaurants, street food stalls and home cooks in Malaysia — which is “among the world’s leading suppliers of both UCO and virgin palm oil” — will pay less for fresh cooking oil than the international market will pay for used cooking oil. Fresh cooking oil is more useful to cooks than used cooking oil (it tastes better), but it is less useful to refiners and airlines than used cooking oil (it doesn’t reduce their carbon impact). Also fresh cooking oil is subsidized by the government in Malaysia: “Subsidised cooking oil sells for RM2.50 per kg versus the UCO trading price of up to RM4.50 per kg.” So if you run a restaurant, you can buy fresh cooking oil for about $0.60 (USD), use it to fry food a few times, and then sell it to a refiner for $1, which is a nice little subsidy for the difficult, risky, low-margin business of running a restaurant.

The noodle hawkers in Kuala Lumpur are getting a nice little bump in profit but who is going stall to stall to check that the oil is in fact used? And what counts as used? One fry or two? Clever entrepreneurs have cut out the middleman. Virgin palm oil can be substituted for used cooking oil and voila! Sustainable aviation fuel is contributing to deforestation in Malaysia. Malaysia exports far more “used” cooking oil than oil that it uses. No surprise.

All of this illustrates a broader point: externalities suggest policy interventions may improve outcomes but markets are complex and politics is blunt. It’s easy to make things worse. If intervention is necessary, a uniform carbon tax beats a patchwork of production-specific subsidies. A price is a signal wrapped up in an incentive. Send everyone the same signal and the same incentive to ensure that the cheapest emissions are cut first and total costs are minimized.

Crucially, a carbon tax rewards any effective solution, even ones a planner would never think of–lighter planes and cleaner fuels sure but also operational tweaks like jet washes. In contrast, subsidies tether policy to specific technologies, like used cooking oil. That invites rent-seeking and inefficiency.

Tax carbon, not inputs. Avoid games with paperwork. One verification point at the fuel supply point is simpler than tracing global waste-oil chains. Don’t subsidize the fry oil and audit the street hawkers. Tax the emissions.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RNbmR40xThM/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEhCK4FEIIDSFryq4qpAxMIARUAAAAAGAElAADIQj0AgKJD&rs=AOn4CLCM2ybrzB3Y9w8WkND8UK8ZnmAVSA,N,,2025-06-26 12:22:39.293902

Pratt & Whitney Canada and German aircraft manufacturer, Deutsche Aircraft, have marked a major milestone in the advancement of regional aviation with an update to the D328eco regional turboprop. Featured at the 2025 Paris Air Show following the May rollout of the first test aircraft, the TAC 1, the D328eco program takes a significant step forward from design to hands-on testing, with the goal of achieving type certification and Entry Into Service (EIS) by late 2027.

Driving the advancement of the D328eco is the new Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127XT-S engine – a state-of-the-art turboprop that’s been engineered to meet the operational demands of regional carriers. Boasting up to 15 per cent improved fuel efficiency, 40 per cent longer time on wing, and 20 per cent lower maintenance costs when compared to the D328’s legacy engine, the PW127XT-S represents a significant improvement to lifecycle and reliability.

It’s an advancement and impact that aren’t lost on Pratt & Whitney Canada President, Maria Della Posta, who also recognizes the position that the global leader in aerospace engine design and manufacturing is in to be able to drive innovation within the space further.

“For over 40 years, we’ve been dedicated to supporting regional airlines by understanding their unique needs,” she says. “With the PW127XT engine family, we’ve developed a solution that reduces maintenance and operating costs, delivering significant value to our customers.”

In addition, progress and innovation around the updated aircraft extends beyond the airframe. In late 2024, the two aerospace manufacturers entered into a joint synthetic fuel test campaign using the D328 UpLift demonstrator in collaboration with the German Aerospace Center. The five-flight series, which used 100 per cent synthetic Fischer-Tropsch fuel, demonstrated the propulsion system’s performance under alternative fuel conditions, supporting the goal of achieving certification for the D328eco for 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel use.

(Reuters) -Associated British Foods said it would close the UK’s largest bioethanol plant by September if the government does not provide support and funding, potentially the first victim of Britain’s tariff deal with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Under last month’s trade deal, the UK’s 19% tariffs on U.S. ethanol will fall to zero, through a 1.4 billion-litre (370 million gallon) quota – a figure equating to the size of the UK’s entire ethanol market.

The possible closure would be an embarrassment for Prime Minister Keir Starmer who hailed the trade deal as a boost to businesses that would protect jobs and attract investment.

It also underscores how Trump’s assault on trade is being felt around the world, with the closure set to affect the production of byproducts including animal feed and carbon dioxide, and British arable farmers which supply the industry.

Bioethanol is produced from crops such as wheat and is used to make petrol greener and to make sustainable aviation fuel. On Monday, Starmer’s government launched its industrial strategy, promising to invest in the green economy.

Britain has two major bioethanol plants in northern England – AB Foods’ Vivergo plant and one operated by Ensus, owned by Germany’s Sudzucker Group – which account for nearly all of the UK’s production capacity.

They have warned that the trade deal, along with existing regulations that give U.S. producers an advantage in the British market, has made the environment impossible. The industry supports thousands of jobs.

Ensus, which has warned its Teesside plant also faces imminent closure, on Thursday welcomed the appointment of external advisers to work with the industry, and said it would work with the government “urgently”.

LEVEL THE REGULATORY PLAYING FIELD

AB Foods said on Thursday it would begin consultations with employees for an orderly wind-down of its plant, while simultaneously continuing talks with the government, which it said is now committed to reaching “a sustainable solution”.

It said it would cease all manufacturing before September 13, its financial year-end, “unless the government is able to provide both short-term funding of Vivergo’s losses and a longer-term solution.”

A spokesperson for the government said it was disappointed with AB Foods’ announcement, having entered into negotiations with the company on financial support on Wednesday.

The government would “present a plan for a way forward that protects supply chains, jobs and livelihoods,” the spokesperson added.

AB Foods wants the government to increase the amount of ethanol in UK petrol from 10% to 15% and support the development of sustainable aviation fuel.

It also wants the industry to have access to short-term financial aid of up to 150 million pounds ($202 million).

Britain’s concession on ethanol was made in return for the removal of 25% additional tariffs on steel and aluminium, and a quota of 100,000 cars at a duty of 10%.

Concorde Supersonic Jet to Return by 2026

After decades of silence, Concorde is on track to become the world’s leading supersonic passenger aircraft once again.

The recently signed executive order clears regulatory airspace that had long blocked overland supersonic travel due to sonic boom and environmental concerns. The new legislation positions the U.S. as a leader in next-generation aerospace innovation and sustainability.

The new Concorde will remain true to its iconic silhouette but will be 50% lighter and use advanced composite materials and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), cutting emissions by 80%.

It will cruise at 60,000 feet, significantly higher than conventional commercial jets, while operating faster, quieter, and cleaner than the original.

The interior will reflect minimalist Japanese aesthetics, developed by leading sustainable architects. Every feature, from cabin design to propulsion systems, will incorporate cutting-edge aerospace technologies rooted in decades of research and development.

Leadership, Legacy, and Supersonic Breakthroughs

At the helm of this supersonic revival is Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill, CEO and Founder of The Concorde Co., based in Washington state.

A triple PhD from Oxford and an expert physicist, Dr. Churchill is credited with solving the long-standing sonic boom challenge. His patented Sonic Boom Suppression technology, granted in May 2025, enables Concorde to fly overland without disturbing ground-level communities.

Dr. Churchill is a direct descendant of Sir Winston Churchill, whose original Concorde initiative was launched as a post-World War II peace project. Now, his legacy continues through the rebirth of this aviation legend, targeted for launch on its 50th anniversary.

Patricia Bader-Johnston, Vice President and Chief Development Officer at Fly-Concorde Limited, emphasizes the aircraft’s broader vision: “Concorde is set to become the global benchmark for sonic boom suppression and sustainability.”

Financial Innovation

Fly-Concorde is also innovating on the financial front. It has introduced Concorde Coin (CSSC), a stablecoin backed by Concorde’s aviation assets and operations.

With blockchain technology gaining global traction, CSSC is designed to attract investors aligned with futuristic, environmentally responsible air travel ventures.

This digital currency initiative aims to fund development while enabling broader engagement in Concorde’s mission. The move reflects growing synergy between aerospace advancement and decentralized finance.

Globally recognized as a pinnacle of aviation excellence, the Concorde brand is now valued at approximately $50 billion. The upcoming relaunch aims to restore its reputation as the epitome of luxury air travel, now aligned with modern values of environmental stewardship, digital innovation, and safety.

History of the Supersonic Era

The Concorde, a joint marvel by British Airways (BA) and Air France (AF), revolutionized high-speed air travel with its supersonic performance. Operating primarily between London Heathrow (LHR), Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), and New York John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK), Concorde represented the peak of technological ambition in commercial aviation.

The aircraft’s inaugural transatlantic flight occurred on September 26, 1973, marking a new era of rapid travel. Despite initial global fascination, the Concorde’s commercial future was constrained by high operational costs, limited routes, and its eventual involvement in a fatal accident in 2000.

Birth of a Supersonic Dream

Concorde’s development began with the 1962 treaty between France and the UK, aiming to share the cost and innovation challenges of producing a supersonic transport (SST).

British Aerospace and Aérospatiale collaborated on the aircraft’s frame, while Rolls-Royce and SNECMA developed its powerful Olympus 593 engines. This cooperation marked a defining moment in European aerospace engineering.

After its maiden flight on March 2, 1969, the Concorde entered commercial service on January 21, 1976. British Airways (BA) initially operated the London (LHR) to Bahrain route, and Air France (AF) flew from Paris (CDG) to Rio de Janeiro (GIG). Shortly after, both airlines launched regular services to Washington Dulles (IAD) and New York JFK (JFK), offering transatlantic flights in under three and a half hours.

Although capable of cruising at Mach 2.04 (2,179 km/h), the Concorde was never economically viable. Only 14 production aircraft entered commercial service, with persistent financial losses leading to route reductions until JFK remained the only regular destination. The aircraft’s sonic boom and high noise levels also restricted route expansion.

Tupolev Tu-144, Copy of Concorde?

The Tupolev Tu-144, the world’s first supersonic transport (SST) aircraft, was a milestone in Soviet aerospace engineering. Designed by legendary aircraft designer Andrey N. Tupolev and his son Alexey, the Tu-144 symbolized the USSR’s ambition to lead in high-speed aviation during the Cold War era.

First flown in December 1968 and surpassing Mach 1 in June 1969, the Tu-144 predated Concorde’s first supersonic flight. It was publicly unveiled in Moscow in May 1970 and stood as a technological marvel with futuristic design elements and record-breaking performance.

Despite its technical achievements, the Tu-144’s career was marred by high-profile incidents. A tragic crash during a demonstration at the 1973 Paris Air Show raised early concerns. Though the aircraft began mail service on the Moscow–Alma-Ata route in 1975 and passenger service in 1978, another fatal crash that same year led to its commercial withdrawal.

Only 55 passenger flights were completed before Aeroflot ceased its SST operations. The aircraft’s high operating costs, limited range, and reliability issues made it commercially unsustainable.

While its commercial role was short-lived, later Tu-144 variants were used in experimental flight programs. Notably, in the 1990s, a modified Tu-144LL flew under a joint Russian-American program to advance next-generation supersonic transport technology.

Final Years and Grounding

On July 25, 2000, Air France Flight 4590 (AF4590), a Concorde departing from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) to New York JFK, crashed shortly after takeoff.

A burst tire punctured a fuel tank, igniting a fire that led to engine failure. The aircraft crashed into a nearby hotel in Gonesse, France, killing all 109 on board and 4 on the ground.

This tragedy, combined with growing maintenance costs and declining passenger numbers, marked the beginning of the end.

Air France retired its Concorde fleet in May 2003, and British Airways followed in October 2003, officially concluding the era of supersonic commercial aviation.

The bunkering was conducted by the Hai Gang Zhi Yuan tanker, the nation's first and largest methanol bunkering vessel in operation.","The nation's first batch of large-scale green methane will be produced and applied in bunkering a commercial logistics vessel in July, marking the fact that a closed-loop from R&D to application of this clean fuel has been established, according to a senior executive of the green methane producer.

A demonstration project located in Taonan in Northeast China's Jilin province is expected to produce the first barrel of green methanol in July, which will subsequently be transported to Shanghai Port to bunker the commercial logistics vessels under French shipping and logistics group CMA CGM, according to Ni Jianjun, deputy general manager of Shanghai Boiler Works Co Ltd, a unit of Shanghai Electric Group Co Ltd.

""The Taonan site has an annual production capacity of 50,000 metric tons, and we have plans to build more capacity to meet soaring market demand,"" said Ni.

As a type of clean and renewable energy, green methanol is produced mainly from renewable energies featuring high efficiency, clean emission, renewability, easy storage and transportation convenience.

Despite rising demand for green transition across the global shipping industry, production capability of clean energies remains limited.

Throughout 2024, orders for 515 vessels using alternative fuels including liquefied natural gas (LNG) and methanol were placed, up 38 percent year-on-year, with 166 ships to be powered by methanol, reported the Shanghai-based newspaper Jiefang Daily citing data from international certification and classification body DNV.

Among the 180 million tons of methanol produced worldwide in 2023, merely 500,000 are green methanol, including some 300,000 tons produced in China, according to a Shanghai Observer report.

According to Ni, apart from the Taonan project, a much bigger project with an annual production capacity of 200,000 tons of methanol is in the pipeline.

What's noteworthy is that all the core technologies and key equipment used in the Taonan project are researched and developed by Shanghai Electric, Ni added.

""CMA CGM's demand for green methanol is much bigger than the 50,000 tons we are going to provide. In fact, there is a supply shortage in terms of green methanol globally,"" Ni said.

Public information shows the demand for green methanol is projected to surpass 10 million tons by 2030, while production is only approaching 500,000 tons annually for the moment.

In addition to the innovative application of green energy in the shipping industry, Shanghai Electric has plans to develop sustainable aviation fuel and will continue to introduce more green fuel solutions for various sectors, Ni said.

On its way to building itself into an international shipping hub, the port of Shanghai is also seizing the emerging opportunities that green transition creates.

A simultaneous ship-to-ship bunkering of green methanol for dual-powered container ship HMM Green under South Korean logistics company was conducted in March at Shanghai's Yangshan Port, becoming the first bunkering of domestically produced green methanol, according to Shanghai International Port (Group) Co Ltd.

The bunkering was conducted by the Hai Gang Zhi Yuan tanker, the nation's first and largest methanol bunkering vessel in operation. In comparison with the bunkering conducted by Hai Gang Zhi Yuan for Danish shipping and logistics services provider A.P.Moller-Maersk's Astrid Maersk in April 2024, the latest bunkering involves a greater amount of green methanol, about 2,900 tons, and the green energy is produced in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region.

Indonesia is emerging as a promising destination for energy transition investments. Two of the country’s leading sovereign wealth funds have recently reaffirmed their commitment to scaling up investments in clean energy.

At the same time, the European Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia (EuroCham Indonesia) is advocating for the development of low-carbon fuels such as bioenergy, encouraging local companies to tap into global decarbonization trends to drive export-led industrial growth.

INA, Danantara target nickel processing, clean power, and grid upgrades

At the Energy Transition Forum co-hosted by the Financial Times and Nikkei on June 25, Indonesian Investment Authority (INA) and the newly established sovereign fund Danantara outlined their upcoming investment priorities, naming electric vehicle battery supply chains, solar energy, and grid modernization among key targets.

INA CEO Ridha Wirakusumah noted that renewable energy currently accounts for about 12% of INA’s US$4 billion portfolio and is expected to rise to 15–20% this year. The fund is not only supporting the early retirement of coal plants but also focusing on geothermal, solar, and waste-to-energy projects.

Ridha highlighted a solar power project under discussion that could break the record for the largest installed capacity in the country. In the EV space, INA is prioritizing nickel processing, an essential link in battery manufacturing, leveraging Indonesia’s abundant mineral resources to build a competitive position in the global EV supply chain.

In May, INA, Danantara, and French mining giant Eramet signed an MoU focused on building a domestic nickel ecosystem for EV battery materials. The agreement was witnessed by French President Emmanuel Macron and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.

Indonesia has singled out the EV battery supply chain as one of its top priorities for future investment expansion. Pictured is Former Indonesian Pictured is former president Joko Widodo at the inauguration of an EV battery plant in 2024. (Photo: MOTIE)

Foreign stakeholders urge acceleration of low-carbon fuel exports

Danantara Chief Investment Officer Pandu Sjahrir, also speaking at the forum, emphasized the fund’s dual focus on nickel processing and upgrading the national power grid. Indonesia’s outdated electricity infrastructure, originally built to serve fossil fuel plants, is now seen as a major bottleneck to renewable integration.

Danantara, launched in February under the Prabowo administration, is authorized to manage the assets of key state-owned enterprises such as the national oil company Pertamina. The fund oversees assets worth over US$900 billion and is pursuing nine strategic investment areas, including mining for battery minerals, biofuel agriculture, and renewable power.

Foreign investors see Indonesia’s vast natural resources and strategic location as offering immense export potential. Thomas Wagner, head of EuroCham Indonesia’s energy working group, recently stated at a geopolitical forum that Indonesia should move swiftly to develop low-carbon fuels, including bio-based sustainable aviation fuel and bio-methanol, which could generate up to US$8 billion annually in exports.

Wagner urged Indonesian companies to take a proactive stance in capturing surging global demand and benefiting from favorable policies. Waiting for ideal market prices or political clarity, he warned, could result in losing ground to competitors in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea.",https://reccessary.com/data/news/cover/1750918299629002775.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 08:01:24.539495

Oil and gas licensing In 2022, the UK government quietly dropped two criteria from its ‘Climate Compatibility Checkpoint’ after lobbying from the fossil fuel industry.
The checkpoint is used to assess whether proposed oil and gas licenses align with the UK’s climate change goals.
This industry lobbying has led to indecision and disruption on government plans.","The British government weakened key climate policies after fossil fuel giants lobbied ministers and used legal loopholes to avoid public scrutiny, a new report has found.

Climate-focused think tank InfluenceMap has uncovered that industry influence appears to have led to the delay and dilution of UK policies on the roll-out of heat pumps, the development of ‘sustainable’ aviation fuel and the granting of new oil and gas licenses.

In each case, it found that lobbyists representing fossil fuel actors that stood to lose billions from progressive climate regulations were able to influence the Conservative government’s policy without scrutiny.

While InfluenceMap’s report looks at policies relating to the UK’s net-zero ambitions, its findings on the way the UK’s lax laws allow lobbying to be conducted in secret can be applied across sectors. The think tank is calling for reforms to address this and close the “major transparency gap”.

The secrecy around lobbying, which has been at the heart of many government scandals in recent years, is a major driver of the disillusionment in British politics.

Three-quarters of the public believe the government is “rigged to serve the rich and influential”, according to polling conducted by More in Common and University College London’s Policy Lab last year.

InfluenceMap’s findings illustrate “how inadequate and opaque lobbying rules undermine effective policymaking”, said Alastair McCapra, the CEO of the UK lobbying industry body.

He added: “Business engagement should help to build sounder policy with better outcomes for the public, but unaccountable lobbying breeds public mistrust. This important report removes the guesswork needed to piece together what kind of lobbying is taking place.”

Weak lobbying laws

openDemocracy has previously reported extensively on the ways that the UK’s weak lobbying laws allow corporate influence to secretly shape policy.

Our investigations have now been backed up by InfluenceMap, which has found a huge gap exists between the lobbying that takes place and that which is disclosed. This means the British public often has no way of knowing who is swaying policy.

Comparing transparency rules in the UK, the European Parliament, the US, Canada and France, InfluenceMap found that the UK has by far the worst system.

Of the five, only the UK exempts lobbyists who work in-house for a company, rather than for an agency or consultancy, from registering with a statutory lobbying watchdog. Less than 15% of lobbyists working in the UK need to register because of this rule.

The firms on the register must publish a list of clients on whose behalf they have lobbied each quarter. But they do not have to publish any details about the lobbying, including whether it involved written correspondence or a meeting and what legislation or policy was discussed.

Registered lobbyists also only need to declare clients for whom they lobbied government ministers and senior officials. There is no requirement to name clients when they approached other MPs and peers, including those on select committees, or influential government advisers.

The Committee for Standards in Public Life, an independent public body that advises the prime minister on lobbying and other aspects of public office, has consistently recommended the government publish a single, searchable database of all meetings with lobbyists.

Its recommendations would expand the scope of the current register considerably, requiring lobbyists to disclose the specific policies or legislation they discussed at meetings with government ministers and special advisers.

InfluenceMap has also called on the government to take up this recommendation and address the fundamental flaws in the lobbying act by including in-house lobbyists and publishing all responses to government policy consultants as standard.

Susan Hawley, executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said the report “starkly demonstrates how major transparency gaps in the UK’s lobbying regime are undermining the development of good climate policy.”

“We fully support their recommendations to make lobbying much more transparent and bring the UK in line with international best practice. These reforms would support more participatory and open decision-making to help rebuild public trust and ensure better decision-making, widening the evidence base for policy making and reducing risks of policy capture by vested interests,” she said.

Oil and gas licensing

In 2022, the UK government quietly dropped two criteria from its ‘Climate Compatibility Checkpoint’ after lobbying from the fossil fuel industry. The checkpoint is used to assess whether proposed oil and gas licenses align with the UK’s climate change goals.

Oil giants BP and Shell and their industry association, Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), responded to a consultation on the checkpoint by objecting to the inclusion of two key metrics for measuring the impact of fossil fuels, according to InfluenceMap’s analysis of consultation responses obtained via Freedom of Information requests.

The measures they opposed would have required the government to consider ‘Scope 3 emissions’ and the ‘global production gap’ when issuing new oil and gas licences.

Scope 3 emissions are produced during end-use and contribute the largest share of all emissions from oil and gas production, while the production gap tracks the discrepancy between planned fossil fuel production and what’s needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C.

The government dropped both criteria from the final checkpoint, which instead focuses solely on operational emissions, which represent only a fraction of total emissions from oil and gas projects.

This outcome, InfluenceMap’s report notes, strongly aligns with the positions advocated for by BP, Shell, and OEUK, suggesting their lobbying efforts were successful.

The following year, the government approved 100 new North Sea oil and gas licences, which had a potential emissions footprint equivalent to Denmark’s annual output.

InfluenceMap’s report also highlights the issues around government consultations on proposed policies, pointing out that, as in this case, lobbyists typically use these to suggest amendments in favour of their clients, but their responses are not published as standard.

Similarly, unlike in the other four Parliaments InfluenceMap looked at, corporations in the UK are not required to declare their engagement on policies, how much they spend on lobbying, or which legislation or decisions they are targeting.

It highlights that this can lead to a situation in which companies make voluntary corporate disclosures that fail to capture the true extent of this advocacy. In this case, InfluenceMap found BP published a summary of its response to the checkpoint that omitted key lines of its opposition, which were only revealed later through Freedom of Information requests.

Rachel Davies, advocacy director at Transparency International UK, said: “This report highlights, yet again, the glaring gaps in our lobbying transparency regime and the potential risks of favouring a small group of vested interests at the public’s expense.

“The UK needs to catch up to other comparable democracies and act swiftly to introduce a comprehensive lobbying register with meaningful disclosures.”

Domestic hydrogen

It is broadly agreed that, in the UK, hydrogen is not a viable solution for decarbonising domestic heating and is an especially bad alternative to heat pumps. Much of our hydrogen comes from burning gas or coal and it cannot be transported through our existing pipelines without massive and costly infrastructure changes.

This reality has been set out by different independent bodies advising the UK government.

In 2021, the Climate Change Committee warned that hydrogen had “not yet been proven at scale and should not be a cause to delay other options” such as the roll-out of heat pumps or low-carbon heat networks. Two years later, the National Infrastructure Commission said the government “should not support the roll-out of hydrogen heating” because there is “no public policy case” for its use.

As InfluenceMap’s report notes, this has not prevented the gas industry from waging a successful lobbying campaign in a bid to shore up its market position – with a clear impact on government policy.

The think tank found the industry pursued its cause in a number of ways, including setting up Hello Hydrogen, a campaign fronted by TV star Rachel Riley, to make the case for using hydrogen in homes to the public in 2022. While the campaign did not declare its funders, its director was also a director of Cadent Gas, the UK’s largest gas distribution network.

Cadent is one of the funders of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Hydrogen, which has publicly called for hydrogen to play a part in domestic heating. The APPG’s other funders include Equinor, Shell and the Energy and Utilities Alliance, a lobbying body run by Mike Foster, the former Labour MP for Worcester (home to Worcester Bosch, a major manufacturer of gas boilers).

Other fossil fuel firms and industry lobbying bodies have also consistently pushed for the use of hydrogen in domestic heating in letters to parliamentary select committees and responses to government consultations.

Ahead of last year’s general election, Centrica (formerly British Gas) wrote to the Public Accounts Committee, which examines the value for money of government projects, to call for further public investment in hydrogen for home heating. The firm had written to the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee in support of the technology less than 12 months earlier.

This industry lobbying has led to indecision and disruption on government plans. A February 2023 report by the House of Lords Committee blamed mixed messages on the effectiveness of hydrogen from the government and industry for the poor uptake of a publicly subsidised scheme for heat pumps, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create many jobs.

The lords’ report concluded: “Hydrogen is not a serious option for home heating for the short to medium-term and misleading messages, including from the government, are negatively affecting take-up of established low-carbon home heating technologies like heat pumps.”

The UK’s heat pump roll-outs have lagged behind those of its neighbours. Just 55,000 heat pumps were installed in the UK in 2019, compared to 600,000 in France, according to a study cited in the InfluenceMap report.

In the UK, this reportedly created around 2,000 jobs and reduced emissions of CO₂ by 0.08 million tonnes (MT); in France 30,000 jobs were created and 0.84 MT of CO₂ emissions avoided.

‘Sustainable’ aviation fuel

InfluenceMap also uncovered how industry significantly influenced the government’s so-called ‘Jet Zero’ strategy for cutting emissions in the UK’s aviation industry, which is heavily reliant on fossil fuels.

Biofuels, largely made up of used cooking oils, are often suggested as an option for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), although they are generally accepted to be worse in terms of scalability than other, more advanced fuels, and much worse than just reducing the number of flights.

The government initially proposed limiting the use of used cooking oil for SAF to alleviate competition on the resource – which is increasingly in demand for other uses, such as producing biodiesel for cars – and to encourage investment in new technologies for the aviation industry.

The proposals included two options; either banning the use of used cooking oil for SAF altogether, or rapidly phasing down its use so that it would make up just 8.5% of total sustainable aviation fuel by 2040.

But the government’s final SAF policy was more closely aligned with industry preferences than scientific warnings, InfluenceMap found. It allows used cooking oil to make up 100% of SAF uptake in 2025 and 2026, 71% in 2030, and 35% in 2040.

InfluenceMap’s analysis reveals the weakened SAF mandate came after pressure from Shell, BP, the International Airlines Group (which owns several airlines), Airlines UK (the trade body for UK-registered airlines) and Virgin Atlantic airline.

It also found that business interests were overrepresented in parliamentary meetings on SAF while the policy was being shaped.

This can be seen in the make-up of Parliament’s Jet Zero Council, “a partnership between industry academia and government”, which was run by Heathrow’s chief operating officer, while the International Airlines Group chaired the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Delivery Group.

The council comprised 24 members from industry, three from academia and one from civil society. Ministers were also directly involved with the council, with then-prime minister Boris Johnson attending the group’s first meeting along with four ministers.

Transparency failures again played a key role. Not a single ministerial meeting on SAF referenced the weakening of the cooking oil cap in official records, and industry responses to consultations were only obtained through Freedom of Information.",https://cdn2.opendemocracy.net/media/images/GettyImages-1246268061_1.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 08:01:30.513298

Global aviation desperately needs Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Boeing’s recovery depends on successful sales of its aircraft. Below are two articles that show how these two imperatives have flowed together nicely for the

Seattle/Chicago/Arlington? company.

Boeing is seeking to sell its aircraft to Canada and India

The two countries pose prime opportunities to develop SAF

An apt term for Boeing’s substantial investment in each country’s Green Technologies while hoping to sell both members of the Commonwealth of Nations (a/k/a British Commonwealth) might be

The investment is well justified from both a financial and a environmental basis. Here are some of the explanations of the need and the challenge:

More SAF feedstocks = cheaper green fuel?

The SAF investments are absolutely critical to attaining the 2050 Global Goal of Net Zero Carbon Emissions. Contributing to target markets is a wise way to match environmental goals with sales.

Boeing Sees India as Crucial Player in Sustainable Aviation Future

India has the potential of producing 8-10 million tonnes annually, said President of Boeing India and South Asia, Salil Gupte

India can emerge as a net exporter of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and play a significant role in global green and clean aviation. Speaking at the CII Annual Business Summit 2025 in New Delhi, President of Boeing India and South Asia, Salil Gupte, highlighted that the availability of abundant feedstock like agricultural residue in India can be used for SAF production and help in the reduction of carbon emissions from the aviation sector, the Business Standard reported.

“This means that India can actually provide over 5% of the world’s SAF requirements...India can be an exporter of SAF. This creates an opportunity. This means India can help decarbonise the civil aviation industry,” said President of Boeing India and South Asia, Salil Gupte, according to BS.

SAF annual production must reach 185 million tonnes to meet the global net-zero aviation target by 2050. India, with its various kinds of feedstock, including used cooking oil and farm waste, has the potential of producing 8-10 million tonnes annually, he added.

This comes months after Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury mentioned that the aviation industry is likely to miss its carbon emissions target by 2050. Although the aircraft is working on building aircraft that is hydrogen-powered but presently it’s commercially impossible to produce them at scale. This makes SAF a more viable option for a net-zero target.

“I don’t think we are wrong to pursue net zero by 2050…Maybe it’s going to take a bit more time, but let’s not be shy in the ambition,” Airbus CEO had said, according to Bloomberg. To mitigate the emissions, he suggested the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) as an interim solution.

OTTAWA, Ontario, May 28, 2025 — Boeing will invest $17.48 million CAD to strengthen the energy security of Canada and bolster the country’s economic growth. The investments will promote the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and are part of Boeing’s Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) commitment to Canada for its selection of Boeing’s P-8A Poseidon to fulfill its long-range, multi-mission aircraft role.

The investments will support two projects:

$10 million CAD for Project Avanceopens in a new tab

A joint venture between Bioenergie AECN and Alder Renewables in Port Cartier, Quebec, to convert wood residuals from existing sawmills into a low-carbon intermediate “biocrude” that can be converted into SAF. Project Avance is forecasted to enable future projects in Quebec to produce 10 million gallons (approximately 37,854,000 liters) of unblended SAF annually.

$7.48 million CAD for Dimensional Energyopens in a new tab

The power-to-liquid technology provider will scope scaled development of its pioneering carbon utilization project to convert industrial CO2 emissions into synthetic aviation fuel production. This study will support future projects in North America to convert 500,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions to produce more than 40 million gallons (approximately 151,416,000 liters) of SAF annually.

“This significant investment in SAF production demonstrates our commitment to scaling sustainable aviation fuel and to our work in Canada, where we have driven innovation for over a century,” said Al Meinzinger, president, Boeing Canada. “With 2,000 employees across Canada, Boeing is committed to supporting Canada’s aerospace industry and domestic productivity and advancing exciting new energy innovations.”

“Our proprietary Alder Renewable Crude (ARC) product has enormous potential to fast-track the production of SAF in Canada,” said Darren Fuller, Chief Commercial Officer of Alder Renewables. “The support of Boeing and local government leaders in Quebec is supercharging our commitment to securing a low carbon future for the aviation sector. Close collaboration with our industry partners — Boeing and Bioenergie AECN — coupled with government support is essential to get to the next phase. We’re ready to play our part.”

“Making high performance hydrocarbons is an innovative use for carbon dioxide that turns unwanted waste into valuable fuels and products,” said Jason Salfi, CEO of Dimensional Energy. “This investment from Boeing provides essential predevelopment capital to catalyze projects and scale our proven power-to-liquid technology to market now.”

“Boeing’s investments in Quebec and British Columbia highlight Canada’s position as a strategic partner of choice in sustainable aviation and will generate high-value jobs and economic growth,” said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions. “The Government of Canada is committed to reducing aviation emissions and reinforcing Canada’s position as a global leader in aerospace innovation.”

The two SAF projects are part of Boeing’s over $280 million CAD investment in Canadian Clean Technology projects through the P-8 ITB program. Boeing investments will advance technologies that have the potential to unlock vast renewable resources and accelerate industries producing low-carbon fuels to meet the rising global demand. SAF has the potential today to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over the fuel’s lifecycle and offers the fastest route to decarbonization in the aviation sector.

The Government of Canada announced its decision to acquire the P-8A Poseidon aircraft in November 2023 as part of the Canadian Multi-Mission Aircraft (CMMA) project. These Boeing CMMA ITB investments build on more than $2 billion in P-8 contracts with Canadian companies to date, contributing to economic growth across the country. The purchase will generate benefits of nearly $358 CAD million annually in economic output to Canada, according to an independent study by Ottawa-based Doyletech Corporation.

They have helped us to create a meaningful offer incorporating Sustainable Aviation Fuels, starting in the German domestic market. We are confident that such ‘Sustainable Corporate Value Fare’ is going to be successful across the Business Travel ecosystem.”

Customized options for more sustainable flying with SAF

The Lufthansa Group offers several special fares for corporate customers: With the “Sustainable Corporate Value Fare”, business customers can offset up to 30% of the CO₂ emissions calculated for their individual flight through the use of SAF in flight operations. The Lufthansa Group also offers companies the opportunity to invest in larger quantities of SAF through SAF bulk deals.

Background: The use of SAF in the Lufthansa Group

There is no refueling of individual flights with pure SAF. As a so-called ""drop-in"" fuel, SAF is compatible with fossil kerosene and can be blended with it without any problems. Before being transported to the airport, SAF is blended with fossil jet fuel or produced in a process known as co-processing (joint processing of biogenic residues with fossil oil) and then fed into the airport infrastructure. The Lufthansa Group ensures that the amount of SAF required to offset individual CO2 emissions is fed into the Lufthansa Group's flight operations within six months of purchase. Over its entire life cycle, the SAF from biogenic residues used by the Lufthansa Group has a CO2 footprint that is around 80 percent lower than that of conventional kerosene made from fossil crude oil.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Lufthansa_June25_1bba5e7acd.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 00:59:14.232797

“There’s a lot of discussion around decarbonization, but more accurately this technology should be considered ‘defossilization,’” said van Fossen.
It was in Brazil where I started thinking about applying to graduate school.” START-UPS AND SUSTAINABILITY Seeing how Brazilian companies managed water and other resources inspired Van Fossen to dive deeper into the world of sustainable industry and entrepreneurship.
In the fall of 2014, she began her Ph.D. in industrial management at Cambridge’s Institute for Manufacturing.
“In my Ph.D., I studied start-ups encouraging healthier, more sustainable food consumption,” she said.","We need carbon for everything. It’s critical for fuel, but it also has applications in construction, manufacturing, even textiles.

Literally billions of tons of carbon sit in our atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), contributing to rising global temperatures and just waiting to be converted into something useful.

What if CO2 could be taken out of the atmosphere, and converted into fuel? Kirsten Van Fossen, S.B. ‘12, is trying to answer that question. She’s a postdoctoral research fellow at the Magda Barecka Lab at Northeastern University, where they’re using electrochemistry to convert CO2 into ethanol, an intermediary in the synthesis of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“There’s a lot of discussion around decarbonization, but more accurately this technology should be considered ‘defossilization,’” said van Fossen. “This is really a technology that can move us away from the reliance on fossil fuels as a source of carbon.”

Van Fossen’s research is the culmination of the last 15-plus years of her life, going all the way back to her time as an environmental science and engineering concentrator at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). It taps into the lessons she learned about sustainability, entrepreneurship and tech commercialization as a Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. and then as a department head at the foodservice data start-up Galley. And it draws on her government work with the U.S. Department of Transportation, where she was part of the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center and worked on SAF and alternative aviation fuel projects over a decade ago.

“I just feel like it’s all coming together in this opportunity working with the Barecka Lab,” she said. “I’m very drawn to the world of start-ups, building things from scratch.”

FROM BOATING TO BRAZIL

A national-caliber rower as a high school student in New Jersey, Van Fossen chose Harvard in part because of the appeal of rowing on the Charles River every day. While always planning to study engineering, she didn’t know which discipline before she got here.

“I understood that at Harvard, I could explore multiple disciplines,” she said. “Engineering was a good fit for me. It combined my passion for math and science, my love for working in a team, and gave me plenty of hands-on experience. At Harvard I became aware of the issues of climate change, the urgency, and I saw environmental engineering as the discipline that would set me up for having the most impact.”

A SEAS class on environmental chemistry and an MIT class in which she built a light sensor for a device that concentrates solar energy were some of the early experiences that convinced van Fossen that environmental engineering was the right choice. But it was her senior thesis that would prove life-changing. She designed an electrochemical filter for drinking water, and while in the lab was introduced to a visiting professor from the Universidade de São Paulo. After graduating, that professor invited her to continue her research and work on a water reuse and recycling project with him in Brazil.

“In my work in Brazil, I visited a lot of industrial sites,” she said. “That’s also what I was around as a child. My father worked at a small business called Van-Air & Hydraulics, and I remember visiting the workshop there. It was in Brazil where I started thinking about applying to graduate school.”

START-UPS AND SUSTAINABILITY

Seeing how Brazilian companies managed water and other resources inspired Van Fossen to dive deeper into the world of sustainable industry and entrepreneurship. In the fall of 2014, she began her Ph.D. in industrial management at Cambridge’s Institute for Manufacturing.

“In my Ph.D., I studied start-ups encouraging healthier, more sustainable food consumption,” she said. “I was exposed to lots of different start-ups, pitched some start-up ideas myself while I was working on my Ph.D., and I kind of caught the start-up bug.”

Within a month of finishing her Ph.D. in late 2018, Van Fossen joined Galley as Head of Customer Success. Working there for over four years, she eventually transitioned to Head of Sustainability and Education at the company, whose platform offered a range of foodservice data solutions, including inventory management, menu planning, nutritional analysisand aspirations to decrease food waste and increase sustainable food practices. When the company decided to withdraw focus on those aspirations, Kirsten moved on.

“I joined Galley as the seventh employee. In my tenure there, we grew to over a hundred people working at the organization,” she said. “I saw what it looks like for a start-up to grow rapidly, and what it takes to build up a company.”

NEW USES FOR CO2

Van Fossen has been at the Barecka Lab since November 2024. Her research draws on not only the hard science of her undergraduate days, but also the industry and entrepreneurial experiences she’s had since then. One of her major focus areas is the eventual commercialization of this technology, as well the market for other potential products that could be synthesized with the Barecka Lab’s patented technology. The lab is partially funded from a grant from the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy, with a goal of bringing the air-to-ethanol technology to market.

“I love that I can draw on that hard science background that I got from Harvard. The math, chemistry, physics that I got to study in engineering, it’s all so beautiful and practical,” she said. “With the core curriculum, I got the base that I needed to navigate lots of different work contexts. I’ve had federal government experience, academic experience, start-up experience, and I really think that base came from the work I did at Harvard.”",https://seas.harvard.edu/themes/custom/seas/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-25 20:01:49.909363

With sustainability taking a seat at the table in all our board rooms, companies need quick wins with measurable impact. Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is rapidly gaining attention with businesses whose M.O. involves regular air travel. The Film and TV industry particularly. But how impactful is SAF, and is it the environmental panacea we’ve all been hoping for?

What Exactly Is SAF?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, derived from more sustainable feedstocks. It’s incredible to think that these raw, organic materials - namely the waste from gardening, catering, sewage processing, paper making and bin collecting - can produce fuel to power aircraft. These natural by-products are processed to create a fuel with significantly reduced environmental impact over its lifecycle, compared to its fossil-based predecessors.

The Truth About CO2

When burned, SAF creates similar levels of carbon dioxide to conventional aviation fuels. The difference is that the CO2 produced is already part of the carbon cycle - not extracted from the ground specifically for creating aviation fuel. Fossil fuels increase the overall level of CO2 by releasing carbon that had been previously locked away underground. In contrast, SAF recycles the CO2 which is absorbed by the vegetation from which it is made.

According to the International Air Transport Association, IATA, the CO2 absorbed by during the growth of the original plant materials is roughly in balance with the amount produced by using the fuel. This would make SAF carbon neutral, but it must be acknowledged that some emissions are released during the production process, due to transportation and refining methods.

The Good News

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is already accelerating progress towards a net zero future. Not only can it use existing fuel infrastructure in getting to airports, it’s safe to use in current aircraft. SAF can be blended easily with traditional jet fuel and used without modifying the existing engines. Most importantly, simply by using SAF, lifecycle emissions can be reduced by up to 80%.

The IATA estimates that SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions the aviation sector needs to reach its 2050 net zero goals. When you factor in the role aviation plays in film and television productions - not just to transport people to shoot locations but equipment, replacement props and parts, never mind the promotional tours, factoring SAF into your plans will result in significant impact.

Making It Work For You

The inconvenient truth here is that, currently, there isn’t enough SAF to fuel the world’s commercial airlines for even a single day. So, in the spirit of partnership, Air Partner has teamed up with Delta Airlines who has already invested significantly in SAF for their own fleet, and who actively lobby for access to more sustainable, affordable fuels for all. When your travel team books a flight with Air Partner, they’ll be offered the option of purchasing SAF environmental attributes – a super-easy way to claim carbon reductions against the emissions footprint of your own flight. The exact quantity needed is calculated, and the cost added seamlessly onto your flight booking.

This means that your company gives back by being “allocated” the SAF environmental attributes associated with the actual SAF that is loaded into Delta Air Lines infrastructure and used within their network. You have essentially bought the right to “claim” the emissions reduction associated with this physical SAF’s use.

Measuring Your Impact

Evolving legislation means that we all have to prove our impact with verified data. And rightly so to avoid greenwashing. That’s why a SAF Certificate will be issued to you, detailing the specifics of the physical SAF associated with your environmental attributes. It confirms your ownership of these attributes and the emission reductions they represent and can support any related claims you make in that all-important impact reporting.

What About Carbon Offsetting?

This is another option available to you when you book flights with Air Partner. As well as giving back to the planet, you’ll be supporting projects that not only work to reduce CO2 but also to alleviate poverty and improve lives.

Scouting For Eco-Friendly Locations

If you’re thinking about lush settings for your next shoot, consider Costa Rica. Already established as a paradise for eco-tourism, this destination also delivers a massive 90% VAT refund on production budgets over $500K. It also has plenty of eco-friendly production options so, if you’re bringing something adventurous or nature-themed to the screen, Costa Rica’s world-famous rainforests, volcanoes and beaches offer a cost-effective and responsible choice.

(June 25, 2025) — Today, the Michigan Senate passed bipartisan legislation to help launch the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Michigan. Sponsored by Senate Majority Floor Leader Sam Singh (D-East Lansing) and Sen. Joseph Bellino (R-Monroe), Senate Bills 235–36 would establish an income tax credit for the producers and blenders of SAF — a move that would support Michigan’s farmers and economy while reducing the state’s carbon footprint.

“It has been an exciting process to partner with my colleagues across the aisle and across the chamber on this legislation, which not only aims to support Michigan farmers but — in continuing what was outlined in the Clean Energy Future plan — would reduce our reliance on fossil fuels,” said Sen. Singh. “This legislation will open new markets for farmers, helping revitalize rural economies and reinforcing the connection between our agricultural sector and the state’s energy goals.”

SAF is an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel, produced using bio-renewable products like ethanol or diesel, which are manufactured from crops like soybeans or corn. By providing a $1.50 per gallon tax credit for those who purchase, produce, or blend sustainable aviation fuel, this legislation would directly support farmers and the businesses that develop and supply cleaner-burning, ethanol-derived aviation fuels. Additional incentives are available if greater emissions reductions are reached. There is a maximum incentive cap of $4.5 million annually in the first year, and $9 million each year after.

The coalition includes Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR); NATSO, representing travel centers and truck stops; American Trucking Associations (ATA); Illinois Soybean Growers; National Energy & Fuels Institute (NEFI); SIGMA: America's Leading Fuel Marketers; and the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS).

Equalizing the value of the credit between over-the-road biomass-based diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) was an important policy improvement. Creating SAF parity would be an important step to leveling the playing field and mitigating the ongoing problem of SAF displacing gallons of over-the-road biomass-based diesel rather than gallons of petroleum.

Another important policy improvement from the House version was the extension of transferability of the credit to all seven years of the program. Without transferability, most biomass-based diesel producers would not have access to the credit at all.

Finally, biomass-based diesel producers are glad to see that the removal of Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) stayed in the Senate version. After 20 years of predictions of ILUC from biofuels, the modeled ILUC results were never observed and certainly not scientifically agreed upon.

We applaud these policy improvements and call for them to remain in the final version that Congress passes. We especially want to thank Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and biomass-based diesel champion Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), and other members of the Finance Committee for their hard work.

While these improvements make '45Z' a much more workable policy from the original law passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the amendments do not take effect until 2026. The expiration of the blenders' tax credit in January and the lack of implementing regulations for '45Z' have put the biomass-based diesel industry in great peril. The industry is all but shut down for all of 2025 and will continue to be for at least the rest of the year unless there is some transitional short-term policy measure to turn the plants back on and provide a bridge to '45Z' in 2026. We have called for a streamlined version of the blenders' tax credit for the rest of 2025 to be that bridge. Without such a bridge, most biomass-based diesel producers will not survive to 2026. At a time of dangerous conflict in the Persian Gulf, America needs all of the domestic energy it can get.

As global aviation accelerates its shift to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Africa is struggling to keep pace due to prohibitive costs and limited infrastructure. The continent has only five SAF projects and a projected production capacity of just 0.6 million tonnes by 2030.

This leaves Africa sidelined in the industry’s green transition, as SAF currently costs two to three times more than conventional jet fuel—a burden that most African airlines cannot bear without substantial financial support. Jet fuel in Africa averages 17% more expensive than elsewhere, with taxes, fees, and financing costs also significantly higher. Despite these challenges, African air traffic is projected to double to 345 million passengers by 2043; yet, intra-African connectivity remains underdeveloped and dominated by non-African carriers.

Africa World Airlines Announces Fare Reductions and New Route

Africa World Airlines (AWA) will reduce airfares by the end of June 2025, aiming to make air travel more accessible. The airline, known for its strong safety record, also announced the launch of direct flights from Accra to Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, starting July 1, 2025. This new route is expected to enhance trade and partnerships between Ghana and Burkina Faso, offering passengers significant time savings and competitive fares starting at $290.

South African Airways Expands Domestic and Regional Network

South African Airways continues rebuilding its network post-restructuring, with plans to launch and revive several domestic and cross-border routes. The airline will resume flights to George and East London and relaunch the Durban–Cape Town route. Internationally, SAA will commence service between Johannesburg and Gaborone (Botswana) in October and introduce a seasonal route between Cape Town and Mauritius in November 2025. The pace of expansion is contingent upon aircraft availability, as SAA continues to rebuild its fleet following the resumption of operations in 2021.

Recognition for Africa’s Leading Low-Cost Carriers

FlySafair, a South African airline, has been named the Best Low-Cost Airline in Africa for 2025 by Skytrax, praised for its punctuality, efficient check-in, and customizable no-frills model. Other notable budget carriers include Lift and Fastjet, which are expanding regional connectivity. Ethiopian Airlines also retained its title as Best Airline in Africa for the seventh consecutive year, underscoring the strength of the continent’s top full-service carriers.

The aviation industry is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, and as air travel continues to grow, so does its environmental impact. In response, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has implemented the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to mitigate these emissions. A crucial component of CORSIA is the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which has the potential to significantly reduce the industry's carbon footprint. This article provides a comprehensive guide to CORSIA and SAF standards, covering regulations, compliance, and industry impact.

Overview of CORSIA and its Objectives

CORSIA is a global market-based measure aimed at offsetting CO2 emissions from international aviation. Its primary objective is to stabilize emissions at 2020 levels by promoting the use of SAF and offsetting emissions through carbon credits. CORSIA applies to international flights, and its implementation is divided into three phases: pilot (2021-2023), first (2024-2026), and second (2027-2035).

Importance of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuels, made from renewable resources such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and municipal waste. SAF can reduce lifecycle CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. The use of SAF is critical to achieving CORSIA's emissions reduction goals and is considered a key strategy for the aviation industry to reduce its environmental impact.

Brief History and Development of CORSIA and SAF Standards

The development of CORSIA and SAF standards has been a collaborative effort between ICAO, governments, and industry stakeholders. CORSIA was adopted by the ICAO Assembly in 2016, and its standards and recommended practices (SARPs) were developed over the subsequent years. The first batch of CORSIA-eligible SAF pathways was approved in 2020, marking a significant milestone in the development of SAF standards.

CORSIA Regulations and Compliance

Detailed Explanation of CORSIA Regulations

CORSIA regulations require airlines to monitor, report, and verify (MRV) their CO2 emissions from international flights. The regulations also establish a framework for offsetting emissions through the purchase of carbon credits. The CORSIA MRV system is based on three main components:

Emissions monitoring: Airlines must monitor their CO2 emissions using approved methodologies.

Emissions reporting: Airlines must report their emissions to their respective states and to ICAO.

Emissions verification: Emissions reports must be verified by an independent third-party auditor.

The following flowchart illustrates the CORSIA MRV process:

Compliance Requirements for Airlines and Aviation Operators

Airlines and aviation operators must comply with CORSIA regulations by:

Monitoring and reporting their CO2 emissions

Verifying their emissions reports

Offsetting their emissions through the purchase of carbon credits

Maintaining accurate records and submitting reports to their respective states and to ICAO

The compliance requirements for CORSIA are outlined in the following table:

Compliance Requirement Description Emissions Monitoring Monitor CO2 emissions using approved methodologies Emissions Reporting Report emissions to respective states and to ICAO Emissions Verification Verify emissions reports through independent third-party audit Offsetting Emissions Offset emissions through purchase of carbon credits

Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) Processes

The MRV process is critical to ensuring the integrity of CORSIA. The process involves:

Emissions monitoring: Airlines use approved methodologies to monitor their CO2 emissions.

Emissions reporting: Airlines report their emissions to their respective states and to ICAO.

Emissions verification: Emissions reports are verified by an independent third-party auditor.

Production and Supply Chain Considerations for SAF

The production and supply chain for SAF are critical to its adoption. SAF can be produced from a variety of feedstocks, including waste oils, agricultural residues, and municipal waste. The supply chain for SAF must be carefully managed to ensure that it is sustainable and environmentally beneficial.

The following table outlines the key considerations for SAF production and supply chain:

Consideration Description Feedstock Sourcing Ensure feedstocks are sustainably sourced Production Process Optimize production process for efficiency and emissions reduction Supply Chain Management Manage supply chain to ensure sustainability and environmental benefits

Current Challenges and Future Prospects for SAF Adoption

Despite its potential, SAF adoption faces several challenges, including high production costs and limited supply. However, as demand for SAF increases and production technologies improve, costs are expected to decrease, making SAF more competitive with conventional jet fuel.

The future prospects for SAF adoption are promising, with many airlines and aviation operators committing to using SAF. Governments and industry stakeholders are also working together to promote the development and use of SAF.

Industry Impact and Future Directions

Economic and Environmental Impacts of CORSIA and SAF on the Aviation Industry

CORSIA and SAF are expected to have significant economic and environmental impacts on the aviation industry. The use of SAF is expected to reduce the industry's carbon footprint, while CORSIA is expected to promote the development and use of SAF.

The economic impacts of CORSIA and SAF will depend on a variety of factors, including the cost of SAF and the price of carbon credits. However, the adoption of SAF is expected to create new economic opportunities in the aviation industry, including the development of new supply chains and production facilities.

Opportunities for Innovation and Growth in Sustainable Aviation

CORSIA and SAF present opportunities for innovation and growth in sustainable aviation. The development and use of SAF are expected to drive innovation in production technologies and supply chain management.

The following diagram illustrates the opportunities for innovation and growth in sustainable aviation:

Future Directions for CORSIA and SAF Standards

The future directions for CORSIA and SAF standards will be shaped by a variety of factors, including technological advancements, economic considerations, and environmental goals. ICAO will continue to play a critical role in promoting the development and use of SAF and in ensuring the integrity of CORSIA.

As the aviation industry continues to evolve, CORSIA and SAF will remain critical components of its efforts to reduce its environmental impact.

Conclusion

In conclusion, CORSIA and SAF are critical components of the aviation industry's efforts to reduce its environmental impact. The use of SAF is expected to play a key role in achieving CORSIA's emissions reduction goals, and the development and use of SAF are expected to drive innovation and growth in sustainable aviation.

“A lot of global consumption is going to be underpinned by the mandates in Europe and the United Kingdom,” said Fabricio Cardoso, principal at Argus Consulting.

Both of those regions introduced two per cent SAF mandates in 2025 and will be driving global demand going forward, he said during a recent webinar hosted by the company.

Scouting for physiological leaf spot in the coming weeks is critical now that that the crop disease has been confirmed in winter wheat fields in southern Alberta.

Alfonso Berrocal, business development manager for oil products with Argus, estimates that the European Union and U.K. mandates will generate 1.5 to 1.7 million tonnes of demand in 2025.

The EU mandate remains at two per cent for the first five years and then moves to six per cent.

The U.K. mandate is more ambitious in the short-term, growing to 10 per cent by 2030 and 22 per cent by 2040.

However, the EU mandate is bigger in the long-term, climbing to 20 per cent by 2035 and 70 per cent by 2050.

Lindsey Liu, senior Argus analyst covering the Chinese biofuel market, said the Asia Pacific region is a bit behind the EU and U.K., but mandates are coming.

Japan is targeting a 10 per cent SAF mandate by 2030.

Singapore will go to one per cent by 2026, rising to three to five per cent by 2030.

Thailand’s is one per cent by 2026, climbing to three per cent by 2030.

India will have a one per cent SAF mandate on international flights by 2027, rising to five per cent by 2030.

China has no national mandate. Instead, it has set a 50,000 tonne SAF target for 2025 that will be met through airport level blend targets for select airlines at key airports in Beijing, Chengdu, Zhengshou and Ningbo.

Indonesia has a 2.5 per cent target for 2030, while Malaysia and South Korea have one per cent targets.

Australia has no planned mandate, but one is likely coming with the re-election of the Labor government in May.

Liu said there are SAF proposals in most of the major markets in the Asia Pacific region, but there is still considerable policy uncertainty, which is leaving producers wary.

“A lack of firm policy support in most countries in the region is slowing development of the sector and causing timelines of many planned projects to be postponed,” she said.

There are close to 50 announced projects in the region, but many are a long way from producing.

Matthew Cope, American biofuel reporter for Argus, said the SAF supply and demand situation is much further behind in North America.

“This market is far less developed than what we’re seeing in Europe and Asia,” he said.

It is a market that will be driven by tax credits rather than mandates.

Producers are still awaiting clarity on the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit, which will pay up to US$1.75 per gallon for SAF.

Cardoso said when it’s all added up, there will be about 15 billion litres of annual global demand by 2030 and 30 billion litres by 2035.

However, there is a big caveat.

“Obviously, any mandate coming from China could have a massive impact on overall demand,” he said.

As it sits, there will be more global capacity than demand until 2035 when demand finally surpasses capacity.

And that is only using projects that are under construction or have achieved a final investment decision.

If you factor in “very provisional” proposed plants that have not secured financing, the capacity far outstrips demand well beyond 2035.

The burning question for many in the agriculture sector is — what feedstock will be used to make the jet fuel?

“We would expect SAF to be coming primarily from UCO (used cooking oil),” said Cardosa.

However, there won’t be enough UCO to supply the sector by the time the EU achieves its 20 per cent mandate by 2035.

A wide assortment of feedstocks will be needed by that time.",https://static.producer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/25105151/147902_web1_2019-10-20T000000Z_1719650286_MT1NURPHO000INDKSZ_RTRMADP_3_ENGLAND-AIRPORT.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 15:10:26.749165

Brazil's E30, B15 blends to start 1 Aug

Sao Paulo, 25 June (Argus) — Brazilian regulators have approved an increase in ethanol and biodiesel blending into fossil fuels effective 1 August. In a meeting of the mines and energy ministry and national energy policy council CNPE the government decided to move forward with an increase in ethanol blending rates into gasoline to 30pc to make E30, and blend 15pc biodiesel into diesel to create B15. CNPE is evaluating the feasibility of raising ethanol blends to a 22-35pc range and biodiesel blends to a 13-25pc range, mines and energy ministry's biofuels department director Marlon Arraes said during Argus ' Biofuels & Feedstocks Latin America Conference, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The fuel of the future program, introduced to the Congress on September 2023, spurred more than R53bn ($9.6bn) of investments in biodiesel to achieve a 25pc mix by 2026, as well as R24bn invested in ethanol to reach a 35pc blend that same year, Arraes said. Investments in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) through advanced geological techniques reached R140bn, while investments in biomethane and products such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green diesel reached bring that total up to R260bn. Cost competitiveness, feedstock supply risks and regulatory instability remain hurdles to a wider biofuel framework in Brazil, he said. The fuel of the future program avoided 705mn metric tonnes (t) of CO2 equivalent, Arraes said, mostly from CCUS and biodiesel investments. ""We need to engage in our way to produce biofuels and sustainable energy to deliver to society the cheapest decarbonization that we can"", he added.

European middle distillates fall to pre-conflict levels

London, 25 June (Argus) — Gains in European jet fuel and diesel prices caused by the Israel-Iran conflict have entirely reversed following this week's ceasefire agreement. Front-month Ice gasoil futures — the underlying value in Argus ' European middle distillate assessments — sank to $688.25/t at close on Tuesday, 24 June, the day of the ceasefire. This was the contract's lowest settlement since 12 June, the last close before the conflict began. The contract fell by $75/t on the day on Tuesday, the largest single-day decline in 31 months. Benchmark crude basket North Sea Dated dropped by around 11pc to $68.06/bl on Tuesday, its lowest closing value since 11 June. Ice gasoil values rose to $798.50/t on 19 June, as the conflict raised fears of weaker supply from the Mideast Gulf, particularly for middle distillates. The region accounted for just under 25pc of Europe's jet fuel and diesel imports last year, according to Kpler and Vortexa. Tensions rose just as seasonal demand for jet fuel and diesel neared an annual peak in Europe, with the region relying on imports to meet demand. Market participants said the price rises were excessive, considering there had been no disruption to supply. European refining margins have also fallen, reflecting middle distillate prices' heavier falls than those for crude. Delivered cargoes of jet fuel and diesel to northwest Europe held premiums of $21.08/bl and $22.90/bl respectively to Dated, having peaked at $26.82/bl and $28.98/bl on 19 June. Cracks have averaged below $20/bl in recent months. Jet fuel margins could remain elevated in line with seasonal demand, but European diesel supply had tightened before the conflict because of weaker imports and extra demand for marine gasoil (MGO) in the Mediterranean after the start of the emissions control area. This shortness of supply has not yet fully resolved and could further support refining margins in the coming weeks.

Cheaper power key to reach UK’s climate targets

Edinburgh, 24 June (Argus) — The UK's climate plan credibility has improved slightly but no progress has been made to make electricity cheaper, which is key to hit the country's emissions targets, independent advisory body Climate Change Committee (CCC) said in its progress report. The report assesses the UK's progress towards its net zero goals under the current government, which took power in July 2024. The CCC found the UK's 2050 target remains reachable but climate action needs to accelerate, even though policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions have improved. Only half of the 16 key indicators assessed by the CCC, with a relevant benchmark or target, are on track — including offshore and onshore wind operational capacity, sustainable aviation fuel, electric vehicle (EV) charging points and distances travelled by car. EV car sales, heat pump installations, woodland creation and peatland restoration are ""slightly off track"", while the ratio of electricity to gas prices for households and industries is ""significantly off track"", the CCC said. The committee noted no progress has been made on actions to lower the cost of power. The government is planning to consult on this ""in due course"", but CCC urged for actions and timelines. The CCC has identified ""ten priority actions"" for the year ahead, with cutting the cost of electricity for households and businesses again at the top. Cheaper power will support industrial electrification and ""speed up the uptake of clean electric technologies, such as heat pumps and electric vehicles,"" the CCC said. The transition to renewables will eventually reduce the country's reliance on volatile wholesale gas prices, which are the main driver of electricity prices, it said. ""But the government can take immediate action to accelerate this by moving policy costs associated with past schemes, and those that are not directly related to the cost of electricity generation, off electricity bills,"" the CCC said. Removing electricity policy costs — levied on the unit price of electricity at 20 times the rate of gas — would reduce annual electricity bills by £190 ($258) for a typical household with a gas boiler and by £490 for a typical household with a heat pump, CCC found. ""This would bring UK prices into the range of other countries who are ahead on heat pump roll-out,"" it said. The CCC report assessed policy development from July 2024 to 23 May 2025, so does not take into account policies announced in the recent spending review nor the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme intended to reduce electricity costs by up to £40/MWh for more than 7,000 electricity-intensive businesses. UK emissions reached 413.7mn t of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) in 2024, including its share of international aviation and shipping, down by 50pc from 1990 and by 2.5pc from 2023, according to the CCC. The year-on-year reductions come mainly from the electricity supply — declining gas generation — and the industry sector. The government will increasingly need to focus on transport, building, agriculture and aviation to reach its emission reduction targets, the CCC said. The report points to encouraging trends in EVs and in heat pump installations, which grew by 56pc on the year, and in woodland creations, but it reiterated action on these fronts must accelerate. Although much of the progress stems from policies set by previous government, the CCC said ""bold policies"" introduced this year are promising, such as removing planning barriers on renewable deployment and the reinstatement of the 2030 phase-out date for gasoline and diesel vehicles. The market share of new EVs increased on the year in 2024, by nearly 20pc. But CCC noted aviation sector emissions are increasing. The share of sustainable aviation fuel increased to 2.1pc last year from 0.7pc in 2023, but a lot more is required to reach the 10pc SAF mandate by 2030.

Brooke Rogachuk

Rogachuk, who was also selected as an Astronaut Scholar in 2024, became only the second OU student to be selected in back-to-back years. She was also recently named a 2025 Goldwater Scholar. Her undergraduate research has focused on sustainable aviation, and she currently works on sustainable aviation fuel implementation for Boom Supersonic.

“Being an Astronaut Scholar has given me connections that will help me throughout my career. Not only did I get a mentor that helped me land my job at Boom Supersonic, but I’ve made friends with so many people that I can reach out to when I need them,” she said.

She credits the opportunity to conduct her own undergraduate research through the Gallogly College of Engineering as a major reason why she was selected two years in a row.

“A lot of my fellow scholars can’t say that they’ve developed their own methodology or developed their own research study. It’s been really amazing to work in Dr. Dai’s lab and study materials science. It’s something that I don’t think I would have been able to do if I had gone anywhere else but OU,” she said.

by Michael McAdams (Advanced Biofuels Association/Real Clear Energy) Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has moved from the margins of energy policy to the forefront of America’s energy future. Once viewed as a long-shot innovation, SAF is now a commercially viable, rapidly scaling solution to power our aviation sector while revitalizing rural economies and advancing our national goals for energy dominance. As SAF production accelerates, Congress and the Trump administration have an opportunity to cement America’s leadership in aviation fuel innovations by extending long-term tax credits that support domestic SAF production.

This sector’s momentum is undeniable. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently reported that SAF production in the U.S. surged from 2,000 barrels per day at the end of 2024 to 25,000 barrels per day by February 2025. As of May, production capacity stands at roughly 30,000 barrels daily, and industry projections suggest we could approach 500,000 barrels per year by the end of 2025.

SAF’s explosive growth is a direct response to policy certainty and strategic investment—but we are only getting started. I recently spoke with Alison Graab, Executive Director of the SAF Coalition, about this issue. She rightly noted, “The biggest barrier we hear from our coalition members is the need for a longer-term market signal for SAF investment.” Without it, this American success story and the promise it offers to our country’s economy risks being outsourced.

That’s because SAF, at its heart, is an innovation and jobs engine. The entire SAF value chain—from feedstock cultivation to production and refining—offers new economic lifelines to American farmers and rural communities. These fuels are derived from a wide variety of sources, including agricultural residues, waste oils, and even woody biomass. SAF development creates stable demand for these materials, opening new revenue streams for growers and foresters. During our conversation, Graab concurred about the significant potential offered by SAF, “There are so many additional benefits that really offer a lot of opportunities to this administration and Congress.” Put simply, SAF can transform America’s heartland into an energy innovation engine.

Global demand for SAF is projected to soar as countries implement mandates and incentives to power their aviation sectors. As I spoke with Graab, she highlighted how the United States is well-positioned to lead, with more production facilities online than any other nation. “We can see the U.S. continue to grow that by helping to export and fulfill what other countries need in addition to the U.S.,” Graab emphasized. This growth offers America an important energy diplomacy tool and a new source of revenue through SAF exports. At a time when many nations are competing to develop cutting edge energy technologies, America’s ability to scale SAF production is a geopolitical advantage we cannot afford to squander.

Fortunately, Congress is awake to this challenge and has already taken an encouraging step in the right direction. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by the U.S. House of Representatives includes an extension of the 45Z clean fuels production tax credit through December 2031. This is exactly the kind of long-term policy signal investors need to deploy capital into SAF projects. Extending this credit is a critical win, but more must follow. We must ensure the SAF-specific tax credit structure remains robust, technology- and feedstock-neutral, and predictable over the next decade.

To deliver on SAF’s promise, policymakers must act boldly. Long-term certainty around 45Z and related credits is the clearest path forward. Equally important is for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to modernize its regulatory treatment of feedstocks like woody biomass to unlock hundreds of millions of gallons of potential fuels. The American SAF industry knows how to scale. We have the infrastructure, we have the feedstocks, and we have the know-how. Now we need Washington to follow through to unleash this potential to advance our American energy dominance agenda.",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 15:10:31.040011

The Elixir, equipped with a Turbotech turbine, completed its maiden flight in La Rochelle just ahead of the Paris Air Show. This inaugural flight marks a key step toward a 100% SAF-powered flight scheduled for the end of 2025.

To support this initiative, Elixir Aircraft signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)—a formal agreement outlining the intent to collaborate—with TotalEnergies on June 17, 2025. Under this MoU, TotalEnergies will supply part of the sustainable aviation fuel used during flight testing.

First Flight of the Elixir Turbine in La Rochelle

This milestone is part of the BeautHyFuel project, supported by CORAC (the French Civil Aviation Research Council) and the DGAC. It is led by Elixir Aircraft and Turbotech, in partnership with Safran Aircraft Engines, Daher, and Air Liquide.

Following the first engine start on the aircraft in February 2025, the Elixir “Turbine” completed its maiden flight on June 6, 2025, in La Rochelle. The flight lasted 55 minutes. Since then, the aircraft has entered its flight testing campaign, having already accumulated over five hours and seven test flights.

A 100% SAF-powered flight is scheduled before the end of 2025.

The Elixir Turbine is on display at the Paris Air Show as part of a DGAC exhibit showcasing recent innovations from French aerospace manufacturers aimed at decarbonizing light aviation—many of which are already in active operation.

MoU Signed with TotalEnergies

To support its flight testing program using Jet A-1 SAF, Elixir Aircraft signed a Memorandum of Understanding with TotalEnergies on Tuesday, June 17, 2025, during the Paris Air Show. TotalEnergies will supply part of the sustainable fuel needed for the test flights.

The first phase of testing, beginning this summer, will use a 35% blend of SAF biofuel produced in France by TotalEnergies. A second phase will use 100% SAF by the end of 2025.

“TotalEnergies shares our ambition to develop solutions that help decarbonize the aviation industry. We are thrilled to conduct the Elixir Turbine tests with the support of this leading innovator in aviation fueling,” said Arthur Léopold-Léger, Co-founder and President of Elixir Aircraft.

“We are delighted to support Elixir Aircraft with the supply of sustainable aviation fuel for its flight tests. SAF plays an essential role in decarbonising the aviation sector and this agreement demonstrates our ability to support our customers in reducing their CO₂ emissions,” said Louise Tricoire, SVP Aviation & Marine Fuel at TotalEnergies.

The Elixir: A 4th Generation Aircraft, Made in France

The Elixir is a 4th-generation aircraft featuring a streamlined all-composite Carbon OneShot airframe, composed of only nine parts—no rivets, no glue. This innovative technology offers exceptional structural integrity, enhanced safety, simplified maintenance, and a lighter weight—resulting in lower fuel consumption compared to traditional 2nd-generation metal or 3rd-generation semi-composite aircraft. Thanks to its advanced structure and low fuel usage of just 12 litres per hour, the Elixir is the most environmentally efficient aircraft in its category.

With an order book of 300 units—mostly for export—the Elixir has been adopted by private flight schools such as Airbus Flight Academy and Leading Edge Aviation, and was recently selected by ENAC (École Nationale de l’Aviation Civile).

A Future-Proof, Fuel-Agnostic Aircraft

While Elixir Aircraft chose the reliable Rotax engine to meet today’s flight school requirements, the company remains focused on advancing sustainable aviation technologies:

Its current production of ultra-efficient piston-engine aircraft, running on unleaded fuel, already reduces CO₂ emissions by 70%.

The development of the Turbotech TP-R90 turbine prototype, designed to run on sustainable aviation fuel, will achieve an 85% reduction in CO₂ emissions.

With stronger measures, the UK can not only achieve its legally binding climate targets but also boost energy security for homes and businesses nationwide.
Without tougher policy and real investment in sustainable fuels, airport expansions and weak carbon pricing will put climate targets and industry leadership at real risk.
The government should take urgent action to tackle non-CO2 emissions as highlighted in the report and start properly charging for international aviation emissions.
The report highlights that in shipping recent IMO decisions on fuel standards and emissions pricing have improved shipping’s outlook for meeting climate targets.","The Climate Change Committee (CCC) has today published its first assessment of the new Labour Government’s progress on reducing emissions. The independent statutory body reports that, while government policies have improved over the past year, further urgent action is still required. With stronger measures, the UK can not only achieve its legally binding climate targets but also boost energy security for homes and businesses nationwide.

Anna Krajinska, UK Director T&E said, ‘The UK’s transport sector is at a crossroads. To keep net-zero targets within reach, we need immediate action: maintain the ZEV mandate, set a clear path to phase out diesel HGVs, and accelerate investment in sustainable aviation fuels. This must be coupled with comprehensive pricing for fossil fuel use in shipping and aviation to drive forward the switch to clean alternatives.Now is the time for bold policy, not more flexibilities or delays’

For cars, with flexibilities on the rise, CCC reports that the ZEV mandate risks shifting from ‘slightly off track’ to ‘significantly off track’—if carmakers exploit flexibilities. T&E’s analysis shows that the recent changes risk a cliff edge in 2030 with carmakers potentially having to sell an impossible over 100% ZEV to make up for excessive borrowing. To reduce this risk the government must ensure regulatory certainty and a robust industrial strategy to support domestic manufacturing and stay competitive.

T&E UK is also calling for urgent government action to complement new infrastructure investment. While the confirmation of 54 new zero-emission HGV charging hubs by Innovate UK is a positive step, the UK Government has still not established a clear regulatory mandate to drive the uptake of zero-emission heavy goods vehicles, and ensure the phase-out of diesel HGVs by 2040. Without a robust policy mechanism—such as a ZEV-HGV mandate—the UK risks falling short of its net-zero transport targets, leaving industry and investors without the certainty needed to accelerate the transition to cleaner freight

In aviation, according to the CCC, emissions now outpace the UK’s entire electricity sector. Without tougher policy and real investment in sustainable fuels, airport expansions and weak carbon pricing will put climate targets and industry leadership at real risk. The government should take urgent action to tackle non-CO2 emissions as highlighted in the report and start properly charging for international aviation emissions.

The report highlights that in shipping recent IMO decisions on fuel standards and emissions pricing have improved shipping’s outlook for meeting climate targets. However, T&E’s analysis shows that the IMO regulation only covers 20% of UK emissions and further action by the UK government is needed to meet climate targets. This should include the expansion of the UK Emission Trading Scheme to include international shipping.",https://www.transportenvironment.org/uploads/images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/pexels-alexeydemidov-10658552.jpg?mtime=1750840764,N,,2025-06-25 16:08:04.678515

SAF value lowered in Senate proposal While the House bill does not explicitly mention SAF, the Senate proposal suggests lowering the maximum value of the credit for SAF from $1.75 per gallon to $1.
The 45Z credit was intended to build off those developments and support options that would reduce carbon intensity.
“Today what matters is carbon intensity and innovation,” Fitzgerald said of the 45Z credit value model.
Under the Senate proposal, ethanol producers can claim the 45Z credit for themselves rather than selling their fuel to an alcohol-to-jet SAF producer, which could undermine growth, Cooper explained.","Treatment of sustainable aviation fuel under the 45Z tax credit for clean fuel producers in the Senate GOP budget reconciliation could be detrimental for the domestic market, sources say.

Both the House-passed reconciliation bill, and the proposal by the Senate Finance Committee would preserve 45Z and extend it through 2031, a win for many across the biofuel spectrum. But key differences between the two proposals could have a major impact on the SAF space.

Senators hope to vote on the final reconciliation bill and return it to the House later this week. Until then, senators are debating key provisions of reconciliation, including 45Z and SAF.

The clean fuel production credit is one of the few Inflation Reduction Act credits preserved in this reconciliation. Credits like those to support electric vehicles, clean electricity and clean hydrogen production were cut or will be phased out.

Upon returning from meetings at the White House Monday night, some senators reported that President Donald Trump wanted the entirety of the IRA cut. However, the 45Z credit has significant support from Republicans representing the agriculture sector.

Leaving a GOP conference Monday night, Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said the Senate Finance Committee's 45Z provision was still under discussion. Leaders indicated in the meeting that they plan to continue the path of the draft released last week. But Moran noted there’s no final text.

Ahead of the final text, SAF and farm groups are pushing the Senate to adjust pieces of the 45Z provision.

In a letter obtained by Agri-Pulse, 37 farm groups urged Senate Finance members to move toward the House proposal for disincentivizing foreign feedstocks instead of the Senate proposed model.

Under the House reconciliation bill, the credit could only apply to fuels made with feedstocks from the U.S., Canada or Mexico. The Senate version would cut the value of the credit by 20% if the fuel uses feedstocks grown outside the U.S., which farm groups worry is less effective in making domestic feedstocks competitive.

SAF value lowered in Senate proposal

While the House bill does not explicitly mention SAF, the Senate proposal suggests lowering the maximum value of the credit for SAF from $1.75 per gallon to $1. This puts it on the same level as other road fuels like ethanol and renewable diesel.

This cut would be a challenge for the SAF industry given it’s an opt-in fuel under the Renewable Fuel Standard and Low Carbon Fuel Standard programs, Tom Miller, who leads biofuels regulatory affairs for energy giant BP, said on a webinar. This means SAF is starting at a disadvantage in comparison to road fuels. The increased credit value under 45Z was an important incentive for SAF project development.

Renewable diesel production and SAF production have similar economics. However, Bruce Fleming, CEO of Montana Renewables, said that without a premium, producers are less compelled to produce SAF.

“People won't bear the working capital cost. People won't bear the transportation costs and the headaches absent a premium,” Fleming said. “That can come from policy support, that can come from the market, that can come from early adopters, that can come from countries with mandates.”

Unlike road fuels, SAF producers have to build new infrastructure in the U.S., said Lindsay Fitzgerald, chief advocacy and communications officer at Gevo.

Fitzgerald said the biodiesel blenders tax credit was effective at getting many road fuels on a level playing field by supporting the development of blending infrastructure. The 45Z credit was intended to build off those developments and support options that would reduce carbon intensity.

“Today what matters is carbon intensity and innovation,” Fitzgerald said of the 45Z credit value model. “That’s what this program is rewarding.”

If the Senate proposal isn't changed, Fitzgerald said some refineries could convert to renewable diesel. But without the added incentive, the SAF market is likely to stall. This lowered credit could specifically hinder ethanol to jet facilities, Fitzgerald said.

Lower credit could slow industry growth

SAF is one space in which the ethanol and corn industry see some promise, particularly given consumer demand and the push for sustainability across the globe. But it’s going to take time for the industry, particularly the ethanol-to-jet sector, to scale up, said Matt Ziegler, biofuel policy lead for the National Corn Growers Association.

“Knocking down the value of that credit by 75 cents is certainly detrimental in our eyes,"" he said.

Shortly after the Senate text was released, Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs for Clean Fuels Alliance America, said he could see the credit reduction becoming an impediment to making the fuel competitive or potentially slowing further investment.

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, echoed concerns about the reduction in the value for SAF under the Senate proposal. He said the original structuring of 45Z presented challenges for alcohol-to-jet production, but cutting the credit will make that even harder.

Under the Senate proposal, ethanol producers can claim the 45Z credit for themselves rather than selling their fuel to an alcohol-to-jet SAF producer, which could undermine growth, Cooper explained.

“If Congress envisioned 45Z helping to drive growth in sustainable aviation fuel and really open the door for alcohol-to-jet made from corn ethanol, we’re not sure that limiting 45Z to $1 for SAF is going to accomplish that goal,” Cooper said.

The SAF industry backs some features, including extension through 2031. The sector has long called for a longer runway for the credit to provide market certainty and encourage investment. This extension is likely to provide that, particularly for independent developers, Miller said.

The Senate version does not phase out transferability for the credit. The House version does. Preserving transferability does add cost but is a win for both renewable road fuels and SAF.

“We have to have it,” said Fleming of Montana Renewables of transferability. “Nobody’s going to operate without it.”

Before the IRA, it was not possible to sell and buy credits. Instead, a producer could allocate credits to an investor through partnership allocation rules. But this was a complex and burdensome process, said Sue Moon, an associate at King and Spalding. Even though the transferability rules are still complex, it was quickly adopted by many producers.",https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/California-Bureau/sustainable-aviation-fuel-836x627.jpg?height=635&t=1749433164&width=1200,N,,2025-06-25 09:02:51.539372

Derived from waste like used cooking oil, SAF offers an 80% reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions. Global policies, innovative feedstocks, and airline commitments are driving its adoption, aiming to reshape aviation’s role in the climate crisis.

SAF, particularly those derived from used cooking oil, avoids the ethical and ecological concerns associated with food-based biofuels. Unlike palm or soy oils, UCO-based SAF supports a circular economy by repurposing waste, reducing landfill use, and easing pressure on natural ecosystems. Countries like Malaysia are leveraging their waste streams to become key suppliers of feedstock to major SAF producers in Europe.

Government mandates and airline sustainability pledges are accelerating SAF integration. In 2025, both the UK and EU will require a minimum of 2% SAF blending in jet fuel, with targets rising gradually. Airlines under large international groups are already sourcing SAF with green certifications, demonstrating how regulatory support and market demand can catalyse environmental innovation at scale.

Despite its promise, SAF production remains costly and limited in scale. Current supply cannot yet meet global demand, and price competitiveness with fossil jet fuel remains a hurdle. However, aviation experts say SAF could account for 65% of the emissions cuts needed to hit net-zero targets by 2050. Investments, subsidies, and public-private collaborations are key to boosting its availability.

Experts stress that the aviation industry alone cannot green its future—governments, fuel producers, airlines, and consumers must align. From incentivising UCO collection to expanding certified supply chains, sustainable aviation demands a systems-level approach. With growing interest from regions like Asia and support from global climate organisations, SAF is fast becoming the standard bearer for decarbonised air travel.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel represents more than a cleaner fuel alternative—it’s a symbol of how innovation, responsibility, and collaboration can reshape entire industries. With countries repurposing waste, airlines embracing green procurement, and global standards tightening, SAF is poised to play a pivotal role in climate-resilient aviation. As adoption expands, used cooking oil could become the unlikely hero of our journey to net-zero skies.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is an umbrella term for all aviation fuels that are produced without the use of fossil fuels like petroleum, which have an up to 80 % lower carbon footprint. For electricity-based power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels, the CO₂ reduction compared to fossil fuel-based kerosene will be even higher in the future (> 90 %). SAFs are blended with conventional fossil kerosene for use in aviation.

And why is it important?

Alternative fuels are the only way to decarbonize aviation with existing technology. Condor will purchase SAF over the next 12 months as part of “Round up for the future” in quantities that exceed the legally prescribed amounts. This amount of SAF will be used on future Condor flights. Moreover, according to the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can help reduce contrails and climate impacts in air travel.

Because SAF contains fewer aromatic compounds than kerosene, it results in fewer soot particles. This reduces the formation of ice crystals and thus the development of cirrus clouds, which contribute to global warming. Moreover, SAF could positively impact other non-CO₂ emissions like nitrogen oxides and continue to alleviate the pressure on the climate.

How can you support us in using SAF in the future?

Your contribution makes a difference – when refueling on future Condor flights. We specifically use the rounded-up amount from the “Round up for the future” initiative to purchase and use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The funds are allocated exclusively to SAF fuel. Book now, round up, and together we will make a big difference, little by little!

Partnership with Caphenia for power-based sustainable fuels

Condor and start-up Caphenia have engaged into a long-term partnership on the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). In doing so, we are supporting the further development of the process to market-readiness, while ensuring access to firmly agreed purchase quantities once production has reached an industrial scale. (expected to be in 2027).

Caphenia aims to generate a synthesis gas from bio-methane, CO₂, water, and renewable energy to produce environmentally friendly fuels. According to Caphenia, CO₂ emissions can be reduced by up to 92 % compared to the fossil fuel kerosene.

Caphenia's first production facility is currently being built at the Höchst Industrial Park in Frankfurt to demonstrate the industrial scalability of the technology. It is expected to start producing SAF on an industrial scale from 2027, at which point the purchase agreement with Condor will also take effect.

Associated partner of the innovation platform InnoFuels

​​This project is coordinated by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and runs from February 2023 to August 2026. The goal of the InnoFuels platform is to speed up the industrial production of electricity-based fuels (power-to-liquid, or PtL) and advanced biofuels in Germany. This will be achieved by connecting stakeholders from science, industry, politics, and society to leverage synergies and advance the development and application of these fuels.

The project is divided into seven thematic innovation priorities, which encompass all process steps – from raw material procurement through production to the application of fuels. In these areas, research institutions, companies, and political actors collaborate to develop practical solutions. We are also involved in the steering committee for the aviation sector.

Collaboration with INERATEC

The first commercial-scale INERATEC plant is located in Frankfurt, designed to produce up to 2,500 tons of sustainable e-fuels and e-waxes annually. Located in an industrial park, the plant uses renewable hydrogen and biogenic CO₂ to produce synthetic hydrocarbons that are then processed into drop-in fuels, waxes, and chemicals. These products are compatible with existing infrastructure and will meet the legal requirements for sustainable fuels in various industries, including aviation, shipping, and chemicals.

The INERATEC Customer Advisory Board (CAB) is an exclusive, invitation-only forum for leading representatives of airlines, aircraft manufacturers, airports, and policymakers who are shaping the future of more sustainable aviation. Condor has been involved in CAB since spring 2025.

By providing insights into market trends, production requirements, and regulatory challenges, members help INERATEC scale its e-SAF technology to advance industry-wide decarbonization efforts.

The move signals a pivotal shift in the airline’s approach to decarbonization and comes at a time when global aviation is under mounting pressure to accelerate climate action.

Unveiled at the airline’s Pride Centre in Nairobi, the report places SAF at the heart of Kenya Airways’ long-term environmental strategy. Through a memorandum of understanding with a local fuel producer, the airline plans to cultivate SAF feedstock on degraded land in Kwale County, previously a mining site. The initiative is expected to generate homegrown SAF for both domestic use and export markets, reducing emissions while strengthening energy security.

The development comes as fuel continues to dominate the airline’s carbon footprint, accounting for over 60% of total emissions. By anchoring SAF production within its operations, Kenya Airways aims to address both climate impact and long-term fuel cost volatility. According to CEO Allan Kilavuka, localizing SAF supply could enhance not only environmental sustainability but also economic resilience.

The airline has already made early strides. In 2023, Kenya Airways became the first African airline to operate a long-haul flight using SAF, flying from Nairobi to Amsterdam. It has also taken steps to green its ground operations, converting 12 service vehicles to electric and launching a waste-to-biodiesel pilot plant.

Beyond SAF, the 2024 report outlines broader progress in embedding sustainability across Kenya Airways’ operations. In the past year, the airline served over 5.2 million passengers, expanded its workforce by 8%, and increased the proportion of women employees to 44%. A 15% reduction in operational waste was recorded, and 12% of ground service equipment is now powered by renewable energy. In the same year, the CEO said they set up a plant to convert waste plastic into biodiesel, which is a lot cleaner than fossil diesel.

The company’s afforestation programme also remains a flagship climate action initiative. To date, over 1.2 million trees have been planted, with plans to replicate this scale annually. Meanwhile, women now represent 8% of KQ’s pilot workforce, nearly double the global average – reflecting targeted efforts to close gender gaps in aviation leadership.

Kenya Airways’ environmental strategy is aligned with the global “Fly Net Zero by 2050” commitment under the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The airline is also a participant in the SkyTeam alliance’s Sustainable Flight Challenge, which encourages innovation in low emission flying through competitive benchmarking and shared best practices.

The sustainability report was welcomed by government officials, who praised KQ’s contributions to national climate goals. Kenya has committed to a 32% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The airline’s SAF initiative, alongside fleet modernization and waste reduction was hailed as a strong example of public-private cooperation for low-carbon development.

Kenya Airways’ leadership in SAF comes as other African carriers begin to explore similar solutions. In South Africa, SAA is examining SAF production from sugarcane and biomass feedstocks. Ethiopian Airlines has piloted SAF on select flights, while Morocco and Egypt are evaluating industrial capacity to support alternative fuel scaling. These efforts reflect a growing recognition that Africa’s aviation future must align with global climate expectations, even though the continent currently accounts for just 2–3% of global aviation emissions.

Significant hurdles still remain; Globally, SAF supply meets only about 2% of demand, and production costs remain four to five times higher than traditional jet fuel. For many African carriers, already contending with high operating costs and currency instability, SAF adoption without supportive policy frameworks or financial incentives is a steep climb.

Momentum, however, is building. The African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC) has endorsed the continent’s participation in CORSIA—the UN-led Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. Countries like Rwanda and Nigeria have initiated national aviation decarbonization roadmaps, while regional airports are assessing green retrofit opportunities and carbon-neutral certification.

The dream of a cleaner, more sustainable aviation sector is fast becoming a reality with the growing adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—particularly those derived from used cooking oil (UCO). SAF represents a crucial innovation in the global effort to reduce the aviation industry’s environmental impact.

SAF is a biofuel that can be blended with conventional jet fuel, offering a significantly lower carbon footprint without requiring any major modifications to aircraft engines or airport infrastructure. Depending on the feedstock and production method, SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel.

Recognizing aviation’s contribution to global emissions—2.5% of the world’s energy-related CO₂ emissions in 2023—the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and national governments are pushing for broader SAF adoption. The European Union and the UK, for instance, have begun requiring that jet fuel contains at least 2% SAF starting in 2025, with that number set to rise gradually over the next 15 years.

One of the most promising feedstocks for SAF is waste oil, especially UCO. When compared to biofuels made from agricultural commodities like soy or palm oil, UCO-based SAF avoids competition with food crops and helps prevent deforestation, making it a truly circular and responsible solution.

Countries like Malaysia, one of the world’s largest producers of UCO and virgin palm oil, are playing a key role in this green transition. A recent initiative there rewards volunteers with up to $21 per litre for turning in used cooking oil. Companies like Evergreen Oil & Feed, which operates UCO collection centers, are supplying this crucial feedstock to European SAF producers such as Spain’s Repsol, UK-based Shell, and Finland’s Neste.

Major airline groups like the International Airlines Group (IAG)—parent company of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus, and LEVEL—are already purchasing SAF with green certification from jet fuel suppliers, signaling a strong commitment to low-carbon aviation.

Despite its potential, SAF still faces hurdles: primarily in terms of production scale and cost. However, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF is expected to contribute to 65% of emissions reductions needed for the aviation sector to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

The journey toward greener air travel has taken off—and with collective action from governments, industries, and individuals, SAF could be the fuel that powers a cleaner future for aviation.",https://indianpsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/British-Airway.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 07:04:43.124115

Abstract

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a key component for the defossilization of the aviation sector. The economic feasibility of SAF production is typically evaluated through techno-economic assessments (TEA), with the Minimum Jet Fuel Selling Price (MJSP) serving as the key economic performance indicator. Comparing MJSP values across different SAF pathways is challenging and potentially misleading due to differences in modelling assumptions, estimation methods for key variables, and their underlying relationships. This study aims to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the economic feasibility of four prominent SAF pathways: Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Pyrolysis-to-Jet (PTJ), Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), and Fischer-Tropsch (FT). We employed qualitative and quantitative methods, including meta-analysis and variable harmonization, to analyze a wide range of TEA studies from the literature and investigate the factors contributing to MJSP variation for these pathways. Our findings reveal that feedstock cost is a primary driver of MJSP variability across all pathways. Moreover, regression and harmonization analyses uncovered complex interdependencies among economic variables often underexplored in individual TEAs. Key sources of MJSP variability include methodological differences in by-product credit valuation, process design choices, capital cost estimation approaches, and financial assumptions. Recognizing and addressing these factors offers strategic opportunities to improve the techno-economic performance and comparability of SAF pathways. Notably, the PTJ pathway emerged as a promising alternative for non-food feedstocks, and all pathways demonstrated improved economic outcomes when integrated with existing industrial infrastructure. The analytical findings of this study provide a robust empirical foundation that can be leveraged by future studies aimed at policy analysis, as well as for project budgeting and investment decisions in sustainable aviation fuels.

The national carrier shared the update during the launch of its 2024 Sustainability Report at the Pride Centre in Nairobi, reports The Standard.

KQ CEO Allan Kilavuka said the airline has signed a memorandum of understanding with a local SAF producer. The project will involve planting trees on degraded land in Kwale County, a former mining site, to generate feedstock for SAF production. “Our goal is to produce SAF for both local use and export once the trees mature around 2030,” he said.

Kilavuka noted that KQ has already planted 1.2 million trees and plans to match that number annually. He highlighted that fuel accounts for 64% of the airline’s carbon emissions, stressing the urgency of adopting cleaner alternatives. “SAF is still new and costly—about four to five times more expensive than regular jet fuel—which makes its adoption challenging,” he said.

He added that 30–35% of airline costs come from fuel, making fuel efficiency a priority. KQ is working with the African Airlines Association to improve flight routes and reduce distances flown.

In May 2023, KQ became the first African airline to use SAF for a long-haul flight, flying from Nairobi’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport.

KQ has also converted 12 pieces of ground service equipment to electric and established a plant that transforms plastic waste into biodiesel. Kilavuka said the airline is committed to promoting gender equality, with women making up 8% of its pilots—well above the global average of 4–5%.

Principal Secretary for Environment and Climate Change Festus Ng’eno praised KQ’s role in helping Kenya reach its target of a 32% reduction in CO₂ emissions by 2030. “This SAF project is a perfect example of the public-private partnerships needed to drive green growth,” said Ng’eno, in remarks delivered by John Elungata, Secretary of Administration at the State Department.

Aviation’s path to sustainability is being redefined, not just by innovations in fuel chemistry, but by how those innovations are being deployed. A recent strategic move by Houston-based company XCF Global illustrates how the future of clean aviation fuel may depend as much on flexibility and partnership as on the fuel itself.

The company has unveiled a bold international expansion strategy centered around a modular facility design and local licensing partnerships. While this may seem like just another corporate expansion, its implications for global sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) deployment deserve closer attention.

From Centralized Innovation to Distributed Impact

XCF Global’s announcement highlights a transition from centralized SAF development to localized empowerment. By offering regional partners access to its synthetic aviation fuel platform through licensing agreements—while retaining intellectual property ownership—XCF is adopting a capital-light model that fosters scale without sacrificing control.

This isn’t just smart economics. It’s a strategic acknowledgment of a complex reality: local regulations, feedstock availability, logistics infrastructure, and policy support vary widely across markets. A modular and locally adapted approach enables faster uptake in regions otherwise sidelined by traditional fuel infrastructure models.

Local Partnerships as Catalysts for Global Progress

The company’s emphasis on “smart, localized partnerships” echoes a wider trend in sustainable transport: empowering local actors to lead while leveraging global technology. Rather than simply exporting facilities or fuel, XCF’s strategy invites co-ownership of the decarbonization journey. This approach unlocks regional momentum and may become a defining characteristic of successful SAF deployment worldwide.

The licensing-plus-equity model also allows the company to remain invested—both financially and operationally—in each market’s success. This represents a subtle shift from the historical norm of corporate detachment, toward a shared-responsibility ecosystem in clean aviation.

Signals from the Market and Beyond

What adds weight to XCF’s move is timing. Governments around the world are moving to reduce aviation-related carbon emissions. From Europe’s blending mandates to North America’s clean fuel incentives, the demand for scalable, certified SAF is escalating.

Yet, the road from innovation to implementation is often blocked not by science, but by distribution bottlenecks. XCF’s patent-pending modular design could prove to be the bridge between feasibility and real-world adoption. Modular facilities can adapt to different feedstocks, regulatory contexts, and infrastructure limitations, giving regions autonomy to advance their own decarbonization timelines.

Building Trust Through Transparency and Stability

Another often overlooked aspect of this development is financial health. XCF reports a conservative debt profile with a total debt to capital ratio of just 0.01. In an industry where capital expenditures can be daunting, financial discipline enhances credibility—especially when entering emerging or less predictable markets.

Moreover, the company’s stable capital structure and newly secured $50 million equity line underscore its readiness to support long-term, sustainable growth. Recent executive appointments and a board with deep experience in energy transition issues further support this trajectory.

The Bigger Picture: A Global Transition Requires Local Solutions

For sustainability professionals, XCF’s expansion strategy offers a case study in harmonizing innovation, economics, and policy. It demonstrates how SAF technologies—though global in ambition—require regional customization.

The aviation sector, responsible for nearly three percent of global carbon emissions, has few alternatives to liquid fuel in the short term. As such, synthetic aviation fuels that are both scalable and certifiable hold promise. But only if their deployment mechanisms are as innovative as their chemistry.

Why This Matters Now

With XCF’s Nasdaq listing and renewed leadership structure, the company seems poised to act not just as a fuel supplier, but as an architect of the next-generation SAF ecosystem. The conversion of its Nevada facility to support renewable diesel and SAF production is more than a logistical shift; it is a signal of intent to serve as a modular model for others to follow.

In a world where sustainable solutions often falter in the leap from laboratory to large-scale impact, this distributed model could serve as a critical blueprint for others in the low-carbon mobility space.

Conclusion: Turning Strategic Design into Shared Climate Action

This isn’t just a story about fuel or expansion. It is about unlocking local potential through globally informed design. XCF Global’s approach highlights how progress in clean aviation will come not only from what is produced, but how it is shared and where it is implemented.

Sustainability professionals should take note. The future may belong to those who see modularity not as a technical workaround, but as a philosophical commitment—to flexibility, partnership, and regional ownership of global climate goals.

By drawing attention to such approaches, industry voices can foster deeper alignment between technology, policy, and local action. The modular mindset may well be the bridge that links today’s innovations to tomorrow’s net-zero skies.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-47.svg,N,,2025-06-25 08:02:54.136653

The traditional idea of energy dominance has long revolved around fossil fuel extraction and global supply control. Today, however, a quiet yet powerful shift is underway. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is becoming one of the most dynamic instruments in reshaping the American energy agenda. This transition is not simply about replacing one type of fuel with another. It is about building a resilient energy economy grounded in domestic innovation, rural revitalization, and global leadership in clean technologies.

Recent policy discussions and data from national agencies show that Sustainable Aviation Fuel is more than a decarbonization tool—it is emerging as a catalyst for strategic advantage.

From Niche to Necessary: A Steep Climb in Production Capacity

Just a year ago, Sustainable Aviation Fuel was largely considered an emerging technology. Today, it has surged into the mainstream of US energy policy. According to the US Energy Information Administration, SAF production has grown from just 2,000 barrels per day at the end of 2024 to over 30,000 barrels daily by mid-2025. This trajectory is expected to continue, with projections pointing toward 500,000 barrels per year by the end of the year.

This momentum reveals more than market dynamics. It reflects the power of aligned policy, strategic incentives, and industry readiness. Crucially, it signals that clean fuels are no longer on the periphery of American energy systems—they are central to them.

Innovation Rooted in Rural America

The story of Sustainable Aviation Fuel is as much about rural revitalization as it is about decarbonization. From agricultural residues to woody biomass and waste oils, the raw inputs for SAF come from the very communities often overlooked in clean energy narratives. These are not fringe sources. They are economically viable, scalable, and capable of fueling both aircraft and livelihoods.

Alison Graab of the SAF Coalition underscored this point in a recent interview, highlighting how SAF can become a long-term engine for economic stability in rural regions. These communities are positioned not just as beneficiaries but as central actors in the next era of American energy growth.

Global Demand Creates Domestic Opportunity

The SAF market is not limited to US borders. International demand is rising rapidly as governments implement mandates and incentives to green their aviation sectors. With more operational SAF production facilities than any other country, the United States has a head start—but this advantage must be nurtured.

SAF offers the US a rare convergence of environmental, economic, and diplomatic opportunity. Scaling production supports domestic sustainability goals while also serving global markets. This is not merely about exporting fuel—it is about exporting standards, systems, and scalable solutions that can help other nations meet their climate commitments.

Policy Certainty: The Foundation of Long-Term Investment

Despite its upward trajectory, the SAF industry still faces hurdles—chief among them, policy uncertainty. Investors, project developers, and supply chain stakeholders all need a consistent framework to commit long-term capital.

The extension of the 45Z clean fuels production tax credit through December 2031, recently passed in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by the House of Representatives, is a major step in the right direction. This credit provides essential assurance that public policy will continue to reward innovation and production in this space.

Yet this is only a beginning. The industry also needs clarity and predictability around feedstock eligibility, regulatory standards, and credit valuation. Specifically, the modernization of regulations surrounding woody biomass by the US Environmental Protection Agency could unlock vast additional capacity.

A Moment to Lead, Not to Pause

The current phase of SAF expansion is less about technological feasibility and more about execution. America has the talent, infrastructure, and feedstocks to meet soaring demand. What is needed now is a firm commitment from policymakers to create the enabling conditions for exponential growth.

This is a rare alignment: a clean technology with bipartisan potential, strong job creation prospects, rural appeal, and significant export value. SAF is not asking for special treatment—it is asking for a consistent, forward-looking framework that acknowledges its role in America’s strategic interests.

The Subtler Advantage: Redefining Energy Power Through Systems Thinking

One of the most compelling yet underdiscussed aspects of the SAF revolution is its role in redefining what energy leadership actually looks like. It shifts the focus from raw extraction to circular systems, from global control to local empowerment, and from fossil-based exports to sustainable innovation flows.

This systems-level approach resonates with transport and sustainability professionals worldwide. It offers a blueprint for how mobility, energy, and environment goals can be aligned not just in rhetoric, but in infrastructure and investment.

Conclusion: Building the Bridge Between Policy, Industry, and Purpose

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is no longer a hopeful experiment. It is a proven pathway toward economic diversification, climate resilience, and global leadership. As Congress considers long-term tax incentives and regulatory refinements, the opportunity is clear: support this momentum and secure America’s place at the forefront of aviation’s clean energy future.

For those working in mobility transformation and sustainability, the evolution of SAF provides a clear case for integrated strategy. It is a sector where policy clarity, regional collaboration, and technological deployment must work hand-in-hand. It also reveals the growing importance of consulting, advisory, and implementation partners in bridging ambition with action.

The Trough of Disillusionment

The Gartner Hype Cycle tracks the five key phases of a technology’s life cycle. Following the ‘Technology Trigger’ with significant media interest and the ‘Peak of Inflated Expectations’ which sees scores of failures, the sector moves into the ‘Trough of Disillusionment’ where interest wanes. Later, following investment in promising ideas, the industry reaches the ‘Slope of Enlightenment’ and the ‘Plateau of Productivity.’ (Wayne J Davis/RAeS)

The Gartner Hype Cycle might have its detractors, but its memorable descriptors often resonate as we follow the progress of technologies towards commercial success.

Aviation sustainability, while not a technology as such, has certainly followed a familiar path in recent years and, therefore, when Mark Westwood, Professor of Aeronautics at Cranfield University, says he thinks we are heading into Gartner’s ‘Trough of Disillusionment’, it is not hard to see what is driving that view.

Westwood is, however, keen to emphasise that he does not actually feel disillusioned. “It’s a part of the technology development life cycle,” he explains, “what you see playing out is the enthusiasm of engineers and scientists hitting the cold, hard facts of physics and economics.”

As the aviation industry started to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, there was an acceleration of interest in developing new technologies and strategies to enable the sector to meet net zero 2050. More radical technologies, such as hydrogen-fuelled aircraft enabling true zero emissions flight, buoyed by government investment, went from being principally hypothetical case studies happening in academia to industry-led research programmes firmly focused on practical implementation.

Projects developing hydrogen-fuelled propulsion technologies over the last few years have ranged from start-ups and small companies focused on powertrains initially suitable for retrofit into existing small aircraft to the Airbus ZEROe programme with the ambition to develop new airliners. However, since their inception around 2020, many of these projects have struck headwinds – Universal Hydrogen shut down in 2024 after failing to find adequate funding and Project Fresson and ZeroAvia have both seen delays to planned key milestones.

Hydrogen hold-ups

Is future flight powered by hydrogen? (Lufthansa Technik)

A further blow to the industry’s hydrogen ambitions came in February this year, when Airbus announced that its previous plan to launch a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft in 2035 would be pushed back by five to ten years. Airbus’ announcement also drew attention to the required infrastructure and ecosystem required to support hydrogen aircraft, which is possibly a bigger challenge than the aircraft technology itself, and is not wholly within the aerospace sector’s control.

Nonetheless, Duncan McCourt, CEO of Sustainable Aviation, believes that hydrogen will play a significant role in aviation. “It’s probably been pushed a little bit to the right,” he explains, “but I would expect it to play a part to 2050 and to expand significantly beyond then.”

The harsh realities of these delays to the introduction of hydrogen aircraft, particularly those of a larger size, is that the technology is likely to offer only a minimal contribution towards net zero before 2050.

In commercial aviation, regional and smaller aircraft account for less than 10% of emissions, with the rest coming from single-aisle and widebody aircraft. However, based on recent news, hydrogen-fuelled versions of these larger aircraft do not seem likely to come into service at all before 2050. Of the small proportion of emissions which might be addressed by first-generation regional hydrogen aircraft before 2050, it will only be feasible to address a fraction of them due to the slow timeline of fleet replacement in aviation.

According to Cirium data, in 2024, only 34% of the global fleet was comprised of the latest generation of aircraft (Airbus A320neo family, A350, Boeing 737 MAX and 787). These aircraft first came into service between 2011 and 2017, yet still represent only just over a third of the fleet, clearly demonstrating the limited impact that yet-to-be-developed new hydrogen aircraft could have before 2050. Furthermore, the environmental benefit of resolving supply chain issues and accelerating deliveries of current state-of-the-art aircraft, which are typically 10-20% more efficient than the aircraft they replace, should not be underestimated.

The SAF dilemma

SAF has the potential to provide a fast route to decarbonisation but its production at scale has problems, regardless of the source of the fuel. (ATR)

Thankfully, decarbonising aviation is not solely reliant on radical new aircraft technologies and the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a major contributor to reaching net zero for the sector in all potential roadmaps. SAF certainly has the potential to provide a faster route to decarbonisation than anything that relies on the introduction of new aircraft, given that it can be used in the existing fleet, albeit as a blend or with some additives to make it a drop-in fuel.

However, although SAF is an effective means of reducing emissions from aviation, its production at scale seems to give rise to controversy, regardless of the source of the fuel. For Tony Henley, Chair of the RAeS Environmental Sustainability Co-ordination Group, considering SAF derived from waste, the challenge is the availability of the feedstock in sufficient quantities. “Waste-derived SAF will give you a few percent of what you need, but it isn’t going to solve the problem,” he explains, adding that a lot of waste is currently used elsewhere in other industries and diverting it to aviation will serve only to transfer the problem to different sectors.

When it comes to plant-based SAF, “you’re either taking agricultural land which is already in short supply (and climate change is making it scarcer still)… so you’re immediately threatening people’s food supplies. If you don’t use agricultural land…then you’re turning vast uncultivated areas into monocultures, so you’re massively denting biodiversity”. Henley also flags the cost and effort of using this marginal land which is typically unused due to the difficulty of cultivation.

This leaves Power-to-Liquid SAF, where captured carbon is combined with green hydrogen to form synthetic kerosene. On paper it has the potential to reduce the net emissions more than the other options but, as Henley explains, “the only problem is that you need a massive amount of energy to get those raw materials and then combine them into a usable fuel.” He continues: “That’s got to be the way to go … but unless we massively increase the amount of green electricity, it’s not viable.”

However, despite these challenges, McCourt is optimistic about the ability of industry to scale up SAF production, “where there’s a will and a commercial interest to do so.”

The need for green energy

Despite flying a demonstrator aircraft, Universal Hydrogen failed to find adequate funding and closed in 2024. (Universal Hydrogen)

It is notable that both Henley and Westwood, when asked what they see as the biggest barriers to reaching net zero 2050 for aviation, identify the reliance on cheap renewable energy as a significant risk. Increasing the supply of green energy is not something which falls within the purview of the aerospace sector and will be heavily reliant on government policy if it is to be achieved. In recent months, however, UK politicians across the parties have seemingly been pulling back from the commitment to reaching net zero by 2050. Although it currently remains government policy, it does not seem inconceivable that the current policy may be diluted or delayed. This will have knock-on impacts on all the industries reliant on developments such as renewable energy or greenhouse gas removals and require national and global coordination and support. It is also yet to be determined how the recent US move away from climate action might affect global efforts to address the issue. Furthermore, Westwood suggests that the current geopolitical landscape is likely to drive increased defence spending in many countries, putting pressure on budgets, potentially at the cost of spending on environmental initiatives.

There is also the growing realisation that net zero is an expensive objective, not least for aviation, and one that consumers seem reluctant to pay for. Recent research by the RAeS into public attitudes to decarbonisation (see ‘Would you pay more to decarbonise your flight?’ AEROSPACE April 2025) suggested only a little over a third of passengers might be willing to pay more for a greener flight and, as Westwood says, “It’s very difficult to see how alternatives to kerosene will be cheaper.”

With the aerospace sector seeming unlikely to branch out into renewable energy generation (except perhaps on a small scale at airports to support ground operations), SAF petrochemical processes or greenhouse gas removal technology, their role in the development and scale-up of these out-of-sector enablers for aviation net zero seems best suited to that of an intelligent customer – clearly articulating the demand, opportunities and implications but not acting directly.

Ever more efficient

Recent cuts to NASA’s budget have contributed to Boeing’s decision to pause work on the joint Transonic Truss-Braced Wing demonstrator project. (NASA)

Where then should industry be focusing its internal efforts? Accepting that the best fuel is the fuel you do not use, should we be concentrating on developing the next generation of conventional aircraft, pursuing further efficiency improvements for SAF-fuelled aircraft to lighten the demand on renewable energy for SAF production?

Westwood thinks this is an important element of industry’s drive towards net zero: “I’d like to see both of those companies [Airbus and Boeing] focusing really heavily on what’s the absolute best we could do with the technologies we’ve got. Maybe it flies slightly slower, it’s lighter, it’s got even better aerodynamic performance or optimised structures – what’s the best that we could possibly do if these high-risk technologies don’t come off?”

Research from the UK’s Aerospace Technology Institute suggests that the next generation of single-aisle and widebody aircraft, using only relatively mature technology improvements could see a 15-20% reduction in fuel burn, compared to current aircraft.

It certainly seems as though the technology exists for a new highly efficient aircraft, which could contribute significantly to net zero, even if the idea does not generate the levels of hype and enthusiasm that new fuels and radical aircraft designs do. Furthermore, both aircraft and engine OEMs are working on more ambitious developments, such as extremely high-aspect ratio wings and open rotor engine configurations. However, the recent announcement of a draft budget for NASA which eliminates all “green aviation” programmes must be bad news for Boeing, which has already paused work on its X-66 Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project.

However, neither Airbus nor Boeing seem particularly inclined to launch new aircraft development programmes imminently. Indications a few years ago were that they might target a new single-aisle aircraft entering service in the mid-2030s with a larger aircraft following later but, as previously explored, waiting that long will mean the impact before 2050 is much reduced due to the slow rate of fleet replacement, which is unlikely to change due to the economics for airlines.

It is economics, or rather the business case, which seems to be lacking in terms of encouraging the airframers to act sooner. At the end of 2024, Airbus had an order backlog of 8,658 aircraft, while Boeing’s backlog stood at 5,595. Having such a solid order book with their existing production aircraft, the investment required to develop a new aircraft and the inherent risk associated with it, must seem both unnecessary and unappealing, even if it might bring environmental benefits. “I think we’re being naïve if we think they’re going to have environmental sustainability as their primary focus,” says Westwood. “I have no doubt both organisations are well-intentioned but they’ve got businesses to run.”

Is net zero by 2050 achievable?

The future of airline flight? (Airbus)

With delays to radical new technologies, the replacement of the fleet with more efficient conventional aircraft seeming likely to take decades and SAF and greenhouse gas removals reliant on uncertain global government action, is 2050 an achievable timeline for reaching net zero for the sector? Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, certainly seems not to think so, having recently stated that he believes the industry will need to review its targets.

“My view would be that we should not focus on 2050,” says Westwood. “It’s just a line in the sand. The best solution [for aviation] might not be the one that gives you the most reduction in emissions at the 2050 point.”

McCourt, however, favours continuing to target net zero 2050 and believes it is an achievable goal. “The balance of various technologies that deliver net zero will probably change beyond 2050, but I still think it’s right that we have a target.”

Henley has a similar perspective: “Net zero in 2050 might not be possible, but getting a lot closer to net zero by 2050 than we are at the moment is worth having.”

Despite challenges, there seems to be no hesitation over the importance of pushing towards net zero, even if the target of 2050 is in question. However, with the challenges and uncertainties that exist, and which are becoming more apparent, it does not seem too much of a stretch to say that we are indeed on the downward slope to the Trough of Disillusionment – both in relation to the novel technologies that remain a key component to emission-free flight but also for aviation sustainability as a whole.

Catchy labels aside, as Westwood says: “You can convince yourself it is all impossible, but it doesn’t really mean we should divert from what we’re doing. The drivers, the reasons for doing it, haven’t gone away. It’s just recognising that it is more difficult, but the direction [we are moving in] is the right direction.”",https://www.aerosociety.com/media/26872/zeroe-demonstrator.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 07:05:06.177985

US President Donald J. Trump swept into office on a mission to throttle back activity in the nation’s booming renewable energy industries, but the hits just keep on coming. The latest development involves the massive new Project Roadrunner e-fuels facility in Reeves County, Texas, near Pecos. The developer, US-based Infinium, aims to replace conventional jet fuel with a new concoction formulated from green hydrogen and captured carbon.

Follow The Money To E-Fuels

If you’re wondering why Texas is a good location for an SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) operation, that’s a good question. After all, Texas is a longstanding epicenter of US oil and gas production. However, Texas has also become a leading wind and solar producer in the US, and thus a suitable environment for green hydrogen producers. Unlike conventional hydrogen extracted from natural gas, green hydrogen is jolted loose from water in electrolysis systems powered by renewable energy.

With its copious footprint in various industrial operations, Texas also produces a large amount of capture-able carbon, along with the infrastructure needed to transport fuels from one place to another. As described by its developer, the US firm Infinium, Project Roadrunner will deploy captured emissions from local operations that currently vent CO2 to the air. The renewable energy will come from purpose-built wind and solar farms in West Texas.

CleanTechnica has been following the e-fuels project since 2023, when American Airlines and the Breakthrough Energy Catalyst Fund got involved. Last year, Brookfield Asset Management put up $200 million to claim the role of strategic funding partner for the project, along with another $850 million earmarked for distributing e-fuels including sustainable aviation fuel from Project Roadrunner.

In the latest development, on June 24, the leading global financial firm HSBC provided additional, substantial support in the form of a project-based credit arrangement. “The financing marks a significant step forward for the Roadrunner Project, which will produce approximately 23,000 tonnes per year (7.6 million gallons) of synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other low-carbon eFuel products using renewable electricity and captured carbon dioxide,” Infinium explained in a press statement.

What’s In It For HSBC?

So … interesting! While US financial institutions and other leading corporate citizens have busied themselves currying favor with the malevolently incompetent Commander-in-Chief who occupies the White House, HSBC is a UK-based firm that follows a different drummer to the beat of global decarbonization. The firm is determined to deepen its mark on the US market, which explains its interest in a high-profile e-fuels project.

HSBC doubled down on its US footprint last year, highlighted by the unveiling of a new headquarters in New York City’s super-trendy Hudson Yards district in Midtown Manhattan.

“Our new U.S. headquarters in the heart of one of the world’s financial capitals symbolizes our commitment to our clients and to this critical market,” enthused HSBC Group Chairman Mark Tucker in a press release celebrating the new HQ dated May 23, 2024.

“We remain focused on connecting our clients in the US to opportunities overseas, and those around the world to the US,” HSBC emphasized.

Apparently, the abrupt shift in federal energy policy since May of 2024 has not deterred HSBC from its decarbonization mission. Referring to the newly announced credit arrangement in support of Project Roadrunner, HSBC’s CEO for Infrastructure Finance and Sustainability Danny Alexander explained that the transaction “represents HSBC’s commitment to support emerging decarbonisation technology, crucial to accelerating the transition.”

“The construction of Roadrunner is a first-of-a-kind facility and marks a huge achievement for Infinium and for the fuel industry,” Alexander added.

E-Fuels Really Are Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

With its green hydrogen connection and American Airlines among the offtakers already in its pocket, Project Roadrunner validates the opinion of analysts at BloombergNEF. At a recent energy conference in New York City, BNEF opined that green hydrogen is not ready for prime time yet, except in optimal market conditions such as those offered by Texas.

For the record, Project Roadrunner is Infinium’s second e-fuels venture in Texas, following the commissioning of its Project Pathfinder facility in 2024.

California is another state determined to have a hand in the US e-fuels industry. In March, the Texas-based firm HIF Global announced that it has earned Tier II Design Pathway Certification for its e-fuels process from the California Air Resource Board, through the agency’s Low Carbon Fuels Standard division.

“This LCFS certification underscores the growing demand for e-Fuels in the U.S. and globally, which could reach more than 250 mtpa by 20351, providing opportunity for over $1 trillion in potential capital investment in new facilities to produce the fuels, including HIF Global’s 1.4 mtpa e-Fuels project,” noted HIF Global Board Executive Director Meg Gentle.

Somewhat ironically, that particular project is not located in California. The site is Matagorda County, Texas. Even more ironically, when HIF Global announced Matagorda as the location for its first e-fuels project in the US, Texas Governor Gregg Abbot enthusiastically endorsed the idea.

“With plans to make a $6 billion capital investment, HIF will create more than 125 permanent operating jobs as well as thousands of other direct and indirect jobs in the region,” the Office of the Governor noted in a press release dated April 18, 2022.

Abbott and his fellow Republican elected officials in Texas are not particularly known for their affection for renewable energy, but money talks and Abbott added his two cents to the celebration.

“As the leader in the future of eFuels, HIF will be an excellent addition to the Texas economic juggernaut,” Abbott cheered. “This investment is great news for Texans in Matagorda County and the Coastal Bend, with more jobs, opportunity, and enhanced technology coming to the Lone Star State.”

Next Steps For E-Fuels In The US

Meanwhile, not to splash cold water on the Matagorda project — but they did anyways — on May 29 BBC News reported that the final investment decision has yet to be nailed down. The company is “waiting to see what the Republican-led Congress does to clean energy tax credits, in particular the one for clean hydrogen production,” observed BBC reporter Zoe Corbyn.

If the Republicans make the tax credits for green hydrogen go buh-bye, perhaps HIF can dial up HSBC for a loan. Better yet, perhaps e-fuels cheerleader Abbott can prod the Republican members of the Texas delegation to Congress for some relief. After all, he’s the one who said that “Texas is proud to be the energy capital of the world, and I look forward to a continued partnership with HIF to keep our state the energy leader.”

There were some positives and negatives for Canada’s canola industry, said the executive director of the Canadian Oilseed Processors Association.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released its proposed rule for the Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume obligations (RVOs).

The biomass-based diesel mandate, which includes biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, was set at 5.61 billion gallons for 2026 and 5.86 billion gallons for 2027.

That is a massive increase from the 3.35 billion gallon mandate for 2025 and is even higher than the 5.25 billion gallons that a coalition of oil and biofuel groups had been lobbying for.

That is good news for Canada’s crushers and canola farmers.

The bad news is that the EPA also proposed that foreign biofuels and feedstocks would only generate 50 per cent of the Renewable Identification Numbers (RIN) credit value relative to U.S. biofuels and feedstocks.

“That’s unfortunate,” said Vervaet.

“They’re proposing a 50 per cent haircut, if you will.”

The American Soybean Association was thrilled with the “new concept.”

“As soybean farmers struggle to maintain biofuel feedstock market share amid the rapidly growing flood of cheap, foreign feedstocks like used cooking oil, this proposal would once again give U.S. agriculture a competitive edge in the biofuel value chain,” the association said in a press release.

Vervaet is puzzled that the EPA chose to penalize Canadian canola-based biofuels since elsewhere in the proposed rule it praised canola oil as a predictable and plentiful feedstock.

He said that new proposal could seriously restrict the flow of Canadian canola oil to the U.S. market.

“With that type of a haircut on credit values, we’re going to be challenged to compete with other feedstocks. There’s no doubt about it,” he said.

However, he is hopeful that the EPA will come to its senses in time for the final rule, which is expected later this year.

“We have to remember this is a proposed rule. There is still time to influence some of the final content in this rule,” he said.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee released its draft of the One Big Beautiful Bill, which includes an extension of the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit.

Vervaet said there were some pluses and minuses with that legislative proposal as well.

He was pleased to see that the credit, which pays up to US$1 per gallon for biodiesel and renewable diesel and $1.75 per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel, would be extended through the end of 2031, just like the House version of the bill.

More importantly, both the Senate and House reconciliation bills exclude indirect land use change (ILUC) from being used to calculate lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. That means canola-based fuels would be eligible for the credit.

However, the Senate version of the bill differs from the House version in one crucial area.

The House version limits the availability of the 45Z credit to fuels produced from feedstocks grown in the U.S., Mexico or Canada.

The Senate version says the feedstock can be produced anywhere, but the credit would be reduced by 20 per cent for fuel produced from feedstocks grown outside the U.S. effective Jan. 1, 2026.

Vervaet said the Senate version penalizes Canadian canola oil, while the House version creates a “ringfence” for North American feedstock, which he thinks makes sense.

“Our markets are so integrated already, where you have millions of dollars of feedstock and finished fuels crisscrossing our border,” he said.

He is hopeful that the House will prevail in that aspect of the ongoing budget bill battle.

Ian Thomson, past president of Advanced Biofuels Canada, said the glass is definitely half empty when it comes to how Canada’s biofuel producers view the new U.S. policy proposals.

“We’re worse off than we were before,” he said.

The biomass-based diesel industry was “delighted” with the EPA’s new mandates for 2026 and 2027.

But Canadian biofuels would not be competitive in the U.S. market if they can’t get the same RIN values and tax credits as American biofuels.

Thomson is pleased with the removal of the ILUC factor in calculating greenhouse gas emissions, but it is a hollow victory because soybean oil renewable diesel would receive a $0.53 per gallon credit under the new rules, while canola oil renewable diesel would get a $0.22 credit.

“You’re still way under water versus the U.S.,” he said.

Thomson said U.S. biofuel policy is shifting to a made-in-the-U.S. approach, rather than the open border concept that existed for years.

Canada may have to follow their lead and promote made-in-Canada biofuels, he said.

Ottawa is aware of the problem and is well briefed on what needs to happen to keep Canada’s biofuel sector whole.

“They understand there is urgency,” said Thomson.

“This is not something that can grind through iterations of how Canada will respond.”

British Columbia recently made changes to its Low Carbon Fuels Act, doubling the renewable fuel mandate for diesel to eight per cent and requiring that the renewable content must be produced in Canada.

“Could Canada do likewise?” said Thomson.

“It could.”",https://ukragroconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/biotoplivo.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 00:58:57.305693

Netherlands publishes RED III biofuels draft

London, 24 June (Argus) — The Dutch government's updated draft legislation to transpose the EU's revised Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) notably proposes abolishing double-counting renewable energy contributions from Annex IX feedstocks. The draft introduces a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction mandate for land, inland shipping and maritime shipping, but excludes aviation — which was included in a previous draft . The RED III mandate will take effect in 2026. Obligated parties have to fulfil the mandate by surrendering a sufficient amount of so-called emission reduction units (EREs) in each sector. The mandate's flexible credit allowance allows EREs generated in the land sector to be used to partly meet emission reduction obligations in inland and maritime shipping ( see table ), but EREs from inland and maritime shipping cannot be used by land sector suppliers to fulfil their compliance requirements. Fuel suppliers with overall consumption of more than 500,000 l/yr will need to incorporate a 14.4pc share of renewable fuels in their annual deliveries in 2026. This increases linearly, to reach 27.1pc in 2030. The amount of crop-based biofuels in the land sector will be limited to 1.4pc of the overall energy content of total consumption until 2030, and will not be accepted towards targets in maritime and inland shipping and aviation. The amount of Annex IX Part B biofuels — such as used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats categories 1 and 2 — that can be counted towards the mandate will be limited to 4.29pc in the land sector and 11.07pc in inland shipping. Obligated parties will be unable to claim EREs from Annex IX Part B fuels used in maritime shipping. The draft also introduces a minimum share of emission reductions that have to be achieved by Annex IX Part A and renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO), for all sectors. RED III mandates that 5.5pc of all fuels supplied must be advanced biofuels, including at least 1pc RFNBOs by 2030. The Netherlands' draft decouples these targets, to reduce investment uncertainty ( see table ). Refineries that use renewable hydrogen in their production process can claim refinery reduction units — or RAREs — which can be used by a supplier to meet an RFNBO sub-target in various sectors. Correction factor delay The ministry will delay its plans to apply a ""correction factor"" of 0.4 to its ""refinery route"" stimulus for hydrogen demand, in order to ensure the measure does not undermine direct use of hydrogen in transport. The correction factor means the value of emissions reductions credits generated through the use of renewable hydrogen for transport fuel production would be limited to a certain percentage of those generated through direct use of renewable hydrogen or derivatives in transport. The government leaves the option open to impose a correction factor from 2030. Although the EU Fuel Quality Directive increases the maximum share of bio-based components to 10pc in diesel, the Dutch government said fuel suppliers must continue to offer B7 — diesel with up to 7pc biodiesel — as a protection grade, because of the large number of cars incompatible with B10. Companies will be able to carry forward any excess EREs to the next compliance year. Companies with an annual obligation can carry forward up to 10pc of the total amount of EREs needed to fulfil their obligation in a year, with registering companies allowed to carry forward 4pc. Dutch renewable fuel tickets (HBEs) carried into 2026 will be converted into EREs on 1 April 2026, the government said.

Erex to start Vietnam biomass co-firing tests in August

Tokyo, 24 June (Argus) — Japanese renewable energy developer Erex plans to start coal and biomass co-firing test runs at thermal power plants in Vietnam from August. Co-firing test runs will start at the 110MW Na Duong plant in August and at the 115MW Cao Ngan plant in September, Erex said on 20 June. Both plants are owned and operated by Vietnam National Coal and Mineral Industries (Vinacomin). The Japanese company announced in April that it was planning co-firing test runs at the two plants , but had not previously disclosed when the tests would start. The trial operations are expected to last for several months and burn locally produced wood chips, starting from 5pc co-firing and gradually increasing to 20pc. The two companies will renovate the plants in 2026-27 after the trial operations and start commercial co-firing operations around 2027-28, Erex said. Erex said it also plans to conduct co-firing test runs at Vinacomin's 670MW Cam Pha plant in 2027-28 and start commercial operations around 2029-30. The company aims to carry out co-firing at six Vinacomin plants with a combined capacity of 1,585MW, including Na Duong, Cao Ngan, and Cam Pha. The co-firing projects are part of Vietnam's net zero strategy. Erex is eyeing carbon credits from the plants once commercial co-firing begins. The company aims to sell some of the carbon credits in Japan and is currently negotiating with Vietnamese government on this. Erex is expanding its renewable energy business in Vietnam and southeast Asia. In addition to co-firing projects, the company aims to operate a total of 19 biomass-fired power plants in Vietnam. The first of these, the 20MW Hau Giang plant, started commercial operations in April. Erex also plans to build up to five biomass-fired power plants in Cambodia. The company projects that profits from Vietnam and Cambodia will account for more than half of its overall earnings by around 2030, from nearly negligible levels in 2024.

Ontario weighs domestic biomass-based diesel quota

New York, 23 June (Argus) — Ontario is considering requiring that domestically produced renewable fuels make up 3pc of the province's diesel pool, an effort to help biodiesel producers struggling to adapt to policy changes in the US. Ontario late last week requested input on a proposal to supplement existing provincial biofuel blend requirements with a new mandate for Canadian production, similar to a domestic content rule that took force in British Columbia this year. Ontario already requires that renewables like biodiesel and renewable diesel make up 4pc of diesel consumption each year, but this proposal would require that three-fourths of that mandated volume come from biofuels produced in Canada. The Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks says the proposal is in response to a new clean fuel tax credit that took effect in the US this year, which can only be claimed by US producers. A US Department of Agriculture report late last year said that there were six remaining operational biodiesel plants in Canada and that the industry has historically sent almost all its fuel into the US, which up until this year treated foreign biodiesel as eligible for a federal tax credit. At the same time, US biofuels have increasingly entered Canada to meet demand from low-carbon fuel standards federally and in British Columbia. In those programs, higher-carbon fuels that exceed annual carbon intensity limits incur deficits that suppliers must offset with credits generated from approved lower-carbon alternatives. The Canadian biofuel industry has pushed officials to respond. British Columbia as a result began requiring this year that renewables make up a minimum 8pc of diesel fuels supplied in the province, up from 4pc, and that this mandated volume must come from Canadian producers starting in April. British Columbia-based renewable diesel producer Tidewater Renewables has also unsuccessfully pushed Canada to impose duties on US product. The Ontario environment ministry said the domestic mandate, if finalized, would be a ""temporary, time-limited measure"" that would last as long as US subsidies ""threaten Ontario's biodiesel industry."" The new US tax credit that excludes foreign refiners is currently set to lapse after 2027, but Republican lawmakers have floated using a massive budget bill they want to pass in the coming weeks to extend the incentive through 2031. While full regulatory text is not available, as is typical for this early stage of the Ontario rulemaking process, it appears the proposal would otherwise keep intact the general structure of the province's biofuel mandate. The program offers more credit to lower-carbon fuels, which led to a slightly lower than 4pc biofuel blend rate for the diesel pool in 2023, according to a report from trade group Advanced Biofuels Canada. The domestic content proposal would also not affect a separate mandate that biofuels make up increasing amounts of the gasoline pool through 2030.

Commercial aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise. Airlines burn fossil fuels at high altitudes with few viable alternatives. The result is over 1.1 billion tonnes of CO₂ emissions per year, a figure projected to rise with global demand. The goal is to reach net zero by 2050.

But what if nature already offered us the solution? Here’s how how hemp can eliminate aviation emissions.

The hemp advantage

Hemp is a fast-growing industrial crop that captures CO₂ from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Its long fibres and woody stalks can be used in construction, biofuels and bioplastics.

Tao Climate focuses on two climate applications of hemp:

Carbon removal

When processed into building materials like hempcrete, the carbon captured by hemp during growth is locked away for decades. Each tonne of hemp can remove around 1.6 tonnes of CO₂ from the atmosphere.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Hemp biomass can be fermented into ethanol and refined into drop-in SAF through the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) process. SAF made this way can cut lifecycle emissions by 75 percent compared to fossil jet fuel.

Our model to reach net zero aviation by 2050

We modelled the land and biomass scale-up required for hemp to deliver aviation decarbonisation on a planetary scale. In this scenario, global hemp biomass increases from 300,000 tonnes in 2020 to around 3.9 billion tonnes by 2050. Each year, 20 percent of the biomass is permanently sequestered in infrastructure, while 80 percent is processed into SAF.

Only the correct carbon benefits are counted:

CO₂ removed into hemp used for SAF is not counted, as that carbon is re-emitted in combustion.

CO₂ avoided by SAF is counted, based on lifecycle emissions savings.

CO₂ removed into hempcrete or other long-term use is counted, as that carbon stays locked away.

What the chart shows

This chart illustrates how the total climate impact grows over time, split between CO₂ removal via permanent storage and avoided emissions via SAF. By 2050, the combined impact meets or exceeds 1.1 gigatonnes per year, neutralising aviation’s carbon footprint.

Land area required

At full scale, this model would require about 650 million tonnes of hemp biomass per year stored and 2.6 billion tonnes processed into SAF. Assuming average yields of 6 tonnes per hectare, this translates to approximately 650 million hectares under hemp cultivation globally. While ambitious, this represents less than 5 percent of global agricultural land and is achievable through international cooperation, innovation and the use of marginal lands.

Tao Climate is building this future now

Our AI-powered monitoring platform ensures scientific accuracy and full transparency in how carbon is measured, reported and verified. Our credits support hemp housing reconstruction in Ukraine and our SAF pathway delivers verified emissions reduction potential for the aviation industry.

Contributed by Adam Klauber

Government policy can be instrumental in advancing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), especially when market forces alone are slow to drive adoption. SAF, which can significantly reduce aviation emissions, currently accounts for only about 0.3% of global jet fuel. Cost, feedstock availability, and infrastructure timelines are major barriers to demand and supply. Many governments around the world are stepping in with policies to accelerate SAF production and adoption.

These SAF policies reflect different governmental systems and priorities. Comparing them can help producers, developers, and investors make decisions for the near term and try to influence future government actions. This chart summarizes some key SAF policies around the world. You’ll find more details below, with some of the most interesting aspects of these policies highlighted.

United Kingdom: Mandates + Revenue Certainty

For a small country, the United Kingdom has a very strong policy, combining incentives — in the form of high credits for carbon reduction — with mandates for SAF reaching 10% of forecasted jet fuel consumption by 2030. This is an ambitious target, given that the UK’s current SAF supply is near zero. The timeline aligns with the time needed to build SAF plants, hopefully encouraging rapid project development.

The UK is especially interesting because it is also developing a revenue certainty model. If airlines can’t afford SAF due to market conditions, the government can provide financial support to cover the price premium. Having a government backstop to cover the price premium of SAF is unique to the UK right now.

The UK is also trying to support new SAF feedstock technologies such as electrofuels by scaling down the percentage of HEFA SAF (the most mature SAF production pathway today) that can be used to meet mandates. The HEFA process can account for 100% of SAF through 2026, after which the allowed share progressively drops to 71% in 2030 and 35% in 2040. Regardless of production pathway, SAF must meet a 40% carbon reduction threshold compared to fossil jet fuel to qualify under the mandate.

More on UK SAF policy can be found here.

European Union: Blending Mandate + Subsidies

The ReFuelEU blending mandate obligates fuel suppliers to blend increasing amounts of SAF into jet fuel. It started modestly at 2% in 2025 but rises to 34% by 2040 and ultimately 70% by 2050. The EU uses percentage-based blending targets tied to actual fuel usage, which demands detailed data calculations that may make it harder to implement.

Eligible SAF must meet a wide set of feedstock and emissions reduction requirements set out in the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). EU SAF must achieve emissions reductions of at least 65% compared to fossil fuel, with carbon intensity values to decrease over time.

The EU recently announced a subsidy program to help airlines afford SAF. They can receive subsidies of up to €6 per liter for electrofuels and €0.5 per liter for biofuels. In addition to offering higher subsidies, EU policy aims to advance newer technologies like electrofuels and alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuel with a specific prohibition on recognizing imports of HEFA. But the EU needs to rely on outside supply to reach its targets due to the realities of how much feedstock can be grown or obtained from the region, so the policy may have to allow for Book & Claim contracts to satisfy requirements.

More on EU SAF policy can be found here.

United States: Incentives

The United States bears extra attention due to its status as a leading supplier of SAF and its unique policy profile. Rather than using mandates, the United States relies on tax incentives and voluntary programs to stimulate domestic production of SAF. Although specifics are currently in flux, the 45Z producers tax credit now in place offers up to $1.75 per gallon for SAF, depending on feedstock emissions profiles.

In the United States and elsewhere, Scope 3 customers — typically corporations seeking to reduce Scope 3 aviation emissions — are increasingly entering the SAF market, helping to cover costs and drive demand and investment. With SAF certificate insets, these companies can buy the environmental attributes of SAF and apply them against their aviation emissions, while the fuel itself goes into the supply chain. The Book & Claim chain-of-custody model tracks these transactions and ensures integrity.

Although US policy uncertainty is a challenge at the moment, it’s important to recognize the existing federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) has no expiration. In fact, recent EPA proposals have better aligned RFS obligations and targets with real-world production capacity. That’s a strong signal to producers that some form of market-sensitive government incentive will exist over the duration of their investment. SAF must deliver at least 50% life-cycle GHG reductions to qualify.

Several states also offer SAF incentives. California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) is opt-in and voluntary, rewarding low-carbon fuel production with tax credits without mandating the use of specific fuels. States like Washington, Oregon, New Mexico, Illinois, and Iowa have also introduced SAF-specific tax benefits.

The US incentive model can avoid economic distortions that sometimes accompany mandates, when the penalty for noncompliance can easily become the price of the product, regardless of what it costs to produce. This can stifle demand and put producers out of business.

In an incentive market, risk comes in times of volatility or high prices, when it can be difficult for customers or producers to manage the costs. But overall, the price of incentive-driven SAF is closer to the real cost of producing it, which is more efficient for buyers.

More on US SAF policy can be found here.

Brazil: Emissions-Based Targets + Book & Claim

Brazil’s Fuel of the Future policy takes a pragmatic approach to aviation decarbonization. First, it focuses on GHG reductions, not SAF volume. Airlines must reduce domestic aviation emissions by 3% by 2030 and 10% by 2037 based on a full life-cycle analysis. This approach incentivizes the use of technologies or feedstocks with lower carbon intensities and the continual improvement of SAF over time.

Second, Brazil is the only country explicitly allowing Book & Claim for SAF. Airlines may be able to meet emissions targets by purchasing SAF attributes tied to fuel used elsewhere. For some period of time, that may be the way they can comply because there isn’t yet commercial SAF supply in Brazil.

More on Brazil SAF policy can be found here.

India: Mandate

India targets 1% SAF on international flights by 2027, rising to 2% in 2028, with domestic SAF targets expected later. It’s one of the few developing countries with such a policy. India is attracting considerable interest from investors, especially in the alcohol-to-jet and ethanol conversion technologies, which can be supported by an array of local feedstocks, including bamboo and sugarcane. Some SAF production plants are in the pilot or ramp-up stage, including ethanol producer Praj and state-controlled refiner IOC, which has projected 1% SAF production on its own by fall 2025.

However, it’s not yet clear whether the domestic demand from airlines and corporations will be sufficient to cover the price premium. This challenge may lead some SAF producers to sell their physical supply to more developed markets, where there is a higher willingness to pay.

Japan: Preparing for a 2030 Mandate

Japan mandates that refiners replace 10% of fossil jet fuel with SAF by 2030. Though the mandate is not yet in force, preparations to comply are underway. Government subsidies of up to ¥30 per liter ($0.78 per gallon) are available for producers and are already being awarded. Some airlines are signing offtake agreements. And one refinery began delivering SAF domestically in early 2025, although its production volumes are unclear.

More on Japan SAF policy can be found here.

Singapore: Mandate + Passenger Fee

Beginning in 2026, flights departing Singapore must use 1% SAF, ramping to 3%–5% by 2030. The mandate will be supported by a centralized SAF procurement system and a levy on ticket prices, shifting the cost burden from fuel producers to passengers. The levy varies by target volumes of SAF, its cost, and the distance and class of travel.

The policy is intriguing because it allows for the influence of market forces. Money collected from the levy will purchase fuel at competitive prices, which avoids market distortions and shields airlines.

One short-term issue in Asia is limited regional demand, given the delayed mandate timeframe. For example, Singapore currently exports SAF to the UK. A global Book & Claim system could allow SAF certificates to fulfill international mandates without physically transporting fuel — minimizing emissions and costs.

Conclusion: The Need for Long-Term Policy Certainty

Government policies worldwide are providing material support and signaling confidence in future SAF development. This article is by no means an exhaustive list, and additional SAF policies are continually coming into play. But regardless of where SAF programs are enacted, the question of policy certainty stands out.

Giving private investors and entrepreneurs confidence that government frameworks that exist today will exist well into the future is probably the number one way to unlock new supply. Financial institutions ignore short-term policy for capital investment decisions and weigh permanent measures like the US Renewal Fuel Standard most favorably when determining policy risk and commercial viability.

Policy stability, ideally aligned with investment timelines, is a key goal for the SAF industry and its supporters to pursue in the interest of decarbonizing aviation while meeting the enduring demand for flight.",https://worldenergy.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Plane-on-map-iStock-1309940493-Cropped.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 00:59:39.508600

While the tone is relatively optimistic, the latest progress report uses less prescriptive language than previous editions, according to Carbon Brief analysis shown in the figure below.
In order to continue cutting emissions to meet UK climate goals, the CCC says that reductions will be needed across a broader range of sectors, including transport, buildings, industry and land-use.
These improvements are illustrated in the figure below, which shows that the credibility of UK climate policies towards the 2030 target has been steadily increasing.
However, the speed at which heat pumps are rolled out remains one of the “biggest risks” to the UK meeting its 2030 climate target, it adds.","The UK government’s official climate advisers are now “more optimistic” that the country can hit its emissions targets than they were before the Labour government was elected in July 2024.

Speaking ahead of the launch of the Climate Change Committee’s 2025 progress report, Prof Piers Forster, the CCC’s interim chair, told journalists it would be “possible” to meet the UK’s 2030 international climate goal, as well as its 2050 target to cut emissions to net-zero.

Moreover, Forster responded to attacks on climate policy from opposition parties, the Conservatives and Reform UK, by saying that reaching net-zero would, “ultimately, be good for the UK economy”.

The CCC’s report points to progress in areas such as windfarm planning rules, plans for clean power by 2030 and the accelerating adoption of clean-energy technologies for heat and transport.

It says that 38% of the emissions cuts needed to hit the UK’s 2030 target are now backed by “credible” policies, up from 25% two years earlier.

However, it says “significant risks” remain – and its top recommendation is for government action to reduce electricity prices, which would support the electrification of heat, transport and industry.

Carbon Brief has covered the CCC’s annual progress reports in 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Change of tone

This is the first progress report from the CCC to assess climate policy and action under the new Labour government, which took office in July 2024.

Last year’s edition had said that “urgent action is needed” and that the UK was “not on track” for its 2030 international climate goal, namely, a 68% reduction in emissions relative to 1990 levels.

In contrast, the 2025 report says: “This target is within reach, provided the government stays the course.”

Speaking at a pre-launch press briefing, CCC interim chair Prof Piers Forster said: “[This is] an optimistic report, [showing] that it is possible for the country to meet its climate commitments.”

Moreover, in comments aligned with the shift in language since last year, he said that the report was “more optimistic” than the 2024 edition. Forster explained:

“We are not a political organisation and our job as a committee is just to look at the evidence, but, in terms of looking at the evidence, we are more optimistic than we were this time last year.”

The reasons for this were a mixture of policies from the previous government starting to deliver and the impact of decisions taken by the new administration, he said.

While the tone is relatively optimistic, the latest progress report uses less prescriptive language than previous editions, according to Carbon Brief analysis shown in the figure below.

For example, the word “must” occurs once every 10 pages in this year’s report, down from seven times in 2021. Similarly, the word “should” only occurs four times per 10 pages, down from 13.

This shift in language appears to be a continuation of the approach taken by the committee in its advice on the UK’s seventh “carbon budget”, published in February.

(Under the Climate Change Act 2008, the government has until June 2026 to legislate for this budget, which is a legally binding emissions limit for the five-year period from 2038 to 2042.)

The committee has faced inaccurate criticism from some opponents of climate action, who have argued that it was, in effect, setting government policy.

Pushing back on this, Forster had reiterated in February: “[O]ur core responsibility…is to give…the very best non-partisan advice possible…It’s not up to us to make the policy, it’s up to government.”

Beyond the overall tone of the latest progress report, it also puts a stronger emphasis than last year’s on the need for action to reduce emissions.

It sets out the rationale for the world reaching net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to stop global warming, but also asserts the benefits this would bring to the UK in terms of energy security, a more efficient economy and lower bills:

“[C]ontinued reliance on fossil fuels undermines UK energy security…[A] fossil-fuelled future would leave the UK increasingly dependent on imports, and energy bills would remain subject to volatile fossil fuel prices.”

In language that could be interpreted as pushback against the leader of the opposition, the Conservative’s Kemi Badenoch, who recently falsely claimed that reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 was both “impossible” and only possible “by bankrupting us”, the CCC report states:

“The science is unambiguous. Only by achieving net-zero CO2 emissions, with deep reductions in other greenhouse gases, can the UK stop contributing to an ever-warmer climate…The 2050 net-zero target for the UK remains deliverable and affordable, with whole-economy costs estimated at an annual average of 0.2% of GDP.”

Asked directly if he agreed that the net-zero by 2050 target was “impossible” and would come with “catastrophic” costs – as Badenoch has asserted – Forster said that on the contrary, it was “possible” and would, “ultimately, be good for the UK economy”. He told journalists:

“We think that, provided there is further government policy, it is possible both to reach our [2030 target], our carbon budgets and then, ultimately, get to net-zero…[and that] while the benefit doesn’t come instantly…it will, ultimately, be good for the UK economy.”

The report also makes the point that the UK is far from alone in its efforts, with global investments in clean-energy technologies reaching $2tn last year, double the sum going to fossil fuels. It adds:

“Most of the world is investing heavily in low-carbon technologies, driven by falling costs, energy security concerns and a realisation of the need to respond to rising climate impacts.”

(This is despite the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and a “period of uncertainty” in international relations since the US election, the report notes.)

Overall progress

Last year’s report, published just days after Labour’s “landslide” election victory, had set the scene for the new administration, saying that it needed to “make up lost ground” to get back on track.

That report had called on the new government to “limit the damage” from Conservative climate policy rollbacks, which had been implemented ahead of the election.

This year’s report looks at how things have progressed since then, based on three sets of metrics:

First, it looks at changes to the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions over the past year.

Second, it looks at indicators of progress on the ground, such as the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), the rollout of electric heat pumps and the rate of tree-planting.

Third, it looks at policy changes introduced over the past year by the new government.

The assessment includes policy changes introduced up until 23 May 2025, meaning that it does not consider the June spending review or the industrial strategy published earlier this week.

Greenhouse gas emissions have more than halved since 1990, with a 50.4% reduction, making the UK “one of the leading economies in the world”, Forster said. The report adds:

“The UK should…be proud of its place among a leading group of economies demonstrating consistent and sustained decarbonisation.”

It says that UK emissions fell again during 2024, with a 2.5% reduction marking the tenth year of steady decline, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent rebound.

Echoing Carbon Brief analysis published in March, the CCC says that the latest drop in emissions was due to the power sector, industry and transport, where EVs are starting to have an impact.

However, the report emphasises once again that progress to date has largely come in the electricity sector, where the UK became the first country in the G7 to phase out coal power in 2024.

Indeed, the CCC says that electricity supply is now only the UK’s sixth-largest source of emissions, after surface transport, buildings, industry, agriculture and aviation, as shown in the figure below.

In order to continue cutting emissions to meet UK climate goals, the CCC says that reductions will be needed across a broader range of sectors, including transport, buildings, industry and land-use.

The pace of emissions cuts outside the power sector – an average of 8m tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) per year since 2008 – is roughly on track for the fourth carbon budget covering 2023-27.

However, the report says this pace will need to “more than double” toward the end of the decade, hitting 19MtCO2e per year, in order to hit the UK’s NDC and sixth carbon budget.

Turning to the indicators of progress on the ground, the CCC says that there are some “clear signs” of such shifts starting to take place, in areas such as transport, buildings and land-use.

For example, the report points to “significant increases” in the rates of heat-pump rollout (up 56% year-on-year in 2024), tree-planting (+59%) and peatland restoration (+47%).

(See the sections below for further detail on policies and progress in each sector.)

Policy gaps

Turning to its assessment of government climate policy, the CCC report says there has also been some “positive progress” since Labour came to office last year.

Specifically, it points to the removal of planning barriers for onshore wind and heat pumps, as well as implementation of the “clean heat market mechanism” to drive heat-pump sales, reinstatement of the 2030 combustion car ban and publication of the 2030 clean-power action plan.

As a result, the CCC says that there are now “credible policies” in place to make 38% of the emissions cuts needed to hit the UK’s 2030 target, up from 25% in 2023 and 32% last year.

At the same time, the share of emissions savings subject to policies facing “some” or “significant risks” has fallen from 53% in 2023 and 50% in 2024, down to 43% in the latest report.

These improvements are illustrated in the figure below, which shows that the credibility of UK climate policies towards the 2030 target has been steadily increasing.

Nevertheless, there are still “insufficient plans” to make 14% of the cuts needed by 2030, the same share as last year. The biggest policy gaps are around heat-pump rollout, the report says.

The CCC says: “With 39% of policies and plans needed to hit the 2030 NDC rated as having significant risks, or insufficient or unquantified plans, the government must act swiftly.”

The figure below illustrates the implications of falling to “act swiftly” more clearly.

If only the most “credible” policies actually deliver emissions savings (solid dark blue line) then the UK would miss its international targets for 2030 and 2035 (black circles) by significant margins.

The UK would get somewhat closer to its goals, if emissions cuts are successfully achieved as a result of policies subject to “some” (light blue) or “significant” delivery risks (grey line).

At the pre-launch briefing, Dr Emily Nurse, head of net-zero at the CCC, told journalists that further action was needed to get on track for the 2030 target. She said:

“Around three-fifths of what’s needed is covered by either credible plans or [those] having some risks…The UK can hit its upcoming emissions reduction targets and remain on track for net-zero, but only with further policy action.”

The government has the chance to fill these policy gaps when it publishes its updated “carbon budget delivery plan”, which has a deadline of 29 October this year.

This plan must set out how the government intends to meet the UK’s legally binding climate goals, after the previous administration’s plan was ruled unlawful by the High Court.

While there has been “good or moderate progress” on 20 of the 35 policy recommendations made last year, the CCC says there has been “no progress” on its top recommendation to make electricity cheaper.

The report says this remains its top recommendation for the second year in a row.

The reason for emphasising this, it says, is that electrification of transport, heat and industry will be the key to making required emissions cuts over the next decade, according to the CCC, with these shifts being facilitated by the expansion and continued decarbonisation of the power sector.

CCC chief executive Emma Pinchbeck told journalists that making progress in lowering electricity prices was “absolutely critical”, particularly relative to the price of gas. She said:

“The reason we keep banging on about [this], very simply, [is] that the evidence from every other country that’s had a successful rollout of electric technologies – particularly for heat – is that you need a three-to-one electricity-to-gas price ratio.”

(At present, domestic electricity prices are roughly four times higher than gas prices.)

Pinchbeck reiterated the committee’s call for the government to remove policy “levies” from electricity bills, adding that failing to do so would mean “slowing down” the transition. She said:

“If you’re effectively taxing your future fuel, you’re slowing down your energy transition, when the economy is going to become more and more dependent on electricity…It is just sensible economic policy to have cheap fuel going into your economy.”

While Pinchbeck welcomed plans in the government’s just-published industrial strategy to cut levies on industrial electricity bills, she said that it should do the same for households.

Road transport

Road-transport emissions fell for a second consecutive year in 2024, says the report.

The number of electric vehicles (EVs) on UK roads is roughly doubling every two years.

If this trend continues, the road-transport sector will produce the emissions savings required for its contribution to the UK’s 2030 climate target, the CCC says (see below).

EVs made up 19.6% of new car sales in 2024, compared to 16.1% the previous year, according to the report. In the first quarter of 2025, this figure rose to 20.7%.

This represents “strong growth”, but is below the headline targets of the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, a government regulation that requires car manufacturers to sell an increasing percentage of zero-emission vehicles each year, the CCC says.

The mandate targets a 22% market share for 2024 and a 28% share for 2025, according to the CCC.

The CCC notes that lower-cost EVs are becoming increasingly available. It adds that “price parity with petrol cars has already been reached in parts of the second-hand market”, with this milestone set to arrive for new cars by between 2026 and 2028.

Overall, there has been a “small improvement” in the UK’s policy efforts to decarbonise road transport since last year’s report, it says.

This is largely down to Labour’s decision to reinstate a 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles, which was weakened to 2035 under Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak, explains the report.

The CCC describes the move as a “welcome market signal to accelerate the transition to EVs”.

As well as reinstating the 2030 ban, the government announced changes to the ZEV mandate.

The government essentially weakened the mandate by extending flexibilities and allowing the sale of hybrid vehicles between 2030 and 2035.

Ministers said this move was in response to import tariffs announced by Donald Trump.

The CCC says the changes “risk allowing existing planned plugin hybrid vehicle sales to slightly reduce the emissions savings from EVs”, adding:

“It is also possible that manufacturers could divert investment towards [hybrids], diluting the consumer offer for EVs – we currently think that this risk is minimal due to progress in scaling up the EV market to date, but it is something that we will monitor closely.”

It adds that “for the transition to accelerate, further reductions in the cost of purchasing EVs, as well as improved access to, and reduced costs of, local public charging, are needed”.

Buildings

Heat pump installations increased by 56% in 2024 compared to the year before, the report says. Some 98,000 heat pumps were installed.

A total of 23,000 heat pumps were installed under the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which allows homeowners to claim grants for replacing fossil-fuel boilers. This is an increase of 83% on 2023 levels, says the CCC.

However, the speed at which heat pumps are rolled out remains one of the “biggest risks” to the UK meeting its 2030 climate target, it adds.

The UK’s heat pump market share is around 4%, much lower than comparable countries, such as Ireland (30%) and the Netherlands (31%), the CCC says.

The government has taken steps to “remove planning barriers” for heat pumps. This includes amending the planning policy in England to remove the requirement for planning permission for heat pumps located less than 1m from a property boundary.

However, the government has “not yet provided clarity on whether [it] will continue with the proposed phase-out of new fossil fuel boiler installations from 2035”, or “make alternative plans to ensure that low-carbon heating reaches the installation rates required”, the CCC says.

The report adds that the ratio of residential electricity to gas prices is “significantly off track”.

The ratio is important because it underpins the “underlying cost savings of switching to electric technologies are reflected in the bills paid by households and businesses”, the CCC says, continuing:

“Action has not been taken to remove policy costs from electricity prices which would address this, despite it being our first recommendation last year…Currently, a typical household with a heat pump is paying around £490 per year in policy costs, which inflate their bills above the underlying cost of the additional electricity used.”

Data from other nations suggests that the “market share of heat pump installations are correlated with more favourable electricity-to-gas price ratios”, says the CCC (see chart below).

Forster told the press briefing that the CCC’s “biggest recommendation” to government remains reducing the price of electricity in relation to gas:

“By far the most important recommendation we have for the government is to reduce the cost of electricity, both for households and for businesses and industry as well…If we want the country to benefit from the transition to electrification, we have to see it reflected in utility bills.”

The report adds that, on efforts to increase the energy efficiency of residential buildings, the “proportion of homes with insulated cavity walls has steadily increased over recent years, but this will need to accelerate later in the decade” to be in line with net-zero.

Back to top

Industry

Industry emissions decreased by 4.7MtCO2e in 2024, compared to the year before, the CCC says. Emissions are now 48% lower than 2008 levels.

From 2023-24, annual emissions dropped quickly due to the removal of blast furnaces at Port Talbot steelworks in 2024. They are due to be replaced by electric arc furnaces by 2027, with the move leading to 2,500 job losses.

The government should have developed a “more proactive and decisive transition plan” for Port Talbot and the report describes the UK’s upcoming steel strategy as “an opportunity to set out plans for the low-carbon transition at Scunthorpe steelworks and other UK steel production”.

To deliver the emissions savings needed to meet the UK’s 2030 climate goal, companies will “increasingly need to switch to electric alternatives to fossil-fuelled technology”, the report says, adding:

“A high ratio of [industrial] electricity-to-gas prices currently presents a barrier to this.”

It adds that, currently, “there is now no major source of government support for manufacturers to invest in electrification”.

The CCC notes that the government did not launch the latest round of the Industrial Energy Transformation Fund, which was due in December 2024. It has “not clarified whether this or similar funding will continue”.

On 23 June, the UK government announced a 10-year industrial strategy, including measures to slash the price of electricity for energy-intensive businesses from 2027 by exempting them from green levies.

In the press briefing, Pinchbeck described the move as “good”, but urged the government to introduce similar measures for household electricity bills, too. (See: Buildings.)

On efforts to introduce carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to UK industries, the report says progress “is not on track to be deployed at the pace required” by government plans to reach net-zero.

Back to top

Fossil fuels and hydrogen

The report says that the UK’s “continued reliance on fossil fuels undermines energy security”, continuing:

“Household energy bills rose sharply following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and have remained high since. It is the price of gas that has driven up both gas and electricity bills.”

(See Carbon Brief’s factcheck on what is causing high electricity bills in the UK.)

The report does not directly address the Labour government’s policies on oil and gas production in the North Sea.

Labour has ruled out new oil and gas licences. However, the government has indicated it might approve new projects that already have a licence, if they can pass a new environmental impact assessment that will consider the emissions from burning the oil and gas produced.

In regards to the North Sea, the report says:

“With North Sea resources largely used up, a fossil-fuelled future would leave the UK increasingly dependent on imports and energy bills would remain subject to volatile fossil fuel prices.”

The CCC adds that the “main progress in the fuel-supply sector in the past year has been around low-carbon hydrogen production”.

In the 2024 autumn budget, the government confirmed support for 11 “electrolytic”

hydrogen production projects, which are expected to start operating by the end of 2026. (These projects use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.)

Back to top

Electricity

The UK’s transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy in its electricity supply continued to drive the bulk of emissions reductions in 2024, the CCC says. It accounted for 41% of the total in-year reduction in emissions.

From the 1990s until 2024, the power sector has transformed from the largest source of emissions to only the sixth largest, behind aviation. (See: Overall progress.)

The UK’s last coal-fired power plant, Ratcliffe-on-Soar, closed in October 2024. (See Carbon Brief’s detailed explainer on how the UK became the first G7 nation to phase out coal.)

Coal emissions from electricity generation were 99% lower in 2024 than in 2008 and will reach zero in 2025, the CCC says. It describes this as a “major milestone on the UK’s path to a decarbonised power system”.

Falling gas generation accounted for 72% of emissions reductions in the power sector in 2024, the CCC says.

The electricity supplied by gas fell by 15% in 2024, compared to the previous year. This was “made up with roughly equal proportions of imports and low-carbon generation”.

The rollout of wind and solar capacity in 2024 was larger than in any of the previous six years, the report says.

But to achieve the government’s goal of “clean power” by 2030, total renewable capacity will need to more than double.

Based on projects in the pipeline, both offshore and onshore wind “appear on track” for the government’s goal, according to the CCC.

However, “roll-out of solar is significantly off track and will need to improve to deliver its contribution to a decarbonised electricity system”.

The report says that, overall, “positive policy progress has been made in decarbonising electricity supply over the past year”.

It continues that “concrete steps have been made to remove barriers and support the deployment of low-carbon technology”.

These steps include removing barriers facing onshore wind developments, “streamlin[ing]” the approval of nationally significant infrastructure, including renewable projects and introducing reforms to speed up connecting projects to the grid.

However, the CCC adds that there are “remaining uncertainties on the future electricity market arrangements and further challenges to deploying infrastructure to overcome”.

Back to top

Agriculture and land

There was a “significant increase” in both tree-planting and peatland restoration in 2024, the report says.

Some 20,700 hectares of new trees were planted, an increase of 59% on the year before and the highest rate in 20 years, it adds, as shown in the chart below.

Over the same period, the restoration of peatlands increased by 47%.

This “demonstrates that a rapid increase in rates is feasible” for the land-use sector, the CCC says.

However, woodland creation remains “slightly off track”. (Carbon Brief reported last year that successive UK governments have fallen so far short of their tree-planting targets since 2020 that they have failed to plant an area of forest nearly equivalent to the size of Birmingham.)

In addition, Scotland accounted for 73% of the total trees planted from 2023-24 and the CCC has “concerns that recent reductions in funding for woodland creation in Scotland could reverse this trend”.

A target to have 35,000 hectares of peat under restoration in England by 2025 is also “expected to be missed”.

Livestock numbers continued to fall in 2024, the report says.

Meat eating has declined steeply over the past couple of years. The average amount of meat eaten per person each week dropped by around 100g from 2020-22, according to CCC data.

Pinchbeck told the press briefing that meat-eating in the UK is now lower than what the CCC had anticipated in its central pathway for meeting net-zero:

“There’s lots of factors behind that, including the cost of living crisis. So we are not necessarily saying that trend will increase. Farming is facing a number of pressures, outside having to deal with a changing climate, reduced crop yields [and] difficulty making farms sustainable.”

Both the reduction in livestock and meat eating are “key to freeing up land required to increase tree-planting and peatland restoration”, the report says.

The government’s progress on addressing land-use sector emissions with policies has been “mixed” over the past year, according to the CCC.

The government is expected to produce a long-awaited land-use framework by the end of this year, but it “remains unclear how this framework will drive change on the ground”, the advisers say.

The government paused the sustainable farming incentive, part of the environmental land management (ELM) schemes, in March 2025.

This was due to all of the funding being allocated, which is “positive”, says the CCC. However, the decision has left a “gap in delivery grants for on-farm actions”.

The Nature for Climate Fund has been extended by one year, but is “unclear” what will happen to this scheme in the long term, it adds.

Back to top

Aviation and shipping

Emissions in the aviation sector increased by 9% year-on-year in 2024, “marking a return to pre-pandemic levels”, the report says.

In government and CCC scenarios for net-zero, emissions stay flat and start slowly decreasing over the rest of the decade, the report says, adding:

“Aviation emissions will likely exceed the trajectories assumed in all [these] pathways if they continue to increase, posing a risk to the UK’s emissions targets.”

The biggest driver of aviation emissions since 1990 has been “rising demand for international flights, particularly leisure”, it continues.

Aviation now causes more emissions than the UK’s entire power grid. In 1990, aviation emissions were 10 times lower than those from electricity, according to the report.

The CCC “recommends that the government should develop and implement policy that ensures the aviation sector takes responsibility for mitigating its emissions and, ultimately, achieving net-zero”, adding:

“This includes paying for permanent engineered removals to balance out all remaining emissions. Robust contingencies should also be in place to address any delays in decarbonisation, including through managing the forecasted increase in aviation demand.”

The share of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as a proportion of all jet fuel rose from 0.7% to 2.1% from 2023-24, the CCC says.

It notes that the SAF mandate came into force in January 2025 and the sustainable aviation fuel bill was introduced to parliament in May.

Achieving the government’s target of 10% of jet fuel from SAF by 2030 “remains uncertain as different types of SAF will need to scale up”, it adds.

There are currently no operational UK SAF plants, but some are under construction.

On shipping, the report notes that the UK has set out a maritime decarbonisation strategy, with an aim to reduce the domestic maritime sector’s fuel lifecycle emissions to zero by 2050 and interim goals of cutting pollution by 30% by 2030 and 80% by 2040, compared to 2008.

The targets are “broadly aligned” with government plans for net-zero, the CCC says.

Back to top

Other sectors

Another sector tracked by the CCC is “engineered removals”, technologies that suck CO2 out of the atmosphere.

Aside from small experiments, there is no deployment of such technologies in the UK. However, the government’s pathway for net-zero expects such methods to remove 6MtCO2e from the atmosphere by 2030, the report says, adding:

“This sector will need to develop and scale up notably over the coming five years.”

One of the CCC’s “top 10” priority actions is for the government to “finalise business models for large-scale deployment of engineered removals”.

On this, the advisers say:

“There has been little progress…This puts the contribution of engineered removals to the UK’s 2030 NDC at increasing risk.”

Another issue assessed by the CCC is waste, which produced 26.7MtCO2e in 2024, making it the eighth most polluting sector.

The report says there has been “some progress” on waste policy, but notes the government is “yet to confirm its intention to prevent biodegradable waste from going to landfill, a key measure to reduce emissions from waste”.",https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/3BJ19MA.jpg,N,,2025-06-24 21:00:22.095109

Hosted annually by Grain Trade Australia and the Australian Oilseeds Federation and being held at Melbourne’s Crown Promenade on July 30-31, its theme this year is Driving Forward – Sowing Success.

GTA chief executive officer Pat O’Shannassy said the program has been designed to provide grain market participants and service providers with the latest insights into developments locally and globally.

“We’ve lined up speakers from a diverse range of backgrounds that highlight the scope ofmarkets AGIC delegates work across in these changing times,” Mr O’Shannassy said.

Global market insights will come from US-based analyst Emily French, who started with Cargill in 1996 before joining the US Grains Council and then World Perspectives, and in investment banking in the US and Australia, prior to founding Global Ag Protein.

Speaking about global trade impacts and facilitating trade is UK-based Grain and Feed Trade Association director general and Federation of Commodity Associations chair Jaine Chisholm Caunt.

“Both these speakers are leaders in their field, and as we come to terms with global unrest that is changing our trading environment, their insights will be invaluable.”

As always, domestic markets and their interface with international pricing are prominent in the AGIC program, and will look at everything from bread, courtesy of Bakers Delights founders Lesley and Roger Gillespie, to sustainable aviation fuel in the remit of Neste general manager James Williamson.

“Every tonne of grain processed locally, whether it’s for human consumption, feed, or biofuels, can add value to Australian economy.”

“To dive into what we are doing currently, and further opportunities that exist, our value-adding panel has a representative from each sector.”

Joining Mr Williamson on that panel will be Mauri head of commodity Michael Schmidt and Patrick Hutchinson, who has vast experience in the meat industry and is now principal of Gibraltar Strategic Advisory.

The latest on the Australian market, including the impact of drought in south-eastern Australia, will be covered by a panel facilitated by Mauri commodity price-risk manager Erin Burns, and comprising Louis Dreyfus Company Australia senior commodity trader pulses Simone Dax, Riordan Grains chief commercial officer Mark Lewis, and Cargill Australia trading manager Sam Napier.

Delegates are invited to register for AGIC at the early-bird rate by July 4, and growers have a subsidised rate available to them thanks to the Grains Research and Development Corporation.

Of particular interest to the grower and others in the supply chain will be the panel looking at how growers are driving forward and sowing success.It will canvass the views and experiences of CBH Board chair Simon Stead, South Bunarba Agriculture general manager Sam Heagney, Mungindi, and Kate Gunn, who farms in her family’s Merrivale partnership on the Liverpool Plains, and chairs commercial and research organisation AMPS Agribusiness.

Two former federal politicians, Simon Birmingham and Warren Entsch, will also be taking the stage.

Now ANZ Banking Group’s head of Asia Pacific engagement and chair, South Australia, Mr Birmingham will touch on topics including trade policy, government finance, international relations, and regulated environments.

Expect Mr Entsch’s topics, under the heading of From Crocodiles to Cairns to Canberra, to be a little more free-wheeling, and enlightened by his 25 years representing Far North Queensland’s Leichhardt electorate.

Other speakers and panelists include:

Grains Australia Trade & Market Access general manager John Ackerman;

Cropify CEO and co-founder Anna Falkiner;

Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries secretary Adam Fennessy;

GrainGrowers CEO Shona Gawel;

Champion swimmer and health advocate Michael Klim;

Production and Types of Sustainable Aviation Fuels

Sustainable aviation fuels are made from renewable resources, such as biomass, waste materials, or synthetic fuels produced using renewable energy. The production process for SAF involves several steps, including feedstock collection, conversion, and refining.

Overview of SAF Production Processes

There are several production pathways for SAF, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common pathways include:

Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis: This process involves converting biomass or waste materials into a synthetic gas, which is then converted into a liquid fuel using the FT process.

Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA): This process involves converting vegetable oils or animal fats into a hydrocarbon fuel through hydroprocessing.

Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ): This process involves converting alcohols, such as ethanol or butanol, into a jet fuel using a catalytic conversion process.

The following flowchart illustrates the different SAF production pathways:

Types of Feedstocks Used in SAF Production

The feedstocks used in SAF production can vary widely, depending on the production pathway. Some common feedstocks include:

Biomass: Agricultural waste, forestry residues, and algae are all potential biomass feedstocks.

Waste materials: Municipal solid waste, waste cooking oil, and other waste materials can be used to produce SAF.

Synthetic fuels: Fuels produced using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, can be used to produce SAF.

Comparison of Different SAF Production Pathways

Each SAF production pathway has its own advantages and disadvantages, including differences in cost, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions. The following table compares the different pathways:

Production Pathway Feedstock Energy Efficiency Greenhouse Gas Emissions Fischer-Tropsch Biomass or waste 40-60% 50-80% reduction HEFA Vegetable oils or animal fats 80-90% 50-80% reduction ATJ Alcohols 60-80% 50-80% reduction

Benefits and Challenges of SAF Implementation

The adoption of SAF has several benefits, including reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. However, there are also challenges associated with scaling up SAF production.

Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions

SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional fossil fuels. This is because SAF is made from renewable resources, which absorb CO2 during their growth cycle. The following equation illustrates the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions:

GHG reduction=GHG emissions (fossil fuel)−GHG emissions (SAF)GHG emissions (fossil fuel)×100 \text{GHG reduction} = \frac{\text{GHG emissions (fossil fuel)} - \text{GHG emissions (SAF)}}{\text{GHG emissions (fossil fuel)}} \times 100 GHG reduction=GHG emissions (fossil fuel)GHG emissions (fossil fuel)−GHG emissions (SAF)​×100

For example, a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation found that SAF produced using the FT pathway can reduce GHG emissions by up to 75% compared to traditional fossil fuels 1.

Air Quality Improvements

SAF can also improve air quality by reducing emissions of particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide. A study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that SAF produced using the HEFA pathway can reduce particulate matter emissions by up to 90% compared to traditional fossil fuels 2.

Challenges in Scaling Up SAF Production

Despite the benefits of SAF, there are several challenges associated with scaling up production. These include:

High production costs: SAF is currently more expensive than traditional fossil fuels, making it challenging to compete in the market.

Limited availability of feedstocks: The availability of feedstocks, such as biomass or waste materials, can be limited in certain regions.

Infrastructure constraints: The existing infrastructure for fuel production and distribution may not be suitable for SAF.

The following mind map illustrates the challenges associated with scaling up SAF production:
