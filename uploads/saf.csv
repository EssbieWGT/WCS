Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

Airport General Manager

With guidance from the Federal Aviation Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) amid evolving health and safety guidelines, Bheodari steadfastly encouraged collaboration among stakeholders, team-building among aviation employees, and adaptability in uncertain times. Throughout the pandemic, he participated in daily calls with Airports Council International and other large-hub airports to share best practices as well as information from Washington, D.C. federal offices and the CDC.

He aimed to restore customer confidence and ensure the airport was a healthy facility using COVID-19 safe protocols. Since, the airport achieved Airport of the Year by the Airport Minority Advisory Council (AMAC).

During the height of the pandemic, Bheodari was the most ardent supporter of our mission-critical employees. Having worked his way up through the ranks, he fully appreciates the oftentimes thankless jobs these employees perform that keep the Airport safe and running optimally at all times. Morale never flagged because Bheodari made sure those employees felt valued through hazard pay, special meals, social media posts, intranet spotlight features, and other incentives.

His actions and his directives all reflect his commitment to the three key focus areas of our organisation’s strategic plan: people, purpose and performance.

CEO

Rep. David Steffen, R-Howard, as well as Sens. Romaine Quinn of Birchwood and Patrick Testin of Stevens Point, recently sent a co-sponsorship memo to other lawmakers on the legislation.

“Wisconsin can lead the way in championing the production of this sustainable fuel, providing our farmers and timber producers with a long-term, reliable path in our everchanging global economy,” they wrote.

Under the bill, the state would create an income and franchise tax credit of $1.50 per gallon of “sustainable aviation fuel” or SAF produced in Wisconsin, starting in 2028. It’s defined in the bill as aviation fuel that’s at least 90% derived from synthetic, renewable and nonpetroleum sources.

SAF has similar properties to standard jet fuel, but has a smaller carbon footprint, according to an overview from the U.S. Department of Energy. Depending on how it’s made, the fuel can produce “dramatically” lower emissions, and the agency says some emerging pathways for production have a net-negative emissions footprint.

Bill authors note it’s made from renewable agricultural resources including “low value” energy crops. Potential feedstocks can include corn grain, oil seeds, forestry residues, wet wastes such as manure and even algae. DOE says using wet wastes has the added benefit of reducing pollution on watersheds while also reducing greenhouse gases.

SAF could provide a boost to Wisconsin’s growing $4.2 billion biofuels industry, which employs more than 19,000 people, the lawmakers wrote in the memo.

“While there is currently no production of SAF occurring in Wisconsin, our state is in a prime position to become a hub for SAF production, both geographically, and because of our strong agricultural outputs,” they wrote.

The partnership will see Microsoft co-fund 39,000 tonnes of SAF, translating to a projected reduction of 113,000 tonnes of lifecycle carbon emissions. The goal? To tackle Scope 3 emissions—the often-overlooked category that includes everything from business travel to freight shipping, and one of the hardest to address in corporate climate strategies.

The deal isn’t just about emissions—it’s about market-making. SAF remains expensive and underproduced. By signing long-term contracts, Microsoft and IAG are helping stabilize demand and give fuel producers confidence to scale up supply.

The SAF will be produced by:

Phillips 66’s Humberside refinery (UK), using used cooking oil and food waste

LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels plant (USA), the first commercial-scale alcohol-to-jet fuel facility

Both sources are certified by the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC), ensuring credible climate benefits.

“This long-term deal brings us closer to our goal of being carbon negative by 2030,” said Julia Fidler, Microsoft’s Lead for Fuel and Materials Decarbonization. “And it helps accelerate SAF production globally.”

Microsoft has positioned itself as one of the few tech companies making direct bets on clean fuels. Its $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund has already invested in SAF innovators like LanzaJet. The new agreement with IAG extends that commitment to business air travel and global logistics tied to its data centers.

For IAG, it’s a reinforcement of strategy. The airline group has now invested more than $3.5 billion in SAF, and in 2024, sustainable fuel made up 1.9% of its total fuel usage—a figure that remains small, but industry-leading.

“Long-term agreements like this give the confidence needed to scale SAF production,” said Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s Group Sustainability Officer.

The aviation industry accounts for roughly 2-3% of global emissions, but it remains one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonize. That’s why Microsoft and IAG’s move is being closely watched.

This partnership highlights how corporations and airlines can collaborate to accelerate clean fuel markets while hitting their own climate targets. It’s also a glimpse into how voluntary corporate climate leadership might be the key to unlocking progress where regulation alone has struggled.",https://esgbroadcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-61.png,N,,2025-04-08 08:56:34.449689

The year 2025 marks a pivotal moment for aviation in the United Kingdom. With the introduction of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate, the country signals a clear commitment to decarbonising air travel. This development arrives alongside government support for expanding runways at major airports, aligning growth with sustainability imperatives. While many see this as a regulatory necessity, there is a deeper narrative at play. The mandate presents an extraordinary opportunity to reimagine the future of aviation through innovation, collaboration, and visionary thinking.

The Urgency of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Aviation faces one of the most complex decarbonisation challenges of any sector. Improvements in airframe design, engine efficiency, and smarter flight operations will certainly help. Yet, the fuel that powers aircraft remains largely unchanged. Conventional kerosene is deeply entrenched, and while electric and hydrogen aircraft are on the horizon, their widespread adoption remains distant and primarily suited to shorter routes.

In contrast, Sustainable Aviation Fuel stands out as a practical solution. Compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure, SAF provides a meaningful path forward. It allows airlines to reduce emissions without waiting for entirely new technologies. However, realising its potential depends on overcoming several substantial hurdles.

Overcoming Barriers to SAF Adoption

Scaling SAF production is not without its challenges. Feedstock availability is limited, and current production technologies are expensive. Traditional SAF pathways such as hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids are already costly, and innovative methods like alcohol-to-jet and Power-to-Liquid are even more so.

Projections indicate that reaching the ambitious 2050 targets could require investments between three and five trillion dollars beyond a scenario without SAF. Unlike solar and wind energy, where economies of scale have sharply reduced costs, SAF may not follow the same trajectory due to feedstock constraints. As demand rises, reliance on higher-cost production pathways could keep prices elevated.

Yet, this complex landscape creates fertile ground for creative solutions and novel collaborations.

Unlocking Innovation Across the Ecosystem

Rather than viewing these challenges as insurmountable, the aviation sector is embracing them as catalysts for innovation. The SAF mandate acts as a lever to unlock new possibilities across the value chain.

Collaboration Becomes a Cornerstone

Airlines, fuel producers, investors, governments, and even passengers are increasingly aligned in their efforts. Cross-sector partnerships are emerging, fostering shared commitments to decarbonisation goals. These collaborations accelerate progress, create shared value, and build resilience in an evolving market.

Advancing Book and Claim Systems

One of the most promising advancements lies in the evolution of book and claim systems. These mechanisms allow the environmental benefits of SAF to be traded separately from the physical fuel itself. By decoupling these components, airlines and fuel producers can optimise logistics and distribution, reducing costs and expanding market reach. Book and claim is a quiet revolution within the SAF market, enhancing its accessibility and attractiveness.

Airports as Future Energy Hubs

Airports are evolving beyond their traditional role. They are poised to become dynamic energy hubs, integrating SAF production, storage, and distribution into their operations. This transformation requires rethinking logistics, optimising production locations, and reconfiguring infrastructure to accommodate sustainable fuels. Airports embracing this role will not only support decarbonisation but also create new revenue streams and community value.

Building Market Confidence Through Policy Support

The UK mandate is designed not just to increase SAF usage but also to build confidence among investors. By setting clear targets and limits, particularly favouring novel and high-cost pathways such as Power-to-Liquid, the policy aims to stimulate market activity and attract essential funding. Regulatory certainty reassures stakeholders that their investments will be supported, encouraging long-term commitments to sustainable fuel development.

This supportive framework ensures that the SAF mandate does more than mandate compliance. It creates a nurturing environment for experimentation, entrepreneurship, and enterprise.

Embracing the Opportunity for Growth

What may have begun as a policy requirement is fast becoming a beacon of opportunity. The journey towards sustainable aviation is not linear, nor is it without obstacles. Yet, the SAF mandate fosters a mindset shift. It encourages the industry to see beyond immediate challenges and focus instead on the transformative possibilities that sustainable fuel offers.

Market Leadership for the United Kingdom

By embracing SAF, the United Kingdom positions itself as a global leader in sustainable aviation. The country is shaping not just its domestic aviation market but also influencing global standards and best practices. This leadership opens the door to export opportunities, knowledge sharing, and new diplomatic and economic partnerships.

Inspiring Innovation Beyond Aviation

The ripple effects extend far beyond airports and airlines. Advancements in SAF production technologies can benefit other hard-to-abate sectors. Lessons learned in feedstock management, carbon accounting, and supply chain optimisation have the potential to inspire broader industrial transformation.

Conclusion: Charting the Course for a Cleaner Sky

The United Kingdom’s SAF mandate marks the dawn of a new era for aviation. Rather than viewing it purely as a regulatory hurdle, the industry is recognising it as a springboard for innovation, collaboration, and sustainable growth. Through collective effort, pioneering technology, and forward-looking policies, the skies of tomorrow can be cleaner and more sustainable.

The mandate provides a unique opportunity to turn ambition into action. As the industry continues to push boundaries, the future of aviation will not only be fuelled by sustainable resources but also by the shared commitment to creating a better world for generations to come.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-45-6-1024x576-1.png,N,,2025-04-08 08:56:49.922164

Qantas is using the Airbus A350-1000 for its “Project Sunrise”, with plans to launch non-stop flights to London and New York from Sydney in mid-2026, amid a fleet upgrade that include the Airbus A321XLR arriving within months.

The duo set up a US$200 million partnership in 2022 to help accelerate SAF production and will invest from that fund.

Airbus Chief Sustainability Office Julie Kitcher and Qantas Chief Sustainability Officer Fiona Messent said they chose CTP because it works closely with corporate partners to identify and support technology solutions for aviation.

They hope the initiative will help bridge a gap the aviation giants identified between early-stage climate technologies and at-scale commercial production in Australia.

“Decarbonising aviation at speed and scale requires bold action and collaboration across sectors – from airlines, manufacturers and airports to regulators, governments and investors,” Kitcher said.

“This partnership with CTP and Qantas highlights that the scaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel needs innovative solutions for a nascent technology that will drive innovation, attract investment and create new jobs in Australia, which I believe is well positioned to be a leader in low carbon fuels.”

The investment focus will be on technologies for SAF production, feedstock development and other value-chain innovations and will sit alongside Climate Tech Partner’s main fund.

CTP has 12 partners – leaders in sectors ranging from energy generation to infrastructure – to provide mentorship and strategic guidance to enable further collaboration.

CTP will invest on behalf of Qantas and Airbus into leading local and global startups focused on SAF and other innovative technologies. The airline and plane builder will also have the option to explore further follow-on and direct investments to support the deployment of those startup solutions in real-world Australian projects.

Fiona Messent from Qantas said sustainable aviation fuel is the most effective tool they have to decarbonise aviation.

“This partnership will help provide a vote of confidence in new technologies so they can be developed, scaled and integrated in the SAF supply chain, while also providing companies with access to Qantas and Airbus as they develop and test their solutions,” she said.

“For Australia, an onshore SAF industry will mean improved national fuel security, more jobs and economic benefit, so it’s fantastic to be collaborating across industries to help accelerate local production.”

CTP invests globally, primarily at the Series A stage, across the energy & power, transport & logistics, and industrials & resources.The BESEN Family Office is an investor in both Climate Tech Partners and CTP main fund.

While airlines are taking interest, adoption has been slow for sustainable aviation fuel, which can be made from feedstocks such as agricultural waste and cooking oils.

This is in part due to the increased cost compared to conventional fuels, though Kitcher says economies of scale can help mitigate the “green premium”.

“We need to pull on the demand side, and we need to give fuel suppliers that visibility of the demand and uptake agreements to give security for the investments to be able to scale,” she said.

“We also need production incentives so that the fuel producers have the opportunity to invest in their facilities and be able to ramp up the production. So, it’s really on both sides that we need to work.”

SAF is a safe, nearly identical replacement for conventional jet fuel and could cut aviation fuel emissions by up to 80%, with the potential for a 100% reduction in the future. This makes SAF a crucial step toward achieving the aviation sector’s net-zero carbon emissions goal by 2050.

Since the first biofuel test flight on a commercial plane in 2008, the industry and its partners have made significant progress. SAF has been certified by ASTM International, the global fuel standards body. Since 2011, over 750,000 flights have used blends of SAF and traditional fuel.

On October 7, 2022, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) set a long-term aspirational goal (LTAG) of achieving net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050. ICAO is a specialised agency of the United Nations that leads the international alignment of technical standards and strategies, facilitating the safe, secure, and sustainable development of its 193 member states’ aviation sectors and air services.

During the 41st ICAO Assembly held in September and October 2022, the member states adopted the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) long-term aspirations to formalise an international agreement to reduce aviation-related carbon emissions.

This agreement is structured similarly to the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2018 Initial Greenhouse Gas Strategy but establishes a more ambitious long-term reduction target. Just as the IMO’s agreement has prompted new policies and investments in low- and zero-emission ships, the ICAO policy can potentially be a significant catalyst for change in the aviation sector.

The new flagship report produced by Airports of Tomorrow, an initiative of the World Economic Forum, is titled “Global Aviation Sustainability Outlook 2025.” This report brings together leaders from across the aviation industry. It is based on interviews with top executives from the World Economic Forum’s aviation community and discussions held in 2024. Its purpose is to provide an overview of the significant risks and opportunities affecting the progress of aviation decarbonisation in 2025.

The main concerns identified focus on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) availability and cost, geopolitical tensions, and the tariffs associated with growing protectionism. The overarching goal is to accelerate the aviation industry’s efforts regarding SAF, battery-electric, and hydrogen aviation technologies to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

In late 2024 and early 2025, Chief Executive Officers from the World Economic Forum’s aviation community were asked: How can the aviation industry achieve the ambitious goal of net-zero emissions while expanding? What actions and priorities need to be taken? What risks should public-private collaboration focus on this year to accelerate progress toward decarbonisation?

These discussions aim to capture the evolution of aviation executives’ perspectives over time and highlight ongoing opportunities for public-private collaboration. Their responses have informed this report, which seeks to set the agenda for discussions in the year ahead.

The views of aviation executives interviewed for this report reveal several challenges impacting climate action. Some risks are specific to the aviation sector, while others arise from broader economic and geopolitical constraints.

Below are the top ten risks affecting the aviation decarbonisation progress outlined in the WEF report:

Despite challenges in 2024, including the SAF plant closures, scrapped projects, and delays in policy guidance and incentives, the 30 C-suite executives interviewed for this report remained cautiously optimistic regarding the decarbonisation goals of the aviation industry. More than two-thirds were confident that the momentum for aviation decarbonisation will continue in 2025, with a minority voicing neutral or negative expectations for the year ahead.

To align with the priorities outlined in the report, the World Economic Forum’s sustainable aviation initiatives for 2025 will focus on the following:

1. Continuing discussions on SAF policy and geopolitics to identify regional synergies and promote increased investment in SAF production while boosting demand, particularly in emerging markets.

2. Maintaining emphasis on zero-emissions propulsion and infrastructure, with an upcoming report on how airports can serve as energy hubs. This report will include a comprehensive analysis of the feasibility of multi-fuel applications at airports.

3. Exploring how innovation can support aviation climate adaptation and mitigation by sharing best practices and solutions that airports and airlines implement to disseminate key findings and lessons learned.",https://climateadaptationplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/climate-adaptation-Key-Risks-and-Opportunities.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 02:56:09.822057

The “Promoting the Production of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) from Agricultural Waste in the ASEAN Region” project marks a significant step towards a more sustainable aviation future in Southeast Asia. It was carried out by the ASEAN Secretariat, GHD, Boeing, Canadian Trade and Investment Facility for Development (CTIF), funded by Global Affairs Canada (GAC), and implemented by Cowater International, the Institute of Public Administrators of Canada (IPAC).

SAF is a renewable or waste-derived aviation fuel that meets sustainability criteria, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and is compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure, as a “drop-in” fuel. Aviation engines can currently run on a mix of 50% SAF and 50% conventional aviation fuel, but the industry is working towards a 100% SAF mix. SAF lowers carbon emissions over the fuel’s life cycle by up to 80%, depending on the feedstock, with the potential to reduce even more in the future. SAF can be made from a wide variety of sources: cover crops and other nonedible plants, agricultural and forestry waste, non-recyclable municipal waste, industrial plant off-gassing and other feedstocks.

As part of the project, a techno-economic assessment was conducted in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, focusing on feedstock availability, technology pathways, carbon intensity, logistics, environmental and social aspects, institutional frameworks, and financial assessment.

With improvements in economic feasibility, SAF production in ASEAN could surpass regional demand, enabling exports both within and beyond ASEAN.

The expansion of SAF feedstock supply is expected to stem from enhanced farming practices and large-scale biomass utilisation rather than land expansion. The report emphasised that mechanisation, improved irrigation, and R&D in crop optimisation could boost feedstock availability without increasing deforestation or land conversion.

Beyond environmental benefits, the project highlighted SAF’s role in fostering gender equality and economic development. The SAF sector offers opportunities for job creation, upskilling, and workforce diversification, with a strong emphasis on inclusive participation of women and marginalised communities.

Deputy Secretary-General for the ASEAN Economic Community, Satvinder Singh, commended the initiative, stating: “This initiative marks a significant step in advancing ASEAN’s commitment to sustainable aviation. By leveraging regional resources and innovation, we are not only addressing environmental challenges but also driving economic growth and enhancing energy security. The successful completion of this project underscores ASEAN’s capacity for effective collaboration in tackling climate challenges while creating new opportunities for our communities.”

CTIF Project Manager Hendry Predy also commented on the initiative stating “CTIF technical assistance supported Southeast Asia countries with a project to improve the ability of the energy sector to assess the reliability of the upstream feedstock supply and the potential for sustained use and production within the region. The recommendations from the proposed project informed on the future development and operation of the pilot areas in selected member countries (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam) to convert agricultural waste and residues to SAF. The project and recommendations supported the ASEAN Secretariat in ascertaining the reliability of feedstock supply for renewable fuels.”

Sharmine Tan, Boeing’s regional sustainability lead for Southeast Asia said “SAF is the biggest opportunity to cut aviation emissions over the next 30 years. This research highlights Southeast Asia’s rich SAF feedstock potential, positioning the region as a key player in meeting global SAF demand. To unlock this potential, governments and industry must act decisively, harmonise sustainability policies, invest in infrastructure, and scale local production to build a robust regional SAF ecosystem. Southeast Asia has a unique opportunity to lead sustainable aviation while driving economic growth and environmental stewardship.”

Sachin Narang, GHD’s Executive Advisor – Energy and Infrastructure, said, “The successful completion of this project represents a major milestone in ASEAN’s journey toward sustainable aviation. The insights gained will serve as a foundation for future SAF initiatives, investments, and policy development across the region.”

The ASEAN Secretariat, together with its partners, invites continued collaboration with governments, industry leaders, research institutions, and investors to support the regional transition to SAF. Building on the findings of this project, the next phase will focus on areas such as enabling policy development, strengthening technical capacity, and mobilising investment to support SAF deployment, among other collaborative efforts. Together, ASEAN governments, businesses and communities can help shape a sustainable aviation future that contributes meaningfully to regional and global sustainability goals.

This is not just another corporate announcement. It represents a shift in how businesses view their responsibility within the wider carbon ecosystem.

Their extended agreement focuses on an additional commitment to sustainable aviation fuel, aiming to cut life cycle emissions by an impressive amount. It is currently considered the largest and longest agreement of its kind according to public data. This move is a signal that the future of corporate responsibility lies in collaborative action rather than isolated efforts.

Understanding the Impact of Scope Three Emissions

To appreciate the importance of this agreement, one must first understand the concept of scope three emissions. Unlike direct emissions, scope three emissions come from activities not directly owned or controlled by a company. This includes everything from the sourcing of raw materials to the impact of business travel.

For industries that rely heavily on global supply chains and transportation, like aviation and technology, these emissions form a significant part of their overall carbon footprint. Addressing them is essential for any meaningful progress towards decarbonisation.

Through this agreement, the technology company is making tangible progress on its scope three emissions. In doing so, they are demonstrating that responsibility extends beyond operational boundaries and into the wider value chain.

A Strategy Beyond Carbon Reduction

What makes this partnership truly distinctive is its layered approach. The agreement does not just focus on fuel purchases. It also extends to supporting logistics operations by using sustainable aviation fuel for transporting data centre components globally.

By integrating sustainability into its freight operations, the technology corporation is advancing its goal of becoming carbon-negative by the end of the decade. At the same time, the airline group benefits from increased demand for sustainable aviation fuel, encouraging further production and industry growth.

This kind of integrated thinking shows a maturity in climate strategy. It moves beyond simple offsetting into embedded, systemic change.

The Critical Role of Long-Term Agreements

One of the most powerful aspects of this collaboration lies in its long-term vision. Short-term purchases of sustainable aviation fuel provide immediate benefits, but long-term commitments have a much deeper impact.

When businesses commit to multi-year agreements, they provide the certainty that fuel producers need to invest confidently in scaling up production. In this case, the agreement supports facilities in both the United Kingdom and the United States, using waste-based feedstocks like cooking oil and food waste.

Such sustained demand signals encourage investment in next-generation fuel technologies. This is exactly what is required to shift the entire aviation sector away from fossil dependence.

Certified Sustainability at the Core

The fuels produced under this agreement are certified by recognised bodies ensuring they meet stringent sustainability criteria. This level of certification gives assurance that the reductions in life cycle emissions are genuine and verifiable.

Moreover, the fuel suppliers themselves represent innovation. For example, the United States facility involved is the first commercial-scale alcohol to jet production site in the world. These pioneering developments are what will enable aviation to meet its ambitious climate targets.

Shared Responsibility Leads to Shared Progress

Perhaps the most inspiring aspect of this partnership is its demonstration of shared responsibility. By co-funding sustainable aviation fuel purchases, the technology corporation and the airline group are showing that climate solutions are most powerful when designed collaboratively.

Neither organisation could achieve this impact alone. Together, they amplify their influence, demonstrating that collective action is not just desirable, but essential for meaningful progress.

This partnership also serves as a signal to other industries. It shows that even sectors with hard-to-abate emissions can make significant progress through creative, collaborative strategies.

Conclusion: A Blueprint for the Future of Aviation Sustainability

This partnership between an aviation leader and a technology giant offers more than just positive headlines. It provides a blueprint for future collaborations across industries seeking to address complex carbon challenges.

By understanding their mutual impact, committing to long-term agreements, and supporting the scale-up of sustainable fuel production, they are actively reshaping the future of aviation.

This is a future where sustainability is not an afterthought but embedded in every decision. It is a future where supply chains, fuel suppliers, and customers are united by a common goal.

Most importantly, it is a future where the collective power of responsible businesses can move an entire industry towards genuine decarbonisation.",https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/images/email/artdeco/logos/96/linkedin-bug-color.png,N,,2025-04-08 08:57:26.198324

The aviation industry is promoting mixing SAF with jet fuel because SAF produces up to 80% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fuel, according to media reports citing various forecasts.

Bangchak adjusted its estimated payback period to 5-7 years, extended from 3-5 years in a previous feasibility study, in response to changes in the SAF market.

""We are confident we have an opportunity to make a profit,"" said Mr Chaiwat.

The company's 10-billion-baht SAF factory is scheduled to open on April 25 for a test run, with used cooking oil as a raw material.

Demand for SAF is projected to soar after 2030 because the aviation industry will not find other clean fuels by that time, or be able to shift to battery-powered aircraft on a commercial scale, according to Bangchak. In 2030, the number of air travellers is expected to tally 12 billion, up from 6 billion in 2024.

""If the aviation industry does nothing to achieve carbon neutrality, it will be branded as a very dirty industry,"" he said.

According to the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the International Air Transport Association, the EU requires airlines to mix 2% SAF with jet fuel by 2030. SAF proportions of 10% apply in the UK and the US in 2030.

Bangchak plans to start commercial production of SAF in the middle of this year, amounting to half of its full capacity of 1 million litres a day. The capacity of 1 million litres is calculated from an estimate that Thailand will use 5% SAF mixed with conventional oil, based on actual jet fuel supply of 20 million litres a day in 2019.

Bangchak partners with food and beverage operators to buy used cooking oil, and it already signed contracts to sell SAF to its customers.

As of April 3, the ex-refinery price of SAF was 48 baht a litre, compared with 21-22 baht a litre for conventional oil, meaning the government subsidies may be needed, said Mr Chaiwat.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2025/04/08/5546569_700.jpg,N,,2025-04-07 20:56:31.276520

""I think it gets to the heart of a lot of fossil fuel advertising, which is essentially lobbying in public,"" said Meisel.
It's a message fossil fuel companies hope will resonate with college sports fans.","Americans love college sports, and so do oil and gas companies.

About 96% of more than 2,000 fossil fuel ads aired during live national games between 2022 and 2024 were during college football and basketball, compared to about 4% for professional sports, according to a CBS News data analysis of data from television ad tracking firm, iSpot.tv.

Duncan Meisel, a climate activist and a leading voice against advertising by fossil fuel companies, said many of these ads during televised games talk about supporting communities and the environment without ever acknowledging the industry's role in climate change.

""The problem is they're selling a product that they know harms people, that they know harms the planet,"" Meisel said.

About one in ten of the more than 2,000 ads carried a pro-climate message, like recycling cooking oil for renewable diesel, ""sustainable"" aviation fuel, lower carbon emissions or fuel made from corn.

While Meisel didn't dispute the accuracy of these claims, he emphasized that they're not these companies' main goal, and likely a very small percentage of what they produce.

CBS News reached out to Valero for comment on its ads highlighting renewable diesel and aviation fuel, but the company has not responded in time for this story's publication.

It's an effective business strategy to advertise during college sports, according to Peter Carton, who directs the Sports Management program at Southern Methodist University.

Carton said the college sports demographic tends to be middle-to-upper income. The return on investment for these companies is higher than for pro sports, because it's cheaper to advertise.

""When they look at where do they want to put their advertising dollars and marketing dollars to reach certain demographics, college is much more efficient,"" Carton said.

""You're very familiar, I'm sure we all are, with the cost of advertising on the Super Bowl. That's outside of the reach of many, many companies. But to be able to get a very passionate, dedicated consumer base, that's the college market,"" he said.

""I think it gets to the heart of a lot of fossil fuel advertising, which is essentially lobbying in public,"" said Meisel.

Which Airline Has Disappointed You The Most?

It is hard to be disappointed with low-cost and ultra-low-cost carriers, at least when things run as they should. After all, they have a bare-bones approach, meaning expectations are usually low. It’s then easy to meet or even exceed them. The same cannot be said for the spectrum of ‘full’-service carriers, which often overpromise and underdeliver. It is hard to pinpoint one airline that has disappointed me the most because some aspects of the experience could be good, while others may not. One flight might be less than desirable, while the next – if there is a next time – might be noticeably, or at least acceptably, better. Such inconsistencies only add to the trouble.

World Atlantic Airlines Has 3 Aircraft Seized In Miami: Is This The End Of The Line?

This is user-generated content. The views and opinions expressed here are not necessarily those of Simple Flying. Recently, a Florida court ordered the seizure of three McDonnell Douglas MD-83 aircraft belonging to World Atlantic Airlines until the airline pays up $1.8 million to Blue Diamond General Investments. The three aircraft seized were N801WA, N802WA, and N804WA. Recently, the airline has mostly been operating 'charters' to Cuba. At the time of writing, 801 seems to be flying, 802 is sitting on the ground in Cuba with engine failure, and 804 is nearly 40 years old and hasn't flown in a while.

Given oneworld Alliance carrier Alaska Airlines’ recent acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines, it would appear another brand is set to join the oneworld fold. The smallest of the three major airline alliances with just 13 current members, the group has the potential to grow even further. Two airlines have already confirmed they will be joining the program in the coming months. Fiji Airways (which is set to adopt the American Airlines AAdvantage loyalty program) and Oman Air (the second Gulf carrier to join oneworld following Qatar Airways) will officially join the group. Speaking to Simple Flying’s Sumit Singh earlier this summer, oneworld CEO Nathaniel Pieper said that any future airlines must bring a range of new destinations without significantly eroding the market share of existing oneworld carriers. Which airlines do you think have a complimentary network that would fit well in the oneworld Alliance?

Which Airline Needs To Update Its Livery?

Simple Flying's reporting on Delta Air Line's new ""100 Years"" livery got me thinking: The standard Delta livery has been around for quite a while now. Since 2007, in fact, so the better part of two decades. Which is interesting, because the airline seemed to change it quite frequently prior to that. But the liveries of other airlines have been around even longer. British Airways' ""Chatham Dockyard"" livery dates back to 1997, and Singapore Airlines and Korean Airlines have been largely unchanged (bar some minor tweaks to the titles) since the late 1980s. I believe that Philippine Airlines holds the record for the oldest livery, unchanged since it was introduced 40 years ago. You can argue that it's good to stick with a solid brand that everyone recognizes. But sometimes even the most well-recognized brands need a refresh. So with that in mind... Which airline needs to update its livery?

I Was A Commercial Pilot For 51 Years. Ask Me Anything!

I began my commercial flying career at 18 while still in high school. I was fortunate to spend the next 50+ years doing what has been described as ""The Best Job in the World,"" that of a professional pilot. At age 23, I received an FAA flight check for Airline Transport Pilot and was designated as Captain for an airline. Since then, I have served airlines from the smallest start-up to some of the largest carriers in the world. Ask me anything! Edit: Thank you all for asking me questions. The AMA has concluded now. It was a pleasure to talk about my flying career, and I hope that I can share more with you in the near future!

What Is Your Most Flown Airline?

While there are several factors at play when choosing a flight, many people will tend to gravitate towards a particular airline. This could be because they live near a base, have frequent flyer status, or simply prefer the service on offer. I track all of my flights in the Flighty app, and today took a look at my most flown airlines and was slightly surprised to see British Airways claiming the top spot with 49 flights compared to 41 at Ryanair (which I had expected to be at the top)! Equally cool is Air Astana with 7 flights from a single trip to Kazakhstan last summer. What are your most flown airlines? Join the conversation below!

Where Would You Like United Airlines To Fly The Airbus A321XLR?

United plans to have 50 Airbus A321XLRs, with the first aircraft due to enter service in 2025. Naturally, the carrier said they’ll partly replace the Boeing 757-200ER, including to Europe. Unlike the A321LR, a variant United does not have and has not ordered, the XLR is a true 757 replacement – just with a longer range and much better fuel burn. The XLR may also help United to make some seasonal routes year-round while right-sizing capacity with demand on others, freeing up other equipment to be used elsewhere. It may also enable higher frequencies. More interesting are new route possibilities. While necessarily vague, United said, “The XLR can fly much further [than the 757] and will open new stations that either don't have service from an airline today [from the US], or they don't have United service.” Where would you like the carrier to fly the type? Let us know!

From Lab to Talent Pipeline: Dr. Atim Enyenihi Shares Insights on Building Pathways, Breaking Barriers, and Talent Development

""The real problem is retention,"" says Dr. Atim Enyenihi, Technology and Innovation Strategic Industry Advisor at the Salt Lake City Department of Economic Development, a position she was appointed in March 2024. It's a point she drives home frequently in her work. While much of the national STEM conversation centers on recruitment, Dr. Enyenihi is focused on what happens after people enter the field: how to keep them there, growing, connected, and fulfilled.

As the Tech Accelerator Awardee for the 2024 Women Tech Awards, Dr. Enyenihi is helping reshape Salt Lake City's tech ecosystem—from workforce development to biotech innovation to early talent cultivation.

A Public Sector Strategist with a Startup Mentality

At the Salt Lake City Department of Economic Development, Dr. Enyenihi leads initiatives designed to close skill gaps in critical sectors including software, biotech, and fintech. That includes launching internship pipelines, workforce-aligned courses, and industry partnerships. One example: a new software course taught by Agile Manifesto co-author Alistair Cockburn, aimed at giving students hands-on skills grounded in industry best practices.

""We’re building from the ground up and looking for what’s missing—not just plugging holes but rethinking the whole structure,"" she said.

Retention Over Recruitment

Dr. Enyenihi’s focus on retention comes from experience. She points to a lack of mentorship, limited mobility, and a lack of diversity as the primary reasons women and underrepresented groups leave STEM fields.

""You can get people in the door, but if they don’t see anyone like them in leadership or don’t have anyone to guide them, they’ll eventually walk away,"" she explains. Her strategy: build inclusive environments where different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives aren’t just welcomed—they’re critical.

From Middle School to Industry

Looking downstream, she’s also thinking about the next generation. Dr. Enyenihi helps lead Human Innovation Day: Exploring Career Paths to Biotechnology, an annual March event supported by the Salt Lake Education Foundation and Mayor Erin Mendenhall's Tech Lake City initiative. The 2025 event will expose middle schoolers to real-world applications of biotech—from sustainable aviation fuel to bioreactors.

""We talk about biotech in three dimensions: to heal the world, feed the world, and fuel the world,"" she says. The goal is early exposure. “If you don’t show students the landscape, how can they navigate it?”

Biotech with Urgency

Before shifting to workforce development, Dr. Enyenihi was in the lab. Her graduate work at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill focused on drug therapies for acute myeloid leukemia, using analytical chemistry to identify anti-cancer targets now being developed into CAR T-cell therapies.

She also helped develop a newborn diagnostic screening for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a genetic disorder often caught too late. “It’s powerful to detect a disease early and change the outcome. But eventually, I wanted to be closer to the people those outcomes affect.”

A Global Journey, A Local Impact

Born in Nigeria and raised in Dominica before immigrating to the U.S. in high school, Dr. Enyenihi is familiar with navigating unfamiliar systems. She taught herself the U.S. education system, learned English, and later studied chemistry at the University of Missouri. She was awarded a McNair Scholars scholarship and pursued research in analytical chemistry, studying abroad in Mexico and Spain to further her Spanish fluency—a skill she still uses in regulatory biotech work.

Her background informs her approach: “You have to know your why,” she says. ""Success for me would mean success for my entire family. That kept me going.""

STEM as a Launchpad

When asked what advice she’d give students entering STEM fields, she doesn’t hesitate: “STEM is your platform. It’s a launch pad. You don’t have to follow someone else’s track—you can make your own.”

Her talks at events like the Intermountain Biological Engineering Conference at Utah State University (November 2024) and Women4STEM at Weber State University (March 2025) don’t shy away from the challenges. “I’m a big proponent of being real. Students deserve the truth so they can make decisions they’ll thrive in.""

Sometimes that truth lands hard: “At one talk, people had tears in their eyes. It wasn’t about success stories—it was about their stories, reflected back at them.”

Whether she’s developing future therapies or future technologists, Dr. Enyenihi is focused on the long game: building systems where people can grow—and stay.

This growth was fueled by revived routes, open-skies agreements, and rising tourism demand.

The Dominican Republic and Brazil set new records in international passenger traffic. The Dominican Republic recorded 1.8 million international travelers—its highest ever for a single month—while Brazil saw notable gains, including a 175% surge in flights between Florianópolis and Buenos Aires. Other highlights include Mexico’s Santa Lucía Airport (up 78%) and Argentina’s Tucumán Airport (up 116%).

ALTA Executive Director José Ricardo Botelho highlighted the industry’s positive outlook, supported by growing connectivity and new routes. However, he noted that high jet fuel costs—US$98.05 per barrel compared to US$208.05 for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—remain a barrier to sustainable fuel adoption, emphasizing the need for supportive policies.

The region also saw strong intraregional growth, particularly on the Lima–Santiago route, now the busiest in Latin America with nearly 156,000 passengers.

Microsoft to co-fund 39,000 tonnes of SAF, cutting 113,000 tonnes of lifecycle emissions — the largest and longest Scope 3 SAF agreement between an airline and corporate customer.

SAF to be sourced from UK’s Phillips 66 and US-based LanzaJet, both using sustainable feedstocks and certified by ISCC.

IAG’s total SAF-related investment surpasses $3.5B, supporting long-term decarbonization of air travel and logistics.

IAG and Microsoft have expanded their 2023 agreement for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), extending it by five years in what is now the most extensive Scope 3 SAF commitment on record between a corporate and an airline.

Under the new terms, Microsoft will co-fund 39,000 additional tonnes of SAF — reducing lifecycle emissions by approximately 113,000 tonnes. Scope 3 includes emissions from activities outside a company’s direct control, such as business travel and freight.

“We are taking our collaboration with IAG further, extending our SAF purchase agreement to bring Microsoft closer to our goal of being carbon negative by 2030, while ensuring a multi-year commitment to help drive greater SAF production,” said Julia Fidler, Environmental Sustainability Fuel and Materials Decarbonization Lead at Microsoft.

“We are pleased to work alongside IAG on efforts to increase demand and make SAF more widely available through our shared long-term purchase agreement.”

This strategic partnership enables Microsoft to decarbonize business travel and global freight while allowing IAG to scale SAF use and reduce its direct (Scope 1) emissions.

The SAF will be produced from:

Used cooking oil and food waste at Phillips 66’s Humberside refinery (UK), and

Sustainably sourced bioethanol at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility (USA), the world’s first commercial-scale alcohol-to-jet fuel plant.

Both production pathways are certified under the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC).

“We’re pleased to work with like-minded organisations such as Microsoft to expand efforts to reduce flying lifecycle emissions,” said Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s Group Sustainability Officer.

“Long-term agreements help encourage much-needed funding in SAF production, something that IAG is championing through our investment in global SAF projects such as LanzaJet.”

The big picture:

Microsoft is also co-funding SAF for air freight used in shipping its global data center components.

IAG’s 2024 SAF usage reached 1.9% of its total fuel, and its total SAF investment (including future commitments) has topped $3.5 billion.

Microsoft’s $1B Climate Innovation Fund has previously invested in LanzaJet, bolstering SAF infrastructure.

According to the Kazakhstan bureau of Report, citing KMG’s press service, the pre-feasibility study stage was successfully completed in 2024. The main feasibility study is now expected to be finalized by the end of 2025.

“During the preparation of the feasibility study, the parties will conduct a thorough analysis of the project, including selecting the optimal region, determining production volumes, and addressing other key factors needed for making a final investment decision,” the statement said.

KMG also noted that three of its refineries have been ready to produce Jet A-1 aviation fuel since 2018. The airport refueling infrastructure is being prepared for a phased transition from the current TC-1 aviation fuel standard to Jet A-1.

“The ambitious project will bring Kazakhstan closer to achieving carbon neutrality as part of its commitments under the Paris Agreement and presents unique opportunities to attract leading international airlines and cargo companies,” the statement added.

This reflects the decarbonisation challenges faced by the sector in comparison to others. At the same time, the aviation industry only looks set to grow with expansions at Heathrow and Gatwick airports expected to be an important part of the UK government’s efforts to stimulate economic growth.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has a critical role to play in enabling the expansion of UK aviation without compromising on environmental protection.

And its importance is recognised by the country’s first-ever SAF mandate coming into law earlier this year. This starts by requiring 2% of the UK’s total jet fuel demand to be SAF this year, with this to then increase linearly to 10% in 2030, and then 22% by 2040. In total, it aims to deliver up to 6.3 megatonnes of carbon savings per year by 2040.

So, the production of SAF will need to scale to deliver against demand. But there are challenges to overcome first. There are already a number of SAF projects underway in the UK, yet complexities in the sector have stifled progress.

The SAF mandate, however, provides fresh impetus for the industry to navigate the challenges holding back the scaling of SAF production, with collaboration at the heart of the solution.

Overcoming barriers

There are several barriers that have stalled the progress of SAF projects in the UK. Chiefly, a lack of certainty around what actually counts as SAF in the UK has held back investment, although the recent mandate serves to rectify this.

One of the key obstacles currently is a concern about the high costs involved with these projects. The advanced technologies and feedstock required for SAF makes it more expensive than traditional jet fuel. This leads to SAF being less competitive, causing airports and airlines to be reluctant to adopt it without incentives.

And when it comes to the feedstock for these projects, those who look to use waste oils, agricultural residues, or dedicated energy crops, are having to grapple with concerns around availability of supply, with the sector being in competition with other sustainable industries like biofuel production.

This means that despite the need for financial resources to scale up production and unlock the significant potential of the industry, investors are cautious.

Helping projects to take off

Despite these barriers, we are seeing ways for businesses to overcome them. Especially amongst smaller schemes, we are seeing innovative technologies emerging to help get the projects we need off the ground.

For instance, flexibly sourcing hydrogen from biomethane or through production by electrolysis is one method that we are seeing to provide an alternative to waste oils, helping to address issues with feedstock availability. Alongside this, there are also process innovations that are now being leveraged to maximise SAF yields, reducing waste and lowering the carbon intensity of the production process.

At Bilfinger UK, we are also involved in various SAF projects as construction partners, helping to reduce risk and drive cost optimisations.

The key to being successful in this has been engaging with stakeholders and subcontractors early, to provide time for detailed discussions and allow for accurate cost estimates. This, alongside building an honest, transparent relationship with clients to foster collaboration, was essential in helping to overcome the uncertainties that we have seen when it comes to SAF.

And we are also seeing efforts from the government to help alleviate investment concerns, with the Advanced Fuels Fund being extended to £63m. There is now a clear push amongst both the public and private sectors to ramp up domestic SAF development.

Scaling SAF

The SAF mandate has fired the starting gun for the sector, but there are still actions that need to be taken to help the sector make the progress it needs and realise its full potential in driving our transition to a greener economy.

In the main, a revenue certainty mechanism still needs to be finalised by the UK government to provide more certainty on the funding and future earnings of projects and prevent developers from being left in limbo.

But once this is implemented, it will then be up to organisations across all levels of the supply chain to engage in the collaboration needed to help our SAF projects take off.",https://www.airport-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2025/04/shutterstock_789771859.jpg,N,,2025-04-07 12:56:55.426288

Geoff Cooper, RFA president, says the initial guidance on 45Z was important for several reasons.
Some members of Congress have already introduced legislation to extend the tax credits another 10 years, while others have called for the repeal of the 45Z tax credit altogether.","The critical pieces of the 45Z tax credit puzzle have been on display for interpretation by the greater biofuels industry and the current administration since early January. At the start of the year, 45Z—designed to award the production of low-emission transportation fuels—was assigned a monetary value by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

The U.S. Department of Energy, for its part, released its GREET model to more accurately calculate carbon intensity (CI) scores of renewable fuels. The USDA released an interim rule on technical guidelines for quantifying, reporting and verifying the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated with the production of corn, sorghum and other biofuel feedstocks, as well as a Feedstock Carbon Intensity Calculator (FD-CIC) to help producers better quantify the true CI values of their efforts.

All these 45Z-related puzzle pieces remain separate components of an incomplete whole, waiting on ongoing comment periods, stalled by government-linked timeline hurdles or the policymaking preferences of the Trump administration. But, as several industry voices have noted, having the pieces on the table now could finally give producers access to proper rewards for their clean fuels, should everything align.

Important Details

Following the release of the 45Z guidance notice and the subsequent updates by the DOE and the USDA on the GREET modeling and USDA FD-CIC, numerous energy accounting, tax and law entities provided their own assessments of the components, primarily basic outlines of the variables that matter to understanding 45Z at the time of the guidance release. Most also note that the guidance is not yet finalized. At press time, there was still no clear timeline as to when the credit framework might be finalized or implemented.

Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, Baker Botts, Latham & Watkins and others all outline several of the same key terms in the guidance.

The term “facility,” is important as it refers to a single production line that is used to produce transportation fuel. The facility can also include carbon capture equipment and components located in a different building or geographic area, provided they function interdependently.

A “producer,” is the person/entity who engages in the production of the transportation fuel and does not need to own the facility. Activities that do not result in chemical transformation wouldn’t qualify as “production.”

“Production,” the tax and law firms point out, begins with the processing of primary feedstocks and ends with ready-to-sell fuel.

A “qualifying sale” involves the sale of a “transportation fuel” for use in the production of a fuel mixture, in trade or business, or sold in retail. “Transportation fuel” is notable because it is defined as “suitable for use as a fuel in a highway vehicle or aircraft.” But actual use as a fuel in a highway vehicle or aircraft would not be required.

A producer would meet the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) requirement if it sells a synthetic blending component that is then blended into an ASTM spec mixture.

Don Lonczak, a tax partner who focuses on energy at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, says the most essential aspect of the guidance is the initial emissions rate table because it sets forth categories of transportation fuels, pathways and feedstocks. Lonczak’s team regularly helps clients with tax credits, including those like the 45Z, to qualify, finance projects or transfer credits.

Key Points

The 45ZCF-GREET model used to create the emissions table that Lonczak cites has long been preferred by the biofuel industry because it uses the most accurate and up-to-date production technology data and does not overstate indirect land-use change in its calculations of CI scores.

In a hearing with the House Committee on Ways and Means in December 2024, roughly one month before the release of the 45Z guidance and subsequent USDA and DOE announcements, members of Growth Energy and the Renewable Fuels Association called for the GREET model to be used in the guidance.

Growth Energy’s CEO, Emily Skor, said the GREET model should specifically be used for emissions calculations because of its treatment of indirect land-use change.

For Jenny Speck, partner at Vinson & Elkins tax practice, the most important piece of the 45Z guidance is multi-pronged. “It provided taxpayers with clarity on eligibility for the credit, the definition of a 45Z facility, and importantly, the potential eligibility of various feedstocks and fuels.”

Vinson & Elkins is already helping clients understand the impact of the 45Z rules on their businesses, Speck says, notably the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, registering to be a clean fuel producer, modifying offtake agreements, selling the 45Z tax credits or strategizing future business plans. And, if 45Z isn’t an option under the current guidance for a producer, Vinson & Elkins can help clients identify other opportunities.

Geoff Cooper, RFA president, says the initial guidance on 45Z was important for several reasons. “We desperately needed to see some structure to the rules surrounding the credits, as well as the 45ZCF-GREET model and the USDA’s FD-CIC feedstock calculator.” The 45ZCF-GREET model release is particularly important, he adds, because the model reflects a big step forward in understanding the emissions benefits of ethanol.

“Emissions from feedstock production contribute to more than half of ethanol’s carbon footprint,” Cooper says.

The model’s release also represents a useful framework for continuing to understand the advancing science and properly valuing the innovation taking place in the industry.

The American Coalition for Ethanol welcomed the USDA’s release of the guidelines and the FD-CIC. ACE has been working for months with government and industry to create a better understanding and system for climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices through programs designed to streamline the process.

Skor notes the importance of the guidance as it relates to investment. She wants the 45Z credit to be extended to 10 years and the Ways and Means Committee to consider putting the SAF credit on par with a previous tax credit known as 40B—roughly $1.25 per gallon as opposed to the 35 cents per gallon credit available to SAF in the Treasury’s 45Z guidance.

Surprises In 45Z

While the guidance from the Treasury, USDA guidelines and DOE release represented a tremendous amount of progress, according to Cooper, many important areas were excluded completely or left undetermined.

Cooper says the Treasury failed to address some feedstocks, including corn kernel fiber, that he and other leaders from industry trade groups called for in the initial January guidance release. The assumption is it will be added later.

In late February, the DOE’s Alternative Fuels Data Center’s numbers showed that the tax credit amount for non-aviation fuel was 20 cents per gallon and 35 cents per gallon for SAF. For facilities that satisfy the wage and apprenticeship requirements, the credit amount would be $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuel and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. The wage and apprenticeship requirements were created in the Biden Administration and call for wage minimums during the construction, alteration or repair of facilities. For the apprenticeship requirements, 15% or more of the labor force working on the construction, alteration or repair of facilities must be from a registered apprenticeship program.

Cooper is already calling for significant revision to the wage and apprenticeship requirements.

“They just aren’t practical for much of the industry,” he says.

Skor is also calling for a re-evaluation of the prevailing wage and apprenticeship components, citing the rural location of most biorefineries and the lack of access to labor in the type and numbers needed to fulfill the requirements.

The January version of the Treasury notice also doesn’t include on-farm practices in CI calculations, Cooper notes.

Speck also points to a lack of guidance on how producers may request provisional emissions rates (PER). She says the issue is especially important because of the limited feedstocks and production pathways in the 45ZCF-GREET model that may leave some in limbo until subsequent guidance on the PER request procedure is published.

Finishing the Puzzle

The comment period on the Treasury’s guidance ended in April. Some members of Congress have already introduced legislation to extend the tax credits another 10 years, while others have called for the repeal of the 45Z tax credit altogether. But leading industry voices have continued to tout the importance of the framework as an economic driver for rural and farm economies, along with the evolution of the SAF industry, regardless of administration.

Cooper says his team will continue to push policymakers to finalize the moving parts, including the Treasury rules, the USDA feedstock rules, the feedstock calculator and the DOE’s 45ZCF-GREET model.

“Getting the emissions pathway rules right will be a big deal,” he says. “This includes making sure technologies are fairly considered and producers are able to get credit for their unique technologies and attributes.”

The RFA also wants to see on-farm practices integrated into emissions calculations. Overall, the industry needs procedures, reporting and compliance requirements that are streamlined and manageable, RFA says.

Growth Energy, ACE, RFA, the Clean Fuels Alliance, the Advanced Biofuels Association and others say more work needs to be done on the final framework of 45Z, but the work is worth doing.

“For the first time ever, you have major federal agencies and a major regulatory framework confirming that indirect land-use change is close to zero and that typical corn ethanol has a carbon intensity below 50 grams per megajoule and cuts GHG emissions by half compared to gasoline,” Cooper says.

Integrating on-farm practices with current ethanol production technology into a CI score has also never been done before.

“We have told our story, and our points are getting through,” Cooper adds. “But I wouldn’t call anything a ‘win’ until we see final guidance that harmonizes the components of the 45Z.”

This new wave of hydrogen-powered projects hopes to decarbonise some of the UK’s most energy-intensive industries and promote economic growth, particularly in manufacturing communities.

These projects promise to cut emissions and create thousands of new jobs, strengthening the government’s ambitions to establish the UK as a global clean energy leader.

27 hydrogen projects selected to drive industrial decarbonisation

The 27 shortlisted projects represent a wide range of industries, from clean power generation to glass manufacturing, brick making, and the production of sustainable aviation fuel.

These initiatives will use low-carbon hydrogen to drive innovation in industries that traditionally contribute to high carbon emissions, positioning hydrogen as a key player in the UK’s transition to net zero. With an estimated £1 billion in private sector investment expected by 2029, this initiative signals a major commitment to climate action and industrial revitalisation.

Hydrogen, produced through a process known as electrolysis, where renewable energy splits water into hydrogen and oxygen, offers a zero-carbon fuel that can power everything from transport and public services to industrial operations.

This method provides a cleaner alternative to traditional energy sources and helps decarbonise industries like ammonia production and power generation, where emissions have been challenging to reduce.

Creating jobs and economic growth

The government’s backing for these projects represents an important moment in the UK’s energy transition, helping establish clean energy hubs across England, Scotland, and Wales.

The projects are expected to boost local economies, particularly in areas that have long been dependent on manufacturing.

New roles will emerge in fields ranging from construction and operations to highly skilled technical jobs, including engineers, welders, and pipefitters. Apprenticeships and graduate positions will also be available, providing a pathway for the next generation to contribute to the UK’s clean energy future.

The UK’s plan towards energy security and local economic resilience

The HAR2 initiative builds on the success of the first Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR1), which saw £2 billion allocated to 11 projects across the UK, bringing green hydrogen into the mainstream. One project, the Whitelee Green Hydrogen facility in Scotland, will produce hydrogen to fuel the Inchdairnie Whiskey distillery, which plans to use clean energy to sustainably distil whisky by 2027.

The funding from HAR1 has already begun to make a lasting impact, with several projects in the early stages of construction and operations.

As part of the Plan for Change, these new hydrogen projects work with the UK government’s goal of achieving energy security and strengthening local economies. In addition to creating jobs, the hydrogen sector offers the potential to build strong supply chains, particularly in regions with a history of industrial activity.

With hydrogen playing an increasing role in the UK’s energy mix, this initiative is set to unlock many economic opportunities and ensure the country’s leadership in clean energy innovation.

These projects are aimed squarely at powering the next generation of clean manufacturing across the nation's industrial strongholds.

The Department for Energy Security and Net-Zero (DESNZ) announced today (7 April) that the Second Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR2) has launched. This competitive program is designed to identify and support hydrogen production facilities that meet the government's strict low-carbon criteria. These shortlisted projects now enter a critical phase where funding is within reach but not guaranteed.

Once a fringe player in clean energy discussions, Hydrogen is gaining momentum. Unlike fossil fuels, hydrogen produces zero emissions at the point of use, making it a strong contender for decarbonising sectors that have historically been hard to electrify — like heavy industry, shipping, and high-heat manufacturing. But there’s a catch: not all hydrogen is created equal.

Globally, a staggering 92% of hydrogen is still “grey”—produced from fossil fuels via steam methane reforming, with significant carbon emissions baked into the process. The UK, however, is drawing a firm line. Only projects producing green hydrogen—generated via electrolysis powered by renewable electricity—are eligible under HAR2. And that’s exactly what all 27 shortlisted projects are offering.

If greenlit, the projects could power a wide range of industries: glassmakers, brick manufacturers, ammonia producers, and even those working on sustainable aviation fuels. The broader aim? To inject low-carbon hydrogen directly into industrial operations, slashing emissions where they matter most—at the source.

Among the industries expected to benefit are those with high-temperature processes that are notoriously difficult to decarbonise through electrification alone. In this context, hydrogen becomes a clean energy solution and a strategic enabler for the UK's climate and economic goals.

This isn’t the first time the UK has rolled the dice on hydrogen. Under HAR1, launched by then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, 11 projects were awarded £90 million in capital grants and over £2 billion in revenue support, unlocking a combined 124 megawatts (MW) of hydrogen production capacity. So far, five of those have inked their final contracts, including flagship efforts like the Bradford Low Carbon Project in Yorkshire and the Cromarty Hydrogen Project in Scotland.

But history also offers a cautionary tale. Being shortlisted does not guarantee funding. As with HAR1, many current HAR2 hopefuls will likely fall short. Developers must now provide updated technical and financial information and continue to refine their proposals if they hope to secure a slice of the funding pie.

The UK’s target of 10GW of low-carbon hydrogen production by 2030 remains a central plank of the national climate strategy. Although initially set under Conservative leadership, the Labour-led government has embraced the mission with its own twist, claiming the hydrogen sector could unlock over £1 billion in private investment by 2029.

Industry Minister Sarah Jones said: “We are deploying hydrogen at a commercial scale for the first time – not just investing in a technology – but investing in British jobs, our proud manufacturing communities and our energy security.

“From distilleries and sustainable aviation fuel to public transport and clean energy

generation, hydrogen can power our everyday life and unlock clean energy growth across the country as part of our Plan for Change.”

What’s clear is this: the race to scale green hydrogen is officially on. With HAR2’s shortlist now public, the country’s industrial future may well depend on which of these 27 projects makes the final cut.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_4814b5e52b5344398f6eda7304eef038~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_960,h_640,al_c,q_85/becc64_4814b5e52b5344398f6eda7304eef038~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-04-07 12:57:14.484914

Live now, the Registry is meant to facilitate the development of an international SAF market, which is expected to accelerate aviation's path to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Ensuring Transparency and Preventing Double Counting

The new SAF Registry will serve as a secure, transparent platform to document the environmental credentials of SAF transactions. By providing an immutable record of SAF purchases, the Registry will prevent double counting and ensure that airlines worldwide can verify their SAF use for climate compliance.

In addition to airlines, corporate clients, fuel manufacturers, regulators, and related entities will be able to log and monitor SAF transactions within this global system.

Marie Owens Thomsen, the Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist at IATA, stated that aviation's decarbonization is a collaborative effort. She explained that the release of the SAF Registry to CADO for launch is a crucial platform that benefits all stakeholders. It ensures that airlines worldwide have access to SAF, and their SAF purchases can be claimed against climate-related obligations.

The Registry will securely record the environmental attributes of SAF purchases, preventing double counting. She emphasized that airlines, corporate customers, fuel producers, regulatory bodies, and related organizations will be able to record and account for SAF transactions in a global market.

While acknowledging the significance of this advancement, Thomsen noted that the Registry is just one step toward establishing a mature, transparent, and liquid global SAF market. She further pointed out that the Registry alone cannot produce miracles, but without it, no progress can be made.

Thomsen stressed that further progress requires active policy support to ramp up renewable energy production, including SAF. She called for governments to reallocate support previously given to fossil fuel producers in favor of renewable energy production. Drawing from the precedents set by the wind and solar energy markets, she urged that this transition should happen without delay.",https://prod-sen-news.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/67f3d08685f22f89e4c881e9.png,N,,2025-04-07 15:56:10.830238

As such, the Airbus A321ceo looks set to serve Delta Air Lines for the foreseeable future.
Operational snapshot According to current fleet data made available by aeroLOPA, Delta Air Lines configures its Airbus A321ceo aircraft in a 191-seat layout that features two classes of travel.
Looking at present scheduling data from Cirium, we can see that Delta Air Lines favors domestic operations when it comes to its first-generation Airbus A321-200 jets from the A320ceo family.
Domestically speaking, Delta Air Lines has scheduled a whopping 13,613 flights within the United States of America with its Airbus A321 jets this month.","When it comes to the pollution emitted by modern aviation operations, a heavy emphasis is placed on carbon emissions, with airlines around the world looking to get these down to a net-zero level by 2050. However, this isn't the only kind of pollution that operators of commercial aircraft have to take into consideration. Indeed, noise pollution also plays a key role in dictating decision-making processes.

Of course, this is far from a new issue. Indeed, Concorde faced considerable opposition in the US in its early years on account of the noise emitted by its sonic booms, and airports like London Heathrow (LHR) have been using runway alteration schemes for a long time in order to minimize the impact on local residents. This is also something that Delta Air Lines has been able to work on in recent years, thanks to a small but effective addition to the engines on its Airbus A321ceo twinjets.

Older engines

In recent years, airlines around the world have modernized their portfolios of Airbus narrowbodies by adding planes from the A320neo family. Powered by CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1100G turbofan engines, these modern single-aisle twinjets are known for being quieter than their predecessors, both in terms of noise inside the cabin and how loud they are to onlookers outside the jet.

Want answers to more key questions in aviation? Check out the rest of our guides here!

However, this isn't a feature of older twinjets from the A320ceo series, as these are fitted with previous-generation engines. These include the likes of the CFM International CFM56-5B (all models), the Pratt & Whitney PW6000A (A318 only), and the International Aero Engines IAE V2500 (everything but the A318). As such, long-term operators of such jets are faced with considerably higher noise emissions.

Delta Air Lines is one such carrier, as its Airbus A321-200s from the A320ceo series, in particular, are still on the relatively young side. Indeed, present fleet data made available by ch-aviation shows that these aircraft have an average age of just 6.3 years old, compared to 23.2 years for its A319-100s and 29 years for its A320-200s. In fact, Delta made history by receiving the last ever A321ceo in 2021.

As such, the Airbus A321ceo looks set to serve Delta Air Lines for the foreseeable future. However, it will do so alongside an increasingly large fleet of next-generation A321neo aircraft, with the carrier set to operate more than 150 once all orders are delivered. With this in mind, Delta (alongside certain other A321 operators) has a trick up its sleeve to bridge the gap in terms of noise pollution on its A321 jets.

Special chevrons

For eagle-eyed viewers, the small but effective alteration that makes Delta Air Lines' Airbus A321s quieter than most can briefly be seen in the video embedded below, which shows the carrier's first A321 taking off and landing at Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport (XFW) in Germany. Specifically, the exhaust nozzles at the rear end of its jet engines are fitted with tooth-like chevron structures to reduce their noise.

This modification is only available on aircraft powered by CFM International CFM56 engines, with the company announcing that it was working on such technology as early as February 2002. Indeed, a statement published on the General Electric Aerospace website at the time explained that ""the new technology includes (...) a core chevron nozzle. (...) Flight tests on the Airbus A321 are scheduled for later this year, followed by certification and entry into service in early 2003.""

The chevrons represented part of a wider acoustic package that aimed to ""reduce the cumulative noise signature at least 10 EPNdB (effective perceived noise in decibels) below Stage III levels."" As it happened, a later statement made by CFM International itself confirmed that flight testing of the upgrade package on Airbus planes would actually be able to begin slightly earlier, namely in November of 2002.

As pictured in the photo embedded above, Delta is not the only carrier to have reaped the rewards of this technology. Indeed, Aeroflot was among the other airlines whose CFM56-powered A321ceos were also fitted with noise-reducing chevrons on the exhaust nozzles of their engines. According to Aerospace Research Central, studies found that the chevrons alone reduced perceived noise levels by 1.3 decibels during takeoff, a flight stage when engines are typically at their loudest.

Meeting regulations

While any kind of progress in terms of pollution reduction in modern commercial aviation represents a positive step forward, there was a good reason for the addition of chevrons to the exhaust nozzles of the CFM International CFM56 engines used on the Airbus A321. Indeed, as the company explained in 2002, the ""CFM56-5B engine for the higher-gross-weight A321"" was soon set to face regulatory issues.

CFM International explained that ""noise and emissions have become key factors in aircraft fleet planning and operations, [and] all CFM-powered A320 family aircraft meet current FAR Stage III noise requirements with a significant margin."" However, a few years down the line, a new set of aviation regulations concerning noise pollution emitted by commercial aircraft, known as CAEP 5, was set to come into force. The A321's incompatibility with these prompted the modifications, as CFM notes:

""These [CFM International CFM56] engines also meet the CAEP 5 recommendations, which take effect on January 1st, 2006, with the exception of the CFM56-5B engine for the higher-gross-weight A321. CFM and Airbus have defined an acoustic package to ensure this aircraft/engine combination will operate well within the proposed limits.""

Over the years, there have been slight concerns in certain corners that the addition of chevrons to turbofans, as also seen on the engine covers of certain next-generation Boeing aircraft, may hinder the performance of these planes due to vortex-induced drag. However, according to the Aviation Stack Exchange, research into this subject in 2000 by NASA found that the thrust reduction was minimal.

Delta's A321 fleet in a nutshell

As mentioned earlier, Delta Air Lines' current sub-fleet of Airbus A321 twinjets is relatively young, with an average age of just 6.3 years old at the time of writing (compared to a fleet-wide mean figure of 16 years). According to ch-aviation, all of these aircraft are fitted with CFM International engines, with the aforementioned chevrons on the exhaust nozzles playing a key role in noise reduction.

All in all, Delta currently has 127 examples of the Airbus A321-200 at its disposal, of which 123 are presently listed as being active, with the remaining four undergoing maintenance procedures at the time of writing. This sub-fleet of 127 aircraft makes the A321ceo Delta Air Lines' second most numerous aircraft type and its most popular Airbus jet, with its total only exceeded by the Boeing 737-900ER (163 units).

While the Airbus A321 first flew in March of 1993, and entered service the following January with German flag carrier and Star Alliance founding member Lufthansa , it wasn't until more than two decades later that Delta Air Lines received its first example of the type. Indeed, March 2016 saw N301DV join the SkyTeam founding member on a brand-new basis, with deliveries of the carrier's 127 Airbus A321 aircraft continuing until N129DN came onboard in December of 2021.

Delta has also used the A321 for various special milestones, such as a flight from Minneapolis St Paul International Airport (MSP) to New York LaGuardia (LGA) in September of 2024 that was powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Needless to say, despite Delta having already received 71 next-generation Airbus A321neos and with orders for another 84, the older A321ceo isn't going anywhere just yet.

Operational snapshot

According to current fleet data made available by aeroLOPA, Delta Air Lines configures its Airbus A321ceo aircraft in a 191-seat layout that features two classes of travel. The best seats in the house are the 20 domestic first class recliners, which are laid out in five four-abreast (2-2) rows and offer 37 inches of pitch. Meanwhile, of the 171 economy seats, 29 are listed as Delta Comfort+ with an increased pitch of 34 inches, compared to the 31 inches that are offered in standard economy seats.

Looking at present scheduling data from Cirium, we can see that Delta Air Lines favors domestic operations when it comes to its first-generation Airbus A321-200 jets from the A320ceo family. Indeed, this April, the Atlanta-based carrier has scheduled just 619 flights to and from foreign destinations with the stretched-fuselage narrowbody twinjet. The top route on this front connects its Atlanta (ATL) hub with Cancun (CUN) in Mexico, offering 78 monthly rotations. Others include:

Detroit (DTW) - Cancun, 64 round trips.

Atlanta - Montego Bay (MBJ), 36 round trips.

Minneapolis - Cancun, 33 round trips.

Domestically speaking, Delta Air Lines has scheduled a whopping 13,613 flights within the United States of America with its Airbus A321 jets this month. These services will offer collective grand totals of 2,600,083 seats and 2,838,176,533 available seat miles (ASMs). The type's busiest internal route at Delta this month is from Atlanta to New York LaGuardia, with 402 outbound and 403 inbound flights scheduled. Meanwhile, Atlanta to West Palm Beach (PBI) has 338 round trips.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/here-s-why-delta-air-lines-airbus-a321s-are-quieter-than-others-16x9.jpg,N,,2025-04-07 11:57:21.370230

The 27 shortlisted projects reportedly represent 765MW of production capacity, although 23% of the selected initiatives have yet to disclose their planned electrolyser sizes.
Nevertheless, it is expected to provide revenue support through the Hydrogen Production Business Model (HPBM) over 15-year contracts, similar to HAR1.
Additionally, the projects selected under HAR1 ultimately secured less funding than the total available allocation.
At the Hydrogen UK Annual Conference in Birmingham last week (April 2), Industry Minister Sarah Jones confirmed that the remaining eight HAR1 contracts will be finalised by May.","The UK Government has shortlisted 27 successful projects under its Hydrogen Allocation Round 2 (HAR2), expected to deliver a combined 765MW of low-carbon hydrogen production capacity for deployment between 2026 and 2029.

The projects, which include initiatives from RWE, Uniper and Centrica, among others, are expected to supply hydrogen for the power, glass manufacturing, brick-making and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sectors.

The 27 shortlisted projects reportedly represent 765MW of production capacity, although 23% of the selected initiatives have yet to disclose their planned electrolyser sizes. HAR2 was originally planned to support 875MW.

Geographically, the shortlist spans the UK, with Scotland standing out – home to eight of the 27 projects. Among those with published capacity data, Scottish projects account for 35% of the total 765MW.

However, in an online statement, the government stressed that it’s “unlikely that all projects will be successful.” It added, “As such being on the shortlist does not imply availability of funding for any of the shortlisted projects.”

In terms of developers, RWE leads the pack, responsible for 41% of the disclosed capacity, driven primarily by its 200MW Grangemouth Green Hydrogen project and 100MW Pembroke Green Hydrogen initiative. Uniper and Green Cat Hydrogen follow, contributing 14% and 9% of the total, respectively.

French hydrogen producer Lhyfe will deliver 100MW of combined capacity via its North Tyneside and Kent projects. Boris Davis, Head of Business Development UK at Lhyfe, said he will work with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) to “progress at pace to the next stage and ultimately get the production sites up and running.”

Clare Jackson, CEO of Hydrogen UK, claimed HAR2 “builds on valuable lessons from past rounds and strengthens UK leadership in clean energy.”

The exact total funding amount for HAR2 has not been specified. Nevertheless, it is expected to provide revenue support through the Hydrogen Production Business Model (HPBM) over 15-year contracts, similar to HAR1.

The eventual winners will receive public financial support in the form of a Contract for Difference (CfD), a mechanism guaranteeing them in the long-term a fixed price for the hydrogen produced.

In December 2023, the government announced £2bn ($2.6bn) in funding for 11 hydrogen projects for HAR1, offering a combined capacity of 125MW – although delays in critical agreements left them in limbo for a year.

By December 2024, three projects totalling 31.8MW of capacity officially signed agreements for government revenue support.

Additionally, the projects selected under HAR1 ultimately secured less funding than the total available allocation.

The question now is whether tariffs will hurt oil demand for longer or whether the effect will be transitory, with prices rebounding before long.

For now, a majority of observers appear to agree that the tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump imposed on all of the country’s trade partners would hurt oil demand quite seriously and continue hurting it for their duration.

The International Monetary Fund came out with a statement this, in which its chief, Kristalina Georgieva, said the tariffs were a threat to global economic growth. “We are still assessing the macroeconomic implications of the announced tariff measures, but they clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of sluggish growth,” she said, adding, “We appeal to the United States and its trading partners to work constructively to resolve trade tensions and reduce uncertainty.”

It is this argument of damage to economic growth that most analysts are pointing to when predicting dark times ahead for oil prices. As Gabelli Funds analyst Simon Wong puts it, while direct tariffs on crude are not “very meaningful”, “The bigger impact on the oil market is the uncertainty in global demand related to President Trump’s tariffs as global expansion drives crude demand growth.”

Indeed, Bloomberg’s Julian Lee wrote in a column Thursday that even though oil itself was mostly spared from tariff pressure, demand for it was bound to be hurt because the biggest driver of demand was Asia, and Trump slapped Asian countries with some of the highest additional tariffs. Lee sees an economic slowdown in Asia resulting from the tariffs that would inevitably lead to lower oil demand that may last a while.

However, there is a counterargument to be made. The tariffs have tanked oil prices. This means oil is now more affordable for Asian importers. It is an interesting question whether they would miss out on a chance to replenish their stocks of crude—especially in anticipation of an inevitable economic slowdown—or grab it and buy more oil on the cheap.

There is also the question of how long these tariffs will remain in effect. Per Trump’s Vice President, J.D. Vance, the point of these is to bring back manufacturing home. “That's fundamentally what this is about, the national security of manufacturing and making the things that we need, from steel to pharmaceuticals,” Vance told media, as quoted by Reuters.

Not everyone sees it that way, to put it mildly. According to Henry Hoffman, PM of the Catalyst Energy Infrastructure Fund, “The Trump administration's decision to base them on a net-imports-to-imports ratio seems less about reciprocity or fairness and more about wielding a blunt instrument to force negotiating leverage. In doing so, the White House is giving up the moral high ground it often claims in trade talks, opting instead for a high-risk, high-reward gambit.”

This is why the tariffs are unlikely to become a permanent fixture of global trade, hurting growth prospects and sinking oil prices lower. “It’s hard to imagine these tariffs sticking for the long term. They seem engineered more as a provocation—a splashy opening move in a game of tit-for-tat brinksmanship aimed at fast-tracking trade concessions,” Hoffman says, cautioning, however, that they may yet backfire. If that happens, it would hurt emerging, smaller economies the most.

Bad as this is, it means that the biggest oil consumers will remain relatively unscathed. China, which is always the focus of analyst attention when it comes to oil, is already preparing its response to the tariffs—and it’s going to be about stimulus and export market diversification. CNBC cited several analysts from China as expecting a focus on local economic strengthening action instead of retaliatory tariffs, which somewhat ironically suggests the “blunt instrument” may end up benefiting its target. It’s worth noting—as analysts have done—that China has a growth target to reach, and for that, it needs energy, in other words, oil and gas.

China is unlikely to be the only one diversifying export markets and forging or strengthening trade relationships with countries other than the United States—if the tariffs stay. If commentators see them as a blunt instrument for trade negotiations, like Catalyst Energy Infrastructure Fund’s Hoffman, they will be removed soon enough as long as the target countries commit to “fixing” their surpluses with the United States. It might yet turn out to be a molehill instead of a mountain.

Of course, there is always the possibility that the tariffs will remain in place for more than a couple of weeks, which will really set in motion those processes of diversification and trade relationship building. Like the sanctions on Russia, however, tariffs will, in all likelihood, change patterns in the global oil market but not really kill oil demand, regardless of the short-term effect of the tariffs on economic growth prospects.

We’ll take a look at the week ahead and look back on what you may have missed last week.

LEE ZELDIN’S AMBITIOUS EVOLUTION — POLITICO’s Hannah Northey, Emily Ngo, Josh Siegel and Miranda Wilson: President Donald Trump’s wild-card pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency has emerged as one of the most devoted public champions for his efforts to demolish the Biden agenda — and MAGA world is taking notice.

Lee Zeldin’s crusade to revoke more than $20 billion in already-doled-out climate grants has taken the EPA into uncharted legal territory, provoked a spat inside the Justice Department and left some environmental nonprofits fearing possible bankruptcy. He’s made dozens of appearances on conservative television outlets such as Fox News, Fox Business and Newsmax — proclaiming the “death of the green new scam” on Laura Ingraham’s primetime show — while using his own videos on X and EPA’s YouTube channel to call for rolling back “suffocating” regulations and defanging the “climate change religion.”

Zeldin has also praised Elon Musk and embraced Trump’s call for slashing 65 percent from his own agency’s budget, a target that he insists will cut waste, bring back auto jobs and boost U.S. energy dominance. The Sierra Club has denounced the proposed cuts as “sabotage.”

The Army reservist and former House member’s performance as Trump’s environmental enforcer is winning cheers from the president’s supporters, according to interviews with a dozen of Zeldin’s former colleagues, political opponents and local officials in and around his home community of Long Island. This comes a little more than two years after Zeldin’s aggressive, crime-focused campaign for governor in deep-blue New York came surprisingly close to unseating Democrat Kathy Hochul — an outcome that caused fellow Republicans to predict a bright future for him in GOP politics, possibly as national or state party chair.

Now the question is what doors a role in Trump’s Cabinet might be opening — or closing — for Zeldin.

“If he can do a good job and continue on the path that he’s on, then there’ll be all kinds of different potential options open to him,” said Andrew Giuliani, who ran against Zeldin in the 2022 GOP primary for governor and is son of the former New York City mayor-turned-Trump-attorney.

LIHEAP WORRIES — New Jersey officials are worried about layoffs at the federal program that helps low-income people keep their lights on and heat and cool their homes.

So far, Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration has been unable to get much information about how the layoffs at the federal health department’s Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program will affect the 240,000 or so households that receive several hundreds of dollars a year to help pay their gas and electric bills. Hundreds of thousands more homes are likely eligible but don’t participate.

“They have fired all the employees who actually implement the program,” said state ratepayer watchdog Brian Lipman. “I haven’t seen anything about cutting the program, but I’m not sure how you have a program if you don’t have anyone who can actually run the program.”

The worry is especially acute because energy bills in New Jersey continue to rise. Power bills are expected to go up by $25 a month starting in June.

Concern about LIHEAP has been widespread among Democrats since the cuts were first reported last week. — Ry Rivard

TRUMP ADMIN FLOATS LONG ISLAND GAS PLANT FOR AI: The U.S. Department of Energy wants input on a proposal to power a data center at the Brookhaven National Laboratory with a new Long Island gas plant. The DOE floated a 90-acre data center site at Brookhaven in a request for information released Thursday. The department wants to leverage its land to support American leadership in artificial intelligence, according to the RFI. A new data center at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Discovery Park could be powered by a new 750 megawatt gas plant on the property of the existing 350 megawatt Caithness plant, the document suggests.

The DOE is targeting projects that could begin construction this year and be operational by 2027. That’s an ambitious timeline to build a new gas plant in New York, where Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected new permits for gas plants in 2021 due to the state’s climate law. Caithness proposed an expansion more than a decade ago but ultimately didn’t move forward after the Long Island Power Authority later found it wasn’t needed. The power plant company did not respond to a request for comment. The company is also considering battery storage for the site, Newsday reported last month.

The proposal to build a second, larger gas plant comes as environmental groups are challenging DEC’s approval of an air permit for the existing Caithness gas plant. Earthjustice is representing progressive groups opposed to the pollution from the power plant, which is contracted with the Long Island Power Authority until 2029. They argue that DEC should have applied stricter scrutiny to the renewed permit to comply with the state’s 2019 climate law. — Marie J. French

LAWMAKERS DEFEND CLEAN TRUCK RULES: Supporters of a mandate to sell increasing amounts of electric trucks banded together to oppose a bill to delay the rules. “When it comes to environmental protections, the storyline is always the same — polluters drag their feet and say they can’t possibly meet the standards, they need a couple more years,” said Democratic Sen. Liz Krueger, chair of the Senate Finance Committee. “Then in a couple years, they act surprised when the deadline is approaching, and say they need a few more.” Sens. Julia Salazar, Nathalia Fernandez and Brad Hoylman-Sigal also expressed opposition to any delay. Assemblymembers Karines Reyes, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, Khaleel Anderson, Emily Gallagher, Al Stirpe and Amanda Septimo also joined in. The delay of the advanced clean trucks rule is sponsored by Democratic Sen. Jeremy Cooney and Assemblymember Donna Lupardo. — Marie J. French

TO THE CAPITOL — Infrastructure tweaks could dramatically cut commute times between New York City and Albany, according to a new study by longtime transit reporter Nolan Hicks.

Hicks explored basic changes to trains and stations that could trim trip times in his work for NYU’s Marron Institute of Urban Management.

First, make sure the platforms are level with trains. That cuts the time a train must wait at a station because people with luggage and strollers can walk on and off the train without climbing steps.

Second, switch from diesel to electric train engines for better acceleration and speed.

The bottom line: It would cost about $3.5 billion to slash a trip from the city to the capital by more than half an hour. “Trains could sprint between New York City and Albany,” Hicks writes, “depending on the level of investment.”

Right now the trip can take 2 hours and 41 minutes; Hicks said these improvements could reduce that to about 2 hours.

Similar changes could reduce a trip between the city and Buffalo by nearly three hours, the report said. — Ry Rivard

CAMDEN FIRE — POLITICO’s Matt Friedman: A recycling company whose Camden facility had a massive fire in February that scared and temporarily displaced residents has inspired legislation that would require companies to give back their tax incentives if found to have violated New Jersey environmental laws. New Jersey awarded EMR $253 million in tax incentives in 2015 to build the facility in New Jersey’s most impoverished city with the aim of creating jobs, though it was reduced by nearly half, to $132 million, in 2022.

The proposal, NJ A5534 (24R), by Assemblymember Bill Moen, a Democrat who represents Camden, would require any business that receives a state economic development subsidy and is found to have violated state environmental laws to forfeit at least 20 percent of its incentives, and more if that’s not enough to cover the cost of the incident. The bill, though inspired by EMR’s fire, would likely not apply to it, as it would only apply to incentive agreements between companies and the state that were struck after its effective date.

NYSERDA EYES ALTERNATIVE FUELS: Gov. Kathy Hochul’s administration is seeking industry and stakeholder input as it develops a funding program for in-state fuel production from waste like cow manure, landfills, paper plants, wastewater treatment plants and other sources. NYSERDA released a “request for information” to shape a planned competitive program for pilot projects, research and development, and supply chain development for alternative fuels from waste feed stocks including renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, sustainable aviation fuel and clean hydrogen. Responses are sought by May 30.

It’s the latest sign of interest from Hochul’s energy policy experts in an “all-of-the-above” approach to reducing emissions and achieving the state’s climate goals. NYSERDA’s focus in the request is on using clean fuels in the transportation sector, which aligns with elements of the state’s climate scoping plan. The plan called for the state to “evaluate and consider adopting” a low-carbon fuel standard for the transportation sector, which would promote biofuels and electrification by raising the cost for fossil fuels. Hochul in her 2024 State of the State directed state agencies to launch that study. No results have been released, but NYSERDA and DEC are working with ICF on it, a spokesperson told POLITICO in January 2025.

Dairy farms and landfills in New York are already producing pipeline-grade renewable natural gas, but the environmental benefits are largely being sold in California and elsewhere since there’s little market for the fuel in New York. “New York dairy farms implement science-based management practices daily to protect our natural resources, and it’s encouraging to see NYSERDA and lawmakers considering ways our farms can continue to recycle materials, reduce emissions, and contribute to the state’s climate goals,” said Allyson Jones-Brimmer, vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs with the Northeast Dairy Producers Association.

Environmental justice groups have opposed widespread adoption and promotion of biofuels, as they’d still emit health-harming co-pollutants. They prefer a strict focus on electrification efforts to eliminate those pollutants in their communities. “NYSERDA should invest in giving New Yorkers access to clean, energy-efficient technologies that we know work well, like heat pumps and electric vehicles, rather than chasing dirty false solutions that will continue to pollute New York communities,” said Hillary Aidun, senior associate attorney with Earthjustice.

The New York League of Conservation Voters and other supporters of the clean fuel standard concept argue diesel trucks will remain on the road for years to come and fuel switching will reduce emissions in the near term. Fuel suppliers who have advocated for biofuels to be included in the state’s emissions reduction efforts praised NYSERDA’s request for information as a positive sign. “Biofuels, including renewable diesel, should be a critical component of an all-of-the-above approach to meeting New York’s energy and emissions goals,” said New York State Energy Coalition CEO Rocco J. Lacertosa and Empire State Energy Association Executive Director Kris DeLair in a joint statement. “The state is taking important steps to make an impact today and lead innovation that drives progress in the years ahead.” — Marie J. French

MIND THE FUNDING GAP: One of the asks from environmental groups and lawmakers as budget negotiations officially enter overtime is for a program to address issues preventing low- and moderate-income households from accessing energy efficiency and other decarbonization programs. Dubbed the “Green Affordable Pre-Electrification,” or GAP Fund, lawmakers and environmental advocates called for $200 million for the program to remediate at least 10,000 homes annually. A report funded by WE ACT 4 Change last month estimated that between 550,000 and 1 million low- and moderate-income households need structural improvements or other upgrades before being able to access weatherization or electrification programs. The Fiscal Policy Institute placed the total need for funding at $11 billion.

The Assembly included money for this concept in its one-house budget with specifics for the $1 billion proposed by Hochul. The Senate included the legislation (S3315/A2101) in its one-house budget. It’s just one of many specific programs environmental groups are pushing to get funded that may end up getting a boost from Hochul’s $1 billion “Sustainable Future Fund.” Other asks have included funding for electric school buses as concerns about a mandate for new purchases rise and thermal energy network projects for college campuses.

“It’s time to fill this gap,” said Assemblymember Didi Barrett, chair of the Energy Committee. “We do have some great programs in New York but in order to make them accessible for low- and moderate-income families we have to make sure they can do the things they need to do to access these sustainability programs.” Barrett called on Hochul to support the proposal. — Marie J. French

RELIABILITY IN FOCUS: The New York Post zeroed in on reliability issues highlighted in a recent analysis that backers intended to underscore their opposition to letting utilities build new renewables. “A bombshell report from a clean energy group admitted that shifting to solar and wind may mean chaos for New York’s power grid as the state’s green energy law creates hurdles for cost and reliability,” the Post’s Carl Campanile wrote about the FTI Consulting report on utility-owned generation.

The FTI report includes a disclaimer that it does not necessarily represent the views of backers including the Alliance for Clean Energy, Independent Power Producers of New York, Inc., solar trade groups and others. The report cites the state’s independent grid operator and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which sets reliability standards, raising concerns about the slow progress of renewables and retirement of fossil fuel plants as demand for power expands. “New York faces hurdles in maintaining reliability due to ambitious renewables targets, the projected retirement of much of its flexible fossil generation fleet, growing load, and extreme weather,” the report states.

“The point of the Report and its findings were to demonstrate the increased costs associated with utility projects versus [independent power generators], amongst other issues,” said Gavin Donohue, the head of IPPNY. The findings were presented at IPPNY’s conference in Albany last week. They mainly focused on the cost declines for electricity supply in New York since utilities were largely barred from owning generation assets. The report concluded that utilities would face all the same issues slowing renewable development in New York that private developers have. The industry was concerned because utility ownership was floated in the state’s draft report on progress toward the 70 percent renewable by 2030 target, which New York will not meet. That report includes several actions to continue investing in new renewables and speed up progress despite the delay — a final version is expected this month.

The New York Post “mischaracterized” the report, said Marguerite Wells, head of ACE New York. “To completely change how our grid works and all the generation on it brings a lot of challenges,” she said. “What we were really calling out was that utility ownership of renewables would make it more expensive for ratepayers. The challenges, which we’ve acknowledged, are not new news.. and we’re working on solutions.”

The report also highlights delays by the state’s Public Service Commission in defining “zero emission” resources that would support the achieving of the 2040 zero emissions electric grid target in the climate law. The state’s own analysis, independent researchers and the New York Independent System Operator has concluded there will need to be thousands of megawatts of new, dispatchable, zero-emissions resources to meet that target and maintain reliability. Wind, existing nuclear and hydropower, solar and current battery technology won’t be sufficient, according to those reports. But it’s not clear what that technology will be or how the state will promote development.

Gov. Kathy Hochul has in the past year focused on the potential of new nuclear to support a decarbonized grid. She rejected a proposal to build new gas plants in New York City in 2021 that developers argued would support grid reliability and reduce overall emissions. The state issued regulations to retire some of the oldest, most polluting fossil fuel power plants, in 2019. But those rules included provisions to keep the plants available if needed — and some are staying online after the NYISO identified problems meeting peak summer demand this year if they retire.

There are off-ramps elsewhere. The climate law allows the PSC to modify the state’s electricity targets if they threaten reliability or are linked to more unpaid utility bills. The New York Power Authority is required to retire its small downstate fossil fuel power plants by 2030, but can delay if retirements risk reliability or would raise emissions from other power plants near vulnerable communities.

“The governor has led by example in New York’s ongoing transition to a clean energy economy: we have one of the cleanest grids in the nation — with 50% zero-emission electricity — and are a gold standard in reliability,” Hochul spokesperson Paul DeMichele told the New York Post. “The governor recognizes that we can only continue to serve as that good example if the lights stay on and costs are low — and she will use every tool at her disposal to ensure that happens.” — Marie J. French

CLIMATE LAWSUIT FILED — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: Green groups are suing in state court to force Gov. Kathy Hochul’s administration to implement New York’s landmark climate law. Four environmental groups filed a lawsuit Monday that claims the Department of Environmental Conservation is violating the climate law by failing to adopt regulations to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The lawsuit alleges the DEC is also running afoul of the state constitutional right to clean air and a healthy environment.

“DEC’s failure to comply with its mandatory duty to regulate threatens New York’s climate targets as well as New Yorkers’ health and wellbeing,” the lawsuit states.

Hochul has delayed the rollout of the cap-and-trade style program she first embraced during her State of the State speech in 2023. The governor has since been more focused on the potential cost concerns and economic impacts of her signature program to abide by the state’s climate law.",https://static.politico.com/3d/ee/f4d549cf4e548af6712990ce5b9e/politico-cms-shared-graphic-1120x629.jpg,N,,2025-04-07 10:56:08.810179

The partnership includes the long-term lease of eight Airbus A320neo aircraft, designed to support the airline’s continued expansion and sustainability goals.

As part of the agreement, two of the aircraft have already been delivered, while the remaining six are scheduled for delivery throughout 2025. The deal strengthens the relationship between AviLease and Turkish Airlines, one of the world’s fastest-growing carriers, as it enhances its narrow-body operations with next-generation, fuel-efficient aircraft.

The Airbus A320neo is known for its reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions, making it a key component in Turkish Airlines’ broader fleet modernization strategy. The airline has made sustainability a core focus of its operations, and adding these aircraft contributes directly to that mission while also boosting its ability to serve short- and medium-haul routes more efficiently.

Edward O’Byrne, Chief Executive Officer of AviLease, stated, “We thank the Turkish Airlines team for their partnership, and we are delighted to further strengthen our relationship. These aircraft will support Turkish Airlines’ growth plans while contributing to their fleet modernisation strategy and sustainability goals.”

AviLease’s Growing Presence in Global Aviation

With this agreement, AviLease continues its rapid ascent as a major player in global aircraft leasing. Backed by the long-term capital of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), AviLease has positioned itself as a strategic asset under the kingdom’s Vision 2030 initiative. The lessor currently owns and manages a portfolio of 200 aircraft—primarily new-technology, fuel-efficient models—leased to 48 airlines around the world.

Founded to align with Saudi Arabia’s National Aviation Strategy, AviLease operates globally with a team of 85 aviation professionals across five offices. Its aim is not only to be a top-10 global aircraft lessor but also to drive innovation and sustainability within the aviation finance sector. The Turkish Airlines partnership demonstrates how AviLease is leveraging its capital and expertise to form long-term relationships with leading global carriers.

The A320neo aircraft included in the agreement are particularly well-suited for Turkish Airlines’ needs. Offering lower operational costs and increased range compared to earlier models, these jets help airlines reduce their environmental footprint while maintaining strong performance on busy regional routes.

This move comes at a time when global airlines are increasingly focused on fleet renewal to meet tightening environmental regulations and rising fuel costs. Turkish Airlines’ decision to lease from AviLease rather than purchase the aircraft outright reflects a broader trend toward financial flexibility and capital efficiency in airline operations.

For AviLease, deals like this one with Turkish Airlines mark important milestones in building a globally diversified client base. The lessor’s expanding portfolio and growing list of partner airlines signal its role as a key enabler of aviation growth, especially for airlines seeking modern fleets to support ambitious expansion strategies.

As both companies continue to pursue growth and innovation, this agreement reflects a shared vision for the future of air travel—one that is sustainable, efficient, and globally connected.",https://ftnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/avilease-turkish-airlines-a320neo-lease-agreement-group-photo.webp,N,,2025-04-07 10:56:12.638259

Fiona Messent, the Qantas Group’s chief sustainability officer, said SAF remains the airline’s most viable near-term decarbonisation option.

“As well as funding, this partnership will help provide a vote of confidence in new technologies so they can be developed, scaled and integrated in the SAF supply chain,” she said.

“For Australia, an onshore SAF industry will mean improved national fuel security, more jobs and economic benefit.”

CTP, which specialises in scaling climate-related technologies in sectors like energy and logistics, will invest in both local and international start-ups on behalf of Qantas and Airbus. The companies may later pursue additional investments in ventures that show promise for application in Australia.

Julie Kitcher, Airbus Chief Sustainability Officer, added that decarbonising aviation demands cooperation from across the aviation and energy landscape.

“This partnership with CTP and Qantas highlights that the scaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel needs innovative solutions for a nascent technology that will drive innovation, attract investment and create new jobs in Australia.”

The move is one of a number of major initiatives by local aviation firms to embrace SAFs, which have the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions.

Last month, for example, Australian Aviation reported how Virgin has partnered with Viva Energy to trial SAF in departing flights from Whitsunday Coast Airport.

The agreement, to last from March to July 2025, will see Virgin use a blend of A1 jet fuel and 30–40 per cent synthetic SAF made from waste and residue feedstocks, which the airline says is fully compatible with existing aircraft, fuelling infrastructure and regulatory and safety requirements.

Air New Zealand, meanwhile, last year signed a deal for 9 million litres of SAF that will be blended with conventional jet fuel.

In 2022, former Qantas CEO Alan Joyce argued Australia should be beating other nations to produce large quantities of SAF.

“Australians are the most competitive people I’ve ever come across,” Joyce said. “We should be making it into a World Cup. I think we’d win if that were the case.”

Joyce was a long-term advocate of encouraging more production of SAFs in Australia, branding it a “huge opportunity” that would create “a huge amount of jobs”.

HAR2 enables the developers of hydrogen production projects to compete for capital grant support and revenue support, the latter under the Hydrogen Production Business Model.

Through the previous round, HAR1, held by Rishi Sunak’s administration, DESNZ confirmed £90m in capital grant support and more than £2bn of revenue support to 11 projects totalling 124MW of production capacity.

Five of these projects have signed their contracts, including the Bradford Low Carbon project in Yorkshire and the Cromarty Hydrogen Project in northeast Scotland.

The UK Government is hoping for the nation to host 10GW of low-carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 – a target set by the Conservatives. The Labour-led Government has subsequently claimed that the hydrogen industry has the potential to attract more than £1bn of private sector investment into the UK by 2029.

Industry Minister Sarah Jones said: “We are deploying hydrogen at a commercial scale for the first time – not just investing in a technology – but investing in British jobs, our proud manufacturing communities and our energy security.

“From distilleries and sustainable aviation fuel to public transport and clean energy

generation, hydrogen can power our everyday life and unlock clean energy growth across the country as part of our Plan for Change.”

Low-carbon hydrogen standard

Only projects which meet the UK Government’s low-carbon hydrogen standard are eligible to apply for HAR1 and HAR2 funding.

Hydrogen is fast becoming a popular option for decarbonising heating processes and transport fuels, as it produces no greenhouse gas emissions at the point of combustion. However, hydrogen needs to be manufactured, and this process can be high-carbon. Around 92% of global hydrogen production is ‘grey’, i.e. produced by steam methane reforming from fossil fuels.

The 27 shortlisted projects are a mix of green hydrogen projects, whereby hydrogen is produced via electrolysis processes with water that are powered by renewable electricity, and projects where fossil fuels are used and man-made carbon capture technologies are deployed.

Hydrogen produced from the shortlisted projects would serve a range of industries including glass manufacturing, brick making, ammonia production and the production of alternative aviation fuels.

A full list of the shortlisted projects can be found here.

The Hydrogen Energy Association’s CEO Dr Emma Guthrie said the shortlist is a “much-anticipated announcement” which “brings vital clarity” to the sector.

Dr Guthrie added: “The funding support offered through HAR2 gives our members and the wider industry the confidence to gear up for delivery, unlocking investment, creating jobs, and driving economic growth.”

A project’s inclusion on the shortlist does not guarantee Government support and, as was the case with HAR1, it is unlikely that all projects shortlisted under HAR2 will secure Government funding. The developers of the shortlisted projects are required to further develop their projects and provide updated information to DESNZ.

This is a big move as the airline navigates through its steps of strategic development, reconsolidating its status as one of China’s top airlines.

Boeing 787-8 Phasing out from Fleet

China Southern Airlines’ fleet restructuring started back in 2022. Three of China’s top airlines have been at their fifth year of loss following a recent release of financial results for 2024. Restructuring the fleet has helped China Southern Airlines boost operational cost-effectiveness.

As the first Chinese airline to operate with Boeing 787-8 aircraft, the airline is now phasing the model out. They own a total of 28 Boeing 787 aircraft, and after selling 10 787-8 aircraft, the fleet will operate with only 787-9 aircraft. The model has a higher passenger capacity and longer flight distance. With this restructuring step, the airline expects higher operational efficiency, which would lessen its loss and potentially bring in more revenue as the market evolves.

The deal’s starting total price is at RMB 3.964 B.

Fleet Restructuring and Strategic Development

This is not the first step China Southern Airlines has taken to recover from its loss. Starting from 2022, the airline has sold multiple A380 aircraft, amounting to RMB 14.7 B, and these steps have seen significant improvement in the airline’s performance.

With increasing competition both domestically and internationally, China’s top airlines have taken different steps to up their game in the aviation industry. Besides expanding flight routes to different regions, fleet updating and restructuring is undoubtedly also key to polishing the airline’s operations.

This step in strategic development shows again the airline’s ambition to consolidate its influence as China’s leading airline.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Boeing_787-8_China_Southern_Airlines_16182136580.jpg?fit=1280%2C815&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-07 07:56:09.636042

LATAM’s Commitment to Sustainable Aviation in Colombia LATAM Airlines has been working for over a decade to promote sustainable fuels in Latin America.","From Ernesto Cortissoz Airport in Barranquilla, Ecopetrol and LATAM Airlines Colombia announced a strategic alliance to promote the energy transition in the aviation sector.

This agreement aims to combine the expertise of both companies: Ecopetrol in fuel production and LATAM in airline operations and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) testing.

First Flights with Low-Emission Fuel

As part of this collaboration, LATAM Airlines Colombia will operate more than 700 flights using Jet A1 co-processed with 1% renewable raw materials, produced at Ecopetrol’s Cartagena refinery.

This fuel will be distributed at the airports of Barranquilla, Medellín, and San Andrés, marking a milestone in the adoption of SAF in the country.

For Ricardo Roa Barragán, president of Ecopetrol, this initiative represents a key step toward developing more sustainable fuels:

“This is the beginning of a transformation that will enable the production and use of sustainable aviation fuels in Colombia and Latin America. At Ecopetrol, we remain committed to innovations that bring us closer to fuels with up to 50% renewable components.”

Meanwhile, Erika Zarante, CEO of LATAM Airlines Colombia, emphasized the importance of this agreement in the airline’s environmental strategy:

“LATAM was the first airline to operate flights with biofuels in Colombia. This alliance is another step forward in our commitment to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint and strengthen local infrastructure for SAF development.”

Emission Offsets and Supply Chain

In line with its sustainability goals, LATAM will offset the emissions generated by transporting this fuel through the Co2Bio project, which protects over 270,000 hectares of forests and wetlands in Colombia’s Orinoquía region.

Additionally, the distribution and storage of the co-processed fuel will be managed by World Fuel Services and Chevron.

Andrés Roque, Vice President of Supply for Latin America at World Fuel Services, highlighted the importance of this regional effort:

“We have supplied more than 170 million liters of SAF worldwide. Being part of this initiative in Latin America demonstrates our commitment and that of our strategic partners.”

Research and Development of SAF in Colombia

The fuel used in this alliance is the result of more than 15 years of research by the Colombian Institute of Petroleum and Energy for the Transition (ICPET), which has developed methods to incorporate renewable raw materials into refining.

The co-processed Jet A1 fuel was produced in October 2024 at the Cartagena Refinery and meets international ASTM D1655-24b standards, ensuring its compatibility with commercial aircraft without technical modifications.

Looking ahead, Ecopetrol plans to establish sustained SAF production at the Cartagena refinery and develop a dedicated plant in Barrancabermeja.

Depending on the technologies applied, this fuel could reduce CO₂ emissions by 50% to 80% compared to conventional Jet A1.

LATAM’s Commitment to Sustainable Aviation in Colombia

LATAM Airlines has been working for over a decade to promote sustainable fuels in Latin America. In 2013, it operated the first flight with biofuel in Colombia, and since then, has formed alliances to strengthen the regional industry.

A study led by LATAM and Airbus, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), found that Colombia has one of the highest SAF production potentials in the region, thanks to its agricultural capacity, competitive costs, and biofuels expertise.",https://latamobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ecopetrol-LATAM-Airlines-Alianza-descarbonizacion-SAF-1-1024x683-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-07 08:56:29.858881

Alternative aviation fuels can be produced from a variety of feedstocks and can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with traditional kerosene-based fuels.
As well as reducing Microsoft’s emissions from business travel, the funding for alternative aviation fuel will also cut CO2 from the company’s freight carried by IAG’s airlines.

IAG, which owns British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, originally struck a co-funding deal with Microsoft for what the aviation industry calls sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in 2023.

In a statement, the two companies said the new five-year deal was the “largest and longest” agreement between an airline operator and a corporate client to reduce Scope 3 emissions from the company’s business travel.

The new deal will see Microsoft co-fund an additional 39,000 tonnes of SAF, which would reduce “lifecycle” carbon emissions by approximately 113,000 tonnes. The fuel will be manufactured in the UK by Phillips 66 and at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels production facility in the US.

Alternative aviation fuels can be produced from a variety of feedstocks and can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with traditional kerosene-based fuels. Phillips 66 converts used cooking oil and food waste into jet fuel, while Lanzajet creates bioethanol from alcohol.

As well as reducing Microsoft’s emissions from business travel, the funding for alternative aviation fuel will also cut CO2 from the company’s freight carried by IAG’s airlines.

Julia Fidler, Microsoft’s environmental sustainability fuel and materials decarbonisation lead, said the extended deal with IAG would bring the company “closer to our goal of being carbon negative by 2030”, as well as helping to increase production of alternative fuels.

""We are pleased to work alongside IAG on efforts to increase demand and make SAF more widely available through our shared long-term purchase agreement,” she added.

IAG has set the target of using at least 10 per cent alternative fuel for its flights by 2030 – these fuels made up 1.9 per cent of the group’s total fuel mix during 2024.

Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s group sustainability officer, added: “We’re pleased to work with like-minded organisations such as Microsoft to expand efforts to reduce flying lifecycle emissions.

“Long-term agreements help encourage much-needed funding in SAF production, something that IAG is championing through our investment in global SAF projects such as LanzaJet.”",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/BTNE/uploadedImages/1_News/Air_Travel/LanzaJet%20Freedom%20Pines%20Fuels%20%20web.jpg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-04-07 07:56:28.819962

These ZEV Mandate updates aim to provide greater flexibility for automakers while keeping the country on track to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030.

The revised ZEV Mandate, unveiled as part of a broader strategy to reinforce industrial growth amidst global economic uncertainty, will make it easier for manufacturers to adapt production lines and meet evolving consumer demands.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasised that British brands such as Rolls-Royce, Vauxhall, and Land Rover will benefit from enhanced stability and long-term support as they transition to electric vehicle (EV) production.

Starmer added: “I am determined to back British brilliance. Now more than ever, UK businesses and working people need a government that steps up, not stands aside.

“That means action, not words. So today, I am announcing bold changes to the way we support our car industry.

“This will help ensure home-grown firms can export British cars built by British workers around the world, and the industry can look forward with confidence, as well as back with pride.”

Flexibility and realism for a smoother transition

Recognising the complexity of transitioning to EV manufacturing, the UK Government has adjusted the ZEV Mandate to give carmakers more leeway.

While the core 2030 target remains – phasing out the sale of new petrol and diesel cars – manufacturers will now have increased flexibility on how and when they meet emissions targets leading up to the deadline.

Among the key revisions are the extended allowances for hybrid vehicle sales, with models like the Toyota Prius and Nissan e-Power permitted until 2035.

Additionally, rules allowing manufacturers to borrow ZEV credits will continue through to 2030, helping them manage production and innovation timelines more effectively.

This flexibility includes the ability to transfer credits between vans and cars, with defined ratios to preserve credibility in carbon reduction.

EV demand surges as government doubles down on infrastructure

The UK’s commitment to electrification is underscored by rising EV sales, which jumped over 40% in March compared to last year.

With over 382,000 electric vehicles sold in the UK in 2024, the nation now leads the European market and ranks third globally.

To support this growth, more than 75,000 public EV chargepoints are already in operation, with new ones being installed every 29 minutes.

A further £2.3bn in public funding is boosting British EV manufacturing and expanding the country’s charging network. This is complemented by generous tax incentives aimed at making EV ownership more accessible.

With operational savings of around £1,100 annually for EV drivers charging at home overnight and a growing selection of affordable models – including nearly 30 new electric cars under £30,000 – the shift to electric is becoming increasingly attractive to UK motorists.

Safeguarding British icons while embracing change

In a nod to the UK’s rich automotive heritage, small and micro-volume manufacturers – including luxury marques like McLaren and Aston Martin – will be exempt from ZEV Mandate targets.

This approach allows Britain’s high-performance vehicle segment to continue thriving without compromising the broader push for electrification.

The updated mandate also grants van manufacturers additional time, with internal combustion engine (ICE) vans permitted until 2035.

This phased transition will provide essential breathing space for both large-scale producers and supply chains to scale up zero-emission options.

A modern industrial strategy to power the future

Scheduled for full release this spring, a new Industrial Strategy will provide the roadmap for capitalising on emerging sectors like EVs.

The strategy is expected to focus on securing investment, supporting innovation, and driving sustainable economic growth across the UK.

In tandem with these plans, the government is working closely with the automotive sector to adapt to changing global trade dynamics.

As new international tariffs come into play, particularly from the United States, UK ministers have pledged to keep industry support under review and ensure competitiveness is protected.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander added: “We will always back British business. In the face of global economic challenges and stifled by a lack of certainty and direction for too long, our automotive industry deserves clarity, ambition and leadership. That is exactly what we are delivering today.

“Our ambitious package of strengthening reforms will protect and create jobs – making the UK a global automotive leader in the switch to EVs – all the while meeting our core manifesto commitment to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030.”

ZEV mandate marks a turning point for the UK automotive industry

With the ZEV Mandate updates, the UK Government is balancing ambition with practicality – ensuring that its climate targets remain intact while providing crucial breathing room for automakers.

As the country accelerates towards a zero-emission future, the combination of policy flexibility, infrastructure investment, and market incentives is positioning the UK as a global leader in electric mobility.

The changes announced today highlight a unified effort to future-proof the British car industry, spark innovation, and deliver sustainable growth for future generations.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shutterstock_2374438937.jpg,N,,2025-04-07 07:56:34.782494

“We’ve launched the design of a small engine demonstrator, which is around the kind of thrust level you’d need for a narrow body application,” says Alan Newby, Rolls-Royce’s director of aerospace technology and future programs.
The broader strategy also includes renewed investment in tests of the larger UltraFan, which will continue to be developed in parallel.
“I don’t know whether it’s going to be a widebody first, a narrowbody first, Boeing first or Airbus first.
“We are rebuilding engine one [the first UltraFan demonstrator] now, and our plan is to get that ready to test by the end of this year.","Rolls-Royce aims by mid-year to freeze the design of a smaller demonstrator version of the UltraFan geared turbofan as part of plans signaling its serious intent to target the single-aisle market in the 2030s.

The demonstrator is scheduled to undergo ground tests in 2028 and will pave the way for a more than 30,000-lb.-thrust class engine designed to power successors to the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737. The initiative fulfills a strategic goal unveiled by CEO Tufan Erginbilgic in late 2023 and marks a key step in Rolls-Royce’s renewed ambition to reenter the narrowbody sector, which it effectively abandoned with the 2012 sale to Pratt & Whitney of its shares in the International Aero Engines collaborative venture.

The new geared engine demonstrator will leverage technology developed for the much larger 80,000-lb.-thrust UltraFan, which ran in 2023 and is positioned to compete in the lower thrust bracket with the Open Fan in development by CFM joint venture partners GE Aerospace and Safran, as well as a next-generation variant of Pratt & Whitney’s PW1100G geared turbofan.

“We’ve launched the design of a small engine demonstrator, which is around the kind of thrust level you’d need for a narrow body application,” says Alan Newby, Rolls-Royce’s director of aerospace technology and future programs. “The reason for doing that is manifold. One is to show to our customers that we’re serious about it, show to our suppliers that we’re serious about it and also show to our potential partners that we’re serious about it,” he adds.

“Whatever happens regarding airframe strategies, and any partner strategies that can happen, we want to make sure that we’ve got the technology ready and proven at that scale, so that we’re ready to adapt,” Newby says. The broader strategy also includes renewed investment in tests of the larger UltraFan, which will continue to be developed in parallel.

The plan covers all potential new aircraft developments, Newby says. “I don’t know whether it’s going to be a widebody first, a narrowbody first, Boeing first or Airbus first. So we’ve got to make sure that we are ready for any eventuality from the market perspective, and we’ve got the technology proven at both scales,” he adds.

“That’s effectively what I’m trying to do at the moment, is make sure we’ve got the data on both large and small engines, so we’re ready to go when the market decides which way it’s going to jump,” Newby says. “We are rebuilding engine one [the first UltraFan demonstrator] now, and our plan is to get that ready to test by the end of this year. In parallel, we’ve got another engine that we’re rebuilding. And that one that will go on to do further testing, and possibly other assets on top of that one.”

The small UltraFan initiative leverages design elements developed for Rolls-Royce’s Pearl 10X—a business jet engine based on the company’s Advance2 core project. It also leans on technologies from Heaven—for Hydrogen Engine Architecture Virtually Engineered Novelly—an ongoing project under Europe’s Clean Aviation research initiative aimed specifically at scaling the UltraFan architecture to suit short-medium range applications.

Targeting a 20% integrated fuel burn reduction, as well as enabled for sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen, the Heaven project has included tests of an advanced power gearbox, improved combustor designs and the design of a new intermediate pressure turbine.

Further tests planned for the second half of Heaven include completion of the preliminary design of an SMR engine and validation of elements to a technology readiness level of five. “Clean Aviation Phase Two is about taking those to demonstration, so clearly that’s an opportunity to put something like this into that program,” Newby says.

“We also continue to work closely with the ATI [the UK Aerospace Technology Institute] and in Germany as well. So there’s a range of funding sources we can use on that one, but it fits well with the calls in Europe at the moment,” he adds.

Rolls-Royce, meanwhile, declines to comment on reports in the Financial Times that it is in talks with the UK government to help fund part of the estimated $3.9 billion (£3 billion) development cost for the smaller UltraFan. However, a spokesperson for the engine-maker says, “we believe narrowbody represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver a step-change in growth for the UK economy.”

The engine-maker believes the narrowbody market is potentially worth more than £100 billion to the UK in terms of the gross value added it would create for the economy through taxable jobs, exports and economic activity in the supply chain. Rolls, which currently employs 21,000 people in the UK and invests around £800 million a year in R&D, also believes that entry into the narrowbody engine field could create 40,000 new skilled jobs across the company and the supply chain.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-04-07 07:57:11.518693

Raghunath has remained a staunch and resilient leader during such an uncertain time and is very much appreciated by his team.

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

Clare Jackson, CEO of Hydrogen UK, said: We’re thrilled to see many Hydrogen UK members succeed in the second Hydrogen Allocation Round, marking a crucial step for scaling electrolytic hydrogen.","A new wave of hydrogen powered projects have been shortlisted today (Monday 7 April) to help cut emissions and create thousands of jobs in the UK’s industrial heartlands – driving growth as part of the government’s Plan for Change.

Twenty-seven hydrogen projects have been selected for the next stage of the Second Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR2) – supporting low-carbon hydrogen production in the UK. The industry has the potential to attract over £1 billion of private sector investment into the UK by 2029, supporting the government’s mission to become a clean energy superpower.

Hydrogen will help deliver a new era of clean energy across the UK and decarbonise emission-intensive industries. It has already attracted £400 million of private sector investment in towns and cities such as Milford Haven in Wales and High Marnham in Nottinghamshire, and is creating over 700 direct jobs in construction and operations.

Government support for hydrogen will help create thousands more jobs in the sector and reindustrialising the UK’s proud manufacturing regions. This includes roles for apprentices, graduates and technically trained professionals, such as engineers, welders, skilled construction workers, pipefitters and operations specialists.

Today’s shortlist includes projects that could use hydrogen to help tackle the climate crisis by decarbonising their manufacturing and industrial practices, including ammonia production, new clean power generation, glass manufacturing, brick making, and sustainable aviation fuel production.

Industry Minister Sarah Jones, said:

We are deploying hydrogen at a commercial scale for the first time – not just investing in a technology – but investing in British jobs, our proud manufacturing communities and our energy security.

From distilleries and sustainable aviation fuel to public transport and clean energy generation, hydrogen can power our everyday life and unlock clean energy growth across the country as part of our Plan for Change.

Green hydrogen is produced by using renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, resulting in a zero-carbon fuel that can be used for power generation, transport and industrial processes.

This builds on the success of the First Hydrogen Allocation Round which saw 11 projects being allocated over £2 billion in government funding. One recipient, Whitelee Green Hydrogen in Scotland, will produce hydrogen for the Inchdairnie Whiskey distillery which intends to sustainably distil whisky by 2027.

Stretching across England, Scotland, and Wales, this latest wave of shortlisted HAR2 projects showcases the government’s commitment to create skilled jobs and establish clean energy hubs across Great Britain. The HAR2 shortlist could lead to projects that help support strong supply chains and the delivery of the clean energy superpower mission.

Dr Emma Guthrie, CEO of the Hydrogen Energy Association, said:

This much-anticipated announcement brings vital clarity to the UK’s hydrogen sector, providing a crucial boost for projects that will drive forward the country’s low-carbon transition.

The funding support offered through HAR2 gives our members and the wider industry the confidence to gear up for delivery, unlocking investment, creating jobs, and driving economic growth.

This is great news - not just for the hydrogen sector but for the UK’s ambition to become energy secure and a global leader in clean energy.

Clare Jackson, CEO of Hydrogen UK, said:

We’re thrilled to see many Hydrogen UK members succeed in the second Hydrogen Allocation Round, marking a crucial step for scaling electrolytic hydrogen.

This progress builds on valuable lessons from past rounds and strengthens UK leadership in clean energy - reinforcing the sector’s crucial role in economic growth and energy security.

Case studies

In December 2023, the government announced an initial 11 projects from the First Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR1), totalling 124 MW of production capacity.

Five of these projects have signed their contracts, including the Bradford Low Carbon project in Yorkshire and the Cromarty Hydrogen Project in northeast Scotland.

The Bradford Low Carbon project, in the heart of the city centre, will use renewable electricity to power a 10.6 MW alkaline electrolyser. Being developed by Hygen and Ryze, it will supply the mobility sector, including JCB diggers and Wrightbus - which developed the world’s first hydrogen powered bus.

The Cromarty Hydrogen Project is being developed by Scottish Power and Storegga. It will use electricity from nearby wind farms to power an 11 MW electrolyser, supplying hydrogen to local industries, including distilleries.

The Minnesota Senate Taxes Committee approved legislation in early March 2025 to expand an existing tax credit to encourage the increased production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The current law, which applied a $1.50-per-gallon tax incentive to biomass-derived SAF that achieved at least a 50% reduction in life-cycle greenhouse gas pollution, was originally set to expire on June 30, 2030.

Now, it has been extended to July 1, 2035, and includes an additional provision allowing qualified taxpayers to claim an additional 2 cents per gallon for each percentage point above the base 50% threshold, capping at 50 cents per gallon.

""Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to rapidly decarbonize the aviation industry, provide additional revenue streams for a wide array of farmers, communities, and industries, and create good-paying jobs throughout Minnesota,"" Sen. Robert Kupec (D-MN), one of the co-sponsors of the bill, said in an official statement.

Sen. John Jasinski, another co-sponsor, also emphasized the bill's potential to bolster job creation and expand opportunities for farmers across the state to support crop production and eliminate waste, calling it an ""economic jet engine for the state of Minnesota.""

Fuel Efficiency Maßnahmen Lufthansa Cargo strebt eine maximale Reduktion der CO2-Emissionen im Flugbetrieb an und setzt dabei auf effektive Maßnahmen.
Durch gezielte Fuel Efficiency-Maßnahmen konnte Lufthansa Cargo im Jahr 2024 rund 5.700 Tonnen Kerosin einsparen, was einer CO2-Reduktion von rund 18.000 Tonnen entspricht.
Gleichzeitig wurde die Ladeinfrastruktur im Lufthansa Cargo Center (LCC) mit insgesamt sechs Ladepunkten an zwei Gebäuden umgesetzt.
Die Zusammenarbeit mit dem branchenführenden SFC-Netzwerk unterstützt die Strategie von Lufthansa Cargo für eine nachhaltigere Zukunft.","Verantwortungsvolles Handeln ist die Grundlage der unternehmerischen Tätigkeit von Lufthansa Cargo. Die Frachtfluglinie setzt auf Qualität, Sicherheit und Zuverlässigkeit beim Luftfrachttransport und ermöglicht globalen Handel so nachhaltig wie möglich. „Unser Anspruch ist es, Verantwortung zu übernehmen und unsere ehrgeizigen Klimaziele weiter voranzutreiben“, sagt Nicole Mies, Head of Communications & Corporate Social Responsibility bei Lufthansa Cargo. „Im Jahr 2024 haben wir gemeinsam mit unseren Kunden, Partnern und der Wissenschaft neue Möglichkeiten ausgelotet, viele Schritte unternommen und wertvolle Fortschritte erzielt. Nicht überall stehen wir schon da, wo wir hinwollen – aber wir arbeiten konsequent weiter daran, eine Luftfracht zu gestalten, die effizient, innovativ und zukunftsorientiert ist.“

Das weltweite Umweltmanagementsystem von Lufthansa Cargo ist erneut nach dem internationalen Umweltstandard ISO 14001 zertifiziert. Es stellt die kontinuierliche und transparente Steuerung, Überwachung und Verbesserung der Umweltbilanz sicher – und das nicht nur in der Luft, sondern auch am Boden. Zur Aufrechterhaltung der Zertifizierung weist das Unternehmen jährlich externen Gutachtern nach, dass die Anforderungen der Norm eingehalten werden und das System auf allen Ebenen funktioniert und gelebt wird.

Moderne Flotte

Als Airline entsteht der gesamte CO2-Fußabdruck von Lufthansa Cargo zu fast 99 Prozent durch den Flugbetrieb. Der derzeit größte Hebel zur Reduktion von CO2 in der Luftfahrt ist der Einsatz neuer, treibstoffeffizienterer Flugzeuge. Flugzeuge der neuesten Generation verbrauchen im Vergleich zu ihren jeweiligen Vorgängermodellen bis zu 30 Prozent weniger Treibstoff und emittieren entsprechend weniger CO2. Lufthansa Cargo setzt in ihrer eigenen Langstreckenflotte mit einem Durchschnittsalter von 7,6 Jahren ausschließlich auf die Boeing 777F – das derzeit modernste und effizienteste Frachtflugzeug seiner Klasse. Im Sommer 2024 begrüßte das Unternehmen seinen 18. Langstreckenfrachter am Flughafen Frankfurt. Weitere sieben Boeing 777-8-Frachter mit der kommenden Technologie sind bestellt und werden bis 2030 erwartet.

SAF-Kooperationen

Der Einsatz von Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) ist für nachhaltigeres Fliegen ein entscheidender technologischer Schlüssel und essenziell für die Energiewende in der Luftfahrt. Auf Basis von biogenen Reststoffen hat es über den gesamten Lebenszyklus einen rund 80 Prozent geringeren CO2-Fußabdruck als herkömmliches Kerosin. Mit ihrem Add-on Service „Sustainable Choice“ lädt Lufthansa Cargo alle Kunden dazu ein, einen Beitrag zur Dekarbonisierung der Luftfracht zu leisten. Der optionale Service kann einfach über die Lufthansa Cargo-Homepage hinzugebucht werden und kombiniert die CO2-Reduktion durch SAF-Einsatz mit der Kompensation durch den Beitrag zu hochwertigen Klimaschutzprojekten. Gleichzeitig können große, individuelle Vereinbarungen, sogenannte Bulk Deals, auf interessierte Partner von Lufthansa Cargo zugeschnitten werden. Im Jahr 2024 konnte Lufthansa Cargo auf diese Weise rund 8.500 Tonnen CO2einsparen.

Fuel Efficiency Maßnahmen

Lufthansa Cargo strebt eine maximale Reduktion der CO2-Emissionen im Flugbetrieb an und setzt dabei auf effektive Maßnahmen. Neben einer modernen Flotte und dem Einsatz von nachhaltigem Flugkraftstoff (SAF) liegt der Fokus auf der kontinuierlichen Optimierung des Flugbetriebs. Durch gezielte Fuel Efficiency-Maßnahmen konnte Lufthansa Cargo im Jahr 2024 rund 5.700 Tonnen Kerosin einsparen, was einer CO2-Reduktion von rund 18.000 Tonnen entspricht. Den größten Einzelbeitrag leistet dabei die Statistical Contingency Fuel-Methode (SCF). Diese statistische Analyse ermöglicht, einen Teil der benötigten Reservekraftstoffmenge für jeden Flug präziser zu kalkulieren. Dabei werden historische Flugverbräuche analysiert und aktuelle Faktoren – beispielsweise Wetterbedingungen am Zielflughafen – bei der Treibstoffplanung berücksichtigt. So lassen sich unnötige Kraftstoffreserven vermeiden, ohne die Flugsicherheit zu beeinträchtigen. Darüber hinaus wurde SCF Ende des Jahres 2024 durch eine weitere automatisierte Datenintegration ergänzt, um die Kraftstoffplanung für das Rollen am Boden vor dem Start noch präziser zu kalkulieren. Diese optimierte Taxi Fuel-Berechnung erhöht somit zusätzlich die Effizienz der Treibstoffplanung für den gesamten Flugprozess.

Eine weitere wichtige Maßnahme ist ""RETI"" (Reduced Engine during Taxi In): Dabei wird beim Rollen zur Parkposition – wenn möglich – ein Triebwerk abgeschaltet, wodurch jährlich rund 400 Tonnen Kerosin und 1200 Tonnen CO2 eingespart werden.

Maßnahmen am Boden

Am Boden arbeitet die Frachtfluglinie mit Hochdruck an dem Ziel der CO2-Neutralität bis 2030. Zusätzlich sucht die Organisation im Teamwork immer neue Wege, um Energie, Treibstoffe, Ressourcen und Abfälle zu vermeiden. Ein Beispiel der zahlreichen Maßnahmen aus dem Jahr 2024 ist der Umstellungsstart der Operations-Dienstwagenflotte auf E-Fahrzeuge. Die insgesamt 30 Fahrzeuge, die für Dienstfahrten am Hub Frankfurt eingesetzt werden, sollen schrittweise gegen neue E-Fahrzeuge ausgetauscht werden. Die ersten Neuwagen sind bereits eingetroffen und im Einsatz. Gleichzeitig wurde die Ladeinfrastruktur im Lufthansa Cargo Center (LCC) mit insgesamt sechs Ladepunkten an zwei Gebäuden umgesetzt.

Darüber hinaus werden seit Sommer 2024 defekte und abgelaufene Frachtgurte in Zusammenarbeit mit der WfB Rhein-Main e.V. recycelt. Das wiederverwendbare Material wird für Baustellenabsicherungen oder Dämmplatten genutzt, das Aluminium der Spannschlösser wiederverwertet. So spart Lufthansa Cargo in Frankfurt jährlich mehrere Tonnen Abfall.

100-Flüge-Programm

Zudem unterstützt Lufthansa Cargo aktiv die Erforschung der so genannten Nicht-CO2-Klimaeffekte des Luftverkehrs. Um deren Auswirkungen besser zu verstehen und Maßnahmen zur Verringerung der Gesamtklimawirkung abzuleiten, beteiligt sich die Lufthansa Group an Forschungsprojekten. Lufthansa Cargo hat im Jahr 2024 gemeinsam mit Lufthansa Airlines und anderen deutschen Fluggesellschaften am „100-Flüge-Programm“ teilgenommen, das vom Arbeitskreis klimaneutrale Luftfahrt des Bundeswirtsschafts- und Bundesverkehrsministeriums initiiert wurde. Lufthansa Cargo hat hierfür 23 Flüge ausgewählt, von denen 13 in der Routenplanung in der Flughöhe angepasst wurden, um Kondensstreifen zu vermeiden, und weitere zehn Referenzflüge zum Vergleich. Ziel ist es, Daten zur Vorhersage von Kondensstreifen-Gebieten in der Flugplanung zu nutzen und ihre Qualität und Verlässlichkeit zu testen. Zum Nachweis, ob auf umgeleiteten Flügen tatsächlich Kondensstreifen vermieden werden konnten, werden Satellitenbeobachtungen herangezogen und ausgewertet. Die Auswertung der Flüge erfolgt im Rahmen des Forschungsprojekts „D-KULT“ auf Basis der dort entwickelten Daten und Prototypen von Computerprogrammen, zusammen mit den Projektpartnern Deutscher Wetterdienst, Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS), Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) und Lufthansa Systems.

Klimaschutz ist Teamwork

Der notwendige Wandel kann nur gemeinsam mit starken Partnern erreicht werden. Lufthansa Cargo ist eng vernetzt und im aktiven Austausch mit ihren Kunden und Innovationstreibern aus Forschung, Wirtschaft und Politik. Im Jahr 2024 konnte das Unternehmen beispielsweise den Beitritt zur Smart Freight Centre Community bekanntgeben. Das Smart Freight Centre (SFC) ist eine internationale Non-Profit-Organisation, die sich auf die Reduzierung von Treibhausgasemissionen im Güterverkehr konzentriert. Ihr Ziel ist es, Mitglieder und Partner bei der Reduzierung ihrer Treibhausgasemissionen zu unterstützen, um bis zum Jahr 2050 oder früher einen emissionsfreien globalen Logistiksektor zu erreichen, der mit dem Pariser Klimaschutzabkommen vereinbar ist. Die Zusammenarbeit mit dem branchenführenden SFC-Netzwerk unterstützt die Strategie von Lufthansa Cargo für eine nachhaltigere Zukunft.

This action follows a court order from the circuit court in Florida. The 3 planes are seized at Miami International Airport.

The Ongoing Year-Long Court Case

This seizure is part of the decision of a court case filed a year ago by the investors. From a spoken agreement, the investor company, while lending 3 aircraft to the airline, would get compensation for each flight operated with those aircraft.

The agreement was between Blue Diamond General Investments and Miami-Dade-based Caribbean Sun Airlines. The leased aircraft operates under the name World Atlantic Airlines.

The complaint from the investment company follows World Atlantic Airlines’ inability to pay the compensation from passenger flights operated with the aircraft.

Aircraft Seized Until Debt is Repaid

With attempts to solve this dispute through a payment schedule, the airline now owes the investment firm over USD 1.8M (£1.43M).

The 3 McDonnell Douglas MD-83 aircraft in the lease are now being held at the Miami International Airport by the Miami-Dade Sheriff’s office.

The 3 planes seized in Miami for now will not be flying again until the debt is repaid to the investment company.

Why the Bombardier Global 5500 is the preferred jet for high-flyers

Charles Schwab is not alone in choosing the Bombardier Global 5500. This jet is favored by high-net-worth individuals who require a combination of performance, luxury, and efficiency. Here’s why it stands out:

Exceptional range and speed

The Global 5500 is built for efficiency, boasting a top speed of Mach 0.90. Its ability to fly over 5,900 nautical miles nonstop means Schwab can travel between major cities worldwide without layovers or refueling stops. Compared to commercial flights, this significantly reduces travel time, making business trips more productive.

World-class cabin comfort

Bombardier designed the Global 5500's cabin with passenger well-being in mind. The spacious interior can accommodate up to 16 passengers, featuring plush leather seats that convert into fully flat beds. The aircraft’s low cabin altitude, improved air circulation, and panoramic windows help reduce fatigue and jet lag, ensuring a comfortable journey.

Cutting-edge technology and safety features

Equipped with the Vision Flight Deck, the Global 5500 features advanced avionics, synthetic vision, and enhanced flight controls that provide pilots with unparalleled situational awareness. This enhances safety and ensures a smoother flight experience.

Why Charles Schwab relies on private aviation

As a leading business executive and investor, Charles Schwab frequently travels between global financial centers, corporate meetings, and speaking engagements. Relying on commercial airlines would mean dealing with long security lines, unpredictable layovers, and rigid flight schedules. By owning a private jet like the Global 5500, Schwab gains unparalleled convenience, privacy, and flexibility, allowing him to optimize his travel and maximize his time.

One of the key advantages of private aviation is time efficiency. Instead of navigating the complexities of commercial air travel, Schwab can depart and arrive on his own terms. This eliminates unnecessary delays, ensuring that he reaches his destinations as quickly and smoothly as possible. Privacy and security are also major benefits of flying private. A private jet offers complete confidentiality, which is crucial for high-stakes business discussions. Whether reviewing financial strategies or negotiating deals, Schwab can conduct meetings in a secure and distraction-free environment.

Another advantage is access to smaller airports. The Global 5500’s capabilities allow it to land at regional and private airports that commercial airlines do not serve. This significantly reduces total travel time by cutting down on lengthy commutes from major hubs to final destinations. Additionally, onboard productivity is a key factor in Schwab’s reliance on private aviation. With a spacious, quiet cabin equipped with high-speed connectivity, he can seamlessly conduct meetings, catch up on work, or rest in complete comfort. The aircraft is designed for efficiency, ensuring that travel time is never wasted.

Owning a private jet is not just about indulgence—it’s a practical business decision. In summary, here’s why private jets are a smart investment for business leaders and billionaires like Charles Schwab:

Maximizing Time Efficiency: Time is the most valuable asset for business leaders. With a private jet, Schwab can avoid layovers, delays, and security lines, ensuring faster and more efficient travel.

Privacy & Security: In the financial industry, confidentiality is crucial. Private jets allow for sensitive discussions without the risk of being overheard.

Access to More Airports: Private jets can land at thousands of smaller airports, bringing executives closer to their final destinations and saving additional travel time.

Comfort and Productivity: Unlike the cramped seating of commercial planes, the Global 5500 offers a spacious, quiet cabin, making it an ideal workspace or resting area for long flights.

For high-profile individuals like Schwab, private aviation is not just a luxury, it’s a strategic business tool that enhances efficiency, security, and overall productivity – essential for maintaining a competitive edge.

How the Global 5500 compares to other private jets

The Bombardier Global 5500 competes with other high-end private jets, including the Gulfstream G600 and Dassault Falcon 8X. Each aircraft offers unique benefits, but the Global 5500 stands out for its balanced combination of performance, luxury, and efficiency.

While Gulfstream and Dassault offer competitive models, the Global 5500 remains a top choice for executives who prioritize efficiency, comfort, and fuel economy.

The Bombardier Global family: a range of luxurious variants

It's worth noting that the Bombardier Global 5500 is not the only jet in the Global family. The range is renowned for its cutting-edge technology, long-range capabilities, and exceptional comfort, making it one of the most sought-after names in the business aviation sector. Over the years, Bombardier has introduced several variants within the Global series, each designed to cater to the diverse needs of corporate and private travelers.

Global Express (BD-700)

Launched in 1996, the Bombardier Global Express was the first aircraft in the series and set the standard for long-range, ultra-high-performance business jets. The Global Express was designed for transcontinental travel, with a range of approximately 6,000 nautical miles, allowing non-stop flights between cities like New York and Tokyo. It offered luxurious seating and an innovative cabin design, combining spaciousness with advanced technology.

Global 5000

Introduced in 2005, the Global 5000 is a slightly smaller and more cost-effective variant of the Global Express. With a range of 5,200 nautical miles, the Global 5000 provides the same level of luxury and performance as its predecessor but is optimized for shorter routes. Its cabin offers state-of-the-art features, including customizable layouts and advanced entertainment systems, making it ideal for business or personal travel.

Global 6000

The Global 6000, launched in 2012, is a direct evolution of the Global 5000, offering enhanced range and performance. With a range of 6,000 nautical miles, the Global 6000 can connect even more city pairs non-stop. It is equipped with the latest avionics and cabin technology, offering passengers unmatched comfort and connectivity. The spacious cabin provides a variety of configurations, allowing for work, rest, and entertainment throughout the flight.

Global 7500

The flagship of the Global family, the Bombardier Global 7500, made its debut in 2018 and redefined the boundaries of ultra-long-range business jets. With a range of 7,700 nautical miles, it is capable of flying non-stop from New York to Hong Kong or from London to Los Angeles. The Global 7500 offers a full suite of luxurious amenities, including four distinct living spaces, a fully equipped galley, and even a private bedroom.

The Global 5500 remains a key player in Bombardier’s fleet, offering one of the best long-range private jet experiences available today. With continuous improvements in design and efficiency, it will likely remain a popular choice among elite travelers for years to come.

In the near future, the Global 8000 will be the newest member of the Bombardier Global family. With a projected range of 8,000 nautical miles, it will offer the longest range in its class, allowing it to fly even farther without refueling. The Global 8000 will build upon the foundation of the Global 7500, incorporating even more advanced technologies and refined luxury features to meet the evolving needs of ultra-high-net-worth individuals and corporate clients.

Final thoughts

Charles Schwab’s choice of the Bombardier Global 5500 reflects his need for a fast, efficient, and luxurious travel solution. With its impressive range, cutting-edge technology, and exceptional cabin experience, the Global 5500 is a top-tier private jet that meets the demands of high-profile executives.

SAF made from UCO not only reduces lifecycle carbon emissions compared to conventional jet fuel but also tackles industrial waste management in a sustainable way.
Bangchak CEO Chaiwat Kovavisarach emphasized the importance of expanding feedstock diversity beyond UCO and establishing national SAF usage mandates.
He called on the government to implement blending targets and investment incentives to support the long-term growth of Thailand’s SAF ecosystem.
“These steps are essential to building investor confidence, attracting long-term investment, and reinforcing Thailand’s leadership in clean aviation fuel within the region,” Chaiwat said.","BANGKOK — In a decisive move to decarbonize its aviation sector and strengthen its renewable energy portfolio, Thailand has launched a public-private initiative to develop a nationwide sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) supply chain. The effort is being spearheaded by the Ministry of Industry (MOI) in collaboration with six leading Thai corporations, with a focus on converting waste cooking oil (UCO) into aviation-grade biofuel.

The collaboration, marked by the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on March 31, is seen as a pivotal step in positioning Thailand as a regional leader in green aviation and a clean energy hub. It aligns with the government’s Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) economic strategy, which emphasizes sustainable industrial practices and circular resource use.

The six corporate partners — Central Group, Thai Beverage, Charoen Pokphand Foods, Thai President Foods, the Thai Food Processors Association, and Bangchak Corporation — are all major contributors to Thailand’s food and service sectors, producing significant quantities of used cooking oil.

By leveraging this readily available waste as feedstock, the initiative aims to lower SAF production costs and address supply constraints — key barriers to scaling green fuel alternatives. SAF made from UCO not only reduces lifecycle carbon emissions compared to conventional jet fuel but also tackles industrial waste management in a sustainable way.

The Tecnam Astore is an aircraft that has a unique and sporty design that aviation enthusiasts can appreciate.","Costruzioni Aeronautiche TECNAM S.p.A., typically shortened to just Tecnam, is a small aerospace manufacturer based out of Naples, Italy. They make aerospace components for other companies, but they also have a lineup of light aircraft that they have designed and produced themselves. One such aircraft is the Tecnam Astore, a light sport aircraft that had a limited production run by Tecnam. The small, low-wing aircraft is a fun little sport plane that can seat two pilots, and was advertised by Tecnam as having a sporty and luxurious interior. Read on to find out about the many features of the Tecnam Astore.

Sporty Performance

Acrobatic Size

An Astore is the Italian word for a Goshawk, a nimble bird of prey that the Astore lives up to. The Astore is itself nimble in size, with a total length of 22.97 ft (7 m) and an overall height of 7.55 ft (2.3 m), with its wings spanning a total of 28.38 ft (8.65 m). The potential agility of the Astore is shown off by the fact that its wingspan is longer than the length of the aircraft, allowing for more of its limited weight and structure to be dedicated to its aerobatic wings.

The Astore's wing is cantilevered and has a high aspect ratio for its size to allow for better performance and also features full flaps for enhanced landing and takeoff operations. The total area for the airplane's wing is 131 square feet (12.2 square meters), with the wings set at a dihedral angle of five degrees. The aspect ratio of the wings is also 6.2.

Its airframe is constructed entirely of aluminum, with a canopy crafted of carbon and glass composite fiber for extra weight savings. The Astore's standard empty weight is only 809 lb (367 kg) and has a maximum takeoff weight of 1,320 lb (600 kg), which is also its maximum landing weight. Its maximum useful load is 511 lb (233 kg), more than enough to carry its two pilots and any small baggage they may bring on board the aircraft.

The Astore also has a tri-cycle landing gear configuration, with the fixed landing gear being covered by aerodynamic fairings to reduce drag.

High power in a small package

While the Astore is small in size, it can punch above its weight class with its engines. The sport plane can be powered by either a 98 horsepower (72 kW) naturally aspirated Rotax 912ULS2 four-cylinder engine or a more powerful 115 horsepower (85 kW) Rotax 914UL2, the turbocharged version of the same engine. Affixed to the engine shaft can either be a two-bladed propeller, or a three-bladed propeller for enhanced performance. Feeding the engine is done by the 29 US gal (110 liters) of fuel that is carried by the Astore.

The propellers, manufactured by the company Sensenich, are constructed of wooden composite and are installed with a fixed angle, though that angle can be manually adjusted on the ground depending on the flying characteristics desired by the pilot.

Efficient cruising

The Astore can fly up to a maximum cruise ceiling of 15,000 ft (4,572 m), though you probably wouldn't want to even fly any higher given that the cabin is unpressurized. The sport plane can also be pushed to a top cruising speed of 120 knots (138 miles per hour), though the aircraft is structurally limited to a top speed of 150 knots (173 miles per hour). The aircraft can climb at a rate of 1,100 feet per minute (335 meters per minute), allowing you to achieve your maximum cruise ceiling in less than fourteen minutes. The Tecnam Astore also has a fairly short takeoff distance of 715 ft (218 m) and an even shorter landing distance of 505 ft (154 m). It has a very slow stall speed of 44 knots (51 miles per hour) with an even slower stall speed with its flaps down of 38 knots (44 miles per hour).

Probably the most impressive feature about the Tecnam Astore is its range. With only its 29 US gal (110 liters) of fuel aboard the aircraft, the Astore can cruise a maximum of 750 nautical miles (863 statute miles / 1,389 km), plenty of distance for not only for normal recreational flying but even for cross-country traveling. A Cessna 172 Skyhawk , by contrast, has a maximum range of 640 nautical miles (737 statute miles / 1,185 km) (though keep in mind that the 172 Skyhawk has a much higher payload capacity and a higher cruising speed).

Customizability

Tecnam offers the Astore with a number of available standard configurations, and also features almost 60 different options that can be added on. Astore offers the basic lowest-cost version of the Astore, and also has three additional packages with set upgrades that range in price. The packages include upgrades to:

Instrumentation and avionics

Radio and navigation equipment by both Garmin and Dynon

Autopilot

Miscellaneous equipment like microphones, speakers, and headsets

Exterior equipment like an aircraft recovery parachute and wheel and brake upgrades

Engine equipment like an auxiliary alternator or a carburetor heating system

Interior finishes and furnishings

Exterior paint scheme

The packages may come with set features but Tecnam prices all of the available options individually for customers to purchase separately for their own unique aircraft configuration. Some of their premium interior upgrades include chrome finishes to control knobs, leather and Alcántara fabric surfaces, a unique interior paint scheme, and customizable name plate.

On the exterior, Tecnam offers a variety of colors and surface paint finishes as well as a variety of paint styling. The exterior of the aircraft can be painted in the normal basic colors, like red, blue, green, etc., but Tecnam also offers additional premium paint finishes, like metallic silver, metallic gold, and metallic blue as well as chome accents. The paint schemes also feature a number of striping options that the customer can choose.

Variable pricing of the Astore

With the high customizablility of the Astore comes variations in how the Astore is priced for customers. When purchasing the plane, owners can price the aircraft to fit their needs, making the plane as cheap or as expensive as they desire.

With the more luxurious options coming in at thousands of dollars per item, customers can take the bare-bones approach and purchase the basic Astore, which starts at $147,000. This price (and the ones following) is all-inclusive with no additional charges paid by the customer. Customers only need to put 10% down as well before they take delivery, where the full amount of money owed is due. The basic Astore comes with basic analog instruments and does not feature any additional premium features.

The first option upgrade offered by the Astore starts at $167,500, which features upgrades to the instruments with additional indicators added, like attitude and flap indicators. Engine analog instruments are also added, including a tachometer, oil pressure and temperature, and fuel quantity measurements. The avionics are also added, with Garmin communications equipment added with transponder and GPS devices.

The final two options offered by Tecnam are similar to each other. The first of these two options, priced at $173,500, replaces most of the analog instruments with two Dynon avionics screens, where engine and flight parameters are displayed. In addition, the radio and communications equipment are replaced with versions supplied by Dynon. The second of these two options, priced a little higher at $176,000, effectively does the same as the previous option, but instead of Dynon hardware and electronics, they are replaced with Garmin versions.

The Tecnam Astore today

Unfortunately, it does not look like the Astore is manufactured by Tecnam anymore. Their website makes no mention of the aircraft and, presumably, it is only available for purchase in private sales as a used aircraft. Tecnam still offers other models similar to the Astore, like the P2002 and the P-mentor, both classified as light sport aircraft.

The Tecnam Astore is an aircraft that has a unique and sporty design that aviation enthusiasts can appreciate. It caters to customers that want a customizable aircraft that they can craft to match whatever tastes they may have. The pricing options and availability of upgrades make the Astore a special aircraft coming from a smaller aircraft manufacturer with smaller produciton runs. With its combination of sporty design and high fuel efficiency, the Astore stands out as a compelling option for both new aviators and seasoned pilots seeking a unique and enjoyable flying experience. Through its aircraft targeted at the light sport pilot community, Tecnam continues to solidify its reputation in the general aviation industry with aircraft like the Astore.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/artboard-16_9-8.jpg,N,,2025-04-06 19:56:30.347438
,,2025-04-06 20:19:25+00:00,meetingorganizer.copernicus.org,Advancing Direct Air Capture Technologies: From Carbon Removal to Sustainable Aviation Fuels,"Luis Signorelli Pacheco, Luis Enrique Hernández-Gutiérrez",,,,,https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU25/EGU25-12733.html%3Fpdf,"Among the suite of CDR technologies, Direct Air Capture (DAC) stands out as a scalable and targeted approach to directly reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
Zeolites are crystalline microporous aluminosilicate materials with a highly regular and tunable pore structure, making them highly effective for direct air carbon capture (DAC).
We are also beginning to study the integration of DAC systems with green hydrogen production to synthesize electrochemical Sustainable Aviation Fuel (eSAF), providing a sustainable alternative for aviation fuel.
Alternatively, CO2 and H2 can be directly hydrogenated into hydrocarbons or converted to methanol, which is subsequently upgraded to aviation fuel.
Recent regulatory developments emphasize the growing importance of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).","Even if emissions were halted immediately, the excess CO2 already present in the atmosphere would continue to contribute to global warming for centuries. This legacy carbon necessitates the deployment of technologies that can actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere, a process known as carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Among the suite of CDR technologies, Direct Air Capture (DAC) stands out as a scalable and targeted approach to directly reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

This escalating urgency to mitigate atmospheric CO2 levels has driven significant advancements in direct air capture (DAC) technologies, particularly in the development and application of molecular sieves tailored for efficient CO2 adsorption. This presentation explores both the synthesis of zeolites, which are a subset of molecular sieves, as well as their performance in DAC systems.

Zeolites are crystalline microporous aluminosilicate materials with a highly regular and tunable pore structure, making them highly effective for direct air carbon capture (DAC). Their unique framework allows for selective adsorption of CO2 over other gases like nitrogen or oxygen, thanks to their surface chemistry and pore size. They are also easily regenerable, as CO2 can be released by altering pressure or temperature, enabling repeated use.

Our research has primarily focused on the experimental evaluation of existing zeolites, particularly spherical molecular sieves derived from them, to enhance their performance in achieving faster, more efficient capture and regeneration cycles. This optimization is key to reducing both operational costs and energy demands. Additionally, we are beginning to investigate the synthesis of zeolites, and by extension, molecular sieves, from volcanic ash, an abundant and sustainable resource in the Canary Islands, to develop a locally sourced solution. To complement these efforts, based on the experimental results, we are designing an integrated DAC system prototype that combines heating for regeneration and cooling within a single integrated unit, enhancing operational efficiency.

We are also beginning to study the integration of DAC systems with green hydrogen production to synthesize electrochemical Sustainable Aviation Fuel (eSAF), providing a sustainable alternative for aviation fuel. By utilizing renewable energy for water electrolysis, green hydrogen can be produced and combined with captured CO2 from the atmosphere to synthesize eSAF. Since Fischer-Tropsch synthesis primarily uses CO and H2, the captured CO2 is first converted into CO via the Reverse Water-Gas Shift (RWGS) reaction, where CO2 reacts with H2 to produce CO and water. The resulting syngas (CO and H2) is then fed into the Fischer-Tropsch process, producing hydrocarbons that can be refined into jet fuel. Alternatively, CO2 and H2 can be directly hydrogenated into hydrocarbons or converted to methanol, which is subsequently upgraded to aviation fuel.

Recent regulatory developments emphasize the growing importance of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative mandates a minimum of 2% SAF usage for flights departing from EU airports starting in 2025, with incremental increases to 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, 34% by 2040, 42% by 2045, and 70% by 2050. These ambitious targets reflect the critical role of SAF in decarbonizing aviation and meeting climate goals.",https://www.egu25.eu/favicon_egu_16x16_.ico,N,,2025-04-07 01:57:00.148947

The International Air Transport Association has officially launched the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Registry, now managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization . This initiative aims to standardize the tracking and reporting of SAF usage, facilitating a global market to expedite the aviation industry's transition toward net-zero emissions by 2050.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is projected to contribute up to 65% of the carbon mitigation required for the aviation sector to achieve its net-zero target. Despite this potential, SAF currently accounts for only about 0.3% of global aviation fuel consumption. The SAF Registry is designed to address this disparity by ensuring that the environmental benefits of SAF are accurately recorded and attributed, promoting increased production and adoption.

Willie Walsh, IATA's Director General, emphasized the registry's role in fostering a transparent and efficient SAF market. He stated that the registry will connect airlines with SAF producers worldwide, ensuring that carriers can access SAF regardless of their location, and producers can reach a broader market. This global approach is expected to stimulate both supply and demand, addressing one of the critical challenges in SAF adoption.

The establishment of CADO to manage the SAF Registry underscores the industry's commitment to decarbonization. CADO, incorporated as a not-for-profit organization in Canada and headquartered in Montreal, aims to provide robust governance for the registry. Membership is open to entities involved in the SAF value chain, including airlines, fuel producers, regulatory bodies, and other stakeholders. This inclusive approach is intended to foster collaboration across the sector, ensuring that all parties contribute to and benefit from the registry's operations.

The SAF Registry offers several key capabilities. It provides a wide geographic scope, allowing airlines to purchase SAF from producers worldwide, with each batch's environmental attributes meticulously tracked and assigned to the purchasing airline. This system ensures accurate reporting of emissions reductions, aligning with international standards and regulatory requirements. Additionally, the registry is designed to be neutral concerning regulations and SAF types, facilitating broad application and compliance with schemes such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

The launch of the SAF Registry comes at a time when the aviation industry faces significant challenges in meeting its sustainability targets. Willie Walsh has previously expressed concerns about the industry's progress toward net-zero emissions, highlighting that efforts are falling behind schedule. He has pointed out that while airlines have committed to these goals, other stakeholders, including fuel suppliers and regulatory bodies, need to play a more active role. Walsh has criticized fuel companies for not fulfilling their SAF supply commitments, noting that airlines are bearing increasing costs as a result.

The SAF Registry is expected to address some of these challenges by providing a transparent and standardized system for tracking SAF transactions. By ensuring that the environmental benefits of SAF are properly recorded and transferred between parties, the registry aims to build confidence among stakeholders and encourage greater investment in SAF production. This, in turn, could help alleviate supply constraints and reduce costs associated with SAF adoption.

In preparation for the registry's launch, IATA released the SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology, developed in collaboration with over 40 airline experts worldwide. This methodology provides a consistent approach to accounting for the environmental benefits of SAF purchases, ensuring transparency and preventing double-counting. It aligns with international protocols and industry best practices, offering guidance for emissions calculations and reporting.

The development of the SAF Registry has garnered support from a broad range of stakeholders. Seventeen airlines, one airline group, six national authorities, three original equipment manufacturers , and one fuel producer have been involved in the registry's development. Notable participants include Singapore Airlines and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore , reflecting the global nature of the initiative.

The aviation industry has been advocating for policies to support SAF production and adoption. IATA has called for measures such as diversifying feedstocks, facilitating co-processing at crude oil facilities, and providing incentives to renewable fuel facilities to encourage them to transition to SAF production. These policies are seen as essential to scaling up SAF production and making it a viable alternative to conventional jet fuel.

I’ve shared my experience of trying to squeeze in a few final Tier Point-earning flights before the change took effect.

My Journey To 35,000 British Airways Tier Points Before March 31, 2025, Program Massacre

My BA flight last Monday posted correctly under the old system. However, an earlier Finnair flight (part of the same itinerary) posted yesterday with bizarre new Tier Points:

British Airways Flight Posting Experience After the Switch from Executive Club to “The Club” with Lifetime Tier Points Conversion

This was the second-to-last leg of a round-the-world trip I booked last year, originating in Cairo at a great price.

Oneworld Business RTW Trip Frequent Flier Program Crediting Dilemma

The Finnair segment should have posted with the same (new) Tier Points as the BA segment—but it didn’t.

To make things even more confusing:

It shows 80 Tier Points earned toward next year’s status (which was the old amount).

Yet the incorrect number of new Tier Points was added to my lifetime tally.

These Tier Points should have been credited to last year’s earnings. That matters, because with just a few more, I could qualify for one more “joker”—a perk that lets you open award inventory even when it’s otherwise unavailable (earned after 6,000 old Tier Points).

The lifetime tally isn’t impacted for me personally, as I’m now over the 550,000 Tier Points required under the new rules. But I’ll never qualify for GGLfL (Gold Guest List for Life); the revenue requirements are, frankly, insane.

The Bigger Problem with Revenue-Based Programs

This is the issue with revenue-based loyalty schemes: you have to micromanage every itinerary to ensure correct crediting. What happened here with Finnair is a perfect example.

UPDATE: Reminder To Audit Your Finnair Flight Postings For Discrepancies: Case Helsinki – Doha (Resolved)

Conclusion

I’m certain I’m not alone—there are likely many “The Club” members who have received too few Avios or Tier Points, just as I’ve been credited with far too many.

If you reissue, change, or encounter irregular operations, revenue-based systems often fail to account for it accurately. You must audit every single flight post to ensure accuracy.

In my case, I received 17,612 excess New Tier Points (at least toward lifetime status). BA also appears unable to properly credit flights taken before April 1 but posted after—leading to major discrepancies across lifetime, last year’s, and current year’s Tier Point balances.

Some major oil companies such as Neste, TotalEnergies, and World Energy have started processing SAF during the past few years, and many more are investing in new biorefineries or converting existing facilities to do the same.

All SAF’s are designed to be drop-in jet fuels, meaning that their chemical compositions are similar to those of conventional fossil-based jet fuels and therefore do not require modifications in aircraft engines or supply infrastructure. However, the fact that the feedstock is non-conventional and frequently bio-based means that some additional requirements are necessary to ensure that the fuels are strictly regulated and fit for purpose.

The HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters & Fatty Acids) production pathway defined in ASTM D7566 Annex 2 is the dominant process used by current commercial-scale SAF producers. This process uses hydrogenation, cracking, and isomerisation to convert vegetable oils, waste oils and residue fats into jet-fuel like molecules. Alternatively, another approved pathway is co-processing defined in ASTM D1655 and Def Stan 91-091, where the same raw bio-ingredients are processed along with conventional crude oils.

When SAF is produced via the HEFA pathway, whether singly or co-processed, the possibility of unconverted esters and fatty acids can impact critical parameters such as thermal stability, low temperature viscosity, or freezing point. Accordingly, these parameters are specifically mentioned as additional requirements in specifications such as D7566 Table A2.1, D1655 Table A1.1, or Def Stan 91-091 Table 3.

Phase Technology’s JFA-70Xi is a three-in-one analyser specifically designed for the jet fuel industry to measure three critical parameters: freezing point according to international test methods IP 435 / ASTM D5972, kinematic viscosity at both -20°C and -40°C according to ASTM D7945, and also density. Together these parameters define the low temperature fluidity of jet fuels, critical to the safe operations of aircraft. The instrument and associated test methods have been approved in applicable global specifications of jet fuels (ASTM D1655 Table 1, ASTM D7566 Table 1, Def Stan 91-091 Annex E).

The key advantage of JFA-70Xi is the ability to measure the three critical parameters in only 15 minutes with best-in-class precision. With the superior advantage of the ASTM D5972/IP 435 automatic freezing point method to detect low levels of incidental materials and other contaminants, it is currently the referee method when SAF is co-processed to ensure that the freezing point will not be negatively impacted by levels of unconverted raw materials (see D1655-20c Table A1.1 note H; or Def Stan 91- 091 Issue 14 Table 3 Note 5). For the required viscosity testing at both -20°C and -40°C of SAF, the ASTM D7945 method is an approved alternate viscosity test method in all of ASTM D1655, ASTM D7566 and Def Stan 91-091 global jet fuel specifications.

Another advantage of JFA-70Xi is the phase plot that is generated for every test, showing the temperature vs. optical signal changes during the cooling and warming cycles.",,N,,2025-04-06 13:56:25.523447

Regional airports and local governments across the country face these continuing challenges.","ALGA News recently sat down with aviation expert and Hales North Managing Director Sara Hales to discuss local government’s key role in the future of regional airports across Australia. Ms Hales highlighted that many regional airports, largely owned by local governments, are facing significant changes and challenges.

ALGA: As you know, local governments manage and maintain many regional airports around the nation. Tell us your thoughts about how the future is looking for these important aviation assets?

Sara Hales (SH): Over the next 20 years, regional airports must deal with unprecedented change. Hundreds of new aircraft types are under development, which range across fuel types, propulsion systems, mission types and crew requirements.

The promise of electric aviation to reduce operational costs suggests a possible resurgence of intra-regional aviation and growth in general aviation. This could drive increased demand on regional airport infrastructure.

However, the mix of fleet will change, and so will customer needs. Consideration must be given to provision of alternative fuels, electric recharging and battery storage, hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel infrastructure. Local governments must also assess the provision of aircraft pavements, movement areas, procedures and airspace protection to support emerging aircraft types.

Many regional airports must navigate these changes with constrained cashflow and often poor financial performance. While vital to their communities – supporting business, trade, investment, health, and emergency services – they often operate at a financial loss.

ALGA: We know councils are at the forefront of climate action so how will this issue affect our airports?

SH: Climate change will continue to impact this sector, presenting both risks and opportunities. Community dependence upon aviation and airport assets will compound as regions deal with increasingly frequent fires, floods and other severe weather impacts. Changing climate conditions will also affect infrastructure lifespan, requiring adaptive planning.

Importantly, the global aviation industry will continue its march towards net zero 2050, driving airports to adapt their asset renewal and investment strategies. Carbon emissions that are free today may come at a cost tomorrow, influencing financial and operational decisions.

Thought must be given to supporting airline customers to decarbonise their operations. Shifts such as move towards electric ground handling equipment, provision of pre-conditioned air and electricity to aircraft on bay, changes to flight procedures to reduce fuel burn and consideration to taxiway gradients that support single engine taxi are all themes that regional airports much seek to accommodate.

ALGA: Gazing into your crystal ball, what does the future of regional aviation look like?

SH: In the future, aviation will likely be more important to more people and communities. Regional aviation will likely increase.

Workforce availability and retention will be ongoing challenges, alongside new responsibilities like carbon accounting and reporting. The geopolitical environment remains uncertain, and long-term capital allocation decisions must factor in emerging risks. Meanwhile, digital transformation will accelerate, with smart technologies like digital twins and Internet of Things (IoT) devices increasingly adopted, and consideration given to heightened cybersecurity threats, including AI-driven risks.

While airports can be costly, they are critical infrastructure and local gateways: difficult to replace and essential to future economic and social wellbeing and community resilience of communities. This is the strategic planning landscape for many regional airports.

ALGA: How can local government manage the financial burden of running these important community assets? How can they improve financial sustainability, enhance climate resilience, support changing customer needs and strengthen community economic and social wellbeing?

SH: Strategic planning considers these impacts in the context of the community the airport serves, identifying opportunities and risks, and aligning infrastructure investment with financial realities.

Strategic planning also involves legacy infrastructure, future proofing assets, optimising operations, and strengthening financial performance through developing productive and collaborative relationships with others. It focuses on leveraging both aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenue, managing risks, attracting investment, and identifying opportunities to improve cash flow.

Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter famously said: “The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do”. This is highly relevant to the airports, which, in our high-cost regulatory environment, cannot afford to be all things to all people.

ALGA: What is your expert advice for councils managing small airports and aerodromes?

SH: By focusing on core strengths and excluding distractions, resources can be effectively allocated to ensure success. A prime example is Virgin Australia’s remarkable turnaround, achieved through strategic clarity and disciplined execution.

Regional airports and local governments across the country face these continuing challenges.

A clear strategic direction, supported by an actionable plan, enhances financial sustainability, informs infrastructure design and supports climate resilience, and community well-being.",https://alga.com.au/app/uploads/cropped-cropped-favicon-2018-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-04-06 05:57:21.021338

Implications for the Aviation Industry

Asiana Airlines and Korean Air’s merger will change the aviation landscape globally.

Increasing Market Share in Asia

The acquisition increases Korean Air’s market dominance in Asia and abroad. Korean Air is better positioned to compete with regional heavyweights like China Eastern Airlines and Japan Airlines. Incheon Airport in Seoul is anticipated to grow in importance as a worldwide hub and play a major part in international travel.

Advantages for Travellers

The merger will have several positive effects on travellers. A larger route network will give travellers more flexibility in terms of timing and connectivity. A wider network of clients can earn and redeem points. Furthermore, by pooling resources, the airline may make investments in modernised fleets, improved lounges, and enhanced in-flight experiences.

International Collaborations and Regulatory Obstacles

The merger’s effects on airline alliances and regulatory issues are important considerations. Asiana is a member of Star Alliance, and Korean Air is a founding member of SkyTeam. The agreement has been closely examined by competition regulators across several nations, who are worried about diminished competition and possible fare hikes. Reduced competition on some routes may help some rivals, but the merged airline will also be in a stronger position to take on leading carriers globally.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cropped-142341008_3736125383109174_8967045553856800325_n.png?fit=32%2C32&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-05 22:56:37.045445

We have got in a bit of a habit of holidaying in Dubai every December. Going away during some of the Christmas chaos and getting some winter sun is perfect for us. We choose Dubai because it isn’t too far away, we can always use companion vouchers (as long as we book 355 days in advance) and we know what we are getting; great food, great service, and perfect weather. I know Dubai is 50/50 with a lot of people but I’m not sure what there isn’t to like when you manage expectations. If you want culture there are plenty of other places. If you want a great winter holiday with guaranteed weather, then the UAE is your place!

For the last few years, we have stayed at Le Royal Meridien (rated 11/850 hotels in Dubai), which is classed as being located in the Dubai Marina, but it is situated directly on JBR Beach too. The location works perfectly for us as Dubai Marina is a great place to explore with many restaurants and shops. It is also easy to access most other areas of Dubai by car. We stayed at the far end of The Palm once at the Waldorf Astoria and it just felt like it was a bit too far to get anywhere. It can sometimes take 20-30 minutes to leave The Palm alone.

Le Royal Meridien has been open since 1994 and is one of the original luxury Dubai hotels. You can tell how old it is purely by the fact that it isn’t a huge high rise and is on such a large plot. The good thing is that it doesn’t feel old; it has had numerous upgrades to the rooms and grounds over the years. It has 504 rooms and suites spread across three buildings. It is a Marriott Hotel and we have used points in the past to upgrade. You can also collect points on all spending in the hotel resort during your stay, which is great as the hotel has 14 different restaurants and bars with varying cuisines and styles.

Check In

The reception area is modern, grand and is always spotlessly clean. Every time we walk into this space for the first time, the very recognisable smell reminds us that we’re back to somewhere very familiar. I love that smell!

One downside to flying to Dubai with British Airways is that the two options of flights leave you checking in at either 2am or 10am. The latter is our preferred time, having had an overnight flight, but it does mean that the room is usually not ready, understandably.

The staff, however, are always very welcoming and helpful. During this stay we had two rooms, and one of them was ready, so we could dump our bags, get changed quickly and go and have a much needed nap by the pool whilst the other room was being prepared.

Room

We have stayed in a few different room types over our years of visiting. We were in the Tower Suites for our first year, which includes club access. However, these rooms have had a very large apartment block built in front of them, restricting nearly all sea views. The next year we booked a club room but asked to stay in the suites at the opposite side, which have refurbished rooms and the best views. This was much better for us, despite the fact that the walk to the club lounge was much longer.

Since having our little boy and travelling with Grandparents, we have opted for a larger, connecting room, which is the Super Deluxe 1 Bedroom Suite with Balcony and it is located in the main building.

A tip for this building is that you need to request to be on the far right hand side (if you are standing out the front of the hotel) as these rooms have the best sea view and you can see the big wheel and part of The Palm.

The room is really lovely and spacious and our favourite room we have stayed in so far. You enter into a main living area with a dining table, sofa area and mini bar/drinks station. To the left is a connecting door to the other room we had and straight ahead leads to a long balcony with the previously mentioned stunning sea views.

The bedroom is separate with a large open space, including a bigger bed which was the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in, a desk, sofa and a large wardrobe area hidden behind a wall behind the bed.

The bathroom is modern with a double sink, and plenty of storage, a bath, roomy shower, toilet and bidet. The amenities are Malin and Goetz, which aren’t my favourite, but they’re still a nice brand.

The house keeping staff need to be mentioned, as they really do an excellent job. We were fully stocked with everything we needed, including more water than we’ll ever need, which is so nice to have readily available.

When we were shown to our room by the check in staff, they did ask us what time of day we would like the rooms cleaned in the morning and for turn down service. I thought this was a really nice touch, however, the message wasn’t passed on. It didn’t bother us, but our house keeping clearly took note of our routine anyway and adapted to when he was fairly certain we wouldn’t be there.

Hotel Grounds

The hotel grounds are immaculately kept and regularly updated. As I mentioned before, the hotel is based on a large plot so everything is a little spaced out which is a good thing and doesn’t bother us at all, but for anybody with mobility issues, or just not that into moving too much on holiday, there is a buggy buzzing around to take you to whichever point you need, and there is never usually a wait for it, you can just ask any member of staff to call it for you wherever you are and it’ll arrive within minutes.

There are three pool areas: main pool, infinity pool and childrens pool. We have found with the pool areas that at the time of year we go, you have to chase the sun a little. The high rise apartment block next door casts shade over all of them in the afternoon.

The water is always a little cooler than we would want it to be as well, despite being advertised as heated. It clearly is but maybe not as much as it could be.

There is also an adults only area that is located on a grass area between the three pools, it is always quite quiet there, which I guess is the point.

We spend nearly all of our time on the beach at this hotel. Le Royal has direct access to Jumeirah Beach with a really large private section. Having walked down the beach many times, we’ve always noted how small the other hotels beach areas are, and the loungers are crammed into row upon row.

Le Royal has such a wide beach area, that they have permanent wooden gazebos for each group of loungers, which is usually four between them. Each gazebo has their own buzzer to be able to buzz for service.

The food and drinks menu on the beach and by the pools is extensive and it is usually very speedy, although we have been at busier times where they haven’t had enough staff and they just can’t keep up with the orders. It’s worth mentioning at this point, though, that the staff are the main reason we keep coming back to this hotel specifically. The service is beyond what we would ever expect, and we are treated so well by each and every member of staff we come across. So many of the staff have been there since we first started going to the hotel, which seems strange in what is usually such a low staff retention industry. From speaking to them, they say that they are very well looked after and you can tell they enjoy their jobs.

One important thing to note about the beach is the noise. There are planes constantly flying overhead as the skydiving centre is directly opposite, and there are two beach clubs to the right of the hotel that play music that gets progressively louder throughout the afternoon. It actually doesn’t bother us at all, it’s nice to have background music, and watching the sky divers all day is pretty entertaining, but I can see how some people would not like it, so if you sit much further over to the left of the beach, you can eliminate some of it.

Restaurants

Originally, when coming to Dubai, we would travel out of the hotel every night and explore all of the amazing (but increasingly expensive) restaurants Dubai has to offer. However, since having our toddler with us, we have been including Half Board to our stay and staying at the hotel for most of our dinners. Now, everybody is different, but we just can’t get on board with a buffet dinner. No matter how good the offering is. When we are on holiday we like dinners to be calm and sociable with great service. The buffet at this hotel, Brasserie 2.0, is very highly regarded, and we do hear good things, but we make the most of our half board by using the dine around option. This means that you can visit almost all of the restaurants in the hotel and they have set menus that are totally included, or you can go a la carte and use AED 150 per person towards your bill. Usually with other hotels, we have found the set menus to be limited and boring; however, at Le Royal, the majority of the time, it includes most of what we would have wanted to order anyway, which makes it a very cost effective way to eat in Dubai. They usually include a few premium orders, which is a nice surprise, so you don’t actually feel like you’re eating off a set menu.

Our favourite restaurants are Zengo, which is Asian cuisine and up there with one of the best Asian restaurants we have been to, La Strega an Italian with fantastic pizza and Geales a British fish restaurant. Unfortunately, on this visit Geales was closed as they are have been refurbishing and rebranding it to The Beam. We are hoping it is just as good as before, because it was an exceptionally good place to eat for not only fresh grilled fish, but really delicious fish and chips.

The Half Board can also be used in restaurants in the sister hotel just behind called Grosvenor House. This hotel is directly on the Dubai Marina and has some really excellent places to eat. Plus there is a free shuttle between the two hotels making it very easy to get to. In fact the Dine Around can be used at over 100 restaurants throughout Dubai.

As far as hotel breakfast buffets go, Le Royal do a very good one. Like a lot of these hotels, it can get very busy, especially at peak times. They have quite a good seating system, which means you never wait too long, but it does still feel a little chaotic. There are multiple stations, from pancakes and waffles, to any egg you want, to Middle Eastern Cuisine, so a huge amount of choice, somewhat overwhelming if you’re anything like me!

When Geales was still open, if you stay in one of the suites you can have your breakfast in there. It is much smaller, with less options, but still plenty for what you need and a much calmer environment. I do hope this will be included as part of the new restaurant.

Other Amenities

During our stays here, we have used the gym quite a lot. It’s a great gym, with a range of equipment and dumbbells up to 48kg, which is a big tick for Eugene. It can get busy first thing in the morning, but never to the point that you can’t do a full workout.

The spa is located near the gym and has recently been upgraded. We didn’t use the spa specifically, but Eugene did have a massage. He said the area was nice and calming. It wasn’t one of the best massages he has ever had, so he didn’t feel like it was excellent value for money, although spa treatments in hotels rarely are.

There is also a beautifully designed Beauty Bar.

I mentioned earlier in my review about the Club Lounge. We haven’t used it for a few years as in the evenings it is Adults Only. I would definitely recommend it if you don’t have kids with you though. You can have your Breakfast there, like Geales, it is much smaller than the main buffet but fully caters for what you would need and is very relaxed. They offer afternoon tea between 3pm and 5pm, we haven’t ever done this, as we like to stay on the beach until much later, but it would be nice if you needed to get out of the sun. The biggest benefit, though is the pre-dinner drinks between 6pm and 8pm. We all know that Dubai is very expensive for alcohol, so Eugene and I used to very much enjoy a couple of drinks before dinner and it felt like we were getting very good value for the extra we had paid for Club access. They also offer a small buffet in the evening of canapes and light bites which some people have told us they can feel like they have had a full dinner from.

The kids club is open 10am to 7pm for children between the ages of 4 and 12. We haven’t been able to use it as our boy is too young, but it looks like a lot of fun and a very safe environment.

Conclusion

We really do have the best time when we stay at Le Royal Meridien. The main reasons are that we feel taken care of by the staff and it’s also the convenience. The fact that it is located so close to Dubai Marina and easy to get to the rest of Dubai is a huge bonus, but also the fact that if you aren’t doing a really long holiday, you don’t need to leave the hotel at all because of the large range of restaurants and the value of the Half Board.

Whilst looking for other hotels in Dubai, we also haven’t seen a beach area that can compete with Le Royal’s unless you go a bit further out.

We are definitely keen to try some other hotels around Dubai, but the key thing for us to beat is the restaurant choice and beach area, so if you have any recommendations, let us know!

Na última sexta-feira (28), ocorreu a primeira reunião técnica do Grupo de Trabalho (GT) de Transportes do BRICS, por videoconferência. O encontro, que reúne representantes do Brasil, Rússia, Índia, China e África do Sul, focou em discussões sobre transporte sustentável e conectividade aérea, alinhando prioridades que serão apresentadas na cúpula prevista para julho, no Rio de Janeiro.

O Ministério de Portos e Aeroportos (MPor) do Brasil destacou suas iniciativas voltadas à sustentabilidade nos modais de transporte, com ênfase na mobilidade urbana. Entre os tópicos em pauta, a redução de gases poluentes e a promoção de energias limpas no setor aéreo foram destacados. O Brasil, que é precursor na produção de combustíveis sustentáveis para aviação, apresentou suas ações, como a implementação de fábricas de petróleo sintético para criar o Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

O GT também discutiu a descarbonização dos portos e do transporte marítimo, propondo a adoção de combustíveis de baixo carbono, alinhando-se assim às metas da Organização Marítima Internacional para diminuir as emissões de Gases de Efeito Estufa (GEEs). Uma das propostas que surgiu foi a criação de um sistema de suprimento energético diretamente dos portos para os navios, uma solução potencial para melhorar a eficiência energética na navegação.

Outro ponto significante da reunião foi a proposta de uma Aliança Logística Internacional do BRICS, destinada a promover uma logística mais ágil e eficaz em situações de emergência humanitária. O grupo se baseou em eventos recentes, como a tragédia no Rio Grande do Sul, para justificar a necessidade de uma resposta mais rápida em situações similares.

Com a presidência brasileira do bloco iniciada em janeiro, o GT de Transportes do BRICS tem mais duas reuniões programadas para abril e maio deste ano, culminando em uma reunião ministerial em Brasília que deve apresentar os resultados alcançados. Esta movimentação pretende preparar o terreno para a 17ª cúpula dos BRICS, que ocorrerá em julho. O Brasil definirá como tema central desta cúpula ""Fortalecendo a Cooperação do Sul Global para uma Governança mais Inclusiva e Sustentável"", buscando consolidar relações exteriores e promover iniciativas de inclusão social e sustentabilidade.

A cúpula não contará apenas com os membros fundadores – Brasil, Rússia, Índia, China e África do Sul – mas também com países convidados como Arábia Saudita, Egito, Emirados Árabes Unidos, Etiópia, Indonésia e Irã, além de diversos outros membros associados que compõem o grupo.

E-Jet SAF meets the specifications of ASTM D7566 Annex A1.
Why choose E-Jet SAF over other SAFs?
Unlike biofuels, which are constrained by land use and deforestation risks, E-Jet SAF is electrochemically produced from CO2, water, and renewable energy.
Twelve aims to produce millions of gallons per year by the end of the decade, partnering with airlines and corporate partners to use E-Jet fuel, E-Jet attributes or SAFc, and E-Naphtha-based chemicals.","Twelve's E-Jet® SAF is a breakthrough for powering sustainable aviation.

What is E-Jet SAF?

E-Jet® fuel is a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), also known as eSAF, made from CO2, water, and renewable energy. It’s drop-in ready for existing aircraft engines and cuts lifecycle emissions by up to 90%, with lower sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate emissions. E-Jet SAF meets the specifications of ASTM D7566 Annex A1.

Why choose E-Jet SAF over other SAFs?

Unlike biofuels, which are constrained by land use and deforestation risks, E-Jet SAF is electrochemically produced from CO2, water, and renewable energy. Compared to biofuels, it uses up to 1,000 times less water and 30 times less land, with up to 30% more reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions compared to bio-based SAF.

E-Jet SAF allows airlines and travelers alike to significantly decrease their emissions now without having to retrofit planes and supply chains.

What does E-Jet SAF cost?

Powered by clean energy, E-Jet® SAF will become cost-competitive with conventional, petroleum-based jet fuel once it reaches full scale.

Is E-Jet SAF in production?

In July 2023, construction began at Twelve’s AirPlant™ One facility in Moses Lake, WA. Once operational, it will be the first commercial-demonstration scale E-Jet SAF plant.

E-Jet production will start in 2025, with an initial capacity of up to 50,000 gallons/year.

How fast can E-Jet SAF production scale?

Twelve aims to produce millions of gallons per year by the end of the decade, partnering with airlines and corporate partners to use E-Jet fuel, E-Jet attributes or SAFc, and E-Naphtha-based chemicals.

What are the barriers to scaling?

Scaling requires access to affordable clean energy (solar, wind, hydro), biogenic or direct air capture CO2 sources, and innovative project financing partners to unlock the next generation of fuels to power the industrial transformation.

How impactful is E-Jet SAF?

E-Jet® SAF has far lower lifecycle emissions than other fuels.

Learn more:Know Your SAF: Guide to Sustainable Aviation Fuels.

Conventional jet fuel: 11.9 kg CO2e/gal

Alcohol to Jet (SAF): 3.3 - 8.8 kg CO2e/gal

E-Jet® SAF: 0.6 - 2.0 kg CO2e/gal

What is Twelve’s impact on global emissions?

Twelve’s carbon transformation technology has the potential to cut up to 10% of global emissions, including 50% of hard-to-decarbonize industrial emissions. At full deployment, it could address 2-3 gigatonnes of CO2 per year.

Who are Twelve's customers?

Twelve is proud to partner with Alaska Airlines, Boston Consulting Group, International Airlines Group, Shopify, and more.

Interested in partnering? Contact us here.

How can corporate customers purchase SAF credits from Twelve to offset operational/travel emissions?

Corporate customers can directly contact Twelve to purchase sustainable aviation fuel credits (SAFc) to offset their scope 3 emissions, i.e. operational and/or travel footprint. These credits are transferred to the customers once the E-Jet fuel that is associated with the credit purchase has been used by an airline. Alternatively, corporate customers can jointly purchase E-Jet fuel in partnership with any airline of their choice and retire the credits as needed. Twelve works with industry-leading registries like the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance and the International Air Transport Association to transfer the credits to customers with lifecycle traceability.

Malaysia Airlines issued a press statement announcing a loss of contact with the plane.","The infamous lost Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has captivated many globally since the disappearance of a passenger jet on March 8, 2014. Now, over a decade later, the ongoing investigation has been temporarily suspended until the end of 2025.

Search Suspended due to Weather Complications

After an inconclusive initial four-year investigation, Ocean Infinity announced plans to resume the search for the missing flight in December of 2024. A few months since the promise of further exploration, the search has been put on pause due to weather limitations affecting the search area of the Indian Ocean.

“Right now it’s not the season” stated Malaysian Government Transport Minister, Anthony Loke. “I think they have stopped the operation for the time being and will resume the search at the end of this year”.

Loke made the statement at a press conference held at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, following the arrival of airline British Airways’ first flight to Malaysia after reinstating their Kuala Lumpur route.

A Timeline of Missing Flight MH370 – A Decade of Limited Discovery

Despite undergoing the largest search in aviation history, the missing Boeing 777 which carried 239 passengers is yet to be found. Here is a short summary of what we know after a decade of search efforts.

2014: Disappearance and Initial Search

On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 departed from Kuala Lumpur at 00:42 local time, set to land in Beijing. The last known voice contact records the aircraft’s captain stating “Good night, Malaysian Three Seven Zero”. Two hours after takeoff, the airline lost contact with the aircraft, and it had vanished from civilian radar. Malaysia Airlines issued a press statement announcing a loss of contact with the plane.

Search and rescue operations began, concentrating on the South China Sea and the Straits of Malacca. By the end of the following day, more than 40 aircraft and 24 vessels from several nations were contributing to the search. On March 10, the Royal Malaysian Air Force confirms the flight made a “turn back”.

As the search and rescue phase turned to efforts of search and recovery, a series of investigations were undertaken. A sonar search of the seafloor began on April 14 and concluded on May 28, finding no debris.

2015 – 2017: The Search Continues and Draws to a Close

Underwater searches continued to take place, and by January 28, 2015 after countless speculation, Malaysia declares the disappearance an accident.

After finding unrelated debris on Reunion Island, debris confirmed to be from the missing aircraft is found on the islands of Pemba and Mauritius in September and October of 2016. However, the discovery of this debris did not result in uncovering the location of the main body of underwater wreckage. The underwater search came to an end in January 2017.

2018 – Today: Private Company Ocean Infinity conducts Series of Searches

Searches resume in January 2018 under private company Ocean Infinity who agree upon a “no find, no fee” arrangement with Malaysia.

These efforts concluded in June 2018. The search was again announced to resume in December 2024, and is now on pause due to weather conditions.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/eugene-butler.jpg,N,,2025-04-05 18:56:11.824594

Going forward, retail success will depend on adopting a scalable, digital infrastructure capable of evolving alongside changing sustainability and compliance demands.","As governments enact sweeping regulations to eliminate forced labor, child exploitation, and environmental abuses, companies are under growing pressure to take full responsibility for every link in their global sourcing networks. From the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) to America’s Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), these laws are reshaping how businesses monitor and verify the conditions under which products are made. Combined with increasing consumer demand for transparency on human rights and environmental practices, these forces are driving a fundamental shift in how companies oversee their supply chains. To navigate this new landscape, companies must embrace advanced digital tools that enable real-time visibility and accountability at every level of their supply chains. Increasingly, these tools extend beyond raw material sourcing to offer full visibility across a product’s entire life cycle, from design and production to delivery and disposal, enabling brands to address sustainability and labor concerns from start to finish.

Technology is making it possible to achieve the level of oversight that regulators and consumers now demand. Multi-enterprise supply chain platforms and new artificial intelligence innovations are playing an increasingly pivotal role in monitoring supplier networks, ensuring compliance, and mitigating risks before they escalate into legal or reputational crises. These tools offer capabilities that traditional compliance methods never could. Rather than relying on periodic audits that provide only a limited snapshot of a supplier’s conditions, AI enables continuous monitoring, alerting companies to potential labor violations in real time. With an estimated 50 million people trapped in modern slavery worldwide, including 28 million in forced labor, proactive oversight is critical.

While all industries are susceptible to labor abuses, fashion is uniquely vulnerable to them. The U.S. Department of Labor has identified countries including India, Turkey, China, Vietnam, Azerbaijan, Benin, Brazil, and Egypt as high-risk areas for child labor, particularly in the production of cotton and leather. Given the prevalence of child labor – 160 million children globally, according to the International Labor Organization – brands cannot afford to ignore what’s happening in the deeper tiers of their supply chains. AI-driven supply chain mapping tools help solve this problem by tracing every component back to its origin, identifying all parties involved in production, including subcontractors, and flagging any links to suppliers that have been associated with forced labor or environmental violations.

AI and automation are proving to be indispensable for achieving compliance at scale. By analyzing massive datasets, AI can detect anomalies that might indicate exploitative practices, such as sudden fluctuations in labor costs or unusual supplier turnover rates. These red flags allow brands to take corrective action before violations escalate into full-blown crises.

AI-powered document verification also streamlines compliance by building a complete chain of custody for each item and ensuring that suppliers’ certifications are legitimate, reducing the risk of fraudulent claims about ethical sourcing practices. These capabilities are critical as bad actors continue to falsify sustainability credentials, making it difficult for brands to separate trustworthy suppliers from those merely paying lip service to ethical sourcing.

Beyond regulatory compliance, investing in AI-driven traceability solutions is becoming a strategic imperative for brands looking to build consumer trust. Studies show that 66% of U.S. consumers consider sustainability when making a purchase, and many are willing to switch brands based on sustainability practices. Companies that can offer proof of ethical sourcing will gain a competitive edge, while those that fail to do so risk losing consumer confidence. The need for more sophisticated supply chain monitoring will only grow as new regulations come into force and consumer expectations continue to rise. AI’s role in this space will expand beyond compliance and risk mitigation to include predictive capabilities that help companies make smarter sourcing decisions. AI is increasingly able to anticipate potential disruptions, helping companies adjust their sourcing strategies in real time. The most forward-thinking brands are already leveraging AI to enhance their sustainability efforts, using machine learning to optimize procurement decisions, reduce waste, and lower their overall environmental footprint.

Leading supply chain platforms are integrating these AI-driven solutions into a single, seamless system that manages everything from supplier onboarding to compliance verification. These capabilities help companies monitor supplier risk, analyze compliance documents, and track the chain of custody for each order, creating a verifiable record of responsible sourcing.

Accountability in supply chains is intensifying. Governments are cracking down on unethical sourcing, and consumers are demanding greater transparency. The companies that embrace AI and traceability solutions now will be best positioned to thrive in this new reality. Companies that delay adoption, however, will find themselves vulnerable to regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and lost consumer trust.

“If a palm oil company is valorizing and upcycling palm biomass, it should be recognized and credited for such initiatives.","As Africa's palm oil industry continues to expand, innovative approaches to sustainability are becoming increasingly vital. Eur Ing Hong Wai Onn—a chartered chemical engineer, chartered environmentalist, and founder of the Research Institute for Sustainable Excellence and Leadership (RISEL), offers groundbreaking insights into how biomass valorization could revolutionize the sector across the continent.

Converting Agricultural Waste into Economic Opportunity

“We cannot continue to view palm biomass as waste,” Hong emphasizes. “Every strand of fiber, every discarded fruit bunch represents an untapped opportunity for innovation and sustainability.”

This perspective is particularly relevant for Nigeria, Ghana, and Ivory Coast, where palm oil production continues to grow as a vital economic sector. By implementing biomass valorization technologies, these countries could transform what is currently considered waste into valuable resources, effectively creating new revenue streams while simultaneously addressing environmental concerns.

A Dual Approach to Climate Mitigation

Hong's advocacy for biomass valorization extends beyond economic benefits to offer a concrete pathway for emissions reduction. “Biomass valorization is not just an industrial solution,” he explains, “it's a pathway to reducing carbon emissions and breaking our dependence on fossil fuels.”

The conversion of palm oil biomass into ethanol presents particularly promising opportunities. This bioethanol can be blended with conventional fuels, reducing fossil fuel consumption, or further upgraded through the Alcohol-to-Jet pathway to create Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

“This alternative route is becoming increasingly important,” Hong notes, “as the current focus on the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids pathway will eventually face feedstock limitations.” With used cooking oil supplies becoming fully utilized, ethanol derived from palm biomass offers a more scalable and sustainable alternative for SAF production.

Beyond Ethanol: Diversifying Value-Added Products

The potential for biomass valorization extends beyond ethanol. Empty fruit bunches can also be processed into butanol, which serves as a drop-in fuel for maritime applications. Research in this area has advanced beyond laboratory and pilot stages, with plans for semi-commercial production plants already underway.

For African palm oil producers, these developments represent an opportunity to leapfrog traditional production methods and establish more advanced, environmentally conscious industries from the outset.

Strengthening Sustainability Standards

Hong has played a key role in shaping the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) Standards. His deep insights and extensive experience, particularly in the upstream sector, have been instrumental in strengthening Malaysia's sustainability framework.

“I see MSPO as on par with internationally recognized certification standards like the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). In fact, MSPO certification is mandatory in Malaysia, meaning that every single drop of palm oil produced in the country is sustainably certified,” he emphasizes. His commitment to advancing environmental and industry standards offers valuable insights for African producers developing their own frameworks.

Hong acknowledges that continuous improvement in standards is essential. “No standard is perfect or time-resistant. Continuous improvement is necessary, which is why standards need to be reviewed regularly,” he explains. One key area for enhancement could be strengthening carbon emissions accounting and carbon footprint reporting. “If a palm oil company is valorizing and upcycling palm biomass, it should be recognized and credited for such initiatives. Perhaps certification systems could explore closer collaboration with carbon credit mechanisms to incentivize sustainable practices,” he suggests.

Hong's recognition as the first Malaysian engineer granted the Freedom of the City of London underscores the global significance of his work. This honor reflects not just individual achievement, but the potential of sustainable development to transcend national boundaries.

The Freedom of the City of London is one of the oldest surviving traditional ceremonies still in existence today, and it has been bestowed upon notable figures such as Sir Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela. Being admitted into this esteemed group places Hong among a distinguished list of individuals who have made impactful contributions to society, highlighting the international resonance of his efforts in advancing sustainability and engineering excellence.

Overcoming Implementation Challenges

Despite its potential, biomass valorization faces hurdles in implementation. “The high capital investment required can be a barrier at this stage,” Hong acknowledges. However, with economies of scale and appropriate government support, these obstacles can be overcome.

“Imagine a scenario where ethanol blending in petrol is mandated, and domestically produced ethanol from biomass qualifies for double-counting due to its low carbon intensity,” he suggests. “This could elevate ethanol prices to a level where biomass valorization becomes commercially attractive.”

Such policies would simultaneously reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lower the carbon footprint of palm oil industries—""a classic case of killing two birds with one stone,” as Hong puts it.

A Vision for Africa's Palm Oil Future

Through RISEL, Hong Wai Onn continues to advocate for sustainable development approaches that could be transformative for Africa's agricultural sectors. “It's certainly not an easy journey,” he concludes. “We're paving the way for a new model of sustainable industrial development—one that supports nations in accelerating their progress toward net-zero emissions targets.”

For African palm oil producers, this vision offers a compelling alternative to conventional development paths—one that transforms environmental challenges into economic opportunities while positioning the continent's palm oil industry at the forefront of sustainable innovation.",https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/RnIktkqTURBXy82ZjQ0ZmRlYTUwYTI3ZjUzNTA1ZWNiZTQ4NzZmYTAyMi5qcGVnkpUDAADNA_HNAjiTBc0EsM0Cdg,N,,2025-04-05 14:56:28.947486

Dreams of the sparkling green hydrogen industry of the future are withering on the vine in the US, but they are still alive and kicking in other parts of the world. The EU, for example, is vigorously pursuing new opportunities to import the stuff from other countries. Too bad President Trump has blown up a chance for US producers to get a piece of the action, but them’s the breaks.

Pro tip: Next time, don’t vote for the convicted felon.

Green Hydrogen Imports Coming To The EU

Green hydrogen fans have had a tough row to hoe. The industry is still in the early stages, with stubbornly high costs, supply chain gaps, shifting public policies, and buyer resistance among the factors leading some stakeholders to pull back or leave the business altogether.

Still, the nations of Europe are among those depending on green hydrogen to decarbonize heavy industries. The additional attraction of pushing Russia out of the EU energy import picture is also at work.

In addition to domestic production, the EU is leaning on overseas markets to feed its green hydrogen hunger. Among the opportunities to surface on the CleanTechnica radar, Canada is laying plans to export its green hydrogen to Europe through Belgium, and stakeholders in northern Africa are eyeballing a pipeline to the EU through Italy.

In other news, Bloomberg reports that TotalEnergies is planning to import green hydrogen from Brazil to supply its petroleum refineries in Europe.

Then there’s Ukraine, which not a member of the EU — yet. The country officially became a candidate for EU accession in 2022, after Russia’s unprovoked invasion. Ukraine has an ample supply of wind and solar power, as well as copious stocks of biomass for producing green hydrogen. Even with the war raging into its fourth year, Ukraine is still pursuing plans to export hydrogen to the EU through an existing network of pipelines that sprawls around Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Austria, and Germany.

Another Loss For US, Another Gain For EU

The leading green hydrogen producer Air Liquide caused many a tear to shed in the US when it announced a pullback on its green hydrogen commitments. The French firm was initially involved in six new Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs organized through the US Department of Energy in 2023.

The Hydrogen Hubs program was funded by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law with a stipulation to include natural gas with carbon capture, as well as renewables. The law is the law, but the Republican majority in Congress has refused to hold Trump to any law, preferring to dump its responsibilities onto the judicial branch. As a result, nothing was done to stop Trump from suspending the program after he took office on January 20.

Air Liquide, for one, saw the writing on the wall. In February, the company let word slip that it is still committed to the two hubs that incorporate natural gas. However, the company adopted a wait-and-see stance on the other four hubs, in consideration of the abrupt shift in federal energy policy.

But, that was not the end of the green hydrogen story for Air Liquide. Last month the company resurfaced with plans for a 200-megawatt electrolyzer project in Rotterdam and a 250-megawattt facility in the Netherlands. Both projects are aimed at supplying green hydrogen for heavy duty transportation and other industrial uses, in addition to supplying TotalEnergies’ refineries.

Yet Another Green Hydrogen Loss For The US

The similarly named firm Air Products also packed up and took its business elsewhere after Trump took office, though for other reasons. On February 24 the Pennsylvania-based company with a global reach announced that it is shelving plans to build a 35-tonne-per-day liquid green hydrogen facility in Massena, New York, citing an unfavorable decision regarding tax credits and “slower than expected development of a hydrogen mobility market in the region.”

In the same announcement, Air Products also bailed on a sustainable aviation fuel project in California and a carbon monoxide project in Texas. “The decision to exit these three projects will streamline our backlog and focus Company resources on projects that drive value for Air Products’ shareholders,” the company explained.

Among those other value-driving projects is the company’s massive green hydrogen facility in Saudi Arabia, attached to the country’s ambitious NEOM planned city. “The NEOM green hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia is approaching 80 percent completion, with green ammonia production expected to commence at the end of 2026,” Air Products notes.

Saudi Arabia has already lined up Germany as an off-taker for its green hydrogen. Word of the deal with Germany surfaced in February, and last week it became official.

The Electrolyzer Angle

In another interesting development, on April 1 Reuters was among the news organizations reporting that Belgium tasked its Monarch, King Philippe, to travel to Vietnam with a large entourage for some deal-making in a number of areas including green hydrogen.

The leading Belgian electrolyzer firm John Cockerill took a preliminary step towards investing in a Vietnamese electrolyzer factory during the trip. “A spokesman for the Belgian firm said the agreements were the first step for a possible investment in a Vietnam factory to manufacture pressurised alkaline water electrolysers,” Reuters reported.

As for why all this overseas outreach is going on, that’s easy. There are not enough domestic projects in the pipeline to meet the EU’s ambitious green hydrogen targets.

The US-based energy transition think tank RMI ran the numbers and produced a report last month noting as much. “Executing this vision has proved difficult, with many early expectations — such as rapid progress, cost reductions, and broad offtake applications — now proven to be overly ambitious or unattainable in the short term,” RMI observed.

To get back on track, RMI advises drawing back on the idea of deploying green hydrogen for “low-impact” uses, like heating buildings or fueling light-duty vehicles, and focus instead on priority areas. “Public and private investments should be directed to steelmaking, fertilizers, refining, aviation, and shipping; sectors where hydrogen provides the most decarbonization value,” RMI states.

“Allocating resources to low-impact uses like heating and light-duty vehicles represents inefficient use of scarce public funds and risks delaying necessary transitions through electrification and energy efficiency measures,” they emphasize.

“It’s time to retire any lingering misconceptions of hydrogen as a Swiss army knife for economy-wide decarbonization,” they add for good measure.

RMI also indicates that the EU will have to import green hydrogen in order to meet its near-term goals, which it is doing. If you can guess how much of that imported product will come from the US, drop a note in the comment thread.

Aviation is a hard-to-abate industry, meaning that it is difficult to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with aviation activities. However, airlines around the globe are increasingly incorporating SAF into their fuel mixes to reduce emissions, with many planning to significantly increase the use of SAF in the coming decades. To achieve this, governments and private companies must invest heavily in SAF research and development, as well as production, to advance the industry in line with aviation decarbonization targets.

SAF is an alternative to conventional, petroleum-based jet fuel, produced using non-petroleum feedstocks. It can be blended with jet fuel, with limits between 10 to 50 percent at present, to help reduce aircraft emissions. More than 360,000 commercial flights have used SAF at 46 different airports, mainly in the United States and Europe, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Aviation continues to contribute around 2.5 percent of all carbon emissions and 12 percent of the CO2 emissions from the transport industry. The ICAO aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which it will achieve primarily by increasingly using SAF to fuel flights. The 2021 Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge brings together multiple U.S. federal agencies for the purpose of expanding domestic SAF consumption to 3 billion gallons in 2030 and 35 billion gallons in 2050.

Some of the feedstocks used to produce SAF include the food and yard waste portion of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, and fats, greases, or oils. SAF production is in the early stage of development, and there are only three known commercial producers in the U.S. at present; World Energy, Neste, and Montana Renewables LLC.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could contribute around 65 percent of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The IATA expects new technology, electric and hydrogen, to contribute 13 percent of this reduction, infrastructure and operational efficiencies 3 percent, and offsets and carbon capture 19 percent. However, achieving this will require the significant scaling of production, which is expected in the late 2030s, as SAF becomes competitive with fossil kerosene and credible offsets become scarcer.

While there are high hopes for SAF to help decarbonize the aviation industry, a 2024 report from the think tank The Institute for Policy Studies found that the SAF industry is lagging behind climate targets. The report showed that there was “no realistic or scalable alternative” to conventional kerosene-based jet fuels and said SAF are well off track to replace them within the timeframe required to avert dangerous climate change, despite public subsidies. The report stated, “While there are kernels of possibility, we should bring a high level of scepticism to the claims that alternative fuels will be a timely substitute for kerosene-based jet fuels.”

Chuck Collins, the co-author of the report, said, “To bring these fuels to the scale needed would require massive subsidies, the trade-offs would be unacceptable and would take resources aware from more urgent decarbonisation priorities.” Collins added, “It’s a huge greenwashing exercise by the aviation industry. It’s magical thinking that they will be able to do this.”

In the U.K., 50 percent of all agricultural land would need to be given up to sustain current flight passenger levels if jet fuel was entirely replaced, according to the report. This demonstrates the significant difficulties in scaling SAF production.

By 2030, global demand for SAF is expected to reach 17 million tonnes per year, equivalent to between 4 to 5 percent of total jet fuel consumption, according to the World Economic Forum. This would require an estimated $19 to $45 billion in investment to achieve.

However, while some regions of the world are falling behind, others are making strides in SAF development. In Asia, the SAF supply is expected to outpace regional demand in 2025 and 2026 as new production facilities open. This is expected to drive down prices, something the aviation industry has long been waiting for. At least five SAF projects in Asia, outside of China, have commenced or are expected to start production this year. However, the compulsory use of SAF in the jet fuel mix is currently non-existent across Asia, with the first compulsory use of SAF beginning in 2026, as Singapore and Thailand enforce a 1 percent mandate. South Korea will introduce a 1 percent SAF mix in 2027, and Japan has a 10 percent mandate for 2030.

There are high hopes for the expansion of the SAF industry and the increased use of SAF in the aviation fuel mix. The growth in SAF production is expected to support the decarbonization of the hard-to-abate aviation industry in the coming decades. However, while the aviation sector is optimistic about this shift, others are more doubtful that SAF can be scaled at the level required to significantly drive down emissions.

Motives for the Choice

Several reasons are thought to be behind the airline’s plan to reduce French flight routes.

Rise in operating expenses

The growing expense of operating in France is one of the main elements determining Ryanair’s choice. Budget air travel has become less affordable due to new environmental charges on airline tickets imposed by the French government. Furthermore, rising fuel prices and airport taxes have made the economy more difficult for low-cost airlines like Ryanair.

Difficulties with Regulation

France’s stringent labour rules have caused conflict between Ryanair and regulatory bodies in the past. In France, airlines must adhere to strict employment laws, which raise staffing costs and increase the risk of labour strike interruptions.

Strikes by Air Traffic Control (ATC)

In recent years, France has experienced several air traffic control strikes that have caused several flight cancellations and delays. Due to these disruptions, Ryanair, one of the biggest low-cost airlines in Europe, has been disproportionately impacted, resulting in enormous financial losses and unhappy customers. The airline has advocated for reforms throughout Europe on several occasions to stop national ATC strikes from impacting aircraft that are merely flying over France.

The Influence of Competition

Even though Ryanair dominates the European low-cost travel market, it faces fierce competition from EasyJet, Transavia, and Vueling. Ryanair may find it more difficult to uphold its low-cost business model while adhering to local laws and taxes in France amid rising competition.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ryanair.jpg?fit=1024%2C603&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-05 13:56:50.376186
