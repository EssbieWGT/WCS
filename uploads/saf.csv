United & Neste: Growing Together Neste has been supplying SAF to United at O’Hare since August 2024 and provided the alternative fuel to UA’s fleet at SFO over the past as well.
The airline burned 4,300 metric tons (13 million gallons) of SAF last year, when only two major hubs were using the alternative fuel.
As small as 13 million gallons may be by comparison, it is still a huge leap forward in progress compared to previous years.
Neste’s global SAF production capability is 1.5 million tons (515 million gallons) per year, and the company projects it will grow to 2.2 million tons (750 million gallons) by the end of 2027.","In the Summer of 2025, United Airlines (UA) and Neste brought sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to these three airports for the first time: Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in New Jersey, and Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) in Washington, DC. The partnership represents the first time that any airline has operated to the three hubs, flying on SAF.

The new locations build on the successful SAF operations at Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD) and San Francisco International Airport (SFO) where Neste has been supplying UA since last year. The term of the SAF contract at IAH is until the end of this month, while EWR and IAD are scheduled for SAF flights until next year.

United & Neste: Growing Together

Neste has been supplying SAF to United at O’Hare since August 2024 and provided the alternative fuel to UA’s fleet at SFO over the past as well. At SFO, the California state government’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) is supporting the use of renewable fuels, which both incentivizes carriers and helps offset development costs for suppliers.

United has been happy with the results and takes the top spot for SAF operators in America. The airline burned 4,300 metric tons (13 million gallons) of SAF last year, when only two major hubs were using the alternative fuel. The contribution of major carriers like UA toward emissions reduction is key to lowering the 2-3% of greenhouse gases that air transport accounts for worldwide.

The global commercial aviation industry uses about 4.3 billion gallons of fuel per year, according to the World Economic Forum. As small as 13 million gallons may be by comparison, it is still a huge leap forward in progress compared to previous years. United Chief Sustainability Officer, Lauren Riley, was quoted in a Neste press release regarding the expanded SAF supply agreement:

“United remains the leading SAF user in the US… we recognize that the growth of the SAF market requires support from both state and federal governments.”

Cleaning Skies By Burning Trash

Neste’s MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel is blended with conventional jet fuel before use and is currently certified for use at up to a 50% ratio. Neste uses 100% renewable raw materials to make its SAF product, including used cooking oil and animal fat waste. The alternative jet fuel has been shown to reduce carbon emissions by as much as 80%, when used unblended. The cost is much higher than conventional jet fuel, which is why government incentives are key to increasing adoption.

Currently, SAF can cost anywhere from 2–5 times the price of conventional jet fuel. Despite that high price tag, United has been saying since at least 2021 that it is pursuing emissions reduction of 100% by 2050. The airline has publicly stated on numerous occasions that it believes SAF is a better option for the environment than buying offsets, which are “emissions credits,” and it believes that the industry would have a strong appetite for the product if made readily available.

Neste Is Ramping Up

United’s “Good Leads The Way” brand campaign specifically focuses on promoting SAF use as part of a drive to do the right thing for customers, employees, communities and the planet. The low global supply is a significant roadblock to widespread adoption, and partnerships like UA and Neste are helping to bring down prices and increase supply through joint development.

Neste’s global SAF production capability is 1.5 million tons (515 million gallons) per year, and the company projects it will grow to 2.2 million tons (750 million gallons) by the end of 2027. Using waste is the ideal source of raw material to create SAF, but it is also in demand by other industry sectors.

On top of the existing financial barrier, should it be necessary to generate the base material for SAF refinement, costs will go up again. United is pushing to raise the visibility of how beneficial SAF is in the near and long-term goal of reducing aviation emissions, with the goal of encouraging the government and wider industry to help facilitate faster mass production and widespread SAF usage.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/014-united-airlines-boeing-737-800-phuong-d-nguyen-_-shutterstock.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-25 12:01:11.876265

The aerospace industry is a highly globalised, supplier-driven, and concentrated sector, dominated by Boeing and Airbus in large civil aircraft, with emerging competitors in regional aircraft markets.

Malaysia has advanced in manufacturing components and in Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) through several policy interventions, institutional and infrastructural support. Of these, Industry Collaboration Programmes have helped to promote local content, technology transfer, and domestic supplier development.

The sector has over 240 firms, concentrated in MRO and manufacturing, but weak in design and development.

Exports are important; manufactured aerospace products are meant for exports, as part of the global supply chain. In 2024, Malaysia exported RM5.74 billion in aerospace products but imported RM14.9 billion, reflecting a continued trade deficit. US is important both as export destination and import source. Foreign investment has recently overtaken domestic investment in this sector.

While Malaysia faces several challenges in the future development of this sector, such as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) compliance, technology and talent gaps, as well as external headwinds under Trump’s tariffs, there is potential for developing Sustainable Aviation Fuel from the available feedstocks to reduce the carbon footprint and competitiveness of this sector.

INTRODUCTION

Aerospace is a globalised industry; it relies on global collaboration across the value chain to stay competitive. International partnerships enable prime contractors to cut costs, leverage supplier expertise, and concentrate on high-value activities such as design, assembly, and marketing. However, the aerospace value chain is supplier driven, as it relies on costly advanced technologies controlled by a few firms that decide who get to participate in the value chain. Low production volumes and high regulatory costs further restrict entry into manufacturing, leaving location decisions in the hands of a small group of companies. Thus, the industry remains highly concentrated. Globally, only Boeing and Airbus can design and produce large civil passenger aircraft in both single and twin-aisle segments, dominating the market through their supply chains.[1] While Boeing and Airbus also supply defence aircraft, other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for defence include BAESystems, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon. Competition in the commercial aircraft market is growing; a few other firms, such as Bombardier (Canada), Embraer (Brazil), Comac (China), Sukhoi/Irkut (Russia), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (Japan), are seeking entry into the large aircraft segment, although they are more focussed on smaller regional aircraft.

Developing countries participate in the global value chain of the aerospace industry by joining some segments of the global value chain, such as the manufacture of aeroplane parts, Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO), or comprehensive servicing of aircraft. MRO processes are vital for ensuring equipment safety, efficiency, and longevity, preventing costly breakdowns, and supporting overall business operations. Key participants now include China, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, and South Korea.

This essay traces the development of the aerospace sector in Malaysia, which is driven by policies and policy intervention. It outlines the performance of the sector and the key challenges it faces going forward.

DEVELOPMENT OF AEROSPACE IN MALAYSIA

The value chain for this sector is illustrated in Figure 1. There are recognisably five stages involved: design and development; component production; sub-assembly; final assembly; and post-production services, which include maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), technical training, and customer support.

POLICIES DRIVING SECTORAL DEVELOPMENT

The aerospace sector was identified as strategic in the National Aerospace Blueprint (NAB) 1997, which targeted world-class standards by 2015 in four areas: parts and components manufacturing, maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), avionics and systems integration, and aerospace training.

This vision was expanded in the Malaysian Aerospace Industry Blueprint (MAIB) 2030, launched in 2015.[3] MAIB aims to position Malaysia as Southeast Asia’s leading aerospace nation and a key regional hub by 2030, with projected revenue of RM55.2 billion and over 32,000 high-income jobs. It aims to achieve this through upgrading the competitiveness of local players, changing from being a technology user to technology supplier by investing in R&D, increasing local content, moving to the upstream market, prioritising local design and engineering, and staying ahead of regional competitors for parts and components sourcing.

An important complementary policy for increasing local content is the Industrial Collaboration Program (ICP) introduced in 2014 as an offset policy requiring foreign firms in government tenders to support local development.[4] In aerospace, the ICP promotes local content, technology transfer, and supplier growth through partnerships, local operations, and training programmes. Linked to major procurements (e.g., Rolls-Royce Trent engines, BAE Hawk aircraft), it has enhanced Malaysia’s capabilities in component manufacturing, MRO, and advanced technologies such as 3D printing.

The importance of the aerospace sector is reiterated in subsequent policy documents such as NIMP2030, and the 12th and 13th Malaysia Plans. The targets set out in MAIB 2030 were reiterated in NIMP 2030 (Table 1), while the 12th and 13th Malaysia Plans continued to support these goals. The 2025 targets were set by NIMP2030, while MAIB 2030 set targets for only 2030. The 13th Malaysia Plan expanded the scope of this sector; it identifies unmanned aircraft system and advanced air mobility (AAM) as high impact strategic sectors within the aerospace sector. It further includes a new aspiration, which is to establish Malaysia as the ASEAN hub for sustainable aviation, focussing on the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and low-carbon aviation fuels.

Table 1. Targets of the Aerospace Industry by sub-sectors

Other than the sub-sectoral targets, Malaysia also aims to earn RM55.2 billion in revenue from this sector by 2030. It also aims to produce 32,000 relevant highly skilled workers by 2030.

These policies are accompanied by financial support, infrastructure, and institutional support. Unfortunately, there is practically no data on the financial support for aerospace development. It was reported that RM100 million had been allocated for aerospace industry development programmes during the 12th Malaysia Plan.[5]

Infrastructure support came in the form of the development of the Subang Aerotech Park, which was built out of the old Subang airport. The park is a dedicated industrial aviation park built by two GLCs, Malaysia Airports and Boustead, to develop an aerospace ecosystem.[6] Likewise, KLIA Aeropolis was being developed to support MRO, aeronautical development and to be a hub for aerospace manufacturing.[7]

Several institutions were established to oversee the development of the sector. The Malaysian Aerospace Council (MAC) was established in 2001. It is chaired by the Minister of International Trade & Industry (MITI) and provides the vision and direction for the overall development plan of the national aerospace industry. This comes in the form of policy guidelines and priority areas of aerospace activities. Members of the Council consists of Government and industry players.

To further support the aerospace industry, a National Aerospace Industry Coordinating Office (NAICO) was established in August 2015 as a Unit under MITI. The main role of NAICO is to ensure that the Blueprint’s strategies and initiatives are implemented. It also acts as a central hub connecting industry players, government bodies, and academia to jointly enhance the strength and capacity of Malaysia’s aerospace sector.

The organisation was established as a corporation on October 18, 2022, by MITI to spearhead the development of Malaysia’s aerospace industry by leading in the implementation of the MAIB 2030. It also fosters collaborations with the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to enhance Malaysia’s aerospace supply chain. Through the newly established Malaysia Aerospace Centre of Excellence (MyAERO Centre), NAICO further supports the development of local SMEs with global potential, while reinforcing the nation’s position in the international aerospace supply chain.[8]

There is also industry support in the form of Malaysia Aerospace Industry Association (MAIA), which was established in 2016. MAIA comprises of top management of member companies who are entrusted to draw the guidelines for the group, and with an emphasis on capacity development and international market penetration. Companies can leverage MAIA for assistance for growth and access into new markets, networking within industry and championing the industry’s interest on public policy development.

Besides these, MITI’s agencies, MATRADE and MIDA, also lends support for the export and investment goals of the sector by facilitating export and investment promotion. The former promotes Malaysia’s industry players through dedicated road shows, business networking events, and establishing Malaysian pavilions in foreign airshows. Investment promotion is aided by investment incentives such as income tax exemption for pioneer status, reinvestment allowance, and import duty exemptions.[9] There are conditions such as qualifying activities, employment of Malaysians, investment level and qualifying expenditures as well as a managerial, technical and supervisory staff index of above 25 percent.[10] There is also a biannual Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition held in Langkawi to showcase aerospace firms in Malaysia.

STRUCTURE AND PERFORMANCE

There are over 240 key players involved in Malaysia’s aerospace industry. Of these, 54.0 per cent participate in MRO activities; and 20.0 per cent engage in aerospace manufacturing and engineering, and design services (based on survey data).[11] The latest census of the manufacturing sector in Malaysia shows that there are 51 establishments in this sector, providing 0.31%, and 0.32% of total manufacturing valued added and employment in 2022.

The presence of firms is highest for aerospace manufacturing, MRO, education, and training, and weakest at the design and development stage of the value chain (Chart 1). Tier 1 firms in aerospace manufacturing include foreign companies such as Spirit Aerosystems,[12] Honeywell Aerospace, Safran and UMW, a government-linked company that manufactures Rolls-Royce fan cases.[13] For Tier 2 companies, there are Composites Technology Research Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. which belongs to DRB-Hicom, and SAM Malaysia, which is a subsidiary of Singapore Aerospace Manufacturing (SAM) Pte Ltd. Foreign MRO companies include Airbus SE, GKN Aerospace, and Leonardo Helicopters, while local companies include Airod Sdn. Bhd., and Sapura Tehcnics. There are also a large number of higher education training institutions providing training at the university and TVET level for workers along the value chain.

Chart 1. Firms’ Presence along the Value Chain of Aerospace Industry, 2023

The manufacturing segment is export-oriented as Malaysia is part of the global supply chain for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), due in part to the offset programmes. Companies that are able to meet the global standards set by global OEMs become certified suppliers and contract manufacturers. Thus, manufactured exports grew steadily from 2011 to 2020 due to increasing demand for air travel with the rapid expansion of low-cost carriers, especially Air Asia in Malaysia (Chart 2). However, the emergence of the Covid-pandemic in 2020 reduced air travel significantly, leading to a sharp fall in exports.

Although travel has since recovered, and with it, exports of aerospace products, it has not reached the pre-pandemic level of 2019. Part of this is attributed to the slow recovery in airfare trends. Chart 3 shows a sharp fall in air passengers from 2019 to 2021, before recovering in 2022-2024. Nevertheless, it is still lower than the pre-pandemic 2019 data. Domestic fares have recovered but for international economy class flights, the average airfares for these countries have increased drastically and have remained above 2019 levels.[14] Thus the recovery in international travel is slower than for domestic travel.

It should also be noted that exports are facilitated greatly by imports, with the sector registering a deficit before and after the pandemic. It is this deficit that is driving the policy to increase local content in aero manufacturing.

In 2024, Malaysia exported RM5.74 billion worth of aircraft and spacecraft, ranking as its 25th largest export out of 97 products.[15] Key export destinations were China (RM1.21 billion), the United States (RM1.15 billion), Indonesia (RM684 million), Singapore (RM525 million), and India (RM277 million). The fastest-growing markets from 2023 to 2024 were China, Singapore, and France.

On the import side, Malaysia purchased RM14.9 billion of aircraft and spacecraft in 2024, making these the country’s 17th largest import. Major sources included the United States (RM7.94 billion), France (RM1.57 billion), China (RM1.21 billion), Germany (RM803 million), and Singapore (RM561 million). The fastest-growing import origins between 2023 and 2024 were Germany, Indonesia, and Singapore.

In terms of investments, the sector is dominated by domestic investments throughout the IMP3 period. However, after IMP3 ended in 2025, foreign investments exceeded domestic investments from 2021 to 2024, except for 2022 (Table 2). There were nine projects approved, of which seven were new while two were expansion/diversification/extensions from existing projects.[16]

Table 2. Approved Investments for Aerospace sector, RM million

Notes: IMP3 (Third Industrial Master Plan)

MAIB 2030 identified Malaysia to be number two in Southeast Asia for MRO and Aero manufacturing, behind Singapore but ahead of Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines in 2014.[18] Since then, there are no published metrics on the achievements for the targets in Table 1. In 2024, it was announced that the aerospace sector generated RM25.1 billion in revenue and supported 30,000 skilled workers,[19] which is less than that targeted for 2030, but there is still five more years to go to meet the targets.

More importantly, the sector has changed since MAIB was formulated in 2015, with increased concerns over carbon emissions and higher demand for green manufacturing practices. Likewise, changes in technology have exacerbated the talent shortage, while the Trump 2.0 tariffs have created uncertainties for global value chains, including in aerospace.

OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES

Adopting Green Manufacturing Practices

Aerospace manufacturing is energy-intensive, making carbon compliance a key challenge. This affects Malaysia’s ability to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), as investors increasingly demand adherence to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. With stricter ESG enforcement ahead, contract manufacturers must also ensure that their suppliers also comply. While developed-country suppliers are well-placed to meet these requirements, domestic SMEs may struggle.

To stay competitive, the industry must accelerate ESG adoption, supported by green infrastructure. In this regard, Malaysia can leverage its feedstock resources to expand green electricity and bio-gas infrastructure, and promote Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF, produced from renewable or waste-derived sources, reduces life-cycle emissions by up to 80 percent and is fully compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure. Feedstocks include non-edible crops, agricultural and forestry residues, municipal waste, and industrial off-gassing. Engines currently can operate on a 50:50 SAF–conventional fuel blend, with progress toward 100 percent SAF underway.[20]

As part of the National Energy Transition Roadmap, the government has set a target of achieving a 47 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending mandate by 2050. In line with this goal, Petronas announced in September 2025 the successful delivery of Malaysia’s first locally blended SAF to Malaysia Aviation Group Bhd (MAG), the parent company of Malaysia Airlines.[21] The SAF, processed and blended at Petronas facilities, was supplied to Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) for deployment on Malaysia Airlines’ daily flights to London. Therefore, expanding into the production of SAF, the availability of feedstock can help to offset carbon emissions in the aviation sector.

Technology and Talent Development

MAIB2030 emphasised increasing Malaysia’s capacity for R&D, and fostering collaboration between industry players, research institutions, and academia. For this purpose, Malaysia has established the Aerospace Malaysia Innovation Centre (AMIC). This is an industry-led body focusing on collaborative research in sustainable aviation and the factory of the future; it is located at Universiti Malaya and the Mechanical and Aerospace Technology Division within the Science & Technology Research Institute for Defence for defence-related aerospace research.

Yet Chart 1 shows that the presence of design and development is low in the aerospace ecosystem. This indicates that Malaysia finds it difficult to attract domestic and foreign investment for this segment.

Talent shortages continue to hinder the development of research capabilities. The Critical Occupations List (MYCOL) 2022/2023 identifies a shortage of engineers nationwide. In the aerospace sector (p.45), industry stakeholders report that many fresh graduates lack the technical skills required, due partly to outdated curricula at local universities and training institutions. Graduates also often lack practical, hands-on experience when entering the workforce. Employers further note weak collaboration between universities and industry in designing internship and apprenticeship programmes, leaving many of these initiatives ineffective. Malaysia’s brain drain, especially in skilled labour has compounded the talent shortage.[22] Developing and retaining talent, especially for R&D, therefore remains an outstanding challenge.

Uncertainty over Trump’s Tariff’s

The US is an important export destination, as well as import source. To date, Trump’s reciprocal tariffs stand at 19 percent for Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand, while Singapore scores the lowest at 10 percent. Vietnam’s tariffs are slightly higher, at 20 percent. Brunei, Laos and Myanmar suffer higher tariffs, but they are not competitors in developing aerospace hubs in Southeast Asia. Singapore thus has a tariff advantage over the rest of Southeast Asia, and will continue to maintain its ranking among the top ten globally, for aerospace manufacturing attractiveness, in the comparison conducted by PwC.[23]

The tariffs will however increase the costs of production for aerospace manufacturing for the US, including the tariffs for steel and aluminium. This will lead to higher costs for travel. Global trade and FDI climate in 2025 and 2026 are dampened, with a sharp slowdown in trade growth, and a significant decline in global foreign direct investment (FDI) flows (especially for large-scale projects).[24] This will affect travel and the demand for aircraft, thereby increasing the external headwinds for the continued development of this sector. Moreover, it is unclear whether the reciprocal tariffs will change in the future.

CONCLUSION

Malaysia’s aerospace industry has grown steadily through strong policy support, including financial, institutional backing, infrastructure support, and integration into global value chains, particularly in manufacturing and MRO. However, to move up the value chain and remain competitive, the sector must address structural weaknesses in design and development, close talent gaps, and adapt rapidly to ESG standards, especially for the SMEs in the supply chain. Leveraging the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from available feedstocks presents an opportunity for Malaysia to strengthen its position as a regional aerospace hub while meeting future sustainability demands.

At the heart of this revival is the OEM’s flagship aircraft, the D328eco. Anchored in German engineering and sustainability, the 40-seat turboprop builds on the DNA of the Dornier 328, modernising it with more efficient engines and avionics.

“The D328eco will be capable of flying faster than any other turboprop in production,” according to Deutsche Aircraft. “Its ability to operate on shorter runways enables access to remote communities, fostering economic growth and boosting tourism in underserved areas,” added the OEM.

Key features of the D328eco:

Maximum range of 655nm at full capacity and maximum cruising speed of 324kts

Short take-off and landing (STOL) capabilities

Optimised fuel consumption

High-altitude and hot-weather performance

100% Power to Liquid – sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) compatibility

Quiet, ergonomic cabin

Deutsche Aircraft’s year of milestones

This year (2025) has been a landmark year for Deutsche Aircraft with a steady stream of announcements. On 30 April, two years after construction began, Deutsche Aircraft laid the cornerstone for its Final Assembly Line at Leipzig/ Halle Airport. The CO2-neutral manufacturing facility, scheduled for completion by the end of 2025, will feature a commissioning hangar, logistics centre and administrative building.

“We are making a clear statement: We are bringing the development of a regional aircraft, based on the DNA of Dornier, entirely back to Germany, ” said Nico Neumann, Co-CEO of Deutsche Aircraft, during the ceremony in April.

Just a month later, Deutsche Aircraft unveiled its first D328eco test aircraft at its Airtech Campus headquarters in Oberpfaffenhofen. The unveiling marked a shift from design to practical flight-test preparation, which in turn triggered a further wave of announcements in the months that followed.

During this year’s Paris Airshow in June, Deutsche Aircraft revealed a series of developments, including the integration of a new Garmin G5000 PRIME flight deck into the turboprop.

Speaking to Aerospace Global News during the airshow, Neumann described the partnership with Garmin as a “crucial next step” in making the D328eco “more flexible and intuitive for pilots and crew.”

“It’s like using an iPhone,” he added. “The weather awareness and system integration are incredible. Pilots love the simplicity and situational clarity it brings.”

Additional highlights from Paris Airshow include:

A leadership transition with Nico Neumann appointed as CEO of Deutsche Aircraft and Dave Jackson assuming the role of CEO of Deutsche Aircraft Group.

A Memorandum of Understanding with Aerodata to develop a German-made D328eco Special Mission Aircraft, designed to improve Europe’s intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.

A strengthened partnership with Pratt & Whitney Canada to integrate the PW127XT-S engine, enabling cleaner and more efficient regional air travel.

The appointment of Aernnova as the empennage supplier, completing the primary structure lineup.

Momentum has continued to gather pace beyond Paris

Since the Paris Airshow, Deutsche Aircraft has shown no signs of slowing:

In July, the OEM signed an agreement with TEST-FUCHS to begin testing the aircraft’s advanced fuel system, including trials with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Rasakti was selected to supply precision tooling and ground support equipment for the D328eco and its Pratt & Whitney PW127XT-S engine.

At the end of September, Akkodis agreed to become a first-tier supplier, overseeing system integration, ground and flight testing and final certification.

In the first half of October, two more strategic partnerships were signed. Expleo agreed an engineering services deal, while Jungheinrich was appointed to automate Deutsche Aircraft’s logistics centre at Leipzig/ Halle Airport.

Why India is the next frontier for Deutsche Aircraft

Looking east, Deutsche Aircraft is eyeing rapid growth in India’s aviation market. The OEM will host its ‘Wings of Opportunity’ event in New Delhi in November. The event will be held in collaboration with key Indian organisations, including Aerospace India Association, Cyient (developer of the D328eco’s cabin management system), Dynamatic Technologies (the turboprop’s rear fuselage manufacturer in Bangalore) and SASMOS HET.

Recognising India as the third-largest domestic aviation market with over 220 million passengers in 2024 an annual growth rate of 6.2%, Deutsche Aircraft sees vast potential for the D328eco in the region. The aircraft is well-suited to leverage the Indian government’s UDAN regional connectivity scheme, which aims to link Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, via regional airports (of which there are currently 157), many of which have short runways. Plans are afoot for 50 more airports.

According to Deutsche Aircraft, the D328eco is purpose-built to support India’s regional aviation goals, combining performance, sustainability and efficiency.

Challenges ahead for Deutsche Aircraft

Despite strong progress, several hurdles remain. Certification and first delivery are still pending milestones. Meanwhile, the global supply chain continues to pose challenges around timely supply and the ability to manage cost pressures.

In addition, Deutsche Aircraft continues to face competition from other regional aircraft manufacturers as new turboprops, regional jets and emerging hybrid technologies continue to vie for market share.

However, if Deutsche Aircraft successfully delivers its D328eco programme on time and progresses with its anticipated entry into service in the final quarter of 2027, it could re-establish Germany as a leader in regional aircraft manufacturing.

From infrastructure developments and partnerships to design and rollout, Deutsche Aircraft continues to build momentum. And, while the path from prototype to passenger service remains the critical next phase, the company’s current trajectory points to a comeback for German regional aircraft manufacturing.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Deutsche-Aircraft-D328eco-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 12:01:39.914895

El reglamento ReFuelEU Aviation busca fomentar un transporte aéreo más sostenible a través de la adopción de combustibles de aviación sostenibles en todos los Estados miembros. Con este objetivo, la iniciativa determina que los suministradores de combustible incluyan un mínimo del 2% en los aeropuertos de la Unión Europea en 2025.

Se trata de un componente especialmente relevante, ya que, en sectores como la aviación, la electrificación del transporte no es una alternativa viable. Así, según los cálculos de la UE, los combustibles de aviación sostenibles pueden reducir sus emisiones de CO2, durante todo su ciclo de vida, entre un 65% y un 100%. En este marco se engloban los conocidos como Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), la alternativa más generalizada entre los diversos agentes del sector, ya que puede utilizarse sin modificar los motores de los aviones ni las infraestructuras de los aeropuertos.

El potencial sostenible de los SAF es evidente. Según los cálculos de IATA, este tipo de combustibles pueden reducir hasta en un 80% sus emisiones de CO2. Además, en su ciclo de vida completo, representa una contribución cercana al 65% dentro de todas las herramientas con las que cuenta el sector para cumplir con la estrategia Net Zero Carbon en 2050.

Grandes empresas por una aviación sostenible

En este contexto de lograr un transporte aéreo más sostenible, Iberia ha lanzado Círculo SAF, un programa corporativo con el objetivo de unir a grandes empresas para impulsar el uso de estos combustibles SAF. Como miembros fundadores, cuenta con Amadeus, BBVA, Repsol y Telefónica.

Círculo SAF permite a los clientes de la compañía aérea contribuir a la reducción de parte de las emisiones de alcance 3 generadas en viajes corporativos y transporte de carga, fomentando el uso y desarrollo del combustible sostenible de aviación. Para ello, dichos clientes compran una cantidad equivalente a un determinado porcentaje de la huella de carbono de este tipo de trayectos y transportes.

La reducción de emisiones estimada por el programa es de entre un 10% y un 30%. Actualmente, Iberia está en proceso de recopilación de otras grandes compañías que se unan al Círculo SAF, impulsando, de este modo, la utilización de combustible sostenible de aviación para mitigar el impacto medioambiental de su actividad.","https://images.ecestaticos.com/W8J6E8ENRBzIJZR7ihJlpMjxlKw=/0x0:1200x900/600x315/filters:fill(white):format(jpg):quality(99):watermark(f.elconfidencial.com/file/bae/eea/fde/baeeeafde1b3229287b0c008f7602058.png,0,275,1)/f.elconfidencial.com/original/4b7/6ec/899/4b76ec8990b5f211cc4ddabeb20523f8.jpg",N,,2025-10-25 12:01:44.617716

European Union airports’ use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) in 2024 avoided roughly 714,000 tonnes of CO₂ – the equivalent of about 10,000 return flights between Madrid and Paris – according to a new report from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

The first ReFuelEU Aviation Annual Technical Report, published on 22 October, provides an initial snapshot of SAF production, supply, and uptake across EU airports.

SAF accounts for 0.6% of aviation fuel at EU airports

The headline figure: in 2024, just 0.6% of all aviation fuel supplied at EU airports came from sustainable sources.

That’s a modest start compared with the 2% SAF blending mandate coming into force this year.

EASA data shows that 0.6% of all aviation fuel supplied in 2024 – around 193 kilotonnes – was SAF, mostly biofuel derived from used cooking oil (81%) and waste animal fats (17%).

Synthetic SAF was absent from the mix, underscoring the nascent state of advanced fuels in the EU, EASA said.

The report also highlights market concentration: five member states – France, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Germany – accounted for 99% of supply, while 69% of feedstock came from outside the EU, predominantly China (38%) and Malaysia (12%), with Finland as the largest European contributor (10%).

‘Important first steps’

“The first Annual Technical Report marks an important milestone and makes clear that the EU has taken important first steps,” said Maria Rueda, EASA’s Safety Management, Strategy and Global Outreach Director.

“A functioning reporting system is now in place, initial reporting compliance levels are solid, and SAF delivery is happening across multiple member states.”

While 2024 established a baseline, the report notes the road ahead remains long.

ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation mandates a 2% SAF share in 2025 for around 150 EU airports, rising to a 6% overall blending target by 2030.

Airlines play their part

On the operator side, 74% of airlines subject to ReFuelEU submitted reports, covering 38.8 million tonnes of fuel uplifted at EU airports.

Some 357,000 tonnes of SAF were purchased, slightly more than suppliers reported delivering, suggesting confusion over whether global or EU-only purchases should be declared.

Most of that fuel was claimed under emissions-trading schemes such as the EU ETS (39%) and UK ETS (42%), though none was reported under CORSIA, the UN’s global carbon-offset system.

At an airport level, the pattern of fuel uplift varied widely.

Only 61% of EU airports met the rule requiring operators to refuel at least 90% of the fuel needed for flights, a safeguard against “tankering” cheaper fuel from outside the EU.

Smaller and non-EU operators were the most likely to miss reporting deadlines.

Production expands, but slowly

EASA found 17 EU member states now host SAF production or announced projects, up from 12 in 2023 – clear evidence that investment momentum is building. Yet synthetic aviation fuels, seen as the long-term replacement for fossil kerosene, remain well behind schedule.

Not a single e-fuel project in the EU has yet reached a final investment decision, raising doubts over the bloc’s ability to meet the 2030 sub-target for synthetic fuels unless several projects break ground by 2026.

Depending on the scenario, EASA projects 1.4 to 5.2 million tonnes of SAF production capacity (plus 0.7 Mt of synthetic fuels) could be available by 2030 – potentially enough to meet near-term quotas but not the 20% SAF target for 2035.

What are the barriers to SAF use?

According to the EASA report, SAF costs remain elevated, averaging €2,085 per tonne compared with €734 for conventional jet fuel, which, combined with limited feedstock and production bottlenecks, continues to challenge widespread uptake.

Despite these hurdles, EASA concludes that the EU is on track to scale SAF gradually, with reporting compliance and delivery systems improving – setting the stage for a more sustainable aviation sector over the coming decade.

What is the situation in the UK?

In the UK, the demands placed on airlines and airports to use SAF are even more rigorous.

The SAF Mandate starts in 2025 at 2% of total UK jet fuel demand, increasing linearly to 10% in 2030 and then to 22% in 2040.

From 2040, the obligation will remain at 22% of total UK jet fuel demand until there is greater certainty regarding SAF supply.

The UK’s SAF Mandate could deliver up to 6.3 megatonnes of carbon savings per year by 2040.

The music streaming industry’s revenue sits at a whopping $17.5 billion, with over 600 million people subscribed to a music streaming service. And with Taylor Swift’s latest album playing in the grocery store, Doechii dropping stunning verses during her tiny desk concert, and sound bites from a wide array of underground artists capturing millions on platforms like TikTok, it’s no wonder people can’t get enough of their favorite musicians and groups.

The highlight of a listener’s music experience is often seeing their favorite artist in concert. Music festivals draw millions of fun-loving fans and artists every year, bursting with a wide array of colorful cultural experiences, exclusive merchandise, and head banging music.

How do Music Festivals Impact the Environment?

With so many music-lovers and fans crowding in to catch a glimpse of their idols, festivals have their work cut out for them balancing the energy consumption and waste production they incur. From single-wear, themed concert outfits to leftover plastic tents and tossed out merchandise, concerts and festivals generate solid and chemical waste in excess.

For one, all that lovely glitter adorning festival-goer faces and outfits often ends up washing out into bodies of water like rivers and lakes. As a kind of microplastic, glitter does not break down and winds up polluting our natural water ways and being consumed by fish, birds and other animals.

Flimsy plastic festival tents are another issue. They are often made with polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a toxic chemical pollutant resistant to breakdown. In 2022 in the UK, on average nearly 80% of festival goers left tents behind, and these tents are almost impossible to recycle.

Emissions from transportation add to these issues. Besides the hoards of fans driving or flying out to concerts, private aviation and long-haul trucking rack up CO2 emissions in the blink of an eye. A Greener Festival report notes that transportation emissions account for between 35% and 94% of festival goers’ total carbon emissions.

To tackle these problems, many festivals and artists around the world are fighting for change, collaborating with waste management companies, updating stadium policies, and promoting educational outreach to inform attendees of their environmental impacts and recommended best practices. Let’s take a moment to shout-out some of these festivals striving towards change.

Calling all Shambhalans

The Canadian EDM festival Shambhala advocates for a “leave no trace” approach. Weaving their various stages into the landscape, Shambhala fuses nature with music, aiming to capture audiences not only with their impressive artist line-ups but also with the stunning wilderness vistas. They hope to follow in the footsteps of the Sylix, Sinixt, and Ktunaxa nations, honoring the land and water and protecting it for years to come.

In 2024, Shambhala raised £147,758 for community and environmental initiatives. With their eco-travel plan, they helped over a third of attendees arrive on low-impact transportation including coach and rail. In terms of food, the festival composted 10 tonnes of waste, pioneered crew food with 47% organic produce — the majority of which was sourced within 200 miles of the venue, and offered meals with an average of 0.45 kg CO2 per plate. For reference, the average carbon emissions of a concert meal in the UK is 2 kg CO2 per plate.

Lightning in a Bottle

The U.S.-based Lightning in a Bottle festival takes “leave no trace” a step further. Adopting the slogan “leave a positive trace,” they encourage attendees to take care of their own waste, respect the land, and avoid littering. They opt for sustainable energy, including LED and solar lights for stage lighting. They avoid single-use plastic water bottles by providing free water. Attendees are asked to avoid trampling plants off the beaten path and not to disturb wildlife as a part of their push to honor the land.

DGTL Festival

The Netherlands boast one of the most sustainable music festivals in the world: DGTL Festival. Since 2022, DGTL has managed to be 100% fossil fuel free, committed to retackling the energy problem each year and avoiding harmful emissions. They explored solar, hydro, hydrogen, and even sound waves as potential sources of renewable energy.

In addition to energy, DGTL offers no-waste, safe water, and entirely plant-based food. Artists flying in have their planes’ fuel replaced with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a kind of biofuel made up of plant and animal materials. Machinery used on-site is all low emission or zero emission. Hard cups have been introduced to replace single-use and one-time-physical-tokens have been swapped for cashless card payments.

Fans for Change

There are plenty of things fans can do to mitigate environmental impacts. If possible, consider taking public transportation, carpooling, riding a bike, or walking to your festival or concert venue. Explore your local thrift store for your next niche concert outfit rather than buying from fast-fashion brands. Consider using biodegradable glitter or bringing a reusable water bottle to avoid microplastic pollution. We all have a responsibility to our planet and some of the smallest steps, if done collectively, can have a positive impact.

So, the next time you’re reloading Ticket Master eight times in a minute for that golden ticket to your favorite artist, remember to tread lightly on the land and respect the water. Rocking out on Earth means dancing in tune with our planet’s rhythms too.

Still, carriers around the globe, including Qantas Airways, are investing heavily in hopes of accelerating the production of SAF, according to the report.","The Ethiopian Mineral Corporation and Sunbird Bioenergy Africa signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) this week that would see vast tracts of farmland dedicated to growing sugarcane and cassava to be used as inputs for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), clean household cooking fuel, and transport ethanol blends.

The agreement, signed by Corporation CEO Tewodros Getachew and Sunbird chief executive Richard Bennett, outlines plans to develop a 20,000 hectare biorefinery where locally produced feedstocks such as sugarcane and cassava will be processed into renewable fuel.

Sunbird will be in charge of production, slated to begin in 2030, while the Corporation will provide industrial expertise and infrastructural support, according to the MoU.

Corporation executives and government officials say the move is part of Ethiopia’s wider transition towards green energy, which has thus far seen a series of measures designed to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles.

While the project envisions the production of clean household cooking fuel to replace charcoal and kerosene, its primary objective is sustainable aviation fuel, which the Corporation plans to sell to the Ethiopian Airlines Group.

Temesgen Getaye, Group treasurer, hailed the MoU as a historic milestone.

“As we grow our network, modernize our fleet, open new routes, and reach more customers than ever, we simultaneously face urgent environmental and climate challenges,” he said, highlighting SAF as a potential avenue towards reducing Ethiopian Airlines’ environmental impact.

As a member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Ethiopian has committed to the ambitious target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

However, SAF remains largely untested.

A World Economic Forum report from 2023 indicated that SAF accounted for less than 0.1 percent of global consumption. The report also highlighted issues such as SAF’s high price point (four times more expensive than jet fuel) and relatively low energy density.

“Planes would therefore need to carry high volumes of SAF to make long-haul flights—such high volumes that it could become impractical,” it reads.

Still, carriers around the globe, including Qantas Airways, are investing heavily in hopes of accelerating the production of SAF, according to the report.

The MoU also raises questions about the efficacy and commitment of Sunbird, whose website claims it has successfully implemented similar projects in Sierra Leone and Zambia.

However, a 2024 report by a Zambian news outlet indicated that large tracts of farmland dedicated to growing cassava for a strategic biofuel project under Sunbird had never been harvested, more than six years after local farmers agreed to grow the cash crop.",https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MINERAL-CORP-SUNBIRD-BIOENERGY-PARTNER.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 12:02:02.289882

Yet after each wave of excitement, enthusiasm faded as commercialization hurdles proved tougher than many anticipated.

In my 17 years covering this industry, I’ve done much reporting on the topic. For example, more than a decade ago, the 550-MW Boardman Coal Plant in Boardman, Oregon, sought to repower with torrefied biomass. The utility performed a series of test trials and the effort lasted several years beginning in 2013, but it was ultimately deemed unfeasible due to technical challenges with the torrefaction process and difficulties in securing a reliable, sustainable biomass fuel supply, among other reasons. The plant permanently closed several years ago and was demolished, despite having many years of potential life left.

Today, however, the tide appears to be turning. New projects, improved technologies and fresh investment are bringing the concept back into focus—and this time, progress feels more tangible than ever. The market for torrefied and steam-treated pellets may finally be taking shape, as reflected by the increasing coverage in Pellet Mill Magazine, including this issue.

In our page-10 article, “Bringing Black Pellets to Belledune,” contributing writer Keith Loria explores the Belledune Clean Fuel Project in New Brunswick, Canada, which is seeking an alternative fuel source and examining the long-term viability of 100% advanced pellets after completing two test burns. The plan is to be off coal by 2030—still four years away, but that will come quickly.

All of the above said, white pellets aren’t going anywhere. Their global production base, proven reliability and established supply chains continue to anchor the biomass sector—and will for years to come. As black pellet ventures gain traction, it’s not a story of replacement, but one of expansion and diversification within a maturing industry.

New markets for white pellets are also emerging. In our page-16 feature article, “Forest Waste to Flight Fuel,” Associate Editor Katie Schroeder covers a panel at the North American Sustainable Aviation Fuel Conference & Expo, during which industry experts made the case for wood pellets and other wood residuals as potential feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel production. I was shocked to learn that a storm in Bemidji, Minnesota, this summer took down an estimated 9 million trees. Instances like this raise the question: What can be done with this waste—and why not use it for SAF or other bioenergy initiatives, if no other higher-value use?

Of course, project developers can’t rely on storms to provide the consistent feedstock streams they need. In the article, Schroeder reports on the remarks of the U.S. Industrial Pellet Association’s Darrell Smith, who focused on the abundant and increasing forestry resources in the Southeast and why it makes sense for landowners and pellet producers to participate in biofuel and bioenergy markets. While industrial wood pellet producers have historically served overseas markets, he noted, they would like to develop domestic outlets as well. Smith also pointed to the downturn of the pulp and paper industry as a catalyst for finding new uses for wood waste and residuals. “We need to build more pellet mills because we really need more of them—it’s one of the only solutions to this declining paper market,” he said.

Finally, I’d like to mention that the abstract portal for speaking opportunities at the International Biomass Conference & Expo is now open. We have a dedicated track for wood pellets and biocarbon and fully expect all spots to be filled. Join us in Nashville in 2026—apply to speak, register or learn more at biomassconference.com.

Market conditions remained mixed across MTX’s diverse portfolio, with particular weakness in construction-related markets and renewed uncertainty around tariff policies.

""We delivered record third-quarter earnings per share with strong execution amid mixed market conditions,"" said Douglas T. Dietrich, Chairman and CEO, highlighting the company’s performance in the challenging environment.

Quarterly Performance Highlights

Minerals Technologies reported Q3 2025 sales of $532 million, representing a modest 1% increase both sequentially and year-over-year. Operating income was $78 million, down 1% from both the prior quarter and the same period last year. The company maintained earnings per share of $1.55, flat compared to Q2 but up 3% year-over-year.

As shown in the following financial overview:

Operating margin contracted slightly to 14.7%, representing a 20 basis point decline from the previous quarter and a 40 basis point reduction year-over-year. Despite these margin pressures, the company generated strong free cash flow of $44 million in the quarter, a 24% improvement from the same period in 2024.

The company returned $20 million to shareholders during the quarter and announced a 9% increase to its quarterly dividend, demonstrating confidence in its financial position despite the mixed operating environment.

Segment Performance Analysis

Minerals Technologies operates through two main segments: Consumer & Specialties and Engineered Solutions, each showing different performance trajectories during the quarter.

The Consumer & Specialties segment reported sales of $277 million in Q3, relatively flat compared to $278 million in the previous quarter. Operating income for this segment remained stable at $37 million, unchanged from Q2 but down from $42 million in Q3 2024. The company noted that pet litter sales were gaining momentum, while growth continued in natural oil purification and fabric care products.

The segment performance is detailed in the following chart:

The Engineered Solutions segment showed more positive momentum, with sales increasing to $255 million in Q3 from $251 million in Q2. Operating income improved to $45 million from $44 million in the previous quarter. This segment achieved a record operating margin of 17.6%, demonstrating strong execution despite tariff impacts.

As illustrated in the segment breakdown:

""We achieved record operating margin at 17.6% of sales in our Engineered Solutions segment through strong execution while mitigating tariff impacts,"" noted Erik C. Aldag, Senior Vice President, Finance and Treasury and Chief Financial Officer during the presentation.

Strategic Growth Initiatives

Despite near-term market challenges, Minerals Technologies continues to invest in organic growth opportunities across its business segments. The company highlighted several key investment areas aligned with high-growth markets, including cat litter, global bleaching earth, and paper and packaging in Asia.

The following chart details the company’s recent organic growth investments:

Notable initiatives include upgrading cat litter production facilities in the US and Canada while expanding capacity in rapidly growing Asian markets.

This technology provides significant value to customers while creating a recurring revenue stream for the company.

Balance Sheet and Capital Allocation

Minerals Technologies maintained a strong financial position, with total liquidity of $706 million as of Q3 2025, a significant improvement from $556 million in the same period last year. The company reduced its net debt slightly to $649 million from $658 million in Q3 2024, resulting in a net leverage ratio of 1.7x EBITDA.

The following chart illustrates the company’s balance sheet strength and capital deployment:

Free cash flow generation was particularly strong at $44 million for the quarter, representing a 24% increase from $35 million in Q3 2024. This improvement came despite slightly higher capital expenditures of $27 million compared to $25 million in the prior year period.

The company’s balanced approach to capital allocation was evident in its decision to return $20 million to shareholders during the quarter while continuing to invest in growth initiatives and maintaining financial flexibility.

Forward Outlook and Guidance

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Minerals Technologies provided a more cautious outlook, projecting sales between $510 million and $525 million and operating income between $65 million and $70 million. This guidance implies a sequential decline from Q3 results, with earnings per share expected to range from $1.20 to $1.30.

The company’s Q4 outlook is summarized in the following projection:

Several factors are driving this more conservative outlook, including seasonally slower construction activity, softer residential construction markets, and foundry customers signaling longer downtime at year-end. The company also cited renewed uncertainty around tariff policies as a potential headwind.

For the Consumer & Specialties segment, management expects similar performance in Household & Personal Care products but anticipates soft market conditions and a seasonally slow period in residential construction. The Engineered Solutions segment is projected to see modestly lower sales in High-Temperature Technologies due to foundry outages and a typical seasonal reduction in Environmental & Infrastructure activities.

Despite these near-term challenges, the company remains focused on its long-term growth initiatives, particularly in high-growth markets such as sustainable aviation fuel, pet care products, and specialized technology solutions.

“Introducing SAF for the first time at our hubs in Houston, Newark, and Dulles is another significant milestone in United’s sustainability journey,” said United Chief Sustainability Officer Lauren Riley. “While United remains one of the leading SAF users in the U.S., using over 4,300 tons last year, we recognize that the growth of the SAF market requires support from both state and federal governments. We will continue collaborating with stakeholders, like Neste, across the aviation value chain to encourage policymakers to implement sensible market incentives that promote lower-carbon energy.”

The partnership supports the aviation industry’s goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Neste’s commitment to scaling SAF production is emphasized by Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste, who stated: “We are thrilled to enable United Airlines to expand SAF use to new markets in the U.S. It is crucial that more states enact proven incentive policy frameworks to accelerate the production of SAF and support the aviation industry towards its bold net-zero carbon emission goal by 2050. We remain fully committed to supporting our customers in reducing emissions by scaling our SAF production and supply capabilities.”

This initiative builds on United’s leadership in SAF adoption, having utilized significant volumes in prior years. The expansion to these airports enhances access to lower-carbon fuel, reducing the environmental impact of flights. By leveraging existing infrastructure, the partnership ensures seamless integration of SAF into operations, supporting both economic and environmental objectives.

The collaboration highlights the importance of industry partnerships in advancing sustainable aviation. As demand for SAF grows, Neste and United are working to encourage supportive policies that foster production and adoption. This effort positions the U.S. aviation sector as a leader in sustainable fuel use, contributing to global efforts to reduce carbon emissions while maintaining operational efficiency.",,N,,2025-10-25 06:56:15.009117

Fuel Efficiency And Environmental Goals Fuel efficiency has become the defining metric of modern engine success, and both manufacturers tout impressive numbers.","In the world of modern aviation, two names dominate the skies when it comes to large turbofan engines: General Electric (GE) and Rolls-Royce. Each represents a distinct philosophy in engineering and design. GE’s GE9X, developed exclusively for Boeing’s upcoming 777X, is a testament to size and raw power, the largest jet engine ever built. Rolls-Royce’s Trent XWB, meanwhile, powers Airbus’ A350 and has earned a reputation as one of the most efficient and reliable engines in commercial service. Both engines showcase the pinnacle of aerospace innovation, yet they embody very different approaches to achieving performance, efficiency, and sustainability.

As the global aviation industry faces growing pressure to cut emissions and operating costs, the rivalry between these two engine makers has never been more relevant. Airlines now scrutinize every kilogram of thrust and every fraction of fuel burn in pursuit of lower carbon footprints and higher profitability. In comparing the GE9X and Trent XWB, it becomes clear that while both engines share common goals of efficiency, reliability, and sustainability, the paths they take to achieve them couldn’t be more different.

Engineering Philosophy: Two Paths To Power

At the heart of the GE9X is a philosophy of power through simplicity. GE has long favored the twin-spool engine configuration, one low-pressure and one high-pressure spool, which reduces complexity, weight, and maintenance demands. In the GE9X, this simplicity is paired with enormous scale. It’s the largest turbofan engine ever produced, with a fan diameter of 134 inches (3.4 meters), allowing vast volumes of air to move through the engine for exceptional efficiency. The result is a design that pushes traditional boundaries without complicating the core mechanics.

Rolls-Royce’s approach with the Trent XWB reflects its faith in the three-shaft configuration that defines the entire Trent family. Instead of two rotating assemblies, it uses three: low, intermediate, and high-pressure systems, each spinning at its optimal speed. This architecture offers improved aerodynamic performance across various flight regimes and more stable operation under varying loads and altitudes. It also gives Rolls-Royce engineers greater flexibility in fine-tuning the engine for specific aircraft variants, such as the Airbus A350-900 and Airbus A350-1000.

Both philosophies have proven effective, yet they embody contrasting traditions. GE’s approach favours manufacturing scalability and fewer moving parts, while Rolls-Royce prioritizes refined mechanical harmony and in-flight adaptability. These differences shape everything from maintenance intervals to fuel consumption curves, making the GE9X and Trent XWB as much a reflection of their companies’ cultures as their engineering choices.

Size And Performance: The Numbers That Matter

The GE9X’s sheer dimensions are staggering. Its 134 inch (3.4 meter) fan, roughly the width of a Boeing 737 fuselage, makes it the largest jet engine ever certified for commercial use. Capable of producing up to 105,000 pounds of thrust, it is designed to meet the demands of the 777X, set to be the world's largest twin jet. The engine’s bypass ratio of around 10:1 ensures that most of the air it moves bypasses the core, resulting in both quieter operation and improved fuel efficiency compared to its predecessor, the GE90.

By contrast, the Trent XWB’s fan measures a smaller but still impressive 118 inches (3 meters) and delivers thrust levels ranging from 84,000 to 97,000 pounds, depending on the model. Its bypass ratio sits just below GE’s at roughly 9.6:1, optimized for the Airbus A350’s aerodynamic profile. While not the most powerful engine in raw terms, it offers a balance of thrust and efficiency that perfectly suits the A350’s long-haul and ultra-long-haul mission profile, enabling flights of up to 9,700 nautical miles ( Airbus A350-900ULR).

The difference in thrust reflects the distinct aircraft they power. The Boeing 777X requires higher thrust to accommodate its greater takeoff weight and payload capacity, while the A350 prioritizes range and fuel economy. In practice, both engines deliver near-identical gains in specific fuel consumption compared to previous generations, a testament to how far propulsion technology has advanced, even as design philosophies diverge.

Materials And Innovation: Composites Vs Traditional

GE’s GE9X marks a breakthrough in materials engineering. It features carbon-fibre composite fan blades and cases, reducing overall engine weight by hundreds of kilograms. More critically, it incorporates ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) in high-temperature turbine components. These advanced ceramics can withstand temperatures hundreds of degrees hotter than metal alloys while remaining lighter and more durable, contributing directly to higher efficiency and longer component life.

Rolls-Royce takes a different approach, emphasizing incremental improvement over radical change. The Trent XWB uses single-crystal turbine blades, advanced nickel alloys, and sophisticated cooling technologies to manage extreme heat within its high-pressure core. The manufacturer's expertise in thermal control allows the engine to maintain optimal performance over long service intervals, reducing wear and extending the time between overhauls. This design philosophy has given the Trent XWB one of the highest dispatch reliability rates in the industry.

Both engines also reflect sustainability-focused innovation. Their advanced materials allow for higher combustion efficiency and lower emissions, and both are certified to operate on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). While GE has made headlines for its aggressive use of composites, Rolls-Royce’s steady evolution underscores that innovation can come as much from refinement as reinvention.

Fuel Efficiency And Environmental Goals

Fuel efficiency has become the defining metric of modern engine success, and both manufacturers tout impressive numbers. GE claims the GE9X offers a 10% improvement in specific fuel consumption over the GE90, achieved through its larger fan, lean-burn combustor, and advanced turbine materials. This translates into significant fuel savings for airlines, a crucial advantage as fuel costs remain the single largest operating expense for most carriers.

The Trent XWB, meanwhile, has already established itself as a benchmark for efficiency in real-world operations. Since entering service in 2014, it has powered the A350 fleet through millions of flight hours, consistently delivering the lowest fuel burn per seat among widebody aircraft. Rolls-Royce’s continuous software updates and engine health monitoring systems have further optimized performance, ensuring that each engine operates as close as possible to its theoretical efficiency limits throughout its lifespan.

Both companies are deeply invested in sustainability initiatives. The GE9X and Trent XWB are fully compatible with sustainable aviation fuels and form part of broader efforts to reduce lifecycle emissions. As the industry shifts toward net-zero carbon targets by 2050, these engines represent transitional technologies bridging today’s fossil-fuel era with a cleaner future built on hydrogen, hybrid-electric, or next-generation SAF propulsion systems.

Reliability, Maintenance, In-Service Record

Reliability remains a cornerstone of any successful commercial engine program. Here, the Trent XWB enjoys the advantage of time. With more than a decade of service, it boasts dispatch reliability rates exceeding 99.9%, and operators consistently report stable performance across varying climates and cycles. Rolls-Royce’s long experience with the Trent family provides a robust foundation for predictive maintenance and global support infrastructure.

The GE9X, though newer, benefits from the lessons learned across decades of GE engine development. Having completed over 5,000 hours of testing, including extreme temperature, crosswind, and endurance trials, it has proven capable of withstanding punishing conditions. GE’s use of digital twin technology, real-time virtual replicas of each engine in service, promises to revolutionize maintenance scheduling and reduce unscheduled downtime once the 777X enters airline fleets.

That said, reliability is only proven in service, and GE will need to demonstrate consistency across thousands of operational hours before airlines can fully trust its long-term performance. Rolls-Royce’s Trent XWB, while largely trouble-free, has not been without challenges; regulatory inspections in recent years remind the industry that even mature engines can face component fatigue issues. Ultimately, both engines underline that reliability is not just about design; it’s about continuous monitoring, data, and global support.

Market Impact, Future Of Widebody Power

The GE9X and Trent XWB represent more than just engineering triumphs; they embody the strategic alignment of engine manufacturers with aircraft makers. GE’s exclusive partnership with Boeing on the 777X ensures complete integration and optimization, a move that consolidates GE’s dominance in the large twin-engine market. Rolls-Royce, in turn, enjoys exclusivity on the A350, giving it a stable, long-term platform to refine and expand its Trent family.

In market terms, both engines are vital to the recovery and modernization of the long-haul segment. The Trent XWB’s proven efficiency makes it a favorite for airlines rebuilding international routes post-pandemic, while the GE9X’s upcoming entry into service with the 777X will reintroduce new performance benchmarks for payload and range. Each engine anchors its manufacturer’s future competitiveness and signals a long-term bet on sustained demand for large twin jets.

Looking ahead, both companies are investing heavily in next-generation propulsion concepts, from Rolls-Royce’s UltraFan program to GE’s open-fan architecture under the CFM RISE initiative. These efforts will likely redefine what efficiency and sustainability mean in aviation. But for now, the GE9X and Trent XWB remain the crown jewels of widebody propulsion, proof that while the race toward greener skies is far from over, the competition at 40,000 feet has never been more compelling.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rollsroyce.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-24 22:56:11.820010

While committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, the aviation sector argues that policy must reflect current production realities.
“Instead of increasing SAF production as regulators intended, the mandate has caused prices to rise without meeting production targets,” he said.
A report from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) showed SAF accounted for only 0.6% of total aviation fuel at EU airports in 2024.
The mandate requires 2% SAF blending in 2025 and 6% by 2030—levels Walsh said cannot be met under current production.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned that the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate is raising operating costs for airlines without sufficiently increasing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. Speaking at IATA’s World Sustainability Symposium, Director General Willie Walsh called the regulation “not fit for purpose.”

Walsh noted that airlines are absorbing most of the mandate’s cost impact. While committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, the aviation sector argues that policy must reflect current production realities. “Instead of increasing SAF production as regulators intended, the mandate has caused prices to rise without meeting production targets,” he said.

A report from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) showed SAF accounted for only 0.6% of total aviation fuel at EU airports in 2024. The mandate requires 2% SAF blending in 2025 and 6% by 2030—levels Walsh said cannot be met under current production.

IATA estimates the transition to net-zero emissions will cost around US$174 billion per year, or nearly US$35 per passenger annually, far exceeding the current average profit of US$7 per passenger, increasing financial pressure on airlines.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA Chief Economist and SVP of Sustainability, emphasized that decarbonization remains essential but must be backed by policies that expand supply instead of raising costs. Walsh called for a redesign of ReFuelEU, stating: “If levies do not lead to a significant increase in SAF production, they are not meeting their purpose.”

He cited the United States as a model, where incentives have accelerated SAF development. EASA data shows SAF prices averaged US$2,400 per ton in 2024, compared with US$852 per ton for conventional jet fuel. Walsh criticized fuel producers, saying SAF prices “are set far above conventional fuel without justification tied to production capacity.”

Paris, October 24, 2025 – TotalEnergies SE acknowledges the decision of the Paris Judicial Court, which dismissed the majority of the claims brought against it, notably those targeting the Company’s corporate communications. The Court ordered the removal from its French affiliate’s website, aimed at its customers, of three paragraphs concerning the carbon neutrality ambition. Contrary to what certain media reported, the claims relating to the communication campaign associated with its name change in 2021, as well as those targeting its institutional communication on the role of natural gas and biofuels in the energy transition, were all rejected. No “advertising” by TotalEnergies’ affiliates in France was condemned by the Court.

In light of this ruling, which actually pertains to the fact that the scenario on which TotalEnergies’ multi-energy (oil, gas, power) transition strategy is based is not mentioned in these three paragraphs, TotalEnergies SE and its affiliate TotalEnergies Électricité et Gaz France have decided not to appeal the decision. The three paragraphs concerned will be replaced by a factual description of TotalEnergies’ achievements to date in the implementation of its multi-energy strategy, to dispel any doubts among its customers.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as the most practical near-term solution, offering significant emission reductions without requiring major aircraft or infrastructure changes.

Globally, SAF development is gaining momentum, supported by national mandates, corporate commitments, and rapid advancements in renewable energy and conversion technologies.

Demand Growth Insights

Rising SAF demand is projected to reach 500 million tons (Mt) by 2050, aligning with the global Net Zero emission target.

The expansion of SAF production will rely heavily on the availability of biomass feedstock, which is essential for scaling up capacity.

Policy mandates and corporate decarbonization commitments are the main drivers of market adoption, while continuous innovation in conversion efficiency and logistics remains crucial to meet future demand sustainably.

Four Leading SAF Pathways: Process and Key Feedstocks

The development of SAF relies on several certified technological routes. Each pathway uses different types of feedstock and production processes, resulting in unique cost structures and scalability potential.

The HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) pathway remains the most commercially mature. It converts feedstock using hydrogen to remove oxygen and produce hydrocarbon fuel components. Typical feedstocks include vegetable oil, animal fat, and used cooking oil.

The ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet) route transforms lignocellulosic materials, sugar, or starch-based feedstock into alcohols such as ethanol and butanol, which are then further processed into jet-range hydrocarbons.

The BG-FT (Biomass Gasification – Fischer Tropsch) process converts carbon-containing biomass, such as wood residues or agricultural waste, into synthesis gas (syngas) and then into SAF through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.

Lastly, PtL or e-fuels (Power-to-Liquids) use a similar process to FT, but the synthesis gas is generated from green hydrogen and captured CO₂. This method is still in the early stages of commercialization and is highly dependent on renewable electricity costs and availability.

Global Policy and Emission Targets

Under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), several initiatives are driving the sector’s decarbonization journey. The CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) program, implemented from 2021 to 2035, requires airlines to offset any emissions that exceed their 2020 baseline. ICAO has also set the Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, while the Third Conference on Aviation and Alternative Fuels (CAAF/3) focuses on advancing Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF), and other clean aviation energy technologies.

Meanwhile, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) aligns the commercial aviation sector through its Fly Net Zero initiative, a collective commitment among member airlines to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Supporting organizations like ATAG, ACI, and CANSO further contribute by promoting sustainable airport operations, efficient air navigation, and cross-industry collaboration.

Together, these global frameworks represent a unified roadmap that connects regulation, technology, and market action in the aviation industry’s transition toward sustainability.

SAF Production Cost Breakdown by Pathway

SAF production cost generally consists of three major components: Feedstock, Capital and Operational Costs (Capex/Opex), and Energy & Utilities.

HEFA: Dominated by feedstock cost (≈50%), making it sensitive to fluctuations in vegetable oil or fat prices.

AtJ and FT: Have the highest Capex/Opex shares (50% and 55.56%), heavily dependent on scale-up to achieve cost efficiency.

PtL/eSAF: Dominated by Energy & Utilities (57.89%), mainly renewable electricity and hydrogen production.

Each pathway has unique cost drivers: HEFA depends on feedstock prices, PtL on clean energy costs, and AtJ/FT on capital investment and operational scale.

Indonesia’s Position in the Global SAF Market

Indonesia holds a unique position in the global SAF landscape due to its abundant and diverse feedstock resources.

Rice straw, sugarcane, corn, and cassava are widely available across Java and Sumatra; palm residues and wood waste dominate Kalimantan and Papua; while coconut and sugarcane play key roles in Sulawesi and Bali.

Indonesia holds a remarkable position in Southeast Asia’s SAF development, accounting for around 38% of the region’s total feedstock potential. This advantage is supported by ongoing refinery expansion, with facilities in Cilacap (0.42 Mt per year), Plaju (0.93 Mt per year), and Cilegon (0.30 Mt per year). Altogether, these projects bring Indonesia’s planned SAF refining capacity to over 1.6 million tons annually, underscoring the country’s growing readiness to supply sustainable aviation fuel at a regional scale.

In terms of characteristics, SAF is chemically and physically identical to conventional jet fuel, making it fully compatible with the current aviation infrastructure.
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents a vital milestone in the clean-energy transition of the aviation sector.","The world is racing toward the Net Zero Emission 2050 target. Many industries are gradually shifting away from fossil fuels and adopting cleaner energy sources. Aviation, however, remains one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonize because of its reliance on high-energy liquid fuels such as jet fuel. To address this challenge, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as a practical solution that allows aircraft to fly cleaner without changing engines or airport infrastructure.

What Is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable jet fuel made from sustainable resources or waste materials that meet strict sustainability criteria. It’s known as a drop-in fuel, meaning it can be used directly in existing aircraft without any modification to engines or fuel systems.

In terms of characteristics, SAF is chemically and physically identical to conventional jet fuel, making it fully compatible with the current aviation infrastructure. More importantly, using SAF can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80% over its full life cycle — a major step toward decarbonizing global aviation.

Fuel Standards and Quality

Jet fuel used in Indonesia, including SAF, follows the ASTM D1655 international standard and also refers to the Directorate General of Oil and Gas Regulation (No. 32.K/10/DJM/2020) with Jet A-1 as the main type. Conventional jet fuel is a mixture of hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 150–300°C, a minimum flash point of 38°C, and a maximum freezing point of –47°C.

In the international certification system, two key standards are interconnected:

ASTM D7566 – regulates jet fuels containing synthetic blending components.

ASTM D1655 – serves as the final standard for Jet A and Jet A-1 used in commercial operations.

SAF produced under ASTM D7566 can be used widely after blending and meeting the D1655 quality requirements. This dual-standard approach ensures safety, performance, and full compatibility with modern jet engines.

SAF Production Technologies

SAF can be produced through several certified pathways depending on the feedstock and conversion process. The main ASTM-approved pathways include:

HEFA-SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids): made from vegetable oils, animal fats, or used cooking oil. This is the most commercially mature route today.

FT-SPK (Fischer–Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene): produced from biomass converted into syngas and then refined into liquid fuel.

ATJ-SPK (Alcohol-to-Jet): derived from alcohols such as ethanol or butanol converted into paraffinic kerosene.

Other emerging technologies such as SIP, CHJ, and HC-HEFA are still under research and pilot-scale development.

Global Biofuel Trends

As of 2023, bioethanol and biodiesel (FAME) still dominate global renewable fuel production. However, the HVO/HEFA segment is growing rapidly, marking a global shift from conventional biofuels to synthetic hydrocarbon fuels that are more compatible with aviation. This trend strengthens SAF’s role as a key part of the global energy transition in the air transport sector.

SAF Development in Indonesia

Indonesia is among the countries actively developing bio-jet fuel. Pilot projects in Pertamina’s refineries (Dumai and Cilacap) have successfully tested the co-processing of renewable feedstocks with fossil fuels.

The Dumai Refinery produced hydrocarbon biodiesel (Dxx).

The Cilacap Refinery produced J2.4, a blend containing 2.4% bio-jet fuel that has already been tested in commercial flights.

The government targets gradual implementation, starting with 1% SAF in 2027 and increasing to 50% by 2060, with an estimated production capacity of 7.88 million kiloliters per year. The first phase will rely on Green Refinery Cilacap, using used cooking oil (UCO) as the main feedstock.

Global Sustainability and the CORSIA Framework

To ensure that renewable aviation fuels truly deliver environmental and social benefits, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has established strict criteria under the CORSIA program (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation). Only fuels that meet comprehensive sustainability requirements are recognized as CORSIA-eligible.

Key Criteria for CORSIA-Eligible Fuels

Greenhouse Gas Emissions: at least 10% lower than fossil jet fuel based on full Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).

Land Use: must not come from primary forests, peatlands, or high-carbon-stock areas.

Environmental Protection: should preserve water, soil, air quality, biodiversity, and local ecosystems.

Social and Economic Aspects: must respect human rights, land and water access, and contribute to food security and community welfare.

Certification: must be verified by ICAO-approved schemes such as ISCC or RSB.

Commonly Accepted Feedstocks

Wastes and residues: used cooking oil (UCO), animal fat, agricultural and forestry residues, municipal solid waste (MSW).

Non-food crops: camelina, jatropha, pongamia, algae oil.

Certain food crops: sugarcane, corn, wheat — only if verified as non-disruptive to food supply.

Gaseous and e-fuels: industrial gases and combinations of CO₂ and hydrogen (power-to-liquid).

These criteria ensure SAF is not just “green on paper” but genuinely contributes to reducing global emissions while promoting social equity and environmental sustainability.

Economic Challenges and Market Outlook

Production cost remains a major barrier. Today, SAF costs 2-4 times higher than conventional Jet A-1, around US $1,200–2,000 per ton, compared with US $600–800 per ton for fossil jet fuel. This gap is mainly due to feedstock prices, hydrogen requirements, and refinery investments.

Even so, the market outlook is promising. HEFA continues to dominate production, while FT-SPK and ATJ-SPK are moving into commercial stages. Policies such as subsidies, carbon credits, blending mandates, and long-term offtake contracts are essential to make SAF financially viable and accelerate deployment globally, including in Indonesia.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents a vital milestone in the clean-energy transition of the aviation sector.

It allows aircraft to maintain optimal performance while significantly reducing carbon emissions.

Indonesia has already taken its first steps through technology development, pilot projects, and a long-term implementation roadmap. While cost and supply challenges remain, consistent regulations, green investments, and strong partnerships across sectors can help SAF become a key driver for sustainable air travel. The journey toward cleaner skies has already begun and SAF is the fuel that will take us there.",https://ecadin.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SAF-Illustration-2.webp,N,,2025-10-24 16:56:19.228880

But despite this momentum, one major challenge continues to hold back large-scale deployment: bankability.
Many SAF projects still struggle to secure low-cost debt, even when offtakers are willing to commit.

SAF projects that provide greater carbon intensity reductions or provide additional sustainability outcomes should be able to both reap and distribute the benefits of their innovation.","Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is widely viewed as the most viable way to cut aviation emissions. But despite this momentum, one major challenge continues to hold back large-scale deployment: bankability.

Many SAF projects still struggle to secure low-cost debt, even when offtakers are willing to commit. This playbook lays out five practical insights to help buyers, developers, and financiers design offtake structures and supporting infrastructure that make SAF projects more investable:

Corporate clients enable risk-sharing and unlock scale. Thanks to book and claim systems, new buyers are beginning to step up with firm, multi-year commitments. Continued collaboration on commercial contract innovation can further improve project bankability.

Contracts should give lenders what they need. Policy risk buffers, standardized product requirements, and long-term, take-or-pay offtake structures with creditworthy counterparties all play a role in attracting project financing.

Book and Claim transfer can power SAF deals. Robust, transparent EAC tracking is essential for investors to count on cash flows. Existing platforms like RSB and the SAFc registry are a starting point, and continuing initiatives to standardize transfers will build market confidence.

Tradability is the goal, not commoditization. SAF projects that provide greater carbon intensity reductions or provide additional sustainability outcomes should be able to both reap and distribute the benefits of their innovation.

Contracted cashflow stability for both EACs and physical fuel is critical. Savvy commercial agreements can create cashflow stability for two of the biggest revenue streams available to SAF projects, and there are blue skies for contract innovation in the sector.

This document provides design principles that stakeholders can use to build a SAF contracting ecosystem that supports real long-term investment. With better alignment across the value chain, we can mobilize capital faster and accelerate the transition to low-carbon aviation.

The company’s Controlled Microbial Upcycling (CMU) process aims to tackle some of the biggest barriers to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. Using AI-driven synthetic biology, the method converts multiple waste streams into low-cost, drop-in jet fuel, leveraging existing biogas and refinery infrastructure.

“Aviation is the most emissions-intensive mode of transport. SAFs offer a drop-in solution to decarbonise the sector, yet they currently account for less than 1% of jet fuel usage,” said Dr Deepanshu Singh, researcher in sustainable aviation and Business Development Lead at the Aviation Impact Accelerator (AIA).

“Our CMU process tackles scale-up challenges by using diverse feedstocks, replacing energy-intensive steps with low-cost microbial action, and utilising existing infrastructure. This makes our pathway both scalable and cost-effective.”

Unlike traditional SAF methods, which often rely on crops grown on arable land, CMU avoids competition for food, land, and water while reducing production costs.

Collaboration with University of Cambridge to Accelerate SAF

The funding will support a five-month feasibility study in collaboration with the Aviation Impact Accelerator at the Whittle Laboratory, University of Cambridge. The project will focus on producing carbon-negative fatty acids through the CMU process and includes technoeconomic analysis and lifecycle emissions assessments to evaluate its viability for sustainable aviation fuel production.

“Our modelling capability at the AIA not only informs policy but also guides smarter investment decisions,” said Dr Singh. “By linking this with cutting-edge companies like Neela Biotech, we are helping accelerate the industries of the future.”

AI and Microbial Engineering Driving Innovation

Co-founder Friederike Nintzel, a Marie Curie PhD fellow in synthetic biology, explained:

“Our approach has only recently become feasible thanks to advances in microbiome engineering and AI-driven bio-process design. With airlines setting net zero targets and SAF mandates increasing globally, the demand for sustainable aviation fuel has never been higher.”

Signed at the International Air Transport Association (IATA) World Sustainability Symposium in Hong Kong, this collaboration represents more than capital. It’s a direct statement of intent.

The partners are positioning themselves to help shape several elements:

Which technologies mature first

Which markets scale fastest

How Asia closes its gap with North America and Europe in SAF supply

Establishing a New SAF Hotspot

Europe and the US have primarily led the charge with large-scale SAF mandates and production. This has left Asia somewhat behind in terms of commercialization. With news like this and other developments in SAF investment, that climate is changing fast.

Singapore’s SAF mandate begins in 2026, and South Korea will follow in 2025. In these two countries alone, this already will create immediate demand for sustainable fuel pathways.

Airbus and Cathay’s investment comes at a crucial moment. Regulatory frameworks are just starting to form and early-stage technologies seek funding to move from lab to plant. Their partnership could play a critical role in ensuring Asia develops its own regional SAF supply chain rather than relying on imports.

Building Policy and Partnerships

Another critical piece of this partnership lies in policy advocacy. Airbus and Cathay intend to use their collective influence to push for regulatory clarity, incentives, and regional collaboration. Each one of these factors is essential to making SAF commercially viable.

Despite Asia’s abundant feedstock potential, including waste oils and residues to agricultural byproducts, production remains fragmented. Without consistent frameworks, investment can stall. Coordinated advocacy could change that, helping align governments, refiners, and airlines toward a shared decarbonization pathway.

Lessons From the Past

Both Airbus and Cathay have invested in SAF before, through funds, partnerships, and offtake agreements. However, these initiatives have yielded limited tangible output thus far. The challenge has primarily come in way of logistics like scalability and economics.

This new initiative could mark a shift in approach. The way ahead comes through targeted, early-stage funding focused on technology validation and paired with policy collaboration. By backing credible innovators and pressing for cohesive regional policy, the two firms could help unlock a more robust SAF ecosystem across Asia.

Investing in Long-Term Strategy

The Airbus–Cathay partnership represents a strategic investment in the technologies and partnerships that will define Asia’s next phase of aviation decarbonization. Rather than a short-term play for output, it’s a deliberate move to accelerate innovation and de-risk emerging SAF pathways with the greatest potential to scale.

By supporting early-stage projects with credible technology and strong fundamentals, the two companies are positioning themselves to shape the direction of SAF development. This includes steps from technology selection all the way to supply chain integration.

These collaborations open the door to future offtake agreements and long-term production partnerships once technologies mature.

The investment isn’t just about today’s capacity, either. It’s about securing a leadership role in the evolving sustainable aviation ecosystem and ensuring Asia has a strong foundation for the decades of SAF growth ahead.

A Turning Point for Asia’s Aviation Future

The aviation industry’s net-zero by 2050 goal hinges on SAF’s success. The IATA estimates that 65% of aviation’s emissions reduction will come from SAF adoption alone—a monumental target requiring trillions in cumulative investment.

Asia cannot afford to be a bystander in that race. This Airbus–Cathay partnership reflects a big change in SAF’s global reach. It signals Asia’s further shift from market observer to active participant in the global SAF transformation.

“This partnership is an excellent example of how cross-industry collaboration can unlock meaningful progress,” said Harry Sommer, president and chief executive officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. “Securing long-term access to renewable marine fuels at a key European port aligns directly with our Sail & Sustain® program and demonstrates our commitment to advancing towards a more sustainable future.”

“This milestone agreement highlights that renewable fuels are ready to play a key role in reducing the carbon footprint of the maritime sector. By partnering with NCLH, one of the world’s leading cruise companies, we show that renewable fuels are already deployable at scale to immediately start reducing emissions at sea,” said Juan Abascal, Repsol’s Executive Managing Director for Industrial Transformation and Circular Economy.

The agreement between NCLH and Repsol was established based on the changing international regulatory environment and both companies’ pursuit of Net Zero by 2050. All fuels provided under the agreement are certified under the ISCC EU framework and meet the standards necessary to support NCLH’s environmental compliance and decarbonization roadmap.

The renewable methanol will be produced at Repsol’s Ecoplanta facility in Tarragona (Spain), a pioneering project in Europe to transform urban waste into renewable fuels and circular products, adding a solution for reducing CO₂ emissions in the transport sector, while at the same time promoting the circular economy. The new plant—set to begin operations in 2029— will have the capacity to process up to 400,000 tons of municipal solid waste per year and turn them into 240,000 tons of renewable fuels and circular products. NCLH is the first company to sign an offtake agreement for renewable methanol from the Ecoplanta facility.

This alliance underscores NCLH’s commitment to advancing low-carbon fuel solutions and supporting the circular economy, while maintaining operational flexibility and cost efficiency across its fleet. It also directly supports the company’s global program, Sail & Sustain®, a company-wide initiative focused on reducing greenhouse gas intensity, investing in innovative fuel solutions, and fostering collaboration across the value chain. As part of its 2026 “Charting the Course” targets, the company is working to achieve a 10 percent reduction in GHG intensity by 2026 and 25 percent by 2030.1

Renewable fuels are central to Repsol’s strategy to supply solutions to cut CO₂ emissions across all transport sectors. They are an already available alternative for decarbonizing current and future vehicles, without the need to change engines or modify existing distribution and refueling infrastructures.

US ethanol production remains steady through 2026. Rising profits and new marine fuel demand could boost corn usage and benefit rural plants. Trade tensions with Brazil and slowed biofuel projects highlight sector uncertainties despite oil majors’ continued investments.

EIA Projects Stable US Ethanol Production

According to the October 7 Short-Term Energy Outlook from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), forecasts for 2025 and 2026 fuel ethanol blending and exports were unchanged from the previous report. Fuel ethanol production also remained unchanged.

The EIA said fuel ethanol production is expected to average 1.06 million barrels per day this year and next year, unchanged from the September report. Production also averaged 1.06 million barrels per day in 2024.

On a quarterly basis, the EIA currently expects fuel ethanol production to average 1.05 million barrels per day during the fourth quarter of 2025. In 2026, production is forecast to average 1.05 million barrels per day in the first quarter, 1.07 million barrels per day in the second quarter, 1.05 million barrels per day in the third quarter, and 1.08 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter.

Source: EIA

Net imports of fuel ethanol are expected to average 130,000 barrels per day in both 2025 and 2026, unchanged from 2024 and from the September outlook.

Ethanol Gains from Rising Margins and Marine Fuel Demand

Profit margins are seeing a slight uptick, giving the US ethanol industry a modest boost. A Kansas State University agricultural economist says the sector remains a major corn consumer, using about 35% of the nation’s crop each year.

Global shipping is also eyeing lower-carbon fuels, and the International Maritime Organization’s proposed Net-Zero Framework could open a significant new outlet for US ethanol, biodiesel and renewable diesel.

Geoff Cooper of the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) noted that oceangoing vessels burn roughly 70–80 billion gallons of fuel annually. Capturing just 5% of that market with US biofuels could create demand for 4–5 billion gallons, translating to more than 1.5 billion bushels of additional corn use — a potential economic boost for rural plants and farms.

The Department of Energy estimates that corn ethanol can cut marine GHG emissions by about 61%, soy biodiesel by 66%, and soy renewable diesel by 60% compared with bunker fuel, enabling ships to earn compliance credits if the rule is implemented as proposed in 2027.

US Ethanol Production Rises as Maintenance Ends

US ethanol production moved slightly higher over the past week as more facilities concluded seasonal maintenance. The EIA reported production at 1.074 million barrels per day, the highest average in more than a month — up 3,000 barrels from the previous week and 32,000 barrels from a year earlier.

Iowa State University’s Center for Agricultural and Rural Development said estimated operating margins for the typical Iowa plant remained solidly positive. Demand signals were mixed, with ethanol stocks at 22.628 million barrels, down 92,000 barrels from the previous week but up 353,000 barrels year over year.

The Renewable Fuels Association noted that net ethanol inputs purchased by refiners and blenders rose even as gasoline supplied to the market declined. Ethanol exports averaged 108,000 barrels per day, down 30,000 barrels from the prior week and 32,000 barrels from a year ago.

US-Brazil Ethanol Trade Talks Progress

The Brazilian president has established a roadmap that could lead to a reduction in tariffs on US ethanol amid an ongoing trade dispute, according to local media reports. Brazilian and US officials were scheduled to meet on October 16, with Brazil expected to consider US requests to reinstate an ethanol quota system or create new incentives for US imports, Brazilagro reported.

Since 2020, Brazil has maintained an 18% tariff on US ethanol, a policy that has frustrated US producers, given that Brazilian ethanol can enter the US with a 2.5% de minimis tariff. Previously, US producers could ship up to 600 million litres of ethanol duty-free under a tariff-rate quota system, above which the tariff rose to 20%.

The Office of the US Trade Representative launched a trade investigation into Brazil in July, citing high tariffs on US ethanol exports, digital payments restrictions, unfair trade practices, corruption and deforestation concerns.

Biofuel Project Rollouts Stall

Just last year, several oil majors appeared to be betting heavily on biofuels, but momentum seems to have slowed in project development in recent months. Despite strong demand for biofuels — as hard-to-abate industries seek to decarbonise — increased uncertainty and other logistical challenges have caused new project rollouts to stall in several regions.

By the end of 2024, several oil majors had increased investments in biofuel development, with a focus on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

At that time, 43 projects were expected to be operational by 2030, according to Rystad Energy.

Australia is rapidly emerging as a key market for renewable fuels. A Deloitte report commissioned by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation identifies a AUD$36 billion opportunity to develop a world-leading low-carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) industry. This sector could reduce emissions by 230 million tons by 2050 while strengthening Australia’s energy independence.

Currently, Australia imports approximately 80% of its liquid fuels, spending over AUD$50 billion in 2023, while exporting AUD$3.9 billion worth of potential LCLF feedstocks. With onshore fuel reserves of less than 50 days—well below the International Energy Agency’s recommended 90 days—the nation remains highly dependent on imports, leaving it vulnerable to global supply disruptions.

To address this imbalance, the Australian federal government has prioritized low-carbon liquid fuels through its Future Made in Australia initiative. The AUD$1.7 billion Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund is available to support the growth of a domestic LCLF industry, including SAF and renewable diesel.

Growing airline commitments to net-zero emissions, led by Qantas and Virgin Australia, are expected to drive strong demand for locally produced SAF, creating significant investment and development momentum in the region.

This partnership marks a key milestone in XCF’s global expansion strategy, which focuses on capital-efficient, regionally tailored collaborations to accelerate worldwide SAF adoption. It builds on the June 2025 Memorandum of Understanding with Continual Renewable Ventures Pty. Ltd., which laid the groundwork for today’s binding agreement.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global said, “Our partnership with New Rise AU accelerates XCF’s global growth strategy and highlights the scalability of our modular renewable fuel platform. Australia’s favorable policy environment, growing aviation sector, and abundant feedstock resources make it an ideal market for renewable fuel production. Through New Rise AU, we are bringing our platform to a new market, enabling rapid expansion, efficient capital use, and supporting Australia’s clean energy transition. This collaboration demonstrates how XCF transforms opportunities into real-world impact, opening markets and driving sustainable growth.”

Renzo Petersen, CEO of New Rise AU said that New Rise Australia represents a true collaboration between XCF Global and Continual Renewables, united by a shared vision to decarbonize aviation. By combining XCF’s modular site design with Continual Renewable’s local expertise, we aim to establish a self-sustaining renewable fuel industry in Australia that attracts investment, creates jobs, and advances energy independence. This partnership demonstrates how collaboration can translate into capability, and how that capability can power Australia’s clean energy future.

The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation marks a pivotal step toward transforming Europe’s aviation landscape. The first Annual Technical Report by EASA, released in 2025, captures the progress made by fuel suppliers, airports, and aircraft operators as they prepare to meet sustainability goals. This initial report establishes the all-important baseline from 2024, offering a clear picture of where the industry stands as it begins this crucial transition.

Key Insights from the Report

The data paints a story of progress mixed with opportunity. About two-thirds of fuel suppliers and three-quarters of operators submitted their reports, revealing that 193 kilotonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) were supplied, representing 0.6% of total aviation fuel. SAF helped reduce lifecycle emissions by approximately 91%, avoiding over 700 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents.

Most SAF currently comes from biofuels, primarily derived from used cooking oil, with a majority of feedstocks imported from Asia. Encouragingly, 25 suppliers are already providing SAF to 33 airports across 12 EU member states, proving that market foundations are steadily strengthening.

Looking Ahead

EASA’s projections suggest that by 2030, EU production of SAF could reach between 1.4 and 5.9 million tonnes, depending on investment momentum and technology adoption. Meeting the 6% SAF target appears achievable, though synthetic fuel development remains a challenge.

Conclusion

The Annual Technical Report is more than a compliance document; it is a mirror reflecting Europe’s readiness for cleaner skies. As momentum builds, collaboration among regulators, producers, and operators will be vital to translate ambition into measurable climate impact.

Seen as the most viable near-term solution for decarbonizing civil aviation, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) now faces a critical challenge: despite broad industry consensus and high expectations, widespread replacement of conventional fossil fuel remains distant, hindered by scaling difficulties and cost barriers.

According to statistics, there are currently 16 sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects in Chinese mainland, with eight already operational. Global SAF production capacity should reach 1 million tons in 2025 and 2 million tons in 2026, Xie Xingquan, regional vice president for North Asia with the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

""Although the capacity is doubling, it can only meet a very small portion of the airlines' demand,"" Xie warned.

The remarks were made at the World Safety & Operations Conference held in Xiamen, East China's Fujian Province earlier this month.

SAF is a liquid aviation fuel alternative to traditional jet fuel. Made from renewable materials, it can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 percent over the fuel's life cycle compared to conventional jet fuel.

A study released by IATA, in partnership with Worley Consulting in September, demonstrating that sufficient SAF feedstock exists to enable the airline industry to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. All feedstocks considered meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use.

While, the study identified significant barriers in using that feedstock for SAF production, including the slow pace of technology rollout that would enable SAF to be produced from varied sources.

Airlines will need 500 million tons of SAF to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as outlined in the IATA Net Zero Roadmaps.

To maximize SAF output, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology roll-out, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions.

""Currently, HEFA-SAF (Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids-based SAF), which relies on oils and waste fats, accounts for the majority of the market share, with costs approximately 3-4 times that of conventional jet fuel, according to news outlet China Times, citing IATA's Director of Energy Transition.

The IATA believes that utilizing existing feedstocks for SAF production faces a series of obstacles. One of the biggest issues is the slow progress in technology promotion, which restricts the development of producing SAF through multiple feedstock pathways.

As decarbonization becomes a core agenda across various industries, the demand for SAF is not solely coming from the aviation transport sector. Available biomass feedstocks also face competition from other industries.

On Tuesday, the Cathay Group and Airbus announced a joint investment agreement of up to $70 million to accelerate the development of SAF production in Asia and globally.

Under the terms of the partnership, the two companies will work to identify, evaluate and invest in projects that support the scaling of SAF production toward 2030 and beyond. Projects will be assessed based on their commercial viability, technological maturity, and potential for long-term offtake.

From IATA's perspective, policies must prioritize allocating feedstocks to hard-to-abate sectors like aviation. As outlined in IATA's Net Zero Carbon Emissions Roadmap, airlines will need 500 million tons of SAF to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

One direct consequence of production capacity constraints is the persistently high cost of usage. For the aviation transportation industry, which generally operates on low profit margins, this is one of the main reasons why airlines are not very proactive in scaling up the use of SAF.

To break the ""deadlock"" the aviation industry faces regarding SAF, international industry organizations like IATA have been actively engaging with various stakeholders, including regulatory bodies, the aviation and energy sectors, and research institutions.

In IATA's latest report, North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN have been identified as the key regions for global SAF production.

""We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritized then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry's path to decarbonization. There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry's growth. We need shovels in the ground now,"" said Willie Walsh, IATA's Director General.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2024/2024-11-11/a4fc5236-d191-49f2-a4e1-97c5c57d13e1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-24 09:01:31.451141

We remain committed to helping our customers reduce emissions by scaling SAF production and supply.” This agreement builds on the long-standing collaboration between Neste and United.
Neste has supplied SAF to United at Chicago O’Hare International Airport since August 2024, following the introduction of a SAF purchase credit in Illinois, making United the first airline to use SAF at that airport.
Additionally, Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel has been used by United at San Francisco International Airport, supported by California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS).","Neste and United Airlines have extended their partnership to provide sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at three additional major U.S. airports. Under the new agreement, United becomes the first commercial airline to use SAF for flights departing from George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in New Jersey, and Dulles International Airport (IAD) in Washington D.C.

As part of the deal, Neste will supply neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ to United, which will then be blended with conventional jet fuel to meet standard jet fuel specifications.

SAF deliveries to George Bush Airport began in July 2025 and are scheduled to continue through October 2025. Deliveries to Newark and Dulles airports started in September 2025 and will run until the end of the year. The fuel is transported to each airport using existing pipeline infrastructure from Neste’s SAF terminal facilities in Houston.

“Introducing sustainable aviation fuel for the first time at our hubs in Houston, Newark, and Dulles is another significant milestone in United’s sustainability journey,” said United Chief Sustainability Officer Lauren Riley. “While United remains the leading SAF user in the U.S., having used over 4,300 metric tons (13 million gallons) last year, we understand that expanding the SAF market requires support from state and federal governments. We will continue collaborating with partners like Neste to encourage policymakers to implement market incentives that promote lower-carbon energy.”

Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President of Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste, added: “We are excited to help United Airlines expand SAF use to new U.S. markets. It is vital that more states adopt proven incentive policies to accelerate SAF production and support the aviation industry in achieving its ambitious net-zero carbon goal by 2050.

The China Fusion Energy deal somewhat misleadingly pushed the averages up for 2025, to $68.35m.
Over the past decade, cleantech has been the single biggest investment sector for many of the oil and gas majors.
Despite having three times as many rounds as in the first or second quarters of 2025, Q3 still has as few transport rounds as any quarter since Q4 2021.","Venture spending by oil and gas companies in Q3 was dominated by one big fusion deal – the $1.6bn round for China Fusion Energy, which brought the total dollars invested to $2.06bn.

With the China Fusion Energy deal, the total disclosed amount raised in rounds was more than triple the number of venture capital dollars spent in the third quarter of last year. Without that one outlier, however, we see one of the lowest amounts of disclosed dollars invested in the past few years.

Fusion has been a big theme for investors over recent months, especially in the APAC region, where Japan’s Helical Fusion raised a $15.6m series A round and Linea Innovation, also in Japan, raised $12.2m. In the US, Commonwealth Fusion raised a $863m round from investors including Jera, Japan’s largest power company, Kansai Electric Power, and Mitsui OSK Lines, the transport company.

While these recent fusion funding rounds did not include investors from oil and gas companies, earlier in the year Chevron Technology Ventures backed the $150m funding round for fusion startup TAE Technologies, and Chevron and Shell Ventures both backed fusion company Zap Energy at the end of last year.

Overall, cleantech is, as ever, the biggest single segment drawing venture investment from oil majors, with IT still holding its usual second-place spot. Some of the bigger cleantech deals include a $47m Equinor-backed series B for Lithium de France which is developing environmentally-friendly lithium extraction and a $28m series B round for sustainable aviation fuel company OXCCU that was backed by Saudi Aramco and Eni Group.

Transport and mobility, which usually gets several investments every quarter from the big oil companies, has fallen off in 2025, with no quarter seeing more than three rounds in the sector.

So far this year, most subsectors are down from the year before in terms of number of oil and gas company-backed rounds, with the exception of advanced materials and chemicals.

Startups like Radical AI, the AI-aided advanced materials developer that raised a $55m round, backed by Eni Group along with corporates like Nvidia and Raytheon Technologies, showcases AI’s continued inroads into every subsector. Meanwhile India’s deep tech materials developer Chakr Innovation also got an investment from the likes of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation.

Cleantech and IT are both on track to potentially surpass last year’s numbers if the fourth quarter continues current trends.

The average size of a funding round involving oil and gas investors has been falling since 2022. The China Fusion Energy deal somewhat misleadingly pushed the averages up for 2025, to $68.35m. However, taking out the outliers, the median round size is similar to the previous two years.

Over the past decade, cleantech has been the single biggest investment sector for many of the oil and gas majors. One notable exception has been Saudi Aramco, which has invested in twice as many rounds in IT than in cleantech as it has worked to digitise and modernise its systems.

Shell and BP, both of which have made big bets on electric vehicle charging infrastructure, have transport and mobility as their second biggest investment target since 2014, though BPs investment is the smallest of these major players at it has slowed down its activity over the past year or so.

Within the cleantech space, oil and gas corporates seem to have rediscovered their interest in hydrogen, with Q3 2025 seeing as many hydrogen investments by the peer group as there had been up to the same point last year.

Investment in startups such as hydrogen and natural gas recovery systems developer Sapphire Technologies’ Equinor-backed $18m series C, as well as the Woodside Energy-backed $7m seed round for electrolyser manufacturer Stargate Technologies, have pushed up the numbers. Energy sector investments in hydrogen are on track to surpass any year since at least 2020 if this trend continues.

On the other hand, carbon capture and energy storage, which both saw a lot of activity over the past two years, have seen their deal numbers go down in 2025.

Transport startups seem to have had the biggest fall from favour among oil and gas corporates. Despite having three times as many rounds as in the first or second quarters of 2025, Q3 still has as few transport rounds as any quarter since Q4 2021.

Transport may have seen weak investment numbers, but it had one of the biggest exits of the quarter, when public mobility platform provider Via went public in a $493m IPO, providing exits for Shell, alongside other corporates including Bank Hapaolim, Hearst, Koch Industries and Daimler.",https://globalventuring.com/content/uploads/2025/10/CVC-in-numbers-2.png,N,,2025-10-24 09:01:41.275878

Its report, ‘Airport expansion and climate and nature targets,’ concludes that allowing airport growth under existing conditions will make achieving environmental goals significantly more difficult and more expensive.
The report calls on the government to clarify how it will meet its climate, environmental and biodiversity commitments while pursuing airport expansion.
But are they yet ready to be the basis for justifying this level of aviation expansion?
The Committee concluded that without a more coherent strategy, the government risks undermining both its climate targets and the credibility of its broader net zero commitments.","A new report from MPs has criticised the UK government’s approach to managing the environmental impact of aviation while supporting airport expansion. The report argues that it risks putting the UK’s net zero targets in “serious jeopardy.”

The cross-party Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) has warned that current policies are not sufficient to reduce emissions from aviation in line with the UK’s legally binding carbon budgets. Its report, ‘Airport expansion and climate and nature targets,’ concludes that allowing airport growth under existing conditions will make achieving environmental goals significantly more difficult and more expensive.

While ministers argue that expanding airport capacity can support economic growth, the Committee found that the government has not presented robust evidence to show that the economic benefits would outweigh the environmental costs. Approvals already granted for expansion at Stansted, Luton and Gatwick were cited as examples of decisions made without a sufficient evidence base.

The report also raises concerns that the government’s Jet Zero Strategy relies heavily on future technological developments, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), to deliver large carbon savings. The MPs note that these technologies have yet to be proven at commercial scale and that the projected costs of emission abatement are significantly higher than current levels.

Ministers have rejected measures to limit air travel demand, such as capping the number of flights, which the Climate Change Committee has previously identified as a potential tool to reduce emissions. The EAC said the government must explain what alternative measures it plans to use to stay within environmental limits.

MPs also criticised the government for proceeding with expansion before updating the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS), which dates back to 2018. The Committee said relying on an outdated framework means expansion plans are not being properly assessed against current climate and nature targets.

The report calls on the government to clarify how it will meet its climate, environmental and biodiversity commitments while pursuing airport expansion. It recommends setting this out alongside the forthcoming update to the ANPS, and before any further major expansion projects progress.

EAC Chair Toby Perkins MP said:

Expanding airport capacity is likely to make that task much harder. Under the government’s existing Jet Zero Strategy, expanding airport capacity is likely to put net zero at serious risk, unless it is accompanied by a serious strategic approach to increasing the pace of decarbonising aviation.

Having ruled out the kind of demand management measures likely to seriously reduce emissions, ministers need to make clear what alternative tools they are willing to use to ensure targets are met. New technological developments are promising and may in time provide an alternative route forward. But are they yet ready to be the basis for justifying this level of aviation expansion?

The Committee concluded that without a more coherent strategy, the government risks undermining both its climate targets and the credibility of its broader net zero commitments.

China Airlines has set a new standard for sustainable aviation by integrating Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in SkyTeam’s ‘Aviation Challenge,’ leading the way for greener practices in Thailand.
This milestone demonstrates the airline’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions and fostering a more eco-friendly aviation future.
Through its comprehensive approach to sustainability, China Airlines is setting a powerful example for others in the sector to follow.","China Airlines has set a new industry standard for sustainable aviation by successfully integrating Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into its operations, marking a significant achievement in SkyTeam’s ‘Aviation Challenge.’ This milestone positions China Airlines at the forefront of the aviation industry’s push toward reducing carbon emissions, particularly in Thailand, where the airline has been actively promoting environmentally friendly practices. By embracing SAF, a fuel produced from renewable resources that significantly cuts carbon emissions compared to traditional jet fuel, China Airlines is not only contributing to a greener future but also paving the way for other SkyTeam members and the global aviation sector to follow suit. This move reflects the airline’s commitment to sustainability and its proactive role in driving change within the industry, making it a key player in the fight against climate change.

China Airlines recently marked a major achievement in its ongoing commitment to sustainability with the operation of its next-generation, fuel-efficient A350-900 aircraft, demonstrating a significant leap forward in reducing aviation carbon emissions. The airline took a bold step towards its sustainability goals by fueling its outbound flight with a record 40% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), setting a new benchmark for its TAC (Technical and Commercial) demonstration flights. This milestone underscores the airline’s continued efforts to incorporate SAF into its operations, with the aim of significantly lowering carbon emissions associated with air travel.

The groundbreaking flight, operated between Taoyuan and Bangkok, was made possible through a strong collaboration with CPC Corporation, Taiwan. This partnership provided the 7.7 metric tons of SAF required for the flight, marking a significant development in Taiwan’s SAF production. The achievement represents a key milestone in the island nation’s efforts to enhance its sustainable aviation fuel capacity and contribute to global emissions reduction targets.

The use of 40% SAF on this flight marks a major step forward for China Airlines, as it continues to prioritize SAF as a critical element of its long-term sustainability strategy. By incorporating SAF, the airline is contributing to a future where air travel plays a much smaller role in global carbon emissions. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% when compared to conventional jet fuel, making it one of the most effective solutions for reducing aviation’s environmental footprint.

This move to use SAF is part of China Airlines’ broader strategy to demonstrate leadership in sustainable aviation. The airline has been a long-time promoter of SAF and has focused its efforts on encouraging both public and private sectors to invest in the development of sustainable fuel solutions for the aviation industry. As part of its ongoing commitment to sustainability, China Airlines has emphasized the importance of partnerships with other industry stakeholders, including government entities and academic institutions, to accelerate the widespread adoption of SAF.

The return flight of the same journey, flight CI832 from Bangkok to Taipei, also showcased China Airlines’ commitment to sustainability through international cooperation in the SAF supply chain. For this return leg, SAF was sourced from Thailand’s PTTOR, marking the first time that SAF produced outside Taiwan was utilized on a China Airlines flight. This international collaboration highlights the airline’s global approach to building a sustainable aviation ecosystem that transcends national borders and brings together resources from across the world.

China Airlines has indicated that this collaboration is just the beginning. The airline plans to expand its SAF partnerships and is actively engaging with both governmental and non-governmental organizations to create a more robust SAF supply chain, especially for long-haul flights. This expansion is expected to improve accessibility to SAF, making it easier for airlines around the world to integrate sustainable aviation fuel into their operations. The airline’s long-term objective is to normalize the use of SAF in daily operations and contribute to broader aviation industry goals of reducing carbon emissions.

Beyond fuel use, China Airlines has also taken steps to enhance the sustainability of its in-flight services. The airline introduced a range of environmentally friendly initiatives aimed at reducing waste and carbon footprint across its cabin and catering services. These initiatives include the introduction of electronic menus across all classes, which eliminates the need for paper-based materials, and the use of stainless steel cutlery in Economy Class to reduce single-use plastics. Additionally, the airline has adopted recycled PET (rPET) materials for items such as tray lids, cups, pillow covers, headrest covers, and lavatory containers. These actions reflect China Airlines’ commitment to sustainability across all aspects of its operations, from fuel to in-flight service.

In line with its broader environmental goals, China Airlines is also implementing carbon reduction measures on the ground. The airline has incorporated electric tractors into its ground operations to reduce emissions associated with airport logistics. Furthermore, it has introduced an electronic cargo-handling system designed to minimize paper consumption and improve overall efficiency. These initiatives reflect China Airlines’ understanding that sustainability is not limited to the skies but extends to every facet of its operations, including the ground services that support its flights.

The state had roughly 50 refineries in 1980; today, there are 13 operating refineries as of January 1, 2025, according to federal data, reflecting a structural decline even as California’s unique fuel standards keep supply tight and imports complicated.
These moves were celebrated as climate wins, but they also reduced in-state gasoline production and increased dependence on gasoline imports tailored to California’s boutique blend.
Lawmakers advanced measures to expand oil production approvals in the San Joaquin Valley and bolster fuel supply resilience to counter planned refinery closures.
California’s energy system is evolving, and the EV mandate is gone.","California’s leaders spent years promising an expedited break from fossil fuels, but the state is discovering a hard truth: gasoline and diesel still underpin day-to-day life, and California will keep relying on oil even as it builds out alternatives. Thirteen refineries remain in operation today, with only a shrinking subset still making California-specific gasoline, and policymakers are now quietly adjusting to keep fuel flowing and prices from spiking further. The politics may be loud, but the math is louder. California cannot phase out refineries faster than it can replace their output without triggering volatility at the pump, supply risks, and serious economic fallout.

For decades, refinery capacity has consolidated while demand shocks and environmental requirements have intensified California’s vulnerability to price spikes. The state had roughly 50 refineries in 1980; today, there are 13 operating refineries as of January 1, 2025, according to federal data, reflecting a structural decline even as California’s unique fuel standards keep supply tight and imports complicated. This consolidation means outages or conversions at a few large facilities can ripple through the market immediately, and it’s a major reason regulators and lawmakers are recalibrating their approach in 2025.

A turning point came as several Bay Area and Southern California plants exited petroleum gasoline production to focus on renewable fuels, led by the full conversion of Phillips 66’s Rodeo complex and the Marathon Martinez transition to renewable diesel. These moves were celebrated as climate wins, but they also reduced in-state gasoline production and increased dependence on gasoline imports tailored to California’s boutique blend. The net effect is a tighter market with less buffer, especially during maintenance or unexpected outages, and that raised alarm inside Sacramento about supply security.

By mid-to-late 2025, the state’s own energy officials acknowledged the risk of rapid refinery exits. A joint legislative oversight analysis documented conversions and announced closures, warning of near-term supply constraints and likely price increases as California imports more finished fuel and stabilizes in-state production to bridge the transition. Policymakers began to favor measures that keep existing refineries operating and maintain minimum inventories, not because the state is abandoning climate goals, but because it needs a managed glide path rather than a cliff.

The most visible policy reversal was the pause on implementing a refinery “excess profit” penalty. Initially touted as a landmark accountability tool, regulators delayed enforcement until 2030 after two large facilities representing a substantial share of capacity signaled shutdown plans. The California Energy Commission explicitly linked the pause to fuel reliability and consumer protection, underlining that a rushed punitive regime could accelerate exits and worsen price shocks before alternatives are ready at scale. It was a victory for practical reliability over rhetoric—and a recognition of how sensitive the fuel market has become.

Governor Gavin Newsom’s administration has also shifted posture toward industry engagement as gasoline prices remain a political and economic pressure point. Internal guidance and public remarks emphasized stabilizing the state’s gasoline supply, increasing fuel imports to make up for refinery closures, and supporting in-state production in legacy basins like Kern County to reduce volatility. The message to refiners has been blunt: California believes they can profitably operate here because demand will persist for years, even as the state accelerates clean energy buildout. That practical stance is now informing legislation and regulatory guidance.

Legislative action has followed the same arc. Lawmakers advanced measures to expand oil production approvals in the San Joaquin Valley and bolster fuel supply resilience to counter planned refinery closures. This is not a U-turn on climate policy; it’s an admission that an orderly transition requires a reliable supply and an industrial base capable of meeting residual demand while alternative fuels and infrastructure scale. Without that bridge, California risks importing more fuel from jurisdictions with weaker standards and losing high-wage industrial jobs and local tax revenue before replacement industries are ready.

California must have base load energy and gas or risk continuous rolling brownouts and blackouts. They can’t rely on solar and wind, as they can only support 18% of the state’s needs. Let’s hope other states are watching and do not follow California’s lead.

Even as petroleum production declines, refiners are not exiting energy altogether. Rodeo’s renewable conversion is now producing around 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel capability, while being partially powered by solar and using waste-based recycling. Marathon Martinez’s conversion followed a similar path after navigating lawsuits and environmental approvals, illustrating the complex, costly, and time-consuming reality of repurposing production. These projects prove transition is possible—but they also underscore why the state cannot afford supply holes while conversions come online.

Analysts warn of broader economic stakes in refinery reduction transition. The Bay Area’s refinery belt impacts thousands of jobs, municipal tax bases, and supply chains, and closures trigger cascading problems —from worker displacement to cleanup liabilities. Those risks explain why policymakers are now threading a needle: encouraging conversions and emissions reductions while maintaining enough petroleum capacity to prevent costly disruptions for consumers and businesses. That is the shape of California’s “managed transition” in 2025, and it’s more cautious than activists expected. The result could be disastrous if they follow the original plan.

So where does that leave the state and the 13 refineries? Regulators are easing off financial penalties that could cause abrupt shutdowns, expanding fuel options like higher-ethanol blends to cut prices, and coordinating with industry to ensure minimum inventories and smoother maintenance schedules. At the same time, California is approving conversions, enabling renewable diesel and oil production, and moving ahead on clean energy buildout. The signal is clear: keep the fossil backbone steady while the next-generation system ramps.

The political narrative—“battling Big Oil”—has met the operational reality of keeping 40 million residents and the world’s fifth-largest economy moving. California is not abandoning its climate trajectory, but it is recognizing the cost of moving faster than infrastructure, supply chains, and consumer adoption can support. The result is a wake-up call: partner with refineries to ensure stability, support conversions where feasible, and avoid creating a supply crunch that forces more expensive imports and higher costs to drivers. That is why California will keep fossil fuels for the foreseeable future.

The bottom line is that Governor Gavin Newsom is on his way out, along with his bad ideas and policies that cripple Californians. California’s energy system is evolving, and the EV mandate is gone. Gasoline and diesel remain essential, and refineries—whether petroleum or renewable—are the industrial spine of that system across the USA. Managing that reality means fewer price shocks, stronger reliability, and lower gas prices.

The MPs said ministers must set out how they are going to meet climate, environment and biodiversity targets while pursuing significant airport expansion and before any of the projects break ground.
Their report found that government policies were insufficient to cut carbon emissions from the aviation sector in line with targets.
Keir Starmer, the prime minister, and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have approved airport expansion in a desperate search for economic growth.
“The government must listen to the experts, scrap this reckless agenda of airport expansion, and instead invest in the everyday journeys which really matter to millions of us.”","Airport expansion plans backed by the government are putting the UK’s net zero target in “serious jeopardy”, MPs have warned.

Without new safeguards, proposals to enlarge airports including Heathrow and Gatwick could push the UK over its carbon budgets, according to a report from the cross-party Commons environmental audit committee.

The MPs said ministers must set out how they are going to meet climate, environment and biodiversity targets while pursuing significant airport expansion and before any of the projects break ground.

Their report found that government policies were insufficient to cut carbon emissions from the aviation sector in line with targets. It said demand for air travel was expected to rise, further putting the reduction plans in “serious jeopardy”.

Keir Starmer, the prime minister, and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have approved airport expansion in a desperate search for economic growth.

However, the committee said: “The government has not demonstrated that the economic growth from airport expansion provides enough benefit to outweigh the negative climate and environmental impacts it will lead to.”

The report also said ministers had ruled out measures to manage demand for aviation, such as limiting the number of flights. The MPs also warned that uptake of sustainable aviation fuel might not help cut emissions because it was not yet being used or produced on a commercial scale. Last year, Air New Zealand scrapped its 2030 decarbonisation target, blaming difficulties in securing sustainable fuel.

The expansion schemes are expected to start before the government updates its national policy statement on airports, released in 2018. The MPs said this meant the government was avoiding scrutiny and relying on “an outdated policy framework which is inconsistent with its objectives”.

Toby Perkins, the Labour chair of the committee, said: “Meeting our decarbonisation targets is already a major challenge. Expanding airport capacity is likely to make that task much harder. Under the government’s existing ‘jet zero’ strategy, expanding airport capacity is likely to put net zero at serious risk, unless it is accompanied by a serious strategic approach to increasing the pace of decarbonising aviation.

“Having ruled out the kind of demand management measures likely to seriously reduce emissions, ministers need to make clear what alternative tools they are willing to use to ensure targets are met.”

Alethea Warrington, the head of aviation at the climate charity Possible, said: “This is the final nail in the coffin for the government’s case for airport expansion. The government’s scrutiny committee has made it clearer than ever that airport growth is a bad option for Britain, and that the government simply doesn’t have any economic evidence to justify the environmental devastation this would cause.

“The government must listen to the experts, scrap this reckless agenda of airport expansion, and instead invest in the everyday journeys which really matter to millions of us.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67fca8b65a13573d89ad157c7c58e75cac620fed/322_0_4329_3463/master/4329.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f900c38201c7d72883d7e69741e1b63e",N,,2025-10-23 21:16:30.496643

The facility, which will produce renewable diesel and SAF, is expected to be operational in 2028.","Valero Energy Corp. on Oct. 23 released third quarter results, reporting a profitable three-month period for its ethanol segment on record high production. Valero’s renewable diesel segment, which also includes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), reported a loss for the period.

The ethanol segment reported $183 million in operating income for the third quarter, up from $153 million reported for the same period of last year. Valero primarily attributed the increase to higher ethanol and corn-related coproduct prices and increased production volumes, partially offset by higher corn prices and an increase in operating expenses.

Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.6 million gallons per day during the third quarter, achieving record production. Production volumes were up approximately 51,000 gallons per day when compared to the third quarter of 2024, according to Valero.

Ethanol production volumes for the first nine months of 2025 also averaged approximately 4.6 million gallons per day, up 54,000 gallons per day when compared to the same period of 2024.

During a third quarter earnings call, Valero Vice President of Investor Relations and Finance Homer Bhullar said the company’s ethanol segment is expected to continue to produce 4.6 million gallons per day during the fourth quarter.

Valero’s renewable diesel segment, which consists of the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture, reported an operating loss of $28 million for the third quarter, compared to operating income of $35 million reported for the same period of last year. The company primarily attributed the decrease to higher feedstock costs and a decrease in sales volumes, which were partially offset by higher product prices, particularly for renewable diesel.

The renewable diesel segment reported $719 million in revenues from external customers for the third quarter, including $623 million for renewable diesel, $29 million for renewable naphtha and $67 million for neat SAF. Revenues from external customers for the same period of last year were at $632 million, including $610 million for renewable diesel and $22 million for renewable naphtha. Valero did not report any revenues from external customers for SAF during the third quarter of 2024.

Renewable diesel segment sales volumes averaged 2.7 million gallons per day during the third quarter, down approximately 827,000 gallons per day when compared to the 3.5 million gallons per day of sales reported for the same period of last year.

Sales volumes for the first nine months of 2025 averaged 2.6 million gallons per day, down 959,000 gallons per day when compared to the 3.6 million gallons per day of sales reported for the same period of last year.

Bhullar said Valero expects sales volumes for the renewable diesel segment to be at approximately 258 million gallons for the fourth quarter, reflecting lower production due to economics.

The government has approved several airport expansion schemes, most recently a third runway at London Heathrow and a second runway at Gatwick.

The Department for Transport said airport expansion plans would ""only go ahead if it aligns with our legal obligations on climate change"".

The Environmental Audit Committee said the only prospect of meeting net zero would be if airport expansion was ""accompanied by a serious strategic approach to increasing the pace of decarbonising aviation"".

However, its chair Toby Perkin noted that technological solutions - such as sustainable aviation fuel - were not yet being used on a commercial scale.

The report said the plans were likely to provide some economic growth, but how much was unclear, and the government had not provided supporting evidence.

The UK has legally binding targets to reduce its levels of planet-warming emissions, and contribute to the global goal of preventing average temperatures rising by more than 1.5C by 2050.

Above this temperature level, scientists anticipate significant impacts from global sea level rise, more extreme weather and impacts on agriculture.

To prevent temperatures increasing there is a limit to the amount of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, that the world can release, and the UK has set out its own share of these – known as carbon budgets.

On Wednesday, the Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told Parliament that Heathrow's expansion plans ""must align with our legal, environmental and climate commitments"".

A spokesperson for the DfT said: ""We have been clear that airport expansion will only go ahead if it aligns with our legal obligations on climate change, including net zero, and we will be seeking advice from the independent Climate Change Committee to inform the ANPS review.""

But Dr Alex Chapman, a senior researcher at New Economics Foundation (a think tank focused on environmental and social policies) who gave evidence to the environmental audit committee, said the inquiry was a ""damning assessment of this government's airport expansion agenda"".

""This government is unable to produce evidence that supports their central claim: that growing our airports will grow our economy.

The cross-party Environmental Audit Committee has delivered its verdict on the government’s plans to expand several airports, in its report published today on ‘Airport expansion and climate and nature targets’.

The Committee’s inquiry examined whether the government can deliver airport expansion and meet the environmental goals that it has signed up for.

Currently, government policies are insufficient to deliver a reduction in carbon emissions from the aviation sector in line with carbon budgets. Alongside an increase in demand, this puts the government’s delivery of net zero in serious jeopardy.

“Whilst it may be possible for the government to deliver airport expansion alongside its climate and environment targets, we are concerned that the proposed environmental impact from airport expansion will make such targets significantly more difficult to achieve and at much greater effort and cost,” the Committee says.

“Furthermore, the government has not demonstrated that the economic growth from airport expansion provides enough benefit to outweigh the negative climate and environmental impacts it will lead to,” they add.

While expanding airport capacity is likely to provide some growth to the UK economy, MPs say the level of that growth is unclear and that the government has failed to provide substantial supporting evidence. Approving expansions already at Stansted, Luton and Gatwick suggests it is proceeding without the necessary evidence base to sufficiently underpin its economic arguments, the Committee says.

Ministers have ruled out measures to manage demand for aviation, such as limiting the number of fights available. MPs say that the government will need to demonstrate what alternative tools it will use instead, given that the Climate Change Committee cites demand management as one way to achieve environmental targets.

The Committee says the current Jet Zero Strategy relies on a far higher cost to industry to abate emissions than is currently seen and requires significant carbon savings to come from technology. These potentially carbon saving technologies, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) have not yet been seen on a commercial scale.

The Committee also raises its concern that ministers are proceeding with expansion before updating the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS), originally produced in 2018. By doing so, MPs warn the Government is relying on “an outdated policy framework which is inconsistent with its objectives” and not allowing for proper scrutiny of expansion proposals against the new ANPS.

The government must set out whether it will be able to deliver on its climate, environment and biodiversity targets while pursuing significant airport expansion, MPs say. It must do so before or alongside publishing an updated Airports National Policy Statement and before any further substantial expansion projects are underway.

Chair comment

Chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, Toby Perkins MP said:

“The aviation industry is critically important to the UK, but it’s also one of the hardest sectors of our economy to decarbonise. The government has made clear it is set on expanding airport capacity; the Committee has investigated how it can do that whilst meeting its own environmental targets.

Meeting our decarbonisation targets is already a major challenge. Expanding airport capacity is likely to make that task much harder. Under the government’s existing Jet Zero Strategy, expanding airport capacity is likely to put net zero at serious risk, unless it is accompanied by a serious strategic approach to increasing the pace of decarbonising aviation.

Having ruled out the kind of demand management measures likely to seriously reduce emissions, ministers need to make clear what alternative tools they are willing to use to ensure targets are met. New technological developments are promising and may in time provide an alternative route forward. But are they yet ready to be the basis for justifying this level of aviation expansion?

At the same time, the government is proposing to expand airport capacity because it will help to grow the economy. But Ministers were unable to point us to solid evidence setting out how much growth such expansion would deliver. If these plans are ever to get off the ground, it’s vital that the government provide us with some hard facts.

This problem can’t simply be outsourced to industry; the scale of the challenge is too great and only government has access to some of the tools needed. It’s time for the government to step up and take responsibility for its own targets. I’m concerned that the alternative is a lose-lose scenario that leaves a dynamic net zero economy out on the runway.”

Results of Operations:

Net income was $14.7 million, or $0.24 per average diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $6.4 million, or $0.10 for the second quarter of 2025, and $10.5 million, or $0.17 per average diluted common share for the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted net income (2) was $13.0 million, or $0.21 per average diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2025. The annualized return on average assets was 1.05%, the annualized return on average equity was 8.37%, and the annualized return on average tangible common equity (2) was 11.14% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 0.47%, 3.68%, and 4.89%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2025, and 0.78%, 6.14%, and 8.27%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024. The adjusted annualized return on average assets (2) was 0.95%, the adjusted annualized return on average equity (2) was 7.45%, and the adjusted annualized return on average tangible common equity (2) was 9.92%, for the second quarter of 2025.

Net income was $32.7 million, or $0.53 per average diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2025. Adjusted net income (2) was $39.3 million, or $0.64 per average diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2025, compared to $29.9 million, or $0.49 per average diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2024. EPS increased 8% and adjusted EPS (2) increased 31% for the first nine months of 2025, compared to the first nine months of 2024. The annualized return on average assets was 0.79%, the annualized return on average equity was 6.29%, and the annualized return on average tangible common equity (2) was 8.38% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 0.76%, 5.91%, and 7.98%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The adjusted annualized return on average assets (2) was 0.95%, the adjusted annualized return on average equity (2) was 7.55%, and the adjusted annualized return on average tangible common equity (2) was 10.06%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.

Total revenue, which is defined as net interest income before provision for credit losses on loans plus noninterest income, increased $2.2 million, or 5%, to $50.0 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $47.8 million for the second quarter of 2025, and increased $7.9 million, or 19%, from $42.2 million for the third quarter of 2024. Total revenue increased $17.8 million, or 14%, to $143.8 million for the first nine months of 2025, compared to $126.0 million for the first nine months of 2024.

Net interest income totaled $46.8 million for the third quarter of 2025, representing an increase of $2.0 million, or 4%, compared to $44.8 million for the second quarter of 2025. The FTE net interest margin (2) was 3.60% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 3.54% for the second quarter of 2025. The increase in the net interest margin is primarily attributable to higher average balances of loans and overnight funds, a higher average yield on securities, and a decrease in the average cost of deposits. The cost of deposits was down 4 basis points, driven by proactive management of exception based deposit pricing and favorable noninterest-bearing deposit mix shift. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in the average balances of securities due to maturities and paydowns.

Net interest income increased $7.5 million, or 19%, to $46.8 million, compared to $39.3 million for the third quarter of 2024. The FTE net interest margin (2) increased from 3.15% for the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower rates paid on customer deposits, an increase in the average yields on loans and securities, a higher average balance of loans, and an increase in the average balance of deposits resulting in a higher average balance of overnight funds, partially offset by a lower average yield on overnight funds.

For the first nine months of 2025, net interest income increased $17.3 million, or 15% to $135.0 million, compared to $117.7 million for the first nine months of 2024. The FTE net interest margin (2) increased 28 basis points to 3.51% for the first nine months of 2025, from 3.23% for the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to decrease in rates paid on client deposits, an increase in the average balances of average interest earning assets, and an increase in the average yields on loans and securities, partially offset by a lower yield on overnight funds.

Total noninterest income increased 8% to $3.2 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $3.0 million for the second quarter of 2025, and increased 14% from $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2024. Total noninterest income increased 7% to $8.9 million for the first nine months of 2025, compared to $8.3 million for the first nine months of 2024. The increase in noninterest income for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 was primarily driven by a $386,000 recovery on an acquired loan that had been previously charged off and by higher facility fees. For the first nine months of 2025, the increase was partially offset by a $219,000 gain on proceeds from company-owned life insurance recorded in the same period of 2024.

(2) This is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined and discussed under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in this press release.

Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2025 totaled $29.0 million, compared to $38.3 million (3) for the second quarter of 2025, and $27.6 million for the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted noninterest expense (4) was $29.1 million for the second quarter of 2025. Noninterest expense totaled $96.8 million (3) for the first nine months of 2025, compared to $83.3 million for the first nine months of 2024. Adjusted noninterest expense (4) for the first nine months of 2025 increased to $87.6 million, compared to $83.3 million for the first nine months of 2024. The increase in adjusted noninterest expense ( 4) for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the respective periods in 2024 was primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits as a result of annual salary increases. The first nine months of 2025 was also impacted by higher professional fees and information technology related expenses as the Company invested in enhancing its infrastructure.

For the third quarter the Company’s PPNR, which is defined as total revenue less adjusted noninterest expense was $21.0 million, compared to $9.4 million for the second quarter of 2025, and $14.6 million for the third quarter of 2024. For the third quarter the Company’s adjusted PPNR (4) increased 13% to $21.0 million from $18.6 million for the second quarter of 2025, and increased 44% from $14.6 million for the third quarter of 2024. For the first nine months of 2025, the Company’s PPNR was $47.0 million, compared to $42.7 million for the first nine months of 2024. For the first nine months of 2025, the Company’s adjusted PPNR (4) increased 31% to $56.2 million from $42.7 million for the first nine months of 2024.

The provision for credit losses on loans totaled $416,000 for the third quarter of 2025, compared to a $516,000 provision for credit losses on loans for the second quarter of 2025 and a provision for credit losses on loans of $153,000 for the third quarter of 2024. Net recoveries totaled $378,000 for the third quarter of 2025, compared to net charge-offs of $145,000 for the second quarter of 2025, and net charge-offs of $288,000 for the third quarter of 2024.

The provision for credit losses on loans totaled $1.2 million for the first nine months of 2025, compared to a $808,000 provision for credit losses on loans for the first nine months of 2024. Net charge-offs totaled $732,000 for the first nine months of 2025, compared to $947,000 for the first nine months of 2024.

Income tax expense increased to $5.9 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $2.5 million for the second quarter of 2025, and $3.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher pre-tax income. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 was 28.5% for both the third and second quarters of 2025, and 27.3% for the third quarter of 2024.

Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $13.1 million, compared to $12.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The effective tax rate for nine months ended September 30, 2025 was 28.6%, compared to 28.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The efficiency ratio was 58.05% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 80.23% for the second quarter of 2025, and 65.37% for the third quarter of 2024. The adjusted efficiency ratio (4) improved to 58.05% for the third quarter of 2025, from 61.01% for the second quarter of 2025, and 65.37% for the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher total revenue. The reported efficiency ratio was 67.31% for the first nine months of 2025. The adjusted efficiency ratio (4) improved to 60.92% for the first nine months of 2025 from 66.08% for the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to higher total revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.

Full time equivalent employees were 350 at both September 30, 2025 and June 30, 2025, and 353 at September 30, 2024.

(3) During the second quarter of 2025, the Company recorded expenses of $9.2 million, primarily due to pre-tax charges related to the settlement of certain litigation matters, including the anticipated settlement of a previously disclosed class action and California Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) lawsuit that alleged the violation of certain California wage-and-hour and related laws and regulations, and charges related to the planned closure of a Bank branch.

(4) This is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined and discussed under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in this press release.

Balance Sheet, Liquidity and Capital Management:

Total assets increased 3% to $5.6 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to $5.5 billion at June 30, 2025, primarily due to an increase in deposits resulting in an increase in overnight funds, purchases of investment securities, and an increase in loans. Total assets were relatively flat from $5.6 billion at September 30, 2024.

Investment securities available-for-sale (at fair value) increased to $408.5 million at September 30, 2025, compared to $307.0 million at June 30, 2025, primarily due to purchases, partially offset by maturities and paydowns. At September 30, 2024, these securities totaled $237.6 million. The pre-tax unrealized loss on the securities available-for-sale portfolio was $652,000, or $540,000 net of taxes, which equaled less than 1% of total shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2025.

During the first nine months of 2025, the Company purchased $174.2 million of agency mortgage-backed securities, $129.8 million of collateralized mortgage obligations, and $44.8 million of U.S. Treasury securities, for total purchases of $348.8 million in the available-for-sale portfolio. Securities purchased had a book yield of 4.92% and an average life of 5.42 years.

Investment securities held-to-maturity (at amortized cost, net of an $11,000 allowance for credit losses), totaled $544.8 million at September 30, 2025, compared to $561.2 million at June 30, 2025, and $604.2 million at September 30, 2024. The fair value of the securities held-to-maturity portfolio was $476.8 million at September 30, 2025. The pre-tax unrecognized loss on the securities held-to-maturity portfolio was $68.0 million, or $47.9 million net of taxes, which equaled 7% of total shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2025.

The unrealized and unrecognized losses in both the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios resulted from higher interest rates at September 30, 2025, compared to when the securities were purchased. The issuers are of high credit quality, and all principal amounts are expected to be repaid at maturity. Fair values are expected to recover as the securities approach maturity and/or if market rates decline.

Loans HFI, net of deferred costs and fees, increased $47.3 million, or 1% to $3.6 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to $3.5 billion at June 30, 2025, and increased $171.4 million, or 5%, from $3.4 billion at September 30, 2024. Loans HFI, excluding residential mortgages, increased $58.6 million, or 2% to $3.14 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to $3.08 billion at June 30 2025, and increased $207.8 million, or 7%, from $2.93 billion at September 30, 2024.

Commercial and industrial line utilization was 35% at September 30, 2025, compared to 32% at June 30, 2025, and 31% at September 30, 2024. Commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans totaled $2.0 billion at September 30, 2025, of which 31% were owner occupied and 69% were investor CRE loans. Owner occupied CRE loans also totaled 31% at both June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024. Approximately 23% of the Company’s loan portfolio consisted of floating interest rate loans at September 30, 2025, compared to 24% at June 30, 2025, and 25% at September 30, 2024.

At September 30, 2025, paydowns and maturities of investment securities and fixed interest rate loans maturing within one year totaled $343.8 million.

Total deposits increased $149.2 million, or 3%, to $4.8 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to $4.6 billion at June 30, 2025, and increased $47.0 million, or 1% from $4.7 billion at September 30, 2024.

The following table shows the Company’s deposit types as a percentage of total deposits at the dates indicated:

September 30, June 30, September 30, DEPOSITS TYPE % TO TOTAL DEPOSITS 2025 2025 2024 Demand, noninterest-bearing 26 % 25 % 27 % Demand, interest-bearing 19 % 21 % 19 % Savings and money market 28 % 28 % 28 % Time deposits — under $250 1 % 1 % 1 % Time deposits — $250 and over 5 % 4 % 4 % Insured Cash Sweep (""ICS"")/Certificate of Deposit Registry Service (""CDARS"") - interest-bearing demand, money market and time deposits 21 % 21 % 21 % Total deposits 100 % 100 % 100 %

The loan to deposit ratio was 74.99% at September 30, 2025, compared to 76.38% at June 30, 2025, and 72.11% at September 30, 2024.

The Company’s total available liquidity and borrowing capacity was $3.3 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to $3.1 billion at June 30, 2025, and $3.2 billion at September 30, 2024.

Total shareholders’ equity was $700.0 million at September 30, 2025, compared to $694.7 million at June 30, 2025, and $685.4 million at September 30, 2024.

Total accumulated other comprehensive loss of $5.2 million at September 30, 2025 was comprised of $2.5 million in actuarial losses associated with split dollar insurance contracts, $2.1 million in actuarial losses associated with the supplemental executive retirement plan, unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale of $540,000, and a $40,000 unrealized gain on interest-only strip from SBA loans.

Capital at September 30, 2025 was above well capitalized regulatory thresholds.

The reported tangible book value per share (5) was $8.61 at September 30, 2025, compared to $8.49 at June 30, 2025, and $8.33 at September 30, 2024. The adjusted tangible book value per share (5) was $8.71, compared to $8.59 at June 30, 2025, and $8.33 at September 30, 2024.

Asset Quality:

The allowance for credit losses on loans (“ACLL”) at September 30, 2025 was $49.4 million, or 1.38% of total loans. The ACLL at June 30, 2025 was $48.6 million, or 1.38% of total loans. The ACLL at September 30, 2024 was $47.8 million, or 1.40% of total loans. The increase in the ACLL year-over-year is due to loan growth.

NPAs were $3.7 million at September 30, 2025, compared to $6.2 million at June 30, 2025, and $7.2 million at September 30, 2024. There were no Shared National Credits (“SNCs”) in NPAs or total loans at September 30, 2025, June 30, 2025, or September 30, 2024.

Classified assets totaled $34.6 million, or 0.62% of total assets, at September 30, 2025, compared to $37.5 million, or 0.69% of total assets, at June 30, 2025, and $32.6 million, or 0.59% of total assets, at September 30, 2024.

Announcing An Increase to the Company's Share Repurchase Program:

Today, the Board of Directors (the ""Board"") of the Company approved an increase in the maximum total value of shares authorized for repurchase under the Company’s share repurchase program, initially approved by the Board in July 2024 (the “Repurchase Program”), doubling the authorization from $15 million to $30 million. The term of the Repurchase Program was also extended by the Board to October 31, 2026. During the second and third quarters of 2025, the Company repurchased 439,187 shares of its common stock with a weighted average price of $9.22 per share for a total of $4.0 million. The remaining capacity under the Program after giving effect to the amendment as described above is $26 million at September 30, 2025.

Reclassifications

During the first quarter of 2025, we reclassified Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) stock dividends from interest income to noninterest income and the related average asset balances were reclassified from interest earning assets to other assets on the “Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin” tables. The amounts for the prior periods were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. These reclassifications did not affect previously reported net income or shareholders’ equity.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Financial results are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company’s performance. These measures include “adjusted” operating metrics that have been adjusted to exclude notable expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2025 as well as other performance measures and ratios adjusted for notable items. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance comparability between periods and in some instances are common in the banking industry. These non-GAAP financial measures should be supplemental to primary GAAP financial measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for primary GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is presented in the tables at the end of this press release under “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

Forward-Looking Statement Disclaimer

Such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain in that they reflect plans and expectations for future events. These statements may include, among other things, those relating to the Company’s future financial performance, plans and objectives regarding future events, expectations regarding changes in interest rates and market conditions, projected cash flows of our investment securities portfolio, the performance of our loan portfolio, loan growth, expenses, net interest margin, estimated net interest income resulting from a shift in interest rates, expectation of high credit quality issuers ability to repay, as well as statements relating to the anticipated effects on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations from expected developments or events. Any statements that reflect our belief about, confidence in, or expectations for future events, performance or condition should be considered forward-looking statements. Readers should not construe these statements as assurances of a given level of performance, nor as promises that we will take actions that we currently expect to take. All statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control and some of which may fall outside our ability to predict or anticipate. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from our projected results, and we may take actions or experience events that we do not currently expect. Risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial performance to differ materially from our goals, plans, expectations and projections expressed in forward-looking statements include those set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Item 1A of the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31,2025, and include: (i) cybersecurity risks that may affect us directly or may impact us indirectly by virtue of their effects on our clients, markets or vendors, including our ability to identify and address cybersecurity risks, including those posed by the increasing use of artificial intelligence (such as, but not limited to, ransomware, data security breaches, “denial of service” attacks, “hacking” and identity theft) affecting us, our clients, and our third-party vendors and service providers; (ii) events that affect our ability to attract, recruit, and retain qualified officers and other personnel to implement our strategic plan, and that enable current and future personnel to protect and develop our relationships with clients, and to promote our business, results of operations and growth prospects; (iii) media items and consumer confidence as those factors affect our clients’ confidence in the banking system generally and in our bank specifically; (iv) adequacy of our risk management framework, disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (v) market, geographic and sociopolitical factors that arise by virtue of the fact that we operate primarily in the general San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California; (vi) risks of geographic concentration of our client base, our loans, and the collateral securing our loans, as those clients and assets may be particularly subject to natural disasters and to events and conditions that directly or indirectly affect those regions, including the particular risks of natural disasters (including earthquakes, fires, and flooding) and other events that disproportionately affect that region; (vii) political events that have accompanied or that may in the future accompany or result from recent political changes, particularly including the imposition of tariffs, sociopolitical events and conditions that result from political conflicts and law enforcement activities that may adversely affect our markets or our clients; (viii) our ability to estimate accurately, and to establish adequate reserves against, the risk of loss associated with our loan and lease portfolios and our factoring business; (ix) inflationary pressures and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, the fair value of financial instruments or our level of loan originations, or increase the level of defaults, losses and prepayments on loans to clients, whether held in the portfolio or in the secondary market; (x) factors that affect the value and liquidity of our investment portfolios, particularly the values of securities available-for-sale; (xi) factors that affect our liquidity and our ability to meet client demands for withdrawals from deposit accounts and undrawn lines of credit, including our cash on hand and the availability of funds from our own lines of credit; (xii) increased capital requirements for our continual growth or as imposed by banking regulators, which may require us to raise capital at a time when capital is not available on favorable terms or at all; (xiii) the expense and uncertain resolution of litigation matters whether occurring in the ordinary course of business or otherwise, particularly including but not limited to the effects of recent and ongoing developments in California labor and employment laws, regulations and court decisions; (xiv) operational issues stemming from, and/or capital spending necessitated by, the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology systems, on which we are highly dependent; and (xv) our success in managing the risks involved in the foregoing factors.

Strong credit quality – Nonperforming assets to total assets were 0.01%

AUBURN, Ala., Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Auburn National Bancorporation, Inc. (Nasdaq: AUBN) reported net earnings of $2.2 million, or $0.64 per share, for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $1.8 million, or $0.52 per share, for the second quarter of 2025, and $1.7 million, or $0.50 per share, for the third quarter of 2024. Net earnings were $5.6 million, or $1.60 per share, for the first nine months of 2025, compared to $4.8 million, or $1.38 per share, for the first nine months of 2024.

“Our third quarter results reflect strong credit quality and continued improvement in our net interest margin,” said David A. Hedges, President and CEO. “Also, we are pleased to report progress on our digital initiatives as we recently rolled out online account opening for certain deposit products. We believe this is an important step in enhancing convenience and expanding access to our banking services,” continued Mr. Hedges.

Net interest income (tax-equivalent) was $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $7.4 million in the second quarter of 2025, and $6.8 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase was due to growth in average interest-earning assets and improvements in our net interest margin.

Net interest margin (tax-equivalent) was 3.30% in the third quarter of 2025, compared to 3.27% in the second quarter of 2025, and 3.05% in the third quarter of 2024. The increase compared to the second quarter of 2025 was primarily due to improved yields on interest-earning assets. The increase compared to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to improved yields on interest-earning assets, and a decrease in our cost of interest-bearing deposits.

Nonperforming assets were $0.1 million, or 0.01% of total assets, at September 30, 2025, compared to $0.3 million, or 0.03% at June 30, 2025, and $0.8 million, or 0.08% of total assets, at September 30, 2024.

The Company recorded a negative provision for credit losses of $255 thousand in the third quarter of 2025, compared to a charge to provision for credit losses of $113 thousand in the second quarter of 2025 and a negative provision for credit losses of $127 thousand in the third quarter of 2024. The provision for credit losses is affected by organic loan growth in our loan portfolio, our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio, our expectations about future economic conditions and net charge-offs.

At September 30, 2025, the Company’s allowance for credit losses was $6.7 million, or 1.20% of total loans, compared to $7.0 million, or 1.24% of total loans, at June 30, 2025, and $6.9 million, or 1.22% of total loans, at September 30, 2024.

Noninterest income was $0.8 million for the third quarter of 2025, unchanged from the second quarter of 2025, and the third quarter of 2024.

Noninterest expense was $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $5.7 million for the second quarter of 2025, and $5.5 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase from the second quarter of 2025 was primarily related to increases in salaries and benefits expense. The increase compared to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits expense and other noninterest expense.

The provision for income tax expense was $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $0.5 million for both the second quarter of 2025, and the third quarter of 2024.

The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 was 21.86%, compared to 20.92% for the second quarter of 2025 and 23.46% for the third quarter of 2024. The Company’s effective income tax rate is principally affected by tax-exempt earnings from the Company’s investments in municipal securities and loans, bank-owned life insurance, and New Markets Tax Credits.

Total assets were $1.0 billion at September 30, 2025 and June 30, 2025 and $990.1 million at September 30, 2024. Loans, net of unearned income were $557.9 million at September 30, 2025, compared to $562.7 million at June 30, 2025 and $565.7 million at September 30, 2024. Total deposits were $917.3 million at September 30, 2025, compared to $939.9 million at June 30, 2025, and $901.7 million at September 30, 2024. The decrease in deposits compared to June 30, 2025 was primarily due to fluctuations in reciprocal customer deposits sold through Intrafi network. At September 30, 2025 the Company had $33.0 million reciprocal deposits sold, compared to none at June 30, 2025 and $37.8 million at September 30, 2024. The increase in deposits compared to September 30, 2024 was primarily related to growth in interest-bearing deposits of $19.0 million, which was partially offset by a decrease of $3.5 million in noninterest-bearing deposits. The Company had no FHLB advances or other wholesale funding outstanding at September 30, 2025, June 30, 2025, or September 30, 2024.

At September 30, 2025, the Company's consolidated stockholders' equity (book value) was $89.6 million or $25.65 per share, compared to $86.1 million, or $24.64 per share, at June 30, 2025, and $84.3 million, or $24.14 per share, at September 30, 2024. The increase from June 30, 2025 was primarily driven by net earnings of $2.2 million and other comprehensive income of $2.2 million due to a decrease in unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale, net of tax. These increases in stockholders’ equity were partially offset by cash dividends paid of $0.9 million.

All of the Company’s marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale. Therefore, any changes in the fair value of the Company’s securities portfolio are reflected in total equity, net of tax, under generally accepted accounting principles. Unrealized losses on our securities portfolio vary with market interest rates and do not affect our capital for regulatory capital purposes.

The Company’s tangible common equity (“TCE”) ratio or total equity to total assets ratio was 8.86% at September 30, 2025, compared to 8.36% at June 30, 2025, and 8.52% at September 30, 2024.

The Company paid cash dividends of $0.27 per share in the third quarter of 2025. At September 30, 2025, the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were well above the minimum amounts required to be “well capitalized” under current regulatory standards.

Explanation of Certain Unaudited Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The attached financial highlights include certain designated net interest income amounts presented on a tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP financial measure, and the presentation and calculation of the efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP measure. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance and believes the presentation of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis provides comparability of net interest income from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and facilitates comparability within the industry. Similarly, the efficiency ratio is a common measure that facilitates comparability with other financial institutions. Although the Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors’ understanding of its business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. Along with the attached financial highlights, the Company provides reconciliations between the GAAP financial measures and these non-GAAP financial measures.

Shreveport, La, Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. of Louisiana (the “Company”) (Nasdaq: HFBL), the holding company of Home Federal Bank, reported net income for the three months ended September 30, 2025, of $1.599 million compared to net income of $941,000 reported for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company’s basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.53 and $0.52, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $0.31 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The Company reported the following highlights during the three months ended September 30, 2025:

■ Book value per share increased to $18.46 at September 30, 2025 from $17.90 at June 30, 2025.

■ $1.242 million reduction in losses on held-to-maturity securities since June 30, 2025, which equates to $0.40 per share.

■ Zero dependency on wholesale funding – no brokered deposits or FHLB advances at September 30, 2025 or June 30, 2025.

■ 65 basis point increase to net interest margin compared to the same period in 2024.

The increase in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, resulted from an increase of $834,000, or 18.8%, in net interest income, an increase of $350,000, or 116.7%, in non-interest income, a decrease of $160,000, or 4.0%, in non-interest expense, partially offset by an increase of $420,000 in the provision for income taxes, and an increase of $266,000, or 119.3%, in the provision for credit losses. The increase in net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, resulted from a decrease of $565,000, or 17.0%, in total interest expense and an increase of $269,000, or 3.5%, in total interest income. The Company’s average interest rate spread was 2.99% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 2.23% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company’s net interest margin was 3.63% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 2.98% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to a $223,000 recovery for the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from a decrease in net loans receivable during the period.

The following table sets forth the Company’s average balances and average yields earned and rates paid on its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated.

The $350,000 increase in non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the prior year quarterly period, resulted from a decrease of $254,000 in loss on sale of real estate, an increase of $50,000 in gain on sale of loans, an increase of $32,000 in service charges on deposit accounts, and an increase of $14,000 in other non-interest income. The $254,000 loss on sale of real estate for the prior year period related to a one-to-four family residence in other real estate owned that was sold during the period.

The $160,000 decrease in non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, resulted from decreases of $152,000 in compensation and benefits expense, $63,000 in audit and examination fees, $33,000 in franchise and bank shares tax, $32,000 in professional fees, $28,000 in advertising expense, $7,000 in amortization of core deposit intangible expense, partially offset by increases of $117,000 in data processing expense, $17,000 in other non-interest expense, $14,000 in loan and collection expense, $4,000 in occupancy and equipment expense, and $3,000 in deposit insurance premium expense. The increase in data processing expense resulted from a billing discrepancy with our core processor, which had failed to issue invoices for certain services dating back to December 2022. Upon discovery of the issue, we negotiated a discounted settlement to resolve the outstanding invoices, and all invoices going forward included all services. The increase in services billed resulted in the increase for the three months ended September 30, 2025.

Neste and United Airlines have expanded their existing partnership to supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to three new major airports in the United States. The new agreement makes United the first commercial airline to purchase SAF for use on flights from George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in New Jersey, and Dulles International Airport (IAD) in Washington D.C.

As part of the agreement, Neste will supply neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ to United Airlines. The sustainable aviation fuel will be blended with conventional jet fuel before use to meet jet fuel specifications.

Neste began the SAF deliveries to United at George Bush Airport in July and they will continue until the end of October 2025. Deliveries of SAF to Newark Airport and Dulles Airport started in September 2025 and are set to continue until the end of 2025. The fuel is delivered to each airport via existing pipeline infrastructure from Neste’s SAF terminal facilities in Houston.

“Introducing sustainable aviation fuel for the first time at our hubs in Houston, Newark, and Dulles is another significant milestone in United’s sustainability journey,” said United Chief Sustainability Officer Lauren Riley. “While United remains the leading SAF user in the U.S., using over 4,300 metric tons (13 million gallons) last year, we recognize that the growth of the SAF market requires support from both state and federal governments. We will continue collaborating with stakeholders, like Neste, across the aviation value chain to encourage policymakers to implement sensible market incentives that promote lower-carbon energy.”

“We are thrilled to enable United Airlines to expand SAF use to new markets in the United States. It is crucial that more states enact proven incentive policy frameworks to accelerate the production of SAF and support the aviation industry towards its bold net-zero carbon emission goal by 2050. We remain fully committed to supporting our customers in reducing emissions by scaling our SAF production and supply capabilities,” says Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste.

This new agreement builds on the long-term partnership between Neste and United. Neste has been supplying SAF to United at Chicago O’Hare International Airport since August 2024, after the SAF purchase credit was enacted in Illinois, making United the first airline to use SAF at the airport. Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel has also been used by the airline at San Francisco International Airport in California, where the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) is supporting the use of renewable fuels.

Sustainable aviation fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel is a renewable aviation fuel that provides an alternative to conventional, fossil-based jet fuel. With the use of neat (i.e. unblended) Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be reduced by up to 80%* over the fuel’s life cycle compared to using conventional jet fuel. Neste’s SAF is made from 100% renewable raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. SAF is certified for commercial use and can currently be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel and works seamlessly with existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure. Today, Neste’s global SAF production capability is 1.5 million tons (around 515 million gallons) per annum, and it is set to grow to 2.2 million tons (around 750 million gallons) in 2027.

In this scenario, sustainable fuels meet 10% of road transport demand, 15% of aviation fuel needs and 35% of shipping fuel requirements.
Cost gap remains Despite the positive outlook, costs remain a barrier, with sustainable fuel options remaining far more expensive than fossil equivalents.","The International Energy Agency (IEA) released a wide-ranging report this week assessing the state of sustainable fuels and forecasting sharp growth across all major sectors – but only if current and planned policies are fully implemented.

The IEA’s projections indicate that global consumption of liquid and gaseous sustainable fuels could quadruple by 2035, shaping long-term procurement strategies for transport, power and heavy industry.

The report, issued in support of COP30, evaluates how the world can step up production and deployment of fuels such as biofuels, biogas and hydrogen-based alternatives. It sets out potential pathways, highlights cost hurdles and outlines how targeted public procurement and investment could support broader decarbonisation targets.

Consumption outlook and market share projections

Sustainable fuels currently account for 1.3% of global energy consumption. Of that, liquid biofuels comprise nearly 80%, helping cut oil demand by around 2.5 million barrels per day.

In addition, these fuels help countries reduce their reliance on imported transport fuels by 5–15%, depending on local market conditions.

The IEA notes that “between 2010 and 2024, global demand for sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels doubled,” but adds that current trends still fall short of what is needed to reach international climate goals.

Under its “accelerated case” scenario, the IEA models a future where all planned policies become fully legislated, market barriers are lifted and production capacity expands. In this outlook, global sustainable fuel use rises to 13 exajoules by 2030 and reaches 28 exajoules by 2035. An exajoule equals one quintillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) joules, a standard unit for measuring large-scale energy consumption.

Transport remains the largest consumer, making up 50% of global sustainable fuel use in 2035. In this scenario, sustainable fuels meet 10% of road transport demand, 15% of aviation fuel needs and 35% of shipping fuel requirements.

To help realise this trajectory, the IEA lists six policy recommendations for governments, including:

Clear national roadmaps

Strong and enforceable mandates

Demand predictability

Transparent carbon accounting

Public procurement

Long-term investment frameworks

The agency argues that “accelerating the deployment of sustainable fuels requires a mix of ambitious, stable and enforceable policies, such as mandates and performance standards, along with proactive public procurement"".

Private sector players echo the same call. Alice Henry, Co-Founder and CEO of UK-based RegenRate, says: “We need policy on our side. We need rules that reward farmers for doing the right thing and certification that’s fast, fair and rooted in reality.”

RegenRate works to boost biofuel feedstock capacity through sustainable agricultural methods.

Cost gap remains

Despite the positive outlook, costs remain a barrier, with sustainable fuel options remaining far more expensive than fossil equivalents.

For example, electrolytic hydrogen costs around 3.8 times more than traditional hydrogen. Electrolytic ammonia is 2.7 times as expensive, while biomethanol costs 3.7 times more than fossil-based fuels.

However, these higher costs are unlikely to cause major downstream price shocks for end-users, the IEA finds. This is due to low blending rates and energy costs forming only a small portion of final consumer prices.

A 15% blend of sustainable aviation fuel, for instance, would increase air ticket prices by 5–7%. Meanwhile, using low-emissions hydrogen in steelmaking would add less than 1% to the price of an electric vehicle.

The IEA warns that “policies that address only one dimension risk leaving critical gaps"". It calls for integrated frameworks that combine long-term demand signals with transitional support for emerging technologies, as well as international cooperation across borders and sectors.

Investment, employment and fuel diversity

Global investment in sustainable fuels grew 20% from 2023 to 2024, led by US and Brazilian policy support for biofuels, as well as the European Union’s REPowerEU Plan for biogas expansion.

If the accelerated case scenario unfolds, cumulative investment in sustainable fuel infrastructure, production and distribution will hit US$1.5tn by 2035. Direct employment twill triple to two million roles, with biofuels accounting for two-thirds of job growth.

The mix of sustainable fuels also continues to diversify. Liquid and gaseous biofuels hold a two-thirds market share in 2035. However, low-emissions hydrogen and its derivatives expand rapidly – from just 1% today to one-third of global consumption in the next decade.

That trajectory is drawing attention from across the energy sector.

Antonio Villaluenga, Vice President of US Project Development at Carbon Recycling International, says: “With US$1.5tn in sustainable fuel investments expected through 2035, and hydrogen-based fuels accounting for nearly half, renewable methanol is positioned as a vital solution for shipping, chemicals and beyond.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/20a60b309b2e6e25407d4ef95a2ac226:8ff0d98b8b27817b39e8695b1dc6c686/graphics-for-work-61.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 15:56:09.545348

“Projections based on announced investments show that SAF production in the EU is expected to reach the mandated SAF targets until 2034,” Itkonen said.
“the Commission also encourages SAF producers and airlines to produce and purchase SAF over and above the targets, respectively.
Several measures allow to bridge the price gap between SAF and conventional aviation fuel.
“In particular, transparency for airlines on the price of SAF and the establishment of a competitive liquid SAF market will be key to incentivise airlines to buy SAF above the targets,” Itkonen said.","EASA released its latest ReFuelEU Aviation Technical Report Wednesday, providing the first comprehensive review of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) activity across the European Union. Covering data from 2024, the report identifies Finland, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy as the leading producers, with commercial-scale output already underway.

Neste’s Porvoo refinery in Finland, TotalEnergies’ facilities at La Mède and Grandpuits in France, BP’s Lingen refinery in Germany, Repsol’s refineries in Spain, and Eni’s new 400 kt-per-year Gela biorefinery in Italy account for much of the EU’s current SAF supply.

Development across member states

Development continues across other Member States. Estonia and Latvia are conducting a joint EU-funded study on regional production potential, while Poland’s Orlen and Romania’s OMV are building their first large-scale plants. Ireland published its first national policy roadmap in August 2025, and Luxembourg’s Cargolux and Lux-Airport have secured offtake agreements with Norsk e-Fuel. Malta, Lithuania, and Slovenia currently report no domestic capacity.

The report establishes 2024 as the baseline year for monitoring progress toward ReFuelEU Aviation’s blending mandates. It notes that SAF represented about 0.6% of aviation fuel supplied in 2024 and that meeting the 2030 target of 6% is feasible under optimistic production scenarios.

Market shifts and policy response

Synthetic fuel projects remain behind schedule, with no facilities yet at final investment decision stage. EASA projects EU output could reach between 1.4 and 5.9 million tonnes by 2030, depending on buildout rates and investment progress.

Global investment remains an active issue. Since the close of the summer, for instance, a major airline partnership announced the launch of a $150 million investment fund for the fuel, while in Europe, Shell scrapped a project that would have produced one of the continent’s largest processing facilities, citing the need to balance affordability with customer demands.

European Commission confidence

Regarding the Shell plant closure last month, European Commission spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen told AVweb that the commission remains confident that the bloc will reach the EU’s mandated 2034 SAF targets.

“Projections based on announced investments show that SAF production in the EU is expected to reach the mandated SAF targets until 2034,” Itkonen said. “the Commission also encourages SAF producers and airlines to produce and purchase SAF over and above the targets, respectively. Several measures allow to bridge the price gap between SAF and conventional aviation fuel. The Sustainable Transport Investment Plan to be adopted in the Autumn will aim to further facilitate long-term SAF offtake agreements.”

Itkonen also said the Commission is keeping a close eye on the fuels market as it attempts to develop in accordance with ReFuelEU plans.

“In particular, transparency for airlines on the price of SAF and the establishment of a competitive liquid SAF market will be key to incentivise airlines to buy SAF above the targets,” Itkonen said.",https://avweb.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/sustainable-jet-fuel_tanker-truc.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 13:00:02.477566

Findings within the report state that the implementation of ReFuelEU Aviation has thus far stimulated increased SAF production within the EU, a trend that, according to the EASA, will see the EU on track to meet the overall mandatory SAF blending target of 6% in 2030.

The report has also confirmed that nearly all SAF used throughout 2024 was produced from used cooking oil (81%) and waste animal fats (17%), signalling that the development of synthetic fuels (eSAF) still remains within its initial stages in the EU.

The European Commission is now preparing a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), which is designed to boost investments in renewable and low-carbon transport fuels, including SAF.

Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, said:

The EU is making steady progress in adopting sustainable aviation fuels, and the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation is already helping to increase SAF production and use across Member States.

Our focus now is on supporting the industry and Member States to ensure a smooth and fair transition to cleaner aviation fuels.

The EASA’s next annual report will utilise data from 2025 to assess whether ReFuelEU’s first blending mandate, the obligation to supply at least 2% of total aviation fuel as SAF in EU airports, has been sufficiently met.

Under an agreement with Edgewood Renewables, Plug will use its hydrogen plant design experience to help build and integrate hydrogen into the SAF production process.

Specifically, the US green hydrogen firm will lead the engineering design, key product supply, fabrication, and project oversight.

Plug said the project “expands its reach beyond hydrogen into complementary clean fuel markets.”

Located at a former fuel-terminal site in Nevada, the plant will convert biomass into low-carbon fuels using thermochemical processes that integrate renewable natural gas and hydrogen.

Edgewood plans to produce over 120 million gallons of SAF per year. Construction of the facility and equipment is set to commence “in the coming months.”

The company emphasised the goal is to help decarbonise aviation, trucking, maritime, and other heavy transport sectors with the drop-in fuels.

The ISCC CORSIA certification ensures rigorous sustainability and traceability standards for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in international aviation markets. The certification process began after obtaining authorisation from the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels (ANP) for the production of SAF in May 2025, culminating in the issuance of the ISCC certificate in October. SAF can directly replace conventional jet fuel without requiring modifications to aircraft or fuelling infrastructure. This makes the fuel a practical and rapid solution for reducing emissions in the aviation sector.

Reduc has authorisation from the ANP to incorporate up to 1.2% renewable feedstock into its SAF production through this route. The refinery is expected to begin production in the coming months to sell up to 50 000 m³/month (10 000 bpd) of the fuel. The use of low-carbon feedstock and the renewable compound content of the fuel are compatible with the requirement for a 1% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for domestic aviation by 2027.

“Petrobras takes another step toward a just energy transition by offering the market a strategic, low-investment, fast-to-implement solution, effectively contributing to the decarbonisation of the aviation sector. At the same time, we are demonstrating the importance of investing in innovation and sustainability in Brazilian refining,” said William França, Petrobras’ Director of Industrial Processes and Products.

Bringing SAF production forward in line with current legislation, using the HEFA co-processing route, is crucial for the aviation market, given the sector’s future requirements. Starting in 2027, Brazilian airlines must begin using this type of fuel on international flights, based on the Future Fuel Law and the mandatory phase of CORSIA.

Why she matters: As United's chief sustainability officer, Riley has sought to position the airline — the first to publicly commit to a carbon-reduction target — as a leader on sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.

United used 13.6 million gallons of SAF in its mainline planes — larger, long-haul aircraft — last year, almost double the previous year's use. But those planes guzzled almost 4 billion gallons of conventional fuel, a shade above the 2023 level.

Driving the news: Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C. — along with Newark and Houston — are starting to use SAF, leaving Denver as the only United hub without it, the airline told Axios exclusively.

Neste Corp. began SAF deliveries to United in Houston in July and will continue until the end of October. Deliveries to Newark and Dulles started last month and are planned until the end of the year.

Riley hopes Denver will soon follow suit.

She recently chatted with Axios about her work. Her remarks have been condensed.

On the growing use of SAF at hubs: ""It's our demonstration that by using the existing fueling infrastructure, sustainable aviation fuel really can flow throughout the network, which is really exciting.""

""That means cost reductions because it's more efficient, right? It means it's less disruptive to the operation, and it means there's more opportunity to scale, frankly. ""

On increasing supply for SAF: ""I just took a tour of the Phillips 66 SAF refinery in Rodeo, right outside San Francisco. They primarily make renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels at that facility.""

""So we're seeing some of these traditional incumbents come online as well, in addition to those that have been early starters in the industry. It's beginning to diversify, which is exactly what we need to see.""

On what's needed for more growth: ""We need strong policy structures. The economics aren't there yet, but it's beginning to scale, and we're starting to see better economics than we've ever seen before ...

""[What we're] hearing loud and clear from our financial partners, our financial institutions that have the capital to put into this market, is that it's too risky right now, because the policy is not durable.""

On other emissions-reduction efforts: ""What's important to me is that every single aircraft we purchase is about 20% more fuel efficient than the aircraft it replaces.""

On air taxis: ""There's a lot of activity that's coming forward from this administration to provide the environments to begin testing different components of introducing [air taxis] into the airspace.""

""Of course, safety is everything. So doing this in sort of a measured and responsible manner is really important.""",https://images.axios.com/dymJ94Ll_LURBDMBOEESlz95AyQ=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/10/20/1760979689602.jpeg,N,,2025-10-23 08:56:10.762230

It has many other important recommendations too; it calls for the UK gov to: - Embrace the principle of geological net zero, meaning fossil emissions must be balanced by geological removals, not trees or soils. - Set up a GGR Strategy with clear national targets. - Create an Office for Greenhouse Gas Removals, giving CDR a permanent home in government. - Create UK standards for DACCS, BECCS, Biochar and ERW, and endorse existing standards in the meantime. - Set up new vehicles for innovation funding and R&D with additional support for pilot- and mid-scale projects to address “valley of death” issues and secure a pipeline of diverse GGR. The report is an official government-commissioned independent review, intended to influence policy so it carries a lot of weight.

Strategic Partnership Unveiled at IATA World Sustainability Symposium

The announcement was made in Hong Kong during the IATA World Sustainability Symposium, underscoring the mounting urgency for comprehensive cross-industry collaboration to decarbonize air travel. The partnership was formalized at a ceremony attended by Cathay Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer Alex McGowan and Airbus President for Asia-Pacific Anand Stanley, bringing together two industry giants with a shared vision for sustainable aviation.

This collaboration is particularly timely as the global aviation industry confronts increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), sustainable aviation fuels demonstrate the greatest potential to reduce CO2 emissions from international aviation, yet currently account for less than 1% of total aviation fuel consumption worldwide. The Airbus-Cathay partnership aims to directly address this supply constraint by targeting projects that can overcome the early-stage financing and infrastructure barriers that have historically constrained SAF market development.

Investment Framework and Project Selection Criteria

Under the terms of this strategic partnership, both companies will collaborate extensively to identify, evaluate, and invest in SAF production projects that demonstrate strong commercial viability, mature technology readiness, and credible pathways for long-term offtake agreements. The joint fund is specifically designed to support ventures that can bridge the gap between technological innovation and commercial scalability, with investments targeting projects across Asia and potentially extending to other global markets where conditions favor sustainable fuel development.

The selection process will prioritize initiatives that showcase not only technical feasibility but also economic sustainability. Projects will be assessed based on multiple criteria including feedstock availability, production technology maturity, regulatory compliance, environmental impact assessments, and the potential for establishing reliable supply chains. This rigorous evaluation framework ensures that investments channel toward ventures with the highest probability of delivering tangible emissions reductions while achieving commercial success.

“SAF remains the most important lever for Cathay and the wider aviation industry to drive toward our decarbonization goals,” said Alex McGowan, emphasizing the centrality of sustainable fuels to the company’s environmental strategy. “This co-investment partnership with Airbus strengthens our commitment to building a scalable SAF industry and complements our broader strategy of investing in technologies and production capacity for the future.”

Addressing the SAF Supply Challenge

The partnership emerges against a backdrop of acute SAF scarcity. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF production is expected to reach approximately 2 million tonnes in 2025, representing just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel requirements. This stark disparity between supply and demand highlights the monumental challenge facing the industry as it works toward achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, a target to which IATA member airlines committed in 2021.

The cost differential between SAF and conventional jet fuel remains a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Industry analyses indicate that SAF currently costs approximately five times more than regular jet fuel, driven by complex production processes, advanced technology requirements, and limited feedstock availability. The Airbus-Cathay investment aims to address these economic challenges by supporting projects that can achieve economies of scale and drive down production costs over time.

Both companies have emphasized that scaling SAF will require deep, system-wide coordination extending far beyond their bilateral partnership. Success depends on alignment among policymakers who establish regulatory frameworks, investors who provide capital, fuel producers who develop production capacity, and airlines that commit to long-term purchase agreements. The joint fund represents an attempt to catalyze this ecosystem by demonstrating manufacturer-airline collaboration on upstream investments.

Cathay Pacific’s Comprehensive Sustainability Portfolio

This latest investment complements Cathay Pacific’s existing sustainability initiatives, which demonstrate the airline’s multi-pronged approach to decarbonization. In September 2025, Cathay joined as a launch investor in the oneworld BEV SAF Fund, a collaborative initiative with other oneworld alliance airlines and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the climate investment firm founded by Bill Gates. That fund, which opened with $150 million in commitments, focuses specifically on novel, next-generation SAF technologies with breakthrough potential to scale significantly and reduce costs over the long term.

The distinction between these two investment vehicles is strategic and complementary. While the oneworld BEV Fund targets emerging technologies with transformative potential but longer development timelines, the Cathay-Airbus partnership announced today will concentrate on more mature SAF opportunities to accelerate near- to medium-term availability. This dual-track investment strategy allows Cathay to support both immediate production expansion and future technological breakthroughs, hedging against uncertainties while maintaining momentum toward decarbonization goals.

Cathay has also established agreements with multiple fuel producers to expand SAF availability at major operational hubs. These commercial arrangements provide the airline with access to available SAF supplies while supporting the business case for producers to expand capacity. By committing to purchase agreements, Cathay helps de-risk investments in new production facilities, demonstrating the critical role that airline offtake commitments play in catalyzing SAF market development.

Airbus’s Expanding Role in SAF Ecosystem Development

For Airbus, the partnership with Cathay represents a continuation and expansion of its strategic engagement across the SAF value chain. The aircraft manufacturer has made substantial commitments to ensure all of its aircraft are capable of operating with up to 100% SAF by 2030, a technical milestone that requires extensive testing, certification, and potential modifications to aircraft systems. This technical capability is essential for enabling airlines to significantly increase their SAF utilization as supply becomes available.

Beyond technical development, Airbus has established partnerships with fuel suppliers, governments, and other airlines worldwide to accelerate SAF market uptake. These collaborations address different aspects of the SAF ecosystem, from production and distribution to regulatory frameworks and certification standards. The manufacturer’s direct involvement in financing production projects represents a deeper level of engagement, effectively extending its business model upstream into fuel supply chain development.

“The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach,” said Anand Stanley, Airbus President for Asia-Pacific. “Our partnership with Cathay is a tangible step toward catalyzing production in regions best positioned for growth and feedstock supply.”

This statement underscores a critical strategic insight: SAF production will ultimately concentrate in regions with optimal combinations of feedstock availability, production infrastructure, regulatory support, and market access. Asia-Pacific, with its abundant biomass resources and rapidly growing aviation market, represents one such region with significant potential for SAF industry development.

Asia-Pacific’s Strategic Importance for SAF Development

The focus on Asia-Pacific reflects both opportunity and necessity. According to IATA projections, the Asia-Pacific aviation sector is poised to account for more than 40% of global passenger traffic by 2040, with passenger numbers projected to double by 2043. This explosive growth trajectory, driven by demographic expansion, rising middle-class incomes, and economic development in countries like China, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia, creates both tremendous environmental challenges and substantial market opportunities for SAF deployment.

The region possesses significant advantages for SAF production. Asia-Pacific countries have access to diverse feedstock sources including agricultural residues from rice and sugarcane production, used cooking oils from densely populated urban centers, and potential energy crops cultivated on marginal lands. These varied feedstock options provide flexibility and resilience in supply chains, reducing dependence on any single input source and enabling production facilities to optimize based on local resource availability and economic conditions.

However, the region currently faces significant challenges that the Airbus-Cathay partnership aims to help address. European regulations have established mandatory SAF blending requirements, with the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation setting minimum supply mandates starting at 2% in 2025 and increasing to 70% by 2050. While these policies drive demand in Europe, Asian countries have generally moved more slowly in establishing comparable regulatory frameworks, creating uncertainty for potential investors in production capacity.

The partnership between Airbus and Cathay includes explicit commitments to joint policy advocacy, leveraging their combined experience and networks to influence governments across the region. Their objectives include promoting supportive regulatory frameworks that reduce cost disparities between SAF and conventional jet fuel, facilitating development of regional production hubs, and ensuring consistent certification standards that enable SAF to move freely across international markets.

Economic and Environmental Imperatives

The economic case for SAF investment extends beyond environmental compliance. While current SAF production costs remain substantially higher than conventional jet fuel, industry experts anticipate significant cost reductions as production scales. The U.S. Department of Energy’s analysis suggests that expanded feedstock utilization, improved production technologies, and larger facility scales could progressively narrow the price gap, potentially achieving cost parity with fossil-based jet fuel in certain scenarios over the coming decades.

Government incentives are playing an increasingly important role in bridging the current cost gap. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act provides substantial tax credits for SAF production, with values determined by the carbon intensity reduction achieved compared to conventional fuel. These policy mechanisms help de-risk investments and accelerate the transition to commercial-scale production. Similar incentive structures are being developed or considered in various countries, creating a patchwork of support that influences where production capacity will ultimately be deployed.

The environmental imperative driving these investments cannot be overstated. Aviation accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, and while this may seem modest in absolute terms, the sector presents unique decarbonization challenges. Unlike ground transportation, which can increasingly electrify, long-haul aviation requires energy-dense liquid fuels for the foreseeable future. Hydrogen and electric propulsion may eventually serve short-haul routes, but SAF currently represents the only viable pathway to significantly reduce emissions from long-distance flights that dominate aviation’s environmental impact.

According to IATA estimates, SAF could contribute approximately 65% of the emissions reduction needed for aviation to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. This projection underscores why manufacturers like Airbus and airlines like Cathay are making substantial investments despite current economic challenges and uncertain policy environments.

Regulatory Framework and Carbon Offsetting Mechanisms

The Airbus-Cathay partnership operates within an evolving regulatory landscape designed to accelerate aviation decarbonization. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), established by ICAO, represents the first global market-based scheme applying to an entire sector. Under CORSIA, airlines must purchase carbon credits to offset emissions growth above established baselines, with the scheme transitioning from voluntary participation to mandatory compliance across most international routes by 2027.

CORSIA’s baseline was recently adjusted to 85% of 2019 emissions levels for the 2024-2035 period, representing a significantly more ambitious target than originally planned. This adjustment, which the industry supported, increases pressure on airlines to reduce emissions through both operational improvements and alternative fuels. Currently, 129 countries participate in CORSIA as of 2025, representing the vast majority of international aviation activity.

SAF plays a unique role within the CORSIA framework. Airlines can use CORSIA-eligible fuels to reduce their offsetting requirements, providing direct economic incentives for SAF adoption beyond the environmental benefits. This mechanism creates demand signals that help justify investments in production capacity, though the magnitude of this incentive depends on carbon credit prices and the cost differential between SAF and conventional fuel.

Long-Term Partnership and Fleet Relationship

The Airbus-Cathay collaboration builds on a relationship spanning more than three decades. Cathay took delivery of its first Airbus aircraft in 1989, and the airline now operates a fleet of 86 Airbus jets with over 70 additional aircraft on order. This substantial fleet commitment creates natural alignment around SAF development, as Cathay’s future operations will depend heavily on Airbus aircraft, and Airbus has clear interests in ensuring its customers can access sustainable fuels to meet regulatory requirements and corporate commitments.

The deepening of their relationship into joint investment in fuel infrastructure reflects a broader industry trend. Traditional boundaries between aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and fuel suppliers are blurring as companies recognize that long-term decarbonization depends on collaborative approaches that address the entire value chain. Similar partnerships are emerging globally, with various combinations of airlines, manufacturers, airports, and energy companies joining forces to accelerate SAF development.

Technology Pathways and Production Methods

The SAF industry employs multiple production pathways, each with distinct advantages, challenges, and feedstock requirements. Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology, which converts oils and fats into jet fuel, represents the most commercially mature pathway and accounts for the majority of current SAF production. However, HEFA faces feedstock constraints as global supplies of waste oils and fats are limited and face competing demands from other sectors.

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis can convert solid biomass or municipal solid waste into jet fuel, offering access to more abundant feedstock sources but requiring higher capital investment and more complex processing. Alcohol-to-jet pathways can utilize ethanol or other alcohols derived from various sources, providing another route to diversify feedstock options. Power-to-liquid technologies, which synthesize fuel from captured CO2 and renewable electricity, represent emerging approaches with tremendous potential but currently face significant cost and scale challenges.

The Airbus-Cathay investment will likely support projects across multiple pathways, reflecting the need for a diverse and resilient SAF supply chain. Different regions have varying feedstock advantages, and no single production technology will dominate globally. The partnership’s emphasis on commercial viability and technology maturity suggests a focus on pathways approaching or achieving commercial scale rather than early-stage research, though the precise project selection will depend on opportunities that emerge through their evaluation process.

Industry-Wide Implications and Future Outlook

For global aviation leaders and investors, the Airbus-Cathay partnership illustrates a fundamental shift in industry dynamics. Airlines and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are increasingly co-investing in upstream fuel infrastructure, recognizing that long-term decarbonization depends on securing scalable, cost-competitive SAF supply. This represents a departure from traditional industry structures where airlines purchased fuel from suppliers without involvement in production decisions or investments.

This trend toward vertical integration or strategic partnerships along the value chain is likely to accelerate as regulatory pressures intensify and airlines compete to secure reliable SAF supplies. First-mover advantages may accrue to companies that establish strong relationships with producers and secure favorable long-term offtake agreements, particularly as SAF supply growth lags behind regulatory mandates in many jurisdictions.

As governments worldwide prepare to enforce stricter carbon-reduction targets under ICAO’s CORSIA framework and national net-zero policies, collaborations like the Airbus-Cathay partnership will play critical roles in bridging the gap between technological readiness and commercial deployment. The success or failure of these investments will significantly influence whether aviation can meet its ambitious climate commitments while continuing to provide essential connectivity that supports global economic growth and social development.

The $70 million investment, while substantial, represents just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Industry analyses suggest that achieving meaningful SAF penetration will require hundreds of billions of dollars in investment across production facilities, distribution infrastructure, and feedstock supply chains over the coming decades. The Airbus-Cathay partnership serves as both a practical investment vehicle and a demonstration of the collaborative approaches that will be necessary to mobilize capital at the required scale.

Conclusion: A Decisive Step Toward Sustainable Aviation

The announcement of the Airbus-Cathay Pacific $70 million co-investment partnership marks a decisive step in reshaping the global aviation fuel landscape. By committing substantial resources to accelerate SAF production, particularly in the strategically important Asia-Pacific region, these industry leaders are not merely responding to regulatory pressures but actively shaping the infrastructure and markets that will define aviation’s sustainable future.

The partnership’s success will depend on numerous factors beyond the companies’ direct control, including government policy decisions, technological breakthroughs, feedstock availability, and broader economic conditions. However, by taking concrete action to invest in production capacity, advocate for supportive policies, and demonstrate the viability of manufacturer-airline collaboration on fuel infrastructure, Airbus and Cathay are helping to de-risk the SAF industry and create pathways for others to follow.

As the aviation industry confronts the dual imperatives of continued growth and radical emissions reduction, initiatives like this partnership provide tangible evidence that stakeholders recognize the magnitude of the challenge and are willing to commit resources toward solutions. Whether this $70 million investment proves catalytic in accelerating Asia-Pacific’s SAF industry development remains to be seen, but it undeniably represents a significant commitment from two major players whose long-term success depends on achieving sustainable aviation at scale.

The report provides a comprehensive overview of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) uptake across the EU in 2024 and assesses the market's readiness to meet upcoming obligations under the Regulation.

According to the findings, implementation of ReFuelEU Aviation has already stimulated increased SAF production capacity within the EU. This positive trend confirms that the EU is on track to meet the overall mandatory SAF blending target in 2030, which is 6 percent.

The report confirms that almost all SAF used in 2024 was bio fuel, produced from used cooking oil and waste animal fats. This shows that the development of synthetic fuels remains in its early stages in the EU. The SAF market also remains concentrated: 25 fuel suppliers provided SAF to 33 EU airports across 12 Member States. However, airports in five Member States - France, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden - accounted for 99% of supply.

The European Commission said it is currently preparing a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, designed to boost investments in renewable and low-carbon transport fuels, including SAF.

European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas said: ""The EU is making steady progress in adopting sustainable aviation fuels, and the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation is already helping to increase SAF production and use across Member States. Our focus now is on supporting the industry and Member States to ensure a smooth and fair transition to cleaner aviation fuels.""

For the next annual report, the data from 2025 will be used to assess whether ReFuelEU's first blending mandate, the obligation to supply at least 2 percent of total aviation fuel as SAF in EU airports, has been met.

Another veg box delivery company had converted their vans to biodiesel and I wondered if we should be doing the same. After less than a week he came back with a firm ‘no’: “biodiesel seldom delivered a net carbon benefit and often contributed to deforestation and biodiversity loss by driving the market for palm oil”. We decided to focus on electric vans instead – 20 years later, 68% of our vans are electric, held back by vehicle range, availability, and gaps in the charging network.

Earlier this month, the respected think tank, Transport and Environment, released a study arguing that biofuels add significantly to world emissions because they cause ‘indirect land clearance and deforestation’ (transportenvironment.org/ articles). The situation is set to get even worse with plans to introduce “Sustainable Aviation Fuel” (SAF) – made from biomass or waste (including used cooking oil) and intended to replace fossil fuel-based kerosene. The problem? SAF represents less than 0.05% of total EU aviation fuel use; the 99%+ shortfall comes from the corrupt trade in virgin palm oil, leading to further rainforest destruction.

Two decades after doing our research, 30% of maize grown in the UK (and 40% in the US) will still be used to make biofuel or to generate electricity in AD (anaerobic digestion) plants that we’re all subsidising at the pump, through our energy bills and taxes. Even madder – a significant part of the UK crop is grown on the fens where ploughing releases huge amounts of CO2 from the oxidising peat, resulting in emissions that are three times higher than burning oil. Why are we subsidising biofuels that, far from fighting climate change, are contributing to it?

I’m all for green legislation, taxation, and subsidies (in a corrupt marketplace, I believe they’re our only hope) but we urgently need policies based on facts, not commercially driven fantasies and lobbying. We’re wasting time we don’t have and money that would be better spent on wind, solar, and energy storage.

The research tackles one of the biggest hurdles in creating green hydrogen, which is the energy-intensive step of splitting water. Scientists have long worked to improve the special materials that enable this reaction, and the new study reveals that their physical architecture is just as important as their chemical makeup.

The team developed a method to gradually reshape the material over a 24-hour period. What began as flat, two-dimensional sheets slowly and steadily reformed into uniform, one-dimensional rods.

The performance difference was striking. The new rod-shaped materials required substantially less energy to drive the hydrogen production process. They were also remarkably more robust, maintaining their performance for over 200 hours of continuous use with minimal degradation, a significant improvement over the original sheets.

“It’s a bit like discovering that a kitchen knife works much better when you sharpen it into a different shape,” said one researcher, explaining the impact. “The material is essentially the same, but the new form allows it to perform its job far more effectively.”

The rods’ superior performance is attributed to their more orderly structure, which facilitates a better interaction with water molecules and improves the flow of electrical current, all while being more resistant to wearing down.

This intuitive approach to material design offers a promising new path for making green hydrogen production more viable. As industries and governments seek to scale up this clean energy source, such fundamental discoveries could be key to building the efficient and long-lasting technologies needed for a sustainable future.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Green-Hydrogen-1.png,N,,2025-10-23 05:56:23.152762

Around 60% of the economic benefit from Heathrow expansion will be felt by communities outside London and the South-East.","A third runway at Heathrow is one step closer to take-off after the Transport Secretary today (22 October 2025) launched the promised review of the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS), which will provide the framework within which any future expansion will be considered.

Previous work to launch the ANPS in 2018 took 5 years, but the government is committed to going further and faster and today confirmed the reviewed draft ANPS will be published for consultation by summer 2026 in the latest move to back Britain’s builders and get major infrastructure projects off the ground, showing our commitment to delivering progress swiftly but robustly.

Launching the review in Parliament, the Transport Secretary set out that since 2018, new environmental and climate obligations mean an updated ANPS is necessary to allow a decision to be taken on expansion planning applications. The review of the ANPS will include considering 4 key tests that any proposed scheme for Heathrow expansion will have to meet, including on climate change, noise, air quality and contributing to economic growth across the country.

This will ensure planning applications to build a third runway progress fast enough for a final planning decision to be made within this Parliament. The government will seek formal advice from the Climate Change Committee on any relevant amendments proposed to the ANPS to ensure consistency with our net zero commitments.

Today’s milestone on the road to deciding plans for Heathrow expansion follows the approval of Luton expansion earlier this year and Gatwick expansion last month – as the government continues to back aviation projects that will grow the economy, provide highly skilled jobs and help deliver the Plan for Change.

The government has acted swiftly to launch the review of the ANPS so that a decision can be made on a third runway by the end of this parliament to realise the government’s ambition of seeing flights take off from a new runway by 2035.

Following an invitation for potential promoters to submit proposals to deliver a third runway earlier this year to inform the ANPS review, the Transport Secretary also confirmed 2 schemes remain under active consideration. Promoters Heathrow Airport Limited and the Arora Group now need to provide additional details on their plans to clarify associated impacts for investors, affected communities and businesses.

After consideration of this information, the government will announce the single scheme being taken forward to inform the remainder of the ANPS review by the end of November. Any updates deemed necessary to the ANPS would then be consulted on next summer, where communities and stakeholders will be able to have their say.

Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander said:

When we say this government is one that backs the builders, not blockers we mean it. Today is a critical building block which will advance plans for the delivery of a third runway at Heathrow, meaning people can start to experience the full benefits sooner.

As our only hub airport, Heathrow is critical to the UK’s economy, connecting millions of people every year and exporting British businesses across the globe. Enabling Heathrow expansion will drive economic growth and create jobs across the country, delivering on our Plan for Change.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said:

After decades of false starts, we are backing the builders to get Heathrow’s third runway built, creating thousands of jobs, boosting growth across the UK, and making Britain the world’s best connected place to do business.

This government is getting Britain building to kickstart growth and deliver an economy that works for, and rewards, working people.

The government is clear expansion at Heathrow must be financed entirely by the private sector and bring no cost to taxpayers, whilst also meeting rigorous and effective cost controls to deliver this significant infrastructure project as quickly as possible. Financing will come from promoters who submit formal expansion schemes and will include covering any related costs to improvements to transport to and from the airport.

Given the importance of Heathrow to trade and the economy, the government will also assess whether expansion at the airport should be designated as critical national priority infrastructure, meaning that it must meet enhanced security and resilience requirements.

The government’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill will support greener flights, which are essential to ensuring an expanded Heathrow contributes to the UK meeting its climate targets.

The bill will encourage the production of green aviation fuel in the UK by providing economic security for the market to thrive.

This includes ensuring that domestic producers receive a set amount for each unit of fuel they produce. To set the course for net zero aviation by 2050, the government has also invested £63 million to fast track the construction of UK SAF production plants.

A new UK Airspace Design Service will also be established to modernise UK’s airspace, alongside airspace slot reforms to ensure future allocations maximise benefits for passengers, local communities and businesses at expanded London airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick and Luton.

Karen Dee, Chief Executive of AirportsUK, said:

Delivering critical national infrastructure, including airport capacity, is vital if the UK is to increase economic growth. Setting a clear policy framework and providing a predictable, cost-effective and timely approvals process will help bring forward investment, create more connectivity, and drive productivity.

We look forward to working with Ministers to deliver these elements to ensure the UK can remain a world leader in aviation.

Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK, said:

We welcome the strong recognition from government of aviation’s unique role enabling economic growth and activity in all parts of the UK. Airlines support airport expansion, but any scheme at Heathrow must be affordable, deliverable and aligned with the industry’s net zero commitments, principally through the scale-up of advanced SAF and a modernised UK airspace.

We want a growing aviation sector and hub airport to deliver for passengers and businesses everywhere, but not at any cost, and we look forward to working with Ministers to deliver on these objectives.

Jane Gratton, Deputy Director of Public Policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said:

This is great news. After many years in the planning, fast-tracking the process to support a decision on Heathrow’s expansion will be welcomed by businesses across the UK.

A third runway at Heathrow is vital to accelerating economic growth – as the UK’s hub airport and its largest air cargo port, its development will be a huge boost to British business.

Construction projects on this scale are crucial to the future development of supply chains across the UK. Around 60% of the economic benefit from Heathrow expansion will be felt by communities outside London and the South-East.

Chambers believe a third runway at Heathrow, with facilities fit for the 21st Century, will boost trade, attract international investment, improve connectivity, and deliver wide-ranging benefits for the economy.

To deliver an expanded Heathrow on time, the government is also pressing ahead with wider reforms to the UK’s planning systems, including the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which will streamline the delivery of major infrastructure projects through faster consenting routes and more balanced consultations.

This brings the total amount of SAF quotas issued so far in 2025 to around 1.2 MMt, including the first such permits allotted to Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech.

It is not compulsory for the new recipients to fully utilize the allotted permits by the end of 2025, according to the JLC report, but it is also unclear if the companies need to re-apply for quotas next year.

However, the thermal stability and oxidation stability of standard jet fuels may be affected by the addition of SAF, and a better understanding of liquid fuel oxidation kinetics is needed. The development of a kinetically well-defined reactor to study this phenomenon remains a challenge, and it is in this context that a new Si-glass microfluidic reactor with a fluid supply made of inert poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) has been developed. The experimental rig PEEK-ACHU (Autoxidation μChip Heated Unit) was used to investigate the oxidation stability of a SAF surrogate, and the results were compared to Induction Period (IP) measurements obtained in a standard PetroOxy device. A mixture of n-decane and iso-octane was used as the surrogate SAF. The thermal oxidation stability of the mixtures was studied in the microreactor, working at conditions up to 453 K and 40 bar, with a gas–liquid segmented flow that allows the liquid oxidation to occur in homogeneous, self-agitated, liquid slugs, without oxygen diffusion/depletion kinetic limitations. PEEK-ACHU enables residence times as long as 3.8 h to be reached on a 4 in. diameter Si/glass wafer, with visual access to the reactor, and a well-defined kinetic study of the liquid fuel autoxidation. The total hydroperoxide (ROOH) concentration was quantified at the exit of the microreactor using a specifically designed HPLC device with a post-column reactor for iodometric titration. For comparison, the same analysis was conducted on the SAF oxidized in the PetroOxy apparatus with the same residence time. The results show that the microfluidic apparatus can perform reliable autoxidation measurements with well-controlled operating parameters.

In the early stages, incentives are recommended to help build up the SAF market, and mandates can come later, said Dr Thomsen.","- Singapore’s decision to impose a levy on travellers to raise the use of greener jet fuel may have a “dampening effect on air travel”, and the International Air Transport Association (Iata) may not recommend such a policy elsewhere, said the body’s official .

However, given Singapore’s land constraints and limited capacity in producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the levy – which would go to a fund to procure the fuel – would be suitable for the country, Dr Marie Owens Thomsen, the association’s senior vice-president for sustainability and chief economist, told reporters at the Iata World Sustainability Symposium on Oct 22.

On Oct 14, Parliament

passed a Bill to impose a fixed levy on all departing flights

from 2026 to support airlines’ use of SAF.

The target is for SAF to constitute 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, with the goal raised to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Preliminary estimates from the authorities are that economy-class passengers may incur an additional $3 levy for short-haul flights, $6 for medium-haul flights and $16 for long-haul flights, such as those to Bangkok, Tokyo and London, respectively.

Sustainable aviation fuel,

mostly made from waste materials such as used cooking oil, has been deemed the most practical way to decarbonise the aviation industry as it can be blended with jet fuel and used on existing aircraft and refuelling systems without any costly modifications.

Iata – a trade association for airlines – is more in favour of having government incentives to raise the adoption of SAF, as in the US, which is offering tax credits and funding to green fuel producers.

It feels strongly against SAF policies that mandate the use of a certain percentage of green fuel by airlines when the supply of such fuel is still limited.

Such mandates – which have been in place in the European Union and Britain since early 2025 – have driven up SAF prices and subjected airlines to penalties for not meeting the blend when the supply is low, said Iata.

However, the association finds Singapore’s approach to be different and creative, based on its circumstances.

“We are trying to embrace everybody’s innovation, and we’re trying to celebrate those who are actually trying to do something constructive. And I think we definitely have to put the Singapore Government under that bracket...

“They’re actually trying to buy more SAF for use in airplanes. That’s a very good strategy,” said Dr Thomsen at the roundtable on Oct 22 .

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will set up a fund to procure and manage the green fuel.

In contrast, the EU mandate which started in January 2025 puts the onus on aviation fuel suppliers to blend an amount of SAF into the jet fuel they supply to EU airports, starting with 2 per cent in 2025, or face penalties that they can pass on to airlines.

Saudia Group’s vice-president for sustainability Maryam Telmesani griped about the EU mandate at a panel on Oct 22, which also featured the European Union Aviation Safety Agency’s chief environmental protection expert Stephen Arrowsmith and CAAS’ chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng.

Saudia Group owns Saudi Arabian flag carrier Saudia and low-cost airline flyadeal.

Ms Telmesani said: “We fly to Europe, and they only allow the (refuelling) of SAF being produced there. But guess what? There is not enough supply. If the suppliers do not manage their obligation, they have the complete freedom to pass the penalties on to us.”

On Singapore’s policy, Dr Thomsen said she wants to look at the legislation in detail and the finalised levy amount, before assessing it further.

In early 2024, Iata’s chief Willie Walsh had said Singapore’s decision to impose an SAF levy appeared sensible because it aims to raise SAF production, though he warned that increases in airfares would dampen the industry’s growth.

At a press conference on Oct 21, however, he said he was concerned about the policy.

“We believe that the principle that Singapore discussed around the levy makes sense, but the devil is in the detail, and it would appear that the detail now is not aligned with what we had expected to happen,” said Mr Walsh.

“So we need to further study the legislation that has come into place and better understand the objective there,” added the director-general.

Dr Thomsen, who prefers tax benefits for green fuel feedstock producers, grants, guarantees and other incentives, said: “I wouldn’t want to necessarily say that that’s the policy I would want to see for the global SAF market.”

Under the US’ Inflation Reduction Act, green fuel producers can receive tax credits of up to US$1.75 (S$2.30) per gallon of SAF if producers meet wage and apprenticeship requirements, alongside emission reductions.

In the early stages, incentives are recommended to help build up the SAF market, and mandates can come later, said Dr Thomsen.

“If you put a mandate on a product that doesn’t exist, the price is just going to go up,” she said.

SAF typically costs about three to four times more than traditional jet fuel. Iata has said before that the mandate in Europe is inflating costs for airlines through the penalties passed on from the fuel suppliers, nearly doubling prices over the market rates of SAF.

When Parliament debated the SAF levy on Oct 14, Senior Minister of State for Transport Sun Xueling said subsidies and incentives require large and recurring fiscal commitments, which are not fiscally sustainable for Singapore.

Dr Thomsen said: “Let’s give Singapore the benefit of the doubt that this will actually be good, and we also trust Singapore to error-correct if it turns out not to be good.”

Mr Walsh said Singapore officials have been clear in informing the association that if the levy does not lead to greater production of SAF in Singapore, they would review the policy.

Speaking at the Oct 22 panel, CAAS’ Mr Ng said the fund from the levy will be used to buy sustainable fuel or carbon credits associated with the use of SAF.

He added that if market conditions are not ideal, the 1 per cent target may not be met, which the authorities are prepared for.

“Our approach is one where we pay what we can afford. We are not planning to be sustainable at all cost because the SAF market is still very small. The price fluctuations are quite dramatic sometimes.”

Iata is uncertain if the aviation sector can meet the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s 2030 target of reducing aviation’s emissions by 5 per cent through the use of SAF.

The association noted that SAF production is expected to double to two million tonnes in 2025, but that is just 0.7 per cent of aviation’s total fuel needs.

Iata’s Mr Walsh said: “This period needs to see significant investments in the production of SAF... I think it’s going to be extremely difficult to get to 5 per cent in 2030.”

“We believe it was inappropriate to set the 2030 target. We did not believe SAF would be cheaper, and that remains the position today,” he said.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/8d88be62a546348b7973eed3230fe50de7e0abc41c12f64d2554c0791df4b46d,N,,2025-10-22 23:56:11.481780

Players at the industry have, however, been raising concerns with the high high cost of the fuel, lack of coordinated legal frameworks and lack of requisite technologies as some of the challenges facing its roll out.

KQ said the fuel is made from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids feedstocks, such as used cooking oil and other waste materials, which can achieve up to 85 per cent lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel when produced and used directly.

""By applying these verified SAF attributes, the airline has achieved a 50 per cent SAF-equivalent operation on the Nairobi–Cape Town route. This represents a meaningful step in exploring realistic and measurable ways to reduce emissions across its network.""

KQ said the flight was organised as part of the SkyTeam Aviation Challenge 2025 under the theme Impact, which celebrates practical actions that promote sustainability in aviation.

Onboard, Kenya Airways introduced several initiatives under four focus areas.

The initiatives include up-cycled blanket bags and headset covers and reusable cutlery to reduce waste, locally sourced Kenyan coffee and tea, canned beverages instead of plastic bottles and reusable hot drink cups, recycling of onboard waste and reusing service items.

The cabin crew were also involved in creating awareness among passengers about responsible practices.

Hellen Mwariri, chief strategy and innovation officer, said, “This flight shows what can be achieved through collaboration and innovation. It’s a step towards practical solutions that reduce our impact while keeping operations efficient.”

KQ continues to work with government agencies, local innovators and international partners, including IATA, SkyTeam and AFRAA to help build local SAF production capacity in Kenya by 2026.",https://cdn.radioafrica.digital/image/2025/10/c85571ed-dab1-429e-b1e7-b9805a4e8554.png?1761191774021,N,,2025-10-22 23:56:18.166089

Spark’s Take on LNZA Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, LNZA is a Neutral.

LanzaTech Global’s overall stock score is primarily impacted by its poor financial performance, characterized by declining revenues, high leverage, and negative cash flows. The technical analysis provides some moderate support with positive momentum indicators, but the valuation remains a significant concern due to the negative P/E ratio. The absence of earnings call data and corporate events means these factors do not influence the score.

According to the findings, implementation of ReFuelEU aviation has already stimulated increased SAF production capacity within the EU. This positive trend confirms that the EU is on track to meet the overall mandatory SAF blending target in 2030, which is 6%.

The report confirms that almost all SAF used in 2024 was biofuel, produced from used cooking oil (81%) and waste animal fats (17%). This shows that the development of synthetic fuels (eSAF) remains in its early stages in the EU. The SAF market also remains concentrated: 25 fuel suppliers provided SAF to 33 EU airports across 12 Member States. However, airports in five Member States (France, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden) accounted for 99% of supply.

Honda Aircraft Company has taken a major step in aviation sustainability by successfully conducting a test flight powered entirely by a 100% blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The achievement marks a first for a twin-turbine very light business jet manufacturer and highlights the industry's progress toward reducing its environmental footprint.

According to the International Civil Aviation Organization, aviation contributes 12% of all carbon dioxide emissions from global transportation.

In response, manufacturers like Honda Aircraft Company are developing technologies to lower these emissions, with a strong focus on alternative fuels.

Sustainable aviation fuel and emissions reduction

Sustainable aviation fuel is an alternative to traditional jet fuel derived from non-petroleum renewable sources such as woody biomass, fats and greases. It is currently approved for use in commercial flights in blends of up to 50% with conventional fuel.

The adoption of SAF presents several advantages, including flexibility in production technologies and compatibility with existing engine and airport infrastructure.

Its use in a 100% blend could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% compared to conventional jet fuel.

The milestone flight took place over Greensboro, North Carolina, US, with the HondaJet landing at Honda Aircraft Company's headquarters at Piedmont Triad International Airport.

This follows successful ground tests of the aircraft's HF120 engine using 100% SAF in 2022 and 2023.

Amod Kelkar, Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Honda Aircraft Company, says: “We are immensely proud of our Honda Aircraft Company engineering team carrying forward our commitment to the future of aviation by demonstrating that the HondaJet is capable of operating on a 100% SAF blend.

""This achievement is a step toward aligning our business activities with the global Honda goal of decarbonising our business activities by 2050.”

Advanced engine technology and efficiency

Established in 2006 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Honda Motor Company, Honda Aircraft Company has consistently focused on fuel efficiency through advanced aerodynamic designs.

Honda Aircraft Company's headquarters is a LEED GOLD-certified building recognised for its environmental and social benefits.

A key component of Honda Aircraft Company's efficiency strategy is the HF120 engine. Developed from the earlier HF118 engine technology, the HF120 was created in collaboration with General Electric.

The result is a jet engine that offers improved efficiency, leading to lower fuel consumption and reduced noise. Honda prioritised low emissions in the engine's design, making it a cornerstone of Honda Aircraft Company’s environmental objectives.

Accreditation and a sustainable future

The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) has awarded Honda Aircraft Company its Tier-six Sustainable Flight Department Accreditation.

This is the highest level of recognition from the NBAA, acknowledging Honda Aircraft Company's commitment to a sustainable future for aviation.

Honda Aircraft Company earned this for its increased use of SAF, improving the fuel efficiency of the HondaJet and implementing other measures to minimise the environmental impact of its aircraft.

Microsoft has purchased the renewable diesel to use for backup generators in data centers.","Four years ago, there were high hopes in agriculture for the future of sustainable aviation fuel. The airlines seemed to be all in, joining the Biden administration in announcing a commitment, known as the “Grand Challenge,” to use 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030.

For farmers, SAF offered a long-term market to compensate for the decline in demand for ethanol as cars continued to become more efficient and electric vehicles more common.

But the SAF industry is still struggling to take off. The Biden administration and the Grand Challenge are gone. And a critical tax credit for the SAF industry, which needs multiple forms of subsidies and incentives to be competitive, has been slashed from $1.75 to $1 a gallon.

The cut in the 45Z clean fuels tax credit made in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill leaves SAF with the same subsidy as fuels like renewable diesel that use many of the same feedstocks, including soybeans and corn, but are cheaper to produce than SAF. Imported feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, also were made ineligible for the credit.

The cut to the 45Z credit caused concern that investment dollars needed to build up SAF will now be more likely to go to the more established market for green diesel used to power trucks, buses and other heavy modes of transportation.

“These projects are not attracting private capital, and so the role of government … in helping launch the industry, is super important,” said Bruce Fleming, CEO of Montana Renewables, one of the few plants now producing SAF at commercial scale, making it a bright spot in the fledging industry. Starting next year, Montana Renewables SAF will be shipped to a Minneapolis-St. Paul facility for use by Delta Air Lines.

“Currently, the SAF market is a mixed bag of policies and producers who are facing different challenges and realities,” said Pat Gruber, CEO of Gevo, which plans to make SAF from corn ethanol in North Dakota.

“In the end, products must be economical to be adopted. That’s a fact.”

Phillips 66 converted a plant in Rodeo, California, to produce renewable diesel and SAF, but during the company’s most recent earnings call, company executives lamented the restrictions on 45Z and the RFS, which the Trump administration is proposing to limit to North American feedstocks.

Phillips 66 President and CEO called the renewable fuels business a “strategic asset” to the company but said its losses “are unacceptable and unsustainable.”

The refiner reported losses from its renewable fuels business of $185 million in the first quarter and $133 million in the second.

Another current SAF producer is Diamond Green Diesel, based in Texas and a project of refining giant Valero Energy and Darling Ingredients.

U.S. SAF production has grown from 5 million gallons in 2021 to over 100 million gallons last year, but production is running well short of its current capacity of 465 million gallons, Andreea Moyes, global head of sustainability for Air bp, said at a recent SAF industry conference in Houston.

“What's concerning to me is that with all the investment that has happened and all this capacity that was unlocked in 2025 we don't see that capacity utilization fully yet, and we have to understand why, because this is not good news for the projects in the pipeline,” Moyes said.

To be competitive with other fuels and markets such as Europe and the United Kingdom, which are imposing SAF mandates on airlines, U.S.-produced SAF needs incentives worth several dollars beyond the value of the 45Z credit and credits that can be earned through the Renewable Fuel Standard, she said.

She said the 75-cent incentive that SAF originally had in the 45Z credit was enough to cover the extra cost to refiners of producing SAF rather than renewable diesel from the same feedstocks.

Reema Bari, head of Aviation Americas for Shell, says the industry faces two major challenges: One is ensuring demand for projects that can take four to seven years to complete. The other is getting “bipartisan support for … policies that incentivize these complex and technologically advanced projects.”

‘Book and claim’ advanced as one solution to cost

Different projects have different economic challenges depending in part on the feedstocks they’re using and their locations. For Montana Renewables, which can produce SAF from oilseeds, corn oil, used cooking oil and tallow, one of those challenges is the cost of getting the fuel to the airports where it will be used. Shipping SAF from Great Falls, Montana, to Los Angeles, for example, costs about 37 cents a gallon.

Fleming and others in the industry argue that it would make more sense to sell the carbon benefits separately from the fuel through what’s known as a “book and claim” process. Corporations that want climate credits, for example, can buy the credits for SAF that’s been produced, and the fuel is then sold for its value as jet fuel at airports close to the SAF plants.

“If you want to make the cost lower for the final product, how about if we don't have to ship it physically and put it in the wing of a certain tail number of a certain aircraft?” said Fleming. “How about if we let the book and claim system do that for us?”

Such book and claim services currently exist, but usage has been limited. Some critics say such trading in credits is prone to fraud. Notably, a group of Republican state attorneys general has recently launched an investigation into the use of renewable power credits in the tech industry.

In a letter to Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon, the AGs alleged the credits allow the industry to “engage in a shell game whereby they purchase unbundled ‘renewable energy certificates’ (RECs) and then claim the ‘renewable’ attribute of energy that is used by someone else as their own energy usage.”

Alcohol-to-jet retains DOE support even as CO2 pipeline stalls

Hopes for turning ethanol into SAF have been slow to ramp up, but a leading company, Gevo, received some good news recently when Trump’s Energy Department recently extended a loan guarantee commitment for the company’s first ethanol-to-jet fuel (ETJ) facility.

Gevo is looking at moving the loan guarantee from a Lake Preston, South Dakota, site to a smaller plant in North Dakota the company acquired earlier this year. Gevo’s original plans for producing SAF at the 60-million-gallon-a year Lake Preston site have been hampered as the planned Summit carbon dioxide sequestration pipeline has stalled in the state.

Carbon from the 30-million-gallon-a year North Dakota plant can be buried near the facility. Switching the loan commitment to the North Dakota plant also would significantly shrink the size of DOE's $1.46 billion loan guarantee.

Gevo has said the South Dakota project is on hold until there’s clarity around the Summit situation. Meanwhile, it is aiming to start making SAF in North Dakota around 2029-2030.

A separate ETJ plant developed by LanzaJet in Georgia has yet to begin commercial production. Its plan to ramp up using Brazilian sugarcane ethanol has already run into challenges because of new tariffs and the restrictions on foreign feedstocks. The company missed a goal of starting full operations by the end of September.

Meg Whitty, vice president of corporate affairs and marketing for LanzaJet, said the company plans to start production “very, very soon” at a rate of about 9 million gallons of SAF and a million gallons of renewable diesel a year. Microsoft has purchased the renewable diesel to use for backup generators in data centers.

LanzaJet is looking at using as a feedstock a waste starch slurry derived from wheat and corn, she said.

Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy, an ethanol industry trade group, told Agri-Pulse SAF remains a “long-term” growth opportunity for her industry. But she suggested in a speech at the SAF North America conference in Houston that the SAF industry has to shift its message from focusing on climate benefits to the benefits it would provide to farmers and rural America.

“There’s a lot in terms of the value proposition here, but we have to talk about it in a way that's going to speak to the people who are making the decisions right now, and carbon performance is not going to speak to this administration,” she said in an interview.",https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/Associated%20Press%20photos/Dec%202023/AP_Dec_23_Boeing_jet_SAF.jpg?height=635&t=1754419406&width=1200,N,,2025-10-22 16:01:19.887724

By Victoria Heath

Each day, more than 100,000 flights take off and land around the world. One of the most common ways of travelling from nation to nation, flying has surged in popularity. Global passenger numbers now surpass pre-pandemic levels.

As flying becomes a more common mode of transport, the planet is experiencing another increasingly prevalent matter: climate change. Across time, warmer temperatures are leading to a range of adverse weather phenomena: increased droughts and floods, more severe storms and changing rainfall patterns. In short, these meteorological events are impacting the way we fly.

But how exactly is climate change impacting the aviation industry? And how exactly can we mitigate against these changes, to ensure flying remains a smooth and enjoyable experience for travellers?

1) Hotter air means heavier planes

As temperatures rise around the world, air density declines. If air is less dense, for the same speed that a plane takes off, there is less lift – meaning the aircraft may potentially not become airborne.

To compensate, the aircraft must either fly faster or reduce its weight before take off. According to one study, under future warming predictions, 10-30 per cent of departures might need weight restrictions. This means on very hot days, airlines may offload passengers, cargo or reduce fuel reserves – reducing revenue per flight.

Another means of mitigating the impact of low air density is to increase runway length. One example of a Boeing 737-800 in a study would require anywhere between 3.5 metres to 168.8 metres of extra runway to take off, depending on the location. Even in modest warming scenarios, takeoff distances at many airports would require around an extra 100 metres of runway.

While major airports may be able to accommodate such requests for longer runways, airports with shorter or constrained runways may become more vulnerable.

To entirely avoid warmer temperatures – and the dreaded lower air density – airlines may entirely shift departure windows so that aircraft only take off during the cooler hours of early mornings and late evenings.

2) Worsening turbulence

Most aircraft travel at altitudes between 30,000 and 40,000 feet, flying through high-altitude jet streams. These are narrow corridors of fast-moving air, and form where warm tropical air meets cool polar air.

However, as the planet warms, these temperature gradients are shifting. The lower layer of the atmosphere – the troposphere – is warming rapidly, while the stratosphere above it is cooling. This pattern causes what is known as vertical wind shear, a key driver of clear-air turbulence, the kind of turbulence that hits with little warning.

Studies prove that clear-air turbulence is on the rise in recent years. Between 1979 and 2020, the amount of severe clear-air turbulence increased by 55 per cent, an uptick linked directly to changes in the upper atmosphere driven by climate change.

This paints a concerning picture for the future of aviation travel. One study estimated that by 2050 to 2080, under a moderate climate scenario, severe turbulence in the North Atlantic flight corridor could double or even triple.

To avoid turbulence zones, aircraft may need to reroute or change altitude, increasing fuel consumption and emissions. In addition, repeated turbulence encounters can worsen the structural integrity of planes, meaning airlines may face rising maintenance schedules and costs.

3) Extreme weather

Flying safely often depends on stable, predictable weather. Yet the planet’s warming atmosphere is making stronger storms, heavier rainfall and more lightning all the more common, impacting flights.

Between 2014 and 2023, weather related delays in the European airspace network increased by nearly 30 per cent, largely due to storms, high winds and thunderstorms that forced planes to either divert or become grounded. According to EuroControl, a pan-European organisation dedicated to supporting European aviation, such an increase can be attributed to ‘more frequent and more intense meteorological phenomena consistent with observed climate change trends’.

In particular, heavy rainfall can also lead to a range of problems for planes, from runway and taxiway flooding to reduced braking performance. Already, major airpots such as Miami International and Shanghai Pudong are strengthening their flood defences to help mitigate against unprecedented levels of precipitation.

Finally, lightning strikes also pose a threat to aircraft. Warmer, moister air can increase lightning frequency. In fact, a 2014 study projected that for every 1°C rise in global temperature, lightning frequency could rise by around 12 per cent.

4) Flooding and sea level rise

Many of the world’s major airports – such as New York’s JFK and London Heathrow – are built on low-lying land. According to the International Civil Aviation Organisation, more than 100 airports globally are at risk from coastal flooding or storm surges by the end of the century.

Another study, published in 2021, found that if global warming exceeds 2°C, up to 385 airports – nearly 10 per cent of global aviation infrastructure – could be at risk of coastal flooding, including many international hubs.

Flooding of airports can be an economically catastrophic event. Back in 2011, Suvarnabhumi Airport was forced to close during Thailand’s floods, costing the economy $1.7 billion in lost air traffic and tourism.",https://geographical.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1139733572.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 16:01:24.387834
