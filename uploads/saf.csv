This firm commitment was made at the Exclusive Discourse Event organised by Lufthansa Airlines at Radisson Blu Anchorage Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos.

Olayinka Babaoye-Iriobe, director of Air Transport Regulations, Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), who was represented by Evelyn Tanko, Deputy General Manager, Commercial Agreement & Aviation Environment stated that the Authority is empowered by the Civil Aviation Act, 2022 to regulate environmental issues and further to reiterate its commitments to the sustainability of the industry, NCAA has domesticated ICAO Annex 16 on Environmental Protection into the National regulations under Part 16 of Nig. CARS, which covers requirements for monitoring, reporting, and verification of CO2 Emissions for international aviation, and Part 5 addresses aircraft noise and emission certification.

The Director highlighted some of the initiatives of the NCAA on the sustainability of the industry. These initiatives include: The development of a State Action Plan on CO2 Emission reduction from international aviation, Nigeria voluntarily joined the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) during its pilot phase in 2018 and has continued to ensure the timely submission of CO2 emission data from airlines under CORSIA and also leading on a Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) Roadmap for the development and deployment of SAF in Nigeria.

She added that the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) is rolling out Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) at major airports ultimately to reduce their carbon emissions and the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, (NAMA) has implemented Free Route Airspace (FRA) and Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) all efforts for the reduction of carbon footprints and towards the sustainability of the industry.

Key challenges in implementing and scaling sustainability policies within the aviation sector were identified to include: fragmented policy environment, limited data and monitoring systems, financing constraints, regulatory & institutional capacity, and awareness, and industry readiness.

Also speaking at the panel session, Rene Koinzack, the Senior Director (Sales), Lufthansa Sub-Sahara Africa, said that the airline has deployed Science- Based Target Initiatives (SBTI) which comprises modern fleet, efficient flight operations, carbon neutral flying, sustainable aviation fuel, reduction of waste and plastics as part of their effort to sustain the industry.

It was emphasised that airlines, airports, aircraft manufacturers, and regulators must all play their roles to promote eco-friendly practices by lowering carbon emissions, improved fuel efficiency, develop alternative energy sources, and enhance operational efficiency for the sustainability of aviation industry.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Nigerian-Civil-Aviation-Authority-NCAA.jpg,N,,2025-04-19 12:56:31.527543

Belangrijke succesfactoren voor een duurzaam reisbeleid Volgens Maarten kunnen andere bedrijven ook aan de slag met een beleid zoals dat van PwC.","PwC heeft het niet alleen bij het stellen van doelen gelaten. Vanaf 2018 heeft het bedrijf geleidelijk maatregelen ingevoerd om reiskilometers en uitstoot te verminderen. Maarten vertelt: ‘Klantcontact is cruciaal in ons werk, maar we stellen ons altijd de vraag of een fysieke reis noodzakelijk is. Is een online meeting mogelijk? Of kunnen we de ontmoeting met minder collega’s of minder vaak plannen, zodat we minder hoeven te reizen? Als reizen noodzakelijk is, geven we de voorkeur aan auto of trein. Sinds 2024 is voor alle reizen tot 700 kilometer de trein de standaard, mits de reis niet langer dan zes uur duurt. Je kunt altijd aanspraak maken op een eersteklas treinticket.’

‘Moet er toch gevlogen worden? Dan is goedkeuring van een leidinggevende vereist. We zijn hierin sinds 2024 strikter geworden. Voordat een vlucht wordt goedgekeurd, overwegen we verschillende factoren: is een directe vlucht mogelijk, kun je de trip combineren met ander werk, en reis je met niet meer dan vier personen? Ook moedigen we aan om zoveel mogelijk in economy class te vliegen, behalve bij langere nachtvluchten. Zo beperken we de uitstoot van de noodzakelijke vliegreizen die we nog maken.’

Hoewel volledig stoppen met vliegen geen optie is voor PwC, probeert het bedrijf de luchtvaartsector te helpen transformeren door te investeren in innovatie. Sinds 2022 koopt PwC een hoeveelheid biobrandstoffen in die gelijkstaat aan alle gemaakte vliegkilometers, bekend als Sustainable Aviation Fuel, die vervolgens door leveranciers aan het brandstofnetwerk wordt toegevoegd. Omdat er niet genoeg biobrandstoffen beschikbaar zijn om de gehele luchtvaart te verduurzamen, investeert PwC ook in onderzoeksprogramma’s voor de productie van synthetische kerosine. Bovendien hanteert het bedrijf een interne CO2-prijs. ‘Voor elke ton CO2 die we uitstoten, investeren we honderd euro in reductie, compensatie en innovatie. Deze CO2-prijs maken we ook zichtbaar in projecten, zodat klanten bewust worden van de klimaatimpact van hun zakelijke reizen en daardoor andere keuzes kunnen maken’, zegt Maarten.

Belangrijke succesfactoren voor een duurzaam reisbeleid

Volgens Maarten kunnen andere bedrijven ook aan de slag met een beleid zoals dat van PwC. ‘Minder vliegen kan zowel tijd als geld besparen voor je bedrijf. Het is belangrijk om een sterke business case te maken en deze goed te presenteren. Daarbij is het cruciaal om met het bestuur realistische doelen te stellen die bij het bedrijf passen.’

Maarten benadrukt het belang van een “holistische benadering”. ‘Verwacht niet dat je onmiddellijke resultaten ziet door slechts één maatregel te implementeren. Meerdere maatregelen samen zorgen vaak voor het grootste effect. Sommige maatregelen zullen pijnlijk zijn, terwijl andere juist meer comfort bieden aan medewerkers. Het vinden van een balans is essentieel voor acceptatie. Daarnaast is het belangrijk om te monitoren en handhaven. Pas dan kun je zien of je beleid effectief is. Wij zien dit als een continu proces. We voeren halfjaarlijkse analyses uit en op basis daarvan scherpen we onze maatregelen aan of verhogen we onze communicatie hierover.’

Is deze holistische benadering een stap te ver voor jouw bedrijf? Dan raadt Maarten aan om te onderzoeken wat wel mogelijk is. ‘Het is nuttig om te leren van andere bedrijven en bestaande informatie. Sluit je bijvoorbeeld aan bij een coalitie zoals Anders Reizen. De Vliegwijzer biedt bovendien veel tips en inspiratie van ervaren bedrijven.’",https://www.nieuwsbladvoorhuizen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Exclusief-Interview-PwC-Treinreizen-Nieuwe-Standaard-voor-Afstanden-tot-700.jpeg,N,,2025-04-19 11:56:59.718167

But Air New Zealand's path to sustainability has already been turbulent, and there's more rough air ahead.
Hannifin's work may affect your next flight on all airlines beyond Air New Zealand, no matter where you're headed.
Air New Zealand's flight plan for sustainability A bold experiment is underway to turn Air New Zealand green.
They include: Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF): SAF is an alternative jet fuel that reduces carbon emissions across its lifecycle compared to traditional fossil fuels.","Say the word ""sustainable"" around an airline executive, and they'll probably try to change the subject. That's because green air travel is a distant dream.

But not for Air New Zealand.

""We're doing everything we can to become sustainable now,"" says Kiri Hannifin, Air New Zealand's chief sustainability and corporate affairs officer. ""And we're leaving no stone unturned.""

Hannifin is not your typical airline executive. She's too casually dressed, too plain-spoken to fit the stereotype, answering my questions quickly and candidly. Hannifin readily admits she prefers being among the workers at the airport instead of sitting at a desk in Air New Zealand's Auckland headquarters, where I met her.

Air New Zealand is unique among airlines. It's the national air carrier for a geographically isolated island on the far edge of the Pacific Ocean. New Zealand depends on long-haul aviation for tourism and trade, and the airline imports 100 percent of its jet fuel. That creates a paradox. If you cut back on carbon emissions, you could cut yourself off from the rest of the world.

So can you explore the world and protect it at the same time? Hannifin doesn't just hope the answer is yes — she's counting on it. But Air New Zealand's path to sustainability has already been turbulent, and there's more rough air ahead. There have been missteps. Hannifin's work may affect your next flight on all airlines beyond Air New Zealand, no matter where you're headed.

Air New Zealand's flight plan for sustainability

A bold experiment is underway to turn Air New Zealand green. The airline is exploring strategies to reduce its environmental impact. They include:

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF): SAF is an alternative jet fuel that reduces carbon emissions across its lifecycle compared to traditional fossil fuels. The airline recently purchased 30 million liters of SAF for its flights from Los Angeles and San Francisco to Auckland.

Electric planes: Air New Zealand expects to be one of the first commercial airlines to add an electric plane to its fleet in 2025. It's a six-seater, all-electric aircraft from Beta Technologies with a range of 350 kilometers. The airline intends to use the electric plane for short cargo routes from Wellington to Blenheim on New Zealand's South Island.

Next-level conservation. The airline is also experimenting with other sustainability measures. For example, it recently removed single-use coffee cups from one of its flights and encouraged passengers to bring their own cups. The airline has also removed disposable coffee cups from their lounges and replaced them with washable ones. (The bring-your-own-cup experiment was short-lived, but the paper cups in the lounges are gone for good.)

Granted, these are baby steps toward Air New Zealand's goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Hannifin says achieving it will require a ""huge lift"" and she predicts it'll be a bumpy ride as the airline navigates passenger demand, regulations and a need to be profitable.

What's the journey been like?

It's been an adventure so far. One challenge is getting buy-in from passengers. While its customers say they care about the environment, only between 3 and 4 percent buy a carbon offset when they book a ticket.

And then there's the great paper cup experiment. The airline uses hundreds of thousands of landfill-clogging disposable cups every year. But getting passengers on board with conservation efforts has proven difficult. Hannifin recalls a recent flight where the airline scrapped its paper cups on a trial basis.

""We texted the customers twice,"" she recalls. ""We said, 'Please bring your own cups. We're just doing a little trial and we'll give you prizes.'""

Only 10 percent of the passengers brought their cups. Flight attendants handed out Air New Zealand lapel pins and keychains to the participating passengers. Back to the drawing board.

Another giant hurdle: sustainable aviation fuel made from agricultural waste. It's the primary driver of green aviation. There's no clear, consistent global framework to support its widespread use.

Air New Zealand is voluntarily purchasing SAF, placing it at a commercial disadvantage compared to other airlines that continue to rely solely on cheaper fossil fuels. The airline is pushing for a SAF mandate in New Zealand, which would level the playing field by requiring all airlines to use a certain percentage of sustainable fuel.

This lack of regulatory support also hinders the development of a domestic SAF industry, because fuel companies require the assurance of long-term demand before investing in SAF production facilities in New Zealand.

What does this mean for your next flight?

How will all of these initiatives affect your next trip? In the short term, the most noticeable change might be the absence of single-use coffee cups.

As SAF becomes more prevalent, you might be flying with a fuel mix that reduces carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to regular jet fuel. Down the line, the use of electric planes for regional routes may become more common. And the amount of sustainable fuel being used will increase every year.

And what about that 2050 goal? Air New Zealand is far from getting there, and Hannifin says the airline is currently the fifth largest polluter in New Zealand, which, she admits, ""is a terrible position to be in.""

But she says the company is determined to be taken off the list quickly as it adopts sustainable fuels and switches to electric planes.

Hannifin predicts the flying experience itself will change as 2050 draws closer. Faster planes and quieter engines may make it more convenient to get to New Zealand. Sustainability aviation will be at the center of it.

""Travelers will be much more cognizant of where they travel based on climate footprint,"" she says.

It's a slow journey toward sustainability — but one worth taking

If Air New Zealand wants to reach its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, it will require a multi-pronged approach. The airline will have to address not just decarbonization but also waste reduction and broader sustainability practices. It will have to solve the paradox of being a carrier of passengers, some of whom are trying to reach family or experience the natural beauty of New Zealand, with being a polluter.

This odyssey is happening across the tourism industry, as governments and passengers start pressuring air carriers to do more for the environment. So Air New Zealand's journey might affect an airline closer to home soon.

Reality check: With New Zealand entering a recession and Air New Zealand's competitors still using cheaper fossil fuels, it sounds almost impossible. But Hannifin likes those odds.

""We have to really hustle,"" she says. ""But we'll get there. I'm sure of it.""",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/680351d75abd153ea9b71a07/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-04-19 09:56:08.423187

Yet there comes a moment, often during the fifth month of gray skies, when even the most loyal resident starts scanning airline apps for sunshine and something profoundly different. Egypt answers both cravings in one sweep: year-round warmth, legendary hospitality, and a cultural pedigree that predates the oldest Seneca Lake stone wall by four millennia.

The following guide breaks down ten timely, tangible reasons Egypt should rise to the top of your 2025 travel shortlist. Think of it as a fact checked roadmap: each section pairs the latest intel (museum openings, currency shifts, visa updates) with practical tips, so you can move from daydreaming to departure with confidence.

1. Grand Egyptian Museum Finally Opens (July 3, 2025)

Cairo has waited nearly twenty years for the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) to fling open its pyramidal glass façade. The wait ends July 3, when the world’s largest archaeological museum welcomes the general public. Once inside, visitors will encounter 100,000 artifacts, including the full, gilded funerary collection of Tutankhamun, shown together for the first time in a single climate controlled space.

What this Means for Travelers:

A single, ticketed campus beside the Giza Plateau slashes cross-town traffic time; you can pair the Pyramids, Sphinx, and GEM in one seamlessly guided day.

Evening entry slots (announced for late 2025) will allow sunset pyramid views followed by air conditioned gallery strolls, ideal for summer visits.

Local tip: Book GEM tickets the moment your international flights are locked in; daily visitor caps mirror the timed entry model used by the Louvre.

2. E-visa Approval Arrives in Under 24 Hours

Remember mailing passports to consulates? Egypt scrapped that hassle. U.S. and most EU citizens can now apply, pay, and download a 30-day tourist e-visa on the government portal. Many approvals land in your inbox the same day, and the PDF works on your phone, no print-outs required.

Pro move: Submit the form one week out; if immigration requests a quick clarification, you still have days to spare.

3. Year-round Nonstop Flights From JFK Cut Travel Time

EgyptAir’s MS 986 departs JFK around lunchtime three times weekly (schedule expands to daily over summer), landing in Cairo the next morning. The single hop erases the European layover and, crucially, keeps your checked bag on the same aircraft. Even with a six-hour time change, you can clear customs, meet your guide, and reach the Pyramids before noon.

Sleep hack: Choose a window seat on the port side (rows 35–45) for dawn views of the Nile Delta on descent.

4. A Strong Dollar Turns Luxury Into a Bargain

Currency devaluations aren’t great for Egyptians, but they stretch American vacation budgets in a way unseen since the early 1990s. The pound slid to ≈EGP 51 per U.S. dollar in early April after another market wobble, and economists expect it to hover near that mark through peak travel season. Five star hotels that once rivaled Rome’s prices now cost less than midrange Manhattan rooms, and a private, Egyptologist-led day tour averages what a group bus excursion did three years ago.

Bottom line: This is the year to upgrade, think Nile view suites, hot air balloon dawn flights, or a cabin on a boutique dahabiya (see Reason 7).

5. Abu Simbel Sun Festival, a Twice Yearly Sunrise You Can Plan Around

On February 22 and October 22, sunlight pierces the innermost sanctuary of Ramses II’s Great Temple at Abu Simbel, illuminating statues of three gods and the pharaoh himself. Thousands gather before dawn on Lake Nasser’s shore, drums echo across the desert, and the spectacle lasts a mere 20 minutes.

How to catch it:

Fly to Abu Simbel from Aswan the afternoon prior, overnight at a lakeside lodge, and walk to the temple by 4 a.m.

Alternatively, board a Lake Nasser cruise that docks overnight, cabins sell out a year in advance.

6. Unesco Sites Deliver History in High Definition

Egypt packs seven UNESCO World Heritage inscriptions into a country smaller than Texas. From the Pyramids of Giza to the monastic summit of St. Catherine in Sinai, each site layers thousands of years of religious, political, and engineering innovation. Highlights include:

Memphis and its Necropolis – the full pyramid fields from Giza to Dahshur.

Ancient Thebes – Luxor’s east bank temples and west bank Valley of the Kings.

Historic Cairo – 600 plus listed buildings spanning Islamic, Coptic, and Ottoman eras.

Why this matters: Few destinations let you trace an unbroken architectural timeline from 2600 B.C. limestone to 14thcentury marble mosques within one week’s itinerary.

7. Nile Cruises, Culture on Cruise Control

Imagine waking to temple columns instead of city skylines. Modern riverboats (150–200 passengers) and intimate dahabiyas (10–16 guests) glide from Luxor to Aswan on itineraries that double as floating history seminars. Each afternoon, certified guides lead small groups through Kom Ombo or Edfu; evenings bring galabeya parties, cooking demos, or rooftop stargazing under skies unmarred by city light.

Why it clicks with Upstate travelers: If you enjoy pairing Seneca Lake wine cruises with Civil War history tours, a Nile cruise offers the same move-once-see-a-lot convenience—just add 4,000 extra years of backstory.

Ready to sail? Browse these Nile cruises, which feature luxury riverboats, boutique dahabiyas, and familyfriendly itineraries. These cruises include private tours led by certified Egyptologists, seamless air conditioned transfers to iconic attractions across Luxor and Aswan, and culturally immersive itineraries that blend historic insights with modern comforts.

8. Red Sea Resorts Keep Winter Water at 72–75°F

January in New York means sidewalks crunch with salt and wind bites. January in Hurghada means coral gardens sway under 73-degree water, and the hotel’s infinity pool is genuinely warm. Official sea temperature records place February averages at 22.2 °C / 72 °F, balmy enough for snorkelers, divers, and kite surfers chasing reliable wind.

Beyond the beach: desert yoga domes, thalassotherapy spas using salt harvested on-site, and camel-trek sunset dinners offer non-aquatic bliss.

9. Cairo’s Contemporary Art and Music Scene Hits Its Stride

While pharaohs steal headlines, Egypt’s creative class is busy reclaiming abandoned palaces and rooftops for jazz nights, design fairs, and film screenings. The Art Cairo fair held its sixth edition in February inside the Grand Egyptian Museum’s atrium, juxtaposing modern installations with 4,500 year-old statues. Rooftop bars in Garden City host weekly Afro-house DJs, while the Townhouse Gallery’s new satellite space doubles as a co-working hub for animators and podcast producers.

Traveler takeaway: Allocate at least one unstructured evening in Cairo. Ask your hotel concierge for the latest pop-up; the city’s creative calendar moves fast.

10. Fresh Archaeological Discoveries Every Season

Egypt is one of the few destinations where “newly opened” can describe a tomb carved in 1400 B.C. In January, archaeologists unearthed more than 1,000 vibrantly painted blocks from Queen Hatshepsut’s valley temple, alongside a limestone tablet naming her architect Senmut. Finds like these trigger temporary exhibitions, special access permits, and press tour discounts that travelers can tap within months.

Why it matters: Repeat visitors see something genuinely new each trip, rare in world heritage travel, where most attractions are static.

Sustainable Steps You Can Take

Fly economy or purchase SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) offsets when booking.

Carry a filtered water bottle; Egypt’s tap water is treated, and filters reduce singleuse plastic.

Choose a cruise that participates in Nile clean-up days and employs local staff above industry minimums.

Respect site capacity rules at tombs with fragile pigment (guides can suggest rotating tombs with equal artistry).

Secure Your 2025 Egypt Adventure Early and Let TripsInEgypt.com Handle the Rest

Egypt’s popularity spikes every time a Netflix doc drops or an airfare sale hits social media. For those targeting a 2025 trip, experts recommend booking international flights 4–6 months in advance and snapping up domestic tickets (Cairo–Luxor, Aswan–Cairo) soon after.

If you’d prefer to delegate the details, consider these custom-tailored Egypt vacation packages offered by TripsInEgypt.com. These tailored itineraries typically include modern accommodations, private air conditioned vehicles, domestic flight bookings, and licensed tour guides who unlock the deeper narratives behind each site. You’ll also get e-visa support, tipping guidelines, and 24/7 WhatsApp assistance—particularly helpful when local dialects outpace your Duolingo progress.

Final Word – the Joy of Contrast

Travel is partly about contrast: tasting flavors, hearing cadences, and seeing horizons that reset your sense of scale. Few countries deliver contrast like Egypt. One morning you’re tracing chisel marks inside a pyramid; that night you’re sipping pomegranate spritz on a Nile deck while Wi-Fi pings in the background. Add the favorable dollar, new museum buzz, and direct flights, and the equation tilts from “maybe someday” to “why not this year?”

When you’re ready to trade snow boots for sandals and creek ice for camel tracks, Egypt’s temples, reefs, and riverboats will be waiting, stories etched in stone, but memories still unwritten.",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1369212/pexels-photo-1369212.jpeg,N,,2025-04-19 09:56:12.084966

Dia menambahkan, penting untuk mendorong adanya regulasi tentang tata kelola penanganan minyak goreng bekas atau jelantah.

“Menurut kami hal ini sangat penting, karena berhubungan dengan kesehatan lingkungan dan energi,” tegasnya dalam diskusi yang digelar Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional (BRIN) melalui Pusat Riset Sistem Produksi Berkelanjutan dan Penilaian Daur Hidup (PRSPBPDH).

Matias menilai perlu adanya pemetaan rantai pasok minyak jelantah atau Used Cooking Oil (UCO) dari hulu ke hilir dan mengidentifikasi tantangan dalam pengumpulannya.

Perlu juga mengidentifikasi inovasi teknologi pengumpulan, menyusun strategi untuk meningkatkan kapasitas pengumpulan, dan mendiskusikan potensi permintaan dan implementasi SAF.

“Kami menerima produk jelantah sebagai sumber penghasil UCO, terdiri dari rumah tangga dengan bank sampah atau langsung door to door. Sektor industri yang bergerak di bidang makan dan minuman, seperti hotel, restoran, dan cafe,” ujarnya dalam diskusi yang bekerja sama dengan PT Noovoleum Indonesia Investama tentang Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).

Selanjutnya ada UMKM dan kantin, imbuhnya, serta industri pertambangan. Ada juga pedagang kaki lima gorengan dalam penanganan sampah ampas penggorengannya, dan kerupuk/keripik yang kadaluwarsa.

Upaya memanfaatkan jelantah untuk energi terbarukan tak selalu berjalan mulus.

Matias menyampaikan berbagai tantangannya, seperti belum adanya regulasi sehingga dia dianggap melakukan penyalahgunaan. Ketidakpastian pemanfaatan dalam negeri dan pelaku usaha yang tidak terorganisasi dan ilegal.

“Untuk mengatasinya, kami memiliki strategi pengumpulan dengan melahirkan pelaku usaha yang teredukasi dan terorganisasi dari desa sampai provinsi.”

“Meningkatkan kegiatan sosialisasi kepada masyarakat, merangkul dan bersinergi dengan komunitas, organisasi masyarakat, Badan Usaha Milik Desa (Bumdes) atau daerah.

Background: A second front in a long-running war

The U.S.-China trade war first erupted in 2018 when former President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, seeking to address intellectual property theft and trade imbalances. China retaliated, heavily targeting U.S. agricultural products.

Clint Hardy, Daviess County’s extension agent for agriculture and natural resources, said a Phase One agreement in 2020 promised renewed Chinese purchases of American farm goods, but those commitments largely fell short, likely complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic and broader diplomatic tensions.

According to the Associated Press, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office completed a review of Section 301 tariffs on China, recommending both keeping current tariffs and increasing some — including agricultural goods. China responded with threats of new retaliatory tariffs on American imports like soybeans, pork, and vehicles.

The trade war has intensified in recent weeks, with the Trump administration maintaining and in some cases increasing tariffs on Chinese goods, according to the Associated Press. Some rates on strategic products have risen sharply, and China has responded with retaliatory tariffs on American agricultural products. The standoff has disrupted supply chains and fueled concerns about a broader economic slowdown, the AP reports.

As of Thursday, the American Soybean Association, the National Corn Growers Association, and other groups had issued cautious statements urging the administration to avoid using farmers as bargaining chips in trade disputes.

In a state where agriculture plays a critical role in the economy, farmers say the impact could be severe.

Kentucky farmers, officials react

Caleb Ragland, a LaRue County farmer and president of the American Soybean Association, said soybeans are Kentucky’s top agricultural product by gross sales, and any disruption in global markets has far-reaching consequences.

“Soybeans were the largest grossing ag product produced in Kentucky last year,” Ragland said. “About 50% of U.S. soybeans are exported, and until the first trade war in 2018, China purchased more than half of those exports.”

Though exports rebounded somewhat in recent years, Ragland said the U.S. has never fully recovered its market share lost to Brazil and Argentina.

“At the worst of the trade war, U.S. soybean exports to China dropped to about 11%,” he said. “Even today, we’ve only regained about 25% — and we’ve lost a lot of ground we may never fully recover.”

Ripple effects beyond the farm

The consequences, Ragland said, stretch far beyond farms.

“A dollar earned in agriculture usually circulates six to eight times in a local economy,” he said. “It affects local businesses, restaurants, hardware stores, schools, churches — it touches everything.”

Hardy echoed those concerns. Hardy said tariffs don’t just affect commodities like soybeans and corn, but also raise the cost of critical supplies such as fertilizer, herbicides, and machinery parts, many of which are imported.

“When tariffs are placed on imported products farmers need, those extra costs are passed down,” Hardy said. “It raises the cost of production at the same time prices for their crops are falling.”

Farmers are already operating on razor-thin margins. According to Hardy, many made little to no profit in 2023, and expectations for 2025 remain bleak.

“There’s an underlying optimism about growing a good crop,” Hardy said. “But economically, there’s very little optimism about turning a profit.”

Stability in question

Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell said that while the short-term situation is challenging, the current negotiations could ultimately lead to stronger and fairer global trade policies.

“There’s definitely opportunity for short-term pain,” Shell said, “but if we can realign ourselves with strong allies like India, Vietnam, and Australia, we’ll build more stable, long-term markets for our farmers.”

Shell said discussions are ongoing at the federal level about potential support for farmers, but no new subsidy programs tied directly to the China tariffs have been announced. He predicted that more market stability could emerge by this summer if new deals come together.

Still, Ragland urged caution about banking on distant promises.

“The farm economy isn’t strong right now,” he said. “Soybean prices are down about 40% from three years ago, while the cost of production continues to rise. We can’t wait two or three years for a solution — we need action now.”

Farmers are already seeing signs of strain, Ragland added, with some in the state either exiting the business or significantly downsizing.

“We’ve had folks auction off equipment or semi-retire because they can’t cash flow anymore,” he said. “Higher input costs, lower revenue — it’s a bad combination.”

Challenges ahead

While some officials hope to expand domestic consumption through biofuels like ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel, Ragland said those initiatives will take years — and billions of dollars of investment — to materialize.

“You don’t just snap your fingers and double the demand for corn and soybeans domestically,” he said.

Hardy agreed, noting that while domestic demand programs are essential, they can’t fully replace lost export markets overnight.

“We’ve got to figure out how to use more of what we grow here, but it will take time,” Hardy said.

Meanwhile, the immediate threat of widespread asset liquidation looms. Shell said losing more farmland at a faster rate is a real risk if prices don’t improve soon.

“If we don’t stabilize markets, farmers will be forced to sell land or go out of business,” Shell said. “And once farmland is sold, it’s hard to get back.”

He added that it’s a two-pronged strategy at work: rebalancing trade partnerships abroad while investing heavily to grow domestic consumption of agricultural products.

“We have to start consuming more here domestically, whether that be in biofuels, feeding more livestock, or increasing what we do with soybeans and canolas,” Shell said. “The Trump administration is trying to ignite that American consumption spirit, and that’s happening through new programs and investments.”

Hardy said farmers must continue adapting as best they can, but volatility is likely to remain.

“It’s really difficult to make decisions right now,” he said. “Commodity prices, input costs, interest rates—they’re all moving targets.”

Ragland said he remains hopeful — but realistic.

“We need a trade deal, and we need it soon,” he said. “Otherwise, there won’t be many farmers left to benefit from it.”",https://cdn.owensborotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OT-China-Trade-War-AG-1024x536.png,N,,2025-04-19 01:56:25.477918

In this video, Rosie Barnes discusses the state of the aviation industry and its challenges related to carbon emissions, particularly focusing on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).

The aviation sector contributes to 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, but its climate warming impact is approximately 4% when accounting for non-CO2 factors, such as contrails. The current aviation fuel, refined kerosene, has remained unchanged for decades. The necessity for an alternative fuel that can be used with existing aircraft engines is crucial for achieving net-zero emissions in aviation.

SAF, produced from renewable biomass, offers an approach that can directly replace fossil fuels without requiring new aircraft designs. The HEFA process, which utilizes waste oils and fats, is currently the leading method for SAF production, providing significant yields while facing challenges in scaling due to increased feedstock demand.

According to PBS, the aviation industry contributes 4% of global carbon pollution. The heat-trapping gases generated by private jets, which jumped 46% from 2019 to 2023, accounts for nearly half of the aviation industry's total. Flying private takes a big toll on the environment.

Those who fly privately include influencers, CEOs, and world leaders, all of whom deliberately choose private flights despite the environmental costs.

However, one study revealed that flights with few or even no passengers do happen because planes need to return to their home bases. That might be what happened here.

Alternative methods of travel that are less wasteful than flying privately — or flying in general — include carpooling, electric vehicles, and public transportation. This helps reduce heat-trapping gas pollution. In the case of EVs, they produce zero tailpipe emissions.

If you must fly, opt for airlines that actively incorporate sustainable aviation fuel and choose direct, nonstop flights to minimize your environmental impact.

Salah satu strategi utama untuk mewujudkannya adalah melalui transisi dari bahan bakar fosil (avtur) ke Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—bahan bakar terbarukan yang lebih ramah lingkungan.

SAF diprediksi mampu mengurangi emisi karbon dioksida (CO₂) hingga 718 Mega Ton pada 2050, sekaligus memenuhi permintaan global yang diperkirakan mencapai 449 Miliar Liter per tahun.

Indonesia, dengan potensi bahan baku terbarukan yang melimpah, memiliki peluang besar untuk menjadi pemain utama dalam pengembangan SAF.

Peta Jalan SAF Indonesia: Tiga Pilar Utama

Pemerintah Indonesia telah menyusun strategi pengembangan SAF dengan tiga tujuan utama:

Dekarbonisasi Sektor Penerbangan

SAF diharapkan menjadi solusi utama dalam mengurangi emisi karbon industri aviasi, mendukung komitmen nasional dan global dalam penurunan emisi gas rumah kaca.

Kedaulatan Energi

Dengan memanfaatkan bahan baku domestik seperti minyak sawit, minyak jelantah, dan limbah pertanian, Indonesia dapat mengurangi ketergantungan pada impor bahan bakar fosil sekaligus memperkuat kemandirian energi.

Penciptaan Nilai Ekonomi

Pengembangan SAF tidak hanya mendukung lingkungan, tetapi juga membuka peluang ekonomi melalui hilirisasi bahan baku, ekspor, dan peningkatan investasi di sektor energi terbarukan.

Tantangan dalam Produksi SAF di Indonesia

Meski potensinya besar, produksi SAF di Indonesia masih menghadapi sejumlah kendala. Metode utama yang digunakan saat ini adalah Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), dengan bahan baku Palm Kernel Oil (PKO) yang masih menimbulkan kontroversi terkait dampak lingkungan.

Oleh karena itu, penelitian dan pengembangan (R&D) untuk menemukan bahan baku alternatif yang lebih berkelanjutan terus dilakukan.

Dua bahan baku potensial yang sedang dikembangkan adalah Used Cooking Oil (UCO) atau minyak jelantah—limbah rumah tangga dan industri yang dapat didaur ulang—serta Palm Fatty Acid Distillate (PFAD), produk sampingan dari industri kelapa sawit.

Keberlanjutan dalam Produksi SAF

Produksi SAF tidak hanya berfokus pada pengurangan emisi, tetapi juga harus memenuhi prinsip keberlanjutan.

Beberapa manfaat utamanya meliputi pengurangan emisi gas rumah kaca, penurunan ketergantungan pada bahan bakar fosil, penerapan ekonomi sirkular, peningkatan kualitas udara lokal, dukungan terhadap pembangunan berkelanjutan, serta pemenuhan regulasi dan tuntutan pasar global.

Untuk memastikan produksi SAF benar-benar ramah lingkungan, diperlukan pendekatan komprehensif seperti Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).

Metode ini mengevaluasi dampak lingkungan dari suatu produk atau proses, mulai dari ekstraksi bahan baku hingga pembuangan akhir.

Manfaat dan Tantangan Penerapan LCA

LCA membantu mengidentifikasi dampak lingkungan di setiap tahap produksi, meningkatkan efisiensi penggunaan sumber daya, memastikan kepatuhan terhadap regulasi lingkungan, serta memberikan dasar ilmiah untuk pengambilan keputusan strategis terkait investasi dan kebijakan.

Meski manfaatnya besar, penerapan LCA masih terkendala oleh ketersediaan data yang akurat, kompleksitas rantai pasok bahan baku, biaya dan waktu analisis yang tinggi, serta belum adanya standar dan regulasi yang.

Masa Depan SAF dengan Pendekatan LCA

LCA memberikan kerangka kerja penting untuk memastikan produksi SAF berjalan secara berkelanjutan. Dengan pendekatan ini, industri penerbangan dapat mengidentifikasi metode produksi yang paling efisien dan ramah lingkungan.

Hasil kajian LCA juga menjadi dasar bagi pemerintah dan pelaku industri dalam menyusun kebijakan, menarik investasi, dan mengembangkan inovasi teknologi.

Seperti disampaikan oleh Arif Rahman (Postdoc BRIN 2023-2025), integrasi LCA dalam pengambilan keputusan akan memastikan industri penerbangan bergerak menuju masa depan yang lebih hijau.

Dengan komitmen kuat dan kolaborasi antar pemangku kepentingan, Indonesia dapat menjadi pemain kunci dalam pasar SAF global sekaligus berkontribusi pada target Net Zero Emission 2050.

Namun, siapa sangka, Indonesia justru memiliki potensi jelantah terbaik di dunia yang bisa dimanfaatkan sebagai bahan baku energi terbarukan, seperti Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Hal ini diungkapkan oleh Ketua Asosiasi Pengumpul Jelantah untuk Energi Baru Terbarukan Indonesia (APJETI), Matias Tumanggor, dalam Workshop Rantai Pasok Minyak Jelantah Berkelanjutan untuk SAF yang digelar di Gedung BJ Habibie, Jakarta, Rabu, 16 April 2025, seperti dilansir dari laman resmi BRIN.

Menurut Matias, kualitas jelantah Indonesia menempati peringkat pertama dunia berkat bahan bakunya yang sebagian besar berasal dari minyak nabati, yang digunakan oleh sektor hotel, restoran, dan kafe di dalam negeri. “Karena mengikuti asas halal, 95% bahan yang digunakan berasal dari minyak nabati. Ini juga yang diakui oleh mitra luar negeri,” ujarnya.

Sayangnya, meskipun potensinya sangat besar, pemanfaatan jelantah di dalam negeri masih minim. Sebagian besar jelantah hanya dimanfaatkan untuk produk lokal seperti lilin dan sabun. Padahal bahan ini bisa menjadi komoditas strategis untuk bahan bakar ramah lingkungan. APJETI sendiri telah menginisiasi pengumpulan jelantah sejak 2010. Semakin hari, produksi maupun kesadaran masyarakat terus meningkat.

Matias menyoroti absennya regulasi nasional yang mengatur secara khusus tentang tata kelola minyak jelantah. Ini menyebabkan kegiatan pengumpulan masih dianggap ilegal atau menyalahgunakan bahan limbah. Padahal pengelolaan yang baik berpotensi menyelamatkan lingkungan sekaligus menjadi sumber energi bersih.

“Kami ingin dilibatkan dalam penyusunan regulasi karena ini menyangkut kesehatan, lingkungan, dan masa depan energi,” katanya.

Matias menjelaskan bahwa pengumpulan jelantah dilakukan dari berbagai sektor, mulai dari rumah tangga (melalui bank sampah atau sistem door-to-door), usaha makanan-minuman seperti hotel dan restoran, hingga UMKM, kantin, pedagang kaki lima, serta industri pertambangan. Bahkan, mereka juga menangani limbah penggorengan dari gorengan hingga kerupuk kadaluarsa.

Namun begitu, tantangan yang dihadapi tidak sedikit. Mulai dari tidak adanya kepastian pemanfaatan dalam negeri, belum adanya pembinaan kepada pelaku usaha kecil, hingga masih maraknya pengumpulan oleh pihak yang tidak terorganisir secara legal.

Untuk menjawab tantangan tersebut, APJETI telah menyiapkan sejumlah strategi: mendorong lahirnya pelaku usaha teredukasi dari desa hingga provinsi, melakukan sosialisasi masif ke masyarakat, bekerja sama dengan komunitas dan organisasi lokal, serta menggandeng BUMDes dan pemerintah daerah dalam memperluas wilayah pengumpulan hingga ke pelosok desa.

Workshop ini digelar oleh BRIN melalui Pusat Riset Sistem Produksi Berkelanjutan dan Penilaian Daur Hidup (PRSPBPDH), bekerja sama dengan PT Noovoleum Indonesia Investama, dengan pendekatan analisis Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).

Melalui kegiatan ini, diharapkan lahir sinergi antara pemangku kepentingan untuk membangun rantai pasok minyak jelantah yang berkelanjutan dan efisien. Dengan begitu, jelantah bukan lagi sekadar limbah, melainkan peluang besar dalam mendorong transisi energi Indonesia menuju masa depan yang lebih hijau.***",http://bertuahpos.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Potensi-minyak-jelantah-untuk-energi-terbarukan.jpeg,N,,2025-04-19 11:57:27.549401

This now means that all Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites around the world are now using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for their internal operations.

During the course of 2025, all Airbus commercial aircraft delivery centers around the world will offer SAF to customers for ferry flights. This year alone, in 2025, over 600,000 litres of SAF with a 30% blend are expected to be used at the Airbus Mirabel site resulting in a reduction in CO2 emissions of around 400 metric tons.

Benoît Schultz, CEO Airbus Canada said, “On average, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the industry’s progress towards decarbonisation by 2050. It’s a big milestone to now have our Mirabel site in Canada, as SAF capable as our other Airbus sites. It not only means we can test our A220 aircraft using SAF, but we will also be able to deliver them to our customers with SAF too.”

In 2024, 18% of Airbus global fuel mix for the year was SAF. That’s more than 16 million litres of neat SAF. Alongside this, 75% of our aircraft worldwide were delivered with SAF, representing also the importance our customers are placing on decarbonisation.

Management of SAF in Mirabel will be done using the mass balance principle. Once the SAF has been transported and delivered to Airbus Canada, it is blended with the conventional aviation fuel (CAF) also known as Jet-A1 in the Mirabel site’s fuel farm. The dilution of CAF and SAF in the fuel tanks is allowed through established standards and auditable bookkeeping. Airbus Canada has the ambition to deliver SAF Proof of Sustainability (PoS) to A220 customers receiving their aircraft from Mirabel in 2025. SAF has been used in A220 aircraft delivered from our A220 Mobile Final Assembly Line since 2016.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with up to 100% SAF by 2030.

The Airbus site in Mirabel is over 1.5 million square feet and includes, among others, a pre-final assembly line (pre-FAL), two final assembly lines (FAL), a customer response centre (CRC), a flight and integration test centre (FITC), and a brand new delivery centre. Over 3,500 Airbus employees work at this location.

He emphasized that Indian airports, including RGIA, are demonstrating leadership in environmental responsibility, and such efforts can guide the region towards a greener future.

Key carbon management initiatives at RGIA include:

Scope 1 (Direct emissions):

- Adoption of electric vehicles and biofuels

- Establishment of EV charging stations

- Use of low Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerants

Scope 2 (Energy-related emissions):

- 100 per cent reliance on renewable energy sources, including a 10 MWp on-site solar plant

- Use of energy-efficient lighting, HVAC systems, and other operational upgrades

Scope 3 (Third-party emissions):

- Coordination with airlines and service providers to reduce emissions

- Use of electric Ground Support Equipment (GSE) and single-engine taxiing

- Provision of pre-conditioned air at aircraft stands

- Exploration of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) usage

Additional measures include:

- Construction of green-certified buildings like the LEED-rated terminal

- Development of a greenbelt area absorbing around 700 tons of CO2 annually

- Transition to solar-powered ground transport

- Use of smart energy systems and compliance with ISO 50001:2018

U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa is one of a group of GOP lawmakers advocating for the energy tax credits.
“We need more Republicans to stand up and support these clean energy tax credits, specifically because they are bipartisan, they always have been, until now,” Markham said.","Research from The Nature Conservancy found current clean energy tax credits, if kept in place through 2032 would add more than $238 million in annual economic value to Iowa.

Some folks fear the tax credits will be slashed by congressional leaders as they stare down hefty budget cuts and eye Biden-era environmental policies, but advocates of the clean energy credits say they are essential to reaching American energy dominance.

The study looked at clean energy tax credits impacting transportation, power generation, industry and buildings. Those categories comprise sectors from renewable vehicle fuels, to carbon sequestration, to home solar installations and electric vehicles.

Amber Markham, director of external affairs and climate for The Nature Conservancy, said most of these tax credits were established with bipartisan support, but are under attack by Republican officials because they were extended by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

“Rather than just lumping them all together and throwing them out, because somehow it seems like it’s an environmental thing … we need to really, take not a sledgehammer approach, but a scalpel approach, and go in and look at each of them and their impact and what makes the most sense to keep and support.”

According to the study, the tax credits in the power category, followed by the industry category, account for the greatest share of annual economic value added to Iowa.

Markham said cutting the tax credits now would be like “pulling the rug out from under” the individuals, business owners and industries that have already invested in this technology with the expectation of the tax credits.

Monte Shaw, executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said this is true for ethanol facilities in Iowa, which he said have invested “tens of millions of dollars” to be able to receive 45z tax credits for manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel.

“That is why we’re fighting so hard to push back against the people who (want to) rip it out,” Shaw said. “These facilities made good faith investments based on the law of the land.”

Conversely, opponents of the carbon pipeline projects in Iowa are gathering signatures on a petition, specifically urging Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley to cut the 45Q tax credits, which incentivize the carbon sequestration pipelines.

IRFA and other commodity groups associated with the ethanol industry have been pushing for final guidance on the 45z program, which Shaw said would said is “the best tool” to “maximize the Midwest contribution to American energy dominance.”

A comment period for 45z guidance closed April 10. Shaw said the association asked for a long term extension of the program and for the inclusion of the climate smart agriculture practices. He said the climate smart agriculture practices program would help the ethanol facilities meet the low emission standards it needs to qualify for 45z, and it would allow farmers to compete in a global market by quantifying the carbon impacts of regenerative farming practices.

Shaw said it seems like the president doesn’t care about the impacts these tax credits have on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but he should care about the economic benefits they represent to the country.

“If you want to get to American energy dominance, this is a tool that’s right here, in law, that can be implemented aggressively, that will achieve your American energy dominance goals,” Shaw said, speaking specifically about 45z.

Another study, released by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, found that residential energy prices in the U.S. would increase by nearly 7% in 2026 if the tax credits were done away with.

Markham with TNC said renewable energy needs to be in the mix to meet American energy demand, which is expected to increase by at least 2% each year in 2025 and 2026.

“We know that more energy is needed across our nation, so it’s not an either or, it’s an all of the above approach that we need to be taking,” Markham said.

U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa is one of a group of GOP lawmakers advocating for the energy tax credits. Miller-Meeks testified in favor of the credits, in the House Ways and Means Committee, urging her colleagues to develop an “any of the above” strategy to meet energy demands.

“Our energy sector faces significant challenges that demand bold action,” Miller-Meeks said.

She noted the Inflation Reduction Act of the previous administration created some “important energy tax credits that are already driving transformative investments across the U.S. energy sector.”

Miller-Meeks, along with 20 other Republican lawmakers wrote to the House Ways and Means Committee Chair, Rep. Jason Smith, R-MO, asking that any changes to energy tax credits be done in a “pragmatic fashion” without “undoing” programs that are already promoting energy innovation and lowering utility costs.

Markham said the environmental group was grateful for the support of the Iowa representative.

“We need more Republicans to stand up and support these clean energy tax credits, specifically because they are bipartisan, they always have been, until now,” Markham said.

The U.S. House of Representatives adopted a budget resolution April 10, just before leaving for a spring recess, that will allow both chambers to work on a reconciliation package upon their return. Per the adopted resolution, Congress must make $1.5 trillion in cuts to federal spending.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/solar-panels.jpg,N,,2025-04-18 19:57:01.090305

Let’s not sugar-coat it. Decarbonising aviation is like retrofitting a B777 mid-flight. With IATA pledging net zero by 2050 and passengers increasingly judging airlines by their sustainability credentials, we all know the target. The question is how to get there while keeping fleets profitable, passengers happy, and regulators at bay.

There are five main aviation decarbonisation levers in play. Each has its own strengths, weaknesses, and realities. None will work alone. But together, they form the foundation for the sector’s transformation.

Here’s how it breaks down for those of us who live and breathe aviation.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: The Ready-Now Solution

SAF is the most immediate decarbonisation lever available. Drop-in compatible, no need to redesign engines or build new aircraft. It reduces lifecycle emissions by up to 80 percent. The catch is supply and price. Production volumes are low and prices are high, but ReFuelEU mandates are creating a new market dynamic.

Hemp is emerging as an unexpected but serious SAF feedstock. It grows fast, thrives on marginal land, and delivers high oil yields for conversion. Some airports are already evaluating local SAF loops using hemp grown on-site. It’s not science fiction, it’s supply chain resilience.

Electrification: Ideal for Short-Haul, Not Quite There for Long-Haul

Electric aircraft are progressing fast, but energy density remains the bottleneck. They will soon serve short regional routes, offering zero-emission alternatives where infrastructure allows. The potential impact on noise and air quality is massive, especially for airports near urban centres.

However, don’t bet the long-haul strategy on batteries just yet. The technology curve is steep and promising, but physics still matters. Expect hybrid electric systems to play a bridging role in the near term.

Hydrogen: Huge Promise, Huge Infrastructure Challenge

Hydrogen propulsion is a gamechanger in theory. It delivers high energy per kilogram and emits only water. In practice, it requires entirely new aircraft designs and airport infrastructure. From cryogenic storage to fuelling logistics, it is a ground-up rebuild.

Still, OEMs like Airbus are putting real capital into hydrogen concepts. If renewables power the hydrogen production, the emissions savings are unbeatable. But the commercial rollout is likely closer to 2040 than 2030.

Operational Efficiencies: The Underrated Powerhouse

This is the decarbonisation lever with the most immediate impact and the least risk. Better flight planning, optimised climb and descent profiles, single-engine taxiing, and improved ATC coordination all reduce emissions without touching the aircraft design.

New data platforms are enhancing operational decisions in real time. One approach is to use predictive analytics and AI-driven dashboards to constantly identify fuel-saving opportunities. Think fewer delays, less holding, and smarter routings. It is a win for emissions, passengers, and the bottom line.

Carbon Removals: The Necessary Clean-Up Crew

Even in the most optimistic scenario, residual emissions will remain. This is where carbon removal enters the flight path. The key is using removal rather than avoidance. Nature-based solutions like hemp carbon capture can sequester emissions and lock them into biomass and infrastructure materials.

Passengers are starting to expect credible offsetting options. The challenge is to integrate removals seamlessly into their experience without compromising trust or transparency. Platforms now exist to embed this into the booking flow and loyalty systems, offering verifiable removals without greenwashing.

Pulling It Together: From Aspirational to Operational Aviation Decarbonisation Levers

These aviation decarbonisation levers are not hypothetical. They are deployable today in varying degrees. The trick is in combining them strategically. Think SAF adoption supported by data-driven operational efficiency. Think hydrogen development paired with airport infrastructure planning. Think real-time carbon removal embedded into customer engagement.

At Tao Climate, we support this integrated approach. Through tools that enhance operational performance, provide access to scalable SAF feedstock, and build trust in carbon removals, we help aviation stakeholders align with both climate targets and commercial realities.

There is no silver bullet. But there is a clear flight path to net zero. With collaboration, smart investment, and a willingness to innovate, the industry can continue to connect the world without overheating it.

One Last Thought

Decarbonisation is not a marketing exercise. It is a systems challenge that rewards precision and punishes delay. By leveraging these aviation decarbonisation levers in the right order, aviation can lead on climate—not just comply.

The system warns pilots if a plane is already on or about to cross the runway they are approaching.

The flight would also demonstrate their existing Smart-X technology that lets pilots know if they are about to take off or land on a taxiway or if there won't be enough runway to land safely.

Both systems are available as software upgrades on aircraft equipped with Honeywell's popular enhanced ground proximity warning systems, or EGPWS.

SURF-A warned the pilots repeatedly with aural and visual signals about ""Traffic on Runway"" when it detected the King Air sitting at the end of the runway.

The scenario simulates how the system might have provided additional reaction time in situations like the February 2023 incident, in which a FedEx Boeing 767 cargo plane nearly landed on top of a Southwest Boeing 737 attempting to take off from the same runway in Austin.

This scenario is much like the incident from January 2023 when a Delta 737 had to slam on its brakes after an American Airlines jet crossed the runway from which it was trying to take off.

SURF-A is also designed to alert a landing plane if an aircraft is crossing the runway.

It could help prevent incidents like the Southwest Airlines flight that narrowly avoided colliding with a private jet crossing the runway as it descended to land at Midway Airport in Chicago in February.

The system, already on the market, alerted pilots when they tried to take off from and land on a taxiway.

For decades, commercial aviation symbolized human innovation, freedom, and global connectivity. Yet in a warming world, it now also symbolizes a pressing climate dilemma. The global airline industry is responsible for nearly 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions and up to 5% when non-CO₂ effects such as contrails are included. As climate urgency intensifies, public and regulatory scrutiny of aviation’s environmental footprint has grown—forcing the sector into a new era of accountability, innovation, and transformation.

Boeing, one of the world’s largest aerospace manufacturers, is leading a pivotal shift toward sustainability alongside airlines, fuel suppliers, and governments. From investing billions in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to pioneering hydrogen and electric aircraft, the aviation industry is entering a critical phase of decarbonization.

Boeing’s Vision for a Decarbonized Future

In 2021, Boeing announced an ambitious goal: to ensure all its commercial aircraft are capable of flying on 100% SAF by 2030. This commitment places Boeing at the heart of aviation’s energy transition. With programs spanning aircraft efficiency, SAF compatibility, lifecycle emissions tracking, and supply chain sustainability, Boeing’s role is multifaceted.

1. 100% SAF Certification by 2030

Sustainable aviation fuel is the most immediate way for airlines to reduce carbon emissions. SAF can reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. However, it currently comprises less than 1% of global jet fuel use.

Boeing is working with regulators like the FAA and ICAO to certify its entire fleet—including the 737 MAX, 787 Dreamliner, and 777X—for 100% SAF operations. The 2021 test flight of a 777 Freighter running solely on SAF marked a milestone, signaling not only technical feasibility but also Boeing’s resolve.

To support SAF scale-up, Boeing has invested in partnerships with SAF producers including SkyNRG, World Energy, and Neste. These collaborations aim to reduce SAF costs and expand supply in key markets like the U.S., Netherlands, Singapore, and UAE.

2. EcoDemonstrator Program: Turning Labs into Skies

Boeing’s EcoDemonstrator program transforms commercial aircraft into flying testbeds. In 2023, a 777-200 was used to trial over 30 technologies, including noise-reduction systems, lightweight composites, and climate-smart route optimization algorithms.

A key component of the EcoDemonstrator initiative is its real-world testing of SAF blends, hybrid-electric propulsion systems, and contrail avoidance techniques. Boeing uses AI-powered predictive models to understand how minor route changes can reduce contrail formation—an overlooked but potent contributor to global warming.

3. Fleet Modernization and Fuel Efficiency

Aircraft like the 787 Dreamliner and 737 MAX consume 15–25% less fuel than previous generations. Boeing’s design philosophy now incorporates sustainability from concept to decommissioning. New manufacturing techniques, such as 3D printing and advanced composite materials, reduce aircraft weight and emissions.

Airlines across North America, Europe, and Asia are retiring older aircraft and replacing them with more efficient Boeing models. For example, Alaska Airlines is phasing out Airbus jets in favor of 737 MAXs, while Emirates is integrating 777X aircraft into its long-haul strategy.

Airline Industry Collaboration and Global Commitments

1. IATA’s Net-Zero by 2050 Pledge

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), representing 83% of global airline traffic, has pledged net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. This commitment hinges on four pillars: SAF, new propulsion technologies, operational efficiencies, and carbon offsets.

Boeing is working closely with global carriers—like Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, American Airlines, and ANA—to implement sustainable solutions that fit regional realities. For instance, Lufthansa is blending SAF into scheduled flights departing from Frankfurt, while United Airlines has invested in carbon capture startup 1PointFive.

2. Regional Innovations in the U.S., EU, and Asia

In the U.S., the Biden administration’s SAF Grand Challenge aims to produce 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2030. Boeing is advising policymakers and facilitating private sector engagement, particularly in hubs like Seattle, Houston, and Los Angeles.

In Europe, the EU’s “Fit for 55” policy mandates increasing SAF usage, pushing airlines like Air France-KLM and Lufthansa to accelerate sustainability agendas. Airbus and Boeing are engaged in a transatlantic “green race” that could yield breakthrough solutions benefiting the entire industry.

In Asia, Singapore’s Changi Airport has announced SAF blending trials, while Japan’s All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines are co-investing in Japanese SAF production facilities.

Electric and Hydrogen Aircraft: The Next Frontier

While SAF is a bridge fuel, electric and hydrogen aircraft represent long-term climate solutions. Boeing’s involvement in these technologies is progressing steadily, albeit cautiously.

1. Boeing’s Electric Strategy

Through its partnership with startup Wisk Aero (a Boeing subsidiary), the company is investing in autonomous electric air taxis. Wisk’s sixth-generation eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft) is undergoing FAA certification with an eye toward deployment in the early 2030s.

Electric propulsion is ideal for short-haul, urban air mobility applications. Boeing is expected to enter this space more aggressively as battery technology improves and infrastructure develops.

2. Hydrogen-Powered Flight

Boeing is also exploring hydrogen propulsion as a future solution for zero-emission aviation. The company participates in NASA’s Sustainable Flight Demonstrator (SFD) program and is collaborating on feasibility studies in Europe and the UAE.

While Airbus is currently ahead in hydrogen aircraft development, Boeing’s vast supply chain and experience in fuel systems position it well to play a central role when the technology matures.

ESG and the Sustainable Supply Chain

Beyond propulsion and fuel, Boeing is addressing the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects of its operations.

1. Carbon-Neutral Factories

Boeing’s Renton and Everett plants are adopting renewable energy, water reuse systems, and waste reduction practices. The company aims for carbon-neutral manufacturing across its U.S. facilities by 2035.

2. Supplier Sustainability Standards

Boeing has launched its “Supplier Sustainability Rating” program to assess and improve ESG performance across thousands of vendors. From raw material sourcing to end-of-life aircraft recycling, Boeing is pushing transparency and accountability industry-wide.

Greenwashing vs. Groundbreaking: Public Skepticism and Accountability

Despite positive steps, the aviation industry still faces skepticism. Greenwashing accusations persist, particularly around carbon offset programs and the slow pace of SAF scale-up. Critics argue that net-zero pledges lack enforceability, and climate activists continue to push for reductions in flight volumes—especially in Europe.

Boeing and the airline industry must therefore balance technological innovation with clear, measurable progress. Annual ESG reporting, third-party emissions auditing, and transparent timelines for SAF adoption will be crucial to maintaining public trust.

Conclusion: A Flight Path Toward Climate Responsibility

The global airline industry stands at an inflection point. Once seen as a climate laggard, it is now emerging as a laboratory for sustainability breakthroughs. Boeing’s leadership—through SAF development, electric aircraft partnerships, and cutting-edge fleet design—underscores the sector’s potential to decarbonize at scale.

Yet challenges remain. SAF production is still limited, electric aircraft are years away from commercial viability, and global regulatory alignment is inconsistent. But with collaboration, investment, and innovation, the vision of sustainable air travel is becoming more tangible.

For travelers, this future means not just guilt-free flying—but a world where aviation continues to connect people and economies without compromising the planet. And for Boeing, it’s a legacy not just of engineering excellence, but of environmental leadership.

The aviation sector is witnessing a substantial shift towards sustainability, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) taking center stage as a solution to reduce carbon emissions. In North America, the U.S. is advancing its production capabilities, while Canada is laying down a supportive policy framework. Despite these efforts, challenges such as policy intricacies, investment shortfalls, and trade tensions lie ahead.

U.S.: Scaling Up Production with Strategic Investments

Infrastructure Developments

SAF infrastructure in the U.S. has undergone significant growth. As reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, SAF production has surged from 2,000 barrels per day in 2020 to 19,000 barrels per day in 2023, with expectations to hit 51,000 barrels per day by 2025. This increase is largely due to the integration with renewable diesel facilities, where the U.S. holds a leading position globally.

Key investments in SAF projects by the U.S. Department of Energy include:

Calumet’s Montana Facility: Receiving a conditional $1.44 billion loan guarantee, this plant is set to produce 315 million gallons of biofuels yearly, with a major share being SAF.

Gevo’s Net-Zero 1 Project in South Dakota: Supported by a $1.46 billion loan guarantee, this facility will be the first to convert corn starch to SAF at a commercial scale, targeting 55 million gallons yearly.

Facilities such as World Energy’s Paramount in California and Marathon’s Dickinson in North Dakota also contribute to SAF output alongside renewable diesel.

The U.S. SAF market is poised for significant growth, projected to escalate from $0.86 billion in 2024 to $6.97 billion by 2030, as per a MarketsandMarkets analysis. This momentum is fueled by environmental concerns, government policies, and successful SAF trials, such as United Airlines' 100% SAF commercial flight.

Policy and the SAF Grand Challenge

With the SAF Grand Challenge, the U.S. aims to produce 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050 to meet the projected aviation fuel demand. Current production levels fall short, with less than 100 million gallons produced annually, representing less than 0.1% of the country's jet fuel consumption.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, offering a $1.25-$1.75 per gallon benefit to SAF producers. However, concerns about long-term subsidy stability, especially amid political shifts, pose risks to investment.

Companies like United Airlines, JetBlue, and Delta have inked major SAF supply contracts, while Airbus and Boeing are channeling investments into technologies such as alcohol-to-jet and Fischer-Tropsch.

Canada: Building a Base for Future Expansion

Production and Import Initiatives

Canada currently lacks commercial SAF production but is making moves toward change. Air Canada has engaged with Neste to acquire 77.6 million liters (20.5 million gallons) of SAF, marking Canada's first SAF import. Deliveries have commenced at the Port of Vancouver, with access to Vancouver International Airport.

The Canadian government has pledged over CAD 11 million for clean fuel projects, fostering early-stage facilities to transform forest biomass, waste oils, and municipal waste into low-carbon fuels.

While Canadian specifics are not elaborated in the MarketsandMarkets forecast, North America is positioned for rapid expansion, with the global SAF market anticipated to climb from $1.1 billion in 2023 to $16.8 billion by 2030, heavily driven by U.S. strides.

Policy Challenges and Market Dynamics

Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR) demand lower carbon fuel intensity, establishing a compliance market that could entice SAF producers. However, SAF production costs are significantly higher than renewable diesel. To counter this, the Canadian Council for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (C-SAF) advocates for:

Extending the Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit to SAF facilities

Price assurance via Contracts for Difference (CfD)

Joint public-private investments targeting regional SAF hubs

These strategies mirror the successful models for hydrogen and renewable electricity in Canada.

Growth Obstacles

Despite policy efforts, Canadian SAF development faces significant challenges:

Higher Costs: Without U.S.-like subsidies, Canadian SAF costs remain significantly higher than Jet A fuel prices.

Reluctance from Investors: Funds are diverted to U.S. projects with better incentives.

Logistical Gaps: Lack of established systems for feedstock collection and SAF blending.

Impact of U.S.-Canada Trade Issues on Biofuels

In March 2025, the U.S. imposed a 10% tariff on Canadian biofuels, including ethanol and biodiesel. While SAF wasn't explicitly mentioned, these tariffs affect feedstock markets and investor confidence.

Trade tensions could hinder emerging SAF supply chains in North America. Many Canadian SAF projects depend on U.S. Midwest feedstock imports. These trade barriers add risk, potentially stalling biorefinery investments.

Industry leaders from both nations emphasize the need for cross-border cooperation to maintain cohesive climate-oriented energy markets. Without aligned incentives and trade facilitation, Canada's production may lag, while the U.S. confronts policy unpredictability.

Assessing the SAF Landscape in North America

SAF is vital for achieving aviation sector decarbonization in both the U.S. and Canada. Nonetheless, production is still in early stages, hampered by infrastructural, cost, and policy uncertainties. The U.S. has advanced through government incentives and commercial collaborations yet hasn't met its ambitious SAF Grand Challenge targets. Meanwhile, Canada is setting the groundwork with policies and imports but requires substantial investments to transition from consumption to production.

For North America to lead globally in SAF, a cohesive regional strategy is crucial, involving technology deployment, feedstock coordination, stable incentives, and trade policy alignment. The forthcoming five years will determine if SAF evolves from a limited alternative to a sustainable aviation cornerstone across the continent.",https://usa-works.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/North-Americas-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-Efforts-Challenges-and-Growth.jpg,N,,2025-04-18 16:56:51.795103

“United continues to lead from the front when it comes to climate change action,” said United CEO Scott Kirby in a statement. “Today’s SAF flight is not only a significant milestone for efforts to decarbonize our industry, but when combined with the surge in commitments to produce and purchase alternative fuels, we’re demonstrating the scalable and impactful way companies can join together and play a role in addressing the biggest challenge of our lifetimes.”

The demonstration flight, which departed with more than 100 passengers from Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and landed at Washington, D.C.’s Reagan National Airport will be on a new United 737 MAX 8 and use 500 gallons of SAF in one engine and the same amount of conventional jet fuel in the other engine to further prove there are no operational differences between the two.

SAF is an alternative fuel made with non-petroleum feedstocks and has the potential to deliver the performance of petroleum-based jet fuel but with a fraction of its carbon footprint. Airlines are currently only permitted to use a maximum of 50% SAF on board. The SAF used on the flight is drop-in ready and compatible with existing aircraft fleets.

United operated this flight in partnership with Boeing, CFM International, Virent, a subsidiary of Marathon, and World Energy, a commercial SAF producer.

United’s Eco-Skies Alliance program was launched in April 2021 and has contributed toward the purchase of more than 7 million gallons of SAF this year alone. With its nearly 80% GHG emissions reductions on a lifecycle basis compared to conventional jet fuel, this is enough SAF to eliminate approximately 66,000 metric tons of GHG emissions or enough to fly passengers more than 460 million miles. The program has nearly 30 participants including companies like DHL Global Forwarding, HP Inc., and Nike.

The SAF flight and new Eco-Skies Alliance participants are among the latest accomplishments towards United’s goal to be 100% green by reducing its GHG emissions 100% by 2050 without relying on traditional carbon offsets.

SAF is a liquid fuel derived from renewable sources.

Its use is primarily driven by the need for security of fuel supplies through lower reliance on conventional fuels.

The refueling at RAAF Base East Sale demonstrated the Australian Defence Force’s ability to pivot to use the fuel when it is produced domestically in coming years.

All ADF aircraft are certified to use SAF, which is compliant with existing military aviation-fuel standards and consistent with standards used by Australia’s allies and partners.

In North America, the United States is scaling up production capacity, while Canada is establishing a policy and infrastructure foundation to support future growth. However, the path forward is complex, shaped by policy dynamics, investment gaps, and emerging trade disputes.

United States: Production Acceleration Backed by Investment and Policy

Capacity and Infrastructure Expansion

The United States has significantly expanded its SAF infrastructure. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), SAF production has increased from 2,000 barrels per day in 2020 to 19,000 barrels per day in 2023, with projections reaching 51,000 barrels per day by 2025. These gains are primarily attributed to co-processing at renewable diesel facilities, an area where the U.S. leads globally.

The U.S. Department of Energy has made notable investments in next-generation SAF projects:

Calumet’s Montana Facility: With a conditional $1.44 billion loan guarantee, this plant aims to produce 315 million gallons of biofuels annually, with SAF comprising a significant share.

Gevo’s Net-Zero 1 Project in South Dakota: This facility received a $1.46 billion loan guarantee and will become the first commercial-scale operation converting corn starch to SAF, aiming for 55 million gallons annually.

Additional contributors include World Energy’s Paramount facility in California and Marathon’s Dickinson plant in North Dakota, both of which support SAF production alongside renewable diesel.

According to a MarketsandMarkets forecast, the U.S. SAF market is expected to grow from $0.86 billion in 2024 to $6.97 billion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 46.8%. This expansion is driven by rising environmental concerns, supportive government policies, and successful demonstrations of SAF integration—such as United Airlines’ use of 100% SAF on a commercial flight.

Policy Support and the SAF Grand Challenge

The U.S. SAF Grand Challenge targets the production of 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050—covering 100% of projected U.S. aviation fuel demand. Current production, however, remains below 100 million gallons annually, less than 0.1% of total U.S. jet fuel consumption.

To meet these targets, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, offering a $1.25-$1.75/gallon incentive for SAF producers. However, uncertainty around long-term subsidies—especially under shifting federal administrations—casts doubt over capital investments.

United Airlines, JetBlue, and Delta have made significant SAF offtake agreements, while Airbus and Boeing are investing in SAF pathways, including alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) and Fischer-Tropsch technologies.

Canada: Establishing a Foundation Amid Global Competition

Domestic Production and Imports

Canada currently lacks commercial SAF production. However, recent developments signal a strategic shift. In late 2024, Air Canada signed a deal with Neste for 77.6 million liters (20.5 million gallons) of SAF—the first time SAF has been imported for use in Canada. Deliveries began at the Port of Vancouver, with pipeline access to Vancouver International Airport.

Additionally, the Canadian government committed more than CAD 11 million to clean fuel projects, supporting early-stage SAF facilities that convert forest biomass, waste oils, and municipal waste into low-carbon fuels.

While specific Canadian projections are not detailed in MarketsandMarkets’ global outlook, North America as a whole is poised for rapid growth. The global SAF market is expected to grow from $1.1 billion in 2023 to $16.8 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 47.7%—with the United States driving much of that expansion.

Policy and Market Mechanisms

Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR), which require a reduction in carbon intensity of fuels, create a national compliance market that could attract SAF producers. However, SAF remains too costly compared to renewable diesel. To bridge this gap, industry coalitions such as the Canadian Council for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (C-SAF) are advocating for:

Extension of the Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit to SAF facilities

Price guarantees through Contracts for Difference (CfD)

Public-private investment partnerships for regional SAF hubs

These recommendations echo the success of hydrogen and renewable electricity investment frameworks in Canada.

Barriers to Growth

Despite policy momentum, Canadian SAF development faces hurdles:

Cost disadvantage: Without U.S.-style subsidies, Canadian SAF costs remain 3–5x higher than Jet A fuel.

Investor hesitancy: Capital flight to U.S. projects offering more generous incentives.

Supply chain gaps: Lack of established logistics for feedstock aggregation and SAF blending.

U.S.-Canada Trade Tensions Threaten Cross-Border Biofuels Supply

In March 2025, the U.S. enacted a 10% tariff on Canadian biofuels, including ethanol and biodiesel. Though SAF is not directly named, the tariffs affect feedstock markets and investor confidence.

These trade actions could disrupt emerging North American SAF supply chains. For instance, several Canadian SAF proposals rely on feedstock imports from the U.S. Midwest. Trade friction increases risk premiums, potentially stalling biorefinery investment.

Industry leaders from both countries have urged for binational coordination to prevent fragmentation of climate-aligned energy markets. Without aligned SAF incentives and mutual trade facilitation, Canada may continue to lag in production while the U.S. grapples with policy volatility.

North America’s SAF Reality Check

SAF is essential for meeting aviation decarbonization targets in both the U.S. and Canada. However, production remains nascent, hindered by infrastructure gaps, high costs, and policy uncertainty. While the U.S. has made measurable gains through federal subsidies and commercial partnerships, it has not reached the scale required to meet its own SAF Grand Challenge goals. Canada, meanwhile, is establishing policy frameworks and initiating imports but needs bold investments to become a producer, not just a consumer.

For North America to become a global SAF leader, a harmonized regional strategy is needed—one that includes technology deployment, feedstock alignment, consistent incentives, and trade policy cooperation.

This time, the world’s second-largest mining company is partnering with AMG Metals & Materials (AMG M&M) to explore the feasibility of setting up a large-scale low-carbon aluminium production facility in the country.

The proposed project includes plans for up to 1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of primary aluminium and 2 mtpa of alumina, powered entirely by renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, backed by pumped hydro storage. In its first phase, the partners are evaluating the potential of establishing a 500,000 tonnes per annum aluminium smelter at a suitable location in India.

AMG M&M, promoted by the founders of clean energy company Greenko and AM Green, will work closely with Greenko to develop a firmed renewable energy infrastructure to support the project. Rio Tinto will focus on the supply of alumina and evaluate the most viable smelting technology for the initiative.

This move marks a significant shift towards sustainable materials production and aligns with Rio Tinto’s global strategy to expand its low-carbon aluminium portfolio. India, with its rapid industrial growth and increasing demand for decarbonised supply chains, presents a strategic opportunity for both players.

The project, once operational, could address growing global demand for low-emission aluminium across sectors like automotive, construction, and packaging. With aluminium consumption reaching 70 million tonnes globally, low-carbon aluminium is emerging as a preferred material for climate-conscious industries.

The development may require a total power input of 7–8 GW, supplied through 1.8–2.0 GW of wind and solar energy backed by hydro storage, and could demand an investment of $5–7 billion across phases.

Though India is the second-largest aluminium producer globally, it continues to rely heavily on bauxite imports. The plan includes sourcing bauxite from Rio Tinto’s Australian mines, potentially bridging India’s raw material gap and supporting exports of low-carbon aluminium to Europe.

The MoU is seen as a step towards enhancing India’s role in clean manufacturing while creating a foundation for reliable and cost-effective aluminium production backed by green energy.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/04/18/Rio-Tinto.jpg,N,,2025-04-18 11:57:10.333428

It will supply the fuel to Japanese airline companies for a cleaner alternative to traditional air travel.

As Reuters reported, Cosmo planned production at its Osaka-based Sakai refinery earlier this year. It aimed to produce 30,000 kiloliters of sustainable aviation fuel per year by April.

The company supplies eco-friendly fuel to Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways. This commitment is significant because it is Japan’s first domestically produced green fuel for airlines.

Cosmo’s sustainable fuel is made from cooking oil and is the first large-scale production of its kind in the country. The refiner worked with two other companies to produce it but declined to provide details about the fuel’s price and volume.

The news from Japan is encouraging worldwide because of how sustainable aviation fuel can reduce the harmful air pollution associated with traditional plane travel.

Watch now: Delta announces innovative plans for its next 100 years of air travel

The aviation industry is responsible for about 2% of global energy pollution. This contribution impacts our planet’s overheating and leads to public health risks and extreme weather events.

In other parts of the world, sustainable aviation fuel companies like LanzaJet have been creating millions of gallons of alternative fuel to offset air travel pollution. That company’s fuel is made from low-carbon intensity ethanol, or grain alcohol, using corn.

Another company, OXCCU, has been creating jet fuel from air pollution using renewable energy and a combination of hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

As a traveler, you can look into flying on planes powered by sustainable fuel and support airlines’ efforts to embrace fuels with lower carbon impacts. For example, Delta has been actively working to use sustainable fuels to reduce the environmental impact of its flights.

Until sustainable fuel flights become more readily available, you can change the way you travel by embracing train travel and vacationing close to home in places that don’t require a flight. When you do fly, consider eco-friendly travel destinations to help minimize your adventures’ overall environmental impact.","https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/glide/image/fetch/https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fny%2Fapi%2Fres%2F1.2%2FnLL.wDuHLlhfBZWvU_de4w--%2FYXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fmedia.zenfs.com%2Fen%2Fthe_cool_down_737%2F6e78cf402ed670ad7be813216d2c2ba0?w=1920&resize=1920,1075&ssl=1",N,,2025-04-18 10:56:28.090820

The latest test, which is gathering data from a Joby Aviation demonstrator aircraft, looks at another kind of wind – that which is generated by the aircraft themselves.
Joby flew its air taxi demonstrator over NASA’s ground sensor array near the agency’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California producing air flow data.
This technology will be important for future air taxi flights, especially those occurring in cities by tracking aircraft moving through traffic corridors and around landing zones.
Using this data from an experimental air taxi aircraft, NASA will further develop the technology needed to help create safer air taxi flights in high-traffic areas.","NASA engineers began using a network of ground sensors in March to collect data from an experimental air taxi to evaluate how to safely integrate such vehicles into airspace above cities – in all kinds of weather.

Researchers will use the campaign to help improve tools to assist with collision avoidance and landing operations and ensure safe and efficient air taxi operations in various weather conditions.

For years, NASA has looked at how wind shaped by terrain, including buildings in urban areas, can affect new types of aircraft. The latest test, which is gathering data from a Joby Aviation demonstrator aircraft, looks at another kind of wind – that which is generated by the aircraft themselves.

Joby flew its air taxi demonstrator over NASA’s ground sensor array near the agency’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California producing air flow data. The Joby aircraft has six rotors that allow for vertical takeoffs and landings, and tilt to provide lift in flight. Researchers focused on the air pushed by the propellers, which rolls into turbulent, circular patterns of wind.

This rolling wind can affect the aircraft’s performance, especially when it’s close to the ground, as well as others flying in the vicinity and people on the ground. Such wind turbulence is difficult to measure, so NASA enhanced its sensors with a new type of lidar – a system that uses lasers to measure precise distances – and that can map out the shapes of wind features.

“The design of this new type of aircraft, paired with the NASA lidar technology during this study, warrants a better understanding of possible wind and turbulence effects that can influence safe and efficient flights,” said Grady Koch, lead for this research effort, from NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.

Data to Improve Aircraft Tracking

NASA also set up a second array of ground nodes including radar, cameras, and microphones in the same location as the sensors to provide additional data on the aircraft. These nodes will collect tracking data during routine flights for several months.

The agency will use the data gathered from these ground nodes to demonstrate the tracking capabilities and functions of its “distributed sensing” technology, which involves embedding multiple sensors in an area where aircraft are operating.

This technology will be important for future air taxi flights, especially those occurring in cities by tracking aircraft moving through traffic corridors and around landing zones. Distributed sensing has the potential to enhance collision avoidance systems, air traffic management, ground-based landing sensors, and more.

“Our early work on a distributed network of sensors, and through this study, gives us the opportunity to test new technologies that can someday assist in airspace monitoring and collision avoidance above cities,” said George Gorospe, lead for this effort from NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley.

Using this data from an experimental air taxi aircraft, NASA will further develop the technology needed to help create safer air taxi flights in high-traffic areas. Both of these efforts will benefit the companies working to bring air taxis and drones safely into the airspace.

The work is led by NASA’s Transformational Tools and Technologies and Convergent Aeronautics Solutions projects under the Transformative Aeronautics Concepts program in support of NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility mission.

In a joint initiative with the Air Force and Joint Capabilities Group, Army is making regular use of the recently certified fuel.

SAF is a liquid fuel derived from renewable sources. Its use is primarily driven by the need for security of fuel supplies through lower reliance on conventional fuels.

The refuelling at RAAF Base East Sale demonstrated the ADF’s ability to pivot to use the fuel when it is produced domestically in coming years.

All ADF aircraft are certified to use SAF, which is compliant with existing military aviation fuel standards and consistent with standards used by Australia’s allies and partners.

Certified for Defence use in 2023, the Air Force demonstrated the use of SAF with the RAAF Roulettes conducting a flying display fuelled by a SAF blend at the 2023 Newcastle-Williamtown Airshow.

This year Air Force, in collaboration with Joint Capability Group, expanded the initiative to a 12-month pilot activity at RAAF Base East Sale, making the base the first airfield in Australia routinely using a SAF blend.

HQ Aviation Command’s Director of Aviation Capability Management, Colonel Brenton Mellor, said Army’s continuing participation in the initiative ensured its aviators and support personnel understood the strategic significance of SAF and could see how the fuel functioned the same as conventional aviation turbine fuel.

“SAF will be an important element in keeping Army aircraft in the air,” Colonel Mellor said.

“Being able to increase our fuel stocks while maintaining our military capability and interoperability with allies increases our resilience, effectiveness and deterrence.

The meeting brought together the ministers of petroleum, environment, and civil aviation to discuss the project, led by the Egyptian Petrochemicals Holding Company (ECHEM). The initiative is a cornerstone of the petroleum ministry’s strategy to promote sustainable development and reduce environmental impact.

Environment Minister Yasmine Fouad stressed the need for inter-ministerial coordination to accelerate Egypt’s shift toward renewable energy, particularly in aviation—a sector with significant environmental challenges.

She noted that SAF production is crucial for cutting the aviation industry’s carbon emissions. Fouad clarified that carbon credits generated from the project must comply with strict guidelines before being traded. The petroleum ministry has already set emission reduction goals as part of Egypt’s climate commitments and established rules for carbon credit sales.

Fouad also pointed to Egypt’s broader bioeconomy strategy, which encourages biofuel production as a green alternative. Used cooking oil, a primary ingredient for SAF, has been reclassified as a valuable resource following a study by the Waste Management Regulatory Agency.

Tamer Heikal, head of the Egyptian Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (ESAF), outlined the project’s $530 million business plan, confirming that feasibility studies—conducted with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)—are complete.

The facility, to be built on a 100,000-square-meter plot near Dekheila Port, will use advanced technology to convert used cooking oil into 120,000 tons of SAF per year. The fuel will cater to both local and international markets.

Heikal said the project is now in the process of selecting a technology provider and a construction firm, with backing from four global financial institutions. Efforts are also underway to secure long-term supply agreements for used cooking oil and to market the SAF to airlines worldwide.

As the new financial year unfolds, four leaders stand out for their uncanny ability to blend strategy, sustainability, and sheer operational grit. From ambitious fleet expansions to bold turnarounds, these CEOs aren’t just steering planes—they’re redefining an industry.

Jaideep Mirchandani

The Strategic Playmaker at Sky One

When Sky One’s Group Chairman Jaideep Mirchandani submitted his bid to revive GoFirst in mid?2024, it wasn’t just a splashy headline—it was a calculated move to cement India’s place on the global MRO and leasing map. Mirchandani, whose UAE?headquartered Sky One specializes in charters, training, MRO, and asset trading, sees GoFirst as more than just an airline acquisition. He aims to leverage its prized airport slots and traffic rights to build a home?grown aviation services powerhouse.

Building India’s MRO and Training Backbone

At Air Expo Abu Dhabi 2024, Mirchandani unveiled a roadmap focused on sustainability and operational reform. His blueprint calls for scaling pilot training academies, expanding MRO hangars, and rolling out cargo?optimization tech—all designed to support India’s target of 20,000 new pilots by 2030. With women’s empowerment initiatives and green fuel partnerships already underway, Sky One under Mirchandani is charting a new course for the sector.

Vinay Dube

The New?Age Disruptor at Akasa Air

If disruption had a poster child, it would be Akasa Air’s co?founder and CEO Vinay Dube. An Indian?American at the helm of a carrier barely three years old, Dube has guided Akasa from zero to a fleet of 27 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, serving 27 destinations. By July 2025, that fleet will swell to 30 planes—despite earlier delivery delays.

Growth with Grit and Green Fuel

Passenger traffic under Dube’s watch has more than doubled, surging from 7.75 million in March 2024 to a staggering 16 million in March 2025. But growth isn’t Dube’s only metric. With 199 more planes on order, he envisions Akasa as one of the world’s 30 largest airlines by 2030, commanding up to 15% of India’s domestic market. Strategic hubs at Navi Mumbai and Jewar airports will further boost connectivity, while experiments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) demonstrate his commitment to eco?friendly expansion.

Campbell Wilson

The Turnaround Maestro at Air India

When former Scoot and Singapore Airlines veteran Campbell Wilson took charge of Air India in June 2022, he inherited a legacy airline weighed down by aging jets, outdated cabins, and bruised customer sentiment. Fast?forward to 2025, and his blueprint for revival is unmistakable: 250 Airbus and 220 Boeing jets on order, refreshed lounges across New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, and connection times slashed from 10 hours to just three for major transit routes.

Quality over Quantity… for Now

In February 2025, Wilson paused further Boeing orders, citing the need to clear existing backlog before committing to more aircraft—an uncommon move in an era of aggressive procurement. Meanwhile, his team is overhauling cabin interiors, standardizing in?flight entertainment, and rebranding the frequent?flyer program as the ‘Maharaja Club’. While the full payoff of these measures may take years, early indicators—higher on?time performance, rising transit volumes, and positive social?media buzz—suggest Wilson’s “drinking from a firehose” approach is yielding results.

Pieter Elbers

The Global Expansionist at IndiGo

Dutch aviation stalwart Pieter Elbers brought his KLM pedigree to IndiGo in 2022, and the low?cost leader has never looked back. Since his arrival, IndiGo has doubled its international footprint—from 20 overseas destinations to roughly 40 by March 31, 2025—while upping its route count from 60 to 120.

Charting New Horizons with A321XLR

Elbers isn’t stopping at just quantity; he’s targeting quality. With Airbus A321XLRs on the horizon, IndiGo plans to launch up to seven new long?haul routes—and even introduce business?class seating on select high?yield sectors. He envisions another 10 international additions in FY26, mapping out a network that rivals legacy carriers while keeping the “Rising A” ethos of simplicity and reliability intact.

These four CEOs share a common altitude: an unflinching focus on operational excellence coupled with a visionary zeal for growth and sustainability. Whether it’s building India’s MRO backbone, setting new benchmarks in fleet expansion, orchestrating a corporate revival, or weaving a global route tapestry, their collective efforts are not just lifting their airlines—they’re propelling India’s aviation narrative skyward. As FY25 takes flight, passengers, pilots, and the planet all stand to gain from their high?octane leadership.

In an industry already buffeted by global supply chain challenges, a high-stakes game of international tariffs and aircraft allocations is unfolding. As geopolitical tensions shape the aerospace market, Indian carriers could soon find themselves in a fortuitous position, thanks to unexpected shifts in aircraft deliveries stemming from U.S.-China trade sparring.

When Tariffs Alter Flight Routes

The Geopolitical Backdrop

In a dramatic twist, China recently instructed its airlines to halt the acquisition of Boeing aircraft. This move comes on the heels of U.S. tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump, which levied a hefty 145% duty on American-made aircraft. The intent behind these tariffs was to assert economic pressure, but the ripple effects have cascaded well beyond political corridors, directly impacting the global aerospace supply chain.

Shifting the Aircraft Allocation

Chinese airlines, who were expecting deliveries of approximately 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets and 11 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, now find themselves in a logistical limbo. With production slots at the Seattle final assembly line left unused, industry insiders predict that these “white tail” aircraft—originally built for Chinese carriers but not yet delivered—might soon be reallocated to Indian customers.

Indian Carriers at the Ready

A Beneficiary of Redirection

Indian carriers such as Air India Express and the relatively new entrant Akasa Airlines are in a prime position to capitalize on this unforeseen development. Last year, Air India Express acquired 25 white tail Boeing MAX jets, with another 25 jets scheduled for future delivery. The current scenario could allow these airlines to secure even more aircraft—either additional white tails or purpose-built models—to support their expanding fleet, mitigating the persistent challenges of aircraft acquisition amid global constraints.

Learning from History

This isn’t the first time Indian airlines have benefited from redirected aircraft. Recent history has shown similar occurrences, creating a precedent where white tail aircraft, manufactured to cater to specific foreign market demands, end up buoying domestic airline fleets. This not only ensures the continued growth of their services but also bolsters India's position in an increasingly competitive aviation sector.

The Boeing vs. Airbus Dynamic

Boeing's Strategic Dilemma

Boeing is now navigating choppy waters as the shift in aircraft orders creates uncertainty around its global production capacity. With Chinese orders in jeopardy, Boeing’s Seattle final assembly line earmarked for these deliveries risks remaining underutilized. This redirection does little to dent Boeing’s larger operations but signals a broader strategic reevaluation in the wake of volatile global trade policies.

Airbus Seizing the Opportunity

Not to be outdone, Airbus finds itself in a contrasting position. With two final assembly lines dedicated to the popular single-aisle A320 family, Airbus has the capacity to adjust more nimbly to the evolving market conditions. China, which might turn to Airbus for increased aircraft availability, could alter its stance, potentially increasing orders for the European manufacturer—a development that would ripple across the industry as alliances and supply agreements come under reconsideration.

Global Ripple Effects in the Aerospace Industry

A U.S.-Led Trade War in Full Flight

The ongoing tit-for-tat tariffs between the U.S. and China have thrown the global aerospace industry into a state of flux. Planemakers, airlines, and suppliers are reassessing contracts worth billions as they navigate the fine line between honoring delivery commitments and absorbing new costs. The disruption extends to the critical supply chains for parts and equipment. For instance, if China halts the import of U.S. components for its domestic projects like the C919 program, the repercussions could stall or even derail these ventures entirely.

Leasing, Logistics, and Long-Term Strategies

Beyond delivery schedules, the uncertainty has prompted airlines to consider deferring aircraft deliveries rather than accepting additional duties and costs. Beijing is reportedly even brainstorming measures to assist airlines leasing Boeing jets that are now burdened with higher operational costs—a sign that government intervention might be on the horizon as both countries grapple with the fallout.

Conclusion: Turbulence or Opportunity?

As the aerospace industry is drawn deeper into the vortex of global trade disputes, the interplay between tariffs, aircraft allocation, and supply chain disruptions presents both challenges and opportunities. While Boeing might suffer temporary setbacks, Indian carriers stand to gain significantly from redirected aircraft. Meanwhile, Airbus’s robust production capacity may enable it to capture a larger share of the shifting market. With each stakeholder recalibrating its strategy, the skies may indeed be getting a little more crowded—but also a lot more interesting.

In this rapidly evolving high-stakes game, one thing is clear: the next chapter in global aviation will be written not just in the skies, but in the intricate balance of international trade and diplomacy.

In a vibrant twist to the aviation narrative, Akasa Air is charting an ambitious course toward future growth, blending rapid expansion with strategic challenges. With less than three years in operation, the low-cost airline has become a dynamic player in India’s aviation market, doubling its passenger traffic and setting its sights on new heights—even as Boeing delivery delays pose hurdles along the way.

Fleet Expansion: A Bold Vision Takes Flight

Akasa Air is on track to grow its fleet to 30 aircraft, with its 28th Boeing 737 MAX scheduled to join later this month. This expansion is not just about more planes in the sky; it's a commitment to meeting soaring passenger demand. The airline boasts firm orders for 226 aircraft from Boeing, signaling a robust future despite the current delivery setbacks. The ambitious fleet plan underscores the strategic vision of chief executive Vinay Dube and his dedicated team.

Overcoming Challenges: Boeing Delays and Regulatory Hurdles

The journey hasn't been without turbulence. Akasa Air's rapid growth has encountered an unexpected headwind—delivery delays from Boeing. These delays are largely attributed to enhanced regulatory scrutiny following a 2024 incident, where a cabin panel on an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX aircraft blew out mid-flight. This heightened focus on safety has slowed down deliveries, with only around 65 of the 446 Boeing 737 MAX jets ordered by Indian carriers having been delivered to date. Boeing now aims to roll out two aircraft per month, a pace that, while steady, forces Akasa to sometimes ground pilots due to the inconsistency in fleet availability.

Financial Backing and Strategic Investment

In February, the airline secured $135 million in fresh capital—a robust financial boost that reinforces its aggressive expansion plans. The continued support of the Jhunjhunwala family, Akasa Air’s largest shareholder, exemplifies the strong confidence behind the airline’s vision. This investment surge ensures that operational hurdles, from fleet delivery gaps to pilot training interruptions, are met with prompt action and resourceful management.

Strategic Hubs: Navigating to Navi Mumbai and Jewar

Looking ahead, Akasa is gearing up to make a significant mark at two key airports in India—Navi Mumbai and Jewar. By the end of 2025, the carrier plans to station 5–7 aircraft at each location, with both airports expected to become central to its operational strategy. Dube has emphasized that being among the first tenants at these airports isn’t merely a logistical decision; it’s a strategic coup that will help define the airline’s identity in a competitive market. Interestingly, rival Air India Express is reportedly poised to expand its operations at these hubs as well, setting the stage for a dynamic rivalry that could spur further innovation and customer service excellence.

International Expansion: Charting New Global Routes

Beyond domestic success, international growth remains a core strategic pillar for Akasa Air. With flights already connecting 23 cities in India and five international destinations, the airline envisions a network that not only broadens its reach but also significantly boosts its profitability. Chief Executive Vinay Dube reiterates that venturing into international markets is both profitable and crucial for future sustainability. The airline’s rapid increase in passenger numbers—from 7.75 million in March 2024 to an impressive 16 million in March 2025—underscores the effectiveness of its expansion strategy and the burgeoning demand for its services.

A Dynamic Future in the Skies

As Akasa Air navigates the complex interplay between rapid growth and operational challenges, it stands as a testament to innovation in the aviation industry. Its ability to double passenger traffic, secure significant financial investments, and strategically position itself at upcoming major airports paints a picture of a company poised for long-term success. While Boeing delivery delays pose a temporary setback, Akasa’s forward-thinking approach suggests that these hurdles are just minor detours on a well-planned flight path towards industry leadership.

With its daring expansion plans and commitment to overcoming challenges, Akasa Air invites us to wonder: can this trailblazing airline redefine low-cost travel and set new benchmarks in aviation? Time will tell, but one thing is clear—the future of air travel in India is about to get a whole lot more exciting.

With Inputs from Business Standard

India’s largest carrier, IndiGo, is not just weathering global challenges—it’s setting a course for unprecedented growth despite the turbulence from worldwide tariff hikes. In a recent interaction with PTI, Chief Executive Pieter Elbers painted an upbeat picture of a carrier that remains undeterred by global price wars, aiming high in one of the world’s most promising domestic aviation markets. Let’s dive into the dynamic strategic vision that is steering IndiGo toward a horizon brimming with opportunities.

Resilience Amid Global Uncertainty

Navigating Global Tariff Wars

Global tariff hikes have recently sent ripples through international markets, but IndiGo’s management is steering clear of these headwinds. “Some of the more recent dynamics and the global scale are not changing any of our capacity expansion plans for next year,” said Pieter Elbers. The airline’s confidence underscores a deep belief that despite external pressures, strategic, long-term planning can weather even the roughest of economic storms. While acknowledging that a major economy such as India cannot be completely isolated from worldwide events, Elbers emphasizes that a transient “blip” in performance is no match for the robust trajectory set for the future.

Doubling the Fleet, Doubling the Vision

Ambition is at the heart of IndiGo’s strategy. With aspirations to double its size by the end of the decade, the airline is not only focused on maintaining its current market position but also on scaling up to meet both domestic and international challenges head-on. This ambitious roadmap reflects confidence and a commitment to long-term growth, irrespective of short-term market fluctuations.

Capitalizing on India’s Unmatched Domestic Market

The Power of a Big, Untapped Segment

India’s domestic aviation market remains a treasure trove of untapped potential. With thousands of cities and a burgeoning middle class, IndiGo sees a landscape ready to be transformed. Elbers pointedly noted that India’s enormous and competitively priced aviation sector, supported by relatively low average ticket costs, provides a fertile ground for expansion. This market dynamic not only fuels IndiGo’s growth engine but also positions the airline as a key player in bolstering India’s connectivity and economic development.

Competitive Edge in a Consolidating Market

While IndiGo enjoys a leading position, competition is fierce. The aviation duopoly in India, featuring formidable rivals like the Tata group, continues to drive innovation and efficiency. Elbers suggests that a globally competitive, large-scale airline elevates the entire aviation ecosystem in India. This consolidation, observed in various international markets, positions IndiGo at the nexus of increased market efficiency and improved customer service, ultimately benefiting the consumer.

Strategic Innovations and Industry Impacts

The “Missed Opportunity” of Parting Seats

During negotiations with international authorities, parting seats have become a contentious issue. Elbers highlighted that such arrangements represent a missed opportunity for Indian carriers. By sharing seats, foreign competitors often gain an unfair advantage, thereby limiting the growth prospects of domestic airlines. A strategic overhaul in such frameworks could empower IndiGo and its peers, reinforcing the broader narrative of Indian aviation autonomy and self-reliance.

Integration of Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) Capabilities

Beyond flying passengers, IndiGo is also leveraging its robust operational network to extend its services globally. The airline’s practice of sending aircraft overseas for maintenance, repair, and overhaul underscores the employment potential of the aviation sector. With over 60,000 employees today, IndiGo’s growth signifies not just a corporate ambition but a substantial boost to the overall job market and ancillary industries tied to aviation.

Embracing Market Forces for Sustainable Growth

Flexibility in Fare Structures

The conversation around domestic airfares has been a hot topic, with voices calling for regulation. However, Elbers remains firm on trusting market mechanisms, emphasizing that fares adjust naturally with seasonality. Events like the Kumbh Mela may see a surge in costs due to heightened demand, but this dynamic pricing is a testament to the robust, competitive nature of India’s aviation market. Allowing the market to balance supply and demand reinforces IndiGo’s commitment to sustainable growth and consumer-centric policies.

Expanding Through Infrastructure Advancements

Infrastructure development continues to be a cornerstone of IndiGo’s expansion blueprint. With new airports emerging—such as the upcoming facility in Navi Mumbai—the carrier is set to enhance both its operational efficiency and regional connectivity. This dual approach of upgrading existing facilities while venturing into new territories ensures that IndiGo remains at the forefront of India’s aviation revolution.

Conclusion: A Flight Path to the Future

In the rapidly evolving world of aviation, IndiGo is charting an ambitious flight path that balances resilience with innovative growth—even in the face of global tariff-induced challenges.

Any effort to loosen restrictions on U.S. and Russian airlines would increase pressure for similar steps from European carriers.","BRUSSELS — Moscow is lobbying for the U.S. to open its skies to Russian airlines as part of a ceasefire deal with Ukraine.

But there's a big problem with that scheme — the EU isn't keen, and without Europe on board it won't be easy for Russian carriers to fly to the United States.

“First, EU sanctions stand firm against Russia, which includes a ban on Russian airlines flying over EU airspace,” said a European Commission official speaking on condition of anonymity.

Beyond the political decisions on sanctions, the EU official also pointed to “major safety and security issues” related to the possible reopening of EU airspace to Russian jets, as “it is not known if Russian air operators and air traffic services have been properly maintained over the past three years, putting the airworthiness of the Russian fleet seriously in question.”

Since Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russian airlines have been banned from landing in and flying over the territory of the EU and the U.S., as well as from accessing spare parts for aircraft from Western manufacturers such as Boeing or Airbus. The Kremlin retaliated by blocking Western airlines from its airspace.

“As a result, there’s a high probability that bogus parts are being installed in aircraft operating within the Russian domestic market,” said Sander Starreveld, director of the SIG Aviation consultancy, warning of risks to aviation safety. “Allowing these aircraft to operate commercially in Europe is not only unsafe but also risks introducing counterfeit parts into the Union.”

Unsafe skies

In practical terms, reopening Europe's skies to Russian airlines such as flag carrier Aeroflot would also place a massive burden on the EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

The agency would be required to ensure that Russian airplanes have a level of safety that is equivalent with aircraft already operating in the EU, Starreveld said. “This process takes time, especially considering the workload involved.”

In addition to safety and certification issues, many Russian planes may never be able to land in Europe again because they are actually not Russian but were stolen from plane lessors after the invasion.

“Some aircraft could be seized immediately upon landing in Europe due to Russia’s unilateral decision to nationalize leased aircraft,” Starreveld said, noting that “there are massive debts owed to Western leasing companies, and I expect they’ll try to recover as many assets as possible.”

Pressure from Moscow

Despite such problems, Russia is demanding the resumption of direct flights to the U.S. as part of any agreement to stop fighting. Such a step “should be a consequence of the lifting of sanctions on Aeroflot,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on April 11.

“The Americans considered it, [but] so far we have not seen any reciprocal step,” the Russian minister said.

On Wednesday, Russia reportedly asked Washington to be allowed to buy planes built by U.S. manufacturer Boeing and to pay for them with Russian state assets that have been frozen since the start of the war, provided a ceasefire is reached.

So far the Trump administration has not lifted any sanctions on Russia, but some signals are giving the Kremlin hope.

In March, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, Robert Agee, publicly called for the lifting of sanctions in the aviation sector.

“Russia has a huge fleet of Western planes, mostly Boeing. We believe we should provide spare parts and technical support for them, so we will try to have these sanctions lifted,” Agee told the Russian business daily RBC, adding: “This is less a business wish and more of a humanitarian necessity, as ordinary citizens suffer primarily from this.""

Any effort to loosen restrictions on U.S. and Russian airlines would increase pressure for similar steps from European carriers. The latter have long complained about the extra cost of avoiding Russia's vast airspace when flying to Asia, which has given an advantage to Chinese airlines.

Despite these competitive concerns, Brussels is wary of entering into negotiations with Moscow over access to its airspace, in part because of the unsafe nature of Russian skies.

The Commission official called the security of Russian airspace “problematic,” citing the Christmas Day crash of an Azerbaijan Airlines flight — allegedly after being struck by a Russian air defense missile — that prompted EASA to advise airlines to avoid all of western Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized for the crash but stopped short of saying Russia had been responsible.","https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/16/12926648-scaled.jpg",N,,2025-04-18 04:56:35.440032

Marubeni Corporation (hereinafter, “Marubeni”), Japan Airlines Co., Ltd. (hereinafter, “JAL”), Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (hereinafter, “Mitsubishi Chemical”), Chugoku Lumber Co., Ltd. (hereinafter, “Chugoku Lumber”), Boeing Japan KK (hereinafter, “Boeing”) and Obayashi Corporation (hereinafter, “Obayashi”), have concluded a memorandum of understanding on a preliminary business feasibility study for the manufacture and sale of sustainable aviation fuel (hereinafter, “SAF”), bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel from domestic forest residues (hereinafter, the “Pre-Feasibility Study”).

Background and Significance

Japan is among the leading countries in terms of forest resources worldwide, with high expectations that thinning materials and residues generated from wood usage can be leveraged as sustainable raw materials due to their potential volume. In addition, the use of wood in large-scale wooden buildings, including high-rise buildings, is currently in the spotlight from the perspective of resource circulation, and it is expected that there will be an increase in opportunities to utilize the residues generated as a result of such initiatives.

Overview of the Pre-Feasibility Study

This study envisions the potential use of manufacturing technology developed by Licella*1 to produce a bio-intermediate (renewable oil) from wood residues, which will then be reformed and refined for use in making products such as SAF, bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel towards the building of a domestic supply chain. This supply will leverage a model involving local consumption of locally produced products. Specifically, the study will assess the economic viability of the business; consider the raw material supply and processing system as well as the manufacturing process; and evaluate product logistics and effectiveness in reducing CO2 emissions. The study is scheduled to run until December 2025 and aims to commercialize the product around 2030 depending on the progress of the study.

Future prospects

The companies participating in this study will pool their knowledge and expertise towards the realization of the domestic production of sustainable products; the creation of new industries utilizing forest resources throughout Japan; and the promotion of regional revitalization. In addition, by promoting the circulation of forest resources, they will aim to contribute to the resolution of Japan’s forestry challenges, including carbon fixation*2, water resource conservation*3, and disaster prevention.

Last Updated on:

A COMAC C919 rolls to the end of the runway at Shanghai Pudong, a clean-lined aircraft shimmering in the haze as ground crews finish their checks. In the background, a row of pristine Boeing 737 MAX aircraft sit unused, tails high, their future uncertain. The scene is an imagined one, but it’s reflective of reality: China is changing course, and one of the largest aerospace shifts in modern history is underway. Reports indicate that Beijing has instructed its domestic airlines to stop ordering U.S.-built passenger aircraft. The move is not simply an act of retaliation or trade war chess—it’s a signpost for a deeper transformation in industrial strategy, technological sovereignty, and geopolitical signaling.

The gravitational pull of China’s aviation market is well understood by insiders. In 2019, Chinese airlines carried over 660 million passengers, representing more than a trillion revenue passenger kilometers annually. The pandemic cratered that growth curve, but the rebound was swift. Today, passenger-kilometer totals are nearing pre-pandemic levels, with industry expectations of doubling by 2030, although I’m skeptical of that given the continued dominance of high-speed rail and Tencent Meeting (the Chinese alternative to Zoom). When Boeing or Airbus plan production lines, they do so with one eye on Toulouse and Everett, and the other fixed on Beijing.

For decades, China’s air fleets have been filled with Boeing and Airbus metal. The split was once relatively even, with Boeing holding the advantage in narrow-body workhorses and long-haul widebodies alike. ​Over the past decade, Boeing’s relationship with Chinese airlines has experienced a significant decline. Between 2015 and 2020, Boeing delivered 668 aircraft to Chinese customers, reflecting a robust partnership. However, from 2020 through March 2025, deliveries plummeted to just 109 aircraft. This downturn is attributed to a combination of factors, including the global grounding of the 737 MAX following two fatal crashes, escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, and China’s increasing investment in its domestic aerospace industry.

Europe’s Airbus built an assembly line in Tianjin in 2009, deepened its political relationships, and has increasingly become the go-to supplier. Boeing, meanwhile, has seen its position erode not just due to politics but performance—and that matters.

There’s also the emergence of China’s COMAC as a credible manufacturer. The ARJ21 was a slow, clunky, underperforming regional jet built with dated technology and endless delays. But it served its purpose as a systems integration testbed, and it taught COMAC and its suppliers how to build, certify, and support a commercial airliner. That experience paved the way for the C919, China’s first real attempt at challenging the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 head-on. The aircraft uses modern avionics and Western engines, but it is designed, assembled, and delivered under Chinese control. More importantly, it’s being pushed into the fleet not as a speculative startup venture, but with the full weight of the Chinese state behind it.

At the same time, Boeing has been disassembling the institutional knowledge and engineering culture that once made it the world’s most respected airplane manufacturer. Its embrace of the Jack Welch school of quarterly capitalism from General Electric—cutting R&D, gutting engineering oversight, offshoring everything it could, prioritizing stock buybacks—has been well documented. The 737 MAX crisis wasn’t a one-off error. It was a systemic failure, the inevitable result of decades of eroding technical competence in favor of financial optimization. I have written about the substitution of engineers with finance MBAs, the rise of offshoring for supplier risk dilution rather than integration quality, and the near-total loss of executive leadership that understood the physics of flight. Boeing didn’t lose China. It gave it away.

There’s more. While Airbus capitalized on the vacuum, delivering hundreds of A320neo-family jets and securing long-term relationships, China has been working toward something even more consequential: not just supplier diversification, but supplier replacement. The orders for 300 C919s by China’s Big Three airlines are not just a vote of confidence—they are a domestic industrial policy in action. COMAC is ramping production capacity to 150–200 units per year by the end of the decade. That’s a credible share of China’s expected single-aisle fleet expansion, and a strategic firewall against geopolitical shocks. China doesn’t want to be held hostage to U.S. export policy or EU regulatory leverage. It wants to own the full stack of its own aviation future. And as a reminder, turbine metals are mostly processed in China, and it’s just put export licenses on them targeted at the USA and hence Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

The implications go far beyond fleet planning. The global aerospace sector relies on tight regulatory harmonization, overlapping supply chains, and decades of accumulated interoperability. COMAC’s current products use CFM engines and Western avionics, but the trend is toward domestic substitution where possible. In parallel, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) is working to establish its own certification regime that will rival the FAA or EASA—not just for internal purposes, but for export into Belt and Road countries with aligned regulatory standards. This is how parallel systems emerge: not through confrontation, but through quiet, persistent divergence.

And here’s the part that too few in Washington or Chicago seem to grasp: this isn’t a tantrum. It’s a transition. China is not rejecting Boeing as a company. It’s rejecting a model—a model of industrial dependency, of outsourced accountability, of financialized engineering. Airbus should not be resting easy. It may be the preferred Western supplier today, but its future status is conditional. COMAC’s widebody program, the CR929, has been bumpy, especially after Russia’s withdrawal. But the ambition remains. China is not interested in winning on price alone. It wants the prestige, leverage, and supply chain sovereignty that come from fielding a full domestic aviation stack.

This realignment isn’t purely about China either. It sends shockwaves through the entire global aviation system. Boeing’s declining relevance in the world’s most important growth market puts its long-term production planning at risk. Suppliers who depend on Boeing for orders are being squeezed. And smaller states that used to play Boeing and Airbus off one another may soon find they have a third axis in COMAC—one that comes with financing, infrastructure packages, and political ties. India, Turkey, and other regional powers are watching closely. Aviation is one of the last high-tech sectors with massive barriers to entry. China is demonstrating how to scale those walls.

And Trump’s tariffs hit Boeing hard. The 25% markup on imported aluminum, so essential to airframes, when the USA imports most of their supply of the metal, means Boeing is both losing customers and seeing increasing costs. This isn’t a good combination from a survival perspective.

In late 2024, China’s Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC) granted type certification to the RX4E, a four-seat electric aircraft developed by the Liaoning General Aviation Academy. This marked the first time an electric aircraft received such certification under China’s CCAR-23 regulations, which govern airworthiness for normal category aircraft. In fact, it’s the first commercial electric airplane certified to carry passengers globally. The RX4E, powered by a 70 kWh lithium battery and capable of a 1.5-hour flight time, is designed for applications like pilot training, sightseeing, and aerial photography. This certification signifies China’s commitment to advancing electric aviation technology and integrating it into its broader transportation infrastructure. China has also certified an evtol from eHang for passenger flights, which while mostly a dead end flex, is still more than the west has done. It’s also rapidly expanding production of sustainable aviation fuel.

All of this raises hard questions for the United States. The pivot to quarterly earnings as the primary metric of corporate health has gutted its industrial base across sectors, from semiconductors to power transformers to commercial aircraft. Boeing could have remained a globally dominant aerospace manufacturer, but instead financially engineered its way to failing aircraft and exclusion from the biggest growing market in the world. Meanwhile, China built plants, trained engineers, certified aircraft, and now fields its own jets, while keeping most of its citizens on the ground in low-carbon, high-speed rail. It’s a lesson in what happens when a nation-state takes industry, climate change and transportation seriously.

The future of aviation is becoming multipolar. Boeing, once a synonym for safe, efficient, and globally interoperable air travel, is now a full stop in one of the most critical markets on Earth and a question mark elsewhere. Airbus is the near-term winner, but it plays under the long shadow of strategic substitution. COMAC isn’t ready to compete globally yet—but it doesn’t have to. It only has to dominate at home, and in doing so, redefine what the next era of aviation looks like.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ChatGPT-Image-Apr-17-2025-09_17_34-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-04-18 04:56:44.783329

In 1980, the United States accounted for 44% of global wheat exports; today that total is just 11%. Over the last five years, the US corn export market share has fallen to a record-low 31%, down from a high of above 80% in the 1970s. Once the leader in soybean exports, the United States has watched Brazil supplant it; it now accounts for only 27% of soybean shipments compared to 80% five decades ago.

And now, amid another trade war with China, the world’s largest soybean importer, and other countries that import US ag products, that downward spiral may continue.

In March, US President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, his social-media platform, that US agricultural producers should prepare to “start making a lot of agricultural products to be sold INSIDE of the United States.”

Sounds simple enough, but it flies in the face of reality. The United States currently exports about 25% of the grain it produces each year, including more than half of its soybeans. Even with domestic industrial uses of grain steadily climbing in recent years, the percentage of bulk ag commodities (corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, sorghum, pulses and cotton) shipped overseas has been trending higher, including a 22% increase last year, the biggest year-on-year increase in more than a decade.

Finding additional domestic demand drivers for grains and oilseeds is possible, perhaps with increased biofuel use such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel or some other industrial use that has yet to be discovered. But even in a best-case scenario, it takes years for these new markets to develop.

One of the long-term impacts of trade wars, even after they end, is a loss of reputation as a reliable supplier on the global market, something that can take years to repair. Countries that have no choice but to rely on grain imports to feed their people not only consider cost and quality, but they also want stable trading partners that deliver products in a consistent manner year by year, without disruption.

It took the United States a long time to be viewed as a reliable supplier following grain embargoes in the 1970s and 80s. The same thing has happened with soybean exports following the US-China trade war from 2018 to 2020, as China has shifted to Brazil as its primary soybean supplier.

The recent trade wars have not only fueled more conflict and mistrust between the world’s two major economic powers, but relationships between the United States and its allies like the European Union, Canada and Mexico have been strained by Trump’s freewheeling tariff policies.

Once the dust settles in this latest trade war, perhaps another era of free trade will begin. Until then, with tariffs and counter-tariffs flying back and forth between countries, what we’re witnessing is a race to the bottom with mostly losers and very few winners.",https://www.petfoodprocessing.net/ext/resources/Articles/2025/04April/041725_Trade-war-impacting-Ag_Lead.jpg?height=635&t=1744891277&width=1200,N,,2025-04-18 07:56:14.417392

The agency, also known as Massport, announced the hiring of Jill Valdes Horwood, who has worked for the Barr Foundation, a grant-making private foundation, and advocacy group Boston Harbor Now, as the new chief. The job includes helping the agency get to its goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2031, the same year Massport turns 75.

“Jill brings a strong track record in climate policy and advocacy that will be critical as we continue our Net Zero initiatives and prepare for the long-term impacts of climate change,” Rich Davey, Massport’s CEO, said in a statement.

At the Barr Foundation, Horwood worked as director of its Boston Waterfront Initiative, which focused on promoting access and development focused climate resilience. She served as Boston Harbor Now’s director of policy, and she previously has done legal work for victims of domestic violence and underserved populations.

Aside from Logan Airport, Massport’s portfolio of facilities includes Worcester Regional Airport; Hanscom, an airfield 20 miles northwest of Boston; the Port of Boston’s Conley Terminal serving container ships; and the Flynn Cruiseport, which serves cruise ships.

Massport’s emissions come from a central heating plant, cargo handling equipment, its maritime facilities, emergency generators, and snow melters, among other machinery. But the largest generator of emissions is aviation fuel.

“Ninety percent of greenhouse gas emissions at Logan Airport come from aviation fuels,” Davey said during a recent talk to members of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts (AIM) at a local law firm. Overall, aviation fuel accounts for two to three percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to Davey.

“We’re doing all the things you would expect a manager of facilities to do. We’re changing our light bulbs, we’re buying electric vehicles, we’re putting in charging plug-ins for customers. We’re doing all that,” he said. “But still, we take care all of that, it’s only a 10 percent reduction of our own greenhouse gas emissions. So sustainable aviation fuel is still reasonably new and there are some promising technologies. We’ll see how far off they are.”

Massport is interested in helping the technology along. “We’re really focused on how we can scale it, how we can get some adoption going, at Hanscom for example, or at Worcester or Logan,” Davey said. “It’s exciting to be at the forefront of that question.”",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Transportation_Logan-Airport_Plane_Sunset.png,N,,2025-04-17 20:57:06.301742

Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) has received a Level 4 accreditation in the Airports Council International (ACI) Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) program, the second-highest level awarded by ACI. “Level 4 recognizes an airport for measuring carbon emissions from both an airport authority and third parties operating on site, and for demonstrating emissions reduction progress,” said Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), which runs LAX. LAX achieved Level 3 accreditation in 2017. “In 2023, a 26% reduction of [non-aeronautical] energy consumption per passenger at LAX from 2011 levels was achieved, two years ahead of LAWA's 2025 goal,” LAWA noted. Airports in the ACI APA program can ultimately achieve as high as a Level 5 accreditation, which means the airport has “reached net zero for emissions under their control and committed to full decarbonization across all scopes by 2050,” according to ACI.

Casablanca Mohammed V International Airport plans to build a new $1.5 billion passenger terminal. The facility—described by the National Airports Office of Morocco as a “hub-style terminal” aimed at facilitating connectivity—will have capacity to handle 20 million passengers annually. The project is targeted for a 2029 completion.

Hong Kong International Airport (HKG) was the busiest cargo airport in the world in 2024, according to Airports Council International World (ACI). HKG handled 4.9 million metric tons of cargo in 2024, up 14.1% year-over-year. ACI noted that combined volumes at the top 10 busiest cargo airports in the world in 2024—representing nearly 26% of global volumes—rose 9.3% year-over-year to 32.3 million metric tons. “The increase in cargo is attributed mainly to strong e-commerce demand, maritime shipping disruptions and declines in jet fuel price,” ACI said. Shanghai Pudong International Airport (3.8 million metric tons, up 9.8% over 2023) and FedEx base hub Memphis International Airport (3.7 million metric tons, down 3.3%) were the second- and third-busiest cargo airports in the world, respectively, in 2024, according to ACI. Four through 10 on the ACI busiest cargo airports list for 2024 were: Anchorage, UPS Airlines base hub Louisville, Seoul Incheon, Miami, Doha, Guangzhou and Taipei. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport remained the busiest passenger airport in the world in 2024.

New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL) will roll out trials of four full body scanners at security checkpoints in May. “These advanced scanners detect both metallic and non-metallic threats, including explosives, significantly improving upon traditional metal detectors,” DEL said. “The technology … enables rapid screening, with each scan taking just three seconds and a maximum throughput of 1,200 scans per hour, dramatically improving efficiency while minimizing passenger inconvenience.” The scanners generate a 2D image on a preset human avatar and images are not stored, DEL noted. The machines have already been installed—two in DELs Terminal 1 and two in Terminal 3. DEL said the trial of the four scanners will last 3-4 months, after which a committee will evaluate the findings and determine whether and how a full-scale implementation could be put in place. The airport noted similar scanners are being used at some major airports around the world, including in Australia and the U.S. DEL CEO Videh Kumar Jaipuriar said the machines are “a game-changer in security screening, allowing for faster and more effective checks without compromising privacy.”",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-04-17 12:57:09.336764

India boasts one of the youngest aircraft fleets globally. Nearly 59% of commercial aircraft in operation today belong to the latest generation of narrowbody and regional jets. This number is expected to rise to an impressive 95% by 2041. Airlines like IndiGo, Akasa Air, Air India Express, and SpiceJet are investing heavily in fuel-efficient aircraft such as the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX to reduce fuel burn and emissions per seat.

Fleet renewal, however, is just the beginning. The real test will be compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which India is set to formally join in 2027. CORSIA requires airlines to purchase offsets for emissions above 2020 levels on international routes, effectively placing a price on carbon-heavy operations.

While CORSIA is a global step toward aviation decarbonization, its rollout raises tough questions: Who will pay for greener flying? And how will Indian carriers remain cost-competitive while absorbing higher operational costs? Answering such tough questions on carbon emissions airline leaders pooled together their thoughts at recently held India Travel & Tourism Sustainability Conclave 2025. Speaking on Air India Express’ objectives Aloke Singh, managing director, Air India Express said: “We have started a green flight program to optimize fuel consumption and reduce emissions.” But Singh also emphasized the need for robust planning: “It is vital to involve finance teams early to understand the cost implications of CORSIA compliance,” he added.

This concern over cost is echoed across the industry. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), seen as a key enabler of low-carbon flight, currently costs five times more than traditional jet fuel, a pricing mismatch that makes large-scale adoption challenging without subsidies or policy incentives. In spite of this, industry leaders are optimistic. Aditya Ghosh, Co-Founder of Akasa Air and former President of IndiGo, believes India can play a pivotal role in reshaping the economics of green aviation: “India can play a leading role with respect to sustainable aviation fuel by plugging into the global supply chain opportunities.” However, he warned of a growing financial gap, adding: “There is a funding gap of around $350 million between traditional aviation fuel and a 10% SAF blend.”

This gap poses a serious question for airlines: Should passengers absorb this cost through ticket prices, or will governments and fuel producers step in to help bridge it? So, what does aviation need? The answer lies in Tech-Led innovation and policy reform.

Beyond SAF, Indian airlines are also investing in data-driven efficiencies and emerging aircraft technologies to reduce carbon intensity. Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director of SpiceJet, offered a forward-looking perspective: “We need to use technology advances like artificial intelligence and machine learning to find new ways to burn fewer fossil fuels. We need to aggressively pursue the development of electric aircraft for our future flying needs.” He further urged the government to foster a more supportive ecosystem: “India needs to reduce taxes on aviation turbine fuel and improve the business environment to make the sector globally competitive.”

These structural reforms, combined with strategic partnerships, could position India as both a hub for sustainable aviation and a leading voice in shaping equitable global climate policy.

As India’s aviation market is projected to become the world’s third-largest by 2030, the country has a unique opportunity to demonstrate how rapid growth can coexist with environmental responsibility. The transition won’t be easy: high fuel prices, regulatory compliance, and supply chain hurdles for SAF and offsets will require shared responsibility across the aviation value chain.

But with forward-thinking leadership, fleet investments, and a collaborative approach to sustainability, Indian aviation could become a case study in how to scale responsibly lifting passengers and carbon standards at the same time.",https://english.mathrubhumi.com/image/contentid/policy:1.10329823:1740314637/flight.jpg?$p=c600d7d&f=16x9&w=1080&q=0.8,N,,2025-04-17 14:56:41.401124

Problems at the facility have caused toxic chemical releases and a record air quality fine.

Its closure would mean Benicia would lose millions of dollars a year and hundreds of jobs.

It could also mean the price you pay for gas may rise dramatically.

RELATED: Valero may close Benicia refinery by next year, citing CA regulations and high costs

Valero has submitted notice to the California Energy Commission of its current intent to ""idle, restructure, or cease refining operations"" at the Benicia Refinery, drawing strong reactions across the state. UC Berkeley's Severin Borenstein is an expert in this field and has testified in front of lawmakers on refinery matters.

""It's quite disturbing that the refinery produces about 9% of the gasoline in California,"" Borenstein said.

According to a statement from the company, the refinery is seeking closure because of the high costs and strict environmental regulations in California.

""Certainly, one has to wonder how much this is a negotiating stance because they have recently seen a lot of pressure from the city of Benicia to change their operations,"" Borenstein said.

Denton Cinquegrana, the chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service, gave his perspective on the future of the refinery.

""Closing the refinery is one of the options; they could also decide to reconfigure it to make it a facility to make something like renewable diesel or sustainable aviation fuel,"" he said.

The real question here is if this refinery closes, will California gas prices rise?

""So yeah, it's gonna be a tight-rope and has the potential to swing prices potentially higher,"" Cinquegrana said.

Borenstein and Cinquegrana both point to the closure of the Phillips 66 Refinery in Southern California. They say that with another possible closure, the state must plan to import more gas to keep prices from rising too drastically.

""We just need to do it in a way that's not going to disrupt the supply-demand balance,"" Borenstein said. ""If we lose too many refineries too quickly, we're going to end up with a shortage, but we could very well see a 25 to 30 cent increase as a possibility.""

""The refinery is not scheduled to close for another year, so a lot can change in another year,"" Cinquegrana said.

There is a hope that the state and company work together on the matter, so drivers aren't impacted too much at the pump come next year.

Valery released this statement from Chairman, CEO and President Lane Riggs:

""Valero Energy Corporation announced today that its subsidiary, Valero Refining Company-California, has submitted notice to the California Energy Commission of its current intent to idle, restructure, or cease refining operations at Valero's Benicia Refinery by the end of April 2026.

Kim Reynolds announced she will not seek reelection for another term after nearly a decade as the 43rd governor of Iowa. Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA) members sincerely thank Gov. Reynolds for her many years of leadership, especially for her success in advancing Iowa agriculture and renewable fuels.

“Today is a bittersweet day,” said IRFA Executive Director Monte Shaw. “While IRFA members are disappointed Gov. Kim Reynolds won’t be running for reelection, we have very fond memories of her many accomplishments. The Governor has been a tireless advocate for growing the state’s renewable fuels industry, championing nation-leading public policy that always pushes the needle.

Reynolds for her outstanding leadership in ensuring Iowa agriculture continues to feed and fuel the world today and long into the future.”

In her decade as Iowa’s chief executive, Gov. Reynolds led efforts to:

Establish the nation’s first E15 Access Standard, ensuring Iowa consumers have access to E15 which usually costs 15-20 cents less per gallon.

Create the nation’s first ever B20 and B30 retailer tax credits to maximize the use of biodiesel in Iowa.

Secure new regulations for 8 Midwest states from the U.S. EPA that allow E15 to be sold year-round.

Appropriate record funding for Iowa’s nation-leading Renewable Fuels Infrastructure Program (RFIP), a public-private cost-share program to help Iowa retailers install the equipment necessary to offer higher blends of ethanol and biodiesel to consumers.

Enact a first-of-its-kind E40 future proofing standard for Iowa fuel dispensing equipment, ensuring Iowa retailers will be ready when higher blends enter the marketplace. As a result, the two largest fuel pump manufacturers (representing over 90% of the market) have made E40 compatibility their base offering from coast-to-coast.

Shift Iowa’s renewable fuel tax differentials from low blends to E15 and B20 or higher blends, thereby increasing funds for Iowa’s roads and bridges while also driving greater renewable fuel sales.

Protect the federal renewable fuel standard (RFS) blending levels to grow demand for Iowa corn, soybeans and animal fats.

“I suppose some would mention Gov. Reynolds’ time as a high school cheerleader in an effort to undercut her,” added Shaw. “But I was always impressed with her inherit confidence. Rather than shy away from that, she leaned in. She knew who she was; she was Iowa’s cheerleader. She was the best cheerleader for Iowa farmers and renewable fuels producers you could ever hope for.

An old plane for a greener future

The original idea was to rehabilitate a light and reliable aircraft, suitable for an aeroclub's needs, while making it sustainable and environmentally friendly. This is how the Phoenix project was born. The team recently received the plane, a Jodel D119, a two-seat taildragger aircraft dating from 1958. It is a homebuilt aircraft, maintained by its previous pilot, accumulating about 2,000 flight hours. The purchase of the aircraft was made possible thanks to a $60,000 donation from the Howmet Aerospace Foundation. The original gasoline engine will be replaced by a Citroën C4 Picasso Diesel engine, modified to use SAF, a more ecological alternative to the typical fuel used for light aviation, Avgas 100LL.

Mathis Blanchard, co-leader of the project, explains: ""The challenge today for aviation is learning to fly cleanly. Through this project, we are exploring solutions on our scale.""

The project aims to meet the local demand expected for this type of green fuel over the next few years. It also opens new horizons for export to foreign markets, capitalizing on the growing global demand, especially with the petroleum sector having the technical and logistical components needed for success.

Notably, the project is part of a broader package of green initiatives adopted by the ministry through ECHEM to provide green, environmentally friendly products and reduce carbon emissions.

Badawi said that the meeting reinforces the ministries’ joint efforts and demonstrates the government’s keenness on executing projects with significant economic and environmental value.

For her part, Minister Fouad said that this cooperation for SAF reflects the state’s commitment to a seamless transition toward a green economy. She added that in coordination with the Ministries of Petroleum and Civil Aviation, her ministry is working to develop a clear roadmap that supports this project, with stimulating investments and building partnerships with the private sector as its main pillars. She noted that this type of biofuel is a clean, safe alternative that meets international environmental standards.

She pointed out that selling or trading carbon certificates is not permitted except in accordance with specific controls and standards. Moreover, the Ministry of Petroleum has set emission reduction rates within the national contributions plan for several high-priority projects.

Discussing waste management, Fouad said that it is an area with plenty of green incentives and privileges available for investors under the investment law. Four areas where opportunities for effective private sector participation in investment are especially vast are: green hydrogen, electric transportation, waste management, and alternatives to single-use plastic bags.

Fouad revealed that the Waste Management Regulatory Agency will soon present a business model for using biofuel production inputs from used cooking oils, agricultural waste, and other sources. The model will determine economic feasibility and cost to ensure the sustainability of the field, and its long-term ability to attract investments, she said.

For his part, Minister El-Hefny underlined the importance of localizing SAF production in Egypt following international standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

He added that establishing the Egyptian Sustainable Aviation Fuel (ESAF) Company is a major milestone in the journey towards leading this promising industry in Africa.

El-Hefny praised the pivotal role played by the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources with its advanced expertise in the fields of refining and energy. It is greatly contributing to supporting local and international high-quality production. He also said that a comprehensive feasibility study is crucial. It should include technical, economic, and operational aspects, and be approved by the concerned authorities.

Equally important is the development of effective logistical mechanisms to ensure the efficiency of the supply and distribution chain, both within Egyptian airports and internationally. This would guarantee high performance and sustainability.

During the meeting, Chairman of ECHEM, Ibrahim Mekki, noted that ESAF, a first-of-its-kind project in Africa and the Middle East, relies on a modern, internationally-approved technology to produce SAF from used cooking oil.

He noted that creating a joint follow-up team from the three concerned ministries is a catalyst for the project’s implementation and the maximization of its economic and environmental returns.

During the meeting, Tamer Heakal, Chairman of ESAF, reviewed the project’s business plan, objectives, and implementation procedures.

ESAF, a $530 million investment project, is expected to produce 120,000 tons of SAF annually, utilizing advanced hydrotreatment technologies for conversion. Production is planned to meet local demand and support exports to global markets. The project spans an area of 100,000 square meters near the Dekheila Port, Heakal noted.

He revealed that selecting a manufacturing license and an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor is still in progress. Additionally, the selection process of international financing agencies is underway and is seeing notable progress. Similarly, efforts to market the project’s output to global companies and secure input from used cooking oil are advancing steadily, according to Haekal.

He concluded by further reviewing the necessary support to accelerate the project and yield the highest profits possible through the combined efforts of the Ministries of Environment and Civil Aviation.",https://egyptoil-gas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/490674920_986254943689477_2330941780082433607_n-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-17 11:58:15.262514

But with the challenges of geopolitics, ever-changing regulations, and the need to adapt to disruptions, supply chain leaders are rethinking operations on many levels.

At Microsoft, prioritizing sustainable practices with suppliers has also helped us uncover new opportunities for innovation and cost optimization.

Our new guide, Reduce Risk, Create Resilience: Advancing Supply Chain Sustainability, outlines how data intelligence and collaboration can transform supply chains to be more agile, sustainable, and resilient. We offer lessons from our own experience as we strive to meet our ambitions to be carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030, all while protecting ecosystems. And we provide actionable insights and practical steps to help customers address reporting pressures, mitigate risks, and seize opportunities for innovation, ultimately driving resilience and long-term value.

Aligning data and systems for the road ahead

Organizations are facing growing regulations and customer expectations to prioritize sustainable practices. To make meaningful change, organizations and their suppliers must share data and work together to address challenges across the ecosystem.

Advanced analytics and AI are transforming supply chain sustainability at Microsoft. By leveraging these technologies, we accelerate day-to-day work, gain real-time insights, and drive co-innovation to meet sustainability reporting requirements as well as business continuity needs.

For instance, our procurement team used Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability to centralize supplier emissions data and streamline processes. By integrating AI-powered automation, such as automated review of supplier assurance letters, we reduced survey processing time by 92%.

Eckes-Granini, a European producer of name-brand fruit juices, is committed to ensuring that all its raw ingredients are sustainably sourced by 2030. The company used Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform including Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Power BI to connect to essential data sources and create precise visualizations of suppliers’ progress. This enables Eckes-Granini to track risks and follow up with suppliers accordingly. Now almost 70% of Eckes-Granini’s juice ingredients meet sustainability standards, and the company is better prepared to respond to Germany’s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act.

Choosing carbon-free electricity solutions

Carbon-free electricity (CFE), such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, can be a powerful lever for decarbonization, helping companies achieve up to 50% of their decarbonization goals through improved fuel efficiency and reduce exposure to varying fuel prices.1 2 Organizations can help scale the benefits of CFE in supply chains by launching supplier enablement programs.

To help meet our own carbon reduction targets, Microsoft now requires suppliers to transition to 100% carbon-free electricity for the goods and services delivered to Microsoft by 2030. We’re making this easier for suppliers through our Supplier REach Portal, co-created with 3Degrees, to streamline access and procurement of CFE; and Zettawatts’ Supplier CFE Program, to provide assistance for reaching our CFE requirement, from understanding CFE procurement to discussing goals, developing plans and budgets, and reviewing agreements.

Turkish energy company Enerjisa Üretim established a round-the-clock remote operation center that receives more than 50,000 signals per second from its large network of hydropower, wind, and solar plants. It processes the data using an Azure-based solution including Azure IoT Hub, Azure Digital Twins, and Azure Machine Learning. The solution delivers real-time monitoring and data analytics on power plant performance—all in one centralized location. It also uses Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service to forecast future outcomes, predicting average daily production for turbines for up to two months.

Creating new value from resource optimization

The World Economic Forum estimates that adopting circular business models could unlock up to USD4.5 trillion in value by 2030.3 By adopting circularity, companies can not only help meet regulatory requirements but also drive new innovation, enhance their brand reputation, and differentiate their business.

With a focus on the long-term value of resources, companies can uncover ways to reduce environmental impact while also increasing value for the business. Supply chains are central to this opportunity.

To help meet our goal of becoming a zero waste company by 2030, Microsoft set a target of reusing or recycling 90% of our cloud hardware by 2025. We not only reached that target a year early—we exceeded it. In 2024, we reached a 90.9% reuse and recycling rate of our cloud servers and components.

Within our global datacenters, Microsoft Circular Centers are foundational to this work, enabling us to process and route decommissioned servers and hardware components to their next useful lives, such as internal reuse, other electronic supply chains, or academies that train datacenter technicians.

Reinventing supply chain logistics

Supply chain logistics challenges are bigger than any one company. To meet growing regulatory and market pressures, organizations need to leverage data and AI technology across their ecosystems and industries. Sharing data at a more granular level, they can identify opportunities to improve infrastructure and boost sustainability across whole logistics networks.

Applying this principle, Microsoft has moved our cloud supply chain to renewable diesel in our road freight operations in Europe and California while keeping existing equipment in use.

We’re also advancing aviation decarbonization by integrating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into shipments of cloud hardware. Through multi-year agreements, we’re working to reduce air freight emissions and help scale the adoption of SAF across the industry.3

Results so far include:

50% lower emissions for road freight operations in Europe and California, using renewable diesel.

17,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (mtCO2e) saved through SAF, compared to conventional transportation fuels.

73% lower relative carbon intensity of our cloud logistics supply chain since 2022 through lower-carbon transportation and logistics consolidation.

(Jet Zero) has moved into the front-end engineering and design (FEED) phase for its planned Project Ulysses, a grassroots development involving construction of a renewable fuels plant in the Townsville State Development Area of North Queensland, Australia (OGJ Online, Dec. 23, 2024).

Following preliminary agreements in December 2024, Jet Zero in April finalized award of a contract to Technip Energies (T.EN) for delivery of FEED services on the project that, if completed, will be equipped to produce 102 million l./year of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and 11 million l./year of renewable diesel from a feedstock of Australian bioethanol, Jet Zero and T.EN said in separate releases.

T.EN’s scope of work under the contract covers an extensive package of engineering activities, documentation, and planning, all aimed at refining a cost estimate and detailed timelines for the project, the service provider said on Apr. 16.

Alongside the FEED contract award, Jet Zero also confirmed continuance of an engineering services contract with Melbourne-based Long Energy and Resources (Aust) Pty. Ltd. (LERA), which will provide specialist project management and owner engineering services to assure FEED engineering is delivered to Jet Zero’s design philosophy and in compliance with the FEED contract.

Award of the T.EN and LERA contracts—each of which are anticipated to run for several months—to complete Project Ulysses’ estimated $36.8-million (Aus.; $22.1-million) FEED program was made possible through crucial funding support from Jet Zero’s investors and industry partners, the operator said.

External partners supporting the project include aviation affiliates Airbus SE and Qantas Airways Ltd., as well as Japanese petroleum producer and refiner Idemitsu Kosan Co. Ltd.

Financial support for Project Ulysses also came from the government of Australia via Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) Advancing Renewables Program and the Queensland government’s Department of State Development, Infrastructure and Planning, which together awarded Jet Zero a combined $14 million (Aus.) in late 2024 to help take project development through the FEED stage into final investment decision (FID), Jet Zero said in a release dated Oct. 9, 2024.

Additional project details

Slated to become Australia’s first alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) low-carbon liquid fuels production (LCLF) plant by its targeted startup in late 2027 or early 2028, Project Ulysses will use LanzaJet Inc.’s proprietary ATJ technology that incorporates T.EN’s patented Hummingbird technology for converting a feedstock of Australian bioethanol to ethylene, the latter of which will subsequently be transformed—using LanzaJet’s oligomerization and hydrogenation technology—into SAF and renewable diesel, according to Jet Zero and ARENA.

An official project description from ARENA indicated the FEED study for Project Ulysses is due for completion by Jan. 1, 2026.

In Minnesota, carbon emissions from power generation fell 52% between 2005 and 2024 as cheaper, lower-emitting sources edged coal off the grid, according to CEEM’s 2025 energy factsheet.
Minnesota is 10th in the nation for “overall energy efficiency,” according to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.
And while it’s not yet clear whether it’s a blip or part of a longer-term trend, Minnesota’s wind power industry stalled out last year.
Flakoll said wind power has several factors working against it right now.","Minnesota’s electric grid is cleaner than ever, and the state is well positioned to take advantage of emerging energy industries, Clean Energy Economy Minnesota said Thursday.

But federal policy chaos — driven by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and general preference for fossil fuels — as well as shifting consumer behavior and lagging implementation of environmentally friendly technologies hint at bigger challenges ahead for one of the fastest-growing sectors of the state’s economy, analysts and industry representatives said at a Monday press briefing.

“Certainly there’s a lot going on right now…that makes predicting the future and [even] predicting today a little bit unsteady,” said Becky Wacker, director of energy services sales in North America for Trane Technologies.

The U.S. power sector saw a “dramatic transformation” in recent years thanks to falling costs for wind and solar power, state clean energy policies and long-term clean power purchase commitments by tech giants like Amazon and Google, said Derrick Flakoll, Bloomberg NEF senior policy associate. In Minnesota, carbon emissions from power generation fell 52% between 2005 and 2024 as cheaper, lower-emitting sources edged coal off the grid, according to CEEM’s 2025 energy factsheet.

More recently, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 spurred investment in nascent clean-tech industries like low-emissions hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, which airlines and jet manufacturers see as key to their long-term sustainability goals. CEEM’s factsheet touted the Minnesota Sustainable Aviation Fuel Tax Credit, which pays $1.50 per gallon of sustainable aviation fuel produced and sold in Minnesota through June 2030, and a biofuels startup’s plan to build a $5 billion sustainable aviation fuel plant in Moorhead that could eventually produce nearly 200 million gallons of fuel each year.

These investments “now face significant market risk” due to the Trump administration’s hefty — and self-contradictory — import tariffs, and the very real possibility that Congress narrows or repeals key IRA tax credits later this year.

“The fate of this is hanging in the balance (due to) a lot of political and economic factors,” Flakoll said.

State-level policy looks steadier in the near term, Wacker said. That could be a silver lining for HVAC and refrigeration businesses like Trane, which has rebranded itself as a leader in building efficiency and decarbonization.

“A number of states are staying pretty consistent in how they’re approaching things,” she said.

Minnesota is 10th in the nation for “overall energy efficiency,” according to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy. A 2021 law that boosted utility-led efficiency programs saved residents and businesses more than $307 million over two years, CEEM said.

But Minnesota’s ambitious efficiency and sustainability policies haven’t translated into action to the extent seen in nation-leading states and cities, Wacker said. She nodded to Washington state, which will begin holding larger buildings to strict sustainability standards next year; and New York City, where Local Law 97 encourages landlords to swap out creaky boilers for efficient heat pumps.

On electric vehicle uptake, Minnesota lags the national trendline. New registrations fell 44% from 2023 to 2024, slipping below 10,000, as EV sales grew 6.5% nationally, CEEM found. Minnesota had 65,679 plug-in EVs on its roads in November 2024, according to CEEM — less than 2% of total light-duty vehicle registrations. Plug-in vehicles accounted for 1 in 4 vehicle registrations last year in California, the top U.S. EV market, though the total share of EV registrations there remains far lower.

And while it’s not yet clear whether it’s a blip or part of a longer-term trend, Minnesota’s wind power industry stalled out last year.

“That’s a little different from past years, when we had a combination of wind and solar [added to the grid],” said Cathy Liebowitz, director of member engagement for CEEM.

Flakoll said wind power has several factors working against it right now. Most of the windiest areas already have working turbines; solar farm construction costs are rapidly declining; and the massive scale of the typical wind project can complicate projects, he said.

State lawmakers passed a major energy permitting reform bill last year that could accelerate approvals for large-scale wind and solar installations, but the law won’t take effect until July.

Despite the wind slowdown, CEEM’s latest factsheet had some qualified good news for Minnesota utility customers. The average consumer paid 12.36 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2024, up 1.2% from 2023 and 30% from 2015, CEEM said. But that’s lower than the 2024 national average of 12.99 cents per kilowatt-hour — up 2.4% from 2023.

Minnesotans should blame the aging electric grid and volatile natural gas prices for steadily rising electricity rates, rather than wind and solar farms, Liebowitz and Flakoll said.

Transmission and distribution grid infrastructure account for 63% of the $45 billion Xcel Energy plans to invest through 2029, compared with 11% for renewable power, the utility said in November.

“The grid is old in general, so updating it regardless of whether it’s clean or not is something states are working on,” Liebowitz said.

Meanwhile, the actual cost of generating power is closely correlated with natural gas prices because gas-fired power plants tend to be the “last” units called on to meet demand, Flakoll said.

“If you rely on natural gas at the margin, you are going to affect bills,” he said. “To say renewables are the driving force behind these electricity rate increases would be overly simplistic and probably not true.”

With more than 1,900 delegates in attendance, this year’s edition drilled into the industry's top priorities: digital transformation, sustainability, and resilience.

From geopolitical disruptions to supply chain pressure and green targets, the air cargo sector is being reshaped—and WCS Dubai served as a platform to align ambition with action.

Brendan Sullivan, IATA’s Global Head of Cargo, set a serious tone, emphasising that “civil aviation must never be used as a pawn in geopolitical disputes,” while underlining the need for compliance and accountability in handling dangerous goods like lithium batteries. Safety, he stressed, cannot be compromised.

UAE Minister of Economy Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, welcoming delegates to Dubai, pointed to the aviation sector's central role in the country’s economic growth, contributing 13% to the national GDP, and highlighted the UAE’s bold push for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other clean energy solutions.

There was no shortage of ambition on display. Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, called data the most transformative force in air cargo today. “Because of digitalisation, we’re able to secure critical shipments and push the industry toward full automation,” he said. Still, he voiced concern over the high costs of e-SAF and the challenges ahead for net-zero goals.

Executives from dnata, Emirates SkyCargo, Cathay Cargo, and Kuehne+Nagel shared a candid look at how the industry is navigating its digital shift. Badr Abbas, Emirates’ new Divisional SVP for Cargo, and Clive Sauvé-Hopkins, CEO Airport Operations at dnata, emphasised Dubai’s growing influence as a logistics hub—powered by advanced cargo infrastructure and investments in sustainability.

From predictive AI in inventory management to the adoption of IATA ONE Record, digitalisation took centre stage. Speakers urged that tech-led transformation needs to extend beyond airlines and reach every node in the cargo chain—from ground handlers to freight forwarders.

Alina Fetisova, from the International Trade Centre, raised an important warning: “40% of young professionals are leaving the industry because of outdated systems.” Attracting and retaining talent, she noted, must be part of any digital strategy.

On the economic front, Maja Marciniak, Senior Economist at IATA, forecast a 6% growth in cargo demand for 2025. While yields remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, she cautioned that the net-zero transition is straining financial performance, and called for greater support from regulators and the value chain.

As the symposium concluded, one thing was clear: air cargo is no longer just about moving goods. It’s about moving faster, smarter, and greener. With global trade dynamics shifting and pressure for transparency growing, the industry is preparing for the future—with innovation at its core.

Looking ahead, IATA announced that WCS 2026 will take place in Lima, Peru, marking the event’s first appearance in South America—a nod to the growing global footprint of air cargo.",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/04/17/81119-1500-x-900-39.jpg,N,,2025-04-17 12:57:26.415018

Cemex's Rüdersdorf cement plant will supply the CO2 which will be combined with hydrogen at the Rüdesdorf site to produce e-kerosene.
Again, it is reliant on renewable energy to make electricity, hydrogen as a byproduct from the Kemira chemical plant and captured CO2 from the Lappeennranta cement plant.","This week the ECO2Fly project offered an insight into how captured CO2 emissions from a cement plant could be reused in the production of synthetic aviation fuel (e-SAF). Holcim's Villaluenga de la Sagra plant is capturing CO2 for this project. Meanwhile, Europe is leading the way in pioneering this type of project with further trials being carried out at the Ruedersdorf and Schwenk plants in Germany as well as methane generation at Finnsementti Oy.

ECO2Fly involves a partnership of Holcim, IGNIS P2X and Exolum. The Villaluenga de la Sagra plant in Toledo, Spain, is aiming to capture 0.7Mta of CO2 and it will combine this with green hydrogen developed from renewable energy, which can then be converted into sustainable aviation fuel. The project could see 10,0000tpa of aviation fuel produced, but Holcim will still need to permanently store any remaining captured CO2 in geological repositories. It is expected that the first decade of the ECO2Fly project will reduce CO2 emissions by 6.5Mt. However, the company is still waiting to submit a request for the European Union Innovation Funding in the next call-out, but global investment firm KKR has injected EUR400m to extend the timeline and scope of ECO2Fly and the green initiatives of Ignis P2X.

Ricardo de Pablos, CEO of Holcim España, said, “This strategic alliance between IGNIS P2X and Exolum represents a decisive step forward as part of our commitment to the transformation and decarbonisation of the industry. Not only are we making progress on reducing the carbon emissions of our own processes, but we are also driving a key innovation for construction in the form of cement with a total carbon reduction.”

Additional carbon utilisation projects with cement industry input

There are further e-SAF projects under development that will involve the cement sector. The European Commission has granted a EUR350m grant to the company, Concrete Chemicals, to produce 30,000t e-SAF annually from 2028. Cemex's Rüdersdorf cement plant will supply the CO2 which will be combined with hydrogen at the Rüdesdorf site to produce e-kerosene. Initially, the project has targeted 100t of captured CO2 to combine with 12t of hydrogen produced at Rüdersdorf. In the second stage, larger quantities of hydrogen will be supplied by pipeline. The green hydrogen production is part of the ENERTRAG-IPCEI 'Electrolysis Corridor East Germany' project, which will have an electrolysis capacity of 210MW and 35,000t of e-Kerosene annually.

Meanwhile, Schwenk Zement, Stuttgart Airport and SkyNRG have teamed up in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, to aid the STRzero climate strategy. Stuttgart Airport is aiming to reach net zero emissions by 2040 and its STRzero plan involves working with Schwenk Zement’s Heidenheim-Mergelstetten plant and SkyNRG to produce 50,000tpa of e-SAF. The three partners are contributing EUR1m to the project which is targeting e-fuel production in 2028.

“For the cement industry, the project is of enormous importance, because the meaningful use of carbon dioxide from the exhaust air of cement plants as a raw material is a major contribution to climate protection,” said Thomas Spannagl, CEO of Schwenk Zement.

A third project is participated in by Finnsementti Oy’s plant in Lappeennranta, Finland. Started in 2019, the collaboration with the Kemira chemical plant in Joutseno aimed to produce 270,000tpa of synthetic methanol. Methanol can be used to create petrol, kerosence or diesel. Again, it is reliant on renewable energy to make electricity, hydrogen as a byproduct from the Kemira chemical plant and captured CO2 from the Lappeennranta cement plant.",https://www.cemnet.com/images/opengraph.jpg,N,,2025-04-17 09:58:37.587413

FincoEnergies joins FuelEU compliance market

London, 16 April (Argus) — Netherlands-based fuel supplier FincoEnergies has launched a pooling service to help shipowners comply with FuelEU Maritime requirements. The service will enable undercompliant ships to meet their FuelEU requirements by pooling them with vessels that run on marine biodiesel supplied by FincoEnergies' own GoodFuels brand. The pooling service is also based on a partnership with maritime classification organisation Lloyd's Register, the company said. FincoEnergies said it will take the role of ""pool organiser"". The FuelEU Maritime regulation, which came into effect this year, sets greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets of 2pc for vessels travelling in or out of Europe. The reduction jumps to 6pc from 2030 and gradually reaches 80pc by 2050. The pooling mechanism built into FuelEU Maritime allows shipowners to combine vessels to achieve overall compliance across the pool, enabling a system by which compliance can be traded. Argus assessed the values of FuelEU Ucome-MGO abatement and Ucome-VLSFO abatement, prices which can be used as a metric to value compliance, at an average of $302.56/t of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) and $337.46/tCO2e, respectively, so far this year.

Funding cuts could delay US river lock work: Correction

Corrects lock locations in paragraph 5. Houston, 14 April (Argus) — The US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) will have to choose between various lock reconstruction and waterway projects for its annual construction plan after its funding was cut earlier this year. Last year Congress allowed the Corps to use $800mn from unspent infrastructure funds for other waterways projects. But when Congress passed a continuing resolutions for this year's budget they effectively removed that $800mn from what was a $2.6bn annual budget for lock reconstruction and waterways projects. This means a construction plan that must be sent to Congress by 14 May can only include $1.8bn in spending. No specific projects were allocated funding by Congress, allowing the Corps the final say on what projects it pursues under the new budget. River industry trade group Waterways Council said its top priority is for the Corps to provide a combined $205mn for work at the Montgomery lock in Pennsylvania on the Ohio River and Chickamauga lock in Tennessee on the Tennessee River since they are the nearest to completion and could become more expensive if further delayed. There are seven active navigation construction projects expected to take precedent, including the following: the Chickamauga and Kentucky Locks on the Tennessee River; Locks 2-4 on the Monongahela River; the Three Rivers project on the Arkansas River; the LaGrange Lock on the Illinois River; Lock 25 on the Mississippi River; and the Montgomery Lock on the Ohio River. There are three other locks in Texas, Pennsylvania and Illinois that are in the active design phase (see map) .

IMO GHG pricing not yet Paris deal-aligned: EU

Brussels, 14 April (Argus) — The International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) global greenhouse gas (GHG) pricing mechanism ""does not yet ensure the sector's full contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement goals"", the European Commission has said. ""Does it have everything for everybody? For sure, it doesn't,"" said Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, the commission's climate and energy spokesperson said. ""This is often the case as an outcome from international negotiations, that not everybody gets the most optimal outcome."" The IMO agreement reached last week will need to be confirmed by the organisation in October, the EU noted, even if it is a ""strong foundation"" and ""meaningful step"" towards net zero GHG emissions in global shipping by 2050. The commission will have 18 months following the IMO mechanism's formal approval to review the directive governing the bloc's emissions trading system (ETS), which currently includes maritime emissions for intra-EU voyages and those entering or leaving the bloc. By EU law, the commission will also have to report on possible ""articulation or alignment"" of the bloc's FuelEU Maritime regulation with the IMO, including the need to ""avoid duplicating regulation of GHG emissions from maritime transport"" at EU and international levels. That report should be presented, ""without delay"", following formal adoption of an IMO global GHG fuel standard or global GHG intensity limit. Finland's head representative at the IMO delegation talks, Anita Irmeli, told Argus that the EU's consideration of whether the approved Marpol amendments are ambitious enough won't be until ""well after October"". Commenting on the IMO agreement, the European Biodiesel Board (EBB) pointed to the ""neutral"" approach to feedstocks, including first generation biofuels. ""The EBB welcomes this agreement, where all feedstocks and pathways have a role to play,"" EBB secretary general Xavier Noyon said. Faig Abbasov, shipping director at non-governmental organisation Transport and Environment, called for better incentives for green hydrogen. ""The IMO deal creates a momentum for alternative marine fuels. But unfortunately it is the forest-destroying first generation biofuels that will get the biggest push for the next decade,"" he said.

Malaysian Fathopes to reach SAF plant FID by 1Q 2026

Singapore, 14 April (Argus) — Malaysian biofuel feedstock supplier Fathopes Energy's planned sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant will reach a final investment decision (FID) in the first quarter of 2026, it said. Intital engineering design will be done from July to December 2025, Fathopes' director Eddy Leong said at an event on 10 April, speaking on behalf of the company's chief executive Vinesh Sinha. The plant's capacity is unconfirmed. Fathopes signed an initial agreement at the event with testing, inspection and certification company AmSpec Group. They aim to identify, assess and document feedstocks across Asia-Pacific, Australia and New Zealand that can be used at the planned plant. The agreement will take effect from 1 June. Besides used cooking oil (UCO), other waste feedstocks such as palm oil mill effluent (Pome) oil and spent bleaching earth oil (SBEO) will be explored. Fathopes will take the lead in collecting feedstock samples, while AmSpec will analyse their suitability for SAF production. Amspec will help develop an on-site SAF laboratory at the plant to ensure compliance with industry standards and environmental regulations. Fathopes had signed an initial agreement with Danish technology firm Topsoe in February, in which Topsoe agreed to provide catalysts and engineering expertise to assess feasibility of building the refinery.

Earth Day 2025 serves as a global call to action, highlighting the urgent need to transition towards renewable energy solutions. The theme, “Our Power, Our Planet,” reinforces the connection between clean energy and a sustainable future, urging industries worldwide to accelerate their decarbonisation efforts.

Aviation and corporate travel remain essential for global business and connectivity, yet they contribute significantly to carbon emissions. While reducing travel altogether would be the most sustainable option, for many businesses and industries, flying remains a necessity. This is particularly true for sectors like marine, energy, and sports, where travel is critical to operations.

To address this challenge, the aviation industry must look beyond carbon measurement tools—which report on emissions but do not mitigate them—and focus on practical solutions for emissions reduction, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF represents a key pathway to reducing the carbon footprint of air travel while ensuring essential mobility continues.

Why Aviation Needs Alternative Energy Solutions

Aviation accounts for 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, making it a priority sector for decarbonisation. While emerging technologies such as hydrogen and electric aircraft hold long-term promise, SAF is the most viable and scalable solution available today to reduce aviation emissions.

SAF is produced from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste, and can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to fossil jet fuel. Crucially, SAF is a drop-in fuel, meaning it can be used in existing aircraft without requiring infrastructure modifications.

Despite its benefits, widespread adoption of SAF faces challenges related to availability, production scaling, and cost. Greater industry commitment and corporate action are essential to drive demand and investment in SAF production, just as policy support.

The Role of SAF in Sustainable Corporate Travel

For businesses committed to reducing Scope 3 emissions—which include travel-related emissions—SAF presents an immediate opportunity to make meaningful reductions. Corporate travel policies can integrate SAF procurement alongside other sustainability initiatives, such as optimising travel schedules, reducing unnecessary trips and investing in verified offset programmes.

Neste is the world’s leading producer of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and has partnered with ATPI to help businesses reduce their travel-related emissions. Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel is in commercial use today and available at a growing number of key airports worldwide, and can also be accessed via the ATPI x Neste partnership.

Key benefits of SAF:

Immediate carbon reductions – Up to 80% lower GHG emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle compared to fossil jet fuel.

Ready to be used – SAF can be used in existing aircraft and refuelling systems.

Scalable for corporate travel – Businesses can incorporate SAF procurement into travel policies.

Driving Corporate Action: Business Travel & SAF

While airlines and governments play a role in scaling SAF, corporate buyers also have the power to accelerate adoption by integrating SAF into their travel programmes. ATPI and Neste provide solutions such as Neste Impact, a book-and-claim system aligned with Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) standards. This allows businesses to purchase SAF and claim emissions reductions even if the fuel is not available at their departure airports.

How Businesses Can Take Action Today:

Set concrete emissions reduction targets to track and reduce the impact of business travel.

Incorporate SAF into travel programmes to enable immediate, credible emissions reductions.

Use carbon measurement tools to monitor travel activity and inform sustainability decisions.

ATPI x Neste: A Shared Commitment to Decarbonisation

Through their partnership, ATPI and Neste are working to empower businesses to make low-carbon travel choices and support the shift towards renewable energy in aviation.

UK LCC easyJet Director General Javier Gándara, TUI director of communications for airlines, hotels and cruises, Aage Dünhaupt, and Aena head of environmental sustainability, Susana Gallart Peñas, discussed aviation sustainability last week during a conference panel at Routes Europe 2025 in Seville.

All were asked how confident they were in the air transport industry being able to achieve the self-imposed net zero goal after IATA Director General Willie Walsh acknowledged earlier this year that the 2050 target may slip because of government policies and the lack of SAF.

But the panelists remained optimistic.

“I think it will still be possible. Thirty years ago, people were saying flying would not be affordable and now it is. We have a clear roadmap,” easyJet’s Gándara said. “SAF is something that will be important in the short, medium and long term. At easyJet, we are working with Airbus on developing a hydrogen-powered, zero-emissions aircraft. The problem is with regulators. They have to have political courage. They have to work to get SAF production scaled up and to address issues like action on the [European Union air traffic management modernization] Single European Sky.”

Aena’s Gallart Peñas, whose company manages 46 airports and two heliports in Spain and participates directly and indirectly in the management of some 16 airports in Europe and the U.S., agreed—but she also stressed the time to move the dial on aviation sustainability is running short.

“2050 must be possible, but the next five years will be critical for us,” she said. “I think we have just five years to change things.”

TUI’s Dünhaupt added: “You have to be ambitious, and when you have targets, they should be ambitious. But we don’t want to change the behavior of flying. We need politicians’ support for things to happen, and SAF is a big part of the solution. But we also need to do some honest stock-taking, and if there’s not enough SAF, we need to move the [net zero] target to the right.”

Dünhaupt also said that North American sustainability policy would be different under U.S. President Donald Trump and that it is important that competitive playing fields remain level across the air transport industry, which is global, as sustainability rules and mandates come into effect.

Gándara agreed. “The biggest challenge is that sustainability doesn’t affect air travel affordability,” he said. Gándara also emphasized that European regulators are missing “a huge opportunity for Europe to become energy self-sufficient” if they do not take action on scaling up SAF production.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-04-17 06:56:07.952261

“If airlines are committing to net-zero by 2050, policymakers have to take sharper targets,” said Singh of Air India Express.
According to Air India Express’ internal estimates, about 30 such initiatives can improve efficiency by 4-5%.
For us, it’s existential.” To meet net-zero targets, experts feel India needs to treat aviation sustainability as a national priority, not just an airline issue.","India, now the world’s third-largest aviation market, is responsible for 2.5% of global emissions but contributes just about 1% of national carbon emissions—below the global average. Yet, this relatively benign share masks a fast-growing challenge. With air travel demand projected to grow exponentially, emissions are set to rise in tandem.

Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director of SpiceJet, put it bluntly at a panel discussion hosted by MakeMyTrip Foundation's India Travel and Tourism Sustainability Conclave 2025: “Sustainability clearly was not on [the airlines’] minds” during the COVID-19 pandemic, when survival was paramount. But as recovery takes hold, Singh adds, “Sustainability will again be front and centre... but it has to make economic sense.” The cost of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is 2.5 times the cost of conventional fuel, is simply unaffordable for most carriers. “You can’t pass that on to consumers... they will not pay that kind of money,” says Singh.

Experts at the panel also feared that with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) set to become mandatory in 2027, airlines will face additional cost burdens if SAF production doesn’t ramp up. Yet, there is no mature carbon offset market in India today. “We’re doing nothing,” Aditya Ghosh, co-founder of Akasa Air admitted candidly while other panellists agreed. “And we’re just two years away from CORSIA kicking in.”

CORSIA is a global initiative led by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Starting in 2027, it enters a mandatory phase for most major aviation nations. Under the scheme, airlines will need to offset any carbon emissions that go beyond their 2020 levels by buying approved carbon credits.

“CORSIA has set impossible targets. It tries to limit countries to the emission levels of the number of aircraft that they had in 2020. That has to be opposed,” said Singh.

“The 2027 CORSIA targets are unrealistic and unfair for countries like India. We will continue to work with ICAO and see that these norms are not unfair to developing countries and not biased towards developed countries,” he added.

In tune, Aloke Singh, managing director of Air India Express, said that CORSIA will pose a significant burden on airlines. “If the SAF production gets further delayed, the burdens of carbon offset, due to CORSIA, will rise further.”

CAPA’s CEO Kapil Kaul, who moderated the session, opined that given that none of the Indian carriers are ready to meet the targets set under CORSIA, it’s possible the target could be deferred.

Where SAF Stands

SAF has emerged as the only viable short-term lever for reducing aviation emissions. The good news is that India has shown technical capability. SpiceJet, for instance, flew India’s first SAF-powered flight in 2018—from Dehradun to Delhi—using fuel made in a laboratory at the Indian Institute of Petroleum. “The engines don’t need to be modified. It works just really well,” Singh emphasised.

Trending Stories

But the barriers to commercial scaling are immense. Current SAF production is just 0.53% of total fuel consumption globally, and even in Europe—the leader in SAF adoption—KLM and Air France clock just 0.84% and 0.42% respectively. According to CAPA India’s internal assessment, the world is more than 5 million tonnes short annually of the SAF needed to hit 2030 targets.

Ghosh argued that India actually has a unique opportunity: “India now has about 160 million tonnes of feedstock... which can be used for SAF production. Ironically, we have a chance to become a net SAF exporter.” But for that to happen, “you have to identify the feedstock, build manufacturing, logistics and treat this as an export-focused sector.”

The challenge, then, is not technical feasibility but economic and logistical scale. Singh noted that the cost of building even one SAF unit—like the pilot project at Panipat with IOCL—was just ₹150 crore. “These are not large sums of money,” he said, “but the political will is missing.” According to Ghosh, government support in the form of viability gap funding could kickstart production, just as it did for electric bus infrastructure in India.

Targets and the Reality Check

India’s SAF blending target—1% by 2025, increasing to 2% by 2027 and 5% by 2030—is far too modest, the panellists unanimously agreed. “If airlines are committing to net-zero by 2050, policymakers have to take sharper targets,” said Singh of Air India Express. He added, “The sum of money required isn’t humongous. Just let them blend more.”

Yet, scaling SAF isn't only about blending targets. There's also a technological bottleneck. Of the 13 ASTM-approved pathways for SAF production, only a few have been commercialised. “80% of SAF facilities globally are using hydrotreatment technology,” pointed out Kaul. “Other technologies are not getting clearances or are still in the research phase.”

Economics Over Environment

One of the core dilemmas underscored was that while sustainability measures tend to align with cost savings in areas like engine efficiency and operational performance, they become a burden when it comes to SAF.

“There’s no free lunch,” said Singh of Air India Express. “If we don’t pay as industry, the taxpayer will pay. If the consumer doesn’t pay, someone has to pay.” Today, sustainable alternatives drive up costs rather than bringing them down, which reverses the economics that previously spurred efficiency in aviation.

The industry is currently relying on gradual efficiency gains—about 2 to 2.5% annually over the last few decades—through better engines, newer aircraft, and improved operational techniques. “Per passenger emissions have halved since I joined the industry,” shared Singh, “and that was when sustainability wasn’t even a buzzword—it was driven purely by economics.”

Small Gains Matter, But Are They Enough?

Several small but significant practices—like continuous descent operations, better climb optimisation (OptiClimb), single-engine taxiing, and cleaner aircraft surfaces—offer immediate gains. According to Air India Express’ internal estimates, about 30 such initiatives can improve efficiency by 4-5%. But implementation remains erratic.

“There’s been talk of continuous descent and shorter air routes for years,” Kaul pointed out. “Yet Delhi-Bombay block time is now 2 hours 10 minutes, and congestion is only increasing.” The larger question, he added, is “Who takes leadership and who takes ownership?”

The answer, the panel seemed to agree, lies at the highest levels of government. “Flexible use of airspace is possible. Better routing is possible. But unless the top political leadership is sensitised, it won’t happen,” Singh asserted.

Even if airlines adopt best practices and strive for fleet modernisation, without meaningful SAF production or an offset market, the industry will struggle to comply with global frameworks.

What the Future Looks Like

Despite the odds, there are reasons for cautious optimism. Indian carriers are already investing heavily in next-gen aircraft. “In five years, we will be flying the youngest fleet in the sky,” Ghosh said. “Which basically means, by math, we will be emitting the least.”

Air India Express, for example, moved from just 10% of its fleet being new-gen aircraft to 50% in a year. “By next year, two-thirds will be new-gen,” confirmed Singh. But he also noted that sustainability should not be limited to fuel and emissions—it must encompass water, circular economy practices, and broader social impact.

The panel agreed that while the airline industry can and should do more, it cannot go it alone. As Singh summarised, “You cannot expect airlines to bear an additional 15-20% cost to make this happen. For petroleum companies, it’s marginal. For us, it’s existential.” To meet net-zero targets, experts feel India needs to treat aviation sustainability as a national priority, not just an airline issue.",https://media.fortuneindia.com/fortune-india%2F2025-04-17%2F980cxqer%2F1000279020.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-04-17 04:56:06.801673

Paradoxically, this trend persists even as these financial companies pursue net-zero goals.

In fact, around half (52%) of respondents see themselves as on track to meet their climate goals, while a much larger 86% said they are either on track or at least ‘partially on track’. Organizations in the Americas were generally the most on track with climate goals – more than those in Europe or Asia Pacific.

“The survey results demonstrate that financial institutions continue to back investments in green infrastructure and are willing to increase their exposure to climate-resilient assets and portfolio companies,” said Daniel Klier, CEO of South Pole.

“However, it is also clear that the sector is no longer taking an active role in shifting the balance and will continue to finance fossil fuels. Financial institutions want to have their cake and eat it too.”

When asked what they feel is holding financial institutions back, more than half (55%) pointed to a lack of clear industry-specific guidelines and 47% cited a lack of progress from organizations they provide financing to. Another 42% cited a lack of support from government policy.

Climate transition plans

Another important part of making progress on net-zero goals is having a climate transition plan. Exactly half of the financial institutions surveyed reported having an ‘extensive and credible’ climate transition plan in place already. The vast majority of respondents (88%) said they currently have at least some form of plan in place.

The report found that larger institutions have made more significant strides in their climate transition plans when compared with their smaller counterparts. That may come as no surprise, considering that the smaller organizations are far less likely to have extensive funding available for climate initiatives.

Financial institutions in major hubs like the UK, Singapore, and the US overwhelmingly favor investing in companies with climate transition plans, finding them more attractive. This preference stems from financial organizations seeking climate-prepared entities with ambitious net-zero goals, as many struggle to meet their own climate targets due to insufficient progress from their financed companies.

Carbon credits

Many financial institutions also have carbon credit strategies in place. Carbon credits serve two main purposes: To go beyond the immediate value chain in mitigating climate change and to neutralize remaining emissions on an institution’s path to achieving net zero.

Many investors see carbon markets and projects as a potential new asset class, recognizing the increasing demand for high-quality carbon removal credits. This has been driving investment in this sector.

Financial institutions have also been pushing their portfolio companies towards using carbon credits in their net-zero strategies. The growing significance of compliance carbon markets is expected to further increase demand and prices, presenting a notable opportunity for the financial sector.

Delaying climate action means more risk

Put simply, financial institutions are increasingly looking to reduce their exposure to risk, which is seen as a crucial part of future-proofing a business. Organizations that have ESG initiatives in place are seen as far less exposed to climate-related risks, which have clearly been on the rise in recent years around the world.

“While the financiers surveyed continue to drive climate-related engagement with their clients, it also becomes clear that financial institutions have to walk a tightrope, balancing the long-term resilience and efficiency of their business against returns for investors in the short term,” said Klier.

“It is important to embrace the positive tipping points created by new, cleaner, and more competitive technologies; but the sector is running major transition and physical risks when it delays its response to obvious climate tipping points.”",https://www.consultancy.eu/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-04-16-024336793-Most_financial_institutions_still_see_fossil_fuels_as_a_key_part_of_the_investment_mix_spot.jpg,N,,2025-04-17 07:56:25.189570

HOUSTON, April 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Syzygy Plasmonics has successfully completed performance testing of the world’s largest all-electric GHG e-Reforming™ demonstration unit in Houston. After over 3000 hours of rigorous trials in Houston and Ulsan, South Korea with its cutting-edge Rigel™ Reactor, the unit demonstrates a critical breakthrough in low-cost, high-yield sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

Current approaches to SAF require expensive credits or a high price to cover production costs. Syzygy’s novel approach uses inexpensive biogas that would otherwise be flared or sold at commodity prices into reasonably priced SAF. This monetizes stranded, valuable feedstock assets, fulfilling critical demand for low carbon aviation fuels. Biogas projects require expensive technologies to produce renewable natural gas (RNG) via CO2 separation. Syzygy’s novel approach uses biogas directly from an anaerobic digester or landfills with minimal preparation to produce syngas for SAF or other industry standard renewable transportation fuels.

Syzygy’s revolutionary biogas-to-SAF method is unlocking new possibilities. Its modular design monetizes valuable biogas sources from dairy farms, landfills, and wastewater sites into valuable biogas sources, without the need for pipelines or costly infrastructure.

“Syzygy’s groundbreaking biogas-to-SAF technology is reshaping sustainable aviation fuel production. This demonstration plant achieves Syzygy’s first major step in our mission to expand SAF production and transform energy. We will build on this milestone by continuing to enhance performance in Houston while developing biogas to SAF projects built around our technology globally.”– Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics.

Syzygy will continuously enhance performance and test various feedstocks to support further project development opportunities, customer testing and validation of the GHG e-Reforming ™ unit capabilities.

Gevo Inc. and Future Energy Global are pleased to announce that they have signed a pioneering offtake agreement for carbon abatement attributes, to enable airlines and other companies to reduce their CO2 emissions through sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Under the multi-year agreement, FEG will acquire from Gevo the Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions credits from 10 million gallons per year of fuel to be produced at Gevo’s alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) SAF production facility, Gevo ATJ-60, to meet demand from FEG customers, both airlines and corporates, seeking to decarbonize their operations. The agreement also includes an option for FEG to increase the off-take at a later date.

This agreement is expected to help enable Gevo’s financing of the construction of its ATJ-60 facility. Gevo has secured a loan guarantee conditional commitment of $1.63 billion (including capitalized interest during construction) from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO) and is originating equity from project level capital providers. Under development in Lake Preston, South Dakota, ATJ-60 is designed to address the market need for cost-effective jet fuel while abating carbon and to respond to growing worldwide demand for SAF. Gevo's proprietary plant design is expected to be able to produce 60 million gallons of SAF per year at similar production costs to conventional jet fuel, but with far lower carbon emissions.

The aviation industry has targeted net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, and SAF is expected to contribute around two thirds of the necessary emissions reduction, but to achieve this, its production quantities need to scale more than 400-fold. SAF is not yet available at all major airports worldwide so FEG provides SAF-derived Scope 1 credits to airlines who wish to buy additional SAF but who cannot easily source the physical fuel at their own airports. Similarly, when companies purchase and retire SAF-derived Scope 3 credits to compensate for their business travel emissions, they mitigate the added cost of SAF to airlines and thus enable the faster scale-up of SAF production.

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol defines different “scopes” of responsibility for emissions. The emissions from a flight fall under an airline’s direct responsibility (i.e., Scope 1), but a company with staff flying for business on that flight is responsible for its staff’s share of the flight’s emissions (i.e., Scope 3 or indirect emissions). Separating the Scope 1 and Scope 3 attributes from the physical fuel, an approach known as “Book and Claim,” reduces fuel transportation and storage costs and carbon emissions, and unlocks a global SAF market both for airlines and for indirect aviation fuel customers around the world who are seeking to mitigate their emissions.

“Gevo has always planned to leverage SAF market economics to scale our business, and a Book and Claim market that enables the trading of SAF environmental attributes can accelerate SAF production even faster,” says Patrick R. Gruber, CEO of Gevo. “Future Energy Global is building just such a market, spanning corporate customers, airlines, and aircraft lessors. Aircraft lessors own about half of all commercial aircraft worldwide, and Book and Claim is a critical enabler to allow them and their airline customers to adopt SAF faster.”

“FEG’s collaboration with Gevo strongly enhances the portfolio of Book and Claim solutions we can offer our airlines, our lessors and our corporate customers,” says Natasha Mann, CEO and co-founder of FEG. “It’s crucial to scale SAF production, and our business model lets us unlock the capital to do so. We’re impressed with Gevo’s pipeline, which combines technology ready for today’s market and additional technologies far along in development that could increase production efficiency and accelerate the trajectory of SAF scaling.”

FEG’s unique business model brings together investors, suppliers, and buyers to help accelerate and scale SAF production globally. FEG generates additional revenue streams by commercializing the carbon credits which SAF provides, enhancing the business case for faster production scale-up. FEG’s offtake agreement with Gevo is expected to fulfill a market need by giving buyers access to SAF credits at predictable prices, while providing financial commitments and revenue certainty that are expected to allow suppliers like Gevo to expand. FEG’s initial focus has been on aviation, though its sustainable-fuel credit solutions span the transport spectrum, including marine and land transport.

So that's a perspective, irrespective of what your favorite technology is, where there's a common point.” John Carberry is a freelance writer for Cornell Engineering.","With a dedication to transforming scientific discovery into real-world impact, Tobias Hanrath, a Cornell Engineering nanomaterials and energy researcher, has been appointed Croll Professor of Sustainable Energy Systems and lead for the college’s research pillar in Engineering Energy Transitions.

As the designated point person for one of the college’s strategic research priorities, Hanrath will provide strategic advice about new research initiatives, facilitate collaborations with the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability and others, and shape academic programs that equip students and faculty to advance the future of clean energy technologies.

“The next phase of our Cornell Engineering 2030 plan calls for strategic investments in people, programs and infrastructure that position the college for meaningful societal impact in priority research areas,” said Lynden Archer, the Joseph Silbert Dean of Engineering. “I see value in identifying faculty champions who can help focus these investments, inspire students and advise their dean. Piloting this approach with Tobias was a natural decision given his reputation as an innovator and leader in the energy systems area.”

By his own admission, the mission suits Hanrath, who is based in in the R.F. Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and is a longtime fellow in the Atkinson Center.

“One of our unique advantages is that, at a place like Cornell, which is big and has a wide range of fields and disciplines, there are a lot of great minds,” Hanrath said, citing the pioneering research of peers in everything from chemistry, artificial intelligence and energy storage to innovations at the interface of agriculture and engineering. “There are real opportunities at the intersections. My approach is to ask: What are people passionate about on campus? What is the collective skill set that we have?”

An illustrative example of this approach in action is Hanrath’s earlier work co-founding Dimensional Energy, a startup company that emerged from a collaboration between his research lab and that of David Erickson, director of the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. By leveraging breakthroughs in catalysis and materials science, Dimensional Energy is developing technology to transform carbon dioxide emissions into sustainable aviation fuel.

The company’s success reflects Hanrath’s commitment to bridging academic research and commercial viability. In a major step toward industry adoption, Dimensional Energy announced in 2022 a partnership with United Airlines in which the aviation company would purchase at least 300 million gallons of fuel and invest into further research and development.

In addition to entrepreneurship, Hanrath also sees opportunity to bridge research and education. He hopes to prepare students for the evolving energy landscape by introducing new courses on energy policy and regulations, and by building new design studios for Master of Engineering students working directly with industry partners on research and development challenges.

Hanrath said he sees his role as facilitating an evolution rather than a revolution. Helping Cornell Engineering leap forward in energy transitions is not about changing what students and faculty are doing around energy and sustainability, he stressed, but instead taking a “systems-level approach” to increasing awareness of academic and research efforts across campus, and finding mechanisms to translate that work into close partnerships with other institutions and energy industry leaders.

This systems-level approach is exemplified by the establishment of the Cornell Advanced Platform for Testing, Utilization, and Research in CO2 Capture and Conversion Technologies, also known as the CAPTURE-Lab, in which nine faculty members from across campus will establish an experimental facility at Cornell’s Combined Heat and Power Plant.

The project is led by Hanrath; Phillip Milner, assistant professor of chemistry and chemical biology in the College of Arts and Sciences; and Greeshma Gadikota, associate professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. The team plans to establish a mobile lab adjacent to the plant that will analyze gas emissions and provide real-time information about its composition. They will then examine and test materials for carbon capture and conversion, supporting interdisciplinary research on both basic science and lab-to-market feasibility.

By finding the paths and the collaborations that promise the greatest real-world success, Hanrath hopes to build at Cornell Engineering a “center of gravity” in which talent and partners from across campus – and around the world – will organically convene.

Creating that center of gravity requires internal and external awareness, and Hanrath said he plans to invest a significant portion of his new position into communicating broadly about Cornell Engineering’s energy research and its impact.

“Part of what we need to establish here is, if you want to have impactful work in energy and translate ideas into impacts, Cornell should be on your radar,” Hanrath said. “In the future, we all want to have a world that is better than what it is now. So that's a perspective, irrespective of what your favorite technology is, where there's a common point.”

The industry has tough net zero emissions-related SAF adoption targets to meet and working collaboratively on fuel procurement and investment is crucial to increase SAF usage, agreed a sustainability panel duringt IATA's 2025 World Cargo Symposium (WCS).

Helene Goury, sustainability manager at Air France KLM Martinair Cargo said that AFKLM aims to reach 10% of SAF in its fuel usage by 2030.

The business currently has around 1.5% SAF fuel usage, which is three times the industry average.

Partnerships aided this SAF adoption and other sustainability initiatives within the airline, said Goury. In fact, the group has major partnerships with DG Fuels, Neste and TotalEnergies.

“It’s collaboration. Air France KLM has looked into investments since 2023. For example, we invested $4.7bn into DG Fuels (into its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production plant in the US).”

She added: “We also did a partnership with Neste to try 100% of SAF into (aircraft) engines. That was successfully demonstrating the positive use of SAF.

“More recently we collaborated with TotalEnergies, which will supply up to 1.5m tons of SAF over a 10-year period.”

Additionally, she added that Air France KLM was working with partners to invest in an e-SAF plant.

Finnair Cargo has also been partnering with Neste since 2020 and Janike Heimonen, sales and sustainability manager at Finnair Cargo simply stressed: “Partnerships are important for SAF.”

She said that collaboration is also important in ascertaining cutomers’ awareness of SAF and its value to them and further, how to support them in uptake of the fuel.

“It’s all about the collaboration between the whole value chain,” she said.

From the perspective of a customer, Kintesu World Express is focused on robust relationships with airlines, credibility and transparency of SAF, price and information sharing.

In alignment with this, shippers are more interested in SAF, declared Frederik van de Ven, director of sustainability (EMEA) and lead supply chain sustainability (Global) at Kintesu.

“Shippers are more committed to SAF you see that SAF price per kilo is being asked about in RFQs,"" he commented.

This means SAF can be blended with regular jet fuel without requiring modifications to aircraft or infrastructure.
According to the data, SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil-based jet fuel.
According to Reginelli, SAF production is projected to begin in earnest by 2027, with more investment being made in bringing new production capacity online.","A few weeks ago, we presented a look at the future of renewable diesel and what this might mean for soybean demand. In addition, another alternative fuel that also promises to grow U.S.-grown crop demand as a feedstock source is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

By its basic definition, SAF is a biofuel used to power aircraft. It is made from non-petroleum feedstocks (derived from such crops as corn and soybeans) and is a “drop-in” fuel. This means SAF can be blended with regular jet fuel without requiring modifications to aircraft or infrastructure.

According to Michael Reginelli, Risk Management Consultant at Advance Trading, Inc., SAF could be “a very big deal” when it comes to ethanol demand.

“The aviation industry is definitely looking at this,” said Reginelli, speaking at the 2025 Ohio Agribusiness Association annual meeting in late January. “As environmental regulations change – not only in the U.S. but in other countries as well – aviation companies are going to increasingly look for alternatives.”

And given the facts, it’s easy to understand why SAF is an attractive alternative to traditional aviation fuel. According to the data, SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil-based jet fuel. As Reginelli summed up: “The carbon reduction with SAF is massive.”

Right now, reported Reginelli, the U.S. has a mandate in place to have the country’s aviation industry reduce its carbon emissions by 20% by the end of this decade. Some individual airline companies have set their own emission reduction numbers as well.

“Southwest Airlines wants to be a net carbon zero company by 2030,” he said.

Valero Energy Corporation (“Valero”) announced on April 16, 2025, that its subsidiary, Valero Refining Company-California, has submitted notice to the California Energy Commission of its current intent to idle, restructure, or cease refining operations at Valero’s Benicia Refinery by the end of April 2026. Valero continues to evaluate strategic alternatives for its remaining operations in California.

As of March 31, 2025, in connection with the evaluation of strategic alternatives for Valero’s operations in California, Valero evaluated the assets of the Benicia and Wilmington refineries for impairment and concluded that the carrying value of these assets was not recoverable. Valero recorded a combined pre-tax impairment charge of $1.1 billion for the Benicia and Wilmington refineries, which is expected to be treated as a special item and excluded from first quarter 2025 adjusted earnings. Included in this amount is the recognition of expected asset retirement obligations of $337 million as of March 31, 2025, which mainly reflects a change in the expected timing of estimated costs for certain legal obligations to retire the assets.

HOUSTON, April 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Syzygy Plasmonics has successfully completed performance testing of the world's largest all-electric GHG e-Reforming™ demonstration unit in Houston. After over 3000 hours of rigorous trials in Houston and Ulsan, South Korea with its cutting-edge Rigel™ Reactor, the unit demonstrates a critical breakthrough in low-cost, high-yield sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

Current approaches to SAF require expensive credits or a high price to cover production costs. Syzygy's novel approach uses inexpensive biogas that would otherwise be flared or sold at commodity prices into reasonably priced SAF. This monetizes stranded, valuable feedstock assets, fulfilling critical demand for low carbon aviation fuels. Biogas projects require expensive technologies to produce renewable natural gas (RNG) via CO2 separation. Syzygy's novel approach uses biogas directly from an anaerobic digester or landfills with minimal preparation to produce syngas for SAF or other industry standard renewable transportation fuels.

Syzygy's revolutionary biogas-to-SAF method is unlocking new possibilities. Its modular design monetizes valuable biogas sources from dairy farms, landfills, and wastewater sites into valuable biogas sources, without the need for pipelines or costly infrastructure.

""Syzygy's groundbreaking biogas-to-SAF technology is reshaping sustainable aviation fuel production. This demonstration plant achieves Syzygy's first major step in our mission to expand SAF production and transform energy. We will build on this milestone by continuing to enhance performance in Houston while developing biogas to SAF projects built around our technology globally.""– Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics.

Technip and Lanzajet join LERA who serves as a project manager, as contractors for Project Ulysses.

Named after North Queensland butterfly, Papilio ulysses, the project in Australia’s Townsville State Development Area seeks to produce renewable diesel and SAF from bioethanol. The two renewable fuels to be pumped into the aviation market are sourced from agricultural by-products. Set to deliver 11 million liters of renewable diesel and 102 million liters of SAF annually, Project Ulysses will utilize Lanzajet’s Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) technology.

Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses targets completion and commissioning by 2028. This will set precedence for the achievement of sustainability goals. At its core is the reduction of jet aircraft CO2 emissions. This is an estimated reduction of around 65% when compared to traditional fossil fuel, like jet kerosene, used in the aviation industry.

Janelle Poole MP, an Assistant Minister in Queensland termed Project Ulysses as a means for the exploration of “new industries across Queensland, particularly focusing on economic growth in the regions.”

Sustainability at Forefront of Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses

According to the International Energy Association (IEA), aviation accounts for up to 2.5% of global CO2 emissions. The number stood at 940.6 metric tons (Mt) of CO2 as of 2023. According to IEA, this number will surpass 1000 Mt of CO2 by 2030 if the aviation industry lags in change. This also sets the aviation industry’s emission growth rate in the two previous decade, higher than other means of transport like road and rail.

To achieve the global, and International Civil Aviation Organization’s, Net Zero by 2050 goal, several mechanisms have been put in place in the aviation sector. These include use of low carbon fuel like SAF and renewable diesel from bioethanol from Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses. These are also coupled by engineering and design changes to aircraft, like improving airframe and engine designs. Also proposed are technologies like electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft in place of kerosene-powered aircraft.

Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses and the local economy’s long-term outlook

Also in Project Ulysses’ long term development goals is the expansion Townsville economy. Jet Zero’s SAF and renewable diesel project in Townsville will create more than 100 operational jobs at the facility once its commissioned. This will also be superposed by the 1,000 construction jobs to be delivered once Project Ulysses starts construction. The project will also supply renewable diesel to the local Australian energy market, ramping up renewable energy use in sectors like mining, transport, and tourism.

In the rather, grand scheme of things, Project Ulysses also aims to make Townsville in Australia’s Northern Queensland a renewable energy hub. Also in Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses mission is to make Queensland a global leader in the low-emissions biofuels industry.

Other SAF project in Australia include Project Mandala. A partnership project steered by Jet Zero and Apeiron Bioenergy. It is currently advancing feasibility studies after grant funding award by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and Enterprise Singapore.",https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Technip-Joins-Jet-Zeros-Renewable-Diesel-and-Bioethanol-Aviation-Fuel-Project-Ulysses-as-FEED-Contractor-png.webp,N,,2025-04-16 17:56:58.845900
