The existing 45Z tax credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provides a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels.
Additional changes to the 45Z credit aim to restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.
In addition, the draft bill seeks to phase out the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) for clean electricity.
“The SAF Coalition applauds the House of Representatives for extending the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) through 2031,” said Alison Graab, executive director of the SAF Coalition.","The U.S. House of Representatives early on May 22 narrowly passed a reconciliation bill that includes provisions updating and extending the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit. The bill, H.R. 1, commonly known as the “big, beautiful bill,” will now be considered by the U.S. Senate.

The existing 45Z tax credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provides a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels. The credit starts at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit is up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. The tax credit is currently in place for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

Section 111112 of the H.R. 1 aims to limit availability of the 45Z credit to fuels produced from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico or Canada. It also aims to exclude indirect land use change (ILUC) from being used to calculate the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of eligible fuel and directs the U.S. Treasury Department to establish distinct emissions rates for specific manure feedstocks, including dairy manure, swine manure and poultry manure.

The draft bill would extend the 45Z credit through Dec. 31, 2031. Additional changes to the 45Z credit aim to restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.

Section 10106 extends funding for the USDA’s Biobased Markets Program and the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels program through 2031. The Biobased Markets Program, commonly referred to as the Biopreferred Program, aims to expand the use of biobased products through a voluntary labeling program and federal procurement requirements, while the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels program provides payments to eligible producers of advanced biofuels. According to the bill language, current funding levels of $3 million and $7 million per fiscal year, respectively, would be continued through 2031.

H.R. 1 leaves the 45Q credit for carbon sequestration largely intact but aims to enact restrictions on transferability. Specifically, the legislation would repeal transferability for carbon capture equipment where construction begins two years after the bill’s date of enactment. It also restricts access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.

While H.R. 1 includes several provisions benefiting the biofuel and bioenergy industries, it also aims to repeal and scale back numerous other clean energy tax credits, including the clean hydrogen tax credit and the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit.

The alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for advanced refueling property placed in service during a give tax year, including property used to dispense E85, biodiesel blends of B20 or greater, natural gas, hydrogen, propane, and electricity. The credit value is 30% of the cost of the property, up to $100,000. The credit is currently scheduled to retire on Dec. 31, 2032. The draft bill would accelerate the sunset date of the credit to Dec. 31, 2025.

Also related to biofuels, H.R. 1 aims to repeal Section 60108 of Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which allocated funding to the U.S. EPA to support certain functions related to the Renewable Fuel Standard This includes $5 million to the EPA to support the development and establishment of tests and protocols regarding the environment and public health effects of a fuel or fuel additive; perform internal and extramural data collection and analyses to regularly update applicable regulations, guidance, and procedures for determining lifecycle GHG emission of a fuel; and review, analyze and evaluate the impacts of all transportation fuels, including fuel lifecycle implications, on the general public and on low-income and disadvantaged communities and $10 million to the EPA to fund “new grants to industry and other related activities…to support investments in advanced biofuels.” . Any unobligated funds would be rescinded.

The bill also aims to terminate the clean hydrogen production tax credit, which was established by the IRA and allows taxpayers to claim a credit per kilogram of qualified clean hydrogen produced for sale or use. The credit is based on GHG emission rate of the production process, with a value of up to 60 cents per kilogram. The clean hydrogen tax credit is currently available for facilities that commence construction before Jan. 1, 2033. The draft bill would accelerate the expiration of the credit to Dec. 31, 2025.

Another section of the draft bill aims to phase-out a credit that supports the installation of residential wood heating appliances and residential oil furnace or hot water boilers that are rated to be fueled with eligible biobased fuels. The legislation would terminate the energy efficient home improvement credit, which currently allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for household energy efficiency improvements. The value of the credit is 30% of qualified expenses, up to $1,200 annually, or $2,000 for heat pumps and biomass stoves. The credit is currently set to expire on Dec. 31, 2032. The draft bill would accelerate the expiration to Dec. 31, 2025.

In addition, the draft bill seeks to phase out the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) for clean electricity. The credits are not currently set to expire. The draft bill, however, aims to phase out the credit by reducing the value of the credit by 20% for facilities placed into service after 2029, by 40% for facilities placed into service in 2030, and 60% for facilities placed into service 2031. No credit would be available for facilities placed into service after 2031. Bill provisions also restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.

H.R. 1 will now be taken up by the Senate, where the bill will likely be amended. Any differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill will likely be resolved via conference committee with the goal of crafting a piece of legislation that can be subsequently passed by both houses of Congress. Once the House and Senate are able to pass identical versions of the bill, the legislation will be delivered to the White House for President Donald Trump’s consideration.

Representatives of the biofuel and bioenergy industries are speaking out to applaud H.R.1’s 45Z provisions.

“The budget reconciliation bill passed by the House this morning includes several provisions that are important to America’s ethanol producers and farmers,” said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association. “In addition to extending the 45Z clean fuel production credit by four years, the bill also reinstates crucial tax benefits that will stimulate research, experimentation, and innovation across the ethanol supply chain. As the bill now moves to the Senate, we hope additional improvements can be made to ensure these tax policies truly drive demand growth for American-made renewable fuels.”

“We’re grateful to our champions on Capitol Hill who have worked hard to preserve and extend rural priorities, like the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “This budget reconciliation package would give farmers and ethanol producers the freedom and flexibility to deliver for the American people. It ultimately delivers on the President’s agenda—it’s good for rural communities, good for innovation, good for investment, and good for American energy dominance,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “We urge the Senate to protect the 45Z tax credit and get this bill onto the President’s desk, so we can unlock billions of dollars of investments in new markets for farmers and U.S. clean energy innovation.""

The American Biogas Council applauded the crucial changes the bill makes regarding carbon intensity scoring for manure-based biogas projects. “We urge the Senate to follow quickly suit and pass legislation that also includes the House provisions favorable to biogas, which will accelerate the deployment of biogas systems that capture energy from organic materials like manure, food waste and wastewater solids as they break down,” said Patrick Serfass, executive director of the ABC. “These systems transform this waste into clean, American-made energy, while reducing pollution and stimulating economic growth in rural communities.

“To fully realize the potential of biogas, we also call on the Senate to extend support for biogas systems under the clean electricity (Sections 48E/45Y) and clean hydrogen (Section 45V) tax credits, which are critical for farmers, municipalities and other operators who are limited from using Section 45Z but still seek to generate renewable energy from decomposable waste,” Serfass added.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Coalition is applauding the bill’s 45Z provisions. “The SAF Coalition applauds the House of Representatives for extending the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) through 2031,” said Alison Graab, executive director of the SAF Coalition. “Sustainable aviation fuel is a vital solution for advancing U.S. energy dominance, driving rural economic growth, and establishing the United States as a global frontrunner in SAF production.

“This legislation provides the long-term certainty SAF producers need to scale operations, drive private sector investment, and benefits American farmers and rural economies,” Graab added. “The Coalition is encouraged by the extension and looks forward to the Senate’s support.”

The Advanced Biofuels Association (ABFA) is also speaking out in support of the bill’s 45Z provisions. “The advanced biofuels industry is grateful to see the House include a multi-year extension of the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) in its reconciliation package,” said Michael McAdams, president of the ABFA. “Certainty is essential for businesses to invest in the infrastructure and workforce to grow American energy dominance in the advanced biofuels space.

“We look forward to working with biofuels champions in the Senate to make additional improvements to the credit as the legislative process continues to further expand America’s advanced biofuels capacity and strengthen the nation’s energy security.”

,,2025-05-22 22:18:21+00:00,RMI,California Dreamin' on Earth Day - RMI,Colm Quinn,,,,,https://rmi.org/california-dreamin-on-earth-day/,"Project developers in California are taking advantage of this policy environment, with over 60 industrial decarbonization projects announced across the state.
Unlocking first-of-a-kind clean industrial projects California is an economic powerhouse responsible for more than 14 percent of US GDP.
At the event, we heard directly from leaders advancing real-world industrial decarbonization projects.
To accelerate deployment at scale, there is a need for an ecosystem of actors working in coordination to support industrial decarbonization from multiple angles.
Industrial decarbonization has the potential to do so much more than mitigate climate change.","Why it’s golden hour for decarbonization in the Golden State.

Last month on Earth Day, RMI, Mission Possible Partnership, and the Bezos Earth Fund gathered project developers, local policy makers, NGOs, and financial institutions in downtown Los Angeles to celebrate progress and take stock of the journey ahead to decarbonize industry and heavy transportation in California.

More than 30 percent of California’s emissions come from heavy industry and heavy transport, including aviation, shipping, and heavy-duty trucks. This pollution not only contributes to smog and poor air quality, it also adds fuel to a warming planet, supercharging the extreme weather events, like wildfires and storms, that have come to plague the Golden State.

The good news is, California is uniquely positioned to decarbonize these sectors. The state has some of the most ambitious environmental regulations in the nation, including targets to achieve carbon neutrality and 100% clean energy by 2045. Project developers in California are taking advantage of this policy environment, with over 60 industrial decarbonization projects announced across the state. However, many announced goals and projects have not reached a final investment decision (FID) or become operational.

That made it ideal for RMI and Mission Possible Partnership, with support from the Bezos Earth Fund, to launch a clean industrial hub in California to provide technical assistance, analysis, and facilitation to directly support 10 first-of-a-kind decarbonization projects, and conduct research and host convenings to enable a broader ecosystem for project developers to be successful. To date, seven out of the ten projects, have reached final investment decision (FID), compared to just 20 percent of proposed projects globally.

At the event, we heard from local leaders who are decarbonizing shipping, ports, and drayage trucking; building first-of-a-kind (FOAK) industrial decarbonization projects; and mobilizing a broader ecosystem of enabling policy, finance, and community engagement to support decarbonization throughout California.

Decarbonizing shipping, ports, and trucking

California’s ports are critical to the state’s economy, but are also significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution. The Port of Los Angeles is the nation’s busiest container port, moving more than 8 million containers in 2023. Port infrastructure, such as heavy-duty trucks, cargo ships, and material handling equipment, contributes the lion’s share of emissions at ports. As part of the California clean industrial hub, RMI and Mission Possible Partnership worked with the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to map drayage truck routes and identify the most impactful locations to install charging infrastructure to enable the fleets that serve the port to transition to zero-emission trucks.

Decarbonizing these systems is complex: goods must continue moving efficiently, yet their carbon and pollutant footprints must be significantly reduced to meet state climate targets and improve local health outcomes.​

At the convening, participants heard from leaders addressing different aspects of ports decarbonization. Paul Gioupis of Zeem Solutions, a fleet management and EV transition service provider for heavy-duty trucks, discussed the potential for electric vehicle (EV) trucking to replace diesel drayage fleets. Today, most drayage trucks run on diesel, making trucking the largest source of emissions at the Port of LA, responsible for 43 percent of its emissions in 2022. Fleets switching to EVs would significantly reduce emissions and pollutants in surrounding communities. Maggie Messerschmidt of C40 Cities illustrated the importance of collaboration across stakeholders, outlining the successful development of green shipping corridors between Los Angeles and Shanghai and Los Angeles and Singapore, coordinating decarbonization across port-to-port routes. Amber Coluso from the Port of Los Angeles’s Air Quality Team emphasized local air quality management strategies targeting reductions in PM2.5 and NOx emissions, such as electrification of cargo handling equipment.

The panelists also discussed several structural barriers that persist. Infrastructure and grid constraints, such as limited transmission capacity and long interconnection timelines, hinder the scaling of zero-emission technologies. High upfront capital costs and unclear return on investment remain barriers for private actors. Additionally, coordinating among port authorities, utilities, municipalities, trucking companies, and regulators presents challenges in aligning timelines and investment decisions.​

Nevertheless, the panelists highlighted notable advancements. Demonstration projects involving zero-emission cargo handling equipment have proven technical feasibility. Green shipping corridor initiatives are moving from concept to implementation, particularly where strong bilateral port agreements exist. Early electric truck deployments are achieving high utilization rates at charging depots, reinforcing the business case for continued investment in electrification.​

While historically ports have been part of the problem, today the ports and respective cities managing them are leading on solutions and have become key actors enabling decarbonization projects in the shipping and trucking sectors. California is showing that it’s not only a leader in renewables, but a blueprint for other coastal communities worldwide working to maintain a robust economy built around global trade while increasing the health and prosperity of local residents.

Unlocking first-of-a-kind clean industrial projects

California is an economic powerhouse responsible for more than 14 percent of US GDP. The state boasts a thriving industrial sector: refineries, trucks, airports, ports, and other industries are major drivers of the economy, but are responsible for 80 million metric tons of CO2 per year, making California the third-largest industrial emitter in the nation. Project developers, with more than 60 announced projects, are working to decarbonize California’s industrial sector, which will require moving beyond announcements to implementation. Without a significant increase in operating projects, especially in sectors like cement, fuels, and industrial heat, California risks missing its 2045 net-zero target.

The Greater Los Angeles area, home to roughly half the state’s population, hosts many of the proposed decarbonization projects across heavy industry and heavy transport, from the truck charging terminals discussed above to cement plant decarbonization to sustainable aviation fuel production. At the event, we heard directly from leaders advancing real-world industrial decarbonization projects. Steve Regis, COO of CalPortland, the largest cement and construction materials producer in the western United States, shared the company’s work to reduce emissions from cement production, a sector responsible for 10 percent of industrial CO₂ in California. Josh Stolaroff of Mote, a clean hydrogen start-up based in California, described their approach to producing carbon-negative hydrogen from biomass waste. Mote recently closed a $7 million Series A funding round, and aims to produce 20,000 tons of low-emissions hydrogen annually while removing and sequestering 350,000 tons of CO2 per year. Corey Stewart, of RMI’s aviation team, highlighted the path forward for scaling sustainable aviation fuel and other FOAK fuel technologies, and Felix Hennebert from Rondo Energy discussed thermal battery systems as a solution to electrify industrial heat and reduce both operating costs and emissions for heat-intensive production processes.

Despite their varied technologies and sectors, these innovative companies are encountering a common set of challenges. Complex and often delayed permitting processes can stall even well-prepared projects. FOAK technologies carry perceived commercialization risks, making it difficult to attract private investment at scale. High capital costs, especially when combined with limited revenue certainty, remain a key barrier to moving from pilot to full deployment.

Still, momentum is building. California’s public funding programs, including state grants, federal support through the Inflation Reduction Act, and clean hydrogen hub initiatives, are catalyzing FOAK projects and helping de-risk early investment. The state’s strong regulatory framework, such as clean energy and zero-emission fuel mandates, is sending long-term signals that support early adoption. And some technologies, such as electrified kilns or zero-emission fuels, are beginning to move beyond the lab and into commercial settings.

The clean industrial hubs model plays a key role in overcoming these barriers. By providing technical assistance, convening stakeholders, and supporting project developers as they navigate complex permitting and financing landscapes, the hubs model helps ensure that more FOAK projects move from concept to construction.

Creating the enabling ecosystem: policy, finance, community engagement

Decarbonization projects don’t exist in isolation. Even the most promising technologies can stall without the right enabling environment. Today, many developers still face the challenge of acting in a vacuum: pushing projects forward without the necessary policy clarity, financial backing, or community trust. To accelerate deployment at scale, there is a need for an ecosystem of actors working in coordination to support industrial decarbonization from multiple angles.

The panelists at the convening spoke about how to mobilize the broader ecosystem of policy, finance, and community engagement. Daniel Adomian of California’s Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank discussed how state financing mechanisms can help derisk capital for early-stage projects.

Carmelita Miller, a leader in energy equity, emphasized the integral role communities play in project development. Carmelita spoke to the need for clean industrial development to have early, sustained collaboration with frontline communities, not as a procedural box-check, but as essential partners in shaping projects that deliver durable, equitable benefits. This approach both creates a win-win situation and ensures projects move forward rather than stall out through opposition.

Sean Knierim of Side Porch, a consulting firm specializing in designing and implementing social impact strategies through cross-sector collaboration, spoke about the importance of grounding decarbonization projects in community partnerships that go beyond compliance to build true shared value.

Michelle Kinman, of the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI), discussed how LACI’s Transportation Electrification Partnership has fostered public-private collaboration to create an investment blueprint for zero-emission truck charging infrastructure, integrating community input to guide equitable deployment.

Several pain points emerged from their discussion. Fragmented and sometimes misaligned policy signals, across jurisdictions and agencies, can slow or confuse investment decisions. Investors and lenders often view FOAK and community-based projects as risky or unproven, making it difficult to secure financing. And traditional approaches to community engagement remain transactional, too often treating communities as stakeholders to manage rather than partners to empower.

The conversation also surfaced what’s working. Strategic philanthropic funding is being used to fill early-stage gaps: supporting planning, permitting, and ecosystem coordination. Labor and community organizations are stepping in as true project partners, offering critical insights and accelerating local acceptance. And perhaps most importantly, cross-sector collaboration, across finance, government, industry, and civil society, is becoming the norm rather than the exception in leading projects.

What’s ahead

Looking out to 2030, hundreds of zero-emissions projects will need to be developed in California to meet state — and global — climate targets. RMI and Mission Possible Partnership’s work creating clean industrial hubs of first-of-a-kind projects and enabling ecosystems to unlock industrial decarbonization at scale is a critical piece of the puzzle.

Industrial decarbonization has the potential to do so much more than mitigate climate change. It is an opportunity to clean up air quality, leading to improved health in our neighborhoods, lower healthcare costs, and less strain on medical resources. It can bring tangible benefits to impacted communities like jobs and funding for schools through novel community benefits agreements. And it can help better steward our natural resources, so the beaches, forests, and wildlife so many Californians love are there for future generations.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iStock-1647949123-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 18:57:03.507306

Long-Term Benefits The biggest difference between fossil diesel and renewable diesel is the raw materials used.
As a leading producer of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, Neste’s renewable diesel can typically deliver above 60%, even up to 75% less GHG emissions over its life cycle compared to fossil diesel.
Furthermore, as a drop-in fuel, renewable diesel works in all types of diesel engines without requiring any modifications to current infrastructure.
While manufacturers continuously improve engines, renewable fuel producers are exploring the next generation of raw materials to produce renewable diesel.","For some who don’t believe in technology neutrality and favor hydrogen or electric vehicles, renewable fuels are often described as bridge fuels, transition fuels or stopgaps. However, several major car manufacturers are scaling back on their ambitious EV production targets, which highlights the challenges and complexities of transitioning to a sustainable transportation system. There is no silver bullet to reduce all the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within the transportation industry, and we need to leverage all the possible solutions to fight against climate change. As a drop-in solution that works for all types of diesel engines, renewable diesel is already well positioned to be a significant player in the long-term energy landscape.

Long-Term Benefits

The biggest difference between fossil diesel and renewable diesel is the raw materials used. Fossil diesel is derived from crude oil, which accelerates climate change, while renewable diesel is produced from 100% renewable raw materials, even from waste and residue materials such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. Hydrotreatment technology specially adapted for processing renewable materials allows carbon molecules that already exist in the environment to be used over and over again to create renewable diesel, which means that their combustion in engines does not release any new carbon into the atmosphere. The proprietary NEXBTL technology allows Neste to turn a wide variety of low-quality raw materials into premium-quality renewable products. In 2024, waste and residue materials accounted for 90% of Neste’s total renewable material inputs.

As a leading producer of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, Neste’s renewable diesel can typically deliver above 60%, even up to 75% less GHG emissions over its life cycle compared to fossil diesel. Furthermore, as a drop-in fuel, renewable diesel works in all types of diesel engines without requiring any modifications to current infrastructure. For fleet operators, the switch to renewable diesel can immediately cut the carbon footprint of their fleet without costly investment in new equipment or interruptions to business.

Neste has produced renewable diesel since 2007 and began selling it in the United States in 2012. Over the past decade, Neste has observed an increase in the consumption of renewable diesel globally as well as in the U.S., mainly driven by two factors: businesses adopting lower-GHG-emission goals and more sustainable solutions to demonstrate commitment to sustainability, as well as supportive policy frameworks like low carbon fuel standard frameworks in states like California, Oregon, Washington and New Mexico that help promote the use of renewable diesel.

Applications Beyond Road Transportation

Today, renewable diesel is primarily used to reduce GHG emissions from on-highway transportation. However, it is also poised to play a significant role in decarbonizing other heavy-duty segments, such as construction, mining and power generation. These harder-to-decarbonize industries rely heavily on fossil fuels for their operations and lack immediate solutions, such as electrification, to achieve net-zero emissions.

For the construction sector, renewable diesel can power heavy machinery and equipment, reducing emissions from excavation, materials handling and transportation within construction sites. Neste’s partnership with Power Engineering, a construction company specializing in heavy-civil and marine construction, is a good example. Enabled by one of Neste’s fuel distributors, Diesel Direct, Power Engineering transitioned its entire harbor craft marine fuel supply and land-based equipment fleet to run on Neste’s renewable diesel in 2023. In just one year, the switch to renewable diesel helped Power Engineering reduce up to 470 tons of GHG emissions and enabled the company to be compliant with dynamic regulations while maintaining operational performance.

For the mining industry, renewable diesel can be used in mining vehicles, blast operations, haul trucks and more to reduce its climate impact. For power generation, renewable diesel can serve as a cleaner fuel source for backup generators and remote power systems, ensuring that critical infrastructure can remain in operation during outages. In Finland and Singapore, respectively, Neste has helped data center operators Verne and ST Telemedia Global Data Centres transition to renewable diesel to power their backup generators.

The adoption of renewable diesel in these off-highway applications is crucial for achieving broader decarbonization goals and transitioning toward a more sustainable future. While road transportation has been a primary focus for GHG emissions reductions, renewable diesel offers a viable solution for decarbonizing these hard-to-abate sectors and complements other solutions that are in early stages of development.

Internal Combustion Engines and Liquid Biofuels

According to a recent research study commissioned by the Engine Technology Forum for heavy-duty vehicles, internal combustion engine (ICE) technology will power one-third to one-half of the new vehicle fleet in 2032. Presently, the few battery-powered and hydrogen-fueled vehicles available typically deliver shorter ranges than ICE engines. Most modern EVs offer a range of over 250 miles on a full charge, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles can typically offer a driving range of 300 to 400 miles on a full tank of hydrogen. Multiple OEMs are developing hydrogen internal combustion engines (hydrogen ICE). According to Cummins, it has debuted two hydrogen ICE concept trucks, and the heavy-duty truck is expected to have an operating range of more than 500 miles. However, as of 2024, there are only 54 hydrogen stations in the U.S., with most of them in California. While waiting for the numbers of hydrogen vehicles and stations to grow, ICE manufacturers are continuously working to make the next generation of diesel engines combust more efficiently and reduce emissions more significantly.

While manufacturers continuously improve engines, renewable fuel producers are exploring the next generation of raw materials to produce renewable diesel. Currently, hydrotreatment is the most common process employed by commercial fuel producers, with animal fats, used cooking oil and vegetable oils being among the most common raw materials. However, these materials alone are not sufficient to meet long-term forecasted demand. To continue driving innovation, producers like Neste are working to develop technologies that can diversify supply with new, scalable materials, such as novel vegetable oils produced with regenerative farming practices and lignocellulosic waste and residue materials. Novel vegetable oils refer to renewable raw materials produced using regenerative agricultural practices that help restore soil health and increase farm productivity. For example, in early 2025, Neste signed a memorandum of understanding with Bayer that aims to develop a winter canola ecosystem in the U.S. Winter canola not only has the potential to be a lower-carbon-intensity raw material, but can also bring additional environmental benefits to cropping systems. Once they become scalable, these raw materials can play a crucial role in meeting the growing global demand for renewable products.

Renewable diesel is readily available at scale, and it can deliver immediate GHG emissions reduction for road transportation as well as a variety of heavy-duty industries. For all these reasons, it is evident that renewable diesel is not just a bridging solution, but will continue to play a vital role in the future energy mix for decades to come. We need all the available solutions to fight climate change, and renewable diesel enables us to take actions today to help transportation and heavy-duty industries operate with reduced emissions.

Meanwhile, maritime programs, such as the FuelEU Maritime Regulation, are expected to drive RD demand, but feedstock competition and infrastructure gaps remain.","As global efforts to decarbonize aviation and ground transport accelerate, the urgency to grow the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acid (HEFA)-based renewable diesel (RD) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) business has never been greater. Yet, for producers and developers of such projects, one of the biggest barriers to growth isn’t infrastructure—it’s sourcing consistent, traceable feedstock and complying with complex and evolving regulations.

Despite these challenges, demand for SAF in the U.S. continues to climb. The market’s momentum underscores a growing urgency to overcome feedstock and compliance challenges. In February 2025, U.S. domestic demand for SAF was five times higher than the average monthly demand in 2024, as reflected in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s D4 renewable identification number (RIN) generation data. (Figure 1)

This surge in demand reflects more than just market enthusiasm—it signals a critical juncture for SAF and RD developers. As the industry scales, the ability to align innovative project concepts with the realities of feedstock availability and regulatory expectations becomes a defining factor in long-term viability.

The Feedstock Challenge

To reach a final investment decision, SAF and RD project developers need long-term feedstock security. However, this is often complicated by geography. SAF and RD feedstocks such as used cooking oil (UCO), tallow, soybean oil and canola are often not produced in the same regions where the finished fuels are consumed. For example, UCO is often collected in densely populated urban centers or imported from Asia, whereas SAF production and consumption are frequently concentrated near airports or coastal hubs. This disconnect raises costs and increases lifecycle carbon intensity (CI), which can make it difficult to participate in credit programs like California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard and similar state and provincial programs.

Technology flexibility adds another layer of investment costs. While most SAF-capable facilities can also produce RD, the reverse is often the case, requiring additional processing infrastructure. As SAF demand grows due to airline decarbonization targets and environmental, sustainability and governance reporting, production flexibility—the ability to switch between RD and SAF—is becoming a strategic advantage for developers. However, adding SAF capacity to an existing RD facility adds capital expenditure and operational expenditure.

Traceability and Compliance Risks

As feedstock values rise, so does the risk of fraud. For example, regulatory programs in the European Union and United Kingdom restrict or cap many virgin oil feedstocks and create an incentive for UCO fraud in major UCO exporting countries. In some cases, suppliers may fry a single item in virgin oil and falsely label it as UCO to qualify for compliance programs. This not only undermines compliance integrity and increases scrutiny from regulators, but it also disincentivizes the proper end-of-life treatment of materials, as economic pressure favors labeling waste streams as renewable feedstocks, regardless of origin. Feedstock traceability tools that include detailed documentation of origin, transportation and chemical analysis are now critical for maintaining regulatory alignment across jurisdictions.

Recent cases underscore the risk. In Norway, for example, retroactive credit callbacks were issued when imported tallow failed to meet compliance standards. These events signal the growing need for robust chain-of-custody systems and strict supplier verification.

Aligning Facility Design with Feedstock Geography

Regional advantages must drive feedstock decisions. Tallow is abundant in cattle-producing regions like Texas, Montana and Brazil. UCO thrives in countries with high rates of deep-frying, particularly across Asia. Woody biomass and agricultural residues are prevalent in the Pacific Northwest and southeastern U.S. Eschewing regional logic in favor of convenience often leads to high CI scores and lower credit values.

Furthermore, transportation emissions, energy inputs and process efficiency can impact the CI score of the fuel. Therefore, facility siting decisions should also reflect access to both feedstock and low-carbon energy inputs.

Timing is Everything

In one recent case, a production facility was built and feedstock secured, only for the company to realize that EPA pathway approval would take nine months to a year to complete. Early engagement with federal and state regulators, as well as third-party advisors with regulatory and compliance expertise, is essential to run in parallel to engineering, procurement and front-end planning stages. This approach sets investors and stakeholders on a path to realizing long-term value creation for their RD and SAF investment.

It is also important for SAF and RD developers to work backward from their targeted start date, identifying milestones for life-cycle assessment modeling, feedstock validation and tax credit registration and compliance.

US, EU Policy Picture

Meanwhile, policy uncertainty continues to hamper progress. In the U.S., SAF and RD producers are awaiting further guidance on the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit under the Inflation Reduction Act. Without it, revenue modeling and investment decisions remain speculative. Meanwhile, the expiration of the Section 40B tax credit and uncertainty surrounding the import treatment of feedstocks, such as tallow, further complicate the market.

In the EU, mandates under ReFuelEU Aviation, part of the “Fit for 55” package, require increasing volumes of SAF in aviation fuel starting in 2025, with targets rising steadily to 2050. It is worth noting that in the EU, the amount of UCO feedstock that can contribute to the Renewable Energy Directive is capped at 1.7% in the road transport sector, but it is not capped in aviation fuel mandates. Meanwhile, maritime programs, such as the FuelEU Maritime Regulation, are expected to drive RD demand, but feedstock competition and infrastructure gaps remain. Globally, a unified SAF credit and traceability system is lacking, forcing producers and airlines to juggle multiple compliance frameworks with differing definitions and requirements.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Figure1_04c56c1451.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 15:56:24.996750

“But without a stable domestic ethanol base, one promising route for British SAF production will struggle to take off,” the executives said.
“Any change in future US bioethanol availability could then leave the UK with serious fuel security issues if our industry has already closed,” the group added.
The UK began importing significantly more US ethanol after adopting the E10 fuel standard (up to 10% ethanol) in September 2021.","The UK’s domestic bioethanol industry is warning of severe consequences following a new trade agreement with the United States that removes a 19% tariff on imported US bioethanol. Industry leaders say the move, announced on May 8, threatens to undercut local production and could lead to the closure of the country’s two remaining bioethanol plants, reports Fastmarkets.

Vivergo, based in Saltend near Hull, and Ensus, located in Teesside, produce around 840 million liters of bioethanol annually — enough to meet 95% of the UK’s current petrol requirements, based on a 5.5% blend rate. If petrol blending increased to 10%, these plants would still supply around half of the demand, according to the Renewable Transport Fuel Association (RTFA).

Executives from ABF Sugar, which owns Vivergo, and Crop Energies, which owns Ensus, have publicly condemned the tariff removal. In a joint statement issued on May 11, they warned that the policy could force both plants to shut down, saying, “This vital sector is now facing imminent collapse because of the trade deal… In our current situation, we will have to close these plants.”

They also pointed out that both facilities are capable of producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through an alcohol-to-jet pathway — a key part of the UK government’s decarbonisation strategy. The government’s SAF mandate, signed into law in late 2024, requires jet fuel to include 2% SAF by 2025, rising to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

“But without a stable domestic ethanol base, one promising route for British SAF production will struggle to take off,” the executives said.

The RTFA also raised concerns about the wider economic fallout, particularly for agriculture. Vivergo is a major buyer of feed wheat in northeast England, and its closure could significantly impact local farmers. The plant also produces animal feed, offering a home-grown alternative to imported soya-based products.

“The decision has major repercussions not just for the staff at the two large UK bioethanol plants who now face a very uncertain future, but for the wider supply chains that these plants support,” the RTFA said in a social media post on May 12.

The RTFA further warned that if domestic ethanol production shuts down, the UK will have to rely entirely on imported bioethanol to meet fuel standards, which require petrol to contain at least 5.5% ethanol.

“Any change in future US bioethanol availability could then leave the UK with serious fuel security issues if our industry has already closed,” the group added.

The UK began importing significantly more US ethanol after adopting the E10 fuel standard (up to 10% ethanol) in September 2021. By 2024, US imports made up nearly half of all bioethanol supplied in the UK — 701 million liters, or 48.6% of the total, according to provisional government data.

That’s up from 626 million liters in 2023 (44.5%) and 343 million liters in 2022 (27.6%). The trend reflects the growing role of US ethanol in the UK market since the country left the EU and its former trade protections, including anti-dumping duties on US ethanol.

Ensus, which uses corn as its main feedstock, has faced production cuts in recent years due to poor margins. Its parent company, Crop Energies, announced in 2023 a €100 million investment plan to improve profitability and reduce emissions at the facility. However, the new trade deal casts uncertainty over those plans.

Meanwhile, Vivergo, which also uses sugar as a feedstock, has had inconsistent output in recent years but was nearing full production capacity in 2022, according to AB Sugar.

With domestic producers under pressure and rising reliance on imported ethanol, stakeholders are urging the government to reconsider the trade deal’s implications before long-term damage is done to a sector they say is vital to both the environment and the economy.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-6.png,N,,2025-05-22 14:56:50.219066

The challenges of green cement It’s not just a Microsoft problem.
Sublime will start delivering on its deal with Microsoft when its first 30,000-ton commercial plant is operational.
For this deal with Microsoft, other customers who buy Sublime’s cement won’t be able to lay claim to its environmental benefits, Ellis said.","(Bloomberg) — Microsoft Corp. is partnering with Sublime Systems to reduce its indirect greenhouse gas emissions through a first-of-a-kind deal to buy low-carbon cement products from the startup.

Under the contract, Microsoft can purchase up to 622,500 metric tons of Sublime’s cement over a period of six to nine years. Microsoft can claim the carbon reductions associated with that cement in its own emissions accounting, even if it doesn’t use the material itself. If Microsoft passes on buying the product, the Somerville, Massachusetts-based Sublime can sell it to local buyers but the software giant still gets to claim the carbon savings.

Sublime uses an electrochemical process that eliminates limestone, which is cement’s main ingredient and releases carbon dioxide when it’s heated up and broken down.

Microsoft’s push to build more data centers supporting artificial intelligence has driven the company further away from its goal of becoming carbon-negative by 2030. That AI expansion has helped boost the tech giant’s emissions by 30% since 2020. More than 96% of the company’s emissions are Scope 3, or indirect, and materials like cement used in data center construction make up a big share of them.

It’s Microsoft’s first time doing a deal like this for building materials, though the company and others have used the same approach for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable energy. Called an environmental attribute certificate, it allows the purchasing company to make a sustainability claim based on environmentally friendly goods – like clean jet fuel, renewable electricity or low-carbon cement – that it didn’t use directly. But these certificates often promise more than they deliver, research shows.

“Our priority, first and foremost, is always buying and installing low-carbon materials physically that are already on the market today,” said Katie Ross, Microsoft’s director of carbon reduction strategy and market development. “But the challenge is they don’t exist at the scale or in all of the locations that we need to procure today.”

The companies declined to say how much the deal is worth.

The challenges of green cement

It’s not just a Microsoft problem. Although cement accounts for about 8% of global emissions, it’s hard to decarbonize partly because construction is a risk-averse industry with thin margins and high safety standards, according to Nik Sawe, a senior policy analyst in the industry program at Energy Innovation Policy and Technology LLC, an energy and climate think tank. That means construction companies have been reluctant to take up cement alternatives developed by startups, which are cleaner but also currently more expensive and untested in the real world.

At its 250-ton-per-year pilot plant in Somerville, Sublime has reduced emissions by 90% compared to traditional cement, according to Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Leah Ellis. Sublime will start delivering on its deal with Microsoft when its first 30,000-ton commercial plant is operational. It’s slated to be completed in 2027.

Cement is heavy, and transporting it over long distances doesn’t make sense economically, Ellis said. The deal allows Microsoft to support the scale-up of Sublime’s technology even if it doesn’t have a construction project near the startup’s plant, she added.

Do environmental attribute certificates work?

In the past, some of these certificates have supported renewable projects that would have been developed anyway, meaning they didn’t help bring additional wind and solar online as promised, studies show. Microsoft has said it plans to phase out its use of unbundled renewable energy certificates in future years.

If deals like the one the company signed with Sublime proliferate, the clean cement industry will need to prove that the certificates it is offering are verifiable and avoid carbon emissions that manufacturers would have generated otherwise, according to a 2024 report on structuring demand for lower-carbon materials co-published by RMI and Microsoft. That includes ensuring that the products’ environmental benefits aren’t double-counted, or claimed by multiple entities as a reduction on their emissions ledger.

“Checks must be in place along the way to increase confidence that every purchase of a certificate will deliver its expected outcome,” the report’s authors wrote.

For this deal with Microsoft, other customers who buy Sublime’s cement won’t be able to lay claim to its environmental benefits, Ellis said.

On Thursday, the FTSE 250 company said it would sell its catalyst technologies division to American rival Honeywell, the sprawling industrial conglomerate.

On Thursday, the FTSE 250 company said it would sell its catalyst technologies division to American rival Honeywell, the sprawling industrial conglomerate.

The offloaded division includes the company’s interests in biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and bioethanol, as well as “blue” hydrogen which is produced using natural gas.

SAF has been touted by the aviation industry as the best way to reduce global carbon emissions from flying, but last year demand was just two thirds of what had been predicted.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has blamed lacklustre demand for SAF, which is more expensive than traditional jet fuel, on “mixed signals” about its adoption coming from governments around the world.

The expected growth of the market for SAF was used by Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, to support the expansion of Heathrow Airport.

“A lot has changed in aviation, and sustainable aviation and economic growth go hand-in-hand,” she said in January.

The sale comes as Liam Condon, the Johnson Matthey chief executive, faces pressure from the company’s biggest backer, Standard Industries, to rapidly turn around the business. It follows accusations that he and the rest of the board have “destroyed shareholder value” through poor investments.

Demand for SAF has proved disappointing, according to airlines, with the IATA saying that just 1m tonnes was produced last year compared to forecasts of 1.5m tonnes.

Mr Condon said: “We will now fundamentally reshape Johnson Matthey into a more focused and leaner business.”

He added: “JM is a great company and we are confident that the actions we have announced today will deliver substantial and sustainable value to our shareholders.”

Airlines claim they are keen to adopt the greener SAF but have been reluctant to pass the costs on to customers through air fares, instead arguing for governments to subsidise production to make the product cheaper.

Johnson Matthey said the sale would deliver a large cash boost while leaving the main business more “streamlined”.

The company is holding on to its “clean air” business, which primarily makes catalytic converters, as well as a platinum metals group division that is working on technologies related to “green” hydrogen including electrolysers and fuel cells.

Johnson Matthey’s talks with Honeywell about a potential deal for its catalytic technologies division are understood to have taken place on and off since before Standard joined the shareholder register in 2022, though the deal will still be seen as a defensive measure.

It came as the company reported an 11pc drop in sales and virtually flat profits, at £263m for the year to March 31. Johnson Matthey blamed “challenging” global conditions, including cuts to production by car makers that use its catalytic converters.

It also warned of a “slowdown in the energy transition” which had hit demand for green hydrogen technologies.

In the long-term, the company is betting that demand will continue for catalytic converters, primarily from larger vehicles that are difficult to decarbonise, even as governments encourage consumers to switch to electric cars.

On Thursday, it said that the internal combustion engine’s lifespan also looked longer than previously thought, due to slower-than-expected demand for electric vehicles and government policies that will continue to allow some hybrids to be sold.

The company added: “Over the past three years, we have seen a global slowdown in battery electric vehicle penetration and the regulatory environment has also supported internal combustion engine longevity.”

Along with cars, the company said it also saw opportunities in the rapidly growing data centre market, as demand surges for back-up generators which also use catalytic converters, as well as direct air capture of carbon dioxide.

Its platinum-based metals business, which refines key materials used in converters, is meanwhile hoping to tap into growing demand for metals recycling and future demand for hydrogen.

The division also refines metals for the pharmaceutical, defence and agricultural industries.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2025/05/22/TELEMMGLPICT000345989197_17479077260880_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-05-22 14:56:56.893158

Whether they make airplanes, cars, tractors or trains, manufacturers are working to minimize their carbon impact and that of their products.

Newsweek partnered with Plant-A Insights Group and GIST Impact to launch a ranking of America's Greenest Companies 2025, recognizing companies committed to reducing their environmental impact in key areas like greenhouse gas emissions, water management and waste reduction. Transportation industry leaders, including Boeing, John Deere, Cognizant Technology Solutions, BorgWarner and CSX, made the list.

Beyond the ranking, Newsweek dove into the latest sustainability reports issued by some of the highest-rated transportation companies to see how they're tackling efforts to green their businesses and learn about the latest trends in the industry.

Supporting Sustainability Goals of Brands They Supply

The airline industry is actively adapting to a greener business environment. A key component of that is the use of airplane-specific biofuels, called Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The fuel type is created using renewable or waste products and can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Boeing will be building airplanes that are 100 percent SAF-compatible by 2030. Boeing will build airplanes that are 100 percent SAF-compatible by 2030. That year is significant as it's the self-imposed deadline Delta Air Lines has set to ensure 10 percent of its fuel is SAF. Both Delta and United Airlines have set the goal of having zero-emissions fleets by 2050. Currently, just 0.1 percent of United's overall fuel used is SAF.

Boeing, Airbus, Dassault Aviation, GE Aerospace, RTX's Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce and Safran are part of the International Aerospace Environmental Group's Working Group 13 (WG13), a group assigned to study the impact of 100-percent use of SAFs on aviation systems.

With Boeing leading the group, WG13 will coordinate SAF testing efforts, recommend best practices and study the switchover to 100 percent SAF, working with key stakeholders like airports and fuel suppliers to investigate what support is necessary as the industry moves toward a zero-emissions future.

Developing Greener Products

For some companies, having more sustainable product manufacturing processes isn't enough. They are going further, developing products that make the world around them more sustainable as well.

While physical products are still vital parts of John Deere's business, the company's technology footprint has been growing over the last decade, amounting to everything from autonomous drive systems for tractors in the fields to precision grading technology utilized to build roadways of the future.

A recent John Deere collaboration with Sonoma County Winegrowers trialed Smart Apply, a precision spray technology that utilizes precision data to allow farmers to more precisely apply chemicals and water, greatly reducing chemical runoff, airborne drift and water waste.

The partnership results showed cost savings related to fewer materials used and efficiency gains.

Using Technology to Find Areas of Potential Impact

Cognizant Technology Solutions has a vast portfolio of products. Among them are sustainability advisory services and solutions, a tailor-made approach to helping businesses achieve their green goals.

The company's digital stack includes machine learning, data mining, digital twins and robotic automation. This makes a company's business operations more easily trackable, leading to the discovery of opportunities for efficiencies and greening throughout all aspects of the business environment, including product cycles and supply chains.

In the transportation industry, Cognizant's technology can be used to assist fleet operators. Through the company's artificial intelligence-enabled data and analytics digital footprint, those operators can manage fleet use to enable fleet decarbonization.

Investing in Green Transportation Solutions of the Future

One of the auto industry's top Tier 1 suppliers, BorgWarner, has shifted its business portfolio toward eco-friendly transportation solutions of the future. The company's 2024 Sustainability Report lays out the goal of maintaining the majority of its revenue from electric vehicle and emissions-reducing products.

While the supplier currently offers a number of internal combustion powertrain-related products, including turbochargers, all-wheel drive units, engine control units and intakes, it is also developing and manufacturing inverters, thermal management systems, electric drive motors and battery systems that are used in hybrid and battery-electric vehicles.

Driving the company's goal toward being a carbon neutral company by 2035 is a portfolio of products in development that further that agenda. For example, next-generation battery packs are expected to be more efficient and have longer lives.

The company is also investing in its workforce. BorgWarner's ""Power to Evolve"" program retrains its engineers who have worked on internal combustion engine components to work on electrified vehicle products like inverters, batteries and electric motors.

Testing New, Cleaner Fuel Solutions

In April 2024, CSX debuted its first hydrogen-powered locomotive, just one year after it announced it would collaborate with Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) on the technology. CSX adapted an existing diesel locomotive to run the hydrogen fuel cell technology using a conversion kit developed by CPKC.

Ultimately, CSX plans to build 20 of the units and deploy them concurrently for a one-year period, collecting data that can be analyzed to determine the feasibility of the fuel for widespread use.

CSX isn't alone. Sierra Northern Railway recently completed its first successful test of a hydrogen-powered switcher and plans to continue testing the technology through the end of 2027.

The deployment of the sustainable aviation fuel initiative addresses the global call for decarbonisation, with the potential to reduce life cycle carbon emissions by about 80 per cent compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel.

Also, it can power aircraft engines without modification, making it an immediate and viable solution for greener air travel and also mitigating the environmental impact on the aviation industry.

Event

In line with that, a two-day high-level workshop for aviation industry stakeholders to build capacity to drive progress towards sustainable aviation practices has been organised in Accra by the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), in collaboration with the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

Participants include key national stakeholders from the aviation, energy, agriculture and environment sectors.

Adoption

The Minister of Transport, Joseph Bukari Nikpe, in a speech read on his behalf by the Deputy Minister of Food and Agriculture, John Dumelo, said the production and adoption of aviation fuels required a clear understanding of the nation’s potential, policy frameworks, technical capabilities and investment opportunities.

He said Ghana had already developed the National Energy Transition Plan (2022-2070), which establishes a comprehensive framework to effectively support the country in fulfilling its commitments as outlined in the nationally determined contributions (NDCs).

The minister said the plan recognised the inherent unsustainability of the current energy landscape and the challenges it presents.

“It, therefore, draws a pathway to achieving a net-zero emission future for Ghana’s development and aspirations.

“We aim, among others, to establish policies and regulatory environments to support sustainable aviation and cleaner energies and also develop a clear roadmap and action plans for national SAF deployment in Ghana,” he added.

Beneficiaries

The Deputy Director-General in charge of Finance and Administration at GCAA, Juliet Okae, said Ghana was one of the countries selected to benefit from the feasibility studies.

“SAF can be produced from feedstock, used cooking oil and other waste materials.

There is a huge potential for Ghana to create jobs in line with the government's agenda to create opportunities for the youth and promote economic development in a sustainable way,” she said.

The Project Coordinator at ICAO Office of Environment, Cesar Velarde, said sustainable aviation fuel presented opportunities not only in the environment sector but also for economic growth and development.

“The workshop is a kick-off of a six-month technical assistance project which would include a feasibility study by working closely with GCAA and national stakeholders to establish the materials that are appropriate for SAF,” he added.",https://www.graphic.com.gh/images/2025/may/22/Dumelo.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 14:57:11.662556

The initial 8,000-gallon delivery, completed on May 12, 2025, marks a significant milestone in broadening the accessibility of SAF in a new region of the United States.

This milestone makes Overland Aviation the first FBO in the Midwest to receive a delivery of SAF through Avfuel’s network. The announcement comes just ahead of the 2025 European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (EBACE) in Geneva, where sustainability and innovation are expected to be key themes.

“We’re proud to help lead the charge in introducing SAF to the Midwest,” said Tanner Overland, president and founder of Overland Aviation. “Our goal is to provide world-class services that support a more sustainable future for aviation—this special fuel load is an important milestone in that commitment.”

Overland Aviation is known for delivering premium, globally oriented services to both domestic and international travelers. Its capabilities include on-site U.S. Customs and Border Protection clearance, 30-minute quick turns, full-service ground handling, aircraft maintenance, and FAA Part 135 air charter operations. The addition of SAF to its fuel offerings enhances its commitment to efficiency, safety, and sustainability.

The SAF delivery was made possible by a supply agreement between Avfuel and Valero Marketing and Supply Co., a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corp. The fuel itself was produced by Diamond Green Diesel LLC, a joint venture between a Valero affiliate and an affiliate of Darling Ingredients Inc.

The SAF was manufactured using the HEFA SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene) process. This method uses renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil and other lipids, resulting in a cleaner fuel alternative that can significantly reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. When used in its neat form, SAF can cut emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. When blended at a 30/70 ratio with traditional jet fuel, it can still reduce emissions by approximately 24%.

“This announcement represents an exciting step forward in expanding SAF availability and accessibility across the United States,” said Joel Hirst, senior vice president of sales at Avfuel. “We were thrilled to work with Overland Aviation to showcase the viability of SAF’s expansion into the Midwest while offering the FBO’s global customer base a more environmentally responsible fueling option.”

As aviation continues to evolve toward more sustainable practices, this strategic collaboration reflects a broader industry commitment to reducing environmental impact.

Market signal to SAF industry: FedEx reinforces demand for low-emissions aviation solutions, spotlighting the need for industry-wide scale-up.

FedEx has launched its most significant U.S. deployment of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), securing over three million gallons of blended SAF from Neste for use at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

The agreement, which spans a one-year period, marks a milestone for both companies—and the air cargo sector—as FedEx commits to using fuel that contains at least 30% neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel. This SAF purchase will account for nearly 20% of FedEx’s annual jet fuel consumption at LAX, making it the largest SAF procurement by a U.S. cargo airline at the airport to date.

“Procuring SAF is an important component of our aviation emissions-reduction strategy in the coming years, and we are pleased to have executed a deal with Neste to begin using this fuel in our air operations,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, Chief Sustainability Officer and VP of Environmental Affairs at FedEx.

The deal underscores FedEx’s broader environmental strategy, which includes aircraft fleet modernization, flight planning optimization, and ongoing fuel conservation efforts. These initiatives enabled the company to reach a 30% reduction in aviation emissions intensity by fiscal year 2024—meeting a goal it first set in 2008.

“As the world’s preeminent express transportation company, our initial U.S. deployment of this fuel advances our sustainability goals and bolsters the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF,” said Richard Smith, COO, International, and CEO, Airline, FedEx. “While we know further growth of the SAF market is needed—alongside other innovations—we are proud to celebrate this milestone with our world-class air network.”

Neste, the SAF supplier, emphasized the strategic importance of the deal for global decarbonization in air logistics.

“FedEx is demonstrating how this industry can leverage available lower-emission solutions like SAF to reduce its environmental impact. We look forward to further strengthening our cooperation,” said Carl Nyberg, Senior VP, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste.

This move builds on a history of collaboration between FedEx and industry partners to pioneer sustainable aviation solutions—including the 2018 ecoDemonstrator test flight with Boeing, which marked the first commercial airplane flight powered by 100% SAF in both engines.

This article explores why SAF is fast becoming the cornerstone of aviation decarbonisation, how it links into the broader renewable energy ecosystem, and what makes it a compelling opportunity for strategic investors.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a next-generation substitute for conventional jet kerosene. Produced from feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues and forestry waste, SAF delivers a substantial reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Crucially, it functions seamlessly with current aircraft engines and fuelling infrastructure, making it a rare clean energy solution that requires no immediate capital overhaul. Although global usage remains limited today, SAF is now scaling faster than any other aviation fuel alternative.

The aviation industry contributes approximately 2% of global CO₂ emissions. Unlike other sectors, it cannot decarbonise rapidly through electrification. SAF steps in as a tangible solution for existing fleets, avoiding the decades-long wait for hydrogen or electric aircraft to become mainstream. Government initiatives are supporting this shift with ambitious targets and funding programmes that back both supply and demand growth, creating a solid foundation for industry-wide adoption.

Challenges remain, particularly around feedstock availability and production costs. Today’s SAF is typically more expensive to produce than fossil jet fuel, but innovations are narrowing that gap. New feedstock sources, from wet waste to woody biomass, are expanding the supply base. At the same time, technological advances such as alcohol-to-jet and power-to-liquid fuels are pushing the boundaries of efficiency and scalability.

The trajectory is steep but promising. SAF production is forecast to more than double by the end of the decade, with a growing number of commercial-scale facilities under construction worldwide. As volumes rise, economies of scale and regulatory support are expected to compress costs and drive broader adoption. Policy incentives, including tax credits, carbon pricing mechanisms and fuel mandates, are already stimulating investment and improving profitability across the SAF value chain.

Feedstock innovation is particularly exciting. Novel production pathways using renewable electricity and captured CO₂ offer ultra-low carbon intensity, while avoiding food-versus-fuel debates. These approaches are still emerging but are backed by robust investment, setting the stage for commercial breakthroughs in the next five to ten years. The result is a dynamic environment where multiple SAF technologies are converging to create a flexible, resilient and sustainable fuel network.

For investors, SAF is more than a green fuel, it is a strategic position in the future of aviation and energy infrastructure. The opportunity spans early equity stakes in production facilities, partnerships with logistics providers, and participation in emerging carbon offset platforms. As long-term supply agreements between airlines and fuel producers become more common, investor visibility and confidence are increasing.

Market risks remain, price volatility, regulatory shifts and execution complexity must be managed. Yet, with growing demand, supportive policy frameworks and expanding technological options, SAF is uniquely positioned as a scalable, investable solution aligned with net-zero goals. The next phase of growth will favour those who move early, capitalise on innovation and align with partners building long-term SAF capacity.",https://www.directorstalkinterviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Avation-plc.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 13:57:29.458066

It will use a new form of environmental credits related to that purchase to claim emissions reductions related to data center construction.

Under the deal, announced May 22, Microsoft will claim 622,500 metric tons of emissions reductions over a six-to-nine-year period against its Scope 3 footprint — which accounted for 96.5 percent of the technology company’s total footprint in its 2023 fiscal year.

For perspective, Microsoft used 605,000 carbon credits that year to make its carbon neutral claim. It has also purchased credits for close to 20 million tons of carbon removal.

Microsoft plans to use Sublime’s cement in data centers, infrastructure and offices wherever geographically possible. Most cement is used within a few hundred miles of where it is produced.

Microsoft’s footprint rose 31 percent between 2020 and 2024, largely because of data center expansion. Concrete and steel are carbon-intensive materials that together contribute 13 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. With much ado being made about the huge energy appetite of data centers that fuel artificial intelligence, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are all seeking ways to address their construction-related emissions.

Sublime uses an electrochemical process instead of a combustion-driven kiln to manufacture a replacement for ordinary portland cement. The company, spun out of research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has raised $200 million. That includes funding from venture capital firms including The Engine, Lowercarbon Capital and Energy Impact Partners, along with an $87 million award by the Department of Energy in 2024 — funding that so far has not been affected by the Trump administration’s shifting priorities.

“We see a big opportunity to both domesticate and modernize U.S. cement making,” said Sublime CEO and Co-founder Leah Ellis. The U.S. imports more than 20 percent of its cement, and Sublime’s technology could change that locus. Two factories in the Northeast have closed in the past 18 months because of outdated technologies.

Microsoft is the anchor customer for Sublime’s first commercial facility being built in Holyoke, Massachusetts, slated to begin deliveries in 2028. One of the biggest construction companies in the Northeast, Suffolk, announced a $3 million investment on May 21 to buy cement from the factory.

“Sublime’s mission is no less than fundamentally reshaping a cornerstone of the global built environment landscape, and we are proud to support them through our capital, our network and our commitment to building a more sustainable world,” said Jit Kee Chin, executive vice president and chief technology officer for Suffolk’s investment arm, Suffolk Technologies.

Credits for low-carbon cement and steel

Terms of the Microsoft-Sublime deal weren’t disclosed, but the company is positioning the contract as a way to provide early demand signals for the startup’s first factory, which will produce about 30,000 tons of cement annually. “Microsoft is a market maker,” Ellis said.

Sublime’s first commercial deliveries are slated for 2028; the startup hopes to support a full-scale facility with a capacity of 1 million tons potentially by 2030, she said.

Microsoft is using a new category of environmental attribute certificate (EAC) for concrete and steel to justify its investment. The certificates are legal mechanisms companies use to calculate emissions reductions. One common type is renewable energy certificates, which many businesses use to offset emissions from purchased electricity.

Environmental attribute certificates are used to spur investments in technologies that decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors including aviation, freight rail and maritime shipping. The new ones that will be issued under the Microsoft-Sublime deal are based on a methodology Microsoft developed with carbon management consulting firm Carbon Direct.

“While we prioritize deploying physical material whenever possible, this EAC approach helps both buyers and sellers overcome geographic, supply chain, cost and other barriers that make it challenging to introduce new technologies,” said Katie Ross, director of carbon reduction strategy and market development at Microsoft.

Goal: Scale availability of low-carbon cement

Microsoft’s purchases will be independently verified, although the details of how that will happen haven’t yet been determined, said A.J. Simon, director of industrial decarbonization at Carbon Direct. The certificates will be managed by a book and claim system, similar to what’s in place for sustainable aviation fuel.

The methodology published as a guide for other companies recommends that certificates be vetted using seven criteria, such as whether purchases will complement direct procurement of steel, cement and concrete.

“The intention is to set high-integrity standards for commodity EACs that will improve confidence in this mechanism,” Simon said. “The thresholds for quality in the report reflect Microsoft’s decarbonization; other companies may decide to weight the criteria differently.”

The prepurchase commitments made possible by the EACs act as accelerants for startups, Ellis said. Despite uncertain macroeconomic conditions, Sublime isn’t making big adjustments, and it’s working closely with three of the world’s largest cement producers — Holcim, Amrize and CRH — to focus on the long term. “This isn’t an industry that pivots quickly,” Ellis said.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WS-Development_Lobby-Pour-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 13:57:33.366345

The acquisition of London-based Johnson Matthey’s catalyst unit expands the Charlotte-based tech and electronics manufacturing giant’s energy and sustainability business segment, Honeywell CEO and chairman Vimal Kapur said in a statement Thursday.

Johnson Matthey designs and manufactures catalysts for the automotive, energy and chemical industries, according to the company’s website. The catalysts remove pollutants and improve efficiency in industrial processes.

The all-cash transaction is expected to be completed within the first half of next year, pending regulatory approvals.

The deal means Honeywell will be able to offer customers “a comprehensive solution for the production of lower emission, critical fuels including sustainable methanol, sustainable aviation fuel, blue hydrogen and blue ammonia, which enhance energy security and reduce emissions,” Honeywell said.

“As demand for diversified sources of energy continues accelerating, we will better enable Honeywell to offer the innovation our customers need,” Kapur said.

Johnson Matthey’s catalyst business has about 1,900 employees in the U.S., Europe and India. Honeywell has 1,300 employees in Charlotte and nearly 100,000 workers worldwide.

We have set out below an overview of the current regulatory frameworks governing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the key jurisdictions of the UK, EU and USA.

SAF has emerged as a critical component in the global drive to decarbonise the aviation sector, a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike conventional jet fuels, SAF offers substantial reductions in lifecycle carbon emissions by incorporating renewable feedstocks and innovative production technologies.

Recognising its potential to drive sustainable growth, policymakers across the UK, EU, and USA are actively shaping regulatory frameworks to accelerate its deployment and adoption.

Note that this is an evolving regulatory landscape that is subject to change – however, this overview sets out the current regulations and initiatives of each of the UK, EU and USA – and strongly indicates the direction of travel of each of these jurisdictions.

We conclude with a comparison of these jurisdictions and analyse their strengths and limitations in fostering market growth. We also examine potential pathways for future development, including harmonisation of international standards, technological advancements, and policy synergies.

By presenting such analysis and exploring projected trends, this overview offers insights into the role of regulation in shaping the trajectory of SAF as an essential enabler of sustainable aviation.

United Kingdom

The UK SAF landscape

Current Status and Future Developments

The UK’s SAF industry is progressing rapidly, driven by a number of policy measures that integrate SAF into the UK’s broader decarbonisation goals. With increasing regulatory and financial support, the UK aims to position itself as a global leader in SAF development, production, commercialisation and use.

A key component of this strategy is the SAF Mandate, alongside other legislative and market-based incentives designed to accelerate SAF adoption. Under these principles, SAF is defined based on achieving a minimum level of greenhouse gas emission reductions and specific sustainability criteria.

The key features include the introduction of compulsory, incrementally increasing SAF supply requirements, a buy-out mechanism to enforce compliance, and funding incentives to support industry growth.

The Jet Zero Taskforce (JZT) (building on the previous Government’s Jet Zero Council) was announced by the UK Government in November 2024 to advance sustainable aviation. Members include UK Government ministers, industry leaders and academics. Established to accelerate the transition to net zero aviation by 2050, the JZT aims to streamline aviation decarbonization priorities and support the development, production, commercialisation and use of SAF in the UK and globally.

Legislation

The UK is at the forefront of SAF development as the one of the first countries in the world to legislate for mandatory SAF requirements. The UK’s key policy to decarbonize aviation and secure demand for SAF is the SAF Mandate.

SAF Mandate

Key terms (2025 onwards):

The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) Order 2024 came into force on January 1, 2025. This introduced compulsory SAF requirements for suppliers of at least 15.9 terajoules (c.468,000 litres) per year of aviation fuel to the UK: from 2025, SAF is required to make up 2% of the total UK aviation fuel mix, increasing to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

SAF suppliers earn Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates for SAF supplied to the UK that meets certain GHG emission reductions and sustainability criteria (SAF must comprise fuel that achieves minimum GHG emission reductions of 40% relative to traditional fossil fuel-based jet fuel). Evidence of the SAF supplied to UK needs to be provided to the Department for Transport to assess and award corresponding certificates. The number of certificates issued will be proportionate to the level of GHG emission reductions achieved by the fuel delivered (i.e. the greater the reductions, the greater the number of certificates issued). Suppliers can either use their certificates to demonstrate that they have complied with their obligations or trade them to other suppliers.

HEFA Caps (2027 onwards):

SAF produced through hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) can contribute 100% of SAF for the first 2 years of the Mandate and thereafter decreasing to 71% in 2030 and 35% in 2040.

This is due primarily to HEFA’s emission reduction inefficiencies (when compared to SAF alternatives) and feedstock sustainability concerns.

Power to Liquid (PtL) Obligations (2028-2040):

A separate PtL obligation requires 0.2% of UK aviation fuel to be sourced from PtL commencing in 2028 and thereafter rising to 4.4% by 2040.

PtL requires energy-derived production of aviation fuels (from e.g. green hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide).

Buy-out Mechanism (2025 onwards):

Fuel suppliers unable to meet their SAF Mandate requirements must pay a buy-out price determined by their SAF or PtL shortfall amounts.

The aim is to create a financial incentive to prioritize SAF, with the buy-out prices (currently £4.70 per litre for SAF and £5.00 per litre for PtL) being set at a level to encourage the supply of SAF over the use of the buy-out.

SAF Revenue Support

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Revenue Support Mechanism) Bill (2024) was announced in the King’s speech on 17 July 2024, proposing a revenue certainty mechanism for SAF producers investing in UK-based facilities. A number of funding options were proposed and, in January 2025, the UK Government confirmed that the Guaranteed Strike Price mechanism was the preferred option.

The Guaranteed Strike Price is envisaged to operate akin to a contract-for-difference (as utilised in the UK renewable power sector), offering price stability for UK SAF producers. The mechanism will operate through a private law contract between a UK SAF producer and a designated Government agency, establishing a strike price (being the guaranteed price the producer will receive for eligible SAF over a specified period). If the reference price surpasses the strike price, the producer reimburses the Government agency for the difference, and, if the reference price falls below the strike price, the Government agency compensates the producer for the shortfall.

In line with the “polluter pays” principle, the UK Government has confirmed that it intends for the revenue certainty mechanism to be funded by aviation fuel suppliers.

Further SAF Incentives

To further promote UK SAF development, the UK Government has implemented various financial incentives:

Advanced Fuels Fund: First launched in 2022 with £165 million of grant funding available, the Advanced Fuels Fund aims to support the establishment and development of first-of-a-kind SAF projects in the UK.

SAF Clearing House: Any new aviation fuel must meet strict specifications and undergo testing to meet industry standards; the cost and complexity of which can be a significant barrier to new fuels entering the market. The UK SAF Clearing House provides technical support and funding to SAF producers.

Furthermore, aircraft operators can reduce their obligations under the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) by using eligible SAF, which qualifies for emissions reductions under the scheme.

Projections and Insight

It is estimated that, by 2050, the global aviation industry will need approximately 400 million tonnes of SAF annually to meet international decarbonization goal and, whilst the SAF market is still in a nascent stage of its development, the UK is positioned to play a significant role in the global effort to decarbonize aviation. The development of SAF production facilities in the UK are key for the successful implementation of the UK Government’s SAF goals.

The SAF Mandate has only just come into force and the revenue certainty mechanism for SAF producers has yet to be finalized and take effect. As such it remains to be seen whether these mechanisms will be sufficient to meet international decarbonization goals and position the UK as a leader in SAF development, production, commercialisation and use:

The success of the buy-out mechanism in incentivizing the production and use of SAF will depend on the future production costs of SAF. Whilst the buyout rates are currently projected to exceed SAF production costs, if the buy-out price is set too low (for example, if production costs spiral), suppliers may choose to simply pay the buy- out price.

With respect to the revenue certainty mechanism, there are a number of questions and policy decisions that remain outstanding: what will be used as the “reference price” (unlike in the power market where there is a published market price for electricity, no such benchmark exists for SAF)? How will the strike price adjust over time? Precisely how will the mechanism be funded? At a most fundamental level, the deployment of significant capital into SAF development will require further clarity regarding the revenue certainty mechanism.

For further clarity on the information above, we set out below (at Figure 1) a timeline of key projected regulatory developments in the UK SAF market.

European Union

The EU SAF Landscape

Current Status and Future Developments

Despite efforts to curb its growth, commercial flights in the EU could rise by up to 42% by 2040 compared to 2017. Recognizing the pressing need to address the climate impact of the aviation sector, the EU has prioritized the development of a SAF market. By leveraging the collective action potential of its member states, the EU is uniquely positioned to lead in SAF implementation.

SAF is defined by the EU as a “drop-in” aviation fuel, including advanced biofuels or biofuels produced from sustainable feedstocks, recycled carbon fuels, or synthetic fuels.

With mandates introduced in 2023 and effective as from January 2025, the European Union is meticulously crafting a policy framework to stabilize the SAF market, foster innovation, and create a level playing field, driving progress toward its Fit-to-55 climate goals.

Legislation

The European regulatory framework for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been shaped by two key legislative milestones: the Renewable Energy Directives (RED) and the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation.

The RED have progressively established binding renewable energy targets across the EU, including for the transport sector, and have increasingly integrated SAF into the broader energy transition strategy. From RED I (2009), which set initial renewable energy targets, to RED II (2018), which introduced incentives for SAF, and finally RED III (2023), which reinforced sector-specific mandates, these directives have paved the way for SAF regulation.

Complementing this framework, the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, adopted in 2023, marks a decisive shift in SAF development by imposing direct obligations on fuel suppliers at EU airports. Unlike the RED directives, this regulation is immediately applicable across the EU and imposes a progressive incorporation of SAF into jet fuel, with binding quotas extending to 2050. Together, these two instruments define the roadmap for SAF deployment, balancing long-term policy incentives with immediate regulatory requirements.

RED Directives

RED served as the cornerstone for establishing the EU’s shift toward greener fuels.

Adopted on April 23, 2009, the RED I Directive introduced ambitious renewable energy targets across EU Member States:

General Targets: Each Member State was assigned a binding target to achieve 20% renewable energy in its final energy consumption by 2020. These targets varied for each country: Some countries were optimistic about their renewable energy potential and set ambitious targets, such as Sweden with 49% by 2020, Denmark with 30%, and France with 23%. Others, however, were more cautious, with the Netherlands setting a target of 14% and Italy aiming for 17%.

Transport Sector: A specific target of 10% renewable energy was set for the transport sector by 2020. This included biofuels and other renewable fuels but did not explicitly address aviation.

Impact on SAF: While RED I did not explicitly include SAF, it established a foundation for their future integration by defining sustainability criteria and promoting advanced biofuels.

Entering into force on December 11, 2018, the RED II Directive strengthened the EU’s renewable energy framework in response to increased climate ambitions:

Revised Targets: The overall binding target for emissions reduction was raised to 32%, with a renewable energy target of 14% for the transport sector.

Promotion of SAF

AdvancedBiofuelsandRFNBOs: The RED II Directive encouraged the use of advanced biofuels and Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs), explicitly including SAF. Advanced biofuels refer to biofuels produced from feedstocks that do not compete with food production or contribute to land-use changes that could negatively impact biodiversity. They are typically derived from waste and residues, or non-food crops such as algae and plant fibers. As for RFNBOs, they are fuels produced from renewable electricity rather than biological sources.

IncentiveMultipliers

Biofuels derived from feedstocks listed in Annex IX (including advanced biofuels) count twice their energy content towards renewable targets, meaning that for every unit of energy produced from these fuels, it counts as two units towards the target.

Fuels supplied to the aviation sector (including RFNBOs) count as 1.2 times their energy content, meaning that for every unit of energy from these fuels, it counts as 1.2 units toward the target.

Limitations on Food-Based Biofuels: These are capped at 7% to mitigate adverse effects on land use and food production.

Adopted on October 18, 2023, the RED III Directive was a decisive step towards integrating SAF into the EU’s energy framework, by:

Enhanced Targets: The share of renewable energy in the EU’s overall energy consumption must reach 42.5% by 2030, with a binding target of 29% for the transport sector.

Sectoral Sub-Targets: Specific targets were introduced for advanced biofuels and RFNBOs, solidifying SAF’s role as a cornerstone of aviation decarbonization.

Aviation Catalyst: RED III emphasized increased SAF integration into national energy strategies while supporting emerging technologies, such as synthetic fuels.

Directives are legal acts that generally need be transposed into national law by EU member states, meaning that each country must adopt its own legislation to achieve the directive’s objectives. Therefore, the RED directives’ provisions need to be transposed into national law. There is generally an 18-month deadline for member states to do so, with an occasionally shorter deadline for some provisions.

Member States successfully met the RED I targets, despite varying national goals, demonstrating the EU’s commitment to renewable energy. This progress laid the foundation for the more ambitious targets in RED II and RED III, and Member States are on track to achieve these goals. In particular, the push for SAF under these directives is progressing well, with ongoing efforts to scale production and expand infrastructure. While challenges remain, Member States are well- positioned to meet the targets for both renewable energy and SAF by 2030, especially with the introduction of the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation.

ReFuelEU Aviation regulation

Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of October 18, 2023 through ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport (ReFuelEU Aviation) represents a cornerstone of the EU’s strategy to decarbonize aviation in line with the Green Deal objectives and the Fit-for-55 package. This regulation establishes a comprehensive legal framework to accelerate the adoption of SAF across the EU.

Finalized in 2023, most of its provisions entered into force on 1 January 2024, with Articles 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 becoming applicable from January 1, 2025. As an EU regulation, ReFuelEU Aviation is directly applicable in all Member States without requiring transposition into national law.

The regulation imposes binding SAF blending obligations on aviation fuel suppliers, requiring them to progressively integrate SAF into the aviation fuel supplied at EU airports. The mandated SAF share begins at 2% in 2025 and will increase incrementally to 70% by 2050, of which a dedicated sub-target for synthetic aviation fuels starts at 0.7% in 2030, reaching 35% by 2050 (see Figure 2). For instance, the goal for 2040 is to achieve a 42% share of SAF in the aviation fuel supplied to EU airports, with 15% of that being synthetic.

To be eligible, SAF must comply with the sustainability and emissions reduction criteria set out in RED I. Acceptable SAF sources include advanced biofuels, synthetic fuels derived from renewable hydrogen, and recycled carbon aviation fuels. Fuel suppliers may also utilize hydrogen for direct aircraft propulsion or synthetic low-carbon fuels.

Within this regulatory framework, synthetic fuels—particularly e-kerosene—are set to play an increasingly prominent role, with a specific mandate ensuring their integration into the fuel mix.

EU airport operators are required to facilitate access to SAF, while aviation fuel suppliers, airports, and aircraft operators must systematically collect and report data to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and national competent authorities to ensure regulatory compliance.

The regulation further establishes enforcement mechanisms, designating national competent authorities responsible for supervision. Fuel suppliers failing to meet their SAF blending obligations will face financial penalties and must compensate for any shortfall by supplying the missing volume the following year.

By setting clear, long-term SAF quotas through 2050, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation creates a stable and predictable market framework, reinforcing the EU’s ambition to achieve a more sustainable aviation sector.

Incentives for SAF Production and Innovation

The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and Financial Incentives for SAF

In addition to the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, the EU’s climate strategy for the aviation sector is reinforced by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), established under Directive 2003/87/EC. As a “cap-and-trade” mechanism, the EU ETS aims to progressively reduce greenhouse gas emissions by setting a cap on total emissions while allowing market- based trading of emission allowances. Initially, free allowances were allocated to aircraft operators based on the average emission of the sector and their historical performance. In 2023, approximately 22.5 million aviation allowances were allocated for free, while about 5.7 million were auctioned.

To accelerate decarbonization, the EU has initiated a phased reduction of free emission allowances for aircraft operators:

In 2024, free allowances were reduced by 25%;

In 2025, they will be further cut by 50%;

By 2026, all free allowances will be phased out, requiring operators to fully cover their emissions through auctioning.

This transition is designed to incentivize the adoption of SAF, as airlines can lower their compliance costs by integrating SAF into their fuel mix. To support this shift, the EU has introduced targeted financial incentives within the EU ETS framework:

A dedicated SAF allowance mechanism provides 20 million allowances (valued at approximately €1.7 billion) until 2030, rewarding aircraft operators based on SAF usage. This mechanism helps bridge the price gap between conventional aviation fuel and SAF. SAF remains significantly more expensive to produce. However, by reducing compliance costs for airlines under the EU ETS, it makes SAF adoption more financially viable, supporting the transition to cleaner aviation fuels while maintaining competitiveness in the sector.

SAF that meets RED sustainability criteria is attributed zero emissions under the EU ETS, reducing the number of allowances airlines must purchase.

Beyond emissions trading, the EU has also introduced monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) measures for non-CO₂ aviation effects, with additional policy proposals expected by 2028.

Financial Support Mechanisms for SAF Development

Recognizing the financial and technological challenges associated with SAF production, the EU has established several funding instruments to support research, innovation, and large-scale deployment:

EU Innovation Fund (EUIF): A €40 billion fund aimed at de-risking SAF production across various technology readiness levels. For example, the Innovation Fund awarded in 2023 a €167 million grant to the Biorefinery Östrand project, which seeks to develop, construct, and operate the world’s first large-scale biorefinery dedicated to producing renewable SAF and naphtha, in Östrand, Sweden.

Horizon Europe: The EU’s flagship €95.5 billion research and innovation program, which funds SAF-related projects.

InvestEU: A €26.2 billion initiative supporting sustainable infrastructure investments, including SAF production facilities. One of the most notable projects funded by InvestEU is the INERATEC synthetic fuel production facility in Frankfurt. Backed by a €70 million investment, this initiative is supported by a €40 million venture loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and a €30 million non-repayable grant from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. The funding will help develop Europe’s largest carbon-neutral synthetic fuel plant, set to open in 2025.

Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking: A €1.7 billion public-private partnership between the European Commission and the aeronautics industry to accelerate the development of new aviation technologies.

Projections and Insight

While the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation establishes a robust framework and clear mandates for SAF adoption, several policy areas will require further clarification and potential amendments. The regulation’s overall timeline is generally aligned with industry expectations, but additional interventions may be necessary to ensure a smooth and effective implementation:

Penalty enforcement and cost volatility: The current penalty mechanism for suppliers failing to meet SAF quotas is directly tied to SAF costs, which remain highly volatile due to potential supply shortages. If SAF prices surge, penalties could become unsustainable, adding financial pressure on suppliers while delaying compliance. Additionally, without a price cap mechanism, rising SAF costs could impact air travel affordability, potentially triggering public and industry backlash.

Exploring a tradable SAF system: Under Article 15 of ReFuelEU, the European Commission is mandated to assess additional measures to enhance SAF market liquidity and ensure supply stability. One key consideration is the creation of a book-and-claim system, which would enable fuel suppliers and aircraft operators to purchase SAF credits and allocate them flexibly across EU airports. As of January 2025, the Commission’s report on these measures remains pending.

Beyond regulatory refinements, the political landscape in the EU is evolving, with recent electoral shifts favoring parties historically opposed to Green Deal policies. As EU policymakers shift their focus toward an Industrial Deal, maintaining strong momentum for SAF adoption will be critical. Ensuring a stable regulatory environment and continued financial support will be essential to securing the long-term success of SAF integration within the aviation sector.

The effectiveness of SAF regulations in the EU stems from the fact that they are binding, compelling operators to take immediate action and enhance their performance.

Despite its relatively high cost, airlines and operators are eager to contribute and even exceed their obligated SAF targets as early as possible. They understand that this is the only way to assert themselves in the market and to ensure the long- term sustainability and viability of the industry, which must adapt to greener practices to secure its future.

United States of America

The U.S. SAF Landscape

Current Status and Future Developments

Aviation represents roughly 3.3% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and jet fuel consumption is forecasted to increase by 2-3% annually through to 2050. This obviously presents significant opportunities for SAF investment, and the market has responded: projects have been announced in recent years that are projected to meet over 10% of U.S. jet fuel demand. Nonetheless, the biggest challenge SAF faces in the U.S. is that it is not cost-competitive with fossil jet fuel. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, SAF currently costs two to ten times more than fossil jet fuel. Consequently, the federal and state incentives discussed in this section are playing and will continue to play a critical role in the growth of SAF in the U.S.

Federal Support for SAF

The U.S. government supports SAF development in several ways: annual renewable fuel regulatory mandates; tax policy; and grants. Several of these incentives are in flux, however, given the shift in the balance of political power in the U.S. Congress and the White House.

Regulatory Mandates:

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issues annual regulations under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program that require the national pool of transportation fuel to contain a certain percentage of alternative fuels such as SAF. Production and use of biofuels under these mandates is tracked using a system of tradeable credits (Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs). Among other requirements, eligible SAF must have lifecycle GHG emissions that are at least 50% below a 2005 fossil fuel baseline.

Although compliance with the program’s mandates falls on fossil fuel producers and importers, RINs implicitly subsidize biofuels such as SAF. Depending upon the feedstock and production process, SAF can generate RINs that may be used to meet the biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel or cellulosic biofuel mandates and value of the RIN varies by type. RINs generated by producing SAF can be “stacked” with federal tax credits for SAF, such as those provided by the 2022 IRA, as well as state credits relevant to SAF.

Tax Policy:

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) has a significant impact on the SAF market in the U.S. by offering comprehensive support to encourage the production and adoption of this fuel. Instead of setting mandates, the IRA offers SAF credits for qualified neat fuels and provides grants for SAF production and distribution.

The IRA supports SAF through two credits. First, IRA created a new SAF blender’s tax credit under Internal Revenue Code section 40B, available through to the end of 2024. Then, from January 1, 2025 through to December 31, 2027, the IRA made available a new technology neutral production credit for clean fuels including SAF, the section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit.

The section 45Z credit provides a tax credit for the production of clean fuels that are “suitable for use in a highway vehicle or aircraft” and meet a specified threshold for emissions reductions. The credit is worth up to $1.00 per gallon for transportation fuels and $1.75 or more per gallon for SAF, provided that prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met. The 45Z credit is claimed by the producers of SAF, rather than the blenders, but can be transferred or sold to third parties as a means of monetizing the credit.

Since August 2022, significant work has been done by a multi-disciplinary task force including the U.S. Treasury, the IRS, the Energy Department, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the White House to implement the section 45Z credit and publish tax guidance. Most recently, on January 10, 2025, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released Notice 2025-10 and Notice 2025-11, establishing an intent to propose regulations and clarifying annual emissions rates for the credit. At the same time, the 119th Congress is currently reviewing tax legislation that may include revisions to several clean energy tax credits established by the IRA, including section 45Z. As a result, airlines, SAF producers, and conventional energy companies are queuing up to talk to Congress and Trump tax officials about the future of federal tax support for clean fuels, since the current production credit is set to expire at the end of 2027.

Grants:

IRA Section 40007 establishes a grant program for eligible U.S. entities involved in SAF production, transportation, blending, or storage, administered by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through the Fueling Aviation’s Sustainable Transition (FAST) grants program.

Section 324 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for 2023 allows the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to pilot SAF usage, with a plan to be implemented by FY2028, while permitting waivers under certain conditions.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023 and 2024 authorize discretionary grants for airport infrastructure that supports SAF’s distribution and storage, provided they meet the 50% lifecycle GHG reduction requirement.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Energy for America program also provides grants and loan guarantees to rural businesses and agricultural producers for renewable energy projects, including SAF production facilities.

State Incentives for SAF Production and Innovation

State-level policies further support SAF production and consumption by allowing producers to generate and sell credits to fossil jet fuel suppliers. In 2009, California established the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) to reduce transportation sector GHG emissions in the state and develop a range of low- carbon and renewable alternatives to reduce petroleum dependency. This market-based program sets an annual average carbon intensity (CI) benchmark for all fuels – fossil and renewable – produced or imported into the state. Fuels with a CI below the benchmark (such as eligible SAF) generate credits that producers can sell to other fuel producers in the state as a revenue stream. Oregon, Washington, and New Mexico have adopted similar fuel programs.

In other states – Illinois, Minnesota, and Nebraska – per-gallon SAF production tax credits promote SAF alignment with national objectives.

Projections and Insight

By 2030, domestic SAF production is expected to reach 3 billion gallons annually – a 130-fold increase from 2030 consumption. By 2050, production could rise to 35 billion gallons per year, reflecting a 12-fold increase from the 2030 target.

The shift towards SAF represents a long-term transition in the aviation industry. Given the international nature of air travel, SAF is a clean fuel whose market drivers are largely insulated from the political swings of the US; and American airlines and airports will need to access this fuel to comply with global emissions standards. Driven by discretionary grants from the FAA, significant investments in airport infrastructure for SAF distribution and storage are anticipated. This could lead to an improved supply chain and logistics, facilitating broader SAF availability at major airports by 2025. Increased funding through grants and tax credits may accelerate research and development of new SAF feedstocks and production technologies, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs. This could also lead to advancements in alternative feedstocks, potentially doubling production efficiency by 2030. As government initiatives and incentives ramp up, it is likely that the market share of SAF in total jet fuel consumption will increase significantly from the current less than 0.1%. Projections estimate reaching 5 -10% market share by 2030, depending on regulatory support and industry adoption.

The incentives enacted under the IRA constitute a good beginning in establishing the support necessary for overcoming barriers to SAF adoption. With investors comparing the short three-year timeline of the IRA’s section 45Z clean fuel production credit to ten-year timelines for other clean energy technologies, producers and airlines are making a long-term legislative extension of the credit a top priority for 2025. State level initiatives, like the California LCFS program, look to play a critical role in driving SAF adoption. Other states may follow suit, creating a patchwork of supportive policies that could incentivize producers while also fostering competition among states for SAF leadership.

Conclusion: Comparative Analysis of SAF

Regulatory Frameworks in the UK, EU, and US

The regulatory approaches adopted by the UK, EU, and US to promote SAF reflect distinct policy priorities, economic

structures, and aviation market dynamics. Whilst all three jurisdictions recognize the need to scale SAF production to achieve net-zero aviation emissions, their methods for incentivization, mandate enforcement, and industry engagement exhibit some notable divergences.

Key Similarities

Despite differences in policy mechanisms, several overarching themes emerge across all three jurisdictions:

Mandatory Blending Requirements: The UK, EU, and US each employ a mix of blending mandates and incentives to encourage SAF adoption. The UK’s SAF Mandate (starting at 2% in 2025 and increasing to 22% by 2040) aligns with the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which also begins at 2% in 2025 but escalates to 70% by 2050. Although the US lacks a direct federal blending mandate, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and state-level Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) programs create market-driven demand for SAF.

Financial Incentives: Each jurisdiction incorporates financial incentives to lower SAF’s production costs and bridge the price gap with fossil-based jet fuel. The UK’s proposed Revenue Support Mechanism, the EU’s SAF Allowance Mechanism under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), and the US’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits all aim to de-risk SAF investment. Notably, the US offers the most aggressive tax-based support via the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which directly rewards SAF producers.

Technology-Specific Targets: Recognizing the need for diversification in SAF production pathways, the UK and EU establish dedicated quotas for Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels and synthetic fuels, whereas the US allows greater flexibility in feedstocks, as seen in its Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and LCFS programs. The UK’s PtL obligation has similar aims to the EU’s sub-target for synthetic fuels, indicating a shared commitment to emerging technologies.

Market-Based Compliance Mechanisms: Each jurisdiction incorporates a credit trading system to enhance compliance flexibility. The UK’s Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs), the EU’s ETS allowances and (if to be applied) book-and-claim system, and the US’s RIN (Renewable Identification Number) market under the RFS facilitate compliance while stimulating a secondary market for SAF credits.

Key Differences

Despite these similarities, the jurisdictions differ in several key respects:

Direct v Market-Based Approach:

The EU and UK impose direct mandates on fuel suppliers, ensuring binding obligations for SAF blending. The UK’s buy-out mechanism acts as a penalty for non-compliance, while the EU enforces fines and requires compensation for missed SAF quotas.

The US primarily relies on market-driven incentives, with no direct SAF blending mandate at the federal level. Instead, state-based programs such as California’s LCFS and financial incentives like the IRA credits encourage voluntary SAF adoption.

Policy Longevity and Stability:

The EU offers the longest regulatory certainty, with ReFuelEU Aviation’s SAF mandates extending to 2050. The UK’s SAF Mandate provides clarity through 2040 but leaves open questions regarding future expansion.

The US approach is, potentially, more politically vulnerable. The IRA’s Section 45Z tax credit is set to expire by the end of 2027, raising questions about long-term investor confidence. This contrasts with the EU’s more predictable long-term regulatory trajectory.

Scope of SAF Eligibility and Feedstock Restrictions

The UK and EU impose stricter sustainability criteria, progressively limiting HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) (or similar) feedstock eligibility. The UK caps HEFA at 92% by 2027, declining to 35% by 2040, while the EU limits food-based biofuels to prevent indirect land-use impacts.

The US allows broader feedstock eligibility, including corn ethanol-derived alcohol-to-jet SAF, which the EU explicitly excludes. This reflects the political influence of the US agricultural sector, leading to a pragmatic approach to scaling SAF production with available resources.

Enforcement Mechanisms and Market Oversight

The EU employs oversight through the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and national regulatory bodies, ensuring strict compliance through direct penalties. The UK SAF Mandate will be administered by the UK’s Department for Transport and will be responsible for enforcing the scheme with power to revoke certificates or issue civil penalties.

The US relies on tax compliance mechanisms and voluntary participation in state-based LCFS (or similar) markets, which, as an incentive-driven approach results inleading to comparatively less stringent enforcement as can be expected in the EU and UK.

Comparative Insights and Future Implications

Each jurisdiction’s SAF strategy reflects its unique regulatory philosophy and economic priorities. The EU’s highly structured, mandate-driven approach aims to achieve rapid SAF integration but places cost burdens on fuel suppliers and buyers. The UK’s hybrid model, combining mandates with revenue support mechanisms, seeks to balance regulatory certainty with investment incentives. Meanwhile, the US favors a market-driven, incentive-based model, fostering innovation but opening up potential regulatory uncertainty due to shifting political landscapes.

This evolving landscape reflects a multi-faceted approach, balancing stringent emissions reduction targets with mechanisms that incentivise investment and production. The UK has introduced ambitious mandates within its Jet Zero strategy, while the EU’s Fit-to-55 package integrates SAF quotas through the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative.

Meanwhile, the USA leverages tax credits and grant programs under initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act to stimulate domestic SAF production. These diverse regulatory tools aim to address the significant challenges of scaling SAF, including high production costs, limited feedstock availability, and infrastructure constraints.

Looking ahead, international policy harmonization will be critical to ensuring the global scalability of SAF. The International Civil Aviation Organization and industry stakeholders may push for greater alignment between EU- style mandates and US-style incentives, potentially influencing future SAF policies. Additionally, ongoing bilateral agreements between the UK, EU, and US on carbon accounting, emissions reporting, and SAF certification will play a crucial role in fostering a globally integrated SAF market.

Despite their differences, the UK, EU, and US share the common goal of scaling SAF production to enable a net zero aviation future. While their paths to achieving this differ, their collective efforts will be instrumental in driving the technological and economic transformation needed for sustainable aviation. As regulatory frameworks evolve, continued cross-border collaboration and policy adjustments will be essential to maximizing SAF’s impact on global decarbonization goals.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.9762_2059.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 14:57:26.354044

SAF is also an important part of a strategy for developing a circular, green, and sustainable economy,"" he said.

At the event, representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, aviation enterprises, airport service operators, and petroleum businesses discussed adaptation capacity, assessed the level of impact on economic efficiency and competitiveness by using SAF, participating in CORSIA; scale and demand for SAF use in Vietnam; the ability to supply and produce SAF among domestic petroleum enterprises; and support policies to encourage the production, business, and distribution of SAF.

The DPM assigned the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam to complete a dossier and report to the Ministry of Construction (MoC) to submit to the competent authority for approval.

Domestic petroleum production and processing enterprises were asked to draw up plans to develop SAF production, including technology, land, tax, finance, and market assessment to ensure efficiency and avoid internal competition.

The Vietnam Airports Corporation will coordinate with aviation fuel suppliers to review and develop storage infrastructure, pipelines, and SAF fuel filling systems at major international airports.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Environment shall preside over and coordinate with relevant parties to develop a legal framework for the carbon market, implement a carbon credit exchange mechanism, and recognise the aviation industry's emission calculation method in accordance with ICAO standards.

He also directed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to study the fee collection mechanism for international flights departing from Vietnam; tax policies and financial support to encourage the development of the domestic SAF market; limit the export of raw materials for domestic SAF production; coordinate with the ICAO and the European Union in the negotiation process to ensure unity and harmonization of common standards;

According to a report by the MoC, SAF is produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, animal fat, agricultural by-products, urban waste, and others that have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to traditional jet fuel (Jet A-1). SAF can be blended with Jet A-1 and used directly for existing aircraft without changing technical infrastructure.

At present, Vietnamese airlines are adapting to the EU's SAF regulations when operating flights to this bloc. They are preparing to participate in CORSIA according to the ICAO roadmap.

Karen Walker:

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Window Seat, our Aviation Week Air Transport podcast. I'm ATW and Aviation Week Network Air Transport Editor-in-Chief Karen Walker. Delighted to welcome you on board. Now, joining me today are three of my editor colleagues. They are ATW Europe and Middle East Editor Alan Dron, who is based in London, ATW and Routes Senior Editor Aaron Karp, and CAPA Senior Analyst Americas Lori Ranson. Aaron and Lori, like me, are based in the Washington, D.C. area, so a big welcome to everyone. Thank you for joining me today. Our discussion is going to focus on two big air transport industry topics, safety and sustainability. Think about it as the two S's, and more specifically, how the approaches and priorities towards air transport safety and sustainability by governments and agencies either side of the Atlantic have shifted this year.

In the U.S. there was a fatal collision in January between an Army helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet that was on final approach to Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. There have also been multiple near-miss accidents involving airliners at or over major U.S. airports. This month, the new Trump administration announced big and urgent plans to modernize the country's air traffic management system. New DOT Secretary Sean Duffy has also announced a plan for New York Newark Airport, that saw three ATC system outages in April and May. Newark, Duffy said, has become a top priority for new ATC equipment and modernization and reorganization. While that work gets underway, airlines are being asked to cut the numbers of flights in and out of the busy New Jersey airport, which is also a hub for United Airlines.

Over in Europe, the air traffic management coordinator, Eurocontrol, has warned of a potentially bad summer of air traffic congestion and delays unless urgent action is taken, which presumably will also mean cutting flights. In the UK, meanwhile, hundreds of airline industry and fuel experts gathered in May at a Sustainable Skies Summit in Farnborough to discuss the increasingly uncertain likelihood of the global air transport industry meeting its goal of being carbon net zero by 2050.

Why are these things linked? Well, in my opinion, the swerve toward maintaining or restoring safety in the skies has become the number one topic this year when it comes to commercial aviation, and that I think has implications for how much focus, investment and research will go into aviation sustainability, which of course is also a huge topic. I think there's a practicality and inevitability that when there are two big problems, air travel safety and air travel sustainability, with both being very complicated and expensive tasks, safety will obviously win.

With that, Aaron, let me start with you. Timelines for the U.S. DOT plan for ATC modernization in general and for Newark in particular are vague, but Secretary Duffy has referred a lot to the 2025 to 2028 window in general and to now in Newark. Is that realistic?

Aaron Karp:

In a word, I would say no. First of all, there's a real money issue here. In the Biden administration's last budget proposal, they proposed 8 billion over five years for ATC modernization, and you mentioned the word vague. There's been a lot of vagueness about how much this is going to cost, and the estimate being thrown out there is about 12.5 billion. You can see that there would be a significant increase needed, but I think there's a lot of feeling out there that it's a lot more than 12.5 billion. Congress is right now wrangling with a budget bill, and they're going to put or have said that they're going to put ATC modernization in there, but we'll see. I think that that's the problem and has always been the problem with ATC modernization, is that they have to rely on funding from Congress and a procurement process for technology and that sort of thing.

I think there's a structural issue. We've talked before on this podcast about how the FAA has an inherent conflict of interest, in that they both regulate and operate the ATC system. There's been debates for a year about ATC privatization and going to a model more like, say, Canada or the UK, where Canada has Nav Canada operating air traffic control and also doing a lot of innovative things, in fact developing their own technology that they often then sell to the rest of the world. Then Transport Canada regulates it. There's a division there and one can focus on the operation, one can focus on the regulation, and you get a lot of the bureaucracy out of ATC and ATC is able to function on a more consistent monetary timeline.

I think, also in terms of the structural issues, there's been a lot of talk about equipment and modernizing the equipment. The average age of an ATC tower in the United States is 40 years. The average age of an en route center is 62 years. The FAA has said ... and this is a quote ... that these facilities have functioned beyond their intended lifespans. In some sense you're talking about having to, if you really want to modernize the system, rebuilding these facilities or significantly modernizing them, because there's a lot of maintenance issues that are constantly cropping up just because of the age.

The last thing I would say is that air traffic control technology moves faster than often the ability to modernize it. You come up with a system in, say, 2015, and you do the procurement and you install it, and then by the time you install it, there's new technology out there. The thing that air traffic control providers are really trying to move towards is something called trajectory-based operations, or TBO, which would mean that the airplane, from the moment it taxis from the gate at one airport to the moment it lands at the other airport, is constantly sending information to air traffic control, so the people in the tower are not just getting the aircraft just before it's coming into their airspace.

They're getting information the whole way, and so they can say, long before the airplane gets to the airport, ""Change your route a little bit here, avoid this weather there."" That would create significant efficiencies, but that's something that's still being worked on. That would require equipment in airliners. It's an ongoing process, and even if you do everything you can, even if they achieve everything they can, they won't have fixed some of the underlying problem, not just in the U.S., in the world, that air traffic control is very reactive rather than predictive. That reactive nature inevitably leads to inefficiencies.

Karen Walker:

There's a really good point, Aaron. Thank you. I think it's interesting that you raised about privatization. I think with this whole thing, you and I and Lori, we've heard this over and over again for so long. Secretary Duffy, with all due respect, has not. He's only just come into this world this year. I don't think there is an understanding of just the amount of bureaucracy and how slow this machine works when it comes to these things. As you say, it's not just a money thing, although the money is big. It's not really even just an equipment thing. It's how the system is managed. Right now they are 3,000 short of air traffic controllers as well, and you can't just pick people off the street and pop those into the towers and it all works. There's a lot to do. Lori, you live in the States too. What's your thoughts here, and what do you think prompted Secretary Duffy to make these announcements so soon in his tenure?

Lori Ranson:

Well, he walked into his job right as that jolting and fatal crash happened at National, and since then we've seen some other high-profile incidents, again at National and elsewhere in the U.S. airspace system. That has prompted some partisan rhetoric that the system was safer under the previous administration. Coming out, I think, with a bold plan for these ATC upgrades is in some ways a show of force to the public, that DOT is going to finally move the needle in a significant way on ATC reform. Of course, Duffy has claimed the Biden administration failed to do that.

Even without the fatal crash in January and other recent incidents, though, aviation is such a high-profile industry that working to achieve some reforms will be a major win. Also, just simply, given the major disruptions at Newark, the crash and other incidents, no action from the DOT or the FAA just makes for bad optics.

Karen Walker:

That is very true, yeah. You've got to be seen to be doing something here. Yeah, that is true. Alan, can we just turn to Europe? You're based in the UK, which used to be part of Europe, and so you have firsthand experience of the types of air traffic congestion and delays there. It amused me that Eurocontrol is putting out this warning of a potential bad summer of congestion and delays. I'm thinking, ""So what's new?"" It always is there, isn't it? We've just had the Paris Orly Airport have a big outage of its control tower, just this week. What's your perspective of what Eurocontrol is trying to do there?

Alan Dron:

Well, Karen, Eurocontrol has put forward a plan to hopefully get through the busy summer period, and that includes things like filing realistic flight plans, prioritizing the first rotation of the day and ensuring that schedules are realistic, which I have to say sounds so basic that you wouldn't really have thought those things would need to be said. I was talking to Eurocontrol yesterday and they're forecasting a 5% increase in flights this summer, but potentially a 20% increase in delays over 2024, and 2024 wasn't exactly good.

Now, to be fair to Eurocontrol, they do point out that they've been urging countries to invest in new equipment and more controllers for years, but that's the point. It's ultimately down to individual governments and ANSPs to sort out funding, and it's just not happening. Eurocontrol estimates it's 10 to 20% down on the number of air traffic controllers needed in certain countries. Not all, certain countries such as Spain, Germany, Greece, and several in the Balkans. The Spanish and Greek situation doesn't bode well for people taking Mediterranean holidays this summer. You might be advised to perhaps pack a good paperback to read while you're waiting at airports, like War and Peace perhaps.

Eurocontrol also makes the point that the war in Ukraine has made about 20% of its airspace unusable, which has led to much heavier traffic flows around that country, and countries on the periphery just haven't been staffed up to cope with displaced flows. That's fair enough. As an Airlines for Europe spokesman said to me this week, ""Well, yeah, we understand, but the war's been going on for three years now. Surely they could have worked something out by now."" Will airlines reduce summer flights this late in the game if delays become too bad? I guess the answer is only if they have absolutely no choice in the matter.

Karen Walker:

I love the point you made at the beginning there of it almost begs belief, really, how basic, the things Eurocontrol are saying that they're going to make a priority this year. You just think, ""Well, why weren't they always a priority?"" If you're talking about asking airlines to cut their schedules for this summer, that should have been done last year before they set their schedules. They've set their schedules. They've sold the tickets. It just seems again like they're just making decisions too late. It just seems like more of the same. I don't know about you, but ... it sounds like we're on the same page here ... I don't feel a lot of optimism that just because they put the warning out, that something's going to happen.

Alan Dron:

I feel you're right. I feel it could be a pretty bad summer for people trying to get around Europe this year.

Karen Walker:

Alan, I said this was about safety and sustainability. I'm going to turn back to you on sustainability, now because you were at that Sustainable Skies Summit in Farnborough just a couple of weeks back. Can you just give us a little flavor? What was the mood among speakers there and attendees, in terms of we know that there is now much more uncertainty about meeting the 2050 goal? We also know that they're putting out a lot of estimates on big numbers for costs for all of this, and now everybody's turning to safety. Did this come up in the conversation? What was the general mood, and optimism or not?

Alan Dron:

As you know, Karen ... you and I have been in enough conferences over the years ... sometimes it is not what's actually said at a conference that strikes you, it's just a gut feel. The gut feel I came away from after two days was that, as you said, there's just an awful lot of uncertainty. Uncertainty about government policy, uncertainty about government support in funding terms, uncertainty about whether the economics of sustainable aviation fuel plants are even there.

I have to say, when you have the head of sustainability at the UK regulator, the CAA, stand up and say there's a, quote, huge amount of uncertainty, close quote, as to whether the UK aviation sector will be able to hit its sustainability targets, and that it is going to be, quote, incredibly hard, close quote, to meet emission reduction targets, I think you've got problems.

You may recall, about three years ago now, the then-head of Qatar Airways, the very forthright Akbar Al Baker, rather put the cat among the pigeons when he basically said there was no way in hell that commercial aviation would meet its hopes for 2050 targets. I have to say increasingly I feel perhaps he was right.

Karen Walker:

Yeah. Sadly, I'm with you there. I concur. I think there's been a big reality check, and now it's an even bigger issue because of, like I say, this understandable switch to safety. As you say, they probably can't both be done together at the strength that they need to be done. Aaron, Lori, if I can turn back to you, IATA has often said that if the European single skies initiative was implemented ... that's a modern integrated ATM system across Europe ... the efficiencies could reduce airline emissions by as much as 12%. Presumably they'd be the same kind of metrics if the U.S. had implemented NextGen, its own ATM modernization plan, that has essentially gone nowhere. I wonder whether either of you feel that there is a potential sustainability payoff if there was ATM modernization fast-tracking on both sides of the Atlantic. Aaron, can I start with you?

Aaron Karp:

Sure. I actually think they're very related, in that if sustainable aviation fuel is going to be a challenge and is increasingly seen as unrealistic, the engine technology, I mean, if you talk to experts like at Embry-Rendell University, they'll say the jet engine has reached its ... the increasing amazing improvements in efficiency that have been made generation to generation have reached the end of the line, that you can't improve the efficiency much more. We're still dealing with the same aerodynamic airframe design.

The really realistic path for reducing emissions would be air traffic control. I think airlines could pivot, certainly, to saying this is not just a safety issue. If you want to reduce emissions, like you said, there's the 12% that they've talked about, the integrated sky. I mentioned trajectory-based operations. There's a lot of talk that that would significantly reduce emissions.

It seems to me, at least in the near term, that if you're saying that SAF is unrealistic and the technology, hydrogen technology, that sort of thing, is unrealistic, then the best way, the best realistic way to reduce emissions, would be to modernize ATC to have much more efficient flight paths. I think there is a real connection there.

Karen Walker:

Yeah, absolutely. Lori, what about you? I mean, they've known this for the longest time, or at least on the airline side they've been saying, ""We also need efficient air traffic management systems."" Is this the moment, the light bulb moment, for the governments too?

Lori Ranson:

Well, and I think airlines need to push the sustainability aspect of air traffic modernization, because it's inherent. With these new procedures, in terms of takeoff and landing procedures, airspace procedures, the aircraft just burn less fuel, far less fuel. If you can implement these procedures, your emissions are going to be cut. Your emissions are going to decrease. I don't understand why airlines don't push for the sustainability angle as well as the safety angle, because I think they're intertwined, like you said earlier.

Karen Walker:

Yeah. It makes sense, and that could be a pivot that actually would be useful. As you say, the procedures are a huge part of this, but it's also all those planes ... especially in Europe, as Alan knows ... that are doing endless circles because of congestion. They're burning fuel, aren't they? Alan?

Alan Dron:

Yeah. I just smiled to myself when you talked about implementing the equivalent of Single European Sky as a modern integrated ATM system in the United States. As you and I know, Single European Sky, well, let's just say I've seen glaciers move faster than the Single European Sky project. For non-European listeners, one of the main objects of the Single European Sky was to get rid of some of the national airspace boundaries and combine larger multinational areas into what they call functional airspace blocks.

Now, this largely simply hasn't happened, for three main reasons. Firstly, some countries frankly don't like the idea of giving up sovereignty over their airspace. Secondly, air traffic control unions are fearful of job losses. Thirdly, frankly, there's no political momentum behind it. It just never comes to the top of the things-to-do agenda. Single European Sky, I'm told it is progressing, but at a very, very slow pace. It's really not delivering the benefits that people had hoped for.

Karen Walker:

As you say. Well, the problem there, a lot of the problem anyway, part of the problem, is national thinking when they're supposed to be thinking across all of the space, the European Union, but they're not. They do like to also think of sustainability in national terms too. They all have their own ideas, but they still came around an EU mandate, if you like, when it came to sustainability. Again, maybe a light bulb could eventually go off.

Everyone, can I just finally ask, I mentioned about the increasing costs of transitioning aviation to net zero. IATA has put that at around $4.7 trillion over 30 years. If there is less financial support from governments, oil companies, investors, et cetera, who's going to pay for that? We know it can't all come down onto the airlines. They haven't got any money. The public says it wants clean flights. We're always hearing that, but will they pay higher fares for them, or will they just be happy to focus on, ""Is my flight safe,"" and not worry about sustainability as this goes forward? Lori, can I start with you on that one?

Lori Ranson:

Yeah. I would say for a lot of travelers, I think there's a disconnect between wanting to be environmentally responsible and paying higher airfare. I would just point to look at the demise of passenger carbon offsetting programs at airlines. Airlines said, ""Oh, we're going to move our focus to staff and other investments,"" but the reality is there's little uptake from the passenger side in those programs. I don't think you can pass a lot of the cost increase on to passengers.

Karen Walker:

No, I agree. The point, is it one airline's got to be the brave one to make the move, and they'll back off if all the others don't raise their fares, I think. Aaron, your thoughts?

Aaron Karp:

Well, one thing I would mention is that if we get to a point where it looks like the airlines are not going to meet their targets, you could see governments and I think you very well may see governments saying, ""We're going to reduce the number of operations that are allowed."" If that creates more scarcity, that would increase airfares in and of itself. Not being able to hit sustainability targets, especially I would think in Europe, where there's so much focus on this ... and we've already seen airports like Schiphol trying to limit flights ... if, because the airlines aren't meeting their targets, the governments mandate fewer flights, then fewer flights means higher fares. I think that there may be no way to avoid the sustainability issue.

I think in terms of airline investment, to get to a really, really efficient air traffic control system, as I said, will require equipment on planes that would be sending a lot of data to air traffic control centers. Airlines could pivot to saying, ""Well, we're going to invest money in the equipment to make the air traffic control system better, if investing in SAF is not something that is going to meet the demands."" I think it may not be so simple if governments get involved and say, ""Well, we're going to reduce the flights,"" because reducing flights by definition will raise fares.

Karen Walker:

Alan, maybe a quick last word from a European perspective?

Alan Dron:

Yeah, I'm very much with the lottery on this one. I mean, every survey that is done with passengers comes out with pretty much the same result, namely about 90% of people say, ""Oh, yes, yes, we want cleaner flights,"" and, ""Are you prepared to pay for them,"" and it goes down to maybe 5%. The number of people who actually stump up for, as you say, the offsetting schemes, is even lower. Yeah. Frankly, no. The public may want clean skies but not be prepared to pay for them, sadly.

Yeah, I think you're right. The Europeans are so used now to their ultra low-cost carriers and the really almost ridiculously cheap flights, but it gets them to where they want for their vacations, as you say, and I don't see them wanting to add a lot of cost to that to make it so-called sustainable.

British chemicals manufacturer Johnson Matthey (JM) has agreed to sell its net zero aviation fuel business for £1.8bn amid weak global demand and pressure from activist shareholders.

On Thursday, the FTSE 250 company said it would sell its catalyst technologies division to American rival Honeywell, the sprawling industrial conglomerate.

The offloaded division includes the company’s interests in biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and bioethanol, as well as “blue” hydrogen which is produced using natural gas.

SAF has been touted by the aviation industry as the best way to reduce global carbon emissions from flying, but last year demand was just two thirds of what had been predicted.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has blamed lacklustre demand for SAF, which is more expensive than traditional jet fuel, on “mixed signals” about its adoption coming from governments around the world.

The expected growth of the market for SAF was used by Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, to support the expansion of Heathrow Airport.

“A lot has changed in aviation, and sustainable aviation and economic growth go hand-in-hand,” she said in January.

The sale comes as Liam Condon, the Johnson Matthey chief executive, faces pressure from the company’s biggest backer, Standard Industries, to rapidly turn around the business. It follows accusations that he and the rest of the board have “destroyed shareholder value” through poor investments.

Demand for SAF has proved disappointing, according to airlines, with the IATA saying that just 1m tonnes was produced last year compared to forecasts of 1.5m tonnes.

Mr Condon said: “We will now fundamentally reshape Johnson Matthey into a more focused and leaner business.”

He added: “JM is a great company and we are confident that the actions we have announced today will deliver substantial and sustainable value to our shareholders.”

Airlines claim they are keen to adopt the greener SAF but have been reluctant to pass the costs on to customers through air fares, instead arguing for governments to subsidise production to make the product cheaper.

Johnson Matthey said the sale would deliver a large cash boost while leaving the main business more “streamlined”.

The company is holding on to its “clean air” business, which primarily makes catalytic converters, as well as a platinum metals group division that is working on technologies related to “green” hydrogen including electrolysers and fuel cells.

Johnson Matthey’s talks with Honeywell about a potential deal for its catalytic technologies division are understood to have taken place on and off since before Standard joined the shareholder register in 2022, though the deal will still be seen as a defensive measure.

It came as the company reported an 11pc drop in sales and virtually flat profits, at £263m for the year to March 31. Johnson Matthey blamed “challenging” global conditions, including cuts to production by car makers that use its catalytic converters.

It also warned of a “slowdown in the energy transition” which had hit demand for green hydrogen technologies.

In the long-term, the company is betting that demand will continue for catalytic converters, primarily from larger vehicles that are difficult to decarbonise, even as governments encourage consumers to switch to electric cars.

On Thursday, it said that the internal combustion engine’s lifespan also looked longer than previously thought, due to slower-than-expected demand for electric vehicles and government policies that will continue to allow some hybrids to be sold.

The company added: “Over the past three years, we have seen a global slowdown in battery electric vehicle penetration and the regulatory environment has also supported internal combustion engine longevity.”

Along with cars, the company said it also saw opportunities in the rapidly growing data centre market, as demand surges for back-up generators which also use catalytic converters, as well as direct air capture of carbon dioxide.

Its platinum-based metals business, which refines key materials used in converters, is meanwhile hoping to tap into growing demand for metals recycling and future demand for hydrogen.

The division also refines metals for the pharmaceutical, defence and agricultural industries.

Today, RMI released Version 2.0 of its Green Upgrade Calculator – a free, advanced tool that enables home contractors, residential energy program implementers, and policy advisors to more accurately estimate the cost, energy, and environmental benefits of clean residential technologies. This includes any combination of upgrades such as rooftop solar, battery storage, air- and ground-source heat pumps, weatherization, heat pump water heaters, induction cooktops, and electric vehicles.

Since Version 1.0’s release one year ago, more than 10,000 individuals have used the Green Upgrade Calculator, and multiple home upgrade programs and HVAC software sales companies are integrating the calculator’s API to deliver custom results within their own platforms.

Improvements in Version 2.0

Version 2.0 builds upon these successes with three key improvements that make the tool even more useful:

Geothermal heat pumps are now an upgrade option

Results include a new energy use impact section

Results are more accurate with further refinement options

New upgrade option: Geothermal heat pumps

Geothermal (i.e., ground-source) (GSHPs) are around 400% to 500% more efficient than gas heating and roughly 50% to 100% more efficient than air-source heat pumps (ASHPs). As a result, they can significantly reduce both energy bills and carbon pollution.

A common question GSHP contractors or incentive programs receive from homeowners is: Will these bill savings pay back, and are ground-source heat pumps more cost-effective than air-source heat pumps?

With GSHPs now included in the calculator, contractors and program administrators can answer that question more confidently. For example, RMI used the calculator to model a home in Ithaca, New York, and found that GSHPs were the least-cost HVAC upgrade, around $10,000 less than a central AC and gas furnace — owing in good part to the large New York State GSHP incentives. These results will vary significantly across New York and the United States — in nearby Maryland, the same home would see the lowest costs by upgrading to an ASHP — so we recommend using the calculator to assess the best option for each specific home.

New result section: Energy impacts and usage estimates

In addition to cost and carbon pollution, Version 2.0 now includes an estimate of a home’s annual energy consumption by end use. This can be especially helpful for companies pairing rooftop solar with electrification upgrades, or for programs reporting energy savings in evaluation metrics.

For example, if the home above was curious about pairing rooftop solar with a GSHP, a contractor could use the calculator to estimate the annual electricity usage for the home after installing a GSHP (around 11,700 kWh per year). With that insight, they could recommend the most cost-effective rooftop solar system (around 8.5 kW) sized to offset most of the home’s annual electricity usage.

Even more accurate results with further refinement ability

Estimating the cost or carbon impact of a home upgrade often comes with the answer: “It depends.” And it truly does — on a wide range of factors. That’s why Version 2.0 of the Green Upgrade Calculator builds on Version 1.0’s 100+ optional inputs with even more ways to tailor results to specific homes and systems.

New features allow users to refine hybrid heat pump configurations to minimize costs and specify HVAC refrigerants and leakage rates to see carbon pollution impact.

For example, if the home above was interested in a hybrid heat pump, a contractor could now compare the operating costs of using a new air handler (around $1,450) versus leaving the furnace in place (around $1,600) with a 20 degrees F switchover temperature. They could also now quantify the environmental benefits of switching from R410a to R32 refrigerant in the heat pump (around 0.3 fewer tons of CO2e per year — equivalent to avoiding the consumption of over half a barrel of oil).

Lastly, with leveraging the newest data updated across all inputs in Version 2.0, users can trust the tool’s results to reflect today’s market and assess how effectively the selected upgrades can address rising energy costs.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/house-render-no-text-resized.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 11:57:33.997106

The transaction marks the largest-ever biochar carbon removal purchase agreement globally, and one of the largest durable carbon dioxide removal (CDR) agreements of any type to date, according to Exomad Green.

The agreement also integrates digital Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (dMRV) from CDR data solutions provider Carbonfuture to track and verify the carbon removed under the deal. The transaction follows an earlier 32,000 tonne carbon removal agreement between Microsoft, Exomad Green and Carbonfuture announced in 2023.

According to Exomad Green, the large-scale deal signals the industrial-scale readiness of biochar as a carbon removal solution, and will support the company’s goal of sequestering one million tonnes of CO2 annually by 2027.

Diego Justiniano, CEO of Exomad Green, said:

“Today’s historic deal is testament to the relationship we have formed between Microsoft and Exomad Green, powered by Carbonfuture’s dMRV. Microsoft has shown true climate leadership and commitment by seizing the immediate potential of biochar as a carbon removal solution that is measurable and scalable, while demonstrating significant co-benefits across communities and in improving soil quality.”

Biochar, or biological charcoal, is produced by heating biomass, such as forest residue, wood or crop waste, in the absence of oxygen, creating a stable form of carbon, which when buried in soil enables centuries-long carbon sequestration, in addition to leading to improved soil fertility. Biochar is emerging as an increasingly popular solution for carbon removal, providing a series of benefits and favorable attributes, including the ability to lock carbon for hundreds of years, scalability, with an abundance of biomass available, and low cost relative to other CDR technologies, as well as its agricultural benefits.

Exomad Green currently operates two biochar facilities in Bolivia, which were recently expanded to double capacity, and the company is constructing a third facility, with an additional two sites now in the planning stages. The company’s approach transforms waste biomass from sustainably sourced forestry residues into biochar, which is then delivered to local communities to use in agricultural soil improvement programs.

Carbonfuture’s dMRV system, Carbonfuture MRV+, will be used to ensure that every tonne of carbon removed under the new agreement is tracked across the lifecycle from carbon capture to credit issuance, for verification under the Biochar Methodology set by carbon-crediting platform Puro.earth. Additionally, the companies said that the agreement also includes key features to trace the origin of all biomass to uphold sourcing and traceability sustainability requirements, and product quality assurance, including regular quality testing ensures that the biochar consistently meets international standards for carbon sequestration and soil enhancement.

Hannes Junginger-Gestrich, CEO of Carbonfuture, said:

“This agreement sets a new precedent for how quality is built into carbon removal from day one. By embedding dMRV into the contract, this deal delivers the transparency and traceability the market needs as it scales toward megatonnes of impact.”

The new agreement further solidifies Microsoft’s already substantial lead as the largest corporate buyer of carbon removal credits globally, with carbon dioxide removals (CDRs) platform CDR.fyi estimating Microsoft’s purchases to date at more than 21.6 million tons, well ahead of the Frontier buyers group in second place at 1.25 million tons. The transaction also places Exomad Green in the top 5 CDR suppliers, according to CDR.fyi.

Brian Marrs, Senior Director of Energy & Carbon Removal at Microsoft, said:

“Microsoft is pleased to build on our relationship with Exomad Green and Carbonfuture to deliver high-quality, high-impact, and high-integrity durable CDR through biochar. We value Exomad Green’s commitment to high standards for biomass sustainability and traceability through its establishment of a new Forest Monitoring Center and recognize biochar’s significant co-benefits for community and soil quality in addition to its carbon removal potential.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Microsoft3-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 11:57:42.482982

Bionaphtha thus presents itself as a renewable alternative to fossil-based naphtha,” Rahman said.
Other innovations like mild hydrocracking configurations that allow for targeted production of bionaphtha fractions can also enhance the overall efficiency of bionaphtha production, he said.
More importantly, however, advancements that allow for better hydrogen recovery are particularly crucial in enhancing both the scalability and efficiency of bionaphtha production.
“This also enhances the efficiency of downstream SAF/bionaphtha production and thereby improves production economics, both of which enhance the supply and cost appeal to facilitate further scaling of bionaphtha production.”","SINGAPORE (ICIS)– ChemOne Group is planning to incorporate bionaphtha as a feedstock for its upcoming $5.3 billion Pengerang Energy Complex (PEC) in Johor, Malaysia, a senior company executive said.

The PEC is expected to process 150,000 barrels/day of condensate plus a side feed of naphtha, that will in turn produce 2.5 million tonnes/year of aromatics, 3.8 million tonnes/year of energy products output, and hydrogen output of 26,000 tonnes/year, according to Mobin Rahman, ChemOne Group’s Vice President for Technology.

Construction of the PEC project is expected to start by mid-2025 after its operator secured an agreement for $3.5 billion of financing, with the start-up of the complex expected in Q4 2028.

The hydrogen produced will be used to support the production of hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO), which in turn can be processed into sustainable bionaphtha, according to Rahman.

“The incorporation of bionaphtha as a feedstock in PEC will then advance ChemOne’s work in creating a sustainable, circular petrochemical chain,” he said.

Bionaphtha, a byproduct of HVO and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, is increasingly used in Asia’s petrochemical industry for sustainable plastics, packaging, and fuel blending.

“The petrochemical industry globally is heavily reliant on fossil-based naphtha as a feedstock in steam crackers to produce olefins. Bionaphtha thus presents itself as a renewable alternative to fossil-based naphtha,” Rahman said.

“This signals the potential for greater integration of bionaphtha into the petrochemical industry as its technology matures and supply increases,” Rahman noted.

However, its relatively higher cost as compared to conventional fossil-based naphtha makes its adoption limited.

Moreover, converting bionaphtha to paraxylene (PX) through catalytic reforming is challenging primarily due to the feedstock’s composition and the inherent limitations of the process.

Bionaphtha, derived from bio-crude oils, often contains a high proportion of normal paraffins and other non-aromatic components, which are difficult for catalytic reforming to convert into aromatics.

BIONAPHTHA USE IN ASIA INCREASING

Major petrochemical companies in Asia are incorporating bionaphtha in their steam crackers as a drop-in feedstock in place of fossil-based naphtha, or in a mix with fossil-based material to produce partially renewable chemicals.

“As a region that consumes the most plastics globally, the demand for plastics remains constantly high,” Rahman said.

“When coupled with the increasing eco-conscious preferences among consumers, we see a resulting heightened demand for bioplastics. This has, as such, been a significant driver in the region’s demand for bionaphtha as a feedstock for its production.”

In line with the global green transition, multiple countries in Asia have also enacted fuel blending mandates.

Singapore, for example, has set a 1% SAF blending mandate from 2026 onwards.

Given the current mandate by countries to ensure that SAF is blended with jet fuel, the production of SAF, and consequently the use and production of bionaphtha, is set to rise, Rahman said.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could contribute to a 65% reduction in emissions, much needed by the aviation industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

Just like fossil-based naphtha, bionaphtha can also be used as a gasoline blending component – offering a more sustainable fuel blend to help countries and companies achieve their decarbonization goals, according to Rahman.

While carbon capture & storage (CCS) and green hydrogen also offer valuable decarbonization strategies, bionaphtha provides a relatively easier and expected to be more readily available pathway.

“Looking ahead, the global momentum towards sustainability will likely continue to see an increasing demand for bionaphtha in petrochemical production processes.”

BIOPLASTICS USE GROWING

One of the most promising downstream applications for bionaphtha lies in bioplastics, Rahman noted, including polyethylene furanoate (PEF), bio-polyethylene (bio-PE) and bio-propylene (bio-PP).

PEF is a fully bio-based alternative to PET, while bio-PE and bio-PP are drop-in biopolymers with varying levels of bio-content, with bio-PP currently achieving up to 40% through the bio-mass balance process.

In South Korea and Japan, leading beauty brands are already incorporating bio-naphtha into packaging and product development, setting a precedent for other industries to follow, Rahman noted.

Companies like Japanese producer Nippon Shokubai and Indonesia’s Chandra Asri are exploring the use of bionaphtha in super absorbent polymer production (SAP), utilizing mass balance processes and independent certification bodies to ensure transparency and sustainability.

South Korea’s LG Chem has also been manufacturing eco-friendly plastic products using bio-naphtha since 2020.

LG Chem since 2021 has been shipping its bio-balanced SAP products – also certified with ISCC Plus – to overseas markets.

ISCC PLUS is an international certification system that verifies the sustainability of bio-based and bio-circular raw materials throughout the supply chain.

Separately, Mitsubishi Chemical has partnered with Japanese beverage company Suntory and apparel manufacturer Goldwin to use sustainable plastics for their end-products.

The conglomerate also locked in partnerships with providers of the key bioplastics ingredient bionaphtha. It announced a strategic partnership with Finnish company Neste for the bioplastics supply chain.

SUSTAINABILITY MANDATES TO PLAY KEY ROLE

Regulatory frameworks and sustainability mandates play a significant role in accelerating the adoption of bionaphtha, Rahman said.

“Policies surrounding the reduction of plastic waste – like Japan’s Plastic Resource Circulation Act for example – can incentivise manufacturers to adopt more sustainable production materials, while also encouraging retailers and consumers to opt for biobased plastics as an alternative to single-use plastics.”

“In addition to that six other Asian governments – Philippines, China, South Korea, India, Bangladesh, and Malaysia – are regulating plastic waste, thereby building a potential market for biobased alternatives.”

Other regulatory frameworks surrounding the general reduction of carbon emissions also help drive the adoption of bionaphtha in the petrochemical sector, as companies seek to harness potential financial incentives and avoid regulatory penalties, Rahman noted.

“Take for example carbon taxes implemented in countries like Singapore, with carbon tax rates that will increase at least thrice within the decade to reach $80 per tonne of GHG [greenhouse gas] by 2030,” he noted.

“Companies looking to comply with such regulatory requirements, or to be eligible for carbon credits and offsets, may turn towards bionaphtha to help reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions along the supply chain.”

South Korea’s emission trading scheme also specifically rewards companies that integrate renewable feedstocks into their petrochemical production, providing a financial incentive for the adoption of bionaphtha in the industry, Rahman added.

BIONAPHTHA MARKET SET FOR RAPID GROWTH

The market size for bionaphtha continues to expand at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% and is projected to reach more than 3 million tonnes by 2032, according to Rahman.

The expansion is due to increased environmental awareness, policies that encourage the use of sustainable energy, and improvements in production technology, he said.

“Currently, about 15% of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production results in bio-naphtha as a byproduct. If demand continues to rise, this ratio can be increased to 40%, but the industry must also grapple with the limited availability of bio-based raw materials such as waste cooking oil.”

“To ensure long-term viability, diversification of feedstock sources and the development of alternative production methods are imperative.”

COST COMPETITIVENESS REMAINS AN ISSUE

The key challenge for bionaphtha revolves around cost competitiveness, and this is especially pertinent for Asian petrochemical producers who operate on thinner margins compared to their Middle East and US counterparts who benefit from cheaper feedstocks, according to Rahman.

“Investing in low-carbon technologies is difficult for Asian producers if it further erodes their profit margins,” he said.

“Besides, in terms of feedstock, while bio-based alternatives such as bionaphtha are available, many petrochemical complexes still rely on fossil-based naphtha.”

“This is due to the comparatively higher prices of its alternatives, limited supplies depending on international supply chains, as well as potentially incompatible infrastructure where retrofitting is too costly.”

Steam cracking operates at temperatures above 800°C and consumes large amounts of energy.

This is mostly powered by fossil fuels, as its alternative – the electrification of steam crackers, requires high-capacity renewable energy that is not cost-competitive in Asia at the moment.

“Even if high-capacity renewable energy becomes more accessible, the electrification of steam crackers requires a complete redesign or a retrofit that would incur very high costs. As such, decarbonizing these steam crackers poses significant technical and economic hurdles for businesses,” Rahman said.

TECHNOLOGY TO THE RESCUE

Technological advancements – like the introduction of new hydrotreating catalysts, help to improve conversion efficiency and reduce coke formation, according to Rahman.

Other innovations like mild hydrocracking configurations that allow for targeted production of bionaphtha fractions can also enhance the overall efficiency of bionaphtha production, he said.

More importantly, however, advancements that allow for better hydrogen recovery are particularly crucial in enhancing both the scalability and efficiency of bionaphtha production.

“Especially in complexes like ChemOne Group’s PEC, where hydrogen is produced as a by-product and used in the downstream production of hydrogenated vegetable oils, embedding strong hydrogen recovery systems can help improve yield efficiency and reduce costs. This in turn better primes its production for scalability,” he said.

“In addition, at ChemOne Group’s Pengerang Energy Complex, engineering-driven improvements in its LD-PAREX technology have yielded an almost 10% increase in conversion percentage from its Condensate Feedstocks to its higher value aromatics products,” Rahman said.

“This also enhances the efficiency of downstream SAF/bionaphtha production and thereby improves production economics, both of which enhance the supply and cost appeal to facilitate further scaling of bionaphtha production.”",https://www.icis.com/explore/wp-content/themes/icis-2020/assets/images/social-share-image.png,N,,2025-05-22 11:57:56.773194

Two major players advancing SAF adoption from an energy standpoint are Neste, the global leader in renewable diesel and SAF production, and FedEx, the world’s largest express cargo airline.

The companies have entered a landmark agreement to supply 8,800 tonnes of blended SAF to FedEx at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), marking the largest SAF purchase by a US cargo airline at the airport to date.

Energy collaboration for SAF uptake

The agreement centres around Neste’s blended SAF, which will include at least 30% neat Neste ‘MY SAF’.

As a “drop-in” fuel, neat SAF can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used seamlessly within existing aircraft engines and fuelling infrastructure.

This fuel is expected to comprise about 20% of FedEx’s total jet fuel consumption at LAX for FY25.

“As the world’s preeminent express transportation company, our initial US deployment of this fuel advances our sustainability goals and bolsters the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF,” says Richard Smith, Chief Operating Officer, International, and Chief Executive Officer, Airline, FedEx.

“While we know further growth of the SAF market is needed, alongside other innovations, we are proud to celebrate this milestone with our world-class air network.”

Neste's ‘MY SAF’ can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil-based jet fuels.

It is made entirely from renewable waste and residue materials such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste, making it a viable long-term energy alternative.

FedEx’s broader energy strategy

FedEx has long invested in SAF as part of a comprehensive energy efficiency strategy.

Beyond Neste, it has collaborated with Boeing’s ecoDemonstrator programme, which achieved the first commercial aircraft flight powered by 100% SAF in both engines in 2018.

Additional efforts to reduce aviation fuel consumption include fleet modernisation, operational efficiency improvements and advanced flight planning.

“Procuring SAF is an important component of our aviation emissions-reduction strategy in the coming years,” comments Karen Blanks Ellis Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President of Environmental Affairs, FedEx.

“Our aviation network represents the largest amount of FedEx fuel use globally... we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.”

These strategies helped FedEx reach a 30% reduction in aviation emissions intensity by FY24, from a 2005 baseline.

U.S. industrials conglomerate Honeywell International said it agreed to buy Johnson Matthey's catalysts unit for 1.8 billion pounds ($2.42 billion), lifting shares in the British platinum refiner.

The sale of the unit, which designs and produces catalysts for the chemicals and energy industries, is expected to deliver net sale proceeds of about 1.6 billion pounds to Johnson Matthey, the U.K. company said.

Honeywell said it expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings in the first year.

The combination of Johnson Matthey's Catalyst Technologies business with Honeywell's Energy and Sustainability Solutions unit will boost the group's growth and create cost synergies, the U.S. group said.

The two businesses complement each other, Honeywell said, adding that it will for the first time be able to offer solutions for the production of lower emission fuels such as sustainable methanol, sustainable aviation fuel, blue hydrogen and blue ammonia.

Following the transaction, Johnson Matthey will focus on its Clean Air business and the processing of platinum group metals, the London-listed group added.

Shares in the U.K. chemicals company rose 33% in early morning trade Thursday on the back of the announcement. The stock is up 36% year to date, trading at 18.27 pounds.

The disposal comes after Johnson Matthey came under pressure from its biggest shareholder, the U.S.-based conglomerate Standard Industries, which said that Johnson Matthey's board destroyed shareholder value.

In an open letter sent in January, Standard Industries highlighted what it called the ""continued lack of urgency and incapacity of the current Board to do what is necessary to turn Johnson Matthey around and help it to realize its potential.""

The deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions of U.K. assets by U.S. companies, including DoorDash's purchase of U.K. food delivery company Deliveroo.

Meanwhile, Johnson Matthey posted revenue of 11.67 billion pounds for the year ended March 31, down 9% on year.

Its operating profit grew to 538 million pounds from 249 million pounds, while pretax profit rose to 486 million pounds from 164 million pounds.

Analysts had expected revenue of 12.08 billion pounds, pretax profit of 733.3 million pounds, and operating profit of 793.4 million pounds, according to company-compiled consensus estimates.

The board proposed a final dividend of 55 pence a share.

Airbus said it will continue to strengthen cooperation with Chinese suppliers to promote the use of SAF to contribute to the sustainable growth of the aviation industry.

""SAF, as the biggest contributor, helps with the decarbonization of the aviation industry. Compared to fossil jet fuel, it can reduce 80 percent of carbon emissions on average in the entire SAF life cycle,"" said Claire Kauffmann, head of SAF and carbon dioxide removal global ecosystem at Airbus.

Kauffmann said that China has great advantages in the production of SAF, given its rich resources of feedstock and rapid development of renewable energy. China's strong manufacturing capability, unified government policies and a stable business environment provide continuous impetus for the long-term development of the sector.

This year marks the 40th anniversary of Airbus' operations in the country. The aircraft manufacturer said it has always been committed to long-term and trustful partnerships with the Chinese aviation industry.

Besides SAF, Airbus has continued to expand its industrial footprint by investing in various activities. It is expanding the A320 aircraft's final assembly capacity in Tianjin with a second line, and the new facility is expected to be put into operation by early 2026.

As a global company with roots in Europe, Airbus said it advocates for fair and open trade, and win-win cooperation. China has been insisting on high-standard opening-up and improving its business environment, an effort that Airbus highly respects.

For the development of SAF, China has abundant types of raw material resources, including waste cooking oil, agricultural and forestry waste, and urban organic waste, providing a solid foundation for building a globally leading green aviation industry system. It is predicted that by 2030, the annual available raw materials for producing SAF in China will support a potential production capacity of up to 12 million metric tons.

China, the European Union and the United States have all introduced policies to encourage the use of SAF.

In the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25), the Civil Aviation Administration of China proposed that the cumulative consumption volume of SAF in China should reach 50,000 tons over the period, and the annual consumption volume of SAF in 2025 should exceed 20,000 tons.",,N,,2025-05-22 04:57:45.340190

This creates a truly global market for SAF, which is essential for meeting the commercial aviation industry’s net zero targets,” Dr Camrass said.
ENDS NOTES TO EDITOR Given that SAF production is not occurring at any material scale in Australia, emissions reductions from SAF use are not currently reflected in Australia’s GHG inventory.","22 May 2025: Virgin Australia and Boeing have today released a report by Pollination on the challenges and opportunities of an International Book and Claim system for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) accounting.

The report, completed by independent advisory firm, Pollination and unveiled at an industry event in partnership with the University of NSW’s Decarbonisation Innovation Hub, examines the challenges inherent in the current policy frameworks and the critical points of consideration to unlock alternative SAF accounting frameworks, such as Book and Claim.

The Book and Claim system separates the environmental benefits of SAF from the physical fuel. This allows airlines to purchase and claim the environmental benefits of SAF without physically transporting and storing the fuel, reducing the logistics costs and avoiding the additional unnecessary carbon emissions.

Book and Claim represents a significant opportunity for Australia, which has natural advantages for SAF production, including abundant feedstock resources. With this system, Australia could become an exporter of environmental benefits to regions where SAF production is limited or unavailable, creating economic opportunities by aggregating demand from both domestic and international markets, while supporting global aviation decarbonisation.

Australia’s current greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting system allows airlines to recognise emissions reductions from direct combustion of SAF, but lacks mechanisms to account for SAF that Australian airlines purchase that is used outside the country.

Comments from Virgin Australia General Manager Sustainability Fiona Walmsley:

“In partnership with Boeing and the NSW Powerfuels including Hydrogen Network, we’re thrilled to bring together industry and academic leaders to present and explore the latest research supporting aviation’s transition to net zero emissions by 2050,” Ms Walmsley said.

“SAF is the most critical decarbonisation lever for the aviation sector to reach net zero emissions, but production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel must accelerate significantly for the global aviation sector to achieve this goal.”

“This report outlines how a Book and Claim system would allow Australian airlines to contribute to aviation decarbonisation even before domestic SAF production commences. By enabling airlines to purchase SAF benefits regardless of location, we can accelerate industry-wide adoption and ultimately drive down costs.”

""Enabling a Book and Claim system helps to avoid logistics costs and unfavourable environmental outcomes that occur from having to move fuel from where it is produced to where a customer is based.”

Comments from Boeing Sustainability Lead Australia, New Zealand and South Pacific, Dr Kimberly Camrass:

“Book and Claim is critical to scaling SAF uptake globally. It eliminates geographical barriers, allowing airlines to access the environmental benefits of SAF even when they operate in regions where production is not possible or not yet established. This creates a truly global market for SAF, which is essential for meeting the commercial aviation industry’s net zero targets,” Dr Camrass said.

“Ensuring collective action by governments and industry is underpinned by world-leading research, such as that occurring through the NSW Powerfuels including Hydrogen Network, is vital.”

The report was commissioned by Virgin Australia with the support of Boeing. It is available here on the Virgin Australia website.

Good vibrations

This NBA season, blind and low-vision basketball fans have been able to follow the action from their arena seats using a handheld device that describes the game through vibrations. Seattle-based start-up OneCourt was founded in 2021 and its haptic device debuted with the Portland Trail Blazers in January. The technology uses wi-fi and 5G to transmit data from arena sensors and cameras; coupled with a live broadcast, fans who can’t see the game can follow the action as the device signals, for example, where a three-point shot was taken.

The early-stage start-up has raised $475,000 (€420,000) from angel investors, including Microsoft’s ceo, Satya Nadella, and five NBA teams have signed up for the service. OneCourt has also engineered versions for baseball and football, which could be used during the Fifa Club World Cup that kicks off on 14 June. Co-founder Jerred Mace and his team currently make the OneCourt device in-house but he hopes to produce it at scale for an underserved market of sports fans who will be able to use it at home too. “We want to have a product that doesn’t just live in the stadium,” he says.

Out for a spin

Private helicopter transfers tend to be functional affairs, with cramped cabins and the lingering scent of jet fuel. Helsinki Citycopter, a Finnish firm founded in 2020, does things differently: the five helicopters in its fleet, which includes two Airbus ACH130s and an H125, have spacious interiors with leather seats, noise-cancelling headsets and efficient climate control. Powered by sustainable aviation fuel and modern low-emission engines, the aircraft also leave a smaller environmental footprint than many of their competitors. “There’s a unique advantage to helicopter travel,” says co-founder Joonas Nurmi, who spent 15 years with Finnair. “You get perspectives that you don’t see from a plane or car and you can land almost anywhere.”

Now the market leader in northern Europe, the company has steadily expanded, adding a Cessna Citation CJ4 private jet to its portfolio and launching a flight academy for helicopter and fixed-wing pilots. In addition to transfers, the firm enables travel to remote destinations, including Lapland, the Finnish archipelago and the Lofoten Islands. “Our product is nature,” says Nurmi. “And we fly where no one else does.”

Growth opportunity

When Donald Trump launched his first tariff broadsides at Canada’s economy in February, Canadian shopping habits shifted abruptly – away from American-made goods and towards more homegrown brands. That presents an opportunity for independent Canadian food companies. Among them is Lufa Farms, the innovative urban agriculture firm and marketplace for Québec-grown produce, which was co-founded in Montréal in 2009 by Lebanese engineer and entrepreneur Mohamed Hage and is currently expanding its reach across the country.

Inspired by the rooftop fruit-and-vegetable gardens that are a fixture of urban life in Hage’s home country, Lufa Farms operates as a network of rooftop hydroponic greenhouses on the flat roofs of industrial buildings, warehouses and big-box retail complexes in Montréal and across the broader region. The vegetables cultivated inside, which are watered by a system of rainwater- and ice-melt collection from the greenhouse roofs, are then picked and assorted into weekly grocery baskets.",https://monocle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/da9964de-08ef-434b-88f4-3e614f326fb9_thumb.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 20:57:06.473080

With global demand for eco-friendly jet fuel soaring, Ghana is positioning itself to become a regional hub for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, unlocking new investment, jobs, and a greener aviation future.

Accra, Ghana. Ghana is positioning itself to tap into the multi-million-dollar Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Market as part of a collective global effort for aviation to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Stakeholders at the just-ended International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) workshop on the Assistance, Capacity Building and Training Programme for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (ACT-SAF), held in Accra, Ghana and hosted by the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), committed to harnessing the potential in the development and deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) in Ghana.

Ghana and other African countries are yet to tap into this multi-billion-dollar industry despite the availability of raw materials for SAF production, such as cooking oil, plant oils, wood chips, treated straw, algae, municipal waste, waste gases, and agricultural residue.

For nearly two decades, Ghana has experimented with the production of plant-based sustainable fuels mainly from the Jatropha plant. The technology developed so far, has been only able to produce biodiesel for use by small-scale agro-processing machines.

The setting up of waste treatment plants in Accra and Kumasi by the Jospong Group of Companies holds a lot of promise for Ghana to venture into the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The raw materials—organic and inorganic waste—abound in a country struggling to contain and properly dispose or reuse the millions of tons of municipal waste across the country.

In Ghana, about 12,710 tons of solid waste is generated daily. The capital city, Accra, generates as much as 15,000 tons of solid waste per day. Research on the waste composition of Ghana’s solid waste in 2020 shows that it is predominantly organic (60%), plastic (14 %), paper (5%), metals (3%), and glass (3%).

Dignitaries in attendance underscored the national importance of the programme for the environment and the financial benefits of going into SAF production using locally available raw materials.

The dignitaries included: Hon. Joseph Nikpe Bukari, Minister for Transport; Hon. John Abdulai Jinapor, Minister for Energy; Hon. Dr. Ibrahim Murtala Muhammed, Minister for Environment, Science and Technology; Hon. Eric Opoku, Minister for Food and Agriculture; and Hon. Dr. Cassiel Ato Forson, Minister for Finance.

They noted that the workshop aligns seamlessly with Ghana’s roadmap to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070, demonstrating a strong link between national and global aviation sustainability goals.

A key focus of the discussions revolved around the ICAO’s extensive work on SAF, which began with the first international conference on aviation and alternative fuels in Rio de Janeiro in 2009. Initial efforts concentrated on demonstrating the safety of SAF as a viable alternative to conventional jet fuel. Subsequent conferences in 2017 and a pivotal ICAO Assembly resolution in 2020 further solidified the global commitment to long-term carbon emissions reduction in aviation.

The ACT-SAF program, a crucial facilitator of this roadmap, supports countries in adopting sustainable aviation practices. The workshop delved into ICAO’s four key “building blocks” for achieving this goal: policy and planning, regulatory framework, implementation support, and finance.

Ghana’s existing national decarbonization goals were cited as a fundamental element of the policy and planning block, with action plans already in place.

Market Trends and Implications for Airlines CORSIA credits are part of the larger voluntary carbon market.
As the report shows, the window to build a balanced, credible carbon market is narrowing.","The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), plays a major role in helping airlines offset their emissions and meet climate goals.

International air travel is bouncing back after the pandemic. This drives a surge in demand for carbon credits under CORSIA. A new report by Allied Offsets forecasts strong growth in both demand and prices of eligible carbon credits from 2025 through 2035.

This article explores the latest trends, price scenarios, and what this means for airlines, project developers, and the broader voluntary carbon market.

Rising Demand: Airlines Set to Purchase More Credits

Industry estimates say that demand for CORSIA-eligible carbon credits will hit 101 to 148 million tonnes (MtCO₂e) during Phase I (2024–2026). Demand will rise quickly in Phase II (2027–2035).

Cumulative needs are expected to be between 502 and 1,299 MtCO₂e. This will depend on how much international air traffic grows and how CORSIA expands its coverage.

This big increase comes from the rebound in international air travel and the start of Phase II in 2027. During this phase, most ICAO member countries must take part.

By 2035, demand might exceed 1 billion tonnes in high-growth scenarios. That’s about the same as the yearly emissions of a major industrialized country.

To summarize projected cumulative demand:

Phase I (2024–2026): 101–148 MtCO₂e

Phase II (2027–2035): 502–1,299 MtCO₂e

This growth presents both challenges and opportunities. Airlines need enough credits to comply with regulations. At the same time, project developers and suppliers face pressure to increase the verified supply of eligible credits.

Price Outlook: A Wide Range with Upward Pressure

The report outlines three price scenarios for carbon credits based on different market dynamics:

Low Scenario: Prices start at $14/tonne in a tight supply scenario and grow slowly to $25/tonne in under supply scenario.

Medium Scenario: Prices rise from $15/tonne to $29/tonne.

High Scenario: Prices climb sharply from $16/tonne to $34/tonne.

Even in the conservative case, prices show modest growth. But in the high-demand scenario, prices could grow over the next decade.

On the other hand, MSCI outlines a range of price scenarios for CORSIA-eligible carbon credits as follows:

Phase I (2024–2026): $18–$51 per tonne

Phase II (2027–2035): $27–$91 per tonne (by 2033–2035)

This price rise shows that airlines face more pressure to secure high-quality credits. This is especially true as more projects focus on long-term removal instead of just temporary avoidance.

High prices might lead some airlines to invest in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or insets. These options help reduce emissions in their operations.

Supply Gaps and Quality Filters

CORSIA doesn’t allow just any carbon credit. ICAO has strict rules for what qualifies — including restrictions on project start dates, crediting periods, and approved methodologies. Only credits from approved programs (like Verra, Gold Standard, and ART TREES) that meet these standards are eligible.

The report estimates that:

Only about 543 MtCO₂e of eligible credits will be issued by 2027.

Supply is projected to lag behind demand. Reports suggest possible deficits of 12–43 MtCO₂e in Phase I. Phase II may face even larger shortfalls. This is likely if stricter quality filters are used. These filters include co-benefits, permanence, and additionality. The exact numbers for filtered supply aren’t given, but these criteria would greatly lower the usable pool.

Currently, most eligible supply comes from avoided deforestation (REDD+) and renewable energy projects. As demand increases and quality standards get stricter, the market will likely move toward lasting carbon removal solutions. This includes methods like reforestation, biochar, and direct air capture (DAC).

Regional Insights: Where Supply Comes From

The current credit supply under CORSIA is heavily concentrated in a few countries:

India, China, and Brazil together account for over 50% of the available supply.

Africa has fewer CORSIA-eligible credits now. However, it is expected to grow. This growth will focus on nature-based solutions, such as afforestation and cookstove projects.

This geographic concentration means that any changes in policy, political stability, or project approvals in key countries could disrupt supply. For example, if India were to change its rules on carbon credit exports — as some officials have suggested — global supply could shrink quickly.

Interest is growing in boosting credit generation in Southeast Asia and Latin America. Many areas there have good land for reforestation and carbon farming.

Market Trends and Implications for Airlines

CORSIA credits are part of the larger voluntary carbon market. This market has attracted a lot of interest from companies and governments. According to MSCI report, voluntary carbon markets could reach $250 billion annually by 2050.

But today’s CORSIA credits are selling for far less than the cost of removing CO₂ using high-tech methods like DAC, which can exceed $300 per tonne. This price gap has raised questions about credit quality and how buyers can demonstrate real climate impact.

Some key trends include:

Airlines such as Delta, United, and Lufthansa are now mixing credit purchases with investments in SAF. They also support offsets from reforestation or engineered removals.

Programs like SBTi (Science-Based Targets initiative) encourage firms to reduce emissions. They also promote high-quality removals instead of bulk offsetting.

For airlines, this means they may need to:

Budget more for compliance over time

Diversify carbon offset portfolios

Communicate clearly about the credibility of their offsets

The Bigger Picture: What Comes Next

The Allied Offsets report shows that corporate buyers, like airlines, play a key role in global carbon markets. Their large, long-term offtake agreements — such as Microsoft’s 18 MtCO₂e deal with Rubicon Carbon — are shaping demand signals for the next decade.

ICAO plans to tighten CORSIA rules in future reviews. This may mean more removals and limits on older avoidance projects. This could further reduce supply and raise prices.

Policymakers can boost support for in-sector measures. This includes increasing SAF production and encouraging new removal technologies.

Airlines face challenges now. They must deal with rising prices, new rules, and increased scrutiny on carbon offsetting. In the long run, using durable carbon removals could change aviation and the climate finance system.

CORSIA is entering a critical phase. Demand is set to rise sharply. Meanwhile, supply is tightening due to stricter quality controls. As the report shows, the window to build a balanced, credible carbon market is narrowing. The next few years will shape the cost and credibility of airline decarbonization for decades to come.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2510038883.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 19:56:48.583718

The global energy landscape is undergoing constant change as energy security and diversification shape the future of fuel.

Among the most promising avenues in this transition is the production of renewable fuels, which offer a viable alternative and supplement to traditional fossil fuels.

Hydrotreating is a ubiquitous technology present in every refinery in the world. It is commonplace for a refinery to have several different hydrotreating units, each designed and optimised to treat different fractions from the initial distillation of crude oil, including naphtha hydrotreaters, diesel hydrotreaters, and FCC pretreat units. The process conditions and catalyst systems are tailored to the specific requirements of the different feed streams while meeting the required specifications for each product stream.

At one level, adapting hydrotreating technology to process renewable feedstocks to produce hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFAs) represents one of the lowest-cost, easiest-to-implement options in the transition from fossil to renewable-based products.

However, the production of renewable fuels for both existing refiners and new producers is not without its challenges when it comes to the catalytic processes involved. The catalyst system must be designed to manage the specific characteristics of renewable feedstocks and produce high-quality fuels. This article explores the critical role of catalysts in renewable fuels production, the challenges associated with processing renewable feedstocks, and the innovative solutions that are driving the industry forwards.

Complexities of Renewable Feedstock Processing

Hydrotreating catalyst systems have evolved over the years such that most units today are loaded in layers of catalysts, each with different catalytic functions. The top layer comprises guard bed catalysts specifically designed to remove contaminants such as nickel and vanadium metals from fossil feed streams while minimising the build-up of pressure drop to ensure this function does not limit the operating cycle of the unit.

The next layers comprise catalyst developed for maximum hydrogenation efficiency to remove sulphur and, if needed, also saturate aromatics. The system may include catalysts to remove nitrogen if this is required (for example, for hydrocracking units). At the bottom of the hydrogenation unit is a catalyst layer designed to minimise sulphur recombination.

Renewable feedstocks, such as vegetable oils, animal fats, and waste oils, pose unique challenges compared to traditional fossil-based feedstocks. The complex reaction mechanisms involved in hydrotreating renewable materials differ significantly from those of conventional petroleum refining. If catalysts are not specifically designed to handle these complexities, the consequences can be severe: poor product yield, byproduct formation, accelerated catalyst deactivation, and pressure drop build-up.

Additionally, the hydrotreated product has to meet the required product specifications, namely ASTM D-975 for diesel and D-7566 for SAF, including the cold flow properties, which are critical for fuel performance in colder climates (diesel) or at altitude sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

To address these challenges, catalyst systems must be tailor-made for renewable feedstock processing. This involves developing catalysts that can effectively manage the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of renewable feeds, improve cold flow properties through isomerisation, and maintain stable operation under varying conditions.

To meet these complex requirements, Topsoe has developed specialised catalysts for these purposes, enabling the production of on-spec renewable diesel and SAF without operational issues.

Catalyst Innovations for Renewable Fuels

Central to this has been the introduction of a range of dedicated catalysts designed specifically for the hydroprocessing of renewable feedstocks. Recently launched to the market are third-generation Topsoe HDO catalysts selective for the hydrogenation route designated TK-3001, TK-3002, and TK-3003. These will provide producers with better HDO selectivity via the hydrogenation route, higher activity, and high metals, resulting in a significantly longer cycle length. The higher HDO selectivity throughout the cycle length of the catalyst will result in a significantly higher average product yield compared to the previous generation of HDO catalysts, which will increase the profitability of the plant.

The catalyst loading also includes an isomerising dewaxing catalyst to ensure that the renewable diesel and SAF meet the required cloud point and freeze point of the final product. The specialised guard beds catalysts are designed to pick up the contaminants in the feedstock, such as P, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Ni, and V. The most significant poison is typically phosphorus (P). To address this, Topsoe has developed a more efficient P guard, TK-3000 PhosTrap, which picks up four to six times as much P on a volume basis as its previous P guard in renewable service.

Reduced Complexity and Lower Costs

In addition to picking up contaminants, the guard bed catalysts are designed to use the hydrogenation route like the main bed catalyst to ensure that the oxygen in the triglyceride is converted to water instead of CO₂. The hydrogenation route improves the product yield and will not make CO₂ as opposed to the decarboxylation route, which produced significant amounts of CO₂.

The fact that Topsoe’s specialised HDO main bed catalysts and guard bed catalysts produced almost no CO₂ is the reason why its licensed process technology called HydroFlex does not include an amine unit in the high-pressure loop. The elimination of the amine unit from the process layout has many advantages, such as reduced Capex and Opex, lower carbon intensity (CI score), and decreased operating complexity.

The effectiveness of these HDO and dewaxing catalysts has been demonstrated in more than 25 industrial units, and many of Topsoe-licensed units have used loads of its HDO and dewaxing catalysts.

Choosing the Right Catalyst for Co-Processing

Introducing even minor amounts of biomaterial into a fossil diesel or kerosene hydrotreater requires a thorough understanding of the implications and strategies to mitigate potential risks. Co-processing renewable and fossil feedstocks introduces additional complexities. The hydrotreater must still convert all organic sulphur and nitrogen in the fossil portion of the feed to meet product specifications, while the HDO catalysts must convert all of the renewable feed.

To achieve these multiple objectives, the HDO-graded bed catalysts are typically loaded on top of a NiMo fossil catalyst. The trick is to load the right amount of each type of catalyst so that the cycle length of the HDO catalyst matches that of the fossil NiMo catalyst while maintaining a stable pressure drop across all the catalysts. The ratio of the different types of catalysts is, of course, governed by the percentage of co-processing.

It is also important to determine if a dewaxing catalyst is needed in the bottom of the reactor (below the fossil catalyst) to ensure that the mixture of fossil and renewable diesel still meets the required cloud point. Topsoe is experienced in designing the loading of a co-processing unit to meet all product and cycle length objective and has more than 20 hydroprocessing units currently in operation in co-processing mode.

Conclusion

The production of renewable fuels represents a significant step forwards in the diversification of the global energy landscape. However, success depends on the development and deployment of advanced catalysts that can handle the unique challenges of renewable feedstock processing. Topsoe’s third-generation HDO catalyst, selective towards the hydrogenation route, and its specialised graded bed HDO catalysts are effective in both co-processing and standalone units.

The catalyst and process technology not only ensure the production of high-quality renewable fuels but also enhance the profitability of the unit by increasing the product yield and extending the cycle length, thus improving the onstream performance. The enhanced capacity for picking up contaminants, including phosphorus, helps the refiner process lower-quality renewable feedstocks to further enhance the profitability of the operation.

As the industry continues to evolve, the role of catalysts in enabling the energy future cannot be overstated.",https://www.topsoe.com/hubfs/Catalysts%20for%20Renewable%20Fuels%20Production.png,N,,2025-05-21 17:56:46.739089

Now, a drive by the Brazilian government to incentivize the decarbonization of the transportation and aviation sectors has resulted in numerous companies turning to this palm as a potential feedstock to be refined into liquid biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) across the Latin American nation.

On paper, macaúba palm appears to be a miracle plant: It thrives on degraded, unproductive land, so won’t compete with food crops or cause new deforestation, and, in testing, it has yields eight to ten times higher than soy, depending on whom you ask. Soybeans already feed Brazil’s vast biofuels industry but, along with sugarcane, soy is tied to environmental harm, especially deforestation and CO2 emissions, and environmental justice issues.

According to proponents, macaúba promises to sidestep these issues; it’s already dubbed as “green gold” and “rainforest-friendly palm oil.” But there are significant environmental and financial risk too, say critics. Macaúba’s promotion closely parallels past hype from investors and entrepreneurs who backed a would-be biofuel called jatropha, so offers a cautionary tale.

In the 2000s, jatropha — also hailed as “green gold” — ticked many of the same boxes and its boom saw dozens of projects planting the energy crop across the tropics, only to then fail spectacularly, as it proved far more challenging to grow than claimed. The effort cost millions of dollars, and spawned widespread accusations of land grabbing, while resulting in land-use change and biodiversity loss in tropical countries.

Opinions are mixed as to whether macaúba will make the grade. For Almuth Ernsting, a researcher with the NGO Biofuelswatch, macaúba’s buildup sounds like a “smaller version” of the hype seen around jatropha.

Miracle fuel, or just like jatropha?

On paper, macaúba has all the hallmarks of a great biofuel feedstock, and more. Experts note that its oil and other plant parts can be utilized in a wide variety of products, ranging from foods to cosmetics. Some researchers say it could even be the basis for a strong bioeconomy, supporting smallholder farmers in the process and helping mitigate climate change. Such claims were also made for jatropha.

One thing is sure: Brazil is awash with degraded agricultural land, especially abandoned cow pasture and worn-out croplands. Four billion liters (1.05 billion gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel could be produced per year if just 10,000 square kilometers (3,861 square miles) of land were converted to macaúba palm plantations, says Ricardo Fujii, a conservation specialist at WWF Brasil. “That is equivalent to 0.1% of the Brazilian territory.”

For now, macaúba’s hype and investment remain centered in Brazil and neighboring Paraguay. At least three companies thus far are aiming to exploit its potential. This drive is being boosted by billions of dollars of private investment, plus green government incentives, including those born out of Brazil’s recently legislated Fuels for the Future bill. This growth will allow Brazil to “drive the world’s largest energy revolution,” according to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

Acelen Renewables, a subsidiary of Dubai-based Mubadala Capital, plans to plant 1,800 km2 (695 mi2) of macaúba in Brazil, and produce its first macaúba-based fuels in 2027 or 2028, transforming the palm into renewable diesel and SAF. Renewable diesel (RD), often made in converted oil refineries, has the advantage of being a “drop in” fuel, able to replace fossil diesel without any changes to an existing diesel engine or turbine.

Environmentalists have raised concerns about RD, saying that industry lifecycle carbon emission claims are often exaggerated and that, when RD use is scaled up, it will quickly outstrip existing feedstock availability, leading to an explosion in energy crop expansion, risking a new wave of tropical deforestation and other environmental harm.

Acelen has already started planting genetically modified cloned macaúba palm at a model farm in Brazil’s Bahia state, says company CEO Marcelo Cordaro. “It will be a gradual planting, year by year, until we reach 180,000 hectares [444,800 acre] of degraded pastures in the states of Minas Gerais and Bahia.” Minas Gerais state is at the intersection of three prominent Brazilian biomes, while Bahia state is in the Cerrado savanna, a biome much reduced by industrial agriculture, particularly soy production.

Another company, Brazilian-German Inocas aims to plant around 500 km2 (193 mi2) of macaúba by 2030, using degraded cattle pasture and saying it will collaborate with smallholder farmers and support “regenerative agriculture.”

Promise of expansion — but doubts and constraints

If early efforts reap fuel and profit, macaúba could spread to other tropical countries and continents. Acelen says further study is needed to identify suitable locations beyond Brazil, “but its cultivation in other countries can be considered in the medium and long term,” says Cordaro.

A paper published earlier this year assessed suitable climatic locations where macaúba can grow. It highlighted South Asia, and Indonesia, in particular, with high potential for the energy crop. Similar studies showcasing jatropha’s adaptability laid the foundations for its rapid expansion and eventual bust.

Simone Palma Favaro, a researcher at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa in Portuguese) believes that as a native fruit to Brazil, macaúba won’t follow a similar path as jatropha in the country.

But that doesn’t mean success will take hold elsewhere. In her view, the global study failed to account for factors key for macaúba’s growth, such as soil requirements. “Additionally, there is the presence of pollinators, without which there can be no fruit formation, and, in the case of macaúba, these are very specific insects that I believe do not exist on other continents.”

Like jatropha and also oil palm, macaúba palm requires extensive manual labor; plucking the oil-rich kernels must currently be done by hand. Researchers are working to solve this challenge through mechanization, but until then a large agricultural workforce will be required to make this crop work.

Another issue is that, just because a plant can grow on degraded land, it doesn’t mean it will thrive and provide high yields there; that’s one of the key lessons from the jatropha experience, says Ernsting. Acelen notes that new plantations will still need to use “traditional” mineral fertilizers, for example, to make the trees thrive year after year.

Concerns are that, despite its promise, macaúba could lead to the same negative land-use changes as jatropha and other biofuel crops, particularly in the already highly threatened Cerrado, much of which is not protected. To that point, back in 2016 researchers highlighted this possibility at the outset of the macaúba hype, finding that much of the suitable planting area overlaps with areas of “high conservation value.” Climate change could also place constraints on where macaúba grows in the near future.

Critics also worry that renewable diesel and SAF will fail to live up to their sustainable credentials once upscaled due to dubious carbon counting, the need to tap into higher carbon intensity feedstocks, and indirect deforestation, limiting their effectiveness as climate solutions.

Ernsting underlines that oil palm — a key driver of tropical deforestation — requires the smallest area of land per ton for vegetable oils. “It’s precisely the high yields and adaptability of African oil palm, coupled with the vast and unsustainable demand for vegetable oils, especially for biofuels, that are responsible for the large-scale land-conversion and land-grabbing for oil palm plantations,” she says. “The idea that another oil crop can help meet this unsustainable, constantly growing, demand with less harm is just absurd.”

However, others, including Fujii, believe that best practices, such as combining macaúba with pasturelands and intercropping, offer a potential route forward. “In theory, [it] is possible to have a sustainable biofuel produced from macaúba that delivers not only emissions reduction, but also improves food production and protects biodiversity,” says Fujii. He does agree that, though the risk of deforestation or degradation is minor, it still exists “particularly considering that Brazil has a bad track record on protecting its natural habitats.”

“Brazil has a lot of degraded areas, but it’s the same with any biofuel,” says Ana Carolina Oliveira Fiorini, post-doctoral researcher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro’s Energy Planning Program. She led a 2022 paper assessing decarbonization and deforestation potential for macaúba and other energy feedstocks in Brazil. “You have to make sure that it is actually grown on degraded lands and not competing with food crops or expanded into areas covered with natural vegetation to be sustainable,” she says.

Macaúba takes off?

It will take time for macaúba’s potential to become known — one way or the other. That’s because it will take up to six years for the seeds sown today to grow to maturity. Also, the tree has yet to be fully domesticated, meaning that hoped-for high yields cannot be guaranteed.

Researchers and companies are currently planning to pick seeds from the most promising wild trees and plant them, creating cultivars that can be easily reproduced. But genetic work — to breed high-yielding crops — is ongoing and remains a challenge.

Simone is positive that the palm’s potential will be achieved, whether that’s for biofuels or other industries. Her lab worked on jatropha during its boom and bust, and she says she believes macaúba differs from that failed venture. She notes that much of the scientific groundwork that jatropha lacked is now being done on Brazil’s native palm. In Fujii’s view “commercialization at an economic scale” might take up to 10 years to develop.

Sergey Paltsev, deputy director of the MIT Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy, co-authored a 2024 report on Latin America’s decarbonization pathways. It only briefly covered macaúba, concluded that the palm has potential, but it is too early to assess.

“As with any new technology, there is a risk that technology will not deliver as promised,” Paltsev says. “We need all sustainable options to accelerate decarbonization, and macaúba might be a substantial contributor to these efforts. We just need to explore more and understand better the actual performance.”

The scene is set for a potentially vast expansion of macaúba plantations across Brazil, and possibly other countries and continents. Only time will tell whether it proves viable or flops like jatropha. And this grand experiment comes with risk: The threat of land-use change, especially further deforestation, and the feeding of demand for biofuels that have yet to prove their emission-slashing promise.

Until its plants come to fruition, Acelen plans to make its biofuels from established crops like soy. “The prospect is that we will be producing 100% macaúba by the end of this decade,” says Cordaro.

Introduction

We have set out below an overview of the current regulatory frameworks governing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the key jurisdictions of the UK, EU and USA.

SAF has emerged as a critical component in the global drive to decarbonise the aviation sector, a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike conventional jet fuels, SAF offers substantial reductions in lifecycle carbon emissions by incorporating renewable feedstocks and innovative production technologies.

Recognising its potential to drive sustainable growth, policymakers across the UK, EU, and USA are actively shaping regulatory frameworks to accelerate its deployment and adoption.

Note that this is an evolving regulatory landscape that is subject to change – however, this overview sets out the current regulations and initiatives of each of the UK, EU and USA – and strongly indicates the direction of travel of each of these jurisdictions.

We conclude with a comparison of these jurisdictions and analyse their strengths and limitations in fostering market growth. We also examine potential pathways for future development, including harmonisation of international standards, technological advancements, and policy synergies.

By presenting such analysis and exploring projected trends, this overview offers insights into the role of regulation in shaping the trajectory of SAF as an essential enabler of sustainable aviation.

United Kingdom

The UK SAF landscape

Current Status and Future Developments

The UK’s SAF industry is progressing rapidly, driven by a number of policy measures that integrate SAF into the UK’s broader decarbonisation goals. With increasing regulatory and financial support, the UK aims to position itself as a global leader in SAF development, production, commercialisation and use.

A key component of this strategy is the SAF Mandate, alongside other legislative and market-based incentives designed to accelerate SAF adoption. Under these principles, SAF is defined based on achieving a minimum level of greenhouse gas emission reductions and specific sustainability criteria.

The key features include the introduction of compulsory, incrementally increasing SAF supply requirements, a buy-out mechanism to enforce compliance, and funding incentives to support industry growth.

The Jet Zero Taskforce (JZT) (building on the previous Government’s Jet Zero Council) was announced by the UK Government in November 2024 to advance sustainable aviation. Members include UK Government ministers, industry leaders and academics. Established to accelerate the transition to net zero aviation by 2050, the JZT aims to streamline aviation decarbonization priorities and support the development, production, commercialisation and use of SAF in the UK and globally.

Legislation

The UK is at the forefront of SAF development as the one of the first countries in the world to legislate for mandatory SAF requirements. The UK’s key policy to decarbonize aviation and secure demand for SAF is the SAF Mandate.

SAF Mandate

Key terms (2025 onwards):

The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) Order 2024 came into force on January 1, 2025. This introduced compulsory SAF requirements for suppliers of at least 15.9 terajoules (c.468,000 litres) per year of aviation fuel to the UK: from 2025, SAF is required to make up 2% of the total UK aviation fuel mix, increasing to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

SAF suppliers earn Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates for SAF supplied to the UK that meets certain GHG emission reductions and sustainability criteria (SAF must comprise fuel that achieves minimum GHG emission reductions of 40% relative to traditional fossil fuel-based jet fuel). Evidence of the SAF supplied to UK needs to be provided to the Department for Transport to assess and award corresponding certificates. The number of certificates issued will be proportionate to the level of GHG emission reductions achieved by the fuel delivered (i.e. the greater the reductions, the greater the number of certificates issued). Suppliers can either use their certificates to demonstrate that they have complied with their obligations or trade them to other suppliers.

HEFA Caps (2027 onwards):

SAF produced through hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) can contribute 100% of SAF for the first 2 years of the Mandate and thereafter decreasing to 71% in 2030 and 35% in 2040.

This is due primarily to HEFA’s emission reduction inefficiencies (when compared to SAF alternatives) and feedstock sustainability concerns.

Power to Liquid (PtL) Obligations (2028-2040):

A separate PtL obligation requires 0.2% of UK aviation fuel to be sourced from PtL commencing in 2028 and thereafter rising to 4.4% by 2040.

PtL requires energy-derived production of aviation fuels (from e.g. green hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide).

Buy-out Mechanism (2025 onwards):

Fuel suppliers unable to meet their SAF Mandate requirements must pay a buy-out price determined by their SAF or PtL shortfall amounts.

The aim is to create a financial incentive to prioritize SAF, with the buy-out prices (currently £4.70 per litre for SAF and £5.00 per litre for PtL) being set at a level to encourage the supply of SAF over the use of the buy-out.

SAF Revenue Support

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Revenue Support Mechanism) Bill (2024) was announced in the King’s speech on 17 July 2024, proposing a revenue certainty mechanism for SAF producers investing in UK-based facilities. A number of funding options were proposed and, in January 2025, the UK Government confirmed that the Guaranteed Strike Price mechanism was the preferred option.

The Guaranteed Strike Price is envisaged to operate akin to a contract-for-difference (as utilised in the UK renewable power sector), offering price stability for UK SAF producers. The mechanism will operate through a private law contract between a UK SAF producer and a designated Government agency, establishing a strike price (being the guaranteed price the producer will receive for eligible SAF over a specified period). If the reference price surpasses the strike price, the producer reimburses the Government agency for the difference, and, if the reference price falls below the strike price, the Government agency compensates the producer for the shortfall.

In line with the “polluter pays” principle, the UK Government has confirmed that it intends for the revenue certainty mechanism to be funded by aviation fuel suppliers.

Further SAF Incentives

To further promote UK SAF development, the UK Government has implemented various financial incentives:

Advanced Fuels Fund: First launched in 2022 with £165 million of grant funding available, the Advanced Fuels Fund aims to support the establishment and development of first-of-a-kind SAF projects in the UK.

SAF Clearing House: Any new aviation fuel must meet strict specifications and undergo testing to meet industry standards; the cost and complexity of which can be a significant barrier to new fuels entering the market. The UK SAF Clearing House provides technical support and funding to SAF producers.

Furthermore, aircraft operators can reduce their obligations under the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) by using eligible SAF, which qualifies for emissions reductions under the scheme.

Projections and Insight

It is estimated that, by 2050, the global aviation industry will need approximately 400 million tonnes of SAF annually to meet international decarbonization goal and, whilst the SAF market is still in a nascent stage of its development, the UK is positioned to play a significant role in the global effort to decarbonize aviation. The development of SAF production facilities in the UK are key for the successful implementation of the UK Government’s SAF goals.

The SAF Mandate has only just come into force and the revenue certainty mechanism for SAF producers has yet to be finalized and take effect. As such it remains to be seen whether these mechanisms will be sufficient to meet international decarbonization goals and position the UK as a leader in SAF development, production, commercialisation and use:

The success of the buy-out mechanism in incentivizing the production and use of SAF will depend on the future production costs of SAF. Whilst the buyout rates are currently projected to exceed SAF production costs, if the buy-out price is set too low (for example, if production costs spiral), suppliers may choose to simply pay the buy- out price.

With respect to the revenue certainty mechanism, there are a number of questions and policy decisions that remain outstanding: what will be used as the “reference price” (unlike in the power market where there is a published market price for electricity, no such benchmark exists for SAF)? How will the strike price adjust over time? Precisely how will the mechanism be funded? At a most fundamental level, the deployment of significant capital into SAF development will require further clarity regarding the revenue certainty mechanism.

For further clarity on the information above, we set out below (at Figure 1) a timeline of key projected regulatory developments in the UK SAF market.

Current Status and Future Developments

Despite efforts to curb its growth, commercial flights in the EU could rise by up to 42% by 2040 compared to 2017. Recognizing the pressing need to address the climate impact of the aviation sector, the EU has prioritized the development of a SAF market. By leveraging the collective action potential of its member states, the EU is uniquely positioned to lead in SAF implementation.

SAF is defined by the EU as a “drop-in” aviation fuel, including advanced biofuels or biofuels produced from sustainable feedstocks, recycled carbon fuels, or synthetic fuels.

With mandates introduced in 2023 and effective as from January 2025, the European Union is meticulously crafting a policy framework to stabilize the SAF market, foster innovation, and create a level playing field, driving progress toward its Fit-to-55 climate goals.

Legislation

The European regulatory framework for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been shaped by two key legislative milestones: the Renewable Energy Directives (RED) and the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation.

The RED have progressively established binding renewable energy targets across the EU, including for the transport sector, and have increasingly integrated SAF into the broader energy transition strategy. From RED I (2009), which set initial renewable energy targets, to RED II (2018), which introduced incentives for SAF, and finally RED III (2023), which reinforced sector-specific mandates, these directives have paved the way for SAF regulation.

Complementing this framework, the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, adopted in 2023, marks a decisive shift in SAF development by imposing direct obligations on fuel suppliers at EU airports. Unlike the RED directives, this regulation is immediately applicable across the EU and imposes a progressive incorporation of SAF into jet fuel, with binding quotas extending to 2050. Together, these two instruments define the roadmap for SAF deployment, balancing long-term policy incentives with immediate regulatory requirements.

RED Directives

RED served as the cornerstone for establishing the EU’s shift toward greener fuels.

Adopted on April 23, 2009, the RED I Directive introduced ambitious renewable energy targets across EU Member States:

General Targets: Each Member State was assigned a binding target to achieve 20% renewable energy in its final energy consumption by 2020. These targets varied for each country: Some countries were optimistic about their renewable energy potential and set ambitious targets, such as Sweden with 49% by 2020, Denmark with 30%, and France with 23%. Others, however, were more cautious, with the Netherlands setting a target of 14% and Italy aiming for 17%.

Transport Sector: A specific target of 10% renewable energy was set for the transport sector by 2020. This included biofuels and other renewable fuels but did not explicitly address aviation.

Impact on SAF: While RED I did not explicitly include SAF, it established a foundation for their future integration by defining sustainability criteria and promoting advanced biofuels.

Entering into force on December 11, 2018, the RED II Directive strengthened the EU’s renewable energy framework in response to increased climate ambitions:

Revised Targets: The overall binding target for emissions reduction was raised to 32%, with a renewable energy target of 14% for the transport sector.

Promotion of SAF

Advanced Biofuels and RFNBOs: The RED II Directive encouraged the use of advanced biofuels and Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs), explicitly including SAF. Advanced biofuels refer to biofuels produced from feedstocks that do not compete with food production or contribute to land-use changes that could negatively impact biodiversity. They are typically derived from waste and residues, or non-food crops such as algae and plant fibers. As for RFNBOs, they are fuels produced from renewable electricity rather than biological sources.

Incentive Multipliers

Biofuels derived from feedstocks listed in Annex IX (including advanced biofuels) count twice their energy content towards renewable targets, meaning that for every unit of energy produced from these fuels, it counts as two units towards the target.

Fuels supplied to the aviation sector (including RFNBOs) count as 1.2 times their energy content, meaning that for every unit of energy from these fuels, it counts as 1.2 units toward the target.

Limitations on Food-Based Biofuels: These are capped at 7% to mitigate adverse effects on land use and food production.

Adopted on October 18, 2023, the RED III Directive was a decisive step towards integrating SAF into the EU’s energy framework, by:

Enhanced Targets: The share of renewable energy in the EU’s overall energy consumption must reach 42.5% by 2030, with a binding target of 29% for the transport sector.

Sectoral Sub-Targets: Specific targets were introduced for advanced biofuels and RFNBOs, solidifying SAF’s role as a cornerstone of aviation decarbonization.

Aviation Catalyst: RED III emphasized increased SAF integration into national energy strategies while supporting emerging technologies, such as synthetic fuels.

Directives are legal acts that generally need be transposed into national law by EU member states, meaning that each country must adopt its own legislation to achieve the directive’s objectives. Therefore, the RED directives’ provisions need to be transposed into national law. There is generally an 18-month deadline for member states to do so, with an occasionally shorter deadline for some provisions.

Member States successfully met the RED I targets, despite varying national goals, demonstrating the EU’s commitment to renewable energy. This progress laid the foundation for the more ambitious targets in RED II and RED III, and Member States are on track to achieve these goals. In particular, the push for SAF under these directives is progressing well, with ongoing efforts to scale production and expand infrastructure. While challenges remain, Member States are well- positioned to meet the targets for both renewable energy and SAF by 2030, especially with the introduction of the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation.

ReFuelEU Aviation regulation

Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of October 18, 2023 through ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport (ReFuelEU Aviation) represents a cornerstone of the EU’s strategy to decarbonize aviation in line with the Green Deal objectives and the Fit-for-55 package. This regulation establishes a comprehensive legal framework to accelerate the adoption of SAF across the EU.

Finalized in 2023, most of its provisions entered into force on 1 January 2024, with Articles 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 becoming applicable from January 1, 2025. As an EU regulation, ReFuelEU Aviation is directly applicable in all Member States without requiring transposition into national law.

The regulation imposes binding SAF blending obligations on aviation fuel suppliers, requiring them to progressively integrate SAF into the aviation fuel supplied at EU airports. The mandated SAF share begins at 2% in 2025 and will increase incrementally to 70% by 2050, of which a dedicated sub-target for synthetic aviation fuels starts at 0.7% in 2030, reaching 35% by 2050 (see Figure 2). For instance, the goal for 2040 is to achieve a 42% share of SAF in the aviation fuel supplied to EU airports, with 15% of that being synthetic.

To be eligible, SAF must comply with the sustainability and emissions reduction criteria set out in RED I. Acceptable SAF sources include advanced biofuels, synthetic fuels derived from renewable hydrogen, and recycled carbon aviation fuels. Fuel suppliers may also utilize hydrogen for direct aircraft propulsion or synthetic low-carbon fuels.

Within this regulatory framework, synthetic fuels—particularly e-kerosene—are set to play an increasingly prominent role, with a specific mandate ensuring their integration into the fuel mix.

EU airport operators are required to facilitate access to SAF, while aviation fuel suppliers, airports, and aircraft operators must systematically collect and report data to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and national competent authorities to ensure regulatory compliance.

The regulation further establishes enforcement mechanisms, designating national competent authorities responsible for supervision. Fuel suppliers failing to meet their SAF blending obligations will face financial penalties and must compensate for any shortfall by supplying the missing volume the following year.

By setting clear, long-term SAF quotas through 2050, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation creates a stable and predictable market framework, reinforcing the EU’s ambition to achieve a more sustainable aviation sector.

Incentives for SAF Production and Innovation

The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and Financial Incentives for SAF

In addition to the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, the EU’s climate strategy for the aviation sector is reinforced by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), established under Directive 2003/87/EC. As a “cap-and-trade” mechanism, the EU ETS aims to progressively reduce greenhouse gas emissions by setting a cap on total emissions while allowing market- based trading of emission allowances. Initially, free allowances were allocated to aircraft operators based on the average emission of the sector and their historical performance. In 2023, approximately 22.5 million aviation allowances were allocated for free, while about 5.7 million were auctioned.

To accelerate decarbonization, the EU has initiated a phased reduction of free emission allowances for aircraft operators:

In 2024, free allowances were reduced by 25%;

In 2025, they will be further cut by 50%;

By 2026, all free allowances will be phased out, requiring operators to fully cover their emissions through auctioning.

This transition is designed to incentivize the adoption of SAF, as airlines can lower their compliance costs by integrating SAF into their fuel mix. To support this shift, the EU has introduced targeted financial incentives within the EU ETS framework:

A dedicated SAF allowance mechanism provides 20 million allowances (valued at approximately €1.7 billion) until 2030, rewarding aircraft operators based on SAF usage. This mechanism helps bridge the price gap between conventional aviation fuel and SAF. SAF remains significantly more expensive to produce. However, by reducing compliance costs for airlines under the EU ETS, it makes SAF adoption more financially viable, supporting the transition to cleaner aviation fuels while maintaining competitiveness in the sector.

SAF that meets RED sustainability criteria is attributed zero emissions under the EU ETS, reducing the number of allowances airlines must purchase.

Beyond emissions trading, the EU has also introduced monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) measures for non-CO₂ aviation effects, with additional policy proposals expected by 2028.

Financial Support Mechanisms for SAF Development

Recognizing the financial and technological challenges associated with SAF production, the EU has established several funding instruments to support research, innovation, and large-scale deployment:

EU Innovation Fund (EUIF): A €40 billion fund aimed at de-risking SAF production across various technology readiness levels. For example, the Innovation Fund awarded in 2023 a €167 million grant to the Biorefinery Östrand project, which seeks to develop, construct, and operate the world’s first large-scale biorefinery dedicated to producing renewable SAF and naphtha, in Östrand, Sweden.

Horizon Europe: The EU’s flagship €95.5 billion research and innovation program, which funds SAF-related projects.

InvestEU: A €26.2 billion initiative supporting sustainable infrastructure investments, including SAF production facilities. One of the most notable projects funded by InvestEU is the INERATEC synthetic fuel production facility in Frankfurt. Backed by a €70 million investment, this initiative is supported by a €40 million venture loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and a €30 million non-repayable grant from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. The funding will help develop Europe’s largest carbon-neutral synthetic fuel plant, set to open in 2025.

Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking: A €1.7 billion public-private partnership between the European Commission and the aeronautics industry to accelerate the development of new aviation technologies.

Projections and Insight

While the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation establishes a robust framework and clear mandates for SAF adoption, several policy areas will require further clarification and potential amendments. The regulation’s overall timeline is generally aligned with industry expectations, but additional interventions may be necessary to ensure a smooth and effective implementation:

Penalty enforcement and cost volatility: The current penalty mechanism for suppliers failing to meet SAF quotas is directly tied to SAF costs, which remain highly volatile due to potential supply shortages. If SAF prices surge, penalties could become unsustainable, adding financial pressure on suppliers while delaying compliance. Additionally, without a price cap mechanism, rising SAF costs could impact air travel affordability, potentially triggering public and industry backlash.

Exploring a tradable SAF system: Under Article 15 of ReFuelEU, the European Commission is mandated to assess additional measures to enhance SAF market liquidity and ensure supply stability. One key consideration is the creation of a book-and-claim system, which would enable fuel suppliers and aircraft operators to purchase SAF credits and allocate them flexibly across EU airports. As of January 2025, the Commission’s report on these measures remains pending.

Beyond regulatory refinements, the political landscape in the EU is evolving, with recent electoral shifts favoring parties historically opposed to Green Deal policies. As EU policymakers shift their focus toward an Industrial Deal, maintaining strong momentum for SAF adoption will be critical. Ensuring a stable regulatory environment and continued financial support will be essential to securing the long-term success of SAF integration within the aviation sector.

The effectiveness of SAF regulations in the EU stems from the fact that they are binding, compelling operators to take immediate action and enhance their performance.

Despite its relatively high cost, airlines and operators are eager to contribute and even exceed their obligated SAF targets as early as possible. They understand that this is the only way to assert themselves in the market and to ensure the long- term sustainability and viability of the industry, which must adapt to greener practices to secure its future.

United States of America

The U.S. SAF Landscape

Current Status and Future Developments

Aviation represents roughly 3.3% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and jet fuel consumption is forecasted to increase by 2-3% annually through to 2050. This obviously presents significant opportunities for SAF investment, and the market has responded: projects have been announced in recent years that are projected to meet over 10% of U.S. jet fuel demand. Nonetheless, the biggest challenge SAF faces in the U.S. is that it is not cost-competitive with fossil jet fuel. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, SAF currently costs two to ten times more than fossil jet fuel. Consequently, the federal and state incentives discussed in this section are playing and will continue to play a critical role in the growth of SAF in the U.S.

Federal Support for SAF

The U.S. government supports SAF development in several ways: annual renewable fuel regulatory mandates; tax policy; and grants. Several of these incentives are in flux, however, given the shift in the balance of political power in the U.S. Congress and the White House.

Regulatory Mandates:

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issues annual regulations under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program that require the national pool of transportation fuel to contain a certain percentage of alternative fuels such as SAF. Production and use of biofuels under these mandates is tracked using a system of tradeable credits (Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs). Among other requirements, eligible SAF must have lifecycle GHG emissions that are at least 50% below a 2005 fossil fuel baseline.

Although compliance with the program’s mandates falls on fossil fuel producers and importers, RINs implicitly subsidize biofuels such as SAF. Depending upon the feedstock and production process, SAF can generate RINs that may be used to meet the biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel or cellulosic biofuel mandates and value of the RIN varies by type. RINs generated by producing SAF can be “stacked” with federal tax credits for SAF, such as those provided by the 2022 IRA, as well as state credits relevant to SAF.

Tax Policy:

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) has a significant impact on the SAF market in the U.S. by offering comprehensive support to encourage the production and adoption of this fuel. Instead of setting mandates, the IRA offers SAF credits for qualified neat fuels and provides grants for SAF production and distribution.

The IRA supports SAF through two credits. First, IRA created a new SAF blender’s tax credit under Internal Revenue Code section 40B, available through to the end of 2024. Then, from January 1, 2025 through to December 31, 2027, the IRA made available a new technology neutral production credit for clean fuels including SAF, the section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit.

The section 45Z credit provides a tax credit for the production of clean fuels that are “suitable for use in a highway vehicle or aircraft” and meet a specified threshold for emissions reductions. The credit is worth up to $1.00 per gallon for transportation fuels and $1.75 or more per gallon for SAF, provided that prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met. The 45Z credit is claimed by the producers of SAF, rather than the blenders, but can be transferred or sold to third parties as a means of monetizing the credit.

Since August 2022, significant work has been done by a multi-disciplinary task force including the U.S. Treasury, the IRS, the Energy Department, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the White House to implement the section 45Z credit and publish tax guidance. Most recently, on January 10, 2025, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released Notice 2025-10 and Notice 2025-11, establishing an intent to propose regulations and clarifying annual emissions rates for the credit. At the same time, the 119th Congress is currently reviewing tax legislation that may include revisions to several clean energy tax credits established by the IRA, including section 45Z. As a result, airlines, SAF producers, and conventional energy companies are queuing up to talk to Congress and Trump tax officials about the future of federal tax support for clean fuels, since the current production credit is set to expire at the end of 2027.

Grants:

IRA Section 40007 establishes a grant program for eligible U.S. entities involved in SAF production, transportation, blending, or storage, administered by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through the Fueling Aviation’s Sustainable Transition (FAST) grants program.

Section 324 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for 2023 allows the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to pilot SAF usage, with a plan to be implemented by FY2028, while permitting waivers under certain conditions.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023 and 2024 authorize discretionary grants for airport infrastructure that supports SAF’s distribution and storage, provided they meet the 50% lifecycle GHG reduction requirement.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Energy for America program also provides grants and loan guarantees to rural businesses and agricultural producers for renewable energy projects, including SAF production facilities.

State Incentives for SAF Production and Innovation

State-level policies further support SAF production and consumption by allowing producers to generate and sell credits to fossil jet fuel suppliers. In 2009, California established the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) to reduce transportation sector GHG emissions in the state and develop a range of low- carbon and renewable alternatives to reduce petroleum dependency. This market-based program sets an annual average carbon intensity (CI) benchmark for all fuels – fossil and renewable – produced or imported into the state. Fuels with a CI below the benchmark (such as eligible SAF) generate credits that producers can sell to other fuel producers in the state as a revenue stream. Oregon, Washington, and New Mexico have adopted similar fuel programs.

In other states – Illinois, Minnesota, and Nebraska – per-gallon SAF production tax credits promote SAF alignment with national objectives.

Projections and Insight

By 2030, domestic SAF production is expected to reach 3 billion gallons annually – a 130-fold increase from 2030 consumption. By 2050, production could rise to 35 billion gallons per year, reflecting a 12-fold increase from the 2030 target.

The shift towards SAF represents a long-term transition in the aviation industry. Given the international nature of air travel, SAF is a clean fuel whose market drivers are largely insulated from the political swings of the US; and American airlines and airports will need to access this fuel to comply with global emissions standards. Driven by discretionary grants from the FAA, significant investments in airport infrastructure for SAF distribution and storage are anticipated. This could lead to an improved supply chain and logistics, facilitating broader SAF availability at major airports by 2025. Increased funding through grants and tax credits may accelerate research and development of new SAF feedstocks and production technologies, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs. This could also lead to advancements in alternative feedstocks, potentially doubling production efficiency by 2030. As government initiatives and incentives ramp up, it is likely that the market share of SAF in total jet fuel consumption will increase significantly from the current less than 0.1%. Projections estimate reaching 5 -10% market share by 2030, depending on regulatory support and industry adoption.

The incentives enacted under the IRA constitute a good beginning in establishing the support necessary for overcoming barriers to SAF adoption. With investors comparing the short three-year timeline of the IRA’s section 45Z clean fuel production credit to ten-year timelines for other clean energy technologies, producers and airlines are making a long-term legislative extension of the credit a top priority for 2025. State level initiatives, like the California LCFS program, look to play a critical role in driving SAF adoption. Other states may follow suit, creating a patchwork of supportive policies that could incentivize producers while also fostering competition among states for SAF leadership.

Conclusion: Comparative Analysis of SAF

Regulatory Frameworks in the UK, EU, and US

The regulatory approaches adopted by the UK, EU, and US to promote SAF reflect distinct policy priorities, economic

structures, and aviation market dynamics. Whilst all three jurisdictions recognize the need to scale SAF production to achieve net-zero aviation emissions, their methods for incentivization, mandate enforcement, and industry engagement exhibit some notable divergences.

Key Similarities

Despite differences in policy mechanisms, several overarching themes emerge across all three jurisdictions:

Mandatory Blending Requirements: The UK, EU, and US each employ a mix of blending mandates and incentives to encourage SAF adoption. The UK’s SAF Mandate (starting at 2% in 2025 and increasing to 22% by 2040) aligns with the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which also begins at 2% in 2025 but escalates to 70% by 2050. Although the US lacks a direct federal blending mandate, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and state-level Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) programs create market-driven demand for SAF.

Financial Incentives: Each jurisdiction incorporates financial incentives to lower SAF’s production costs and bridge the price gap with fossil-based jet fuel. The UK’s proposed Revenue Support Mechanism, the EU’s SAF Allowance Mechanism under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), and the US’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits all aim to de-risk SAF investment. Notably, the US offers the most aggressive tax-based support via the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which directly rewards SAF producers.

Technology-Specific Targets: Recognizing the need for diversification in SAF production pathways, the UK and EU establish dedicated quotas for Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels and synthetic fuels, whereas the US allows greater flexibility in feedstocks, as seen in its Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and LCFS programs. The UK’s PtL obligation has similar aims to the EU’s sub-target for synthetic fuels, indicating a shared commitment to emerging technologies.

Market-Based Compliance Mechanisms: Each jurisdiction incorporates a credit trading system to enhance compliance flexibility. The UK’s Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs), the EU’s ETS allowances and (if to be applied) book-and-claim system, and the US’s RIN (Renewable Identification Number) market under the RFS facilitate compliance while stimulating a secondary market for SAF credits.

Key Differences

Despite these similarities, the jurisdictions differ in several key respects:

Direct v Market-Based Approach:

The EU and UK impose direct mandates on fuel suppliers, ensuring binding obligations for SAF blending. The UK’s buy-out mechanism acts as a penalty for non-compliance, while the EU enforces fines and requires compensation for missed SAF quotas.

The US primarily relies on market-driven incentives, with no direct SAF blending mandate at the federal level. Instead, state-based programs such as California’s LCFS and financial incentives like the IRA credits encourage voluntary SAF adoption.

Policy Longevity and Stability:

The EU offers the longest regulatory certainty, with ReFuelEU Aviation’s SAF mandates extending to 2050. The UK’s SAF Mandate provides clarity through 2040 but leaves open questions regarding future expansion.

The US approach is, potentially, more politically vulnerable. The IRA’s Section 45Z tax credit is set to expire by the end of 2027, raising questions about long-term investor confidence. This contrasts with the EU’s more predictable long-term regulatory trajectory.

Scope of SAF Eligibility and Feedstock Restrictions

The UK and EU impose stricter sustainability criteria, progressively limiting HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) (or similar) feedstock eligibility. The UK caps HEFA at 92% by 2027, declining to 35% by 2040, while the EU limits food-based biofuels to prevent indirect land-use impacts.

The US allows broader feedstock eligibility, including corn ethanol-derived alcohol-to-jet SAF, which the EU explicitly excludes. This reflects the political influence of the US agricultural sector, leading to a pragmatic approach to scaling SAF production with available resources.

Enforcement Mechanisms and Market Oversight

The EU employs oversight through the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and national regulatory bodies, ensuring strict compliance through direct penalties. The UK SAF Mandate will be administered by the UK’s Department for Transport and will be responsible for enforcing the scheme with power to revoke certificates or issue civil penalties.

The US relies on tax compliance mechanisms and voluntary participation in state-based LCFS (or similar) markets, which, as an incentive-driven approach results inleading to comparatively less stringent enforcement as can be expected in the EU and UK.

Comparative Insights and Future Implications

Each jurisdiction’s SAF strategy reflects its unique regulatory philosophy and economic priorities. The EU’s highly structured, mandate-driven approach aims to achieve rapid SAF integration but places cost burdens on fuel suppliers and buyers. The UK’s hybrid model, combining mandates with revenue support mechanisms, seeks to balance regulatory certainty with investment incentives. Meanwhile, the US favors a market-driven, incentive-based model, fostering innovation but opening up potential regulatory uncertainty due to shifting political landscapes.

This evolving landscape reflects a multi-faceted approach, balancing stringent emissions reduction targets with mechanisms that incentivise investment and production. The UK has introduced ambitious mandates within its Jet Zero strategy, while the EU’s Fit-to-55 package integrates SAF quotas through the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative.

Meanwhile, the USA leverages tax credits and grant programs under initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act to stimulate domestic SAF production. These diverse regulatory tools aim to address the significant challenges of scaling SAF, including high production costs, limited feedstock availability, and infrastructure constraints.

Looking ahead, international policy harmonization will be critical to ensuring the global scalability of SAF. The International Civil Aviation Organization and industry stakeholders may push for greater alignment between EU- style mandates and US-style incentives, potentially influencing future SAF policies. Additionally, ongoing bilateral agreements between the UK, EU, and US on carbon accounting, emissions reporting, and SAF certification will play a crucial role in fostering a globally integrated SAF market.

Despite their differences, the UK, EU, and US share the common goal of scaling SAF production to enable a net zero aviation future. While their paths to achieving this differ, their collective efforts will be instrumental in driving the technological and economic transformation needed for sustainable aviation. As regulatory frameworks evolve, continued cross-border collaboration and policy adjustments will be essential to maximizing SAF’s impact on global decarbonization goals.

Dive Brief:

FedEx entered an agreement to purchase 3 million gallons of blended sustainable aviation fuel from SAF and renewable diesel fuel producer Neste. The deal is the ”largest SAF purchase executed by a U.S. cargo airline at LAX to-date,” according to a Tuesday press release.

Neste will deliver 3 million gallons of 30% unblended renewable jet fuel over a year, and the blended form of its fuel will account for one-fifth of FedEx’s projected jet fuel use for the year, according to the release.

FedEx has a goal of hitting carbon neutrality by 2040, and its Chief Sustainability Officer Karen Blanks Ellis said in the release that, as the world’s largest cargo airline service, FedEx needs the SAF market to further grow and develop to hit its goal. SAF still made up less than 1% of global jet fuel use in 2024 and is growing “disappointingly slow,” according to the International Air Transport Association.

Dive Insight:

This deal represents FedEx’s first major deployment of SAF in the U.S., the company said. Blanks Ellis said in the release that the aviation network is Fedex’s largest user of fuels globally and, thus, represents its “biggest opportunity to drive down emissions.” Nearly 60% of the company’s operational emissions come from jet fuel use, according to the company’s sustainability page.

In its unblended form, Neste’s unblended SAF can represent an 80% greenhouse gas emissions reduction over its lifecycle, compared to conventional jet fuel, the release said. It is not immediately clear how much of a GHG reduction the blended SAF represents. Neste’s SAF is made entirely from renewable waste and raw material residue like animal fat waste and used cooking oil.

“Procuring SAF is an important component of our aviation emissions-reduction strategy in the coming years, and we are pleased to have executed a deal with Neste to begin using this fuel in our air operations,” Blanks Ellis said.

FedEX CEO of Airlines Richard Smith, also the chief operating officer for international operations, said the cargo company’s first U.S. deployment will help bolster “the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF.” However, he also acknowledged that further growth is needed in the market.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/S4M6mmMajQBrY0U0WNUO5ty1Qs2LbwYgHKQxYExwWu4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDEwMTAwMzM5LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-21 12:56:35.647140

At CAPA’s Airline Leader Summit on 9th May, IATA Director General Willie Walsh said that a significant change in approach is required if the aviation industry is to achieve interim targets on the 2050 Net Zero roadmap.

The increasing use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a critical aspect of this. Its ever-evolving regulations significantly affect multiple operational departments within airlines, adding complexity to procurement, accounting, reporting, fuel management and other functions. Across the industry, the resulting challenges for airlines are compounded by inaccurate or fragmented fuel and cost data which impacts compliance, sustainability, efficiency and profitability.

Strategic data transformation is essential for the industry to hit Net Zero milestones, unlock real sustainability and achieve efficient compliance.

Inaccurate emissions data impacts not only airlines but also their corporate customers’ Scope 3 reporting, with many participating in sustainability and offset schemes as part of their own Net Zero commitments.

Because they rely on airlines to provide accurate emissions figures for business travel, any errors or inconsistencies in airline reporting can lead to flawed carbon accounting on the customer side — potentially resulting in failed audits, accusations of greenwashing​​​​, or even disqualification from environmental certification programs.

Airlines are making huge investments in SAF and new aircraft, but legacy systems and inaccurate data makes an already complex task even more difficult. Together, these paint an incomplete picture for every aspect of SAF management.

Lee Ann Shay:

Welcome to the BCA Podcast, and greetings from Geneva, Switzerland, where it's the European Business Aviation Association's annual event, EBACE. I'm Lee Ann Shay, Aviation Week's Executive Editor for MRO and Business Aviation. And I'm here with my colleagues Molly McMillin and Thierry Dubois. Molly is the managing editor of Business Aviation for Aviation Week, and Thierry is our European technology editor and our France Bureau chief. Molly and Thierry, welcome. So EBACE is in a transition time having split with NBAA last year from the ownership standpoint, and it's running the event on its own this year in a new format. The association's AirOps event merged and there's no static display. Thierry, let's start with you. What's your take on the activity and mood here?

Thierry Dubois:

Well, we miss the static display—as one exhibitor says, it's a magnet, so a magnet is missing. But the really good thing is you can still have the various useful conversations you can have with other players in business aviation, and really, when you are an actor in this industry, this is what you are looking for at EBACE—such as sharing best practices, hearing about new challenges and how to solve them. There were some very good panels. The thing we are really missing also is program updates. So technology updates by airframers and engine manufacturers, but again, the operational side for the operators and all the planes in the industry is really good.

Lee Ann Shay:

Molly, how about you?

Molly McMillin:

When you go out onto the floor, it's noticeably smaller, but it seems busy. There are fewer exhibitors, but as you mentioned, the show is in transition, so there's a big question of where might it be next year, but they came out strong on the eve of the show to say they will be back next year, and that on June 30 they will announce where it will be and some more of the details. So it's kind of wait and see, but more to come.

Lee Ann Shay:

And Thierry brought up AirOps, there's a lot of operations events and safety, which is new because this year the AirOps event was merged with EBACE. So that has been a really interesting part of this, too. Another new part is the Association Village. Thierry, you spent some time there today. Tell us about it.

Thierry Dubois:

Yes, indeed. The Association village is where national business associations are, and all the ones I talked to were very happy with the initiative, very happy with the idea. They're happy with the opportunity to meet colleagues, counterparts and see their members in a different phase. So all of them were particularly happy with the experience they had—and it was in the morning, even at the start of the show, they were already really happy, already giving good feedback, positive feedback.

Lee Ann Shay:

And kind of related to this, Molly and Thierry, what are some of the main issues that you hear about today? I've been hearing everything from taxes to RefuelEU, et cetera. What's your take?

Molly McMillin:

I spoke with Titan Aviation Fuels this afternoon, and they launched a program to help business aviation operators comply with Europe's complex RefuelEU mandate. The mandate was introduced just in January and it requires operators who fly more than 500 flights a year to uplift a 2% blend of sustainable aviation fuel at designated airports. There are more than 60 of them in the European Union. The problem is some of the airports can't get the 2% SAF. So if you fuel there, you still pay for the 2% whether or not you received it. The other problem is some airports that do have it, that they may only have one tank and that's what everyone gets. So you may not fall under the mandate, but you still have to have the fuel with the 2% SAF. So you're paying more for the fuel, whether or not you need it. And so they've already noticed a change in behavior where if there are two airports, one under the mandate that you have to pay for the 2% SAF and one at an airport that you don't have to pay for the 2% SAF, some operators are choosing the airport that they do not have to pay for the 2% SAF. They said, especially if you're like a charter operator or someone, that means if you pay more and your competitor isn't, then you're not competing on a level playing field.

Lee Ann Shay:

Thierry, how about you?

Thierry Dubois:

Regarding the RefuelEU problem, it [is worth remembering] that the industry pushed for the mandate—pushed for an ambitious mandate. The aviation industry in general, not specifically business aviation, pushed for the ambitious mandate. What I heard was about new taxes, such as in France, new regulations in other central Europe countries that are threatening business models. And also interestingly in the UK, apparently the British Business and General Aviation Association that's doing the legislation, [says] numbers are falling. And it has worked on the problem with the UK CAA, which is a very cooperative, and they found that the registration process is too time-consuming, with many steps, and they are trying to streamline it.

Lee Ann Shay:

So kind of related to that, Thierry, I was talking with Glenn Hogben, who's the Air Charter Association CEO. The Air Charter Association is based in London. And he said that the number of charter operators has definitely dropped since Brexit and they're expanding actually to the U.S. But one of the problems, you had mentioned taxes, he mentioned the solidarity tax in France, which took effect on March 1st. And I looked up the numbers and it's pretty crazy—a charter flight on a business jet with 19 seats or less, flying 1,000 to 5,500 km could face a tax rate per passenger of €1,050. And the UK also, like you mentioned, increased the air passenger duty rates in April by 13% for most charter flights. And the association is lobbying and working with the UK Treasury just to try not to have that continue to increase.

Thierry Dubois:

In France, we don't have numbers, we don't have a [sense of the] massive impact on business solution yet. The impact is starting to become visible on commercial aviation.

Lee Ann Shay:

Molly and Thierry, would you agree by having the Association Village here and the national authorities, EBAA working together and EASA, I was on a safety communications panel today and it was the first time that the safety analyst from EASA had been here and he thought it was just a fantastic opportunity and he was really excited just to be able to talk with the operators, to talk with so many people in the business aviation—really kind of open up that communication. Do you feel that maybe this new format is going to facilitate that?

Thierry Dubois:

It's too early to tell. Let's wait another couple of days.

Molly McMillin:

I think one thing that they brought out the eve before the show opened was the importance of having strong advocates for the industry, especially with all the regulations and taxation that the industry needs an EBACE, and it needs strong advocates—thus the Association Village, it was the right time to put them together so they could show their strength or show the industry the strength that it has with them.

Lee Ann Shay:

Yeah, good point. And other people I talked to today agreed that at least—granted, again, this is a small sample size of the entire industry—but a lot of the people I talked to do think that they want EBACE to succeed and there's a need for this event. So I guess we have to stay tuned and find out how it evolves and wait until June 30th when the association announces where 2026 will be. So hey, we've got to go, unfortunately. But Thierry, you're on the move. We thank you so much for your time because I know that this recording has been kind of tricky for you.

Thierry Dubois:

It's my pleasure.

Lee Ann Shay:

Thank you. And Molly, thank you for being here. That's a wrap for this BCA podcast. Don't miss the next episode by subscribing to the BCA Podcast wherever you listen.

,,2025-05-21 16:20:47+00:00,Hydrocarbon Engineering,Infinium announces construction of e-fuel production facility - Hydrocarbon Engineering,Oliver Kleinschmidt,,,,,https://www.hydrocarbonengineering.com/clean-fuels/21052025/infinium-announces-construction-of-e-fuel-production-facility/,"Infinium, a major producer of commercially available e-fuels, has announced that construction is underway on its second US-based e-fuels production site, known as Project Roadrunner.
The site is expected to become the world’s largest e-fuels production facility when operational, producing 23 000 tpy (7.6 million gal.)
The fuels produced by the Roadrunner project will be sold domestically in the US and exported to international markets.
This large scale system will not only produce hydrogen for the SAF facility but will also have capacity to support future hydrogen offtake opportunities.
Supported by top industry leaders in energy and infrastructure, Infinium is expanding its development of e-fuel facilities both across the US and internationally.","Infinium, a major producer of commercially available e-fuels, has announced that construction is underway on its second US-based e-fuels production site, known as Project Roadrunner.

The project, which includes investors Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, is located in Reeves County, Texas, near the city of Pecos, US.

The site is expected to become the world’s largest e-fuels production facility when operational, producing 23 000 tpy (7.6 million gal.) of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other e-fuel products for customers including global aviation leaders American Airlines and IAG, owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus, and other international airline brands.

“Infinium’s Project Roadrunner marks a huge achievement for the fuel industry,” said Infinium CEO Robert Schuetzle. “Not only will the project produce commercial SAF for its customers, it will bring highly skilled jobs and economic growth to the Pecos community and state of Texas. This project demonstrates the ongoing commitment of Infinium, its investors, and partners to help ensure that the United States remains a global leader in energy security, resilience and innovation.”

e-fuels are synthetic fuels, produced from waste CO2 and renewable energy, that are chemically identical to conventional petroleum-based fuels. These drop-in fuels are used in the transportation and chemicals sectors, seamlessly integrating with existing engines, infrastructure, and manufacturing processes. Infinium e-fuels provide an opportunity for energy diversification while leveraging the global infrastructure that powers the transportation and chemicals industries today. In 2023, Infinium became the world’s first to produce and ship commercial volumes of e-fuels to customers in the US and Europe from its production facility, Project Pathfinder, in Corpus Christi, Texas.

The Roadrunner project reached financial close with investments from Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and is now under construction. The project represents significant investment in the region and will support highly skilled direct labour jobs in construction, fabrication, operations, and logistics locally and across Texas. Commercial agreements for the project – including feedstock, vendor and offtake contracts – have been structured and de-risked to attract the infrastructure capital and debt required for the continued scaling of the e-fuels market.

Infinium’s Project Roadrunner facility will convert waste CO2 and renewable energy to produce SAF, leveraging new renewable power assets purpose-built for the project. The fuels produced by the Roadrunner project will be sold domestically in the US and exported to international markets. Under a landmark agreement with airline group IAG, the SAF will be shipped to the UK to satisfy compliance requirements under the recently enacted UK SAF Mandate which requires that at least 10% of all jet fuel in flights taking off from the UK is sourced from sustainable feedstocks by 2030.

“The construction of Project Roadrunner represents a real step forward in the production of SAF at scale,” said Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s Group Sustainability Officer. “We’re proud to be an early customer of Infinium’s SAF and working hard to procure and invest in SAF to deliver our 10% 2030 SAF goal. The aviation industry is making progress, but continued support and stronger incentives are necessary to accelerate production at the scale and pace required to ensure a long-term, affordable supply.”

Currently under construction, the facility is expected to reach commercial operations in 2027.

""We are pleased to support Infinium’s Roadrunner project, which reflects a significant step forward for an emerging new market for renewable electricity,” commented Petter Skantze, Senior Vice President, Infrastructure Development for NextEra Energy Resources. “The US has tremendous potential to use its abundant energy resources to serve global demand, and we’re excited to expand our investment in Texas to enable Infinium’s industry-leading electro-fuels production facility.""

Infinium selected leading electrolyser manufacturer Electric Hydrogen to supply its complete 100 MW HYPRPlant solution for the project, which will be integrated on site for green hydrogen production. This large scale system will not only produce hydrogen for the SAF facility but will also have capacity to support future hydrogen offtake opportunities.

“Infinium’s Project Roadrunner stands as a remarkable example of how next-generation technologies can rapidly evolve from proof-of-concept to finance-ready infrastructure,” added Mario Fernandez, Head of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. “At BE Catalyst, we are proud to have partnered with Infinium from the onset to help shape this project, positioning it to attract the necessary infrastructure capital required to scale and accelerate the delivery of e-fuels into the market.”

“Our investments in Infinium and Project Roadrunner are the first Brookfield has committed to sustainable aviation fuel,” stated Laura Hellman, Senior Vice President at Brookfield. “We are excited about our partnership with Infinium which will help advance sustainability within the aviation sector consistent with the goals of our investment strategy.”

The Roadrunner project underscores expanded support for innovative solutions that meet the market’s growing demand for resilient energy supply chains, while decarbonising and utilising products that leverage the existing infrastructure and engines in use today. By enabling e-fuels to be used as pure fuel or blended with petroleum-based products, Infinium solutions can be used to significantly reduce the overall carbon footprint of the energy supply chain. Supported by top industry leaders in energy and infrastructure, Infinium is expanding its development of e-fuel facilities both across the US and internationally. This growth will not only contribute to the expansion and diversification of fuel market supply options but also offer low-carbon alternatives to augment conventional fuels relied on today.",https://dlgivnpf6gg8w.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/294918.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 16:57:03.830885

About €10.5 billion of U.S. aircraft were sold to EU airlines and aircraft leasing companies in 2024 alone.
The engines are manufactured in the UK and will be allowed to enter the United States tariff-free.
As part of the trade deal, the UK is slated to buy $10 billion in Boeing aircraft.
This adds to the 149 Boeing aircraft backlog for UK purchasers.","Reports indicate that key airlines, including Ryanair, are reconsidering their procurement pipelines and the feasibility of long-term order books with manufacturers in the United States. Ryanair’s order book of Boeing deliveries is valued at over $30 billion and comprises 330 aircraft for delivery through 2034. Following the introduction of a baseline tariff on Chinese imports of 145%, a Chinese airline refused delivery of new Boeing aircraft and at least three aircraft were repatriated to the United States. As a result of the ongoing trade negotiations between China and the United States, the baseline tariff has been reduced to 30% for a 90-day period, and China has reportedly removed the delivery ban with officials said to have informed airlines and government agencies that Boeing deliveries can resume. Boeing historically sent 25% of its ex-factory aircraft to China, and although its share has diminished as Airbus increased its position in China, Boeing’s order backlog with Chinese airlines stands at 10% of its pipeline, and Boeing had planned to deliver around 50 new aircraft to China during the rest of 2025. Globally, 80% of Boeing’s delivery pipeline for 2025 is for non-U.S. customers.

The EU is considering imposing a tariff on Boeing imports if the United States persists with its 10% tariff on EU-manufactured aircraft, parts and components. About €10.5 billion of U.S. aircraft were sold to EU airlines and aircraft leasing companies in 2024 alone. Airbus is somewhat insulated as it has U.S. manufacturing facilities for some of its narrow body aircraft, b part and component supply chains cross multiple countries and continents, and all wide body aircraft are made in the EU.

As part of the recently announced UK-US trade deal, Rolls-Royce engines will be exempted from U.S. tariffs. The engines are manufactured in the UK and will be allowed to enter the United States tariff-free. Rolls-Royce engines are used on some models of aircraft manufactured by Boeing. As part of the trade deal, the UK is slated to buy $10 billion in Boeing aircraft. Interestingly, shortly after confirmation of this deal, British Airways owner IAG announced a new order for 32 Boeing 787-10 aircraft, and 21 Airbus A330-900neo aircraft. This adds to the 149 Boeing aircraft backlog for UK purchasers.

With tariff policies remaining in flux, anecdotally, industry participants are in holding patterns in the hope of more definitive decisions by the Trump administration. Ultimately, if tariffs persist, the increased costs of flying will be absorbed by consumers.",https://media.velaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/28180558/09ce02a2-5358-4003-870f-a255bf2bc300.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 12:56:41.135996

As we work toward our goal of carbon-neutral operations by 2040, we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.”

Richard Smith, FedEx’s chief operating officer for international and CEO for the airline, said, “As the world’s preeminent express-transportation company, our initial U.S. deployment of this fuel advances our sustainability goals and bolsters the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF. While we know further growth of the SAF market is needed—alongside other innovations—we are proud to celebrate this milestone with our world-class air network.”

Carl Nyberg, a senior vice president at Neste, added, “Neste is excited to work with FedEx and support their ambitious goal of reaching carbon-neutral operations by 2040 with our SAF. Recognizing the important role of air cargo in the global economy, FedEx is demonstrating how this industry can leverage available lower-emission solutions like SAF to reduce its environmental impact. We look forward to further strengthening our cooperation.”

This fuel purchase by FedEx builds upon years of the company’s efforts to co-create innovative sustainable aviation technologies with other industry leaders, including the ecoDemonstrator flight-test program with Boeing—the world’s first commercial airplane flight using 100 percent SAF in both engines that was conducted in 2018.

In addition to the procurement of SAF, FedEx is pursuing multiple avenues to improve efficiency and reduce fuel consumption in its aviation operations overall, including aircraft-fleet modernization, fuel-conservation initiatives and flight-planning optimization.

Collectively, fleet modernization and fuel-saving efforts enabled FedEx in fiscal year 2024 to successfully achieve its goal of a 30 percent reduction in aviation-emissions intensity from a 2005 baseline.

FedEx set its first aviation-emissions intensity-reduction goals back in 2008.

The total post-FID HEFA capacity (operational and under construction) has reached 11.1 Mt, representing 44% of the HEFA project pipeline.
Approximately 73% of the bio-SAF project pipeline and 96% of the e-SAF pipeline are still in the feasibility or pre-feasibility stage.
Europe hosts about 24% of the global SAF project pipeline, including 32% of the post-FID capacity.
Asia accounts for around 23% of the global SAF project pipeline, including about half of post-FID capacity.","Key takeaways of the April 2025 SAF update:

The total SAF project pipeline has reached 34.6 Mt, including 25.6 Mt of HEFA, 6.6 Mt of bio-SAF, and 2.4 Mt of e-SAF. Four new projects were added, while one frozen project was excluded last month.

Alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technologies account for approximately 4.7 Mt of SAF projects (14% of the project pipeline), including 3.3 Mt of ethanol-to-jet and 1.4 Mt of methanol-to-jet. About 4.3 Mt of SAF projects (12%) are based on Fischer–Tropsch technology.

North America accounts for 11.6 Mt of the SAF project pipeline (34% of the global total), Europe for 8.2 Mt (24%), Asia for 8.0 Mt (23%), and Latin America for 5.7 Mt (16%). About two-thirds of ethanol-to-jet projects and nearly half of Fischer–Tropsch projects are based in North America, while more than 80% of methanol-to-jet projects are located in Europe.

Two HEFA projects became operational in April. The total post-FID HEFA capacity (operational and under construction) has reached 11.1 Mt, representing 44% of the HEFA project pipeline. Approximately 73% of the bio-SAF project pipeline and 96% of the e-SAF pipeline are still in the feasibility or pre-feasibility stage.

In the Higher Probability Projects scenario, global SAF capacity could reach 19.0 Mt by 2030, including 16.7 Mt of HEFA, 2.1 Mt of bio-SAF, and 0.3 Mt of e-SAF.

As of April 2025, GENA tracks 217 SAF plants and projects with a total capacity of 34.6 million tons (Mt) by 2030. This includes:

109 Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) plants and projects, with a total capacity of 25.6 Mt by 2030.

53 bio-SAF plants and projects, with a total capacity of 6.6 Mt by 2030. Bio-SAF can be produced from residual biomass and municipal waste, bioethanol, biomethanol, and biogas.

55 e-SAF plants and projects, with a total capacity of 2.4 Mt by 2030. Synthetic aviation fuel, or Power-to-Liquid (PtL) aviation fuel, is produced from CO₂ and renewable hydrogen.

Four new projects were added in the last month, while one frozen project was removed from the pipeline. One e-SAF project also reduced its planned capacity. As a result, the overall project pipeline increased by 0.8 Mt compared to March 2025.

The alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) project pipeline reached 4.7 Mt in April 2025, including 3.3 Mt of ethanol-to-jet and 1.4 Mt of methanol-to-jet capacity. The Fischer–Tropsch (FT) project pipeline now stands at 4.3 Mt of SAF.

Among bio-SAF projects, approximately 54% are based on ATJ technologies, 46% on Fischer–Tropsch, and about 0.5% on catalytic hydrothermolysis (hydrothermal liquefaction). Around 54% of e-SAF projects use Fischer–Tropsch, while 46% use ATJ technologies.

North America accounts for 34% of the global SAF project pipeline (11.6 Mt), including 16% of operational capacity and projects under construction. HEFA and bio-SAF projects dominate the region. Nearly half of global Fischer–Tropsch-based SAF capacity and two-thirds of ethanol-to-jet projects are located in North America.

Europe hosts about 24% of the global SAF project pipeline, including 32% of the post-FID capacity. By 2030, the European pipeline includes 4.9 Mt of HEFA capacity, nearly 2 Mt of e-SAF, and 1.4 Mt of bio-SAF. Approximately 80% of all methanol-to-jet projects are based in Europe.

Asia accounts for around 23% of the global SAF project pipeline, including about half of post-FID capacity. Approximately 87% of the regional pipeline consists of HEFA facilities.

In April, two HEFA facilities began commercial operations: Neste Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Saffaire Sky Energy in Japan. Post-FID HEFA capacity (operational and under construction) now totals approximately 11.1 Mt, representing about 44% of the HEFA project pipeline. An additional 20% of HEFA projects are in the engineering phase. Among bio-SAF projects, 25% are in engineering and only 2.4% are post-FID. About 73% of bio-SAF and 96% of e-SAF projects remain in feasibility or pre-feasibility stages, despite strong support from SAF consumption mandates in the EU and UK.

Given the advanced development status and relatively lower costs of many HEFA projects, HEFA capacity under the Higher Probability Projects scenario could reach approximately 11.8 Mt by 2027 and 16.7 Mt by 2030. Bio-SAF projects follow with around 2.5 Mt of capacity that could become operational under the same scenario by 2030. Due to the early development stages of most e-SAF projects and the limited number of signed offtake agreements, only 0.3 Mt of e-SAF capacity is expected to be operational by 2030 in this scenario. Overall, total SAF capacity could reach 11.9 Mt in 2027 and 19 Mt in 2030.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQGg8aLgwwFL8Q/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/B4DZbsIXDlIAAI-/0/1747718337408?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ON9dWYlMAbJ5oyeJToBPi7e_yDPcz77dPxjDe3y9g5U,N,,2025-05-21 12:56:52.838083

Under the deal, IMG will own and operate the expanded solar array and sell power to Duquesne Light under a power purchase agreement, under which power will be distributed to the regional grid.
IMG already owns and operates the solar part of the microgrid and operates the gas plant that it also designed.
Earlier this year, the airport signed a lease agreement with green energy developer Avina to develop and build the sustainable aviation fuel plant.
The airport has acres of land to the south of its airfield that can be used for commercial development, he added.","The next phase of Pittsburgh International Airport's energy plan includes a solar project on otherwise unused property that will more than double its existing array and generate an additional 4.7 MW of power.

The airport, which became the first worldwide in 2021 to be entirely powered by a microgrid, announced plans late last month to partner with utility Duquesne Light Co. and IMG Energy Solutions to install 11,216 solar panels to be located adjacent to an existing 10,000-panel solar field, part of the facility's 21-MW microgrid.

The new array will be located on 12 acres of airport-owned land that was a construction debris landfill, said Jamie Habberfield, senior manager of business development at IMG, which Liberty Power Innovations acquired in March. Under the deal, IMG will own and operate the expanded solar array and sell power to Duquesne Light under a power purchase agreement, under which power will be distributed to the regional grid.

IMG already owns and operates the solar part of the microgrid and operates the gas plant that it also designed. “It is IMG's proprietary design that we used to build the plant, and we also operated it for the first four years under contract,” Habberfield said. Peoples Natural Gas, which owned the microgrid, sold the asset to Cordia in 2023.

“There's nothing hazardous in [the landfill], which was a piece of property that could not be developed for any other commercial reasons, so it was agreed by everyone involved that that was a great place to put a solar project,” Habberfield added.

Construction is expected to start in 2026, with completion anticipated in the first half of 2027. It is too early to say when EPC or specialty contractors for the project will be selected, Habberfield said, and the review process by regional grid operator PJM interconnection may not be completed until the fall.

“At that point, we will have to move forward with final budgets and financing, so we wouldn't be prepared to move forward with any contractor selection for several quarters,” he added.

Up Next

Other energy initiatives at the airport—which has completed about 90% of its $1.1 billion terminal modernization project–include development of a sustainable aviation fuel plant and an integrated hydrogen and fuel production facility.

The airport will act as a “strategic landlord” for those projects, with developers needing to enter long-term lease agreements, but with the airport not necessarily having a stake in the projects, said Chad Willis, vice president of planning, environmental and sustainability at the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which manages the Pittsburgh facility.

Earlier this year, the airport signed a lease agreement with green energy developer Avina to develop and build the sustainable aviation fuel plant. “We have been in negotiations and discussions with Avina for quite some time,” Willis said. The airport has acres of land to the south of its airfield that can be used for commercial development, he added.

Plans call for the facility to be developed in phases with the exact initial size yet to be determined, he said. “Right now the initial phase is planned to be between 25 and 50 million gallons per year of production,” Willis said. By the end of the program, the final buildout will likely be more than 100 million and up to about 125 million gallons per year.

Willis said he could not provide specific project start and end dates for the work. “We’re hoping to get to a final investment decision on the project later this year,” he said. “That will inform the construction timeline, but we’re hoping to be in construction starting in early 2026.”

Projects like the fuel plant typically take about up to 2.5 years to complete, Willis said. “We don’t have a final date quite yet when we expect to be open, but we’re hoping for late 2028 or early 2029.”

If the project goes through, the airport would score another first as the only one to produce sustainable aviation fuel on site, he said.

Last year, CNX Resources signed a letter of intent with KeyState Energy to build a $1.5-billion facility on airport property that can produce either hydrogen solely, or sustainable aviation fuel exclusively. But the project is contingent on whether the federal government “enables a pathway” for coal mine methane under Section 45V hydrogen production tax credit, part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the firm said.

Federal tax credits for clean energy production–including 45V as well as the Investment Tax Credit, which the airport’s solar expansion is eligible for, are now being heavily debated in Congress as lawmakers wrangle over the tax portion of the federal budget reconciliation bill.

CNX did not respond to requests for comment on the credits..",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/WEB-Pitt-Airport-Solar.jpg?height=635&t=1747837735&width=1200,N,,2025-05-21 11:56:51.988290

The project, which is funded from investors including Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, is located in Reeves County, Texas, near the city of Pecos. The site is expected to produce 23,000 tons per year (7.6 million gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other eFuel products for customers such as American Airlines and IAG, owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and other international airline brands, once operational in 2027.

""Not only will the project produce commercial eSAF for its customers, but it will also bring highly skilled jobs and economic growth to the Pecos community and state of Texas,” said Infinium CEO, Robert Schuetzle, in a statement. “This project demonstrates the ongoing commitment of Infinium, its investors, and partners to help ensure that the United States remains a global leader in energy security, resilience and innovation.""

Commercial agreements for the project, including feedstock, vendor and offtake contracts, have been structured and de-risked to attract the infrastructure capital and debt required for the continued scaling of the eFuels market, according to the company’s news release.

The Project Roadrunner facility will convert waste CO2 and renewable energy to produce sustainable aviation fuel, leveraging new renewable power assets purpose-built for the project. The fuels produced by the Roadrunner project will be sold domestically in the U.S. and exported to international markets.

As per an agreement with airline group IAG, the eSAF will be shipped to the UK to assure compliance requirements under the UK SAF Mandate, which requires at least 10 percent of all jet fuel in flights taking off from the UK is sourced from sustainable feedstocks by 2030.

Roadrunner has secured 150 MW of new wind generation capacity from a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources through a long-term power purchase agreement.

Infinium also has selected electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen to supply its complete 100 MW HYPRPlant solution for the project, which will be integrated on site for green hydrogen production. The system will not only produce hydrogen for the eSAF facility but will also have capacity to support future hydrogen offtake opportunities.

Hydrogen does not contain carbon in its molecular chain so does not emit CO2 when combusted. To be considered green hydrogen, it is created by electrolyzers which are powered by carbon-free energy resources such as wind, solar, hydro or nuclear.

Sustainable aviation fuel has energy density comparable to jet fuel and can be utilized as a drop-in fuel blended with the latter.

Whether you’re camping, going for a trip domestically or internationally, or even just relaxing at home, we all must maintain sustainable habits during the summer months.

Summer is a time of travel, and while most of us will not take our overseas voyages by sailboat like Greta Thunberg, there are still plenty of ways to make our travel a little more eco-friendly. These choices include (but are not limited to) the following:

Walk and bike! In the warm parts of the year, walking and biking is an excellent method of travel short distances, while providing much-needed endorphins!

While camping or hiking, make sure you abide by the rules of the park or area by being vigilant when making and extinguishing fires, and staying on the trails so you don’t tread on growing vegetation.

Use public transportation whenever possible.

Carpool with friends and family to your destinations!

If available, take the train! Trains, in most cases, are more sustainable than planes and buses.

If you’re traveling abroad, fly with airlines that are actively reducing their emissions through the use of sustainable aviation fuel, such as Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines.

Separately, we must also remember to maintain basic sustainable habits during the summer, such as sorting our trash into recycling and composting, limiting the use of single-use items (use reusable containers instead), thrift summer clothes, and reducing meat and water consumption.

Across the energy, technology, and aviation sectors, a growing number of companies are investing in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).","Imagine boarding a flight from Seattle to London, but instead of burning fossil fuel, your plane’s engine runs on fuel created — quite literally — from thin air.

It sounds like science fiction, but research labs are already working on making it happen. So far it’s on a very small scale. A new class of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pulls carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air and turns it into jet fuel, offering a glimpse into a future where aviation could be virtually emissions-free.

The catch? The price tag for these e-fuels is still sky-high.

The high cost – and potential – of e-fuels

Sustainable aviation fuel prices vary depending on how they’re made, and none of these fuels are widely used yet.

There are two main types: bio-based SAF, made from organic materials like used cooking oil and agricultural waste, and e-SAF (also known as electrofuels, e-kerosene and e-fuels), made with renewable hydrogen and CO₂ captured from the air.

E-fuels are the most expensive option, largely due to the high cost of carbon capture and electrolysis. But they hold immense promise: they could be genuinely carbon-neutral.

“Among all alternatives to fossil jet fuel, e-kerosene offers the most promising path to decarbonize the aviation sector,” says Camille Mutrelle, aviation policy officer at Transport & Environment, a European nonprofit focused on sustainable transport. “Unlike bio-based SAF, which is limited by feedstock availability and land use concerns, e-kerosene can be sustainably scaled up to meet aviation fuel demand without competing with food production.”

Lifecycle emissions for e-SAF can approach zero — especially when it’s made using CO₂ captured directly from the air and powered by renewable electricity, Mutrelle adds.

Though the market is still nascent, the first commercial flights using e-fuels, at least in part, are expected by 2030, Mutrelle says. More than 30 industrial-scale projects are already underway across Europe, and major airlines including United Airlines and IAG are beginning to invest.

“We expect broader deployment in the 2030s as production ramps up and costs fall,” Mutrelle adds.

According to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, e-fuels currently average 7,695 euros (about $8,720) per ton. Bio-based SAF is cheaper, at 2,085 euros (about $2,365) per ton, but still far more expensive than conventional jet fuel, which averages 734 euros (about $830) per ton.

This massive price gap explains why SAF adoption — especially e-fuels — has been slow.

Turning air into jet fuel

So what’s the science that could power a 280-ton Dreamliner across the Atlantic — using nothing but air, water and renewable energy?

Carbon capture fuels avoid the environmental pitfalls of traditional biofuels, which often rely on monoculture crops like sugarcane that can damage biodiversity and compete with food production.

Instead, e-fuels use CO₂ from the atmosphere (or industrial emissions), plus hydrogen extracted from water via electrolysis using renewable electricity. The result is a synthetic jet fuel that can be used in existing aircraft engines, recycling carbon instead of adding more to the atmosphere.

Among the companies pioneering this approach is Twelve, a California-based startup developing low-temperature CO₂ electrolysis. It’s an energy-efficient method of turning CO₂ and water into syngas, the foundation of fuel that’s synthetic, or simply made of something other than natural fossil resources.

“Our way is the electrochemistry way, where we’re doing CO₂ electrolysis at the front end — and we’re doing it at low temperatures,” says Ashwin Jadhav, Twelve’s vice president of business development. “There’s not many folks out there focused on that.”

This low-temp process uses less energy than traditional high-heat methods and integrates easily with wind and solar, making e-fuel production more efficient and scalable. These “air-based fuels” can reduce emissions by up to 90% compared to fossil jet fuel, without the drilling, refining, and transport pollution of oil, according to representatives at Twelve.

Twelve’s first production plant, called AirPlant One, is opening this year in Washington state and the company plans to make 50,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) annually. United Airlines is one of the major supporters helping to make this first round of mass-scale production possible. Twelve has also signed a major deal to supply 260 million gallons of SAF over 14 years to Europe’s International Airlines Group (which owns Vueling, Iberia, Aer Lingus and British Airways).

And while Twelve’s fuel hasn’t yet powered a commercial flight, the company aims to supply e-fuel for flights within the next year. Microsoft is part of a three-way partnership with Alaska Airlines and Twelve, whereby Microsoft will offset business travel emissions resulting from employees flying on Alaska Airlines.

For now, the expectation is to blend e-SAF with fossil fuels until production of e-SAF is scaled up to fill tanks. Under Europe’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, flights within Europe must use 2% SAF by 2025 and 70% by 2050 — with specific targets for e-fuel adoption along the way.

Why e-fuels aren’t taking off yet

While the technology for green skies already exists, shifting from fossil fuels to truly sustainable aviation is a long, complicated journey. Existing, longstanding investments in oil, political considerations and the pace of regulation all play a role in how quickly the transition takes flight.

“Economies of scale are needed to lower prices, but the high upfront costs discourage airlines from adopting SAF widely,” says Marina Efthymiou, a professor of aviation management at Dublin City University. “Without strong policy interventions — such as subsidies, tax credits, and mandates — the financial gap is simply too large to overcome.”

She notes that e-fuels have the highest emissions-reduction potential of any SAF — but also the steepest startup costs.

So far, most SAF usage by airlines has involved bio-based fuels, especially HEFA-SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), which are more commercially available.

In November 2023, Virgin Atlantic flew the first transatlantic flight powered entirely by sustainable fuels — made from waste fats and plant sugars. No fossil fuel. No e-fuels either. It showed that clean aviation is possible, though next-generation options like e-fuels are still too expensive and difficult to scale.

Airlines including Emirates, Cebu Pacific, Virgin Atlantic and British Airways have all flown using SAF, though details are often vague.

“Airlines aren’t always transparent about how much SAF they’re using, the blend percentage, or which type of SAF they rely on,” Efthymiou says.

Across the energy, technology, and aviation sectors, a growing number of companies are investing in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Airlines like United, Delta, Lufthansa, Japan Airlines, and Air France-KLM have committed to scaling up SAF usage, while energy giants like Shell, BP, and TotalEnergies are funding SAF production facilities.

Tech companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have pledged SAF purchases to offset business travel emissions. However, investment in electrofuels (eSAF) — produced by combining captured CO₂ and renewable electricity — is still far more limited.

Early adopters like United Airlines, Lufthansa Group, IAG (British Airways’ parent company), and Japan Airlines have signed partnerships with companies like Twelve, Infinium, and Synhelion. Because eSAF is significantly more expensive and energy-intensive to produce than bio-based SAF, corporate investment remains cautious, and large-scale deployment will depend heavily on regulatory support and technological breakthroughs.

Barriers to entry: Why e-fuels are so expensive

E-fuels are hard to make and even harder to scale. The required infrastructure — carbon capture units, electrolysis systems, fuel synthesis plants — is costly to build.

Production also demands huge amounts of renewable energy. Electrolysis, which entails using electricity to isolate hydrogen in water, alone requires large-scale green hydrogen generation, which is still developing in most regions.

“E-fuels have the potential to be the most sustainable form of SAF because they can be produced without land use, agricultural input, or waste feedstocks,” says Efthymiou. “But that depends on the source of electricity and CO₂. The sustainability promise only holds if the inputs are truly renewable.”

In short, e-fuels will only be as clean as the grid that powers them.

Still, a major upside is that e-fuels work with existing aircraft.

“Most estimates suggest e-fuels could become more cost-competitive by the mid-2030s,” Efthymiou says, “depending on renewable electricity prices, carbon pricing and technological improvements.”

Small-scale demo plants are already running — like Ineratec and Atmosfair in Germany, and Infinium and Twelve in the US.

But volumes remain tiny, and costs are high.

“Without a solid regulatory push, airlines just aren’t motivated to switch,” says Mutrelle.

The road to takeoff

Still, with continued investment, policy support, and technological advancements, experts believe that the idea of flying on fuel made from air could become a reality.

Though pragmatic about the challenges faced, many experts are optimistic.

Jonathon Counsell, head of sustainability at International Airlines Group, is one.

“Of course the ultimate goal is to take CO₂ directly from the atmosphere,” Counsell says. “At first, we’re capturing CO₂ from industrial plants to prevent it from entering the air. But the next step is direct air capture — sucking carbon out of the atmosphere itself. That’s where we really want to get to.”

He points out that SAF production has already grown from 100 tons to over a million tons in just a few years — evidence that scaling is possible.

While carbon capture fuels remain a long-term solution rather than a present reality, if governments, airlines, and innovators align, the idea of flying on fuel made from air could take off sooner than we think.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20250513-sustainable-jet-fuels-gfx.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-05-21 11:57:07.917467

Wizz Air welcomes first A321XLR with GTF engines

Wizz Air has taken delivery of the first of its 47 Airbus A321XLR aircraft, becoming the world's first operator of the A321XLR powered by Pratt & Whitney GTF engines, and the first European low-cost carrier to introduce this type.

The airline's A321XLRs are configured with 239 seats in a single-class layout and feature the newly designed Airspace cabin. This includes an innovative lighting system with multiple settings to create the ideal atmosphere throughout various phases of the journey, such as boarding, dining, relaxing, sleeping, and waking up. With the addition of the A321XLR to its fleet, Wizz Air is strengthening its capacity to link Europe and the Middle East.

Wizz Air exclusively operates Airbus aircraft and currently has a fleet of over 230 A320 Family jets in service, with a further 295 yet to be delivered.

The A321XLR represents the next evolution of the A320neo family, designed to meet market demands for extended range and increased payload, offering greater flexibility and value for operators. The aircraft boasts an extra-long range of up to 4,700 nautical miles, 30% lower fuel burn per seat compared with previous-generation rival aircraft, and reduced NOx emissions and noise levels. To date, Airbus has received over 500 orders for this model.

In line with Airbus' sustainability goals, the A321XLR is already capable of flying with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Airbus aims to achieve compatibility with 100% SAF across its fleet by 2030.

This collaboration promises to bring much-needed transparency and stability to a critical sector striving for aviation's ambitious net-zero by 2050 goal.

For decades, the aviation industry has navigated price risks in traditional fossil jet fuel markets using established price reporting services. However, the unique complexities of SAF production demand a fundamentally new approach. Unlike conventional fuels, SAF can be derived from a diverse array of certified technologies, each possessing distinct feedstocks, operational costs, CO2 reduction capabilities, and scalability. The partners emphasize that a ""one-size-fits-all"" SAF index is insufficient for this intricate and evolving market.

ATOBA Energy, recognizing the immediate need to unlock investment and build confidence in long-term offtake agreements for new SAF production facilities, has spearheaded this initiative. A key enabler, they contend, is the establishment of transparent and equitable SAF price indexes. Developed by General Index, these new indexes will be meticulously designed to reflect the unique cost profiles of various SAF technologies. These granular indexes will then be aggregated to form broader benchmarks that align with existing regulatory frameworks, regional market nuances, and overall industry needs.

Neil Bradford, CEO & Founder of General Index, underscored the criticality of this endeavor, stating, ""Creating transparent and technology-specific SAF price benchmarks is critical to scaling sustainable aviation fuel markets."" He highlighted General Index's existing role as a benchmark partner to the European Commission for the official 2024 Aviation Fuels Reference Prices for ReFuelEU Aviation, emphasizing that this partnership with ATOBA Energy will ""help build the foundational infrastructure needed to attract investment, support offtake agreements, and accelerate the aviation industry’s transition to net zero.”

Arnaud Namer, CEO & Co-Founder of ATOBA Energy, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that ""Unlocking investment in sustainable aviation fuel starts with transparency, market confidence, and trusted pricing tools."" He expressed pride in partnering with General Index to introduce a ""new generation of SAF price benchmarks tailored to the real cost structures of emerging SAF technologies."" Namer believes these benchmarks are essential for ensuring SAF remains competitively priced for airlines, an advantage ATOBA Energy aims to deliver through its diversified portfolio of best-in-class SAF producers and long-term offtake aggregation strategy.

The traditional financial model for SAF has been a significant hurdle. Producers require substantial upfront investments but struggle to secure funding without guaranteed long-term purchase contracts. Conversely, airlines, facing decarbonization mandates, hesitate to commit to purchasing from unproven technologies or volatile pricing structures.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-21 11:57:16.272564

This meant US ethanol imports were no longer subject to dumping duties that had been imposed on US exports into the bloc.
Compared with 2022, however, total US ethanol imports were just 343 million liters, or 27.6% of total UK ethanol supply, according to the UK data.","Tariff removal sparks industry concerns

The deal outlined plans to remove a tariff on US bioethanol imports into the UK. It was unveiled on May 8 and has been labelled as “disastrous”. The industry currently produces around 840 million liters of bioethanol per year.

Prior to the deal, any US ethanol imported into the UK was taxed at 19%.

The UK is currently home to two ethanol plants — Vivergo in Saltend near Hull and Ensus in Teesside. Their combined output from is equivalent to around 95% of the ethanol currently required in UK petrol. This is on a basis that the fuel must be 5.5% ethanol. And around 50% if blending was 10%, according to biofuels trade group Renewable Transport Fuel Association (RTFA).

Industry reactions and potential plant closures

Much of the industry has reacted to the news over the last few days. This includes both the chief executive of ABF Sugar, which owns Vivergo, and chairman of Ensus. Meanwhile RTFA published on social media that the tariff removal would have “catastrophic consequences” for the UK industry.

“This vital sector is now facing imminent collapse because of the trade deal,” the executives said in a joint statement on Sunday May 11, adding that “in our current situation, we will have to close these plants.”

This is despite the fact that both plants would be able to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). And do so via an alcohol-to-jet pathway. The executives highlighted it was a “central ambition of the Prime Minister’s government”. The statement followed the UK’s signing into law of the SAF mandate at the end of 2024. It required that a 2% share of SAF be blended into jet fuel in 2025. In addition, it required 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

“But without a stable domestic ethanol base, one promising route for British SAF production will struggle to take off,” the statement said.

Broader impacts on agriculture and domestic supply chains

The UK SAF mandate includes a cap on the use of SAF made through the hydrotreated fatty acids (HEFA) pathway using feedstocks such as used cooking oil (UCO). This will begin in 2030 with the cap set at 71% of the total SAF volume in the UK versus 100% at present, declining to 35% in 2040. This is designed to incentivize the production of SAF from other pathways such as alcohol-to-jet.

“This decision has major repercussions not just for the staff at the two large UK bioethanol plants who now face a very uncertain future, but for the wider supply chains that these plants support,” RTFA said on LinkedIn on Monday May 12.

The association warned of the impact on the UK wheat industry, which supplies the Vivergo plant, calling the prouder a “major buyer” in the northeast for feed wheat, “which will have a direct impact on farmers in that region; and also produce animal feed which many livestock farmers rely on and which provides a home-grown alternative to imported soya-based feeds,” the post said.

Vivergo, which also relies on sugar for feedstock, has had patchy production over the last several years. The subsidiary at regular occasions mothballed the plant or ran it well below its 420 million liters per year capacity. Although in the third quarter of 2022 the ethanol plant was said by AB Sugar to be ramping up much closer to its nameplate capability.

“Without domestic bioethanol, all UK petrol supplied will need to be blended with a minimum of 5.5% imported bioethanol instead (to comply with the EN228 standard),” RTFA said on May 12, adding that any change in future US bioethanol availability “could then leave the UK with serious fuel security issues if our industry has already closed.”

Increased US ethanol imports post-E10 implementation

The UK saw a significant uptick in US ethanol imports after September 2021. This was when the country moved to a fuel standard of E10 (up to 10% ethanol, at least 90% petrol).

At the beginning of 2023, Crop Energies, which owns Ensus, noted that production of ethanol in 2022 had likely fallen. But demand is likely to have increased with extra consumption year on year in markets where E10 has risen. For example, in the UK, France and Sweden.

The Ensus plant is 100% reliant on corn as a feedstock. And for long stretches over the past few years has sharply reduced or suspended production because of thin or negative margins.

In 2023, Crop Energies said it would invest up to €100 million ($112 million) in the Ensus facility in a bid to enhance profitability and reduce emissions.

Growing US ethanol usage in the UK

The UK government regularly produces updates showing the volume of biofuels used in the UK to meet blend mandates. This is given alongside details of the feedstock used and the origin supplied. But the data is published in arrears, with only last year’s data currently available.

Nonetheless, the third provisional release of data for 2024 shows that 1.44 billion liters of ethanol have been accounted for under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation framework in 2024.

That figure is already 40 million liters above the full 2023 data, when 1.4 billion liters were delivered. The final 2024 data set will only be fully available in November 2025. But the volume of ethanol supplied is likely to increase when the full data is available.

Rising ethanol imports and their impact

Of the volume of ethanol supplied in 2024, the vast majority came from US-based feedstocks, typically related to corn-based ethanol. UK data shows that 701 million liters of ethanol came from the US. This was at 48.6%, just shy of half the entire supply.

The US has been a major supplier of ethanol to the UK largely since the country’s exit from the EU. This meant US ethanol imports were no longer subject to dumping duties that had been imposed on US exports into the bloc.

That came soon before the UK government increased the volume of ethanol that could be blended into the country’s petrol mix. This went from a 5% minimum, known as E5, to 10%, or E10.

But the volume of imports from the US have already picked up sharply. 2023 data shows 626 million liters supplied that year, amounting to 44.5% of the entire supply.

The Rotterdam plant, named Turbe, will initially produce 12,000 litres of e-SAF per day, with plans for a second phase to increase production tenfold to 120,000 litres per day.

Metafuels’ rapid growth is fuelled by strong investment support. In just over two years, the company has raised $22 million, including a $5 million grant from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy.

The Evos Rotterdam terminal is a dedicated multimodal methanol hub and reportedly the largest ethanol storage provider in Europe.

It offers full connectivity across vessel, barge, truck, and rail, with facilities to store renewable methanol that meets International Methanol Producers and Consumers Association (IMPCA) specifications.

Metafuels’ aerobrew technology converts sustainably produced methanol into jet fuel with high energetic efficiency and ultra-high carbon conversion.

The result is a drop-in fuel that reduces life cycle emissions by up to 90 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel, without requiring aircraft re-engineering or infrastructure changes.

The aviation sector accounts for over 2 per cent of global CO2 emissions—some 800 million tonnes.

When accounting for additional greenhouse gases and complex climate co-factors resulting from the nature and altitude of emissions, the sector’s total contribution to global warming rises to approximately 3.5 per cent.

Aerobrew SAF plants can process bio-methanol or e-methanol interchangeably, allowing the production of bio-SAF or e-SAF, or both simultaneously, in response to market signals.

Bio-methanol can be produced, for example, from biological waste, while e-SAF uses renewable electricity and captured carbon to create synthetic fuels, offering a scalable and future-proof solution for aviation decarbonisation, reported the Port of Rotterdam.

The next phase for Metafuels will be the launch of front-end engineering and design (FEED), followed by a Final Investment Decision (FID) in mid-2026.

Saurabh Kapoor, CEO of Metafuels, commented: “We have made excellent progress with our technology, and this first-of-a-kind commercial plant represents a major step forward in its commercial deployment.

“We are very excited about our cooperation with Evos as we work towards delivering the Turbe project. Europe has ambitious decarbonisation targets, but without scalable and affordable SAF production, aviation will struggle to keep up.”

Europe is expected to lead the adoption of synthetic or e-fuels, driven by strong regulatory support.

“As a company, we want to develop SAF as quickly as possible and we are working to airports to try have SAF at as many locations as we can,” said Sophie Lesnoff, Signature Aviation area director mainland Europe, during a Flight Daily News panel event at EBACE in Geneva today.

In March, private aviation terminal operator Signature announced it was adding the provision of SAF to six more locations in Europe, taking to 33 the number of locations where it offers the fuel globally.

“Of course we would like more SAF because that is the way forward and that is what we need for the environment,” she says. “However we find that it is difficult to sell. It is too expensive, it’s as simple as that. We provide it in many locations and we struggle still to sell it.”

Concerted action is needed to make SAF more affordable, she argues: “It is not something we can do [alone], but we have to work together to make it happen.”

Speaking on the same panel, C.R. Sincock II, executive vice-president AvFuels, says SAF remains the way forward, despite slower progress than hoped.

“There has been a little bit of cooling of the enthusiasm, but I don’t think it’s going anywhere. I still think it’s the long-term future.

“It is expensive. Everybody says we need more SAF, but who’s going to pay for it? At the end of the day, it’s got to come from somewhere. New technologies are always more expensive when they first start and they almost always become less expensive over time.

“So it’s going to take some time, and the industry is going to have to accept some costs that are just higher, and the cost will eventually come down. We are not quite where those ambitious targets were initially. I think it will continue to grow, and probably just take a little bit longer than we thought.”

The drive to increase SAF adoption in Europe is heightened by mandates, both in the European Union and the UK, which entered force this year. Lesnoff notes that in Europe in particular, many commercial airports are not ready for SAF.

For this reason, many in the industry are advocating for a book-and-claim system, which would decouple the physical requirement to uplift SAF at every airport from paying for it.

”I think that can work. Some parties have concerns about the legitimacy or creditability of that,” he says, but adds: ”I think done right it works perfectly well. It’s just getting the trust and understanding of it.”",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/0/3/0/110030_ebacepanel_805615.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 11:57:27.500977

The Government’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate came into effect at the start of this year, enforcing a steadily increasing amount of SAF in the overall UK aviation fuel mix. The mandate requires 2% of fuel supply in 2025 to be SAF, rising to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040. The mandate is one of few major policies currently in place designed to decarbonise aviation.

In February this year, the Government’s advisors on climate, the Climate Change Committee, published their Seventh Carbon Budget (CB7). This provides advice on emissions reductions over the five-year period 2038-2042 in the UK. Within this, SAF is projected to meet 17% of UK aviation fuel demand in 2040, less than the mandated 22%.

However, these 17% and 22% figures are based on different total fuel consumption levels (due to diverging expectations of passenger demand), meaning that the gap is larger than it first looks. The mandate modelling estimates 2.9 million tonnes of SAF in 2040, whereas CB7 projects 1.8 million tonnes, a difference of 1.1 million tonnes of SAF. In other words, the Climate Change Committee is projecting 38% less SAF supply in 2040 than the amount expected to be required by the SAF mandate. This gap in projections is significant, especially given that there are already growing concerns over sourcing of genuinely sustainable SAF despite SAF supply only being expected to make up around 230,000 tonnes this year.

There is a similar mismatch in the figures for 2030, with the mandate projecting 10% of supply to be 1,200,000 tonnes and CB7 estimating just 666,000 tonnes of SAF usage (44% less). Fuel suppliers will face significant penalties if the mandated amount is missed in any given year.",https://www.aef.org.uk/uploads/2025/05/SAF-supply-480-x-360-px.png,N,,2025-05-21 07:56:38.274880

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in aviation, one of the fastest-growing sources of emissions in many parts of the world, is a major challenge. Cross-country and international flights are especially emissions-intensive. And so far, clean substitutes for fossil jet fuel have been very expensive and limited.

Still, governments are beginning to require and incentivize the use of small amounts of sustainable fuels — generally made from plants (biofuels) and used cooking oils or manufactured using renewable energy — alongside fossil fuels. Burning these sustainable fuels in jet engines still produces carbon emissions. But those emissions are balanced by the carbon removed from the atmosphere in the process of making the fuels, either from growing the plants or manufacturing the fuels.

In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency’s Renewable Fuel Standard has worked alongside tax incentives and state programs to encourage the construction of production capacity over the past few years. Several of those facilities began kicking into gear late last year and early this year. The two lines in the chart above show that SAF production is suddenly shooting up as new capacity finally comes online.

It is unclear whether some of the policies that have led to SAF’s growth so far will survive efforts by Republicans in Washington to roll back policies that support renewable energy and climate action.

U.S. SAF production capacity increased by 25,000 barrels per day at the end of 2024, from near zero, as facilities in California and Texas came online, according to EIA’s analysis of company announcements and trade press. Production capacity jumped to 30,000 barrels per day by February 2025.

Overall production of “other biofuels,” EIA’s category that includes SAF but excludes the more established biofuels ethanol, biodiesel and renewable biodiesel, is expected to double in 2025 compared to last year, then rise another 20% next year, driven in large part by growing SAF production, the EIA said.

Still, those volumes represent less than 2% of the 1.7 million barrels of jet fuel used in the U.S. each day. Because the aviation sector overall is continuing to grow, the share of sustainable fuels in the overall fuel mix will remain about the same next year even after the additional production growth.",https://www.ciphernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cipher_Data_Dive_US_SAF_Production_5_20_2025_v2.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 07:56:42.787736

SAF blending mandates have therefore been proposed in Europe, the UK, and discussed in other regions globally. But these mandates are controversial. Arguments in favor, and arguments against, are presented on pages 3-5.

We have looked at many SAF pathways in the past, from bio-GTL, to e-fuels, to corn ethanol or sugar ethanol via bio-ethylene to kerosene.

Producing SAF with Neste Neste has significantly expanded its SAF production capabilities in 2025.","Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net zero CO₂ emissions by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association.

Two companies leading the way in sustainable SAF are Neste, the world’s leading producer of SAF and renewable diesel, and FedEx, the world’s largest express cargo airline.

The two global leaders have agreed to supply 8,800 tonnes of blended SAF to FedEx at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) – the largest SAF purchase by a US cargo line at LAX to date.

Collaborating for SAF

Through this agreement the blended fuel from Neste will include a minimum of 30% neat Neste ‘MY SAF’.

Neat SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel before use and is considered a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it works within existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure without any equipment updates.

In its blended form, the fuel will account for roughly a fifth of all jet fuel consumed annually by FedEx at LAX, based on FY25 fuel use forecasts.

“As the world’s preeminent express transportation company, our initial US deployment of this fuel advances our sustainability goals and bolsters the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF,” says Richard Smith, Chief Operating Officer, International, and Chief Executive Officer, Airline, FedEx.

“While we know further growth of the SAF market is needed, alongside other innovations, we are proud to celebrate this milestone with our world-class air network.”

Neste ‘MY SAF’ reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% (when used in neat form) across the fuel’s life cycle, compared to using conventional jet fuel.

Neste SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste.

FedEx’s SAF journey

The SAF purchase by FedEx builds upon years of the company’s efforts to co-create innovative, sustainable aviation technology by collaborating with other industry leaders.

As well as Neste, FedEx has collaborated with the ecoDemonstrator flight-test programme with Boeing – the world’s first commercial airplane flight using 100% SAF in both engines (2018).

As well as the procurement of SAF, FedEx is pursuing multiple ways to improve efficiency and reduce fuel consumption in its aviation operations overall, including aircraft fleet modernisation, fuel conservation initiatives and flight planning optimisation.

“Procuring SAF is an important component of our aviation emissions-reduction strategy in the coming years, and we are pleased to have executed a deal with Neste to begin using this fuel in our air operations,” comments Karen Blanks Ellis, Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President of Environmental Affairs, FedEx.

“Our aviation network represents the largest amount of FedEx fuel use globally and, as a result, is our biggest opportunity to drive down emissions. As we work toward our goal of carbon-neural operations by 2040, we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.”

Collectively, fleet modernisation and fuel saving efforts enabled FedEx in fiscal year 2024 to successfully achieve its goal of a 30% reduction in aviation emissions intensity from a 2005 baseline.

FedEx set its first aviation emissions intensity reduction goals back in 2008.

Producing SAF with Neste

Neste has significantly expanded its SAF production capabilities in 2025.

The company has begun producing SAF at its renewable products refinery in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, following major upgrades that enable the site to produce up to 500,000 tons annually.

This renewable development brings Neste’s total global SAF production capacity to 1.5 million tons per year, or approximately 1.875 billion litres.

“Neste is excited to work with FedEx and support their ambitious goal of reaching carbon-neutral operations by 2040 with our SAF,” says Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste.

“Recognising the important role of air cargo in the global economy, FedEx is demonstrating how this industry can leverage available lower-emission solutions like SAF to reduce its environmental impact. We look forward to further strengthening our cooperation.”

As well as Rotterdam, Neste operates SAF production facilities in Singapore and Porvoo, Finland, reinforcing its global supply network.

To create a stable future, Neste is investing in further expansion, aiming to more than double the Rotterdam refinery’s capacity.

By 2027, the site is expected to produce 2.7 million tons of renewable products annually, making it the world’s largest facility for renewable diesel and SAF, increasing Neste’s overall renewable fuels capacity to 6.8 million tons per year, with SAF representing 2.2 million tons.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/efee9015a32d2d6048c016313078ca6b:508122d8e7d4cdb0e7694546b6aae030/neste-saf.png.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 06:56:07.236203

Mr. Joseph Bukari Nikpe, Minister of Transport, said aviation was a major contributor to global carbon emissions, posing threats to the environment, economy, and future generations.

ICAO estimates that aviation contributes two to three per cent of global carbon emissions.

Mr. Nikpe stressed the need for proactive measures to transition towards cleaner, sustainable fuels.

“SAF has the potential to reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel,” he said.

“It can power today’s aircraft engines without modification, making it an immediate and viable solution for greener air travel,” Mr. Nikpe added.

He called on the private sector to actively participate in the SAF project.

Mr. Cesar Velarde, ICAO ACT-SAF Project Coordinator, described SAF as both an environmental and socio-economic opportunity for Ghana.

For the next two days, industry stakeholders and government officials will meet to identify challenges affecting SAF production.

He also pledged ICAO’s assistance in helping Ghana realise its SAF goals.

“This workshop is just the kick-off of a six-month assistance project that will consist of a first feasibility study for SAF,” he said.

Mr. John Dumelo, Deputy Minister of Food and Agriculture, lauded the initiative, noting that SAF development would create new value chains in agriculture, stimulating demand for energy crops and agricultural residues.

To achieve Canada’s net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the adoption of low-carbon drop-in biofuels is critical to decarbonizing the hard-to-electrify transportation modes such as aviation, marine, long-distance trucking, and rail. This project will address the technical barriers to producing drop-in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel from various biomass-derived intermediates.

Bio-intermediates investigated include not only biocrudes derived from low-cost lignocellulosic biomass (forest residues and agricultural wastes), microalgae, and sludges from wastewater treatment but also different lignin-derived materials. These bio-intermediates cannot be used directly as drop-in biofuels for transportation due to their properties incompatible with petroleum-derived fuels.

Impact and Innovation

The technical challenges addressed involve eliminating impurities and oxygen in bio-intermediates, modifying the chemical profile of biofuel products, meeting fuel standards, and improving product yields thus reducing their carbon intensity and cost. The optimal upgrading approaches for different bio-intermediates will be identified by performing experimental evaluation, and product properties will be assessed against the SAF and renewable diesel specifications to determine promising pathways.

The refinery has been modified to enable Neste to produce up to 500,000t of SAF annually, increasing the company’s global SAF production capability to 1.5 million tons per annum.
“In the business aviation sector, we’ve seen a lot of operators who really like to use SAF.
“Today we are one of the largest single-site SAF suppliers to the business aviation community,” says Farnborough Airport chief executive Simon Geere.
Despite supply challenges, Geere sees SAF as an opportunity for business aviation.","In 2019 when more than a dozen business jets touched down at EBACE in Geneva fuelled by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), it seemed to herald a new dawn as a sector under a lot of pressure for its impact on the environment looked to fulfil a pledge to clean up its act.

Six years on and most of the challenges flagged at the time around embracing SAF – notably relating to cost, availability and a lack of sufficient policy support – remain issues.

And for those flying within, to or from Europe, they now face the additional impetus of meeting mandates around the uplift of SAF.

Under mandates in the European Union and the UK respectively, from this year 2% of all fuel uplifted at European and UK airports must be SAF. Both schemes progressively ramp up the share of SAF required, initially to 6% in the EU and 10% in the UK by 2030, and then steeply upwards towards 2050.

Both mandates also include requirements for a portion of this SAF to be synthetic or power-to-liquid fuels, starting in the UK from 2028 and from 2030 in the EU. It is the eSAF component which is raising most concerns given the dearth of production of non HEFA-based (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) SAF today.

That was underlined by European aviation regulator EASA in an update on progress to meeting SAF mandate targets. EASA’s production capacity assessment for the EU judged that announced SAF capacity is expected to meet the minimum SAF share required by 2030.

However, it flagged that “rapid action” is needed to meet the synthetic aviation fuel minimum share requirements, noting final investment decisions are required on synthetic fuel facilities in the next couple of years to hit the 2030 target.

But new SAF facilities have come on track. In April, green fuels specialist Neste began producing SAF at its renewable-products refinery in Rotterdam. The refinery has been modified to enable Neste to produce up to 500,000t of SAF annually, increasing the company’s global SAF production capability to 1.5 million tons per annum.

“Line number one is complete, and we are now ready to supply EU-based production of SAF for our customers out of Rotterdam,” said Neste chief executive Heikki Malinen during a first-quarter results call. “Then the big thing at Neste is the new huge investment in Rotterdam to build a second line.”

However, other developments are lagging. Shell for example last summer paused construction work at its 820,000t a year biofuels facility in Rotterdam “to address project delivery and ensure future competitiveness given current market conditions”. Meanwhile, in April, BP was reported to have paused plans to produce SAF at is Castellon refinery in Spain.

While BP is re-emphasising growth of its oil and gas business under a strategic reset since new chief executive Murray Auchincloss took the helm, Air BP chief executive and senior vice-president, global aviation for BP, Fede Berra, says this strategy will still enable it to invest in its low-carbon businesses.

“There is enough supply for current [SAF] mandates but looking forward we are making a commitment to biofuels and buying in the market to supply our customers,” she says, noting that it is working on three HEFA SAF projects. A final investment decision to progress one is due in 2027.

“Supply is enough for medium-term needs but from the 2030s we will need more production coming on line and alternative feedstocks. There is only so much cooking oil in the world,” she says, noting Air BP is evaluating clover crops which offer the same or reduced carbon intensity as cooking oils with limited impact on land use if planted between food crops.

Berra though highlights concern around there being enough eSAF production in place to meet that part of the mandates as “the current risk versus reward is not balanced”. She adds: “Another challenge is that the price of eSAF will be five to eight times that of jet fuel.”

Meanwhile, BP has just successfully led a taskforce to achieve approval from the UK Ministry of Defence for co-processing SAF with up to 30% renewable HEFA, up from the current limit of 5%. “Co-processing produces high-quality fuel that meets stringent aviation standards, while helping to increase the volume of SAF available to customers,” says Berra.

Daniel Coetzer, chief executive of the international business of US-based Titan Aviation Fuels, points to the expectations placed on oil companies to lead the renewable transition, without clarity on the details of how the SAF can be sustainably produced.

“I think for the past few years there has been quite a lot of unfair pressure on oil companies to come up with the solution and I think now people start to realise that it is not that easy,” he says. “It is going to come, but let’s find a logical solution.”

Coetzer notes that the scale of commitments means airlines will be first in the queue when it comes to securing SAF, rather than the smaller passenger numbers the cost of SAF must be spread across for business aviation.

“In the business aviation sector, we’ve seen a lot of operators who really like to use SAF. But it’s just very expensive,” he says.

“We have the product available from our suppliers,” Coetzer adds. “We are really trying to market it and assist our customers; both to enable the ones who want the product to have it, and the ones who don’t have the product or don’t understand the product’s viability yet, to work with them to explain it is a good product, it is viable.”

But he notes that even business aviation operators that are outside the mandate’s scope – operating fewer than 500 flights a year – can end up paying for SAF if they fuel from an airport that is providing a SAF blend because it is already mixed in the fuel.

He says Titan is working with out-of-scope operators to find airports that can provide regular Jet-A fuel but adds: “I think there must be something in place so if you are charged and you are not meant to be charged, that you are exempt from it. There must be a way you can claim this back from the EU, but that is not there yet.”

In February the European Business Aviation Association (EBAA) joined a host of other European aviation bodies to press the case for the adoption of a book-and-claim system to help accelerate the deployment of SAF across Europe.

A book-and-claim system – a mechanism under which SAF purchases and usages could be accounted for without requiring physical delivery at an airport – would, they say, ensure a more efficient SAF market without being restricted to physical supply at mandated airports, while also helping aircraft operators to comply with the mandates without incurring additional costs.

“This system can be introduced without any additional cost to the EU or the member states, while it would enable better distribution of and access to SAF at competitive prices, which in

turn would help to stimulate and deploy production across Europe,” the industry bodies said in a February letter to the European Commission.

EBAA has long been calling for a book-and-claim system, flagging it as a crucial requirement in early 2024 when, together with the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), it set out recommendations for the sector to exceed mandated requirements of uplifted SAF.

That sought to create a framework to support European business aircraft operators to reach 20% SAF uptake levels – either directly uplifted or through a ‘robust’ book-and-claim systemby 2030 – and ultimately to be using 100% SAF by 2050.

The associations identified a number of European airports it was working with to facilitate rovision of SAF. One of those, Farnborough Airport in the UK, is seeking to establish a leadership position – having sold more than two million litres of SAF since making it available for all customers in July 2021.

“Today we are one of the largest single-site SAF suppliers to the business aviation community,” says Farnborough Airport chief executive Simon Geere. “We have ambitions to be the first UK airport to transition away from traditional jet fuel entirely and to do so by the end of the decade.”

It took a further step towards that aspiration in March when it struck a deal with Hydrogen Refinery for 12.5 million litres, or 10,000t, per annum of SAF produced locally from waste.

“It has the potential to provide us with enough proprietary supplies of SAF for us to become the first and only airport in the world to be offering fuel with a 20% blend across its entire supply by 2028,” says Geere.

Despite supply challenges, Geere sees SAF as an opportunity for business aviation. “This is because typically it is a market which has the capability to sustain the higher upfront costs necessary to support the transition to new fuel technologies,” he says. “We see ourselves at the forefront of this opportunity to advance the technology due to the significant economic value of the flights we support and the smaller and modern aircraft we handle.”

Elsewhere, Patrick Gallagher, president of fractional aircraft ownership giant NetJets, flagged its continued investment in sustainable fuel. “We roughly doubled the amount of SAF we purchased in 2024 compared to the prior year and nobody in the industry buys more SAF than we do,” he said in a social media post earlier this year.

Other recent developments include Jet Aviation, which has provided SAF in Geneva at recent EBACE shows, in January offering SAF at its completions and maintenance facility in Basel – the firm’s 12th location for such a service.

Meanwhile, in March, private aviation terminals operator Signature Aviation announced it was adding the provision of SAF to six more locations in Europe: the London airports of Gatwick, Heathrow and Luton, as well as East Midlands and Manchester airports in the UK and Paris Le Bourget. It takes to 33 the number of locations where Signature is offering SAF.

It also has plans to add SAF provision to further fixed-base operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa this year, as well as unveiling its first fully electric refueling vehicle in the region at Nice Cote d’Azur airport.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/0/2/3/110023_farnboroughairport_885271.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 04:56:54.297064

Presented in Parliament, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill outlines a framework to implement a revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) that will guarantee a set price for eligible SAF sold over a fixed period.

This initiative is designed to reduce financial risks for producers and unlock investment in the UK’s first commercial-scale SAF facilities.

Under the proposed legislation, a government-appointed entity will be authorised to enter into private contracts with SAF producers.

The Bill also allows for the creation of a levy on aviation fuel suppliers operating in the UK to fund the scheme’s payment commitments and administration costs.

While SAF suppliers are already required to meet increasing targets under a mandate that began in January, the RCM is seen as a crucial step in encouraging final investment decisions by providing long-term price stability.

In addition, the government has announced an extra £400,000 (€475,000) in funding to support the testing and qualification of SAF technologies.

“This legislation supports our SAF mandate, which requires at least 10% of jet fuel used on UK-departing flights to come from sustainable sources by 2030, increasing to 22% by 2040,” said the Department for Transport (DfT).

“The financial mechanism is a clear signal of our commitment to fostering a thriving domestic SAF industry. It provides the certainty and confidence producers need to invest in clean energy.”

According to the government, three major barriers currently hinder SAF projects from reaching final investment decisions in the UK - the absence of a transparent market price for advanced non-HEFA SAF, regulatory uncertainty, and stiff competition for investment from other emerging low-carbon technologies both domestically and abroad.

To address these issues, the RCM will operate using a guaranteed strike price model—similar to the UK’s Contracts for Difference scheme used in the renewable electricity sector.

The first round of contracts will focus on SAF projects utilising non-HEFA technologies and feedstocks.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/UK-introduces-pic-Biofuel-21-5-665657-768x512.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 04:57:06.586313

""Through this agreement, FedEx has purchased blended fuel from Neste that includes a minimum of 30% neat, i.e. unblended Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Delivery of the fuel began in May 2025 and will continue for one year,"" the statement said.

Neste will supply more than 3 million gallons or 8,800 mt of blended SAF to FedEx at the Los Angeles airport, which will account for about one-fifth of FedEx's Los Angeles jet fuel consumption annually.

Neste's SAF is made from 100% renewable waste, including used cooking oil and animal waste fat, and can be blended with up to 50% of conventional jet fuel.

Neste already supplies other Los Angeles carriers with SAF. Earlier in May, Air New Zealand signed its biggest SAF offtake deal with Neste for 30 million liters of SAF to be delivered to Los Angeles and San Francisco airports through February 2026.

SAF production supported as Martinez's work is completed

Currently, Neste's global SAF production capability is 515 million gallons, or around 1.5 million mt annually. Neste produces SAF at its Rotterdam and Singapore facilities as well as in California, where Neste and Marathon Petroleum are 50:50 joint venture partners in Martinez Renewables.

The facility, converted from a petroleum refinery, is located in the San Francisco Bay Area and can produce about 730 million gal/year of renewable diesel and SAF.

The facility reached full capacity at the end of 2024 when the pre-treatment unit was up and running, which allows it to optimize advantaged feedstock, improving the carbon intensity score and increasing its value.

Marathon's renewable diesel segment, which also includes the Dickinson, North Dakota, facility ran at 70% utilization in the first quarter, due in part to down time at the Martinez facility, Marathon said on its May 6 Q1 results call.

The Martinez pre-treatment unit came online in Q4 2024, allowing the partners to optimize feedstocks and benefit from California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard credits, which reward lower carbon fuel intensity.

So far in the second quarter, California's LCFS credits are averaging $57.97/mt, down from Q1's average of $66.80/mt. The LCFS is undergoing a significant change aimed at reducing carbon reduction targets and increasing the falling value of the credits, which have been declining.

The LCFS remains under review after amendments were not approved by the Office of Administrative Law on Feb. 18, 2025, giving the California Air Resources Board 120 days to amend them.

The price of SAF in California has averaged $6.74/gal so far in Q2, down from the $6.98/gal average in Q1, according to assessments from Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-21 01:56:08.178119

“Projected obligations should accurately reflect the availability of feedstocks and ongoing investments in production capacity,” the lawmakers wrote. “Now more than ever, it is essential to identify and promote opportunities, like the upcoming RVOs, that lower costs for consumers and support economic growth.

“Even before you took office, the EPA was months behind meeting the statutory deadline to set RVOs, which only exacerbated market instability,” they continued. “Domestic biofuel production facilities have already idled, and further delays in action could result in additional closures, putting Americans out of work and disrupting key markets for farmers.”

Within the letter, the House members note that strong RFS RVOs will lower prices at the pump while creating and maintaining U.S. biomanufacturing jobs and driving economic growth. “A strong RVO will also support market growth for farmers at a time when global markets are experiencing uncertainty. The domestic biofuels industry stands ready to increase availability of affordable fuels options and support the administration’s goal of American energy dominance,” the added.

The lawmakers ask Trump to ensure the implied RVO for conventional biofuel is set at least 15 billion gallons. The RVO for biomass-based diesel should be set at 5.25 billion gallons in 2026, increasing to higher levels in future years to reflect the rapid growth of renewable diesel and soybean processing capacity. In addition, the House members are urging Trump to reject any abuse of small refinery exemption (SRE) authority and ensure any legitimate SREs have their volumes accounted for in the RVOs to prevent lost demand in key markets for farmers.

What is wind tunnel testing?
Wind tunnel testing is crucial for validating digital simulation and modelling.","New propulsion systems including the open fan could further increase the fuel efficiency of a next generation aircraft. Airbus and engine partner CFM International are testing an open fan demonstrator, part of CFM’s RISE program, to explore its aerodynamic profile, acoustic footprint and ease of integration.

Next-generation aircraft propulsion systems play a big part in the aviation industry’s net-zero ambition by 2050.The open fan engine architecture is one such promising technology. It combines the fuel economy of a turboprop with the performance and speed of a turbofan. Ahead of real-world flight testing, Airbus and engine partner CFM are running wind tunnel tests on an open fan demonstrator to examine its aerodynamic and acoustic performance.

Compatible with alternative energy sources

Designing a future Airbus aircraft starts with reducing its fuel consumption. Improved aerodynamics make a big contribution, but the propulsion system can make a significant difference too. The open fan’s aerodynamic profile, acoustic footprint and ease of integration will all be decisive when it becomes time to choose between this technology and its rival, the ultra-high bypass turbo fan.

To that end, for the last three years Airbus partner CFM (a joint venture between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines) has been developing an open fan demonstrator through its RISE technology demonstration program, or Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines.

The RISE program’s goals include reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by more than 20% compared to today’s most efficient engines, as well as testing compatibility with alternative energy sources including sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and hydrogen. The programme is supported by funding from the European Clean Aviation framework, the French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC), and CORAC, the French Civil Aviation Council.

Wind tunnel tests provide highly accurate data

Airbus has partnered with CFM to evaluate open fan’s potential for use on a future aircraft. Before flight testing can begin, the open fan architecture and its integration onto the aircraft are subjected to wind tunnel testing. This test phase deploys two ‘minimum body models’: a 1:5.5 scale model for high-speed testing and a 1:7 model for low-speed testing.

Each model is tested both alone and with a scale-model wing to evaluate how the two interact. For the low-speed model, testing is extended to high-lift devices such as flaps and slats. The tests are held at wind tunnels belonging to French aerospace lab ONERA (high speed) and DNW, a Dutch-German facility located in the Netherlands (low speed). Both produce highly accurate data.

The high-speed tests were run at ONERA in early 2024. They gathered experimental data, enabling researchers to study the models’ installation effects and propeller performance. Then tests replicating take-off and landing were conducted at DNW from September to late November 2024. They focused on the open fan’s aero-acoustic performance and interaction with high-lift devices.

As open fan engines are unducted (they dispense with the cowling of conventional jet engines), addressing the noise of their larger rotor blades requires innovative design choices and new technologies at engine and aircraft level. Nonetheless the engines must still conform to acoustic regulatory and certification requirements.

Towards flight testing

After over 500 hours of testing, this ‘minimum body’ campaign – just the first – is coming to an end. The next step is to assess how an open fan propulsion system affects aircraft performance, using 1:11 (high speed) and 1:14 (low speed) full aircraft models. These models will be tested at ONERA’s high-speed wind tunnel and Airbus’ low-speed facility in Filton, UK, in 2026. Their design and production is already in progress.

Open fan testing will meet full-scale reality by the end of the decade, when a fully functioning engine will be fitted to an A380 flight test aircraft operating out of Toulouse, France. The process of modifying the aircraft to host the engine has already begun.

What is wind tunnel testing?

Wind tunnel testing is crucial for validating digital simulation and modelling. By blowing air over scale models, engineers observe and measure the forces of lift and drag, as well as stability and control.

This helps them to identify potential design flaws and optimise the aircraft's shape for better performance and fuel efficiency, before a full-size, expensive prototype is built. Wind tunnels simulate various flight conditions, helping to ensure the aircraft can handle different speeds, altitudes, and even challenging weather, ultimately leading to safer skies.",https://mediaassets.airbus.com/medias/domain38/media102359/707893-bs2jiejxye-preview.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 17:56:08.373589

generate economic growth for the region

PECOS, Texas, May 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Infinium, the world’s leading producer of commercially available eFuels, announced today that construction is underway on its second U.S.-based eFuels production site, known as Project Roadrunner. The project, which includes investors Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, is located in Reeves County, Texas, near the city of Pecos.

The site is expected to become the world’s largest eFuels production facility when operational, producing 23,000 tonnes per year (7.6 million gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other eFuel products for customers including global aviation leaders American Airlines and IAG, owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and other international airline brands.

Infinium CEO Robert Schuetzle, said:

Infinium’s Project Roadrunner marks a huge achievement for the fuel industry,

“Not only will the project produce commercial eSAF for its customers, it will bring highly skilled jobs and economic growth to the Pecos community and state of Texas. This project demonstrates the ongoing commitment of Infinium, its investors, and partners to help ensure that the United States remains a global leader in energy security, resilience and innovation.”

eFuels are synthetic fuels, produced from waste CO2 and renewable energy, that are chemically identical to conventional petroleum-based fuels. These drop-in fuels are used in the transportation and chemicals sectors, seamlessly integrating with existing engines, infrastructure, and manufacturing processes. Infinium eFuels provide an opportunity for energy diversification while leveraging the global infrastructure that powers the transportation and chemicals industries today. In 2023, Infinium became the world’s first to produce and ship commercial volumes of eFuels to customers in the U.S. and Europe from its production facility, Project Pathfinder, in Corpus Christi, Texas.

The Roadrunner project reached financial close with investments from Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and is now under construction. The project represents significant investment in the region and will support highly skilled direct labor jobs in construction, fabrication, operations, and logistics locally and across Texas. Commercial agreements for the project—including feedstock, vendor and offtake contracts — have been structured and de-risked to attract the infrastructure capital and debt required for the continued scaling of the eFuels market.

Infinium’s Project Roadrunner facility will convert waste CO2 and renewable energy to produce sustainable aviation fuel, leveraging new renewable power assets purpose-built for the project. The fuels produced by the Roadrunner project will be sold domestically in the U.S. and exported to international markets. Under a landmark agreement with airline group IAG, the eSAF will be shipped to the UK to satisfy compliance requirements under the recently enacted UK SAF Mandate which requires that at least 10% of all jet fuel in flights taking off from the UK is sourced from sustainable feedstocks by 2030.

Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s Group Sustainability Officer, said:

The construction of Project Roadrunner represents a real step forward in the production of sustainable aviation fuel at scale,

“We’re proud to be an early customer of Infinium’s eSAF and working hard to procure and invest in SAF to deliver our 10% 2030 SAF goal. The aviation industry is making progress, but continued support and stronger incentives are necessary to accelerate production at the scale and pace required to ensure a long-term, affordable supply.”

Currently under construction, the facility is expected to reach commercial operations in 2027. Roadrunner has secured 150 MW of new wind generation capacity from a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources through a long-term power purchase agreement.

Petter Skantze, Senior Vice President, Infrastructure Development for NextEra Energy Resources, said:

We are pleased to support Infinium’s Roadrunner project, which reflects a significant step forward for an emerging new market for renewable electricity,

“The United States has tremendous potential to use its abundant energy resources to serve global demand, and we’re excited to expand our investment in Texas to enable Infinium’s industry-leading electro-fuels production facility.”

Infinium selected leading electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen to supply its complete 100 megawatt (MW) HYPRPlant solution for the project, which will be integrated on site for green hydrogen production1. This large-scale system will not only produce hydrogen for the eSAF facility but will also have capacity to support future hydrogen offtake opportunities.

Mario Fernandez, Head of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, said:

Infinium’s Project Roadrunner stands as a remarkable example of how next-generation technologies can rapidly evolve from proof-of-concept to finance-ready infrastructure,

“At BE Catalyst, we are proud to have partnered with Infinium from the onset to help shape this project, positioning it to attract the necessary infrastructure capital required to scale and accelerate the delivery of eFuels into the market.”

Laura Hellman, Senior Vice President at Brookfield, said:

Our investments in Infinium and Project Roadrunner are the first Brookfield has committed to sustainable aviation fuel,

“We are excited about our partnership with Infinium which will help advance sustainability within the aviation sector consistent with the goals of our investment strategy.”

The Roadrunner project underscores expanded support for innovative solutions that meet the market’s growing demand for resilient energy supply chains, while decarbonizing and utilizing products that leverage the existing infrastructure and engines in use today. By enabling eFuels to be used as pure fuel or blended with petroleum-based products, Infinium solutions can be used to significantly reduce the overall carbon footprint of the energy supply chain. Supported by top industry leaders in energy and infrastructure, Infinium is expanding its development of eFuel facilities both across the U.S. and internationally. This growth will not only contribute to the expansion and diversification of fuel market supply options but also offer low-carbon alternatives to augment conventional fuels relied on today.

Supersonic flight over land remains banned in the United States.
Because these routes are nearly 100 percent over water, they avoid the legal issues tied to mainland supersonic travel.
The future of Hawaii travel may be faster, more expensive, and more divisive than ever.
Environmental groups and noise critics remain vocal, and some lawmakers have been reluctant to support supersonic travel even under the promise of new technology.","Imagine flying from LAX to Hawaii in just three hours. That’s the promise Boom Supersonic keeps dangling. With live engine tests underway on the Overture, the dream moved closer to the runway. But not everyone’s buying it.

Skeptics say it’s a billionaire fantasy. The plane hasn’t flown, and the engine isn’t certified. FAA approvals could take years—if they happen at all. Even longtime backers are raising eyebrows, with the company’s CEO calling for the TSA to be abolished.

Still, there’s momentum. Boom is betting on new air travel: faster, greener, smaller, and more exclusive. And Hawaii may become more central to that vision than anyone expected.

Why Hawaii could be first.

Boom’s route maps have mostly emphasized transatlantic flights. But when considering where the Overture can legally operate at supersonic speeds—over water, not land—Hawaii suddenly becomes one of the most realistic early markets.

Flights between the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii meet several strategic needs: long stretches over the ocean, demand from premium leisure travelers, no speed limitation, and no overland restrictions like those that apply to domestic routes.

Supersonic flight over land remains banned in the United States. Until or unless that changes, Boom needs oceanic corridors—and the Pacific is wide open. That makes Hawaii a uniquely viable option, even if it isn’t the company’s original target.

Engine testing moves the vision forward.

Boom’s new Colorado Air and Space Port test site is upgrading to support the current engine development phase. These are no longer simulations. The company is now running live trials with real hardware, including core components of the Symphony engine.

Symphony will run exclusively on sustainable aviation fuel, which Boom says is essential to its long-term strategy. That detail could play especially well in Hawaii, where tourism officials have doubled down on green messaging, cultural responsibility, and environmental protections.

While engineers were firing up the engine, Boom’s CEO stirred a different reaction. In a recent interview, Blake Scholl said, “We don’t need the TSA.” His comment was part of a broader critique of airport security and a call for private solutions to serve high-speed, premium travelers better.

The backlash was immediate. Some travelers said they welcomed the idea of streamlined screening. Others called the remark reckless, especially from a startup still working through the FAA’s regulatory pipeline. In Hawaii, where airports like HNL and KOA already struggle with crowding, Scholl’s comment tapped into real frustrations. But for Boom, the timing may have added unnecessary political baggage.

Hawaii keeps coming up in discussions.

Boom says its first commercial flights could launch as early as 2029. United and American Airlines have placed orders, but no routes to Hawaii have been formally announced.

Even so, Hawaii keeps appearing in Boom’s ecosystem. It’s shown up in earlier marketing maps, investor briefings focused on overwater corridors, and performance metrics that match West Coast–Hawaii distances almost perfectly.

A flight from Los Angeles to Honolulu could take around three hours. San Francisco to Maui would be only slightly longer. Because these routes are nearly 100 percent over water, they avoid the legal issues tied to mainland supersonic travel.

A changing Hawaii air market.

The Hawaii travel landscape could look very different when Boom’s jet is certified and ready to fly. Hawaiian Airlines is in the process of being absorbed into Alaska. Southwest is pulling back on several routes. Widebody service is shrinking. Long-haul comfort is being redefined.

This opens up a potential lane for Boom. If Alaska continues exploring widebody flying and long-distance markets—something it’s already doing with Europe—then Hawaii could become part of a premium strategy later on. With fewer seats and higher fares, Boom’s aircraft could be a natural fit for routes that need yield, not volume.

What readers have said.

Our earlier Boom coverage brought in a broad mix of reader perspectives. One traveler, Chris, told us he’d gladly pay double if it meant reaching Maui in three hours, adding that the flight was always the worst part of the trip. Another, Maya, said she doubted this would ever become a real option for average travelers and saw it as something designed for CEOs and influencers.

This story resonates because of the tension between hopeful innovation and real-world skepticism. The future of Hawaii travel may be faster, more expensive, and more divisive than ever.

Hawaii’s environmental edge.

Symphony is designed to run exclusively on sustainable aviation fuel, and Boom has pledged to meet net-zero carbon targets. That emphasis could play well in Hawaii, where eco-conscious travel is becoming part of the state’s identity.

Hawaii is actively reshaping its marketing between green fees, restricted access to natural sites, and visitor education efforts. If Boom is looking for destinations that align with its sustainability messaging, the islands check several boxes.

What could still go wrong?

Boom’s progress is real, but the challenges remain substantial. The Overture jet hasn’t flown. The Symphony engine isn’t certified. FAA approvals for supersonic commercial service are still multiple years away. Public sentiment is mixed, and the overland flight ban is still in place, with no clear timeline for reversal.

Environmental groups and noise critics remain vocal, and some lawmakers have been reluctant to support supersonic travel even under the promise of new technology. While Boom’s approach is very different from the Concorde era, the path forward is anything but smooth.

Would you fly Boom to Hawaii?

Would you pay more to cut your Hawaii flight time in half? Or are you waiting to see if this is just another airline fantasy?",https://beatofhawaii.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1000000673.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 16:56:56.489576

“We understand that the ReFuelEU mandate is aiming to help the environment, which is important, but it is not a one-size-fits-all regulation,” said Daniel Coetzer, CEO of Titan Aviation International.
We aim to help them ensure compliance, simplify the SAF uplift process, and enhance budget management.” The mandate has changed the fueling landscape, Coetzer said.
Titan is working to identify the airports that can provide the SAF and those that can provide regular Jet-A fuel.
“It puts out-of-scope operators at a financial disadvantage to have to pay for SAF uplift when they don’t need to,” Coetzer said.","GENEVA—Titan Aviation Fuels International has launched a program to help business aviation operators comply with Europe’s complex ReFuelEU mandate.

The mandate, introduced January 2025, requires operators who fly more than 500 flights a year to uplift a 2% blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at airports designated under the requirement.

Titan, based in Geneva, Switzerland, is providing information about the mandate, monitoring which airports must comply with the 2% SAF requirement, advising operators when they need to be compliant then helping them show their compliance by breaking out the cost of SAF on their invoices, it says. Operators can also use it as a marketing tool to show their commitment to carbon reduction.

The mandate impacts more than 60 airports in the European Union.

“We understand that the ReFuelEU mandate is aiming to help the environment, which is important, but it is not a one-size-fits-all regulation,” said Daniel Coetzer, CEO of Titan Aviation International.

Instead, “it’s a complicated issue,” Coetzer tells Aviation Week Network.

SAF remains in short supply. That means some of the airports do not have the SAF blend available, although in those cases operators still pay for the 2% blend but don’t receive it.

“I think there was never made a provision for the probability when there is no SAF available at the airport,” Coetzer says. “Provision was supposed to be made that it can be exempted ... so they’re still paying the fee for right now.”

On the other hand, some airports with the 2% SAF mix available may have only offered that option, which means even operators who do not fall under the ReFuelEU mandate must pay for it.

“Our customers include operators obliged to comply with the mandate, operators that don’t need to uplift the 2% SAF but who don’t have a choice in doing so at many airports, and operators that would like to uplift a higher blend of SAF but cannot find it as the supply isn’t there,” Coetzer says. “We’re pleased to be providing our clients with comprehensive advice in such a complicated operating environment. We aim to help them ensure compliance, simplify the SAF uplift process, and enhance budget management.”

The mandate has changed the fueling landscape, Coetzer said.

Titan is working to identify the airports that can provide the SAF and those that can provide regular Jet-A fuel.

“It puts out-of-scope operators at a financial disadvantage to have to pay for SAF uplift when they don’t need to,” Coetzer said. “We are noting changes in European flight paths, as these operators fly to a different airport to avoid incurring extra fees. Of course, we want to make sure our customers are complying with the mandate where they must, but equally, we want to make sure our customers have alternative options when they don’t need to comply, particularly as there is no version of a claim-back service as yet.”",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-05-20 15:56:24.933203

Ellis Shelton, Logistics UK's Senior Policy Advisor said: ""Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as a drop in fuel, is a vital alternative to traditional kerosene jet fuel, reducing aviation lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%.
This has the potential to benefit local economies, particularly in rural areas where biomass feedstocks are sourced, and in industrial regions where new SAF production facilities are established.
Implementing a SAF revenue certainty mechanism is crucial to reducing financial risks and attracting investment.
A revenue certainty mechanism should be delivered earlier than Q4 2026, given the SAF mandate will be introduced from 2025.","The government also announced an additional £400,000 of funding for producers. These measures sit alongside the requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year, which specifies that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030 should be made with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

The government also published its response to its consultation on how the SAF revenue certainty mechanism will be funded on 14 May. The response details that government will proceed with the variable levy on aviation fuel suppliers, relative to their market share of fossil-based aviation turbine fuels.

Logistics UK responded to the consultation, welcoming a revenue certainty mechanism to help de-risk investment in production.

Ellis Shelton, Logistics UK's Senior Policy Advisor said: ""Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as a drop in fuel, is a vital alternative to traditional kerosene jet fuel, reducing aviation lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%. With no zero-emission alternative currently viable for long haul flight, SAF is the most significant opportunity to reduce aviation emissions in the medium term.

""SAF reduces carbon emissions but also lowers other harmful pollutants, such as particulate matter and sulphur oxides, contributing to better air quality around airports and reducing the aviation sector’s overall environmental impact.

""By integrating SAF into the fuel supply chain, and adopting higher SAF blends, the aviation industry can make significant progress towards achieving international climate targets and support the UK's commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050.

""Producing SAF domestically in the UK carries several economic and strategic advantages. First and foremost, producing SAF in the UK will increase availability, addressing a key concern around security of supplies, as well as helping to reduce overall costs as the industry is scaled up.

""Domestic production of SAF can have wider national benefits too, such as stimulating economic growth by creating new jobs across the supply chain, from feedstock production to fuel distribution. This has the potential to benefit local economies, particularly in rural areas where biomass feedstocks are sourced, and in industrial regions where new SAF production facilities are established.

""Domestic production enhances energy security by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels. By developing a domestic SAF industry, the UK can insulate itself from global oil price volatility and geopolitical risks associated with fossil fuel imports.

""Furthermore, investing in domestic SAF production has the potential to position the UK as a global leader in sustainable aviation, allowing for the influencing of international policies and markets. Logistics UK has been calling for government to invest in UK production of SAF to achieve these aims, most notably to support the aviation sector by both increasing availability and reducing the cost of SAF.

""The rapid advancement seen in the implementation of SAF has largely been driven by robust governmental support, which must be maintained and expanded by the next incoming government. Consistency in policy and regulation is vital to ensuring long-term planning and investment stability, ensuring SAF is more competitive with conventional jet fuel.

""SAF is now a proven technology and used in aircraft today, therefore attention must turn to addressing barriers around costs and increasing production to meet rising demands. It will be essential to expand feedstocks beyond HEFA, to include other sustainable sources such as waste. These options should be explored without passing along costs to industry. The government must maintain pace with the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM), whilst also progressing the SAF mandate within the legislative process, to ensure that combined, both can help deliver the necessary UK SAF market.

""A key challenge for emerging SAF projects is the uncertainty of revenue streams, which can deter investment and hinder the growth of the industry. Implementing a SAF revenue certainty mechanism is crucial to reducing financial risks and attracting investment. A revenue certainty mechanism should be delivered earlier than Q4 2026, given the SAF mandate will be introduced from 2025.

""By ensuring revenue certainty, investors will have greater confidence in the long-term viability of SAF projects, leading to increased capital inflow and faster development of production facilities. This, in turn, helps to build a robust SAF supply chain, reduce production costs through economies of scale and achieve widespread adoption of SAF across the aviation sector.""

Accra, May 20, GNA – The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is set to begin feasibility studies on Ghana’s capacity to develop and produce Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).

If successful, the studies will enable Ghana to begin developing and producing SAF as an alternative to fossil fuels.

Speaking at the two-day Capacity Building for SAF workshop in Accra on Tuesday, Madam Juliet Okine, Deputy Director-General for Finance and Administration, Ghana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) expressed optimism that the feasibility studies would be successful to pave the way for SAF development.

She said that Ghana could develop and produce SAF to reduce airline dependence on fossil fuels because the feedstock, used cooking oil, and waste materials, essential for SAF production, are abundant in Ghana.

“The country has what it takes to promote SAF production.

“Ghana Civil Aviation Authority, as the agency of the Ministry of Transport responsible for regulating aviation in Ghana, remains optimistic that the feasibility studies will be successful,” she said.

The workshop, organised by GCAA in collaboration with ICAO, aimed to provide technical assistance to Ghana in harnessing its capabilities for SAF development and deployment.

It forms part of ICAO’s Assistance Capability Building and Training for SAF (ACT SAF) project, funded by the United Kingdom.

Madam Okine urged ministries including Finance, Food and Agriculture, Environment, Energy, and Green Transition to support GCAA in achieving its goals.

She noted that SAF development would create jobs, business opportunities for youth, and promote sustainable economic growth.

Mr. Joseph Bukari Nikpe, Minister of Transport, said aviation was a major contributor to global carbon emissions, posing threats to the environment, economy, and future generations.

ICAO estimates that aviation contributes two to three per cent of global carbon emissions.

Mr. Nikpe stressed the need for proactive measures to transition towards cleaner, sustainable fuels.

“SAF has the potential to reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel,” he said.

“It can power today’s aircraft engines without modification, making it an immediate and viable solution for greener air travel,” Mr. Nikpe added.

He called on the private sector to actively participate in the SAF project.

Mr. Cesar Velarde, ICAO ACT-SAF Project Coordinator, described SAF as both an environmental and socio-economic opportunity for Ghana.

For the next two days, industry stakeholders and government officials will meet to identify challenges affecting SAF production.

He also pledged ICAO’s assistance in helping Ghana realise its SAF goals.

“This workshop is just the kick-off of a six-month assistance project that will consist of a first feasibility study for SAF,” he said.

Mr. John Dumelo, Deputy Minister of Food and Agriculture, lauded the initiative, noting that SAF development would create new value chains in agriculture, stimulating demand for energy crops and agricultural residues.

“Our Ministry stands ready to work with GCAA, the Ministry of Energy, ICAO, and other partners to assess the availability and sustainability of agricultural feedstock for SAF production,” he said.

Mr. Hassan Tampuli, a member of the Parliamentary Committee on Road and Transport assured GCAA and ICAO of Parliament’s commitment to supporting SAF with the necessary legislation to maximise its benefits.

That makes it a key part of the fight to decarbonize our transportation networks, with the aviation sector a small but rapidly growing contributor of carbon emissions, but one that is difficult to abate as alternative propulsion methods are likely to be decades away.

As such, carbon reduction schemes and the fuel itself are at the forefront of efforts to lead on reducing the environmental impact of commercial flight. Governments across the world are investigating ways to decarbonize aviation, but it is the European Union that has taken the lead by setting an expectation that the bloc will be carbon neutral by 2050 and implementing an ambitious pathway of mandates to drive adoption.

As such, the expected growth in demand for SAF between now and 2050 is likely to bring profound consequences for the feedstock slate – the combination of waste-based or vegetable oil-based fats that are expected to be swept into the SAF production process.

What is the new Fastmarkets European SAF price, announced by Fastmarkets?

Fastmarkets recognises that such dramatic change needs effective pricing markers to enable those caught up in this transition to be able to understand the impact of price movements across regions, feedstocks and production margins. Reliable pricing information enables informed choices and paves the way for effective risk management solutions.

The value of a commodity can be established through analysis of physical price indications, or in other ways, such as calculating input and production costs to establish a finished product price. Fastmarkets is proposing to launch its first European SAF price based on a cost-of-production model, backed by the superior coverage of relevant feedstocks, which is the backbone of Fastmarkets agriculture and biofuel feedstock offerings.

This also aligns with our existing trio of US-based SAF prices, where we are already publishing a base cost assessment for ex-works US Gulf SAF, delivered Los Angeles SAF and delivered Chicago SAF.

What are the challenges in serving the developing SAF market with price assessments?

In a fast-evolving market such as SAF, there are challenges to capturing pricing data when a spot market – the physical market where excess supply can be traded – is relatively small and nascent, or where there are few players actively trading small volumes. Price reporting agencies such as Fastmarkets typically look for physical indications with bids, offers and confirmed trades providing evidence of where values are trading. By establishing a clear methodology, traders and other market participants can be confident that the price reflects an impartial view of those transactions

However, when a market is evolving rapidly, pricing information may be limited or only reflect buying patterns of a handful of counterparties, meaning that the price can be prone to sharp fluctuations. Under those circumstances, alternative ways of establishing a credible value can also be pursued, such as establishing a cost-of-production model, or an origin plus freight calculation.

What is the difference between a calculated price and an assessed price?

Fastmarkets has chosen to launch a calculated price to serve the European SAF market, allowing a transparent value to be established based on the assessed values of key feedstocks. We believe that this is the right solution for the current stage of the evolving European SAF market and allows Fastmarkets to establish an indicative price that is still grounded in real-world inputs and reflects a dynamic market. A calculated price ensures a regular, predictable, and logical assessment, but will not capture the dynamics of supply and demand that could result in a much higher or much lower price.

An assessed price is predicated on being able to capture enough pricing information from buyers, sellers, traders, and producers to power a transparent assessment under an agreed methodology. That price would consequently reflect dynamics of supply and demand and would likely price sometimes well below the cost of production, and sometimes well above it, according to market conditions. However, a reliable assessment would require access to a wide range of physical indications that can be transparently cross-checked and validated with trade sources. Until the market has reached that level of maturity, there is a risk that an assessed price could show dramatic swings.

Why is it the right time to launch a European SAF assessment?

From January 1, 2025, the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation policy entered into effect, requiring all European Union airports to ensure that a minimum of 2% of the overall supply of jet fuel supplied into departing aircraft with be SAF. The EU describes the increased use of SAF in the bloc’s aviation fuel supply as the “single most powerful tool to decrease aviation CO2 emissions.”

The mandate is expected to increase every five years through to 2050, rising to 6% in 2030, 20% by 2035, 34% in 2040, before a final push raises the target to 42% in 2045 and finally 70% by 2050 – a mandate that would amount to millions of tonnes of SAF production and consumption in less than three decades.

While the mandate promotes both conventional jet fuel and so-called efuels – synthetic fuels achieved through complex production processes that blend carbon with hydrogen – the vast majority of the early stages of the EU mandate will have to be met through fuels that are reliant upon used cooking oils, tallows and other animal fats potentially alongside other crop-based vegetable oil or corn oils, where permitted.

Who should be interested in the launch?

Primarily, the launch should be of interest to those within the aviation sector – particularly airlines, aircraft operators and the wider freight and logistics industry, along with agriculture and energy trading companies, conventional oil and gas majors, airports and airport infrastructure, biofuel producers, transport and energy analysts and other players active in the renewable energy transition.

Further out, everyone that is currently using feedstocks identified as ‘waste-based’ will also be increasingly affected by this transition, such as packaged food or pet food producers, conventional biofuel producers, renderers, aircraft and engine makers, regulatory and government agencies and anyone else using the major feedstocks that will be pulled into the SAF production pool.

Why should they be interested?

The growth of demand for SAF will have profound implications for the current trade flows around mineral jet fuel, SAF and the typical feedstocks as they are pulled into the increasing production of renewable fuels. It will disrupt feedstocks in existing biofuel production and have a significant impact on anyone using feedstocks for any other purpose.

In turn, these changes will have a knock-on effect for a range of staple business activities from long term procurement planning, and carbon reduction strategies through to compliance with regulations. The changes will also have a major impact on risk management strategies.

Why is Fastmarkets’ SAF assessment Northwest Europe-based?

Geolocating the assessment in Northwest Europe means that we are able to provide a pivotal production, supply and logistics hub in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp region, while also capturing demand side economics stemming from some of wider Europe’s busiest airports at Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London.

What is the methodology behind the Fastmarkets SAF spot price assessment?

Fastmarkets is proposing to use a calculated cost-of-production model to establish a price for European SAF basis the Rotterdam region. The assessment will combine Fastmarkets own assessments of key feedstocks such as used cooking oil and tallow with assumed costs for major inputs such as hydrogen.

Oil spills remain one of the most pressing environmental threats for the sea. The largest marine oil spill ever, the Deepwater Horizon slick in the Gulf of Mexico, spilled more than 134 million gallons of oil into the ocean.

Closer to home, oil spills are also a threat in the Netherlands too, particularly in the country’s ports and small waterways. These incidents pose risks to local ecosystems and demand swift action to minimise their impact. Traditional response methods – although effective – are often time-consuming, especially when a rapid cleanup can mean the difference between a minor incident and a major ecological disaster.

Recognising the urgent need for progress in the field, FruitPunch AI launched the ‘AI Against Oil Spills’ project, in collaboration with Rijkswaterstaat, the Dutch government body responsible for water management. The aim of the project was to try and understand how artificial intelligence could accelerate and improve oil spill detection and management in open seas, in ports and in inland waterways.

AI Against Oil Spills

To understand the opportunity for improvement, it is first key to understand the current way of working. Rijkswaterstaat currently deploys drone teams to capture aerial images of oil spills. Experts then manually review these images to estimate the volume of each spill, helping them determine the best cleanup strategy.

But this manual process is far from fast. While some inland spills can be assessed quickly using contextual information, spills at sea often require full segmentation of the affected area, an exercise that can take several hours. In a situation where time can be of critical importance, every minute lost is a missed opportunity to protect the environment and can spell the difference between a minor or major ecological disaster.

Valcon joined the ‘AI Against Oil Spills’ project, fielding a team of data experts to explore how they could potentially use AI for detecting oil spills and to improve the cleanup work at Rijkswaterstaat. The vision was to create an automated, AI-driven process that could replace manual inspection with real-time analysis, which could save hours of expert time and enable faster intervention.

A leading consulting firm with offices across Europe, Valcon developed a proof of concept to explore how to significantly reduce the time required to analyse drone imagery and estimate spill volumes. The proof of concept was developed through a three-stage approach:

Stage one: preparing the data

Like many real-world AI projects, the first hurdle was the data itself. The aerial images collected were not fully labelled and the scope of oil spills were often difficult to distinguish due to poor contrast or unclear boundaries. The Valcon team processed and edited the images to enhance the visibility of the oil, then manually re-labelled them to create a high-quality dataset suitable for machine learning.

Stage two: training the model

Next, Valcon trained several AI models to perform image segmentation, teaching the system to detect and outline oil spills from drone footage. The models learned to recognise patterns and textures indicative of oil, providing a visual map of the spill area in each image.

Stage three: estimating spill volume

The Valcon and Fruitpunch AI team developed a method to estimate spill volume based on the segmented images. By incorporating image metadata, such as drone altitude and camera settings, the AI could calculate a reliable volume estimate. Meaning that when a new drone image is uploaded, the AI tool can automatically outline the spill and calculate the volume within minutes.

The proof of concept

The proof of concept has demonstrated major potential for value added. The first major benefit is the speeding up of spill estimation. What currently takes hours could be done in minutes. The new AI-driven model provides Rijkswaterstaat with rapid volume estimates, enabling quicker and more targeted clean-up operations, which helps protect sensitive waterways before the damage spreads.

The second advantage of the proof of concept is the improvement of data collection. Valcon identified improvements to drone image collection that could boost the AI's accuracy, factors such as the shoreline comprising around 30% of the frame of each image, which could serve as reference points to locate the spill.

And while the model achieves around 70% accuracy in oil spill detection, it can help to guide the team, helping them make quicker decisions and hopefully reduce inspection time and enable faster environmental response.

AI to the use

“We are delighted to have supported FruitPunch AI and Rijkswaterstaat with the proof of concept. It showcases the powerful role AI could play in solving real-world environmental challenges, and how technology and human expertise can come together to co-create unique innovations.”",https://www.consultancy.eu/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-05-20-114910341-Using_AI_to_better_detect_and_tackle_oil_spills_in_open_seas_and_inland_waterways_spot.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 12:57:25.417643

The project, which includes investors Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, is located in Reeves County, Texas, near the city of Pecos.

The site is expected to become the world’s largest eFuels production facility when operational, producing 23,000 tonnes per year (7.6 million gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other eFuel products for customers including global aviation leaders American Airlines and IAG, owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and other international airline brands.

“Infinium’s Project Roadrunner marks a huge achievement for the fuel industry,” said Infinium CEO Robert Schuetzle. “Not only will the project produce commercial eSAF for its customers, it will bring highly skilled jobs and economic growth to the Pecos community and state of Texas. This project demonstrates the ongoing commitment of Infinium, its investors, and partners to help ensure that the United States remains a global leader in energy security, resilience and innovation.”

eFuels are synthetic fuels, produced from waste CO2 and renewable energy, that are chemically identical to conventional petroleum-based fuels. These drop-in fuels are used in the transportation and chemicals sectors, seamlessly integrating with existing engines, infrastructure, and manufacturing processes. Infinium eFuels provide an opportunity for energy diversification while leveraging the global infrastructure that powers the transportation and chemicals industries today. In 2023, Infinium became the world’s first to produce and ship commercial volumes of eFuels to customers in the U.S. and Europe from its production facility, Project Pathfinder, in Corpus Christi, Texas.

The Roadrunner project reached financial close with investments from Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and is now under construction. The project represents significant investment in the region and will support highly skilled direct labor jobs in construction, fabrication, operations, and logistics locally and across Texas. Commercial agreements for the project—including feedstock, vendor and offtake contracts — have been structured and de-risked to attract the infrastructure capital and debt required for the continued scaling of the eFuels market.

Infinium’s Project Roadrunner facility will convert waste CO2 and renewable energy to produce sustainable aviation fuel, leveraging new renewable power assets purpose-built for the project. The fuels produced by the Roadrunner project will be sold domestically in the U.S. and exported to international markets. Under a landmark agreement with airline group IAG, the eSAF will be shipped to the UK to satisfy compliance requirements under the recently enacted UK SAF Mandate which requires that at least 10% of all jet fuel in flights taking off from the UK is sourced from sustainable feedstocks by 2030.

“The construction of Project Roadrunner represents a real step forward in the production of sustainable aviation fuel at scale,” said Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s Group Sustainability Officer. “We’re proud to be an early customer of Infinium’s eSAF and working hard to procure and invest in SAF to deliver our 10% 2030 SAF goal. The aviation industry is making progress, but continued support and stronger incentives are necessary to accelerate production at the scale and pace required to ensure a long-term, affordable supply.”

Currently under construction, the facility is expected to reach commercial operations in 2027. Roadrunner has secured 150 MW of new wind generation capacity from a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources through a long-term power purchase agreement.

""We are pleased to support Infinium’s Roadrunner project, which reflects a significant step forward for an emerging new market for renewable electricity,” said Petter Skantze, Senior Vice President, Infrastructure Development for NextEra Energy Resources. “The United States has tremendous potential to use its abundant energy resources to serve global demand, and we’re excited to expand our investment in Texas to enable Infinium’s industry-leading electro-fuels production facility.""

Infinium selected leading electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen to supply its complete 100 megawatt (MW) HYPRPlant solution for the project, which will be integrated on site for green hydrogen production1. This large-scale system will not only produce hydrogen for the eSAF facility but will also have capacity to support future hydrogen offtake opportunities.

“Infinium’s Project Roadrunner stands as a remarkable example of how next-generation technologies can rapidly evolve from proof-of-concept to finance-ready infrastructure,” said Mario Fernandez, Head of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. “At BE Catalyst, we are proud to have partnered with Infinium from the onset to help shape this project, positioning it to attract the necessary infrastructure capital required to scale and accelerate the delivery of eFuels into the market.”

“Our investments in Infinium and Project Roadrunner are the first Brookfield has committed to sustainable aviation fuel,” said Laura Hellman, Senior Vice President at Brookfield. “We are excited about our partnership with Infinium which will help advance sustainability within the aviation sector consistent with the goals of our investment strategy.”

The Roadrunner project underscores expanded support for innovative solutions that meet the market’s growing demand for resilient energy supply chains, while decarbonizing and utilizing products that leverage the existing infrastructure and engines in use today. By enabling eFuels to be used as pure fuel or blended with petroleum-based products, Infinium solutions can be used to significantly reduce the overall carbon footprint of the energy supply chain. Supported by top industry leaders in energy and infrastructure, Infinium is expanding its development of eFuel facilities both across the U.S. and internationally. This growth will not only contribute to the expansion and diversification of fuel market supply options but also offer low-carbon alternatives to augment conventional fuels relied on today.

However, scaling up its production and adoption requires a clear understanding of national potential, policy frameworks, technical capacity, and investment opportunities.”

The Minister reaffirmed the government’s unwavering commitment to fostering a sustainable, resilient, and innovative aviation sector.

“We will continue to work closely with ICAO, our regional partners, and all stakeholders to realize the promise of sustainable aviation fuels,” Nikpe added.

According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the aviation industry contributes approximately 2–3% of global carbon emissions. ICAO has responded to the global call for decarbonization by identifying Sustainable Aviation Fuel as one of the key strategies for reducing CO₂ emissions.

Ghana, recognising that passenger numbers and aircraft movements are rising post-COVID-19, emphasizes the need for aviation sector growth to align with global climate goals.

As part of ICAO’s initiative to assess member states’ capabilities, feasibility studies on SAF development and deployment are being conducted. Ghana has been selected as one of the countries to benefit from these studies and workshops.

The Director-General of the GCAA expressed confidence in the process, stating, “Ghana remains optimistic that the feasibility studies will be successful.”

France consults on expanded biofuels mandate

London, 15 May (Argus) — France has opened consultation on the transposition of part of the recast renewable energy directive (RED III) into national law, which would replace the current system with a new one called ""incentive for the reduction of the carbon intensity of fuels"" (IRICC). The proposal introduces two separate sets of requirements for transport fuels. The first is for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions, broken down by transport sectors — road, aviation, maritime, LPG and natural gas for vehicles, which could be CNG or LNG (see table). In the current draft, the GHG reduction target for the road sector will start at 5.9pc in 2026, rising to 10.6pc in 2030 and 18.7pc in 2035. For aviation, the target starts at 2.5pc in 2026, rising to 5.8pc in 2030 and 18.8pc in 2035. The GHG mandate levels include a gradual phasing-in of new fuel sectors – river and maritime fuels, fuel gasses, and aviation. To meet the overall RED III target of 14.5pc emissions reduction by 2030, the national French target includes the biofuels mandates, a share for rail transport, and a share or private vehicle charging. The second set of requirements is a renewable fuel requirement by energy content, which is broken down by fuel type — diesel, gasoline, LPG and natural gas fuels and marine fuel (see table). The blending requirements for diesel start at 9pc in 2026, rising to 11.4pc in 2030 and 16pc in 2035. For gasoline, the mandates start at 9.5pc in 2026, rising to 10.5pc in 2030 and 14.5pc in 2035. Finally, the proposal includes a set of sub-mandates for advanced fuels and renewable hydrogen . The advanced biofuels mandate would start at 0.7pc in 2026, rising to 1.95pc in 2030 and 2.6pc in 2035. Users of renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) would not be subject to the advanced sub-mandate. In feedstock restrictions, the crop cap will rise to 7pc from 6.2pc in 2030 and 2035, while the limit for fuels made from feedstocks found in Annex IX-B of RED will be at 0.6pc in 2026, 0.7pc in 2030 and 1pc in 2035 for diesel and petrol. Aviation fuel will not have a IX-B cap until 2030, and from then it will be 6pc. Mandate compliance would be managed by a certificate system through the CarbuRe registry, with a compliance deadline of 1 March the following year. Public electric vehicle charging would also generate tickets, although the amount of tickets generated by charging light passenger vehicles would be reduced from 2031 to reach 50pc in 2035. Renewable hydrogen used in transport would also generate tickets counting towards the hydrogen sub-quota and reduce the overall GHG savings requirement. Public charging stations will start generating fewer tickets for electric passenger vehicles from 2031 to 50pc by 2035. France is also considering steep penalties for non-compliance, at €700/t CO2 not avoided for the GHG reduction requirement and at €40/GJ for the fuel targets. The penalty for not meeting hydrogen and advanced fuel sub-targets would be doubled, at €80/GJ. The consultation is open for comments until 10 June.

UK ethanol sector sees lower prices from US trade deal

London, 14 May (Argus) — The UK ethanol sector expects prices to fall because of the recent trade deal with the US, but participants are divided on the scale of the effect. The trade deal has cut import duties on US ethanol to zero on higher volumes than recent import levels, raising the prospect of large amounts of US product crossing the Atlantic. The UK was the second largest destination for US ethanol exports in 2024, taking more than 923mn l, or 13pc of all exports, according to US industry group Renewable Fuels Association. The UK imposed a duty of £16/hectolitre ($21/hectolitre) for undenatured ethanol and £8.50/hectolitre for denatured ethanol, which the trade deal will remove. Zero tariffs will be applied to up to 1.4bn l/yr. European renewable ethanol association ePure told Argus the deal presents a ""huge problem"" for UK and EU ethanol producers, a view echoed by some UK market participants. But some active in the UK ethanol market have said that while they do not expect greater amounts of ethanol to arrive in the country, they do anticipate lower prices and lower domestic production. The operators of the UK's two major ethanol-producing facilities, Vivergo and Cropenergies, said there will be zero tariffs on ""the size of the UK's whole ethanol market"", and said they may have to close. According to Argus data the total UK production capacity for wheat-based ethanol is over 736mn l/yr. The National Farmers' Union expressed concern about the deal's effect on arable farmers, and said it is ""working through what this means for the viability of the domestic bioethanol production."" Although a healthy share of the total import pool from the US is waste-based, the UK government is consulting on whether to continue classing the main waste feedstock imported from the US as eligible for double counting under its renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO). Staging post UK producers may still seek to maximise imports from the US for onward export into the EU. The current EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) allows for zero tariffs and quotas on all trade of UK and EU goods that comply with appropriate rules or origin. But with this new deal, there is an increased chance of US ethanol entering the EU via the UK, Epure said. ""Under existing customs rules US ethanol can be mixed with UK ethanol and thus avoid an EU duty,"" it said. This may include major proportion, which limits the share of non-originating materials to claim UK origin, or inward processing relief, which allows for imports to be processed without paying import duties or value added tax (VAT) before re-export. Some market participants contested the extent to which UK-EU flows of ethanol with partial US origin might happen, suggesting the imported ethanol would need to undergo a significant chemical change to be classified as duty free, such as being used as feedstock for products including ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE). EPure said the EU should be wary, and called for ethanol to be included in a final list of products subject to EU countermeasures, as it was in a recent proposal from the bloc currently under public consultation.

Ampol imports Australia's largest SAF cargo into Sydney

Sydney, 14 May (Argus) — Australian fuel retailer and refiner Ampol imported a cargo of nearly 2mn litres (700t) of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into Sydney Airport on 7 May, marking the largest ever commercial SAF import into Australia. The fuel — sourced from Malaysia — was imported into Ampol's Kurnell facility near Sydney Airport, where the former's oil refinery has direct pipeline access into the airports refuelling the supply chain. There are no plans to import more SAF cargoes into Sydney Airport in the near term, a source close to the matter said. Ampol's managing director and chief executive officer, Matthew Halliday, said ""this delivery marks Ampol's first major import of SAF into Australia and leverages our advanced supply chain infrastructure to deliver this product directly from a key domestic fuel terminal to the nation's busiest airport."" Sydney Airport accounts for nearly 40pc of Australia's total jet fuel consumption, according to the airport's chief executive officer Scott Charlton. The announcement came a day after Ampol said it is shifting its focus to electric vehicle charging and renewable fuels , by selling its electricity retail businesses in Australia and New Zealand. Australian airline Qantas is the end user of the imported SAF cargo.The fuel, once blended at a ratio of approximately 18pc, could power the equivalent of 900 flights from Sydney to Auckland on Qantas 737 aircraft, Qantas said. This will cut resulting carbon emissions from those flights by a total estimated 3,400t, it added. Qantas is targeting 10pc of its fuel use to come from SAF by 2030 and approximately 60pc by 2050. Qantas' chief executive officer Vanessa Hudson said ""the creation of a SAF industry is key to our efforts towards the decarbonisation of aviation, increasing Australia's fuel security and creating thousands of new jobs across our economy … we pick up 70pc of our fuel in Australia so we're looking forward to working closely with the government to chart the next course for SAF in Australia."" This import of SAF follows the signing of an initial agreement between Qantas and Sydney Airport to work together to further facilitate the development of a domestic SAF industry in Australia. If established, domestic SAF production has the potential to contribute approximately A$13bn/yr ($8.4bn/yr) in gross domestic product by 2040, while supporting nearly 13,000 jobs in the feedstock supply chain and creating 5,000 new jobs to build and run the facilities, according to a Qantas and Airbus ICF report published in 2023. Consultations on a potential biofuels mandate in New South Wales (NSW) are expected to begin in the near future. NSW minister for climate change, energy and environment, Penny Sharpe, said ""we want to see a strong domestic SAF industry here in NSW, which is a win-win for jobs, fuel security and the planet"".

🟦 6) Green Hydrogen Applications Green hydrogen has several important applications.
First, green hydrogen can be subjected to liquefaction, resulting in green liquid hydrogen.
Furthermore, captured CO₂ can also undergo methanation with green hydrogen, leading to the production of e-methane (CH₄).
Lastly, captured CO₂ can react with green hydrogen via the Fischer-Tropsch process, resulting in e-kerosene, an ASTM D7566-qualified fuel.","From Hydrogen to SAF Hydrogen plays a crucial role in the production pathways of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). 🟦 1) Why Hydrogen? Decarbonized hydrogen produces no CO₂ and can reduce non-CO₂ emissions and persistent contrails. As production costs decline with increasing industry acceptance, hydrogen's versatility allows it to be used as Sustainable Aviation Fuel or directly in aircraft by 2050. 🟦 2) Hydrogen Application The HEFA process encompasses various catalytic reaction mechanisms, which require hydrogen as an input. In a similar fashion, the ATJ process also requires hydrogen for its operation. Conversely, the Fischer Tropsch processes do not need hydrogen when utilising biomass feedstock, like forestry residues or municipal solid waste (MSW). However, hydrogen is crucial when the feedstock is comprised of CO₂. 🟦 3) E-Fuels from CO₂ 1- Synthesis gas generation via eREACT RWGS H₂ ➕ CO₂ [Captured] ⇒ H₂O ➕ CO 2- Fischer-Tropsch Process 2nH₂ ➕ nCO ⇒ nH₂O ➕ (-CH₂-)n 3- Hydrocracking H₂ ➕ (-CH₂-)n ⇒ 2(-CH₂-)1/2n 🟦 4) e-fuel from Hydrogen and CO₂ E-fuel can be produced from hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The process begins with water and renewable electricity, which undergoes electrolysis using solid oxide electrolyzer cells (SOEC) to generate hydrogen and captured carbon. This is followed by the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, leading to hydrocracking to create G2L e-fuels (FT-SPK). Hydroprocessing G2LTM then refines the products to produce e-jet fuel, e-diesel, and e-naphtha, which meet ASTM standards D975 and EN15940. 🟦 5) Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOEC) for eSAF production SOEC (Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells) represents the most efficient electrolyzer available, boasting a 30% increase in efficiency through heat integration compared to alkaline and PEM systems. Constructed from non-precious materials, its scalability does not raise concerns over material scarcity or cost escalation. Besides steam electrolysis, SOEC also converts CO₂ into carbon monoxide (eCO), enhancing carbon capture and enabling the production of e-fuels such as eJet, e-Diesel, and methanol. 🟦 6) Green Hydrogen Applications Green hydrogen has several important applications. First, green hydrogen can be subjected to liquefaction, resulting in green liquid hydrogen. Second, when nitrogen (N₂) combines with green hydrogen through the Haber-Bosch process, it produces ammonia (NH₃). Additionally, captured carbon dioxide (CO₂) can react with green hydrogen to synthesize e-methanol (CH₃OH). Furthermore, captured CO₂ can also undergo methanation with green hydrogen, leading to the production of e-methane (CH₄). Lastly, captured CO₂ can react with green hydrogen via the Fischer-Tropsch process, resulting in e-kerosene, an ASTM D7566-qualified fuel. Source: → see post image.

Through this agreement, FedEx has purchased blended fuel from Neste, to include a minimum of 30% neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel. As used in its blended form, the fuel will account for roughly a fifth of all jet fuel consumed annually by FedEx at LAX* and is the largest SAF purchase executed by a U.S. cargo airline at LAX to-date. Delivery of the fuel began earlier this month and will continue over the next year.

“Procuring SAF is an important component of our aviation emissions-reduction strategy in the coming years, and we are pleased to have executed a deal with Neste to begin using this fuel in our air operations,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, chief sustainability officer and vice president of Environmental Affairs, FedEx. “Our aviation network represents the largest amount of FedEx fuel use globally and, as a result, is our biggest opportunity to drive down emissions. As we work toward our goal of carbon-neural operations by 2040, we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.”

“As the world’s preeminent express transportation company, our initial U.S. deployment of this fuel advances our sustainability goals and bolsters the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF,” said Richard Smith, chief operating officer, International, and chief executive officer, Airline, FedEx. “While we know further growth of the SAF market is needed—alongside other innovations—we are proud to celebrate this milestone with our world-class air network.”

“Neste is excited to work with FedEx and support their ambitious goal of reaching carbon-neutral operations by 2040 with our SAF. Recognizing the important role of air cargo in the global economy, FedEx is demonstrating how this industry can leverage available lower-emission solutions like SAF to reduce its environmental impact. We look forward to further strengthening our cooperation,” says Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste.

This fuel purchase by FedEx builds upon years of the company’s efforts to co-create innovative sustainable aviation technologies with other industry leaders, including the ecoDemonstrator flight-test program with Boeing—the world’s first commercial airplane flight using 100% SAF in both engines that was conducted in 2018. In addition to the procurement of SAF, FedEx is pursuing multiple avenues to improve efficiency and reduce fuel consumption in its aviation operations overall, including aircraft fleet modernization, fuel conservation initiatives, and flight planning optimization. Collectively, fleet modernization and fuel saving efforts enabled FedEx in fiscal year 2024 to successfully achieve its goal of a 30% reduction in aviation emissions intensity from a 2005 baseline. FedEx set its first aviation emissions intensity reduction goals back in 2008.

Sustainable aviation fuel, explained

Sustainable aviation fuel is a more sustainable alternative to conventional, fossil-based jet fuel, largely driven by lower emissions from the feedstocks used in the fuel production process. Neat SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel before use and is considered a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it works within existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure without any equipment updates.

Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%** over the fuel’s life cycle, compared to using conventional jet fuel. Neste SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste.

While SAF production continues to grow in the U.S. and internationally, SAF accounted for less than 1% of all global jet fuel production in 2024. Amid the need for greater alternative fuel availability and accessibility for all airlines, FedEx will continue to advocate for expanded production and highlight SAF’s potential environmental and economic benefits.

Located in Pecos, Project Roadrunner is expected to be the world’s largest commercial green hydrogen-based SAF project from 2027.

Infinium said it “reached financial close” last September, following investments from Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst.

Yesterday, Infinium selected Electric Hydrogen’s 100 MW PEM electrolyser plant for its flagship project. However, contract details were thin, with no information shared on how many plants will be provided, the timeline or the nature of the agreement.

The Roadrunner initiative is set to supply e-fuels to International Airlines Group (IAG), which owns British Airways, Iberia and more, under a 10-year deal.

Furthermore, the plant will be supported by 150 megawatts of new wind generation capacity from a NextEra Energy subsidiary under a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA).

Project Roadrunner builds on the platform of Project Pathfinder, Infinium’s first commercial facility in Corpus Christi. In 2023, the company became the first to produce and ship commercial volumes of e-fuels to customers.

Infinium CEO Robert Schuetzle said the start of construction will help ensure the US “remains a global leader in energy security, resilience and innovation.”

Construction begins as the US clean fuels industry faces growing uncertainty.

A House committee recently approved a tax package that would repeal the 45V clean hydrogen production tax credit, setting the stage for a congressional debate.

Under the proposal, hydrogen projects beginning construction after 31 December 2025 would no longer be eligible, severely undercutting the long-term value of the credit.

Infinium’s project, however, has broken ground ahead of the deadline.","https://www.h2-view.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.h2-view.com/wp-content/files/Screenshot-2025-05-20-at-10.53.50.png",N,,2025-05-20 11:58:16.992857

Swiss startup Metafuels will develop a synthetic SAF plant in Rotterdam, aiming to scale greener jet fuel production in Europe.

Swiss aviation tech firm Metafuels AG is set to develop a new synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) plant at the Port of Rotterdam. The project, named Turbe, marks a significant step in the commercial rollout of Metafuels’ proprietary aerobrew methanol-to-jet technology.

Evos’ partnership enables scalable Sustainable Aviation Fuel production

Metafuels is partnering with Evos to integrate the plant into its existing Rotterdam terminal. Evos is a major European player in liquid energy and chemical storage, operating the continent’s largest ethanol storage facility and a key multimodal methanol hub.

Turbe will initially produce 12,000 litres of e-SAF per day, with a second phase targeting a tenfold increase to 120,000 litres daily. This expansion follows Metafuels’ 2024 announcement of its Denmark-based Pizol facility.

The company has raised $22 million since its founding, including a $5 million grant from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, positioning it among Europe’s best-funded SAF startups.

Metafuels’ aerobrew process converts bio- or e-methanol into jet fuel with high energy efficiency and up to 90% lower lifecycle emissions. As a drop-in fuel, it is compatible with current aircraft and infrastructure, offering a scalable solution for aviation decarbonisation.

“The aviation sector accounts for over 2% of global CO2 emissions,” the company noted, highlighting the importance of e-SAF in climate mitigation. Bio-methanol can be derived from biological waste, while e-methanol uses renewable electricity and captured carbon.

The Rotterdam project supports EU decarbonisation goals under initiatives such as RefuelEU Aviation and CORSIA. Europe is expected to lead in e-fuel adoption, with the EU’s synthetic SAF sub-mandate rising from 1.2% in 2030 to 35% by 2050.

Metafuels CEO Saurabh Kapoor said: “This first-of-a-kind commercial plant represents a major step forward… Europe has ambitious decarbonisation targets, but without scalable and affordable SAF production, aviation will struggle to keep up.”

Evos Rotterdam MD Christiaan Kop added: “We are poised to support the deployment of Metafuels’ sustainable aviation fuel project.”

Port of Rotterdam CEO Boudewijn Siemons concluded: “This development contributes to the climate goals for aviation and further strengthens Rotterdam’s position as a leading hub for renewable fuels.”",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2320824307-1-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 06:56:53.511909

Paris-Orly Airport Facing Delays After Technical Issue

The Authority has also advised airlines to cut their flights down by 15% to alleviate the workload on Paris ‘second’ airport – following asking for a 40% reduction on Sunday.

In a statement, the DGCA said:

“The situation is improving. Despite these preventive measures, delays are expected.”

Paris-Orly predominantly focuses on internal and European flights, and with around 130 flights to Portugal, Spain, and Southern France being affected, the delays and cancellations will have a marked effect on the airport.

The good news is that, following specific cancellations to Porto, Helsinki, and Rome, amongst others this morning, fewer flights appeared to be delayed this afternoon.

Advice for Travellers

Under EU law, passengers will receive a refund for cancelled flights.

However, passengers will be unlikely to receive any further compensation for cancelled services at Paris-Orly. This is because airlines will argue that the air traffic control was under ‘extraordinary circumstances’ and that could not be avoided.

Meanwhile, any passengers facing a delay overnight, are obliged to contact their airline, who may find and pay for accommodation overnight.

More About Paris-Orly Airport

Initially home to two large Airship Hangars, Paris-Orly was opened as Villeneuve-Orly Airport in 1932.

During World War Two, the airport was occupied by the Luftwaffe, and predominantly used by both fighters and bombers, throughout the war.

Following the Allied victory, allied control was handed to the United States Army Air Force, before being returned to French control in 1947.

By 1958, Pan-Am, TWA, and Air France were regularly flying commercial flights to as far afield as New York, Los Angeles, and Tokyo.

Always considerably smaller than Charles de Gaulle Airport, with 33.1 million passengers in 2024 compared to Charles de Gaulle’s 70 million, the airport has seen a number of issues and difficulties in recent years.

In 2015, during foggy weather, the system used to communicate with pilots during adverse weather failed. As a result, with pilots unable to communicate with the airport, flights were cancelled and the airport briefly suspended operation.

Finally, in 2020, Paris-Orly was closed entirely during the Covid-19 Pandemic, with flights redirected to Charles de Gaulle for the duration of France’s lockdown.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Aeroport_Orly_Ouest_2011_04-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 06:57:13.058791

STEPHEN BRIDGEWATER FRAeS reports.

Almost a year to the day since taking over as Finnair’s CEO, Turkka Kuusisto, was the guest of honour at a lunch held by The Aviation Club UK at the Royal Over-Seas League in London on 30 April.

The son of a Finnair pilot, Kuusisto has a long history at the helm of successful businesses, not least the Finnish postal service. However, running the fifth oldest surviving airline (101 years old this year) has not come without its challenges and, in an enjoyable fireside chat, The Aviation Club UK’s James McCarthy dug into what Kuusisto had learnt in his first 12 months at the airline.

So close to Russia

Finland is in a unique geographical position, sharing a border with Russia but now effectively what Kuusisto referred to as “an island,” following the closure of Russian airspace due to its ongoing military aggression in Ukraine.

Although the invasion predated his time at Finnair, Kuusisto discussed the initial effect it had had on the airline. “We were just bouncing back after the pandemic and preparing to relaunch the pre-Covid services that provided the shortest connections between Europe and Asia,” he told the audience. “We were looking forward to near 2019 levels of demand but then faced another unforeseen existential crisis.”

The airline’s priority was to take immediate action to secure the safety of employees and crew and many of its aircraft were grounded immediately. “Many of our long-haul flights towards Asia leave during the evening,” Kuusisto explained, “and in a very short period of time, the decision was made to cancel all those flights. Only thereafter could we start to evaluate the effect of the so-called New World Order and plan to reconstruct the airline’s strategy.”

Many airline leaders are pessimistic about the possibility of Russian airspace opening in the near to medium-term. When pressed on the matter, Kuusisto described himself as “a realist, not a pessimist,” pointing out that “there was speculation about the opening of Russian airspace when the so-called Ukrainian peace process was first discussed but, unfortunately, very little has happened since.”

“My very decisive guidance to my organisation has been to ensure that our strategy, commercial approach and network design must contribute value, even if Russian airspace remains closed. If it opens, then it is a positive booster for our current business model and strategy – but one needs to be very realistic.”

However, he went on to explain that Finnair would be able to react very quickly if overflight rights are restored and the most immediate benefit would be that the airline could return to providing 24-hour rotations, flying its A350s from Helsinki to Asia.

Financial success

Finnair now operates 80 aircraft to around 100 destinations worldwide. (All via Finnair unless stated)

Ever the pragmatist, Kuusisto sees that reset as a way to achieve a more balanced network. “While Asia is still extremely important for us, at the same time we have become a much more important operator on the North Atlantic traffic routes.”

The strategy seems to have worked, with Kuusisto reporting that Finnair’s 2023 financial figures were very good. “In fairness it was pretty much a good year for all companies,” he accepted. “There was a lot of backlog after the pandemic with ticket prices and demand both extremely high but, at the same time, we feel that we did a very solid job in 2024, even though the ticket prices and yields started to normalise. So, we have two solid, robust fiscal years behind us.”

“The first quarter results for 2025 are a bit of a weak start,” he admitted, “but in many ways that was expected and hampered by prolonged industrial action. All in all, I would say that Finnair is back in the game and back to cruising altitude.”

How has Finnair achieved this turnaround, weathering the storm from what could have been a tumultuous commercial disaster to a healthy ‘new’ business? “It is all about attitude, agility, willingness and what we call in Finnish ‘sisu’ – I guess the best translation is ‘determination.’ The Finnair force really has ‘sisu,’” Kuusisto proudly told the audience.

However, the ongoing strike for better wages by members of the Finnish Transport Pilots’ Association (SLL), which began in the autumn of 2024, continues with action, including a standby ban. The airline has not ruled out furloughing staff as a result of the industrial action and Kuusisto confirmed that it has had to cut some 230 flights from its summer schedule as a direct result of the strikes.

Atlantic reliance

The longhaul fleet is made up of Airbus A330s and A350s (illustrated), although the latter is also used on the Helsinki to London route.

The growing reliance on North Atlantic traffic could be subject to turbulence in the months ahead, with volatility in the financial markets, following uncertainty over tariffs and reports of a growing unwillingness among Europeans to travel to the US in response to concerns over various Trump administration policies. However, at the time of speaking, Kuusisto said Finnair had not yet seen a drop-off in bookings. “It is too early to tell and we now follow the trend on a weekly basis but, so far, we have not witnessed a big shift in either consumer behaviour or demand.”

“We are continuing our investment in the transatlantic market,” he continued, “and for the forthcoming summer season we will be flying eleven weekly frequencies from Helsinki to Dallas, for instance. Unless something extraordinary happens we will continue to invest in the US market.”

Fleet renewal

A dozen ATR 72s are among the few non-Airbus aircraft in the fleet.

In 2025, Finnair operates a predominantly Airbus fleet of 80 aircraft. This includes A319s, A320s, A321s, A330s and A350s but its regional operations are supplemented by 12 ATR 72-500s and 12 Embraer E190s. In a February earnings call, the airline communicated the fact that it was about to begin evaluating options to replace 15 of its narrowbody Airbus types.

“Those aircraft are coming to the end of their life cycle, with an average age of 23 years,” confirmed Kuusisto. “So, during this calendar year, we need to make at least preliminary decisions about how we approach this renewal. Due diligence work is being conducted now and it all starts with our network design team. I asked them for an optimal network for Finnair to fly in the future to support both our core strategy and commercial strategy. Once we have that it in place, we will select the most suitable aircraft to fly that network.”

Sustainability vs competitiveness

Finnair's CEO cited concerns over the availability of useful levels of sustainable aviation fuel by the end of the decade.

A newer generation of aircraft will also help Finnair meet its sustainability targets. However, Kuusisto referred to the attitude towards sustainability as “perhaps my biggest surprise since joining the airline.”

“It is a complicated topic because aviation companies should obviously do their fair share when it comes to fighting the climate crisis,” he elaborated. “But at the same time, we need to be humble and realistic about what we can do with what is available in our toolbox. The affordability and availability of sustainable aviation fuel will most likely become a bottleneck towards the end of this decade and we need to understand that fitting solar panels on top of our offices and switching to LED bulbs is not going to help if we are not capable of solving the fuel issue.”

That said, he confirmed that Finnair remained committed to its Science-Based Targets Initiative validated CO2 reduction targets, which call for a 34.5% reduction in CO2 intensity by the end of 2033. “It's a very ambitious target,” he admitted, “and we most likely do not have all the tools available yet, so we need to maintain the technological developments. Above all, we need to accept that the development curve will not be linear and some type of revolutionary technologies will need to emerge.”

Kuusisto also urged against overregulation, saying “we need to secure the connectivity and competitiveness of the European carriers. For Finland – which is a small country with just 5.6m citizens – to remain competitive and relevant we need reliable and cost-effective connections to Europe.

The fact that the airline’s CEO was so hands-on with the running of the operation was evident when he explained how he makes a point of sitting in on the quarterly safety management and safety culture calls. “The previous CEOs had not done this,” he revealed, “but, for me, it is a window into the attitude and the pulse of the organisation. I find it heartwarming to hear the level of details and diligence our team is putting into the step-by-step process of flight safety. I guess, in an airline company, the biggest threat is actually when you have been so good previously that you become complacent – but the Finnair team is always pushing for better, safer performance.

“On that theme, I feel that regulators and airlines should only stipulate processes and procedures that are fit for purpose – and that operators need to not just stick with them but work towards improving them and creating an extremely robust management system. Meanwhile, we should also get rid of all the non-necessary bureaucracy.”

Recipe for success

Kuusisto described his workforce as the airline's biggest asset.

In recent years, Finnair has been recognised as the ‘Best Airline’ in Northern Europe by World Airline Awards for the 14th time and also won ‘Best Cabin Crew’ in Northern Europe in 2023. “There is something magical that my colleagues do in the cabin during the flight,” Kuusisto proudly told the audience. That is pretty much the heart of the service and operation that we provide for our customers. Of course, I am aware that we need to become better when it comes to the digital experience, as well as the before- and after-flight experiences – but when we really dive into the core product, it's all about the reliability and punctuality of our service and excellency of our cabin crew.”

Kuusisto sees AI as the key to future successes. “Our operations must become more intelligent and be backed up with both data and AI,” he explained. “But, at the same time, I believe that we have a lot of potential when it comes to improving the user interface towards our customers and passengers. Our mobile app will be key to our digital development, and not only for the core parts of passenger travel. We are looking at what else we could bring into the app, especially for our Finnair Plus loyalty scheme members. During the years to come, you will see great things coming up through our digital pipeline.”

At present, Finnair is operating the A350 from Helsinki to London, but Kuusisto was asked whether any thought had been given to a Stockholm to London City route, using one of Finnair’s narrowbody types. With 1.3m passengers flying between the two cities annually, the Finnair CEO agreed that it was an avenue that was being explored.

He also acknowledged that the volatile nature of geopolitics presented his airline with a mix of both threats and opportunities. “We are still feeling the ‘positive’ after-effects of the pandemic,” he explained. “Those with the available funds are still prioritising travel – particularly in the premium leisure travel market. We are continuously developing our premium offering and network and we believe that we could be the real champion in the Nordics. For instance, this summer we are offering 54 weekly frequencies from Finland to Norway and it is important to understand the attractiveness of the Nordic region during the summertime – it is not all about Lapland and Santa Claus and winter snow – there are exotic places to visit during the summertime.”

Staying humble

From its base at Helsinki Airport, Finnair now reached around 100 destinations worldwide.

In an era where airlines are increasingly merging to improve their competitive dynamics, Kuusisto was asked whether this was on the cards at Finnair – which is already part of the Oneworld Alliance.

“My core principles for Finnair are based on two things,” he elaborated. “Firstly, we have to assume that Russian airspace will remain closed for the foreseeable future and, secondly, we need to develop a sustainable standalone company. That said, we get a huge benefit from being a member of the alliance, but we need to stay extremely humble. At best we are a medium-sized airline company with around 100 destinations and a fleet of 80 aircraft but, through our partners and alliances, we can actually reach 1,000 destinations globally.”

“Over my first 12 months, I've learned that Finnair is actually a very valued Oneworld member and partner. Even though we are not the biggest in terms of fleet size or network size, we definitely punch above our weight when it comes to being a value creator in the ecosystem.”

Kuusisto says he has learnt a lot during his first year at the helm of Finland’s flag carrier, but none of it came as a surprise. “There is a sense of pride associated with this brand; you can almost touch it,” he said with a beaming smile. “To some extent it is a calling to be part of an airline, at least in Finland. Finnair has come through difficult times, but I have an extremely resilient and agile group of magnificent colleagues and I am really looking forward to taking this company to the next chapter.”",https://www.aerosociety.com/media/26467/blog-finnair_a350_plane_from_behind_2-wheel_stoppers_removed.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 06:57:18.073368

SAF indexes need to be tailored to the unique cost profiles of diverse production technologies, delivering the right information required to scale the SAF industry for aviation goal of net zero by 2050.

“Creating transparent and technology-specific SAF price benchmarks is critical to scaling sustainable aviation fuel markets""

Share

For more than half a century, the aviation industry has relied on traditional price reporting services to manage exposure to price risks in the fossil jet fuel market. But the SAF revolution demands a new approach. Unlike traditional fuels, SAF can be produced from a wide variety of certified technologies, each with distinct feedstocks, costs, CO2 reduction capabilities and production scalability – and, at the end, producing similar drop-in aviation fuels. A one-size-fits-all SAF index isn’t fungible in this complex emerging market.

ATOBA recognises that the immediate hurdle to overcome is unlocking investment and building confidence in bankable long-term offtake agreements for new production facilities. A key enabler to overcoming this challenge is bringing transparency and a level playing field to the industry through the creation of new SAF price indexes, developed by General Index. Each index will be designed to reflect the unique cost profile of the diverse SAF technologies and aggregated to create a benchmark that aligns with regulatory frameworks, regional nuances and market needs.

Neil Bradford, CEO & Founder, General Index, said: “Creating transparent and technology-specific SAF price benchmarks is critical to scaling sustainable aviation fuel markets. We’re already a benchmark partner to the European Commission for the official 2024 Aviation Fuels Reference Prices for ReFuelEU Aviation. Now, by partnering with ATOBA Energy, we’re helping to build the foundational infrastructure needed to attract investment, support offtake agreements, and accelerate the aviation industry’s transition to net zero.”

Arnaud Namer, CEO & Co-Founder ATOBA Energy, said: “Unlocking investment in sustainable aviation fuel starts with transparency, market confidence, and trusted pricing tools. That’s why we’re proud to partner with General Index to introduce a new generation of SAF price benchmarks tailored to the real cost structures of emerging SAF technologies. These benchmarks are critical to ensuring SAF is competitively priced for airlines—an advantage we deliver thanks to our diversified portfolio of best-in-class SAF producers and long-term offtake aggregation strategy.”

Bayer Carbon Program In Bayer’s case, the Bayer Carbon Program pays farmers for sustainable practices they are already using on their own farm, says Alyssa Cho, Bayer sustainable agriculture field team lead.
Bayer uses these farmer practices to sell carbon credits to companies that wish to offset their carbon emissions.
“We've also added a nitrogen reduction offer that pays an additional $4 per acre.” The Bayer Carbon Program contract is for five years.","Last summer, Robert Bonnie attended Farmfest, a farm show annually held near Morgan, Minn. So, what was the main thing on the mind of Minnesota corn growers that day?

“Carbon intensity,” says Bonnie, the former USDA undersecretary for farm production and conservation during the Biden administration.

Bonnie, who addressed members of the North American Agricultural Journalists at their late April meeting, was struck by how much those farmers knew about the CI system that’s part of the Section 45Z tax credit of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. It tracks the carbon footprint of the biofuels supply chain that includes on-farm greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane.

Fewer emissions used to produce a bushel of corn or soybeans also translates into fewer emissions with the resulting produced biofuel. This translates into more tax credits a biofuels manufacturer can glean, says Mitchell Hora, a Washington, Iowa, farmer and founder and CEO of the software company Continuum Ag.

These tax credits could spur potential shareable payments — split between farmers, biofuel producers, grain merchandisers, third-party verifiers and many others — potentially worth over $100 per acre, Hora adds.

“Sustainability is not just about the environment, it's about new markets for agriculture,” Bonnie says. The farmers Bonnie talked to in Minnesota were interested in the market opportunities from reducing their carbon intensity scores.

“They're getting very smart about it,” he says.

Strong bipartisan congressional support has accompanied this interest, Bonnie adds. The Clean Fuel Production Credit, or 45Z, took effect Jan. 1.

So far, though, 45Z’s potential for farmers and other supply chain partners hasn’t materialized.

“Some 45Z draft guidance was issued by the Biden administration, but it didn’t provide clarity as to how farmers and their biofuel feedstock production will be accounted for,” Hora says. “We are still waiting for the critical details required to let 45Z get off the ground.”

He’s hopeful more 45Z movement will result in the coming months.

One good sign: The U.S. House Ways and Means Committee released the text of tax policy changes in May as part of the budget reconciliation process. It extends the 45Z tax credit through the end of 2031.

Situation revamp

This 45Z situation sums up the uncertainty revolving around carbon farming and sustainability programs these days.

“Some programs have settled in, some have gone away, and some have let off the gas a little bit,” says Eric Gibson, farm input and crop production sustainability analyst for Rabobank. “The wait-and-see approach is kind of what's on everyone's mind. There is still opportunity there, but tomorrow could be different than today. We're still waiting on final guidance on some of these programs.”

CARBON INTENSITY: These days, a carbon intensification system can track the carbon footprint of the biofuels supply chain from the farm through processing.

So far, most U.S. farmers have not flocked to these programs. An October 2024 report by McKinsey and Co. showed that among U.S. farmers:

Federal changes also have heightened uncertainty in this space. In mid-April, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins canceled the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities that the Biden administration established. She added that certain projects may continue if it is demonstrated that a significant amount of the federal funds awarded will go to farmers.

USDA also announced the overhauling of the Biden-era Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities initiative into the Advancing Markets for Producers initiative. Existing grant agreement reviews will be based on three of what it terms Farmer First policy priorities:

Such moves accompanied by personnel cuts to USDA and other federal agencies concern Bonnie.

“I worry about the erosion of not only U.S. leadership [in carbon and sustainability programs], but U.S. expertise in those agencies,” he says. “I worry that if we start pulling back, whether it's [USDA or] [the Environmental Protection Agency] or the Department of Energy or Department of Transportation or elsewhere in ways that influence those biofuel markets, that farmers are going to pay the price.”

Potential exists

The good news is that low-carbon markets for agricultural commodities — such as sustainable aviation fuel — aren’t going away. Many companies are working with farmers and others to reduce the carbon intensity of biofuels or to reduce their greenhouse gas footprint, Bonnie says.

“There's a huge role for technology and innovation in the private sector,” he adds.

Some programs in which farmers are paid for adopting new practices do add more risk, Gibson says.

“The big question comes into where their comfort level resides,” he adds.

Bayer Carbon Program

In Bayer’s case, the Bayer Carbon Program pays farmers for sustainable practices they are already using on their own farm, says Alyssa Cho, Bayer sustainable agriculture field team lead. Examples include reduced tillage or cover crops. Bayer uses these farmer practices to sell carbon credits to companies that wish to offset their carbon emissions.

“We pay $6 per practice per year back to the fall of 2019,” Cho says. “We've also added a nitrogen reduction offer that pays an additional $4 per acre.”

The Bayer Carbon Program contract is for five years. If a grower decides to sign up again at the end of the contract, Bayer offers another $6 per acre bonus.

“We do this to ensure that the grower knows what to expect and that they can have a guaranteed payment,” Cho says. “This also allows us to generate an asset for our customers downstream, and also allows us to help generate revenue that flows back to the farm for the grower.”

Either Bayer or the farmer can exit the program before the contract expires. “We know that things can change on the farm,” Cho says. “Acreage can switch hands, or a grower may decide they need to switch practices.”

The future

Despite the uncertainty in this space, Cho sees farmer interest holding firm in voluntary programs.

“What we're seeing from our customers is that they're still committed to greenhouse gas emission reductions,” she says. “Whatever is happening elsewhere, companies are signaling they're committed and continue to expand with us.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/bltf34fe03e5747b03b/68263ef1f7d8e474c528859b/0519T-1690A-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-05-20 06:57:31.949173

The aviation industry’s reliance on aviation turbine fuel makes it one of the most energy-intensive sectors in the world.","The aviation industry, a cornerstone of globalisation and modern transportation, relies heavily on one vital resource: aviation turbine fuel (ATF). Primarily derived from crude oil, ATF is a specialised kerosene refined to meet stringent quality and safety standards. With more than 100,000 flights taking off and landing around the world each day, understanding what fuels this immense operation—and where that fuel comes from—is critical.

What is Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF)?

Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), widely recognised as jet fuel, is an essential high-performance fuel for aircraft gas-turbine engines. The two primary types are Jet A and Jet A-1, with Jet A-1 being the global standard due to its exceptional cold-weather performance. These fuels, which range in colour from clear to straw-coloured, are rigorously tested to meet international standards set by leading organisations such as ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) and DEF STAN (the UK Ministry of Defence Standard). Formulated with advanced additives, jet fuel effectively prevents static discharge, corrosion, and microbial growth, ensuring safety and reliability even in the most demanding conditions at 35,000 feet.

How is ATF produced?

ATF is formed during the refining of crude oil. The process starts in petroleum refineries, where crude oil is distilled into various fractions. One of these fractions is kerosene, which is then hydrotreated to remove impurities like sulphur. The resulting jet fuel is blended to meet performance requirements.

Refineries all over the world customise their output to include ATF, particularly those located near major airports or transportation hubs. Transportation from refinery to wingtip involves pipelines, ships, railcars and fuel trucks. Major fuel hubs near airports contain large tank farms that store and distribute ATF via hydrant systems on the tarmac.

Global sources of ATF

The demand for ATF is concentrated in countries with large aviation sectors, and these nations often maintain robust refining capacities to ensure fuel availability. However, not all aviation hubs produce their jet fuel; many rely on imports. Some of the key players in global ATF production and distribution are:

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): The Future of Jet Fuel?

As the world shifts toward sustainability, the aviation industry is under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. Enter Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a bio-based alternative to traditional jet fuel. Made from feedstocks like used cooking oil, plant waste, and even captured CO₂, SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%.

Airlines like KLM, Lufthansa, and Delta have already begun incorporating SAF into their fuel mix. However, challenges such as high production costs, limited feedstock availability, and infrastructure compatibility hinder widespread adoption. Still, governments and industry players are investing heavily in SAF development, with ambitious targets set for 2030 and beyond.

The aviation industry’s reliance on aviation turbine fuel makes it one of the most energy-intensive sectors in the world. From the deserts of the Middle East to the refineries of the U.S. and the biofuel labs of Europe, the journey of ATF is complex and global. While traditional ATF continues to power the majority of aircraft, the rise of sustainable aviation fuels points to a cleaner, greener future. Ultimately, what fuels aviation is more than just kerosene — it’s a vast web of global supply chains, innovation, and a shared commitment to keeping the world connected through flight.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ng4qu0/article69593615.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-05-06T220643Z_1704911303_RC2HICAMY4F3_RTRMADP_3_USA-NEWARK-AVIATION.JPG,N,,2025-05-20 06:57:40.334900

Will Reynolds sign Iowa pipeline bill?

CO2 is a byproduct of ethanol production. Capturing the CO2 and burying it underground improves the carbon index score of the ethanol, qualifying it for more products such as sustainable aviation fuel.

Rep. Steven Holt from Denison has championed restricting carbon capture pipelines. He says it ultimately comes down to property rights.

Monte Shaw is the executive director of the Iowa Renewable Energy Association. He said that this bill could make it harder for pipeline companies that aren't using eminent domain. Shaw said the SIRE ethanol plant in Council Bluffs, which has 100% voluntary participation from landowners, could also be limited by this bill.

Sherri Webb's family owns land in the path of the proposed Summit pipeline: “The idea that they want to put a pipeline through that land which would cause more erosion than anything — especially after decades of no-till — just really bothers me.”

BROADCAST TRANSCRIPT:

I'm Southwest Iowa neighborhood reporter Katrina Markel.

Property rights, the ethanol market, and carbon capture pipelines are pressing issues for Iowa landowners, and they don’t all agree.

Now neighbors wait to see if the governor will sign a bill that would restrict the use of carbon capture pipelines by the ethanol industry.

What’s interesting here is that the bill isn’t explicitly about banning eminent domain.

It’s a multi-faceted bill. A key feature: re-defining what counts as a common carrier pipeline — or a pipeline with a public use.

Rep. Steven Holt from Denison has championed restricting carbon capture pipelines.

Katrina Markel: “Why was it important to you?”

Holt: “Well, number one I love the constitution. I think the protections in the constitution are of extreme importance. George Washington said, many years ago, that freedom and property rights are inseparable.”

The bill also sets a high bar for insurance requirements for the pipelines.

Monte Shaw, the executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, says it would make the pipelines prohibitively expensive: “It’s a really crappy bill.”

Shaw says landowners who favor the pipelines see the potential for boosting corn ethanol markets.

“I also grew up in Shenandoah during the 1980s farm crisis and I remember how horrible that was, so I get pretty passionate when we have markets, that could drive corn prices for the next 30 years, within our grasp,” Shaw said.

“My sisters and my brother and I have talked about this over and over, and it’s not the money,” said Sherri Webb.

Her family owns land in the planned path of the Summit pipeline. She has been a vocal opponent.

Webb: “The idea that they want to put a pipeline through that land which would cause more erosion than anything — especially after decades of no-till — just really bothers me.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ae5923/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb8%2Fae%2F4744be7249d2b2a33e802641a497%2Fposter-image-5.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 22:56:08.381984

Nature-based boost – The UN Development Programme (UNDP) in the Philippines and Canada have launched the NatureNest Accelerator, a six-month programme aimed at supporting ten local enterprises to scale nature-based solutions (NbS) that promote climate resilience and ecosystem protection. NatureNest is expected to provide capacity building in business operations, climate resilience, and gender equality, alongside one-on-one mentoring to improve access to financing. Filipino government agencies, including the Department of Finance, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, expressed support for the programme. Applications are open until Jun. 13.

Defining the roadmap – The Institute for Climate and Society Brazil and Nature4Climate held a roundtable Monday for climate journalists to underscore the importance of reaching the $1.3 trillion climate finance goal by 2035 established in Baku. The Baku-Belem Roadmap, which is developed by both the Azerbaijan and Brazilian COP presidencies, sets a vision and direction for COP30 in Belem, said Professor Josue Tanaka of the Grantham Research Institute. That vision will not only include novel ways to reach that target, but also define ways to more efficiently distribute existing dollars to developing nations, panellists said.

Nuclear new-build – The construction of two new nuclear power plants in the Netherlands will cost an estimated €20-30 bln, said climate and energy minister Sophie Hermans on Friday. This is the government’s first cost estimate. It is based on technical feasibility studies by EDF and Westinghouse, the two potential builders. Cost estimates will become more accurate once designs and locations are selected, said the minister. Overall however, the price tag corresponds to experiences in other European countries, she noted. The first plant is expected to be ready at the end of the 2030s at the earliest.

SAF in Rotterdam – Swiss start-up Metafuels plans to open its first commercial-scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) factory in the Port of Rotterdam, according to TNW. The facility will be built in collaboration with liquid energy storage provider Evos. Metafuels’ “aerobrew” technology converts renewable methanol into jet fuel, claiming up to 90% lower life cycle emissions than conventional jet fuel. Its factory will be able to process both biomethanol (from biowaste) and e-methanol (from renewable hydrogen and captured CO2). Metafuels expects both its Dutch plant and a Danish facility to start producing fuel for commercial use from 2028.

Microbial impact – Equinor has partnered with the University of Manchester to study how microbes in underground storage sites could impact carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, responding to concerns that their response to CO2 injection remains poorly understood. While some microbial responses could provide CO2 storage benefits, others could possibly lead to methane production, infrastructure corrosion, or loss of injectivity. The two-year project will collect samples from saline aquifers and oil production sites to study how the microbes respond to high concentrations of CO2. Microbial monitoring is not yet included in the monitoring strategy for CCS sites as required by the UK’s North Sea Transition Authority, but gaining a deeper understanding of how microbial communities respond to CO2 storage is seen as critical to the industry’s long-term success. Equinor’s Northern Lights CCS project in Norway is set to begin operating this year, and it’s also working alongside BP and TotalEnergies on the Northern Endurance Partnership CCS project in the UK’s Northeast.

CCS contract – Engineering consultancy Penspen has secured the contract to advance the development of the HyNet CO2 transportation pipeline at Liverpool Bay. The multi-million-pound deal signed with United Living Infrastructure Services will see Penspen deliver the detailed engineering design to develop both the pipelines and above-ground installations, to transport CO2 from local industrial emitters in Stanlow to the Liverpool Bay CCS facility via a network of new assets and repurposed infrastructure. Eni reached financial close for the HyNet CCS project last month, which will decarbonise heavy industry around Liverpool Bay through CCS and low-carbon hydrogen.

Dockside decarbonisation – DP World, a Dubai-based global logistics company, has extended its UK Carbon Inset programme through the end of 2025 after registering over 150,000 containers in the first three months. The initiative allows importers to claim 50kg of CO2e carbon credits per loaded container handled at DP World’s London Gateway and Southampton terminals, aiming to reduce Scope 3 emissions through the use of lower-carbon marine fuels by its subsidiary, Unifeeder, a European short-sea shipping and logistics provider.

ASIA PACIFIC

Record quarter – China installed 60 GW of new solar in the first quarter of 2025, analysis by Rystad Energy released Monday said, the highest ever recorded in a first quarter in the country’s history. Rooftop solar PV accounted for 60% of that total. The installations were the result of entities rushing to meet policy deadlines set by the National Energy Administration’s new guidelines which come into effect in May, the firm said. The rules encourage rooftop solar as a way to ease grid congestion issues, improve grid stability, and cut reliance on centralised power plants. Rystad predicts the surge in rooftop solar will continue, totalling 130 GW in 2025.

Disclosure urged – Kepco, South Korea’s largest electricity utility, has been accused of failing to disclose material climate-related risks in its $11 bln global medium-term note programme listed on the Singapore Exchange, with a whistleblower complaint filed Monday by non-profit Solutions for Our Climate (SFOC). The power company in the bond filings did not reveal its continued reliance on coal-fired power and financial exposure to LNG price volatility, SFOC said in a statement. Also, labelling hydrogen and ammonia fuel blends as “carbon-free” could mislead stakeholders, the statement said.

Pitch your ideas – Japan’s environment ministry is calling for feasibility study proposals for emissions reduction projects with synergy under the bilateral Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), according to a notice published Monday. The ministry said three feasibility study projects, each with costs of no more than JPY 20 mln ($138,142), will be selected. The Japanese government is also seeking JCM project proposals that can provide benefits beyond emissions reductions.

Speeding up – Nepal has submitted its third NDC to the UN, vowing – as previously reported by Carbon Pulse – to reach net zero emissions in 2045, five years earlier than its former target. The plan also lists a number of other climate commitments, most of which rely on financial contributions from abroad.

Reviving fallow lands – Indian portfolio company Hexa Climate has partnered with Asvata, a carbon credit venture of the RPG Group, to launch an afforestation project in the state of West Bengal, the partners told Carbon Pulse in an email. Under the project, around 500,000 trees will be planted to revive fallow land into forest ecosystems, thereby generating 375,000 credits over the next 20 years. The partners aim to register the project under carbon standard Verra, with plans of scaling up to 1.5 mln trees, they added.

Subsidy showdown – US House Republicans are preparing to modify their party-line budget reconciliation bill this week, potentially including a stronger rollback of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) clean energy tax credits, before attempting to pass it through the lower chamber, E&E News reported. The package, advanced by the House Budget Committee on May 18, includes provisions to cut climate-related grants, repeal parts of the IRA, and sell public lands.

Case dismissed – A Pennsylvania judge has dismissed a climate lawsuit brought by Bucks County against six major oil and gas companies and the American Petroleum Institute. The case alleged that the companies violated state consumer protection laws by misleading the public about the environmental risks of fossil fuel use. The judge found that the county’s claims could not be raised in state court. The decision marks at least the fifth dismissal of similar climate liability suits within the past year. (E&E News)

Electrolyser expansion – Electric Hydrogen, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of high-power electrolyser systems, announced that Infinium, a Texas-based producer of commercial eFuels, will use its 100 MW HYPRPlant electrolyser at Project Roadrunner, a large-scale eFuels facility in Pecos, Texas. The system is designed to lower total installed hydrogen project costs by up to 60% and aims to support the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), eDiesel, and eNaphtha from CO2, power, and water. The project, expected to be the world’s largest eFuels facility when it begins operations in 2027, is backed by Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst.

Cash to cut carbon – Scotiabank has opened applications for the fifth edition of its Climate Action Research Fund (CARF), which seeks to provide grants ranging from C$25,000 to C$100,000 ($17,900-71,700) to registered charities and non-profit organisations conducting research to support the transition to a lower-carbon economy. The fund, which allocates approximately C$1 mln annually over 10 years, aims to stimulate research on topics including decarbonisation pathways, carbon sinks, climate finance mechanisms, and regulatory changes. Projects must be novel, have clearly defined deliverables and timelines, and show potential to inform decarbonisation or financial institution efforts. Applications are due by May 22.

I’ll take that – Around six in 10 Americans view more stringent environmental laws and regulations to be worth the cost, but opinions vary significantly by party and region, according to a 2023-24 survey conducted by think tank Pew Research Center. The survey, which included some 36,900 participants, found that Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents think such laws are worth the cost (82%), while Republicans and GOP leaners opined that they cost too many jobs and hurt the economy (59%). Minnesota and Washington, DC showed the broadest support for stricter environmental regulations, followed by 28 other states. The think tank said that views diverged in 20 other states, while a majority of adults in Wyoming did not support the laws.

Wood you believe it – The Government of Guyana, in collaboration with the Global Green Growth Institute — an intergovernmental green finance organisation — and with funding from the UK’s Partnering for Accelerated Climate Transitions programme, recently launched a project to strengthen Guyana’s Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) systems. The initiative aims to improve GHG emissions reporting, sustainable forest management, and access to climate finance, with support from the Guyana Forestry Commission. The project seeks to expand data collection across land use and forestry sectors, including mangroves, and is expected to enhance reporting capacity and potentially unlock up to £46 mln in carbon financing. The project is scheduled to run until Dec. 2026.

Marine CDR – Registry Puro.earth’s first ocean-based carbon removal methodology approved by its advisory board has evolved from OSB (ocean stored biomass) to MACS (marine alkalinity and carbon storage). In an update on LinkedIn, Puro wrote the durability estimate has been revised from 1,000+ to 200+ years, that ongoing field trials are key to gathering real-world data and validating methodology assumptions, and that continued R&D efforts are focused on enhancing environmental integrity, MRV, and credibility. More on their blog.

Mammoth troubles – Swiss direct air capture firm Climeworks has acknowledged delays in ramping up its Mammoth plant in Iceland, which began operating in 2024. The facility, designed to remove 36,000 tonnes of CO₂ annually, captured just 750 tonnes in its first 10 months, with net removals of only 105 tonnes, The Guardian reported. The company cited mechanical issues and said upgrades are underway. Climeworks also recently announced job cuts and uncertainty around its US-based Project Cypress amid shifting policy signals.",https://carbon-pulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favicon.png,N,,2025-05-19 22:56:23.801657
