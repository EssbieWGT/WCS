The expansion will see Neste supply SAF to three more major U.S. airports, including George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), and Dulles International Airport (IAD). This move reinforces United’s ongoing efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and accelerate the aviation industry’s transition to greener fuel alternatives.

New Airports Join United’s SAF Network

United Airlines, which has been actively involved in the promotion and adoption of sustainable aviation practices, has expanded its SAF supply to these additional airports as part of its sustainability strategy. As of July 2025, Neste began supplying SAF at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport, marking a milestone in the airline’s effort to reduce carbon emissions. The SAF deliveries at IAH are scheduled to continue through October 2025.

In September 2025, the collaboration between United and Neste expanded to include both Newark Liberty and Dulles International airports. SAF deliveries will run through the remainder of the year, with plans to continue in the future. By adding these three major airports to the network, United Airlines is taking a further step toward its ambitious goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The Importance of SAF in Sustainable Aviation

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a key component in reducing the aviation sector’s environmental impact. SAF is made from renewable sources, such as waste oils, agricultural residues, or non-food-based crops, and can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

By increasing the use of SAF at more airports, United Airlines is helping to set a new standard for eco-friendly air travel. SAF also plays a crucial role in improving local air quality around airports by reducing the harmful emissions associated with fossil fuels. As more airports adopt SAF, it not only helps the airline meet its sustainability targets but also supports the global goal of lowering carbon emissions in the aviation industry.

United Airlines has been at the forefront of integrating SAF into its operations. Previously, the airline has worked with Neste to provide SAF at other airports, including Chicago O’Hare International and San Francisco International Airport. United’s broader commitment to SAF, seen in this new expansion, is part of its strategic vision to reduce the aviation industry’s reliance on traditional jet fuels.

Benefits for United Airlines and Its Passengers

For United Airlines, expanding SAF usage is not only a step towards sustainability but also a way to address the increasing demand for eco-friendly travel options. Passengers are becoming more conscious of the environmental impact of their travel decisions, and this move by United to provide SAF at more airports signals a commitment to offering greener alternatives.

Brett Hart, President of United Airlines, has emphasized that collaboration is key to accelerating the shift towards SAF. The airline’s partnership with Neste is crucial in making SAF more widely available. Hart also acknowledged the importance of government support, particularly through policies such as SAF tax credits, which have enabled easier access to these sustainable fuel options. United’s use of SAF at its expanded airports will provide more sustainable flight options to passengers, helping the airline meet its carbon reduction goals.

Neste’s Role in Expanding SAF Supply

Neste’s role in providing SAF to United Airlines is critical to the growth of the sustainable aviation fuel industry. Neste has committed to scaling up the production of SAF, with plans to increase its global production capacity. By supplying SAF to key airports in the U.S., Neste is helping pave the way for widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuel, making it more accessible to a broader range of airlines.

Neste’s SAF is produced from renewable feedstocks, and the company’s extensive network ensures that airlines like United can efficiently access SAF at key airports. The expansion of SAF availability at major hubs like Houston, Newark, and Dulles is a key milestone in the evolution of green aviation, as it signals that SAF is becoming a viable alternative for fueling commercial flights on a larger scale.

The Bigger Picture: A Shift Toward Sustainable Aviation

The aviation industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint as part of the global effort to combat climate change. Aviation accounts for a significant portion of global emissions, and switching to SAF is one of the most effective ways to reduce these emissions without requiring major changes to existing aircraft or airport infrastructure.

United’s partnership with Neste is part of a broader trend in the aviation industry, where many airlines are seeking to integrate SAF into their operations. As governments continue to support the adoption of SAF through tax incentives and regulatory frameworks, the production and distribution of sustainable aviation fuel will continue to grow, making it more affordable and accessible for airlines worldwide.

What’s Next for United Airlines and SAF

Looking ahead, United Airlines plans to further expand its SAF usage across more airports in the coming years. The airline has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050, with SAF playing a pivotal role in meeting these targets. United also aims to increase the percentage of its fleet powered by SAF, helping to lead the way in aviation sustainability.

For passengers, the expansion of SAF at key airports like Houston, Newark, and Dulles ensures that they can travel with a more eco-conscious airline. The move reflects a growing demand for sustainable travel options and shows that airlines are actively responding to the environmental concerns of modern travelers.

Conclusion

The expansion of SAF delivery to three more major U.S. airports is a positive step forward for United Airlines and the aviation industry as a whole. By continuing its partnership with Neste, United is not only advancing its sustainability goals but also helping to set the standard for greener air travel. With SAF reducing emissions and improving local air quality, this initiative represents a crucial part of the aviation industry’s future — one that’s more sustainable and environmentally friendly.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/images-of-united-airlines-planes-at-hous_JmsVKy1TTpWCyL5jYCd6Lg_Shd9NlXXTxOWuNU8MIRdZA.jpeg,N,,2025-10-29 17:56:20.546352

The agency’s data reveal that national biofuel production capacity increased by just 3% from the start of 2024 to early 2025, primarily due to a marked deceleration in the renewable diesel segment and increased sector rationalisation.

Renewable diesel and other biofuels—including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable naphtha, and renewable propane—grew only 391 million gallons per year (gal/y). This is less than one-third the annual growth levels seen in 2022 and 2023. In 2024, only two significant capacity additions entered service, both in California: Phillips 66 completed its conversion of the Rodeo refinery exclusively to biofuels, now rated at 767 million gal/y (up from 180 million gal/y the year before), making it the country’s second-largest facility behind Diamond Green Diesel’s 982-million-gal/y plant in Norco, Louisiana. The new Renewable Fuels LLC plant in Bakersfield also came online with 138 million gal/y of capacity.

However, these gains were partially offset by the closure of four facilities: Monroe Energy and Chevron discontinued renewable diesel co-processing at plants in Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, respectively, while Vertex Energy and Jaxon Energy shut down plants in Alabama and Mississippi, respectively. These shutdowns reflect tighter margins for biofuels and robust profitability for petroleum refining, which discouraged new investments for the coming years.

Meanwhile, the SAF segment is gaining momentum. Phillips 66’s Rodeo plant can now shift 150 million gal/y of renewable diesel to SAF, while Diamond Green Diesel can reallocate about 235 million gal/y. This refocus aligns with growing demand for low-carbon aviation fuels.

Biodiesel capacity actually fell, with eight plants closing in 2024 due to unfavourable margins, reducing output by roughly 100 million gal/y.

Conversely, U.S. fuel ethanol production capacity increased more in 2024 than in prior years, now comprising 73% of the nation’s total biofuel capacity (nearly 18.5 billion gal/y). Most ethanol production remains centred in the Midwest, with the rise in capacity primarily supporting growing export demand rather than increased domestic use.

Regions such as the PJM Interconnection zone are showing signs of stress, and utilities and grid-operators are already talking about disconnecting large data-center loads during emergencies and seeing sharp wholesale price spikes.

Earlier this year, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association published a report, A Reliable Grid for an Electric Future, that projects that national electricity demand will rise more than 50% by 2050. Some industry observers worry utilities are ill-equipped to handle such fast load growth. Data centers, transportation electrification and manufacturing operations remain at risk from power disruptions. At the same time, much of the US’ transmission and distribution network is decades old. NEMA says those factors make modernization a near-term necessity rather than a long-term aspiration.

The report provided useful information that set the stage for NEMA and the GridWise Alliance’s recent Congressional Grid Innovation Expo, where the industry had a chance to discuss ongoing projects and technological developments that enhance grid reliability. ABB, INDT and other GridWise Alliance members revealed products that suggest the future of grid reliability will succeed based on how well the power system implements data management and predictive control systems. The products support a lofty goal: To extend equipment life and prevent faults and failures before breakdowns happen.

Demand Growth and System Stress

Electricity use in the United States is climbing at the fastest rate in a generation. Data centers alone are expected to increase their consumption by 300% over the next decade, according to NEMA’s analysis. Artificial intelligence workloads generate one-quarter of the total growth in this market. The current requirement for individual facilities exceeds 100 megawatts, which creates excessive pressure on nearby substations and transmission lines.

ABB engineers believe they have solved this problem through the implementation of artificial intelligence technology that now operates within their grid monitoring and fault prediction systems. One system they developed in 2018 uses real-time operational data analysis to detect minor voltage and current irregularities which typically signal upcoming faults. The model achieves 95% confidence in failure precursor detection, which enables utilities to detect and solve potential issues before they cause service disruptions. ABB says it has demonstrated through its European operations that big organizations can achieve major reliability enhancements by implementing data collection and analytics integration at scale.

Another major factor that creates new market demand stems from transportation electrification. NEMA projects that power consumption from electric vehicle charging will grow nearly 9000 percent by mid-century. Roughly 55 million light-duty electric vehicles are expected on US roads by 2035. These vehicles will create new patterns of customer demand by generating more traffic during evening and nighttime hours while creating big consumption zones near charging stations. This requires scheduling charging operations according to renewable power availability and storage capacity to achieve stability.

The process of building and industrial electrification creates an additional level of complexity. The transition to electric heat pumps and induction processes and other non-combustion systems results in higher total energy consumption and produces more concentrated peak demand periods. Installation of rooftop solar systems and behind-the-meter batteries can lead to intermittent backflow that standard distribution networks aren’t designed to handle.

Meanwhile, the regional distribution of growth is uneven. PJM and ERCOT experience fast-growing demand because of data center operations, but northeastern and western states face higher demand from electric vehicle charging and building power consumption. The installation of renewable energy systems will reach more than 50% in multiple regions during 2050, but their unpredictable power output needs stable power sources, including natural gas plants and nuclear reactors and extended storage systems.

Policy Framework and Supply Chain Readiness

Regulatory and supply chain conditions will determine whether modernization can keep pace with demand. NEMA has identified three key areas which need improvement to create immediate results: Permitting processes, tax and trade policy systems, and domestic manufacturing transparency systems.

The process of obtaining permits stands as the main obstacle blocking project development. The review process for transmission projects requires developers to wait multiple years before they can begin construction. NEMA supports federal-state process alignment for environmental requirements and grid-enhancing technology deployment to enhance power grid capacity through existing transmission corridors. The process of expansion would become faster through streamlined procedures which maintain proper monitoring.

The Inflation Reduction Act established financial incentives for grid development, but its unclear implementation procedures have restricted the number of organizations participating in the program. And the unpredictable nature of tariff policies, together with multiple electrical component exemptions, makes it difficult to procure goods and deters businesses from entering into extended contractual agreements.

The US–Mexico–Canada Agreement serves as the main framework for international trade component procurement. The right import policies will help maintain stable transformer and conductor supplies while protecting domestic manufacturing operations. The proposed LEAP Act expansion of technical apprenticeships through its programs would solve the existing skills shortage problem in manufacturing and field maintenance.

NEMA has attempted to address sourcing transparency through its Make It American BABA registry. The program maintains a database of American-made electrical products which fulfill both Buy America and Build America standards. The registry allows public agencies and their contractors to verify compliance status while discovering domestic suppliers through a new system which eliminates conventional certification procedures. The goal is to reduce delays in procurement, strengthen visibility into US manufacturing capacity and turn a regulatory mandate into a practical planning tool.

From Reactive to Preventive Operations

The reliability challenge increasingly depends on visibility. Many outages occur because utilities cannot detect early signs of mechanical or electrical stress. New approaches from ABB and IND Technology (INDT) demonstrate how complementary technologies can close that information gap.

ABB’s predictive fault management platform illustrates how data science can support operational decision-making. The system uses artificial intelligence to analyze real-time measurements of current, phase angle, and power quality. By comparing these data points with historical fault signatures, the software can identify patterns that precede equipment failure. When it detects conditions likely to worsen over the following days or weeks, operators receive alerts that allow targeted maintenance before a disruption occurs.

The value of ABB’s approach lies in its ability to integrate predictive analytics with existing grid management systems. When paired with automated switching and dispatch tools, it enables utilities to isolate faults more quickly and restore service faster. Utilities using this kind of analytics report measurable reductions in both outage frequency and duration, as well as lower maintenance costs from more focused field interventions.

INDT’s technology operates at a different level of the grid. Rather than analyzing system-wide electrical data, it focuses on the physical condition of transmission and distribution lines. The company’s sensor-based monitoring system detects defects such as cracked insulators or loosened fittings that often lead to faults. Sensors installed every few miles along transmission routes capture radio-frequency patterns that shift when small arcing events or mechanical vibrations occur. These changes are processed in the cloud, and the system generates precise geographic coordinates for maintenance crews.

The platform, originally developed and tested in Australia, improved network reliability by roughly 50 percent in long-term trials. It is now deployed across twelve of the twenty largest US utilities and recently completed a 16,000-mile installation in communities with limited previous grid investment. By turning inspection from a periodic task into a continuous process, INDT’s method lowers operational expenses while improving safety and service quality.

Using Existing Infrastructure More Efficiently

NEMA’s study identifies several technologies capable of unlocking substantial capacity increases. The use of advanced materials for reconductoring would enable the generation of 110 gigawatts of additional power. The installation of dynamic line ratings that adjust current limits based on temperature and wind conditions would lead to an additional 80 gigawatts of power generation. The combination of smart grid systems and advanced metering infrastructure would generate approximately 25 gigawatts of power through enhanced monitoring capabilities and better control of electricity usage.

Utilities have started using these methods in their current operations. The sensors from LineVision monitor conductor temperature and sag continuously to establish safe operating limits in real-time which results in a 10 to 20 percent increase in production capacity without requiring additional equipment. The GridWrap system provides mechanical strength to poles and towers through reinforcement which protects them from storms that cause capacity reductions. Organizations can extend their asset lifespan through these methods which delay their need for significant capital expenditures.

Storage and Flexible Resources

Energy storage is expanding faster than any other category of grid infrastructure. NEMA projects that installed storage capacity will grow more than tenfold over the next fifteen years. Short-duration batteries operate to stabilize wind and solar plant power output while long-duration systems function as backup power systems for prolonged power disruptions. Customers who install behind-the-meter systems gain control over their expenses while protecting themselves from power disruptions.

At the Expo, Siemens highlighted the Bronzeville Community Microgrid in Chicago, operated by ComEd. The system combines distributed solar generation, energy storage, and a Siemens controller that allows the microgrid to operate independently during wider grid outages. Similar configurations are being deployed at hospitals, universities, and industrial sites to improve local reliability and reduce peak demand.

Smarter Transformers and Digital Equipment

The power grid contains transformers which represent its most exposed system elements. Many units in service today are more than thirty years old and the supply of new ones is constrained by material and manufacturing limits. The integration of intelligence into these devices creates an efficient solution to boost system dependability until manufacturers can replace them entirely.

Attendees at the expo had an opportunity to see the Prolec-GE smart transformer platform, which contains sensors which track temperature data and vibration patterns and acoustic signals that indicate partial discharge occurrences. The on-board processors analyze data within their system to provide immediate responses when they detect any irregularities. The transformers establish secure connections with utility control systems through standard communication protocols which include MQTT and IEC 61850. The system operates as a bidirectional power flow system which enables distributed generation and microgrid operations.

The transformation allows transformers to take part in system management operations through active system participation. The system provides instant warning alerts about system deterioration while its control system preserves voltage stability through distributed resource power adjustments. Prolec research suggests that predictive maintenance techniques allow transformers to operate for extended periods while minimizing the requirement for new transformer units.

The industry has started to develop new methods which share similarities with these approaches. ABB achieves real-time coordination through direct analytics integration with its switchgear and substation systems. Hitachi Energy has initiated two manufacturing expansion projects in Virginia and Canada while it works to eliminate SF₆ gas from its equipment to achieve environmental sustainability. The modular microgrid systems from Schneider Electric enable faster project completion while providing uniform control systems. Lutron maintains its focus on building automation system development and lighting control solutions which enable users to monitor their energy usage.

Outlook

Electricity demand in the US is rising faster than the capacity of the generation and transmission system. Meeting that growth will depend on how effectively the country links technology, policy and domestic manufacturing.

Many of the necessary tools are already in place. Predictive analytics, sensor networks, grid-enhancing technologies, smart transformers, and advanced storage systems can all be deployed today to deliver measurable gains in reliability and resilience. NEMA’s Make It American BABA registry, along with supporting policy frameworks, strengthens the manufacturing foundation needed to scale those solutions.

Progress will hinge on three areas: streamlined permitting, consistent trade policy, and sustained investment in workforce development. Together, they form the conditions for modernization at the speed the economy now requires.

The grid that results from these efforts will operate with greater visibility and flexibility. It will rely on continuous data rather than scheduled inspection and on predictive maintenance rather than reactive repair. Success will depend on close coordination among utilities, manufacturers, and policymakers, but the essential technologies and methods are already proven. The next step is to apply them with the scope and urgency that a fully electrified economy demands.

The new agreement will increase the overall scale of the commercial relationship between the two companies to more than 1.3 GW across four Texas-based projects.

The latest PPAs cover Engie’s new 600 MW Swenson Ranch Solar project in Stonewall county, Texas. It is expected to be Engie’s single largest asset in its 11 GW portfolio of solar, wind and battery storage assets in North America, with planned investment reaching $900 million.

The 600 MW project will be operational in 2027, with Meta purchasing 100% of the site’s output to support its data center operations in the U.S.

Dave Carroll, CEO and Chief Renewables Officer at Engie North America, said:

“Our objective is to bring reliable, cost competitive power to the grid as rapidly as possible, and projects like Swenson demonstrate the importance of solar to meet the timely needs of our customers.”

Meta has set a target to reach net-zero emissions across its value chain by 2030. The company achieved its goal to meet 100% of its operational energy needs with renewable sources in 2020, and recently said that it anticipates adding 9.8 GW of renewable energy to local grids in the U.S. by the end of 2025.

The new agreement follows a renewable energy supply deal between the two companies earlier this year, in which Engie agreed to provide 200 MW of renewable energy and associated environmental attributes to Meta from its Anson 2 solar project, as well as a 260 MW deal announced last year.

""The maritime industry has a real need for renewable fuels that are immediately available and cost effective. Our Biocrude Upgrading processing technology can be delivered in modular form, offering savings from the point of installation through to refining and use.""

Plant and agricultural waste can be converted into lower carbon biocrude at the feedstock collection sites, which keeps transport costs low. Honeywell's new process technology enables biocrude to then be refined at major facilities to produce marine fuel, gasoline or SAF. This helps solve long-standing challenges with converting biocrudes into fuels with performance comparable to conventional fuel.

Biocrude Upgrading process technology can be delivered in the form of a prefabricated modular plant. As a result, Honeywell can help customers reduce risk and accelerate project timelines by simplifying site construction activity.

The introduction of Honeywell's Biocrude Upgrading process technology comes as shipping companies seek to reduce their carbon footprints due to customer demands and regulatory drivers. Since the 1960s, heavy fuel oil—residual products from the refining of gasoline, diesel, and kerosene—has been the principal energy source for the maritime sector and a main source of its roughly 3% contribution of global greenhouse gas emissions1.

Sustainable aviation fuel is a lower-carbon alternative produced from sources such as used cooking oils and fats, municipal waste, or from renewable energy sources.
The UK government currently imposes a ‘SAF mandate’ on the aviation industry that 2% of aviation fuel used in the UK must be SAF.","The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill is a government bill. It was introduced in the House of Commons on 14 May 2025 and completed its third reading on 15 October 2025. The bill was introduced in the House of Lords on 20 October 2025 and is due to receive its second reading on 20 November 2025. The Department for Transport has produced explanatory notes (ENs) for the bill.

The bill would introduce a revenue certainty mechanism to support the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK. It would do this by designating a counterparty (a company wholly owned by the government) to engage in contracts with SAF producers to guarantee the price of the sale of eligible SAF. To finance the revenue certainty mechanism the bill would introduce a levy on conventional aviation fuel suppliers.

Conventional aviation fuel is predominantly made from crude oil. Sustainable aviation fuel is a lower-carbon alternative produced from sources such as used cooking oils and fats, municipal waste, or from renewable energy sources. Development and production of SAF is capital intensive and global supply is limited.

The UK government currently imposes a ‘SAF mandate’ on the aviation industry that 2% of aviation fuel used in the UK must be SAF. This target is set to rise to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

Transport accounted for around 30% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, and aviation was the second largest contributor of that figure. The government has said that SAF is one of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, as SAF is a ‘drop-in fuel’ that does not require modifications to existing aircraft. The government has claimed the bill would support SAF production in the UK by providing revenue certainty and thereby reducing risk to investors in SAF production facilities.

It comes as plans to enlarge key hubs like Heathrow and Gatwick risk compromising the nation’s legally-binding net-zero commitments.

The Commons Environmental Audit Committee has warned that, without new safeguards, these expansions could push the UK beyond its carbon budgets.

The committee's report notes that current government policies are not sufficient to reduce carbon emissions from the aviation sector in line with statutory targets.

This is compounded by expectations of rising demand for air travel. further jeopardising national emission plans.

Air freight and economic targets

Following Labour's 2024 general election victory, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves approved new runways at both Heathrow and Gatwick.

For the government, the expansions represent vital components of its economic growth strategy.

The importance of Heathrow for UK trade is considerable, with more than 60% of the nation's air freight passing through the airport. This capacity is essential for connecting manufacturers to global markets.

“Heathrow is at the heart of the UK’s openness as a country,"" notes Reeves.

Reeves also points to Heathrow's ability to connect the UK to emerging markets and the fact it hosted around 15 million business travellers in 2023.

The committee has challenged this perspective, however, stating: ""The government has not demonstrated that the economic growth from airport expansion provides enough benefit to outweigh the negative climate and environmental impacts it will lead to.""

John McDonnell, Labour’s MP for Hayes and Harlington, previously wrote on social media that the Heathrow expansion was ""huge political economic and especially environmental mistake"" that could inflict ""irreparable scale of damage on the government"".

Sustainable aviation fuel production concerns

A significant part of the government's aviation decarbonisation plan relies on adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The committee has raised doubts about this strategy, highlighting that SAF is not yet being produced or used at a commercial scale.

This dependency on an emerging technology could pose a risk to achieving emission targets.

The challenge was underlined last year when Air New Zealand had to scrap its 2030 decarbonisation target, citing difficulties in securing a stable supply of SAF.

This brings into question whether the aviation industry can meet its decarbonisation promises without proven and scalable alternatives to conventional jet fuel.

Outdated policy and decarbonisation pressure

The planned expansions are set to begin before the government updates its national policy statement on airports, a document last released in 2018.

The committee argues this allows the government to avoid scrutiny and base decisions on a framework inconsistent with current climate objectives.

Toby Perkins, the Labour Chair of the committee, warns that meeting decarbonisation targets is already a considerable challenge.

""Expanding airport capacity is likely to make that task much harder,"" Toby says. ""Under the government's existing 'jet zero' strategy, expanding airport capacity is likely to put net zero at serious risk.""

Alethea Warrington, Head of Aviation at climate charity Possible, describes the committee's report as the ""final nail in the coffin"" for the government's case.

She says: ""The government's scrutiny committee has made it clearer than ever that airport growth is a bad option for Britain, and that the government simply doesn't have any economic evidence to justify the environmental devastation this would cause.""

In response, a spokesperson from the Department for Transport said: ""We have been clear that airport expansion will only go ahead if it aligns with our legal obligations on climate change, including net zero, and we will be seeking advice from the independent Climate Change Committee to inform the review.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/015db0eed64dbb49bcf15b3a340517fb:3bd63977912f8defd924cea7dec8e8b2/wagtailsource-heathrow-airport-height-1200-format-webp.webp.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 13:57:18.546572

The application details Phase 1 of the project, which includes the construction and operation of a production facility near the mouth of Isaacs Harbour, N.S.

It says production would require 60 truckloads of biomass per day and 586 cubic metres of fresh water per hour. Biomass is organic matter — for example, wood — that is used to generate energy.

According to the application, the biomass would be sourced locally following the European Union’s sustainability requirements, and the fresh water would come from two nearby lakes, Meadow Lake and Ocean Lake, through pipelines.

If the province grants environmental approval, construction could begin in 2028 and operations in 2031, the application says. The proponent expects the project to have a minimum 50-year lifespan, followed by decommissioning.

The site is on the coast in the community of Goldboro, N.S., on land that was previously owned by Pieridae Energy. That firm had proposed building a liquefied natural gas terminal, but after abandoning that plan it sold the land and all its permits and approvals to the new proponents.

The project was first imagined by Irish firm Simply Blue Group but was bought earlier this year by European energy giant Octopus Energy Generation. Octopus created a local entity, Nova Sustainable Fuels, to manage the project.

In its application to the province, Nova Sustainable Fuels says it wants to use water, biomass and electricity from wind turbines to generate hydrogen gas. The gas would then be converted into methanol and sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, a lower-emission alternative to conventional jet fuel.

The liquid fuels would then be shipped by boat to distributors and airlines.

Phase 2 of the project would include a wind farm and transmission line to feed electricity directly to the plant, but that is not included in the current environmental assessment.

The application for Phase 1 says the project will require an initial capital investment of $4 billion to $6 billion. Construction is expected to create 1,000 jobs and operations are expected to require 60 to 80 staff.

— Ron Kotrba, Editor and Publisher, Biobased Diesel Daily®

WARREN, MN, UNITED STATES, October 29, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Biobased Diesel Daily® (biobased-diesel.com), the leading biofuels news outlet specifically focused on the biodiesel, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and marine biofuel sectors of the global energy economy, is celebrating five years of successful operation since its launch.

Founded amid the changing biofuels landscape of 2020 by veteran industry writer and award-winning editor Ron Kotrba in order to better serve those who manufacture biofuels, develop projects and supply producers with vital equipment, goods and services to do so—as well as the broader market up and down the supply chain—Biobased Diesel Daily® was formed as a purpose-driven outlet covering biobased fuels specifically made for heavy-duty and hard-to-abate segments like trucking, construction, rail, heating, marine and aviation.

Now with more than 20 years of experience in the field as a writer, senior writer, editor, senior editor, editor-in-chief and publisher, Kotrba offers his take on what has made the Biobased Diesel® product line—including Biobased Diesel Daily® (biobased-diesel.com), Biobased Diesel™ Weekly and the Biobased Diesel® print magazine—such a success over the past five years.

“Five years ago, the energy markets were very different than they are today,” Kotrba says. “And the biofuels industries and markets within the larger energy sector have changed drastically too. But what hasn’t seemed to really change is how biofuels media moguls and their sprawling, bloated enterprises do their jobs and operate their businesses. After years covering these evolving markets, and years working within and learning how the biofuels news and magazine establishment operates—including how many of them truly do a disservice to their readers, advertisers and industries they purport to serve—I launched the Biobased Diesel® product line to show there is a better way.”

Shortly after debuting as a startup alternative in this competitive field, Biobased Diesel Daily®, Biobased Diesel™ Weekly and the Biobased Diesel® print journal grew in popularity and gained the trust of readers around the world, as well as dozens of advertising clients representing the largest companies in the space to smaller enterprises as well as various organizations and associations.

The once-alternative source of news, information and perspective for biodiesel, renewable diesel, SAF and marine biofuel is now a leading industry trade publication with nearly 5,000 articles published on Biobased Diesel Daily® since its introduction—despite the lack of an executive team, board members and sales, editorial, marketing and circulation staff.

“The success of the Biobased Diesel® line is precisely because I do not have overpaid, underwhelming executives, a commission-driven sales staff and an unmotivated or inattentive news crew on the payroll,” Kotrba says. “With the exception of an excellent contracted designer for the Biobased Diesel® print publication, I alone own, produce and operate this publication from start to finish—including editorial, sales, circulation and more.”

As a result, the Biobased Diesel® line is able to provide advertising packages to its existing and prospective clients for just a fraction of what its competitors charge, even if they were to provide deep discounts to their high prices.

Plus, with Kotrba’s vast network of industry connections and more than two decades of experience, he is able to assemble and curate the largest collection of original print articles written by the biggest, most well-known names and top experts in the field—issue after issue.

In fact, the Winter 2026 Biobased Diesel® print magazine is currently in development. Sales are open but space is filling up fast. For those interested in being part of the issue, please contact Kotrba to reserve advertising placement by Nov. 10.

The Winter 2026 Biobased Diesel® will receive special bonus distribution at two leading biofuel events this winter—the Clean Fuels Conference in Orlando, Florida, Jan. 19-22, 2026, and a special seat drop at the Iowa Renewable Fuels Summit in Altoona, Iowa, Feb. 5, 2026.

Don’t miss the chance to put your company and its offerings on full display for its target audience in the leading trade publication serving the biodiesel, renewable diesel, SAF and marine biofuel industries.

“If your company isn’t advertising with Biobased Diesel®, there is a good chance your competitors are,” Kotrba says.

Kotrba adds that 2026 is poised to be a potentially record-breaking year for the biobased diesel sector.

“I firmly believe 2026 will be a monumental year for biodiesel, renewable diesel, SAF and marine biofuel,” he says. “Industry advancements and capacity buildout—particularly for certain subsects of the broader biofuels industries—will continue globally driven by policy, corporate commitments to the environment and the urging of shareholders. In the U.S., EPA signaled earlier this year that it plans to unleash the American biobased diesel sector after years of lackluster volume requirements with its robust Renewable Fuel Standard proposal for 2026 and 2027.”

Furthermore, Kotrba says that with an extension of and significant revisions to the 45Z clean fuel production credit signed into law in July, along with the potential for full reallocation of recently waived RFS gallons from small-refinery exemptions (SREs), these three important pieces of the U.S. biofuel puzzle are falling into place. This is positioning the industries Biobased Diesel® serves to have a record year of production and project development.

“Lastly,” Kotrba says, “I would like to take this special opportunity to thank readers, subscribers, editorial contributors and advertisers for making Biobased Diesel Daily®, Biobased Diesel™ Weekly, and the Biobased Diesel® print journal a success over its five-year journey. I couldn’t have done this without you—thank you.”

The European-backed proponent has filed for environmental assessment

A group that wants to build an industrial plant on the Eastern Shore to produce fuels out of hydrogen and biomass has filed for environmental assessment with the province, kicking off a 40-day period when the public can have their say.

The application details Phase 1 of the project, which includes the construction and operation of a production facility near the mouth of Isaacs Harbour, N.S.

It says production would require 60 truckloads of biomass per day and 586 cubic metres of fresh water per hour. Biomass is organic matter — for example, wood — that is used to generate energy.

According to the application, the biomass would be sourced locally following the European Union’s sustainability requirements, and the fresh water would come from two nearby lakes, Meadow Lake and Ocean Lake, through pipelines.

If the province grants environmental approval, construction could begin in 2028 and operations in 2031, the application says. The proponent expects the project to have a minimum 50-year lifespan, followed by decommissioning.

The site is on the coast in the community of Goldboro, N.S., on land that was previously owned by Pieridae Energy. That firm had proposed building a liquefied natural gas terminal, but after abandoning that plan it sold the land and all its permits and approvals to the new proponents.

The project was first imagined by Irish firm Simply Blue Group but was bought earlier this year by European energy giant Octopus Energy Generation. Octopus created a local entity, Nova Sustainable Fuels, to manage the project.

In its application to the province, Nova Sustainable Fuels says it wants to use water, biomass and electricity from wind turbines to generate hydrogen gas. The gas would then be converted into methanol and sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, a lower-emission alternative to conventional jet fuel.

The liquid fuels would then be shipped by boat to distributors and airlines.

Phase 2 of the project would include a wind farm and transmission line to feed electricity directly to the plant, but that is not included in the current environmental assessment.

The application for Phase 1 says the project will require an initial capital investment of $4 billion to $6 billion. Construction is expected to create 1,000 jobs and operations are expected to require 60 to 80 staff.",https://www.cbc.ca/lite/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-29 13:01:09.576828

For ship operators, these drop-in fuels could provide a cost-effective and lower-carbon alternative to traditional heavy fuel oil.

With higher energy density than many current biofuel alternatives, this renewable marine fuel can extend a vessel’s range without requiring costly engine upgrades, according to Honeywell.

The breakthrough comes at a time of impasse in shipping when it comes to cutting carbon intensity. This month the International Maritime Organization Marine Environment Protection Committee voted to delay the adoption of the industry’s planned Net Zero Framework.

Ken West, President of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, said, “The maritime industry has a real need for renewable fuels that are immediately available and cost effective. Our Biocrude Upgrading processing technology can be delivered in modular form, offering savings from the point of installation through to refining and use.”

The tech means plant and agricultural waste can be converted into lower carbon biocrude at the feedstock collection sites, which keeps transport costs low.

The process technology enables biocrude to then be refined at major facilities to produce marine fuel, gasoline or SAF. This helps solve long-standing challenges with converting biocrudes into fuels with performance comparable to conventional fuel.

Biocrude Upgrading process technology can be delivered in the form of a prefabricated modular plant.

The news also comes shortly after a report from the European Union Safety Agency warns of the challenges in scaling SAF, with supplies concentrated in a small number of member states, although it found production capacity assessments indicate the EU is on track to meet the overall mandatory SAF blending target (6%) in 2030.

While efficiency improvements and electrification will play a part, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) remains the only scalable option for deep decarbonisation of long-haul flights this side of 2040. As a ‘drop-in’ fuel that works with existing aircraft, it offers the most practical route to near-term emissions reduction.

At the same time, waste disposal continues to pose environmental and financial challenges for local authorities. Could these two problems help solve each other?

Download a copy of our full Waste-to-SAF Feasibility Study below or read on for a short summary.

Introducing the project

As part of the Heathrow Strategic Planning Group’s “Runway to Net Zero” programme, City Science led a high-level feasibility study exploring whether residual municipal solid waste from across Surrey and the wider Heathrow area could form the basis of a local SAF production system.

The study examined:

Residual waste volumes and composition

Potential SAF yields under different production pathways

Likely impacts of new policies, such as the inclusion of Energy from Waste in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme

Infrastructure requirements to support SAF production including land, water, energy, and waste logistics

It also compared the indicative carbon performance of a waste-to-SAF pathway against current waste disposal via Energy from Waste incineration.

What we found

Through discussions with industry experts, we established that locating a waste-to-SAF plant near Heathrow (rather than in an industrial cluster which has been the focus of developments so far), there are some substantial benefits to be gained, such as a high population density generating large amounts of waste in a relatively small radius, and a significant nearby offtake in Heathrow Airport.

A geospatial analysis conducted using City Science’s Cadence platform mapped key waste infrastructure and existing waste flow routes, helping partners understand both the practical opportunities and the transport feasibility of future supply chains.

City Science used Surrey as a test bed for our analysis, which produces around 185,000 tonnes of residual municipal waste per year. Within this, the SAF-relevant fraction (paper and card, wood, plastics and textiles) totalled approximately 63,000 tonnes.

Depending on conversion efficiency, this material could produce up to 20,000 tonnes of SAF – enough to power hundreds of long-haul flights from Heathrow, while cutting waste disposal emissions by over a third compared with Energy from Waste incineration.

The analysis also showed that a commercial-size SAF facility would need to draw waste from multiple neighbouring authorities to reach viable scale, making the case for regional collaboration across the Heathrow Strategic Planning Group (HSPG) area and beyond.

Conclusions

With Heathrow at the heart of one of the UK’s largest waste-producing regions, there is a unique opportunity to align aviation decarbonisation with local waste and energy planning. Waste-to-SAF offers a compelling alternative to conventional disposal routes such as incineration or landfill, with significant environmental benefits.

Looking Ahead

Through projects like Runway to Net Zero, we’re supporting regions to turn climate ambition into action, contributing to the UK’s drive to be a leader in clean aviation and to deliver on the Jet Zero Strategy.

Phase 2 of Runway to Net Zero has demonstrated the potential for Waste-to-SAF in the HSPG region, showing the need for a regionally coordinated approach to SAF development. Next steps to progress this work should focus on pathways to implementation, including a wider assessment of feedstock availability, identification of SAF production sites, and reviewing the economic case.

This equates to 10% of the world’s transport-related energy consumption and 3% of total global energy consumption (IEA, 2024a).

Growth in aviation emissions has been continuous, but it has been partially offset by substantial efficiency improvements.
In addition to carbon emissions, aviation contributes to climate change through the formation of contrails.","Aviation plays a vital role in connecting people, enabling global business, facilitating international trade and tourism, and providing a means of rapid transportation. The sector drives economic growth, shortens travel times and increases global interconnectedness.

One of the main challenges faced by aviation, however, is providing its social and economic benefits while also increasing its environmental responsibility. As one of the most carbon-intensive transport modes, aviation is a significant contributor to global GHG emissions and climate change (DESNZ and BEIZ, 2022). The sector is also responsible for non CO2 emissions (i.e. other gases and aerosol particles) that affect both the atmospheric composition and cloudiness, adding to the impact of the sector’s CO2 emissions (Lee, 2018).

In recent decades, demand for aviation services has steadily grown and could double by 2050 compared with 2022 levels (Graver, 2022; IATA, 2023). Therefore, there is a need to rapidly deploy decarbonisation solutions.

Emissions and energy use

In 2023, the energy consumption of the global aviation sector reached 13 EJ. This equates to 10% of the world’s transport-related energy consumption and 3% of total global energy consumption (IEA, 2024a). This energy demand was met nearly exclusively by fossil fuels. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is expected to reach 2.1 million litres in 2025, representing just 0.7% of total jet fuel production (IATA, 2024).

Dependency on fossil fuels results in aviation contributing significantly to the world’s CO2 emissions and climate change. CO2 emissions from aviation in 2022 reached 0.9 Gt, equivalent to between 2% and 3% of global emissions and 11% of all transport-related emissions (IEA, 2023a). Growth in aviation emissions has been continuous, but it has been partially offset by substantial efficiency improvements. As shown in Figure 10, these improvements have resulted in as much as 11 GtCO2 in emission reductions since 1990 (ATAG, 2021). In addition to carbon emissions, aviation contributes to climate change through the formation of contrails.

Due to the mass and volume limitations of aircraft, aviation depends on highly energy-dense fuels. There are sustainable fuel alternatives, but these come with a cost premium. The limited choice of usable fuels and the immaturity of alternative aircraft technologies, such as electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft, therefore limit the decarbonisation pathways available to the sector.

Decarbonisation pathways

One decarbonisation pathway for aviation is the continued deployment of technological and operational energy efficiency improvements. Although the aviation sector has made significant progress in deploying increasingly efficient airframes and engines, there is still potential for further improvement. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) long-term aspirational goal aims for a 2% increase in fuel efficiency annually until 2050. This is higher than the average historically observed, and other projected, improvements of just 1.5% per year (ICAO, 2022a).

According to IRENA’s 1.5°C scenario, demand reduction and energy efficiency improvement are an important part of the sector’s decarbonisation efforts. These measures could account for roughly half of the sector’s emission reductions by 2050 13 (IRENA, 2023c). Further reductions could come from modal shifts in short-distance air travel – for example, replacing short flights with trains, which are much less carbon intensive (European Environment Agency, 2023).

The most technologically straightforward pathway to decarbonise the sector, however, is the use of advanced biofuels, namely biojet, given the maturity of the technology. Biojet can be used as a drop-in fuel on existing and future aircraft, making it a practical and immediately implementable option. Long-term bioenergy potential is not a constraint for the transition of the sector, either. IRENA suggests that the global technical potential for sustainable advanced biofuels is at least 114 EJ (IRENA, 2016b) or roughly eight times the energy demand for aviation. Current global biofuel production is only around 4.5 EJ, however, and is mostly food and feed crop based (90%) and used mainly for road transport (OECD/FAO, 2023).

The main challenges with biofuel are, first, its higher cost compared with conventional jet fuel and, second, the need to scale up its supply sustainably. Indeed, the rapid scale-up of sustainable biomass is complex and cannot be achieved without careful consideration of its potential negative impacts, particularly in terms of land use change and life-cycle GHG emissions. Minimizing these impacts requires strict controls along the entire supply chain, robust certification mechanisms and substantial policy interventions in the agriculture sector. At the same time, the increasing electrification of road transport could allow biofuel production capacity to be redirected towards other sectors, such as aviation and shipping.

Another option is the adoption of synthetic fuels produced from green hydrogen, which is produced from electrolysed water using renewable electricity. This can then be combined with a renewable source of carbon to produce a hydrocarbon fuel. The two options currently being considered are green hydrogen and e-kerosene. Although hydrogen could eliminate exhaust emissions from aviation, hydrogen aircraft technology for large passenger or cargo transport does not exist yet. This technology is also not expected to reach commercial maturity within a time frame compatible with making a material impact on carbon neutrality by mid-century. A fundamental issue revolves around the low volumetric energy density of hydrogen, which would require a fundamental redesign of airframes as well as operational procedures and safety standards. Furthermore, there is no hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in place.

E-kerosene, on the other hand, is chemically identical to its fossil counterpart and could be used in existing aircraft. The use of e-kerosene opens the door for deep emission reductions. However, the fact that the e-kerosene molecule contains carbon adds a layer of complexity. For e-kerosene to be an effective decarbonisation solution, it would have to be low carbon, and this carbon would need to come from a sustainable source (i.e. from biogenic sources such as bioenergy with CO2 capture or captured directly from the atmosphere). The need to build a sustainable supply chain for carbon is a major challenge, particularly given that to achieve cost efficiency, cheap renewable electricity for hydrogen production and a sustainable (and scalable) carbon source would need to be available.

However, if these challenges can be met, biofuels and e-fuels could account for the remaining half of the CO2 reductions needed by 2050, under IRENA’s 1.5°C scenario.

Electric propulsion is another technology pathway that should be considered for aviation. In the past, this has had limited potential as a decarbonisation solution due to the limited energy density of commercially available batteries. However, there has been remarkable progress in battery technologies over the last few years. Breakthroughs in energy density, with some batteries reaching 500 Wh/kg, could open the door the application of such batteries in electric or hybrid small aircraft and short-haul flights (CATL, 2023).

Electric propulsion also offers potential advantages over jet engines in areas such as higher efficiency, lower mechanical complexity and maintenance costs. Yet this pathway is not without its challenges. These challenges include the need to develop and certify new aircraft concepts and the need for further research and development in battery technologies to make them viable for flight as well as ground operations. These challenges also limit the decarbonisation potential of this technological pathway, given that new aircraft concepts can take as long as a decade to be developed and certified (FAA, 2023).",,N,,2025-10-29 13:57:23.936626

Economic growth and air freight capacity The government's support for expansion projects at Heathrow and Gatwick is rooted in a strategy for economic growth.
""Over 60% of UK air freight comes through Heathrow.
The committee doubts this approach, noting that SAF is not produced at a commercial scale large enough to offset emissions from airport expansion.
This policy lag creates uncertainty for businesses that depend on air freight and long-term infrastructure planning.","The approved expansion of the UK's primary air freight hubs could jeopardise the nation's net-zero commitments, a cross-party committee of MPs has warned.

The government has been urged to clarify how it will mitigate the environmental impact of new runways at Heathrow and Gatwick airports before construction begins.

A report from the Commons Environmental Audit Committee suggests current policies are not sufficient to reduce carbon emissions from aviation in line with legal targets, particularly as demand for air travel and freight is projected to increase.

This situation creates a conflict between bolstering the UK's supply chain infrastructure and adhering to climate change targets.

Economic growth and air freight capacity

The government's support for expansion projects at Heathrow and Gatwick is rooted in a strategy for economic growth.

Since the 2024 general election, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves have endorsed the new runways.

The Chancellor explains the strategic importance of Heathrow, stating: ""It connects us to emerging markets all over the world, opening up new opportunities for growth. Around three quarters of all long haul flights go from Heathrow.

""Over 60% of UK air freight comes through Heathrow. And about 15 million business travellers use Heathrow in 2023.”

However, the committee's report challenges this economic-first approach.

""The government has not demonstrated that the economic growth from airport expansion provides enough benefit to outweigh the negative climate and environmental impacts it will lead to,"" the report states.

The critique highlights a central tension for supply chain leaders: while expanded airport capacity could mean more efficient logistics, the associated environmental costs and regulatory risks are significant.

John McDonnell, Labour’s MP for Hayes and Harlington, commented on the Heathrow expansion, calling it a “huge political, economic and especially environmental mistake”.

Sustainable aviation fuel and logistical hurdles

The government's ""jet zero"" strategy for greener aviation relies heavily on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The committee doubts this approach, noting that SAF is not produced at a commercial scale large enough to offset emissions from airport expansion.

These concerns are highlighted by real-world examples, such as Air New Zealand's decision last year to abandon its 2030 decarbonisation target due to difficulties in procuring SAF.

It demonstrates the challenges faced by the global aviation sector in securing a stable and affordable supply of alternative fuels, a critical factor for the long-term sustainability of supply chains.

Outdated policy and investment uncertainty

The expansion projects are set to proceed before the government updates its airports national policy statement, which dates back to 2018.

The committee argues this allows the government to avoid proper scrutiny and base decisions on a framework that is not aligned with current climate objectives.

This policy lag creates uncertainty for businesses that depend on air freight and long-term infrastructure planning.

Toby Perkins, the Labour Chair of the committee, warns that decarbonisation already represents a challenge.

""Expanding airport capacity is likely to make that task much harder,"" Toby says. ""Under the government's existing 'jet zero' strategy, expanding airport capacity is likely to put net zero at serious risk.""

Alethea Warrington, Head of Aviation at climate charity Possible, describes the report as the ""final nail in the coffin"" for the government's case.

She says: ""The government's scrutiny committee has made it clearer than ever that airport growth is a bad option for Britain, and that the government simply doesn't have any economic evidence to justify the environmental devastation this would cause.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/10f3a912f5b872a0930165add8b4405b:04c0090e6985de475def6ea019635a21/gettyimages-2197839670.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 12:00:17.188446

Applications would be screened by ICAO and IRENA before being presented to financing and de-risking partners within the ETAF platform.

As the collaboration matured, ICAO would introduce other financing partners to expand the concept, the report said.

The launch of the Finvest initiative came against a backdrop of growing industry concerns about insufficient production of SAF and other low carbon aviation products, the high costs to airlines of procuring the fuels and uneven access to supplies as global demand for air travel continues to soar, Greenair News wrote.

“This launch marks a significant milestone in aviation’s net zero carbon emission journey,” ICAO’s secretary general Juan Carlos Salazar was quoted as saying.

“It is a … gateway between project developers and financiers.”

The Finvest initiative was part of a four-point Global Framework for SAF, that was agreed by ICAO member states at the third Conference on Aviation and Alternative Fuels (CAAF/3) held in Dubai in 2023.

ICAO member states agreed at the meeting to a 2030 vision of “an aspirational global interim goal” of a 5% reduction in the carbon intensity of aviation fuel. In addition to financing, the plan focused on policy and planning, regulatory frameworks and implementation support.

According to its website, ICAO and its 193 member states develop and implement global aviation strategies, technical standards and capacity building activities to enhance the safety, sustainability and inclusivity of air services worldwide.

The Airshow wants sustainability to be visible not only in aircraft technology, but in how the event itself is run.","Sustainability will be the headline theme at Dubai Airshow 2025, with organisers planning tangible measures that demonstrate how lower-carbon aviation can be achieved today rather than discussed for tomorrow.

Running from 17 to 21 November at Dubai World Central, the 19th edition will gather airports, OEMs, regulators, operators and energy partners to accelerate adoption of cleaner technology.

Dubai Airports, Airbus, Boeing, the World Economic Forum, Airports Council International and the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority are among the confirmed participants.

Dubai Airports’ Director of Sustainability, Sven Deckers, said the industry has entered a delivery rather than a planning phase, noting that sustainability is “no longer about future ambition, it is a current necessity” and that the Airshow provides the right forum to turn shared goals into action.

Real-world green operations

A new feature will spotlight how lower-carbon aircraft turnaround can work in practice. The oneDXB Sustainability Alliance, led by Dubai Airports with dnata, flydubai and service providers, will run live demonstrations showing near-term solutions for greener ground operations at DXB and DWC.

This guided tour presents equipment and processes expected to be on their way into the market, showing a step-by-step approach to cutting emissions on the apron through joint industry action, rather than isolated initiatives.

SAF and cleaner show operations

Sustainable aviation fuel will once again be available for aircraft taking part in flying and static displays, supplied in partnership with Jetex, the same company, which began offering SAF to private aviation customers in the UAE in 2023.

Chief Executive Adel Mardini noted, that supplying SAF at the Airshow forms part of a collective industry effort to decarbonise aviation, and that strategy stems on reducing emissions through practical adoption of cleaner energy sources.

Show operations are also being adapted. Electric and propane-powered ground support equipment will be used across the site to limit emissions generated during the show’s peformances.

Expanded sustainability conference

The Airshow’s sustainability conference has been extended to two days and will cover topics including SAF scale-up, next-generation fuels, airport decarbonisation, green finance and technology investment.

Confirmed speakers include ACI World Director General Justin Erbacci, GACA Executive Vice President for Aviation Safety and Environmental Sustainability Captain Sulaiman Almuhaimedi, and Dubai Airports’ Sven Deckers.

Airbus said it views the show as an important platform to advance joint pathways, with the company’s Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuels and Carbon Dioxide Removal, Julien Manhes, emphasising the value of partnerships in accelerating the industry’s transition.

Boeing repeats this stance. Jeff Shockey, the company’s Executive Vice President for Government Operations, Public Policy and Corporate Strategy, said Dubai Airshow 2025 comes at a time of progress for the sector in the region, and that Boeing remains focused on commercially viable solutions that support sustainable aviation growth.

Greener exhibition model

Sustainability efforts will extend well beyond the runway and show floor. This year’s edition is set to overhaul how major trade events operate in Dubai, with organisers pushing to make the Airshow itself a working model for lower-impact exhibitions.

The Better Stands Programme returns with a stronger mandate for reusable and modular builds, aiming to reduce single-use construction materials that typically end up in landfill after large events.

Exhibition halls, chalets and feature zones will run on 100% renewable electricity and prioritise recycled or reusable materials throughout.

Operational changes are also being scaled up. Solar-powered maintenance cabins will rise by 50% compared with the last edition, and visitors will be offered lower-emission transport options across the city to reduce event-related travel emissions.

Finally, even attendee habits are being targeted. Airbus-backed hydration stations from Bluewater-Nia will remove single-use plastic bottles from the venue, while Rove Hotels steps in as official partner with LEED Gold-certified accommodation.

The 42nd International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly closed on October 3, 2025.

In the fragmented, competitive world of aviation, the race to harmonize global sustainability policies has never been more vital.

The international aviation community is flying through heavy crosswinds, but its flight path to net zero, for the moment, seems to remain unaltered.

The 42nd International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly closed on October 3, 2025, in Montreal.

During these triennial assemblies, delegations from up to 193 states convene to review and set ICAO priorities, budget and goals. This year’s Assembly has been particularly closely watched as it was the first meeting after the previous Assembly’s landmark commitment for international aviation to achieve net zero by 2050.

During the preceding General Assembly in 2022, ICAO had agreed on a Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It also consolidated the implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) as the first global sectoral market-based scheme for international aviation, which has seen the pool of voluntary states’ participation increase from 88 in 2021 to 130 today.

With a shifting geopolitical context that has been de-prioritizing climate policies, concerns that international sustainable aviation ambitions might be toned down were legitimate. This triennial Assembly, however, demonstrated a global consensus on environmental topics and succeeded in reaffirming the commitment of ICAO Member States to the LTAG.

Non-sustainability items were also the Assembly’s core focus. To address emerging risks, such as recent air transport incidents, increased geopolitical tensions and armed conflicts, and the multiplication of new forms of cybersecurity threats, ICAO states committed to enhancing the global safety and security framework for aviation, in line with ICAO’s long-term aspiration of zero fatalities worldwide.

What was agreed on sustainable air transportation during this Assembly?

Following the adoption of the LTAG, the efforts of ICAO over the last three years have been focused on the implementation of pragmatic measures to achieve this goal. These include:

The adoption of new carbon emissions and noise stringent standards for new aircraft type designs and in-production aircraft types.

The adoption of a robust monitoring and reporting methodology to track progress towards the LTAG (LTAG Monitoring and Reporting Methodology).

The Endorsement of the ICAO Global Framework for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF) and other Aviation Cleaner Energies, ICAO’s plan to achieve a 5% CO2 emissions reduction in international aviation by 2030 on the path towards this net-zero aspirational goal by 2050.

Support for accelerated investment in clean technology solutions through the operationalization of ICAO’s Finvest Hub, a platform that connects project developers, financiers and government institutions to bridge the gap between aviation decarbonization projects and the required capital to deploy them, with a specific focus on SAF.

The renewed commitment to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), the world’s only global market-based measure for international aviation.

The extension of the ICAO ACT-SAF (its capability building programme to support countries as they explore SAF) to an ACT-LTAG programme, aimed at providing assistance and implementation support for all emissions reduction measures (including operational and infrastructural measures).

The emphasized attention to climate change adaptation and resilience with support to further action on adaptation.

What is the World Economic Forum doing to reduce aviation's carbon footprint?

As other sectors proceed to decarbonize, the aviation sector could account for a much higher share of global greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century than its 2%-3% share today.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) can reduce the life-cycle carbon footprint of aviation fuel by up to 80%, but they currently make up less than 0.1% of total aviation fuel consumption. Enabling a shift from fossil fuels to SAFs will require a significant increase in production, which is a costly investment.

The Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow (CST) Coalition is a global initiative driving the transition to sustainable aviation fuels as part of the aviation industry’s ambitious efforts to achieve carbon-neutral flying.

Loading...

The coalition brings together government leaders, climate experts and CEOs from aviation, energy, finance and other sectors who agree on the urgent need to help the aviation industry reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The coalition aims to advance the commercial scale of viable production of sustainable low-carbon aviation fuels (bio and synthetic) for broad adoption in the industry by 2030. Initiatives include a mechanism for aggregating demand for carbon-neutral flying, a co-investment vehicle and geographically specific value-chain industry blueprints.

The Airports of Tomorrow’s priorities were also heard

Airports Council International (ACI) World played a central role in ensuring that airports’ perspectives were fully represented in discussions shaping the future of global aviation, from air connectivity and passenger experience issues, to energy transition and sustainable economic growth. ACI World notably called on states to ensure that airports have access to sufficient reliable, renewable and affordable energy supplies. This appeal underscored the importance of coordinated national policies to help airports meet rising energy needs, while achieving long-term decarbonization targets. As aviation strives towards net-zero goals, ensuring airports can source renewable power is fundamental to maintaining resilient, efficient and sustainable operations.

Concretely, what does that mean for global aviation decarbonization ambitions?

No backtracking on current ambitions can already be considered as a positive message. Additionally, this assembly succeeded in endorsing ambitious progress to continue implementing the measures that will decarbonize the aviation sector.

The implementation of the Global Framework will be key for the future of sustainable fuels, by providing long-term, stable support to attract the necessary investments and demand needed to get them to scale.

On the back of this unaltered commitment, an increasing number of environmentally ambitious regions will likely continue to pursue and adopt decarbonization policies. This alignment is essential to avoid a global patchwork of varying sustainability ambitions.

Europe: Currently leading the way on aviation climate policies, developments on CORSIA – and whether EU legislators will judge it ambitious enough – will impact the upcoming review of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). This might broaden the number of routes subject to carbon pricing, while transportation modes battle each other over which will draw the most support out of the upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP).

US: On the other side of the Atlantic, betting on incentives, rather than mandates, the US has instead relaxed some of its SAF feedstock sustainability criteria through the One Big Beautiful Act, opening the door to cheaper, but also less environmentally beneficial, fuel pathways.

Asia-Pacific (APAC): SAF policies are ramping up across several APAC countries (e.g, Singapore’s SAF levy, Australia’s Cleaner Fuels Programme unleashing $1.1 billion in incentives, mandates in Japan, Malaysia, Thailand etc.), though at a slower pace than in Europe, at least at this stage, and with less stringent approaches to feedstock sustainability criteria.

In such a fragmented world of aviation decarbonization policies and a fiercer than ever competitive environment, the race to harmonize global sustainability policies has never felt more essential.

Within an increasingly shifting and unstable geopolitical environment, the international aviation community is increasingly flying through heavy crosswinds, but its flight path to net zero for the moment seems to have remained unaltered.

The process generates lower-carbon marine fuel, gasoline, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from low-cost, widely available biomass such as crop residues and wood chips, according to the press release.

For ship operators, these “drop-in” fuels offer a cost-efficient, lower-carbon alternative to traditional heavy fuel oil. With a higher energy density than many existing biofuels, the renewable marine fuel can extend a vessel’s operational range without the need for expensive engine modifications.

“Honeywell continues to innovate in areas where our customers need solutions most,” said Ken West, president of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions. “The maritime sector requires renewable fuels that are both readily available and affordable. Our Biocrude Upgrading technology can be deployed in modular form, delivering savings from installation through refining and end use.”

The technology allows plant and agricultural waste to be converted into lower-carbon biocrude at feedstock collection sites, minimizing transport costs. This biocrude can then be refined at major facilities to produce marine fuel, gasoline, or SAF, overcoming long-standing challenges in achieving fuel performance comparable to conventional products.

Honeywell’s Biocrude Upgrading process can be implemented as a prefabricated modular plant, helping customers reduce risk and speed up project timelines by simplifying construction.

The launch comes as shipping companies face growing pressure from both regulations and customers to cut carbon emissions.

Since its launch by the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Defence Industry and Space (DG DEFIS) in 2022, AZEA has grown into a community of more than 200 members across the aviation value chain, including manufacturers, operators, airports, energy providers, fuel suppliers, and regulators.

Advancing Europe’s zero emission vision

Hosted by EUROCONTROL for the fourth time, the AZEA brought together industry leaders, policymakers, and innovators committed to accelerating the deployment of electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft in Europe.

The session opened with a keynote video message from Member of the European Parliament Daniel Attard, underlining the strategic importance of zero-emission aviation for Europe’s industrial competitiveness and sustainability goals.

The primary focus of the meeting was the presentation of the first draft of AZEA’s comprehensive Roadmap, a deliverable designed to guide the aviation ecosystem toward widespread adoption of zero-emission technologies.

Developed with support from Deloitte and aviation consultancy To70, the Roadmap outlines the practical steps to implement AZEA’s long-term vision, first unveiled in June 2024. The final version is expected to be adopted by the first quarter of 2026, setting the course for a coordinated and efficient rollout across the sector.

Collaborative progress across working groups

AZEA’s Working Groups used the occasion to show their progress and outline their priorities for 2026. These groups are addressing the many dimensions of zero-emission aviation, including infrastructure and regulation, certification, energy supply, and market readiness. Their ongoing work will extend beyond the delivery of the Roadmap, ensuring sustained collaboration and alignment across the European aviation ecosystem.

The industry group recently submitted a letter to members of the European Commission arguing that this targeted mechanism is crucial for de-risking investments and accelerating the production of Europe’s most sustainable drop-in aviation fuel.

Background: SASHA and the STIP

The need for this intervention arises from the EU’s overarching goals to decarbonize transport, particularly aviation and maritime sectors, which are hard-to-electrify.

The SASHA Coalition (Skies and Seas Hydrogen-fuels Accelerator Coalition) is an alliance bringing together leading companies across the green shipping and aviation ecosystems. The Coalition advocates for EU and UK policies that support the development and commercialization of sustainable green hydrogen energy solutions. SASHA’s research indicates that green hydrogen is essential for all pathways to truly sustainable fuels in these sectors.

The target of SASHA’s lobbying effort, the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), is expected to be a major pillar of the Clean Industrial Deal, announced in the first half of 2025. The STIP aims to scale and prioritize investments for decarbonizing all EU transport modes. Expected for publication in late 2025, the plan will focus on reducing risks for private investments in renewable and low-carbon fuels and enhancing the EU’s strategic autonomy.

EU Advocacy Manager at the SASHA Coalition, Delphine Kaczorowski, summarized the impact of the STIP by saying:

“The STIP could mark a watershed moment for European clean flight innovation, but only if it targets the most promising solutions including e-kerosene, the most sustainable and scalable drop-in alternative fuel. A book-and-claim system could be a crucial tool for unlocking clean competitive aviation, but including all alternative fuels would dilute impact and divert incentives to biofuels that are less sustainable, less competitive at scale, and less in need of support.

When strategically limited to e-kerosene, book-and-claim can help Europe’s boldest clean aviation innovators overcome the market failures holding them back.”

Book-and-Claim: Unlocking the E-SAF Market

E-kerosene, or synthetic aviation fuel (e-SAF), produced using renewable hydrogen, is recognized as the most scalable and sustainable alternative drop-in jet fuel. Despite Europe holding over half of the global production capacity for this fuel, producers are struggling to secure the final investment decisions (FID) needed to scale up.

This difficulty is exacerbated by high capital costs and a geographical mismatch: producers are often located where renewable energy capacity is abundant, while early buyers are concentrated in larger aviation hubs.

A well-regulated book-and-claim system provides a solution by allowing the physical e-SAF to be sold to one buyer and its certified green attributes (or credentials) to be sold separately to another buyer.

The SASHA Coalition highlights several ways a well-regulated B&C system would improve the European e-SAF market:

De-risking Investment: By widening the pool of viable buyers and allowing producers to overcome geographical restrictions, B&C helps achieve revenue stability, thereby lowering the risk premium on investment and giving investors the financial certainty needed to reach FID.

Increased Market Access and Reduced Costs: Separating the physical fuel from its sustainability characteristics expands market access for producers and reduces the costs and carbon emissions associated with transporting the physical e-SAF over long distances.

Regulatory Compliance: For aircraft operators (offtakers), B&C would increase the pool of e-SAF producers available to them, making compliance with ReFuelEU Aviation targets easier.

Strategic Limitations to Prevent Dilution

In July of this year, the SASHA Coalition emphasized that B&C is not a “silver bullet” but a transformative complement to other revenue certainty mechanisms like Contracts for Difference (CfD). Crucially, the system must be strictly regulated to ensure it drives Europe’s Clean Industrial Deal goals and supports the nascent e-kerosene industry rather than unintentionally boosting less sustainable alternatives.

Accordingly, the letter outlines three necessary criteria for the B&C system:

Exclusively for E-kerosene/E-SAF: This targets support toward the most sustainable but least mature alternative drop-in fuel, ensuring impact is not diluted and incentives are not diverted toward more easily available biofuels. Biofuels are currently more competitive and require less de-risking support than e-SAF.

Operates Only Within the EEA: Limiting the scope to the European Economic Area concentrates competitiveness gains and industrial innovation among European producers, supporting long-term energy security.

Timebound with an End-Date: A fixed end date is necessary to ensure market actors remain incentivized to invest in the physical supply chain infrastructure needed for long-term distributed access to e-SAF across the EU.

The Non-CO2 Climate Impact

While the primary focus of e-SAF adoption is the reduction of CO2 emissions, the broader transition to clean technologies in aviation holds additional environmental benefits. The STIP is encouraged to support the development and adoption of zero-carbon emission technologies by investing in hydrogen infrastructure in airports and green Public Service Obligation (PSO) routes. Investment in alternative propulsion systems, such as electric or hydrogen fuel cell-powered aircraft, is essential because these technologies offer the additional benefit of mitigating both CO2 and non-CO2 climate impacts. This focus aligns with the objective to clean up and modernize transport to meet future environmental demands.

But current minor variations in national taxes, charges and fees do not show a strong correlation with demand.","Aviation demand is primarily driven by airline strategies and travel trends, economists say.

A new study by two economists, commissioned by green group T&E, shows that aviation demand depends mostly on airline strategy and market trends, such as changed travel behaviour. This refutes airlines’ claims that national aviation taxes and fees are solely responsible for driving passengers away, says T&E.

The study looks at the relationship between location-based costs and passenger volumes for 101 European airports in 2024 [1]. Findings show that airports with low costs do not guarantee higher passenger numbers. In fact, airports with higher costs tend to have more passengers. Heathrow Airport for example has the highest location-based costs but also the highest passenger numbers in Europe. Consequently, the study finds there is only a weak correlation between costs and passenger numbers in this order of magnitude of taxation [2]. This is also shown by a further analysis of the relationship between changes in ticket prices and changes in passenger numbers to date, which again only found a weak correlation. Hubs, international agreements, and market strategies are more likely to determine whether an airport is important and being served.

Marte van der Graaf, aviation officer at T&E, says: “Airlines are trying to tell an easy story by blaming location costs for decreased demand. But this is just a campaign to cut taxes and fees. Demand for flying is not such a simple numbers game. In reality, strategic decisions by airlines, trends in travel behaviour, and airline business models influence passenger numbers, rather than costs alone.”

Historically, increased prices in air travel have not curbed demand. In Germany, for example, the 2019 jet fuel price was twice as high as in 2000, but in the same period passenger numbers grew by 75%. Demand in aviation is instead mainly determined by supply. Airlines set their flight schedules months in advance and then fill seats by adjusting prices. Associated costs like hotel expenses could also affect demand, the study suggests.

Reduced passenger demand could also be linked to the global decline in business travel after the COVID pandemic. T&E's Travel Smart Campaign finds that business travel by the world’s biggest companies fell by 34% between 2019 and 2023. Meanwhile, leisure travel is growing in dominance. While business travellers usually fly to economic centres, leisure travel is concentrated towards holiday destinations, increasing air travel to southern European countries by 10 to 20% in 2025, compared to 2019. Overall, trends in travel behavior tend to have a greater impact on passenger demand than taxation and other costs.

T&E recommends national governments not to cap or reduce levies. Cutting aviation taxes, fees and charges would mean throwing away billions in public revenues without a tangible effect on passenger numbers. National ticket taxes should be designed to reflect economic externalities, i.e. the most climate-damaging tickets should have the highest taxes. This means higher tax rates for first and business class tickets and higher tax rates for long haul flights.

“Airlines tirelessly blame levies for their billion-dollar business not doing as well as usual. If taxes and fees were lowered now, it would simply be a gift to the airlines, while emptying national budgets from much needed money. The revenue from fair taxation could be invested in sustainable aviation fuel.”, concludes van der Graaf.

[1] The study by economists Prof. Friedrich Thießen and Prof. Christoph Brützel analyzed costs for airports arising from national levies and compared the number of passengers traveling to and from these airports. It was factored in if the airport type changes results. Also, it was verified that a traditional price elasticity analysis is not reliable in aviation. The study amplifies a DLR study from April 2025.

[2] With proper taxation, which would imply another order of magnitude of cost increases, aviation taxation could become a demand management tool.

With air traffic almost back to pre-COVID levels, aviation could account for up to 20% of global emissions by 2050 without stronger decarbonisation measures.

Recognising this challenge, the commercial aviation sector has committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. To get there, the industry must scale low-carbon fuels alongside efficiency improvements in aircraft and operations. Among these solutions, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as one of the most immediate and scalable pathways to cut emissions from air travel.

This guide unpacks what sustainable aviation fuel is, how it reduces emissions, and where agriculture fits in — as both a source of renewable feedstocks and a driver of regional opportunity.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, produced from non-fossil sources such as:

Oilseeds (e.g., canola, soybeans, sunflower, safflower)

Agricultural residues (e.g., sugarcane trash, stubble)

Dedicated energy crops (e.g., pongamia)

Waste products (e.g., tallow, used cooking oils)

READ MORE: Get on board: Experts urge Australia to prepare for sustainable aviation fuel take-off

Chemically, SAF is almost identical to conventional jet fuel, meaning it can be a drop-in replacement that works with existing aircraft engines and infrastructure. It can also be mixed in with conventional jet fuel with no impact on performance, with the current regulations allowing for up to a 50% blend.

What makes SAF sustainable is its feedstock origin. Instead of drawing carbon from underground fossil reserves, it relies on biogenic carbon (carbon already cycling through plants, residues, or waste streams.) By turning agricultural by-products or renewable crops into fuel, SAF links aviation to the circular bioeconomy: keeping carbon in motion rather than adding new emissions to the atmosphere.

How does Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduce emissions?

SAF lowers aviation emissions across its entire lifecycle, not just at the point of combustion. Lifecycle assessments show it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, depending on feedstock and production pathway.

The key difference lies in its carbon cycle. Fossil fuels release carbon that has been locked underground for millions of years, adding new CO₂ to the atmosphere. SAF reuses carbon already cycling through the biosphere, absorbed by plants during growth.

While most of SAF’s emission savings occur during the feedstock phase, additional reductions come from:

Cleaner production pathways: Renewable conversion technologies (such as HEFA, Fischer–Tropsch, and Alcohol-to-Jet) consume less energy than petroleum refining, lowering upstream emissions.

Avoiding methane emissions from decomposing organic waste.

Integrating feedstock systems with regenerative agriculture: improving soil carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling, while linking aviation to broader decarbonisation goals.

By combining lifecycle emissions savings with the practical advantage of drop-in fuel, SAF offers a scalable near-term solution that connects agriculture, innovation, and aviation in a single circular system.

Agricultural feedstocks: A new opportunity for farmers?

As demand for renewable aviation fuel grows, agriculture is emerging as a critical enabler. Many SAF pathways rely on bio-based feedstocks, creating new markets for underutilised or undervalued materials produced on farms.

Potential agricultural feedstocks include:

Crop and forestry residues such as stubble, husks, and straw

Waste oils and fats from food processing or livestock rendering

Energy crops like pongamia that can grow on marginal land.

For farmers, this shift opens diversification opportunities, turning waste into value through a new bio-industrial supply chain. In Australia, emerging projects such as Jet Zero’s ‘Regions to the Runway’ are exploring SAF potential through integrated feedstock supply, regional biorefineries, and logistics networks, with the end goal of positioning our country for domestic fuel security and export advantage.

Benefits of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Climate and emissions reduction

SAF represents one of the most practical near-term pathways for decarbonising long-haul aviation. Each litre of SAF used directly displaces fossil jet fuel, reducing net CO₂ emissions and helping airlines meet their net zero targets and commitments.

Diversification for rural economies

Developing SAF supply chains can stimulate regional industries, from feedstock aggregation and pre-processing to biorefining and logistics. This diversification offers new income streams, creates jobs and strengthens community resilience – and fosters collaboration between the agriculture and energy sectors.

Compatibility with existing infrastructure

Because SAF can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel, it integrates seamlessly into today’s fuel systems and aircraft. This drop-in capability gives it a major advantage over alternative technologies that require entirely new engines or refuelling infrastructure.

Challenges and limitations of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

SAF faces several challenges on the route to reaching its potential:

Cost: SAF is currently two to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, due largely to the limited availability of sustainable feedstocks, the continuing development of new production technologies, and limited commercial-scale production capacity

Feedstock competition: SAF must deliver around two thirds of the sector’s emissions reductions if it is to reach net zero by 2050. That requires production of around 450 billion litres per year. In 2025, it is expected to reach 2.1 billion litres – just 0.5% of the volume needed by 2050. But scaling production could increase pressure on land and water resources, unless waste and residue-based sources are prioritised.

Scaling uptake: SAF production currently represents less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel use.

Policy uncertainty: Long-term investment depends on stable policy, certification frameworks, clear sustainability criteria, and incentives to de-risk capital flows into new biorefineries.

These challenges underscore the importance of continued innovation in both feedstock supply and fuel conversion technologies – areas where agrifood research and collaboration can deliver transformative breakthroughs.

Powering cleaner skies with agriculture in the driving seat

The transition to sustainable aviation fuel is not just about cleaner energy – it’s about rethinking where that energy comes from. Agriculture holds the potential to supply renewable carbon for the aviation sector not through extraction, but regeneration: farming in ways that restore soils, boost ecosystem function, and recycle waste.",https://www.evokeag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/evokeAG_Ticketing-01-web.jpeg,N,,2025-10-29 05:56:17.800207

Renewable diesel and other biofuels production capacity increased just 391 million gallons per year (gal/y) in 2024, less than one-third of the growth observed in 2022 and 2023. In 2024, only two capacity additions came online, both in California: Phillips 66’s conversion of its Rodeo refinery to exclusively produce biofuels and the new Renewable Fuels LLC plant in Bakersfield.

With the completed conversion, the Rodeo plant has a capacity of 767 million gal/y, up from 180 million gal/y in last year’s report. This increase makes it the second-largest renewable diesel plant in the United States, behind Diamond Green Diesel’s 982-million-gal/y plant in Norco, Louisiana.

U.S. capacity growth from the Rodeo expansion and the 138-million-gal/y Bakersfield plant was partially offset by the loss of capacity at four facilities. Monroe Energy and Chevron stopped co-processing renewable diesel at their Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, refineries, respectively. Vertex Energy and Jaxon Energy closed plants in Mobile, Alabama, and Jackson, Mississippi, respectively.

The loss of renewable diesel capacity at four facilities reflects changes to biofuel margins and petroleum refining margins since 2020. Low refinery margins and rising biofuel credit values in 2020 and 2021 prompted a wave of renewable diesel capacity announcements. As more of those plants started operations, biofuel production began exceeding target volumes, and biofuel credit values and margins decreased in 2023. At the same time, petroleum refinery margins were much stronger than their 2020 lows, resulting in a slowdown in investments to expand renewable diesel capacity for the upcoming years.

A notable shift in 2024 was the increased focus on SAF. SAF is an alternative to petroleum jet fuel that we capture in our other biofuels category. Other biofuels includes SAF, renewable heating oil, renewable naphtha, renewable propane, renewable gasoline, and other emerging biofuels. We combine other biofuels with renewable diesel capacity because other biofuels are mostly produced at renewable diesel plants as byproducts or, often in the case of SAF, in place of renewable diesel. Following the completion of conversion projects in 2024, Phillips 66’s Rodeo plant can shift about 150 million gal/y of its renewable diesel production capacity to SAF, and Diamond Green Diesel can shift about 235 million gal/y to SAF.

Biodiesel

In addition to slower growth in renewable diesel production capacity, biodiesel production capacity decreased slightly. In 2024, eight biodiesel plants closed due to poor margins, resulting in a loss of about 100 million gal/y of production capacity.

Fuel ethanol

Unlike renewable diesel and biodiesel, U.S. fuel ethanol production capacity increased more in 2024 than in previous years. Fuel ethanol accounts for 73% of all biofuels production capacity, with a total of almost 18.5 billion gallons of capacity per year. Most of this production is concentrated in Midwest states, where corn is produced for feedstock. Because U.S. fuel ethanol consumption has been somewhat flat in recent years, the increased capacity is mostly contributing to growing exports of ethanol.",https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/ficheroenergias/fotos/agenda/ampliada/b/biofuelchart.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 03:01:45.437270

Thailand’s first standard for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) specifications is expected to be released this month and enforced next year, starting at 1% and increasing to 8% by 2036. The move aims to decarbonize the aviation sector in line with international measures and support the country’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

Industry and government align as Thailand prepares for SAF takeoff

As the SAF standard nears launch, the industry is gearing up to build a full supply chain, from raw materials to jet fuel. Thailand’s leading biofuel producer, Bangchak, inaugurated a dedicated facility for 100% neat SAF in April, with an initial production capacity of 1 million liters per day.

The company has signed agreements with local governments and food and beverage companies to collect used cooking oil as feedstock, while its subsidiary, BBGI (Bio-Based Green Innovation), is exploring algae-based SAF to diversify future sources.

PTT Global Chemical (PTTGC), the state-owned petroleum and LNG company, produced its first batch of SAF from used cooking oil in January and plans to expand production to 24 million litres per year in the future. The company has also formed strategic partnerships with Thai Airways and Bangkok Airways to collaborate on the research, development, and adoption of SAF.

Complementing these industry efforts, the Thai government has partnered with private and industrial sectors to strengthen the SAF supply chain. Six companies have joined the initiative, including Central Group, Thai Beverage, Charoen Pokphand Foods, Thai President Foods, the Thai Food Processors Association, and Bangchak Corporation.

Under the country’s Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP 2024), Thailand aims for 675 million liters of SAF consumption by 2037, equivalent to 1.85 million liters per day of neat SAF.

ASEAN joins the global push for SAF

The push for SAF is gaining momentum across ASEAN, with countries advancing at different stages of policy and market readiness. Singapore has emerged as the region’s frontrunner, combining clear policy targets with strategic industrial planning. On Oct. 14, the country passed the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill, paving the way for a green fuel levy on all departing passengers to ensure SAF makes up at least 1% of total jet fuel use by 2026.

Malaysia is another key player, leading the region with at least eight active projects in refinery construction and feedstock development. The country delivered its first locally blended SAF in September, marking the start of continuous, scalable production and targeting 1% SAF use by 2027.

Globally, the European Union has set one of the most ambitious benchmarks, mandating 6% SAF use by 2030 under the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative. Although SAF currently costs about three times more than fossil-based jet fuel, penalties for non-compliance are roughly three times the cost of compliance, according to an analysis by Carbon Direct, underscoring how seriously governments are enforcing these mandates.

As global momentum for decarbonization builds, Thailand is positioning itself to stay on board the global SAF transition. The country has an abundance of raw materials suitable for SAF production, supporting the government’s ambition to establish Thailand as a regional aviation hub, said Sarawut Kaewtathip, director-general of the Department of Energy Business.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is no longer a speculative solution—it’s now a strategic offering. For United Cargo, expanding access to SAF isn’t a side initiative, but the backbone of its commercial and environmental approach in Asia Pacific.

With the region’s freight volumes rising and regulatory pressure mounting, United is prioritising SAF engagement with enterprise shippers in Southeast Asia. “Our main priority is expanding access to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the most effective tool available today to reduce aviation emissions,” United Cargo told Air Cargo Week.

United’s sustainability pitch to its APAC customer base is grounded in operational tools, not vague targets. “Through United’s Eco-Skies Alliance, we give APAC-based customers the opportunity to participate directly in SAF purchases on both annual and multi-year agreements, allowing them to embed lower-carbon solutions into their supply chains”.

This direct purchasing model reflects growing demand from logistics buyers facing stricter emissions reporting and Scope 3 requirements. In parallel, United is backing SAF production itself. “At the same time, United Airlines Ventures, our corporate venture fund, is investing in innovative SAF producers and technologies, helping ensure that today’s commitments also build the future supply our industry needs.”

SAF access is just one part of a broader emissions strategy now embedded across the cargo business. “United Cargo has launched a dedicated sustainability group to drive progress across our operations. This team is fostering a culture of continuous improvement, advancing initiatives such as recycling programs, incorporating trucking emissions into our reporting, and embedding ESG requirements into our partnerships.”

The airline’s sustainability lens is both pragmatic and infrastructure-focused. “Our approach is both practical and forward-looking: scaling proven solutions like SAF and emissions transparency, while developing the culture, partnerships, and digital tools that will define the next generation of sustainable cargo.”

Southeast Asia network gains

United’s sustainability investments come as its physical footprint in Southeast Asia expands. The carrier is re-entering key offline markets and doubling down on existing ones. “United is continuing its expansion in Southeast Asia by introducing new and additional nonstop services to destinations such as Thailand, Vietnam, and further increasing its presence in the Philippines,” Mirco Renfer, Cargo VP APAC – United Airlines said.

“United is now resuming direct flights to Vietnam and Thailand, transitioning from being offline. Additionally, we are doubling our capacity with twice-daily flights to Manila, Philippines.”

Growth isn’t limited to Southeast Asia. “In Australia, United is launching a new flight to Adelaide from San Francisco on 11th December 2025,” the airline confirmed. Meanwhile, capacity is being adjusted across developed North Asian markets: “The focus remains on enhancing connectivity within Asia, ensuring the right capacity is allocated to key markets like Japan, where larger demand necessitates increased capacity.”

This expansion complements strong revenue performance across the region. “In 2025, United Cargo’s revenue rose 3.8 percent year-over-year. APAC is a large driver of that increase with the growth that the airline has seen across the Pacific region.”

The ramp-up of dedicated service reflects changing cargo patterns and demand. “Regardless of the size or cargo potential, the United network ensures representation and operations within the region.”

Freight mix shifting, ESG rising

The region’s freight profile is also evolving. “The primary drivers of demand in APAC include semiconductors, automotive devices, electronics, apparel, perishables, and most recently, lots of products for AI,” said Renfer.

These verticals, often under investor pressure to decarbonise, are likely to see growing alignment with SAF-based logistics solutions—particularly as international reporting frameworks tighten. United’s pitch is geared towards this shift, offering emissions reduction not just through operations, but through the productisation of SAF.

That approach may differentiate United in a field where many carriers still treat SAF as a long-term goal rather than a near-term deliverable.

The Chancery Court held, allowing the appeal on this point, that the application for relief from forfeiture had been made in time as required by section 146 of the Law of Property Act 1925 because it had been made after the possession order was made but before it was executed. However, the court dismissed the appeal overall on the basis that it was an abuse of process. Both Investments and Greenland, and the litigation were controlled by Mr Halabi and there was a pattern of abusive litigation to avoid paying sums owed and to keep the golf course. Investments was not an independent mortgagee protecting its rights and could have taken steps far earlier.

Insurance

In the context of claims for indemnification brought by Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Limited (“RSA”) under reinsurance policies against Equitas Insurance Limited (“Equitas”), the Commercial Court has provided guidance on the relationship between follow the settlements clauses and claims cooperation clauses. Both clauses are common in reinsurance policies. A claims cooperation clause requires the primary insurer (here RSA) to cooperate with the reinsurers (here Equitas) in respect of significant losses likely to fall under the reinsurance policy. A follow the settlement clause binds the reinsurers to follow the settlement agreed by the primary insurers. The court looked at the natural and ordinary meaning of the words and concluded that the two clauses could be read consistently with each other. Equitas was bound by the settlements under the primary policies, but in any event had agreed to the course RSA adopted. Further, it had failed to prove that RSA did not take proper and businesslike steps.

Costs

Following Nigeria’s successful application to set aside two arbitration awards made in favour of the appellant (“P&ID”), a costs order was made in Nigeria’s favour. P&ID challenged this order to the UK’s highest court on the basis that it should have been made in naira, Nigeria’s national currency, rather that in sterling. P&ID asserted that awarding the costs in sterling would give Nigeria a significant windfall given the fall in the value of the naira over the last few years. The Supreme Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts and confirmed that it was appropriate to award the costs in sterling. Nigeria’s lawyers had submitted invoices in sterling and been paid in that currency. The court emphasised the discretionary nature of an order for costs and its differences from an award of damages. It also highlighted that there were pragmatic reasons why the court did not investigate a party’s arrangements for funding litigation.",https://www.wfw.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Rolls-building_1282-x-598px.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 22:56:16.264628

Biofuels capacity growth slowed last year

Capacity growth for U.S. biofuel production slowed in 2024, the Energy Information Administration said in a report this week. It found that production capacity rose by a modest 3% from the start of 2024 to the start of 2025, based on the agency’s latest biofuels production capacity reports.

Most of the slowdown was due to a deceleration in production capacity in renewable diesel and other biofuels. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable naphtha, and renewable propane make virtually all other biofuels, the EIA said.

Production capacity for renewable diesel and other biofuels increased just 391 million gallons a year in 2024, less than a third of the growth seen in 2022 and 2023, the report said. Only two capacity additions came online in 2024, both in California: Phillips 66’s conversion of its Rodeo refinery to exclusively produce biofuels and a new Renewable Fuels LLC plant in Bakersfield. The conversion gave the Rodeo plant a capacity of 767 million gallons a year, up from 180 million the previous year, and makes it the second-largest renewable diesel plant in the U.S. after Diamond Green Diesel’s 982 million gallon-a-year plant in Norco, Louisiana.

Growth from the Rodeo expansion and the 138 million gallon-a-year Bakersfield plant was partially offset by the loss of capacity at four facilities, the EIA noted: Monroe Energy and Chevron stopped co-processing renewable diesel at their Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, refineries, respectively; Vertex Energy closed its Mobile, Alabama, plant and Jaxon Energy closed its Jackson, Mississippi facility.

The pace of capacity additions for U.S. biofuel production slowed sharply in 2024. According to the latest Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports, production capacity increased by only 3% from the start of 2024 to early 2025. The report covers every category of renewable diesel, biodiesel, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in the country.

EIA analysts said the slowdown was most noticeable in the renewable diesel and other biofuels category. Those two segments accounted for most of the reduced expansion seen last year. The “other biofuels” category includes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable naphtha, and renewable propane, which together make up virtually all additional biofuel types currently produced in the United States.

Renewable Diesel and Other Biofuels See Limited Growth

California Projects Dominate 2024 Capacity Additions

The EIA reported that renewable diesel and other biofuels production capacity rose by 391 million gallons per year (gal/y) in 2024. That increase was less than one-third of the growth recorded in 2022 and 2023. Only two projects came online during the year, both located in California: the Phillips 66 Rodeo refinery conversion and a new Renewable Fuels LLC facility in Bakersfield.

The Rodeo refinery underwent a complete conversion to produce only biofuels. Following the conversion, the plant’s capacity grew from 180 million gal/y to 767 million gal/y. This change elevated it to the second-largest renewable diesel facility in the United States, surpassed only by Diamond Green Diesel’s 982-million-gal/y plant in Norco, Louisiana.

However, those gains were partly offset by the loss of production capacity at four facilities nationwide. Monroe Energy and Chevron discontinued renewable diesel co-processing at their Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, refineries. In addition, Vertex Energy closed its plant in Mobile, Alabama, and Jaxon Energy shut down operations in Jackson, Mississippi.

EIA Data Sources and Market Forces Behind the Shift

Economic Margins and Refining Trends Drive Decisions

According to the EIA’s 2025 Fuel Ethanol Plant Production Capacity Report, 2025 Biodiesel Plant Production Capacity Report, and 2025 Renewable Diesel Fuel and Other Biofuels Plant Production Capacity Report, these changes reflect broader market forces that have evolved since 2020.

The loss of renewable diesel capacity at several facilities corresponds to fluctuating biofuel and petroleum refining margins. During 2020 and 2021, low refinery margins combined with high biofuel credit values spurred a wave of renewable diesel announcements. Companies rushed to convert or expand refineries to take advantage of the favorable economics.

As new plants entered production, the balance shifted. Biofuel output began to exceed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) target volumes, and both biofuel credit values and profit margins declined throughout 2023. Meanwhile, petroleum refinery margins strengthened from their 2020 lows. Those conditions prompted many refiners to slow or postpone investment in new renewable diesel projects in 2024 and beyond.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Emerges as a Priority

Refineries Shift Output Toward SAF

A notable trend in 2024 was the increased focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a renewable jet fuel alternative included in the “other biofuels” category. SAF, along with renewable heating oil, renewable gasoline, renewable naphtha, and renewable propane, represents the next phase of biofuel diversification.

The EIA groups SAF with renewable diesel because both are typically produced in the same facilities, either as byproducts or as replacement outputs when production lines shift from renewable diesel to SAF.

Following completion of the conversion projects in 2024, Phillips 66’s Rodeo plant gained the flexibility to shift about 150 million gal/y of renewable diesel capacity to SAF production. Likewise, Diamond Green Diesel’s Louisiana plant can divert approximately 235 million gal/y to SAF.

These capacity adjustments reflect the growing recognition that SAF offers significant growth potential as the aviation industry faces rising carbon reduction mandates and seeks scalable low-emission fuel options.

Biodiesel Capacity Contracts While Ethanol Expands

Biodiesel Declines Due to Tight Margins

Alongside renewable diesel’s slowdown, the U.S. biodiesel industry also contracted in 2024. EIA data showed that eight biodiesel plants closed during the year because of poor margins, eliminating about 100 million gal/y of capacity. This marks one of the largest single-year declines in biodiesel history and underscores how volatile feedstock prices and weaker Renewable Identification Number (RIN) values have pressured profitability.

Fuel Ethanol Growth Outpaces Other Biofuels

In contrast, fuel ethanol capacity expanded more in 2024 than in the prior two years combined. Ethanol now accounts for 73% of total U.S. biofuels capacity, reaching nearly 18.5 billion gal/y. Most ethanol plants remain concentrated in Midwestern states, particularly Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, and Minnesota, where corn serves as the dominant feedstock.

Although domestic ethanol consumption has stayed relatively stable, the EIA said the new capacity primarily supports export growth. Foreign demand—especially from Canada, Brazil, and Asia—continues to drive shipments of U.S. ethanol as global markets seek lower-carbon fuel blending components.

Biofuel Industry Outlook for 2025

EIA analysts expect modest capacity growth to continue in 2025, particularly for SAF and renewable diesel projects already under construction. Future expansion will depend heavily on policy support, including federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, and on global demand for low-carbon transportation fuels.

While the sector’s 2024 slowdown reflects near-term market corrections, the long-term outlook for biofuels in the U.S. energy transition remains positive, driven by ongoing technology advances and federal decarbonization targets.",,N,,2025-10-28 19:00:21.812625

80M Assumes 100% Ownership of Hydrogen Valley:

The Company and Hydrogen Valley (""HV"") have agreed to revised terms (""Revised Terms"") to the acquisition agreement announced 19th December 2024 (https://80mile.com/regulatory-news/75603) governing the Ferrandina ownership structure. Under the new arrangement, 80 Mile will increase its interest in HV to 100%. Further details to the Revised Terms are noted below.

New MOUs:

Strategic MOU with Fortune 500 Energy Company:

In a landmark step, the Company's 100%-owned Greenswitch Srl (""Greenswitch"") has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"") with one of the World's largest integrated energy companies (the ""Group""), a publicly listed business ranked in the top 10% of the Fortune 500. This entity is a globally recognised, vertically integrated, leader in refining, petrochemicals and logistics.

Under the terms of the MOU, the Group will supply up to 80,000 tonnes per annum (""tpa"") of renewable feedstocks to the Ferrandina plant beginning 1 November 2025. These will include Palm Oil Methyl Ester (""POME""), both crude and refined, as well as Repurposed Used Cooking Oil (""RUCO""), delivered to the port of Taranto, approximately 70 kilometres (""km"") from the facility.

This guaranteed supply strengthens Ferrandina's commercial model, ensuring reliable input for the production of biodiesel and SAF while positioning Greenswitch as a cornerstone in Europe's transition to low-carbon energy.

Tolling MOU with Ludoil Energia - 50% of Plant Capacity Secured:

Greenswitch has signed an MOU with Ludoil Energia S.r.l. (""Ludoil""), based in Civitavecchia, Italy.

The agreement sets the framework for a biodiesel tolling arrangement, under which Ludoil will provide feedstock and HV will generate revenue solely from processing.

No upfront feedstock purchases are required, eliminating working capital risk.

The tolling structure is estimated to generate approximately €8 million net profit per year for HV. The other 50% of the capacity is estimated to be double that for total of €24 million net (assuming full production)

The MOU provides for:

Plant restart planned for December 2025 with full production in January 2026

Annual quantities: 80,000 tpa of biodiesel in the short term, and 40,000 tpa of SAF longer term

With 80,000 tpa already secured under this tolling framework, Ludoil alone covers 50% of the Ferrandina plant's permitted 150,000 tpa capacity, giving the Company clear revenue visibility and validating the site's strategic importance.

MOU with JEnergy S.p.A

Hydrogen Valley has also signed an MOU with JEnergy S.p.A (""JEnergy""), headquartered in Rome, Italy.

Short-term framework for the supply of biodiesel and bioliquids

Longer-term discussions on SAF and HVO supply

Supply schedule:

Start of biodiesel supply: January 2026

SAF/HVO supply: 2027 onwards

Annual agreed quantities: 10,000 tpa of biodiesel, additional bioliquids, and longer-term cooperation on SAF and HVO

Previously Announced MOUs:

NACATA Commodities

80M signed an MOU with NACATA Commodities as announced on 30 July 2025 (""NACATA""), a leading renewable energy distributor, covering:

Up to 120,000 tpa of feedstock supply

Offtake of resulting products: 40,000 tpa of esterified bioliquid and 80,000 tpa of biodiesel

Initial term: 5 years

Tecnoparco Valbasento

Greenswitch has also signed an MOU with Tecnoparco Valbasento (""Tecnoparco"") for the procurement of up to 40,000 tpa of biofuel from Greenswitch, for use in its cogeneration units.

The agreement would shorten Tecnoparco's supply chain, reduce shipping costs, and improve sustainability credentials by moving away from palm oil imports. The initial 40,000 tpa could increase if Tecnoparco's affiliate industrial operators are included.

About 80 Mile Plc:

80 Mile Plc, listed on the London AIM market under the ticker 80M, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and the U.S. OTC Market under the ticker BLLYF, is an exploration and development company focused on high-grade critical metals in Tier 1 jurisdictions. With multiple projects in Greenland, as well as a developing industrial gas and biofuels business in Italy, 80 Mile offers both portfolio and commodity diversification focused on base metals, precious metals, and industrial gas while expanding into sustainable fuels and clean energy solutions in Tier 1 jurisdictions. 80 Mile's strategy is centred on advancing key projects while creating value through partnerships and strategic acquisitions.

80 Mile's acquisition of White Flame Energy and the Jameson licenses in East Greenland has positioned the Company in one of the world's most compelling undrilled hydrocarbon basins. Under its agreement with March GL, drilling of two fully funded wells is set to commence, with Pelican Acquisition Corporation's merger with Greenland Exploration valuing 80 Mile's retained 30% interest in Jameson at approximately US$92 million. This acquisition and partnership significantly expand 80 Mile's exposure to the energy sector while advancing its strategy of developing both conventional and sustainable energy opportunities.

The Disko-Nuussuaq nickel-copper-cobalt-PGE project in Greenland is a primary focus for 80 Mile, 100% owned by 80 Mile PLC. Seven priority targets exhibiting spatial characteristics indicative of potential deposits on a scale comparable to renowned mining operations such as Norilsk, Voisey's Bay, and Jinchuan, will be advanced by the Company.

The Dundas Ilmenite Project, 80 Mile's most advanced asset in northwest Greenland, is fully with a JORC-compliant Mineral Resource of 117 Mt at 6.1% ilmenite and an offshore Exploration Target of up to 530 Mt. Dundas is poised to become a major supplier of high-quality ilmenite. Recent discoveries of hard rock titanium mineralisation, with bedrock samples showing nearly double the ilmenite content of previous estimates, further enhance the project's world-class potential. 80 Mile owns 100% of the Dundas Ilmenite Project under its subsidiary Dundas Titanium A/S in Greenland.

80 Mile PLC has executed an asset purchase agreement with Amaroq Minerals Ltd. (AIM, TSXV, NASDAQ Iceland: AMRQ) to divest its 100% interest in the Kangerluarsuk zinc-lead-silver project in Greenland. Under the terms of the agreement, 80 Mile will receive US$500,000 in Amaroq shares upon completion, with a further US$1,500,000 payable in cash or shares upon the discovery of an economic deposit, defined by a JORC or NI 43-101 compliant resource that supports development.

The inaugural Contrails Analysis Report urges business aviation to modify flight plans to minimise contrails and airlines to publish similar studies.","Ensuring a cleaner, more sustainable business aviation industry means taking greater investment risks with technologies and new enterprises to lower emissions, according to research from University College Dublin Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School.

“Showing that the [business aviation] industry is serious about decarbonisation will make business aviation operators more appealing to lenders, allowing banks and financiers to be able to point to a reduction in emissions from the sector,” Thomas Conlon, professor of Finance from UCD Smurfit School told CJI. “In turn this allows financiers to continue to support the industry. This may help an industry which is prone to market cycles.”

While developing and adopting greener solutions in aviation is risky and expensive, the research reveals that smarter ways of managing investment risk could speed up the shift towards cleaner air travel and other hard-to-decarbonise sectors.

“The technology to support clean aviation exists, but it requires a new way of framing the relationship between risk, return and sustainability,” said Conlon. “Capital needs to flow towards risky innovations that will really move the dial in terms of deep decarbonisation.”

Help investors

To help achieve that progress, Conlon and colleagues have devised a new tool called an Aviation Sustainability Index (ASI), This is a quantitative method to assess how different technologies or investments could help decouple emissions from growth in air travel. The approach is designed to help investors distinguish between projects that only modestly improve efficiency and those that could significantly transform the sector’s climate impact.

Colon said: “The proposed ASI provides a greenwashing resistant way to underpin sustainability linked financing to the sector, allowing investors to identify innovations will truly move the dial.”

It’s a tool that could prove particularly useful for business aviation as scrutiny of its emissions record intensifies. “Regulators may, in future, see this as a low hanging fruit to reduce the overall contribution of emissions to climate change,” Colon told us. “By adopting the approach outlined in this paper, the business aviation sector can quantify and point to success in decarbonisation while also allowing them to obtain capital to support the carbon-neutral growth of the industry.

About $1trn is expected to be invested in aviation over the next decade, with most of that money targetted at making aircraft slightly more efficient, according to the report’s authors Few investors have clear incentives to back the kind of breakthrough technologies, such as hydrogen propulsion, advanced aircraft designs, or large-scale sustainable fuel systems, that could substantially reduce emissions, they claim.

Reduce contrails

Business aviation operators could commit to purchasing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and to demanding more fuel-efficient aircraft from OEMs, said Colon. Another, potentially easy, lever available to business operators is to understand and reduce the contrails associated with these aircraft, which may be a low-cost way to reduce climate impact.

The research report’s co-author, David G Victor, professor of Innovation and Public Policy from the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy said: “Cleaner flight is possible, but it requires changing how we think about both risk and return. We need new institutions, incentives, and partnerships that reward innovation, not just incrementalism.”

Developing better tools to test climate-friendly investments and rewarding companies to take calculated risks on breakthrough technologies, governments, investors and industry leaders can accelerate real progress toward decarbonisation, conclude the researchers.

The use of agricultural byproducts and waste fats supports the concept of a circular economy—transforming waste into high-value, sustainable fuel.","Montana Renewables (MRL), a key player in North America’s low-carbon fuel market and a subsidiary of Calumet Inc., announced the successful commissioning and launch of its new blended Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) product, MaxSAF Blended. Developed in collaboration with Calumet Montana Refining, the new product is a nominal 50/50 blend of renewable jet fuel and traditional fossil jet fuel.

The blended fuel meets the rigorous aviation industry standards, certified under both ASTM D7566 (for the synthetic paraffinic kerosene component) and ASTM D1655 specifications, confirming its drop-in compatibility with all existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure. This eliminates the need for modifications to aircraft engines or airport facilities, overcoming a major logistical hurdle for SAF adoption.

Montana Renewables and Calumet Montana Refining have commissioned dedicated onsite blending and shipping facilities at the Great Falls complex to manage the production and logistics of MaxSAF. The finished product will initially be distributed through the extensive network of AEG Fuels, targeting select aviation hubs in Montana, Washington, and Oregon.

""AEG Fuels is honored to collaborate with Montana Renewables on this landmark SAF inaugural blend,"" stated Landon Larson, Vice President, Supply NA at AEG Fuels. ""Together, we're demonstrating how strategic partnerships can accelerate the transition to sustainable aviation and deliver real value to operators across our fueling network.""

The distribution model focuses on providing a drop-in fuel solution that helps regional customers immediately begin working toward their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) targets and reduce both Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 3 (value chain) emissions.

MaxSAF is positioned as a triple-benefit product for the aviation sector.

• For Montana Renewables: Sales from the truck rack open up regional service opportunities and new customer segments in the sustainable aviation market, extending the reach of their Great Falls operations. MRL's feedstocks, which include agricultural byproducts like tallow, distiller’s corn oil, canola, used cooking oil, and camelina oil sourced from Pacific Northwest farms, contribute to the regional economic impact.

• For Customers: It provides an immediate, practical solution for airlines and operators to meet their carbon reduction goals and enhance their brand leadership in sustainability without incurring capital costs for infrastructure changes.

• For the Environment: SAF significantly reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional Jet A fuel and also offers improvements in local air quality.

The fuel is delivered to each airport via existing pipeline infrastructure from Neste’s SAF terminal facilities in Houston.

“Introducing sustainable aviation fuel for the first time at our hubs in Houston, Newark, and Dulles is another significant milestone in United’s sustainability journey,” said United Chief Sustainability Officer Lauren Riley in a statement. “While United remains the leading SAF user in the U.S., using over 4,300 metric tons (13 million gallons) last year, we recognize that the growth of the SAF market requires support from both state and federal governments. We will continue collaborating with stakeholders, like Neste, across the aviation value chain to encourage policymakers to implement sensible market incentives that promote lower-carbon energy.”

Neste has been supplying SAF to United at Chicago O’Hare International Airport since August 2024, after the SAF purchase credit was enacted in Illinois, making United the first airline to use SAF at the airport.

The company said the technology enables cost-effective production of “drop-in” fuels that meet existing performance and infrastructure requirements.

Honeywell said its approach produces “high-yield renewable fuels” while keeping transportation costs low by enabling distributed feedstock conversion and centralized refining.
Competition in a crowded field The announcement places Honeywell squarely in competition with a growing roster of renewable-fuel technology developers.","Honeywell has introduced a new process to convert agricultural and forestry waste into renewable fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The US company describes it as a technological breakthrough and a major step toward lowering carbon emissions in hard-to-decarbonize industries such as aviation and shipping.

Announced on October 28, 2025, the new Honeywell UOP (Universal Oil Products) Biocrude Upgrading process transforms inexpensive biomass feedstocks — such as wood chips, crop residues, and plant waste — into a renewable biocrude that can be refined into finished fuels. The company said the technology enables cost-effective production of “drop-in” fuels that meet existing performance and infrastructure requirements.

Honeywell described the process as capable of producing SAF, renewable gasoline, and lower-carbon marine fuel more cheaply than most current biofuel production. The resulting biocrude can be refined at standard petroleum facilities, potentially allowing refiners to adapt portions of existing operations to produce renewable fuel without major equipment overhauls.

“As demand for SAF continues to grow, the aviation industry is challenged by limited supplies of traditional SAF feedstocks such as vegetable oils, animal fats and waste oils,” said Ken West, President & CEO of Honeywell Energy & Sustainability Solutions. “When combined with the existing Fischer-Tropsch process, our new technology will expand the feedstock options available in the industry to sources that are more plentiful, ultimately helping improve our customers’ ability to produce SAF.”

The process begins with biomass waste — non-food organic matter such as forest trimmings, agricultural stalks, and sawmill residue. At or near collection sites, this feedstock is converted into a biocrude, a heavy renewable oil with similar handling properties to conventional crude. The biocrude is then shipped to major refineries or renewable fuel plants, where Honeywell’s upgrading modules convert it into finished products such as SAF, the company said.

The process turns waste that would otherwise be discarded into fuel, creating a new renewable source without relying on food crops. Honeywell said its approach produces “high-yield renewable fuels” while keeping transportation costs low by enabling distributed feedstock conversion and centralized refining.

Competition in a crowded field

The announcement places Honeywell squarely in competition with a growing roster of renewable-fuel technology developers. Neste, based in Finland, remains the world’s leading SAF producer, using waste oils and fats as feedstock. LanzaJet, backed by LanzaTech and major airlines, has pioneered ethanol-to-jet conversion at its Freedom Pines facility in Georgia. Other competitors include Fulcrum BioEnergy, which converts municipal solid waste into synthetic crude, and Alder Fuels, which relies on forest residues and agricultural by-products.

Honeywell’s claim of a lower-cost, modular process could differentiate it from these players, particularly if it enables refiners to add SAF capacity incrementally rather than through billion-dollar plant builds. The company emphasized that its UOP division — long a cornerstone of refining and petrochemical process technology — can deliver the new system as a prefabricated modular plant, reducing construction time and project risk.

Honeywell already markets several renewable-fuel technologies, including Ecofining, developed jointly with Eni S.p.A., which converts fats and oils into renewable diesel and SAF; Ethanol-to-Jet (ETJ) technology, which upgrades ethanol into synthetic paraffinic kerosene; and Fischer-Tropsch Unicracking, which refines synthetic gas into liquid fuels. The new Biocrude Upgrading process, the company said, complements these existing platforms by expanding the range of usable feedstocks to include low-cost lignocellulosic biomass.

While the company has not disclosed specific yields or lifecycle carbon data, analysts say the modular design and ability to use regional feedstocks could make the process a breakthrough for SAF scalability — a persistent challenge for the industry. Current global SAF production represents less than 1% of aviation fuel demand, hindered by high costs, limited feedstock supply, and the need for new refining capacity.

If Honeywell’s process performs as claimed, it could give refiners and energy companies a new pathway to produce certified SAF at lower cost and higher volume, supporting airline commitments to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/06/Aircraft-fueling-process.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 14:56:31.322690

Honeywell tech could boost maritime decarbonisation drive

Honeywell is launching a new technology that can convert forest and agricultural waste to a lower carbon fuel that could directly replace the carbon-intensive fuel oil used by large ships, helping the maritime and other heavy industries decarbonise.

The US industrial group told Energy Source that the “biocrude upgrading technology” can use biomass, which includes agricultural waste, to create a range of renewable fuels including, sustainable aviation fuel, gasoline, diesel and marine fuel.

Honeywell’s new technology could be a game-changer for the maritime industry. It can produce a direct replacement to heavy fuel oil since it has a high enough energy density to power ships on long voyages around the world.

Ken West, president and chief executive of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, told Energy Source that the fuel is compatible with existing engines and can utilise a wide range of biomass feedstocks.

The announcement comes as the shipping industry faces growing pressure to decarbonise. According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, shipping is responsible for 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and is reliant on one of the dirtiest fuels: heavy fuel oil.

The industry is working towards decarbonisation and the International Maritime Organization has said it aims to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by or around 2050.

Danish shipping company Maersk, which operates in almost 130 countries, hopes to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. CMA CGM, a French shipping company, plans to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 and 80 per cent by 2040.

Honeywell Energy’s West added that the fuel can help ship owners meet guidelines for reducing carbon emissions because it does not require them to commit to major capital upgrades in order to decarbonise.

Shipping is a global business and fleets typically refuel at ports across the world, making acquiring sustainable fuels at ports in a variety of countries crucial.

“Biomass can be found in many different areas and we can use this technology particularly in countries that may not have access to fossil fuels or may not have access to other forms of renewable power,” West said. “I think we’re going to have customers that are truly going to be global.”

Still, cost remains a barrier for the maritime sector’s transition to renewable fuel. Pure biofuel is about $1,100 to $1,300 a ton, which is roughly 2 to 2.5 times the cost of fuel oil, according to Aparajit Pandey, a principal in the Rocky Mountain Institute’s climate-aligned industries group. He added that as biofuel becomes more popular, the jump in demand could also raise prices.

“Any fuel for maritime is going to be expensive. This is a fuel that is going to be pretty expensive to start off with and will get more expensive over time,” he said.

Biomass is also not abundantly available and some experts have warned that unsustainable management of this resource could lead to deforestation and biodiversity loss.

Still, West at Honeywell Energy said that renewable fuel would not necessarily replace other energy sources but would be simply an addition.

“We’re going to require biomass . . . and we’re going to require transition technologies like liquefied natural gas,” he said. “We know the world needs more energy tomorrow than it needs today. And that’s going to take a number of different technologies to get there.” (Alexandra White)

Zinc mine hosts the ‘world’s deepest marathon’

Dozens of runners from around the world descended 1,120 meters below sea level at the weekend to run what is expected to be confirmed as the world’s deepest marathon.

The race, held in Swedish mining group Boliden’s Garpenberg zinc mine, saw 55 people don high-vis T-shirts, helmets and head torches and run for hours around a 4km circuit in near darkness in the hope of raising more than $1mn for charity.

The runners — including Boliden chief executive Mikael Staffas, Rohitesh Dhawan, the chief executive of the International Council on Mining and Metals, and Jonathan Price, the boss of Canadian miner Teck Resources — endured subterranean temperatures in the mid 20s Celsius and high humidity.

“Without the head torch, you wouldn’t have seen anything,” said Staffas, who successfully completed the race alongside the other 54 runners.

The circuit was located in the lower part of the zinc mine, in an “exploration drift”, a tunnel built for underground drilling teams to explore the earth and rock further below them.

Getting there required taking a lift down 1km — an ear-popping two-minute journey — and then a 10-minute underground minibus to the race’s starting line.

The slowest runner completed the race in under eight hours, with regular marathon runners saying the challenging conditions added about an hour to their normal times.

“I’ve run 15 marathons and this was by far the hardest,” said Dhawan. “You go through every emotion. You go to a pretty dark place because you’re alone with your thoughts in a dark tunnel.” But he added that it had been a “once in a lifetime” experience.

About $570,000 has been raised so far for the BecomingX Foundation, an educational charity, and Wild at Heart Foundation, which aims to reduce the world’s stray dog population. (Camilla Hodgson)

Established in 1995 as Jet Aviation’s first location in Asia, the site has grown into a key center for maintenance, refurbishment, modification and aircraft services.

The facility was officially launched at the Singapore Airshow in 1996 and has since expanded in line with regional growth in business aviation. “I am incredibly proud to celebrate this milestone in Singapore,” said Jeremie Caillet, president, Jet Aviation. “When we first arrived in 1995, business aviation in the region was in its infancy. Singapore has since developed into an important hub for travel across Asia and beyond. Over the decades, we have evolved our services to support this growth, combining our global expertise with local insight to provide a seamless customer experience.”

In recent years, Jet Aviation Singapore has continued to invest in its capabilities and infrastructure. The site extended FBO services to Changi Airport in 2006, opened a 5,000m² (53,820ft²) maintenance hangar in 2014 and a third 3,850m² (41,440ft²) hangar in 2017. In 2023, the FBO introduced on-site sustainable aviation fuel in partnership with FlyORO, and in late 2024, achieved IS-BAH Stage 3 accreditation.

This year, Jet Aviation Singapore joined the Airbus Corporate Jets Service Center Network as its third facility worldwide and the only one in the Asia-Pacific region. The site also underwent an interior renovation, adding 15 new customer offices and meeting rooms, alongside upgrades to reception and crew lounge areas.

“In the past three decades, we have grown to become a leading provider of MRO and FBO services in APAC, and none of this would have been possible without the passion and dedication of our employees,” said Louis Leong, vice president, MRO operations Asia. “Their commitment to providing safe, seamless and personalized service has made us who we are today. I would like to thank our employees, customers and partners for their ongoing support as we look forward to the future.”

To commemorate its 30th anniversary, Jet Aviation is hosting a series of events throughout October at its Singapore site, bringing together customers, partners and employees.

I’m having minor surgery this week. After cataract surgery in both eyes more than 10 years ago, my left eye was sharp, bright, and clear — and still is. My right eye was blurry — and still is.

I’ve waited much too long to get this issue addressed. I thought, “It’s not that big a deal. My left eye is perfect!”

Poor vision inhibits confidence and erodes prompt, aligned action. So this week I’m having YAG laser surgery. It’s quick (literally a couple of minutes) and typical results are fantastic.

Business leaders face similar challenges with poor vision. If leaders don’t pay attention to how formal leaders treat employees each day, those business leaders won’t see the negative impact such treatment has on results and respect.

Here’s an example. A client had been coaching a middle manager who supervised a remote office. That manager wasn’t modeling the organization’s values and behaviors. He was rude, dismissive and abrupt with staff members. Complaints continued, including from customers, about this manager’s rude behavior.

The CEO told us, “We thought everything was doing fine. We didn’t keep an eye on this leader.” They realized that they had been hoping things were okay rather than consistently observing, monitoring and measuring the quality of interactions by this middle manager.

How can leaders stay “in tune” with how formal leaders treat others?

One client created an effective system to keep abreast of good things happening and of less-than-good things happening. Every email that goes out has a “tell us how we’re doing” link, which opens a simple contact form on their website. Customers and staff members can post feedback — and they do.

The administration team reviews all submissions. When positive recognition is posted, that team shares the good news with the staff member — or the team being praised — and their team leader. When missed deadlines or frustrations are shared, that team shares the issue with the staff member or team and their team lead.

This low-tech system works because it’s easy — customers and employees can post items from their phones — and because real humans respond promptly and effectively.

Every formal leader must champion your organization’s desired work culture every day, in every interaction. How can leaders know if respect and validation are communicated effectively? By keeping an eye on customer and employee perceptions.

BlueLight launches first humanitarian airline

BlueLight Humanitarian Airlines (BlueLight) has officially taken off as the world’s first non-profit airline devoted to humanitarian missions. Based in Geneva, the hub of global aid diplomacy, the airline aims to fill a long-standing gap in crisis response — rapid, neutral, and affordable air transport for relief operations.

Its fleet will unite cargo, passenger, and air ambulance functions under one system. Each aircraft can carry more than 50 tonnes of aid, transport 200 responders, and operate as a flying trauma unit. Co-founder Pierre Bernheim says the airline was built to end dangerous delays in crisis relief, stressing that speed and neutrality are vital when lives hang in the balance.

BlueLight’s initial fleet will include Airbus A340-300 and A321P2F aircraft. It also plans an uncrewed aerial system capable of flying 800 kilometres with 500 kg of supplies, designed for regions where runways are inaccessible.

Co-founder Waleed Rawat describes BlueLight as “a humanitarian infrastructure for the 21st century,” combining the efficiency of commercial aviation with the compassion of aid work.

The founders bring deep aviation and leadership expertise. Bernheim previously led Geneva Airport and advised at Vontobel Bank, while Rawat, head of WAIR Global and part of the HM Rawat Group, has wide experience in aviation and sustainable ventures. Together, they have assembled an international team of aviation, medical, and humanitarian professionals.

BlueLight plans full-scale operations by 2026, after raising US$55 million to acquire and convert three wide-body aircraft. Backed by the Swiss Federal Government and the Canton of Geneva, the project has also drawn partners such as Airbus, Geneva Airport, and JORAMCO.

Operating on a fixed-rate, transparent model, BlueLight promises fair access for all relief partners. The airline also integrates sustainable aviation fuel and carbon offsets from the start, aligning with UN and Swiss sustainability goals.

The ReFuelEU Aviation Annual Technical Report found that 0.6% of Europe’s supplied aviation fuel for 2024 was SAF. This percentage needs to increase rapidly, but nevertheless saved 714 kilotonnes of carbon emissions, the equivalent of around 10,000 flights between Madrid and Paris.

Overall, EASA believes the EU is on track to achieve its 6% blending target in the next five years. Whether the bloc hits its interim target of 2% SAF in 2025 will be assessed at the close of this calendar year.

China is Europe’s biggest supplier of biofuel

EASA’s findings also highlight the ongoing cost obstacles to SAF adoption. Currently, the average price of SAF sits at €2,085/tonne, compared to €734/tonne for conventional jet fuel. Until the cost becomes more competitive, it is difficult to see how SAF use can scale successfully. Earlier this year, Airlines for Europe (A4E) criticised the EU for imposing SAF mandates without taking action to create a viable SAF market. Nevertheless, EASA’s report affirms progress on the 6% target.

Europe’s biggest producer of SAF is currently Finland, responsible for 10% of supply. However, 69% of feedstock originates outside of the EU, with China the biggest supplier.

Maria Rueda, EASA’s safety management, sustainability and global outreach director, said:

This first annual technical report marks an important milestone and makes clear that the EU has taken important first steps.

A functioning reporting system is now in place, initial reporting compliance levels are solid, and SAF delivery is happening across multiple member states. This report sets an important benchmark for our sustainability efforts in the future.

NASA and Lockheed Martin’s Palmdale facility are teaming up to develop the X-59. The jet is designed to tackle one of supersonic flight’s long-standing challenges: the loud sonic boom. By separating shockwaves, the X-59 is capable of producing a much softer sonic “thump,” potentially paving the way for future commercial supersonic flights over populated areas.

NASA will collect data from communities about the acceptability of the jet’s noise. The results could help inform new regulations that might one day allow passengers to travel long distances much faster than current commercial aircraft permit.

“We’re honored that Californians chose the X-59 as the Coolest Thing Made in California,” Patrick LeBeau, X-59 program manager, said in a statement. “This recognition celebrates the groundbreaking technology and precision engineering behind the X-59, and the incredible dedication of our Palmdale team and partners. We thank CMTA and everyone who voted for helping shine a spotlight on California’s world-class manufacturing.”

The contest drew over 200,000 votes across four rounds. Other finalists included Siemens’ Amtrak Airo Trainset, produced in Sacramento; Phillips 66’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel from Rodeo; and Saildrone’s Voyager, made in Alameda.

California is home to one-third of the nation’s space technology companies and has more aerospace engineers and defense personnel than any other state, according to the Governor’s Office. Overall, more than 45,000 manufacturing establishments operate in California, employing over 1.24 million residents across a range of sectors such as aerospace, clean tech, life sciences and high-tech manufacturing.",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/84xw1s/picture312669136/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/P25-056-09~large.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 13:01:47.213928

With mounting pressure to decarbonize and a growing demand for sustainable supply chains, India’s logistics sector is undergoing a sideways shift. The sector aims to integrate sustainability into daily operations, while shaping the future of freight through strategic direction for green logistics in the country.

Green and digital corridors have been hailed as engines of economic growth, innovation, and sustainability as they accelerate the adoption of low-emission technologies, transform maritime operations, and strengthen digital tools. The India-Singapore Green and Digital Shipping Corridor is an important leverage for India as it builds bilateral relationships and establishes global trade dynamics that are green and sustainable.

Promoting Sustainable Logistics Through Technology

Recognising the importance of sustainable logistics for India’s environmental well-being and economic growth, several initiatives have been taken by the Government. The Government is promoting a sustainable logistics industry by leveraging digitization and automation.

The PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan (PMGS- NMP) relies on the GIS-based platform that uses geospatial data for better infrastructure planning and creating multimodal connectivity across the lengths and breadths of the country.

Similarly, the National Logistics Plan (NLP) aims to modernize logistics through adoption of digital technology. Digital platforms like Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) and Logistics Data Bank (LDB) are being increasingly used for digitalizing, tracking, and monitoring of logistics movement in the country.

The Freight Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Calculator is a digital intervention that has been created to promote sustainability in the freight transport planning process and shift to low-carbon modes of transport. It helps the user make an informed modal choice based on the environmental cost and total emissions estimates to advance sustainable and green logistics in India.

Use of Cleaner Fuels

Sustainability in the transport sector is largely driven by green fuel such as green hydrogen, methanol, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) , along with other blended fuel.

Under The National Green Hydrogen Mission, the government has initiated a pilot project to use hydrogen in buses, trucks and other commercially viable modes for utilizing hydrogen into transport sector and adding supporting infrastructure like hydrogen refuelling stations.

Initiatives like Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) promotes compressed biogas (CBG) as an alternative green transport fuel as it is based out of organic waste and also helps in efficient management of biomass.

India is also targeting 1% blending by 2027, 2% by 2028 and 5% by 2030 in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as mandated by The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). CORSIA. With more than 750 million metric tonnes of available biomass and 230 million metric tonnes of surplus agricultural residues, India has the capacity to meet its SAF demand as well as emerge as a global leader and exporter for carbon offsetting in the aviation industry.

M-15 fuel blending (15 % methanol and 85 % Gasoline) has also shown a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by about 5- 10% thereby improving air quality.

Building A Green Shipping & Maritime Sector

Sustainability in logistics cannot be achieved by focusing only on road or air transport. A green shipping and maritime sector forms an important part of India’s international decarbonisation goal and achieving IMO’s 2023 Revised GHG Strategy.

Sustainable maritime practices through initiatives like the Green Tug Transition Programme and Harid Nauka Initiative focus on adopting low-emission and alternative fuel-powered ships. The Alang Ship Recycling Programme is another global effort in sustainable ship recycling. With ₹25,000 crore in Maritime Development Fund, India is also catalysing green investments, positioning itself as a leader in sustainable shipping and maritime infrastructure.

Furthermore, the Maritime India Vision 2030 is a comprehensive framework for the holistic development of India’s maritime sector through focus on innovation, sustainability, and skill development. It aims to develop ports, shipping, and waterways aimed to propel India to global maritime leadership. This expansion aligns seamlessly with the broader aspiration of Viksit Bharat 2047, contributing to employment generation, global competitiveness, and economic resilience.

Propelling the Green Engine in Railways

Railways is another sector which has immense potential for transforming the sustainability and environmental landscape of India. Government initiatives like National Rail Plan and Rail Sagar Corridor aim to improve freight share from the current 35-36% to 45% by 2030. It also aims to improve modal shift for railways, contribute to cleaner ways of freight movement and accelerate growth of railways cargo traffic.

Addressing Key Barriers

As we transition to modes of transport that emit lower carbon and are less harmful to the environment, there are also some systemic and infrastructural barriers that have to be addressed collectively by the industry and the Government. One of the key barriers to this is infrastructure, especially for alternative fuels.

There is a need for LNG infrastructure and implementing green channelling initiatives that strengthen the entire logistics sector. Another key factor for the green freight landscape is driver training. With properly trained drivers, we can better fuel mileage and efficiency as these are newer vehicles and roads for the drivers.

As the transport sector moves towards EVs, there is also a need to use renewable energy for the purpose of charging these new vehicles for personal, commercial, and transport purposes.",https://ciiblog.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cover-25-Oct-The-Future-Of-Green-Freight-In-India-01.png,N,,2025-10-28 11:57:40.484580

It empowers conference attendees to calculate and address their aviation-related emissions by supporting SAF meeting SABA’s world-leading sustainability criteria - directly engaging in real-world deployment of a crucial decarbonization technology.

SABA’s COP30 SAFc platform gives conference-goers all the resources they need to decarbonize their COP air travel. Attendees first estimate their flight emissions using one of two methods. For commercial flights, travelers will use Google’s Travel Impact Model, an industry-leading calculation tool, while travelers on private jets will use the Eurocontrol Small Emitters Tool. Next, attendees purchase a corresponding quantity of high-integrity SAF certificates pre-vetted by SABA; and later receive a retirement statement from the SAFc Registry, which ensures the transaction meets best-in-class chain of custody requirements. The platform supports those traveling via commercial and private aircraft – crucial flexibility given that as many as 65 private jets travel to COP in a given year.

The high-integrity SAF supported through the new platform is sourced from SkyNRG as the result of a streamlined, competitive procurement process initiated by SABA earlier this year.

The Asia-Pacific region has fundamentally shifted its approach to sustainable aviation fuel over the past year. Since 2024, multiple APAC governments have moved from tentative goals to concrete blending targets and mandates. Japan is finalising a 10% SAF mandate by 2030, India has set targets starting in 2027, and several Southeast Asian nations (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand) have introduced SAF blending roadmaps beginning around 2027. Singapore stands out with a confirmed near-term goal of 1% SAF by 2026, potentially rising to 3-5% by 2030, making it an early adopter in the region. In short, 2025 is the year APAC moved from aspiration to action on SAF policy, laying the regulatory groundwork that was largely missing in 2024.

APAC's SAF production capacity has grown and diversified since last year. The region is now home to one of the world's largest SAF production hubs: Neste's expanded Singapore refinery, which began pumping out SAF in commercial volumes and supplying carriers and logistics companies in the region. New domestic production projects have been announced or advanced in multiple countries. Australia is pursuing its first commercial SAF plants (one project in Queensland aims to produce around 100 million litres per year from ethanol by 2026-2027, backed by Qantas, Airbus and government funding), and Japan's major energy firms have completed pilot facilities for synthetic e-fuels. In China, state-owned producers achieved initial SAF outputs and the government set a 50,000-tonne SAF production target by 2025. Regional supply chains are also maturing: airlines like All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines in late 2024 began using domestically-blended SAF on commercial flights for the first time, and Hong Kong saw its first large corporate SAF purchase (3,400 tonnes by HSBC/Cathay Pacific). Compared to a year ago, these developments mean APAC now has some SAF flowing into aircraft engines rather than SAF being purely theoretical.

Since 2024, there has been a notable rise in funding commitments and joint ventures to kickstart APAC's SAF industry. Government incentives have emerged where none existed before. Notably, in September 2025 Australia announced a A$1.1 billion (US$735 million) 'Cleaner Fuels' programme, a ten-year fund to support domestic production of biofuels and e-fuels with the aim of having projects producing fuel by 2029. This marks the first major APAC government subsidy programme for SAF. Private-sector investment alliances have grown. Qantas and Airbus's Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance (SAFFA) had around US$200 million committed by mid-2024 to invest in SAF production projects globally. Through such alliances, APAC airlines are co-financing new SAF technologies and securing future supply. Airlines are also signing long-term offtake agreements: Japan Airlines, for instance, agreed to a 10-year SAF supply MOU with US-based Raven SR, starting with 50,000 tonnes in 2025 and scaling to 200,000 tonnes per year within a decade. The past 12 months saw APAC governments and companies putting real money on the table, a clear sign that the business case for SAF is being taken seriously in the region.

The global SAF landscape has also shifted in ways that affect APAC. Europe's SAF blending mandate kicked in on 1 January 2025 (starting at 2%), and the United States' tax credit incentives under the 2022 IRA are now spurring dozens of new SAF projects. Over the past year, SAF produced in Asia has tended to flow to Europe where mandates create a price premium, raising concerns that APAC might face local shortages or higher costs if it lags behind in policy. IATA reports that most SAF supply in 2025 is headed to Europe, and warns that Europe's approach has driven SAF prices to five times that of conventional jet fuel. This external pressure is a key reason APAC policymakers have hastened their own SAF agendas since 2024. APAC's response through mandates, partnerships, and capacity-building will determine whether it remains a net importer of SAF credits to meet climate goals, or becomes a competitive producer.

APAC's SAF landscape in 2025 is defined by emerging policy frameworks, initial production capacity, and mobilised financing, a notable evolution from 2024's landscape of voluntary airline pledges and theoretical potential. We now see the first concrete mandates on the horizon (most starting latest by 2027), significant capital being directed into SAF ventures, and early adoption mechanisms like book-and-claim gaining traction. Still, the region faces familiar hurdles: high SAF costs, limited near-term supply, feedstock logistics, and the need for broader infrastructure. This report will examine these developments in detail, outline the key challenges and opportunities as the region navigates the pivotal 2025-2027 period on its journey toward cleaner aviation fuel.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/68ff5b2a03a33c3c44a429da/1761641576150/2.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-10-28 11:57:55.795794

Travelers around the world are becoming more conscious of their environmental impact, and the aviation industry is responding with bold moves. Europe and the UK are leading the global charge in the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a key solution in the fight against climate change. With robust policies like ReFuelEU and the SAF Mandate, Europe is positioning itself as a hub for cleaner, greener skies. This transition isn’t just good for the planet; it’s also an exciting development for travelers seeking eco-friendly travel options.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a revolutionary fuel source that aims to reduce the aviation sector’s carbon footprint. Unlike traditional jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable feedstocks such as waste oils, plants, and even algae. SAF can significantly lower carbon emissions when used in place of conventional aviation fuel, making it a crucial component in global decarbonization efforts.

In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation is a landmark regulation that mandates a growing percentage of aviation fuel supplied at EU airports to be SAF. Starting at just 2% in 2025, this requirement will rise to 70% by 2050. This commitment aligns with the EU’s ambitious climate goals and ensures that travelers can enjoy a cleaner flight experience as SAF becomes more widely adopted.

Europe and the UK’s Role in the SAF Revolution

Both the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) have embraced the need for cleaner aviation fuel, creating frameworks and incentives that encourage SAF production. The EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) sets a target of 42.5% renewable energy across the bloc by 2030. With a focus on sustainable transportation fuels, including SAF, the EU is positioning itself as a global leader in the transition to cleaner energy.

In the UK, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) requires at least 14.6% of fuels used in road transport to be renewable by 2025. This has spurred demand for advanced biofuels, including SAF, made from waste products. Additionally, the UK’s SAF Mandate calls for 2% SAF to be blended into aviation fuel by 2025, gradually increasing to 22% by 2040. This policy reflects the UK’s commitment to reducing aviation-related carbon emissions and improving fuel sustainability.

Tourists and Travelers: What Does SAF Mean for You?

For global travelers, the shift towards SAF offers an exciting prospect: flying with a lighter environmental footprint. Airlines operating out of European airports are increasingly incorporating SAF into their fuel mix. As SAF production scales up, travelers can expect to board planes powered by cleaner fuels, helping to reduce the aviation sector’s contribution to global warming.

Tourists visiting Europe will see firsthand how the continent is embracing sustainable energy, not just in aviation but across all sectors. Many European airlines are expected to meet SAF mandates in the coming years, making flights more eco-friendly for everyone.

Aviation Decarbonization and Its Global Impact

The push for SAF is part of a broader strategy to decarbonize aviation—a sector that has long been difficult to electrify. In fact, aviation contributes significantly to global carbon emissions. The adoption of SAF will be a game-changer, offering a renewable alternative to fossil-based jet fuel. This will help achieve global climate goals, including those set by the Paris Agreement.

As SAF production grows, it will play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions from air travel, which is one of the most carbon-intensive forms of transport. However, the production of SAF is still in its early stages, and Europe is expected to lead the way in scaling up its availability. In fact, eSAF (electro-fuel SAF), which is made using renewable electricity and captured carbon, is expected to become a cornerstone of Europe’s aviation decarbonization efforts.

The Challenges: Supply, Costs, and Investment

While the transition to SAF is promising, there are challenges ahead. One of the primary concerns is the availability of feedstocks. As countries like China increase their domestic use of waste oils, the supply of renewable materials for SAF production could become constrained. Additionally, scaling up SAF production requires significant investment in infrastructure and technology.

Despite these challenges, Europe remains committed to overcoming these barriers, and governments are working alongside private industry to create a more sustainable aviation sector. Investment in technologies like Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and synthetic fuels is expected to accelerate, paving the way for a future where SAF is the norm, not the exception.

Looking Ahead: SAF’s Role in Global Travel

As the world becomes more eco-conscious, travelers can expect to see more sustainable options on their flight bookings. The EU and UK are proving that a transition to renewable aviation fuels is not just possible, but necessary. For tourists visiting Europe, it’s an opportunity to experience first-hand how forward-thinking policies can shape a cleaner, greener future.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Aircrft-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 04:56:08.529719

The company says it will operate as a fully scheduled carrier rather than a charter service, but with the space, service, and privacy typically associated with private jets and semi-private air travel.

At its launch, Magnifica plans to have a fleet of six Airbus aircraft, including four A220-300s and two A321neos. However, the planes will have far fewer seats than standard versions—roughly 45 to 54 instead of more than 120. The leather lie-flat seats will be arranged in two-by-two rows, and planes will have two to four enclosed “private suites,” complete with banquette seating and sliding doors, as well as a bar area at the tail end of the plane. The planes will have a sleek, minimalist look; the whole design concept evokes the aesthetic of luxury around-the-world charters, like those operated by Four Seasons and Aman.

The airline plans to offer a door-to-door experience that begins with chauffeured transfers and private-terminal check-ins and ends with expedited baggage handling upon arrival. Travelers will reportedly be able to check in 30 minutes before departure—an experience designed to seem frictionless compared to commercial air travel and the long security lines and crowded airport boarding gates that come with it. The company has also stated that sustainability is a core part of its brand. Magnifica has pledged to use a 50 percent blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from the start (with 100 percent SAF usage by 2030) and operate newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft to reduce emissions.

Initial routes are expected to link major U.S. business and leisure markets, including New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, and Houston, along with seasonal flights to Napa and the Caribbean. The company says it will operate as a fully scheduled airline rather than a charter service, targeting travelers who want the consistency and reliability of commercial aviation but the intimacy and speed of private flying. “We’re offering a fully private, seamless experience for a fraction of what you’d pay to charter a jet,” Magnifica wrote in a blog post. Ticket pricing, however, has not yet been announced.

In recent years, the market for more premium travel has grown exponentially, as travelers look for greater comfort, more personal space, and less time spent in crowded terminals.

Carriers like Delta, United, and American have all invested heavily in upgraded premium products (both in-flight and within their airport lounges), while private aviation companies have seen record membership numbers.

New Green Fee Takes Off in 2026

Singapore introduced a fixed levy on all departing flights to support cleaner aviation practices starting in 2026. The levy will fund the purchase and management of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for airlines refueling in Singapore.

Authorities aim for SAF to make up 1% of all jet fuel by 2026 and 3–5% by 2030. This initiative strengthens Singapore’s leadership in sustainable aviation and long-term emissions reduction.

Funding Sustainable Air Travel

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will collect the levy from all departing flights. Funds will be used to manage bulk SAF procurement and ensure stable supply for airlines.

The levy will remain fixed to protect airlines and passengers from price fluctuations in the SAF market. Authorities believe this approach will drive demand for SAF and support global sustainability goals.

Impact on Airfares

Officials expect only a small fare increase shared by all travellers and operators.

A short-haul economy flight to Bangkok may rise by S$3 (US$2.30).

A long-haul flight to London could increase by S$16 (US$11.80).

Authorities emphasise that the contribution is minor compared to the environmental benefits achieved.

Industry Debate Over Green Costs

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned the levy could discourage air travel. IATA prefers government incentives or subsidies instead of direct passenger levies.

Singapore’s former Temasek CEO, Ho Ching, called IATA’s criticism “wrong headed” and short-sighted. She argued that shared financial responsibility is essential for aviation’s sustainable future.

A Step Toward Cleaner Skies

The levy reinforces Singapore’s position as a sustainability leader in Asian aviation. It balances environmental responsibility with long-term economic growth in the travel sector.

The report celebrates the important first steps taken by the EU, particularly with the 2025 mandatory target for 2% of the total aviation fuel supplied at designated Union airports to be SAF.

“A functioning system is now in place, initial reporting compliance levels are solid, and SAF delivery is happening across multiple member states,” said Maria Rueda, EASA’s Safety Management, Sustainability and Global Outreach Director.

EASA also underlined that from 2025, the data supplied for the report will be used to assess whether the obligation to supply at least 2% of total aviation fuel as SAF has been met.

Key findings in the report show that production capacity assessments indicate the EU is on track to meet the overall mandatory SAF blending target (6%) in 2030.

It also found that the average price of SAF in 2024 was €2,085/ tonne (versus €734/tonne for conventional jet fuel).

While 25 fuel suppliers provided SAF to 33 EU airports across 12 member states, airports in five member states, including the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Germany.)

Senior Researcher Young-hoon Kim, POSCO Research Institute

Rapidly Expanding SAF Market

In the past, the automotive industry rose to the challenge of reducing its carbon footprint, resulting in the widespread presence of eco-friendly vehicles on today’s roads. Today, the aviation industry accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon emissions and, much like the automotive sector in the past, is now grappling with the challenge of reducing them. It is no exaggeration to say that the aviation sector’s sustainability increasingly hinges on SAF. SAF is a fuel developed to replace conventional jet fuel, produced from raw materials such as used cooking oil; vegetable and animal oils/fats; biomass; animal manure; waste wood; municipal solid waste; and captured carbon dioxide (CO2). It delivers performance equivalent to conventional jet fuel while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions from the production process by up to about 80%.

The first use of SAF in the aviation industry took place in 2008, but usage was negligible at the time. A major shift began in 2021, when the International Air Transport Association (IATA) adopted a resolution at its 77th Annual General Meeting to achieve net-zero carbon by 2050. Following this decision, the share of SAF in global jet fuel consumption rose steadily: 0.1% in 2022, 0.2% in 2023, and 0.3% in 2024, increasing by approximately 0.1 percentage points each year.

The global SAF market is growing rapidly as countries around the world gradually increase mandatory SAF blending requirements. By 2030, the United States, Japan, and Singapore plan to require SAF to account for 10% of total jet fuel use. The European Union (EU) has set a target of 6%, and Indonesia aims for 2.5%. Korea is also aligning with these global efforts. In August 2024, the government announced a policy that will make a 1% SAF blend mandatory for all international departing flights starting in 2027. As a result of these policy shifts, the global SAF market is expected to grow to around USD 67 billion (approximately KRW 92.4 trillion) by 2030 — roughly 30 times its current size.

If the SAF market is formed, various raw materials including biomass will be required, and there is a high possibility that the global raw material supply chain will be reorganized. Therefore, countries that possess raw materials or have strengths in raw material development are paying close attention to SAF as a new growth industry. In the past, the aviation fuel market was a monopoly and oligopoly market based on crude oil as a single raw material. However, because SAF uses various raw materials such as oils and fats, herbaceous and lignocellulosic biomass*, and industrial off-gases (CO, CO2, H2), the market has shifted to an intensely competitive one.

*Herbaceous and lignocellulosic biomass refers to trees and herbaceous plants containing cellulose, as well as products and waste derived from them. It is mainly used as a raw material for the production of biofuels, bioplastics, and biochemical substances.

U.S. Eyes SAF as a New Growth Industry

The United States is emerging as an optimal location for SAF production, leveraging its competitive advantage in producing bioethanol, a next-generation SAF raw material, from agricultural crops such as soybeans, corn, and sugarcane, as well as from agricultural byproducts. The Trump administration has also expressed interest in fostering the domestic SAF industry, pledging to maintain support under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

In May 2025, the administration announced a restructuring plan to dramatically reduce or terminate clean energy tax credits. However, it maintained the Section 45Z Clean Transportation Fuel Credit for SAF, which provides up to USD 1.75 per gallon (approximately KRW 2,419) in incentives, and extended its expiration date by five years, from 2027 to 2032. In particular, while continuing to support fuels that achieve at least a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions, the U.S. framework, unlike global standardization efforts, excludes Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC)* CO2 emissions from its calculation boundary. This approach has enabled corn-based bioethanol to be included as an eligible fuel for federal support.

*Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) refers to land-use changes that occur when farmland or pasture previously used for food or feed crops is converted to biofuel crop production, and to meet the displaced demand, forests or grasslands that had been used for other purposes are cleared and converted into cropland.

In other words, when corn in the United States is used for bioethanol, the supply of corn for food decreases, leading other countries to convert forests into cropland to meet that demand. Because corn has high ILUC emissions, it is a crop with a low CO2 reduction rate. However, in the United States, because ILUC emissions are excluded from the CO2 calculation boundary, corn’s CO2 reduction rate rises to more than 50% compared with conventional jet fuel, and it has therefore been included as an eligible fuel for support programs.

Japan Takes an Active Role in Building the SAF Market

How is Japan responding? At the U.S.–Japan summit in February 2025, Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that securing a stable supply of resources such as bioethanol, in addition to LNG, from the United States would bring great national benefit to Japan. President Trump also noted his close relationship with the farming community and expressed strong interest in building a bilateral supply chain based on bioethanol.

Japan, leveraging the resource development capabilities of its general trading companies, is establishing a supply network for SAF raw materials such as used cooking oil, vegetable oils, and bioethanol. To encourage investment in domestic SAF production, the government provides subsidies covering between one-third and one-half of capital costs. To meet its mandate requiring 10% SAF use by 2030, Japan will need about 1.3 million tons of SAF per year. Four major refiners are currently reviewing six SAF production projects, and the government plans to cover between one-third and one-half of the investment depending on the technology. Japanese trading companies are participating as reliable raw material suppliers for SAF production in Japan through two of these projects, importing bioethanol from the United States and Brazil. As Japan’s domestic SAF production increases, they are expected to expand their role from supplying the domestic market to exporting SAF.

China and India are Transitioning from Raw Material Exporters to SAF Producers

China is shifting toward producing and exporting SAF domestically as the United States has strengthened import tariffs on Chinese used cooking oil, making it more difficult to export raw materials, and as demand for SAF has expanded mainly in the European Union (EU). One of China’s SAF producers, Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech, has received government approval to export up to 370,000 tons of SAF and has already exported 13,400 tons this year.

India also has abundant SAF raw materials, including used cooking oil and crop residues, and it is expected that the country will be able to produce up to 24 million tons of SAF by 2030. As the domestic aviation market continues to grow rapidly, up to 10 million tons are expected to be consumed domestically, and the remainder will be directed toward exports.

POSCO Group Secures Diverse Core Raw Materials for SAF Production

Korean companies are also actively pursuing the SAF market. POSCO possesses a range of raw materials that can serve as a foundation for expanding into the SAF business, making it possible to enter the market through collaboration with refiners.

POSCO International began developing plantations on Papua Island, Indonesia, in 2011 and started commercial palm oil production in 2016. In the palm oil refining process, various byproducts such as palm oil mill effluent and empty fruit bunches are generated, and since they are recognized as SAF raw materials, refiners’ interest is high. Sugarcane and corn, which are drawing attention as next-generation SAF raw materials, and bioethanol made by saccharifying them, can also be secured through POSCO International’s trading capabilities.

POSCO International has already laid the groundwork for growth in the eco-friendly business market, including SAF, by obtaining two international certifications in October 2024. The certifications obtained are ISCC EU*, a global certification that ensures the sustainability of biofuel production in accordance with the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive, and ISCC CORSIA**, a certification that guarantees the sustainability of aviation fuels. Through the acquisition of these international certifications, POSCO International has secured both the qualification to export biofuels and raw materials to the European market and the eligibility to supply raw materials for SAF production. This achievement is anticipated to provide substantial opportunities for growth in the EU and the international aviation industry.

*ISCC EU (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification EU) is an international certification program that verifies the sustainability of biofuels in accordance with the European Union (EU) Renewable Energy Directive.

**ISCC CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) is a program that certifies Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) that meets the standards of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Various by-product gases are generated at POSCO’s steel mills. Among these, carbon monoxide (CO) and CO2 are regarded as next-generation SAF raw materials due to the absence of supply limitations. This technology involves producing SAF by converting CO into bioethanol and refining it into aviation fuel, or by reforming* CO2 into CO and synthesizing it with clean hydrogen. The Future Technology Research Laboratories of POSCO Holdings, in collaboration with LG Chem, plans to initiate a large-scale carbon capture and utilization (CCU) mega project in 2026, aimed at capturing CO2 and converting it into SAF raw materials. Upon successful completion of the demonstration project, POSCO is expected to enter the next-generation SAF market.

*Reforming is a technology that uses a metal catalyst to react CO2 and hydrocarbons such as methane to produce synthesis gas (a mixture of hydrogen and CO).

Preemptive Entry into the SAF Market to Seize Opportunities

So, is the transition of the aviation fuel market to SAF an opportunity or a threat for Korean companies? As Korea is the world’s leading exporter of aviation fuel, the global shift to SAF is seen more as a threat than an opportunity for Korean companies. For domestic aviation and refining industries, slowing down the speed of the transition to the SAF market may be advantageous in the short term.

However, since SAF is a strategic item that can change the structure of the multi-trillion-won aviation fuel market, it is important to note that major countries are recognizing it as a new industry and are actively participating in market creation. In particular, considering that the United States, Australia, Japan, Singapore, and the Netherlands, which are actively participating in SAF market creation, are Korea’s major aviation fuel export destinations, the market should be reviewed from a comprehensive perspective of defending the existing aviation fuel market and creating new SAF industries.

POSCO Group needs to review ways to participate in the SAF market in advance by utilizing POSCO International’s resource development capabilities and POSCO’s CCU technology using carbon dioxide. It is especially important to review various business models, including preemptively participating in overseas markets, which are expanding relatively quickly, beyond the domestic model, where the pace is expected to be slower.",https://newsroom.posco.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251027_en_img_thumb.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 00:56:22.030794

This is because they are passing on the cost of compliance with EU and UK SAF mandates to their airline customers.

This adds even further to the cost of SAF, already much more expensive than jet fuel.

Moreover, through the law of unintended consequences, it acts as a disincentive to the development of the embryonic SAF market that the mandates are aimed at stimulating.

Mr Walsh argues that European regulators should eliminate SAF mandates.

He may have a point.

Summary

IATA’s Willie Walsh says SAF suppliers are extracting “additional profit from airlines” and “price gouging”.

The EU and UK place SAF mandates on fuel suppliers, who pass compliance costs on to airlines, slowing the development of an efficient SAF market.

The production of SAF, crucial to aviation’s 2050 net zero, is low but rising.

Biomass feedstocks for SAF are available, but will also be needed for other applications.

eSAF, or PtL (power-to-liquid technology, will be very important. PtL projects are mainly in the development phase, but numbers are growing.

IATA's Walsh: fuel suppliers are extracting ""additional profit from airlines"" and ""price gouging""

In an interview with Reuters (13-Oct-2025) IATA director general Willie Walsh argued that fuel suppliers were inflating the cost of SAF at EU and UK airports by charging airlines a compliance surcharge.

He argued that suppliers were extracting ""additional profit from airlines"".

Moreover, he reasoned, the SAF mandates ""...have, in effect, facilitated price gouging by fuel suppliers in the name of the environment, and that's completely unacceptable"".

Why did he make this claim?

The EU and UK place SAF mandates on fuel suppliers…

The EU and the UK require fuel suppliers to include a mandated percentage of SAF in their jet fuel mix, rising over time.

Both require 2% in 2025, with the UK mandate rising to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040. Under the EU mandate, called 'ReFuelEU Aviation', the requirement rises to 6% in 2030, 34% in 2040, and 70% in 2050.

…who pass on the cost of compliance to airlines…

The mandate falls on fuel suppliers, rather than airlines, as does the cost of compliance with it.

However, according to IATA, most fuel suppliers pass on the cost of complying with the regulation through a compliance fee charged to airlines.

The market price of SAF varies significantly, but in 2024 it averaged USD2,350 per tonne, which is 3.1 times the price of jet fuel derived from fossil fuels (source: IATA).

With the addition of compliance fees in Europe, the effective price of SAF is nearly double its market price, according to IATA.

…working against the development of an efficient SAF market

In analysis published in May-2025, IATA observed that fuel suppliers' pricing behaviour ""works against the development of a global, liquid, and transparent SAF market, as suppliers avoid contracting for the supply of mandated SAF with airlines"".

The airline trade body estimated that airlines in the EU would face an additional cost of USD1.3 billion in 2025 as a result of excess compliance fees. IATA added that this sum could purchase an additional 1.2 million tonnes of SAF and cut an additional 2.7 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.

It estimated that the UK mandate would lead to a missed opportunity to cut an additional 0.8 million tonnes of CO2.

IATA's May-2025 analysis concluded: ""Paying more to abate less is unacceptable"".

In his recent interview with Reuters, Mr Walsh's language was more forthcoming.

The production of SAF, crucial to aviation's 2050 net zero, is low but rising

SAF is crucial to achieving aviation's goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Production remains at low levels, at just 0.3% of jet fuel consumption in 2024 - but it is increasing.

In absolute terms, 2024 SAF production of 1Mt was twice the volume of 2023. IATA expects it to double again in 2025 to 2Mt, or 0.7% of world jet fuel use of 311Mt.

Moreover, the number of airlines entering into off-take agreements with SAF suppliers is growing.

According to IATA, from a standing start in 2013, 81 airlines had announced 170 deals by Jun-2025.

Almost 40% of those airlines had more than one agreement.

Biomass feedstocks for SAF are available, but will also be needed for other applications

There are a number of feedstocks (sources) of SAF under the broad heading of biomass, which refers to matter from recently living organisms.

Biomass feedstocks include agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, forestry residues and wood waste and crop-based feedstocks and waste oils.

A Sep-2025 study by IATA and Worley Consulting found that, while biomass availability is substantial, only a small proportion of it is likely to find its way into SAF production.

According to the study, unconstrained feedstock availability will exceed 12,000Mt by 2050 - but only 4,200Mt will be available for bioenergy and biofuels after allocations to other sectors.

Furthermore, after applying a large amount of this to power, heat and biochemicals, only 1,580Mt will be available for SAF production in 2050 (but this is estimated to be a 30% increase from 2030).

Potential availability of global biomass feedstocks for SAF production by 2050

Source: IATA Sustainability and Economics, Worley Consulting.

This feedstock volume converts into 300Mt of SAF in 2050, while 500Mt will be needed to meet the net zero target.

The gap can be closed, in part, if conversion efficiencies improve further - through technology, improved feedstock logistics and better infrastructure.

eSAF, or PtL (power-to-liquid technology) will be very important in reaching targets

A key factor in closing the gap will also be the use of eSAF, which is derived from power-to-liquid (PtL) technology.

PtL fuels are synthetic liquid hydrocarbon fuels produced from renewable electricity, water and carbon dioxide (CO2).

The hydrogen is produced by the electrolysis of water using renewable electricity ('green hydrogen'), and the CO2 needs to be captured from the atmosphere or come from sources that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere.

Synthetic fuels are regarded as more scalable, deriving from renewable electricity as their source of energy. They are less dependent on feedstocks than SAF derived from biomass, and lead to greater emissions reductions.

PtL projects are mainly in the development phase, but numbers are growing

PtL projects are mainly still in the development phase.

At the time of IATA's AGM in Jun-2025, 90% of the 60 PtL projects scheduled by 2030 were still at the announcement stage, and only one commercial scale project was under construction (in the US).

Both the EU and UK SAF mandates include targets for PtL, and these have helped to stimulate the growth of PtL projects.

Policies to incentivise SAF, rather than mandate it, could be more effective

Mr Walsh's call on EU and UK regulators to abandon their SAF mandates is not a call to abandon the net zero target.

Rather, it is a plea to remove market distortions that make this already very expensive fuel even more expensive, adding to the cost burden of airlines and dissuading them from purchasing more.

Policy aimed at facilitating and incentivising the supply of SAF, rather than mandating it, could be more effective.

For example, US policy in this area includes SAF production targets, but these are not mandatory. Rather, it features credits and funding opportunities to encourage and reward SAF production.

A supportive policy framework and financial incentives to encourage investors and producers at sufficient scale is vital in Europe.

Producers need support to overcome the technological challenges of SAF production and greater pricing certainty into the future through revenue guarantees.",https://static.routesonline.com/images/cached/newsarticle-299665324-cropped-200x200.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 21:16:30.452264

Sustainable aviation fuels are blended with conventional jet fuel. Right now, most of the ways to make the fuel need more study. Only one type — traditionally using things like fatty acids — are used commercially. Hundreds of thousands of flights have used this type of fuel, according to the State Department of Ecology.

In the last legislative session in Olympia, lawmakers directed the department to study potential — or likely — environmental impacts of making and distributing sustainable aviation fuels. And ways to avoid those issues.

The department is in the very beginning stages of its review. But leaders would like help figuring out the scope of the study. The study won’t approve or deny any specific projects. It is eventually meant to be a resource for possible future biofuels projects in Washington.

The state’s goal is to lower greenhouse gas emissions from flying. However, at a recent public comment session, Longview resident Diane Dick called many proposals for this type of jet fuel in her area “boondoggles.”

“It will never be sustainable. The only way to reduce jet fuel emissions is for people to understand they need to fly less,” Dick said.

The venture, established to construct and operate a Renewable Fuels Facility at Par Pacific's existing Kapolei, Hawaii refinery, solidifies a major partnership with international energy leaders.

The successful closing brings Mitsubishi Corporation and ENEOS Corporation into the venture through their joint entity, Alohi Renewable Energy LLC. In a substantial endorsement of the project's potential, Alohi Renewable Energy has acquired a 36.5% equity stake in Hawaii Renewables in exchange for a $100 million cash consideration. Par Pacific retains the remaining majority interest and will manage the completion and ongoing operations of the new facility via its affiliate, Par Hawaii Refining, LLC.

The facility represents a critical investment in the state's decarbonization efforts and is on track to be completed by the end of the year. Once operational, it will stand as Hawaii’s largest renewable fuels manufacturing facility. The plant is engineered for high-volume production, with an expected annual output of approximately 61 million gallons of low-carbon fuels. This portfolio will include renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable naphtha, and low carbon liquified petroleum gases (LPGs). The facility is specifically designed with the flexibility to produce up to 60% SAF, directly addressing the significant air travel market in Hawaii.

The joint venture leverages Par Pacific’s existing world-class refining infrastructure and extensive logistics network across the Pacific. The partnership with Mitsubishi and ENEOS, leading global energy and trading companies from Japan, provides complementary strengths, including enhanced feedstock procurement expertise and expanded market access throughout the Pacific Basin. This collaboration is set to bolster the security and stability of Hawaii's energy supply while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Par Pacific's President & CEO, Will Monteleone, emphasized the strategic importance of the collaboration, noting that the joint venture ""brings together the best of our three organizations and yields additional scale and expertise across feedstock origination, commercial optimization, and market access."" The $100 million investment not only provides capital but also integrates deep expertise from two major global energy players, positioning the Kapolei facility as a cornerstone of sustainable fuel production in the region.

The new laws, SB 253 and SB 261, were approved by Governor Newsom in 2023, and signed into law in October 2024.
The new laws will introduce climate-related reporting requirements for most large companies in the U.S., even as other climate disclosure regulations, such as the SEC’s climate reporting rule, appear increasingly less likely to be implemented.

The suit asks the court to declare that each of the new laws violate the First Amendment, and that SB 261 is preempted by the NSMIA, and to enjoin California from enforcing the laws.","Energy giant ExxonMobil filed a lawsuit in a U.S. federal court challenging new California laws requiring large companies to disclose their value chain greenhouse gas emissions and report on climate-related risks.

According to the suit, ExxonMobil is asking the court to declare that California’s new climate-related reporting laws violate First Amendment free speech rights – claiming that their main goal is to “embarrass” large companies and compel speech in support of the state’s ideological goals – and to prevent the state from enforcing them.

Notably, the new laws have already survived a series of First Amendment-based court challenges brought by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, including a recent decision by the court denying a motion to block enforcement of the laws on free speech grounds, although that case is still proceeding to trial, currently scheduled for October 2026.

The new laws, SB 253 and SB 261, were approved by Governor Newsom in 2023, and signed into law in October 2024. SB 253 requires companies with revenues greater than $1 billion that do business in California to report annually on their direct Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and Scope 3 value chain emissions, including those associated with supply chains, business travel, employee commuting, procurement, waste, and water usage. SB 261 applies to U.S. companies that do business in California and with revenues greater than $500 million to prepare a report disclosing their climate-related financial risk, as well as measures to reduce and adapt to that risk.

Disclosures of Scope 1 and 2 emissions under the new law is scheduled to begin in 2026, covering the previous fiscal year, while Scope 3 emissions reporting will begin in 2027, while the first climate-related risk reports are to be published by January 1, 2026.

The new laws will introduce climate-related reporting requirements for most large companies in the U.S., even as other climate disclosure regulations, such as the SEC’s climate reporting rule, appear increasingly less likely to be implemented. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) recently issued a preliminary list of more than 4,000 U.S. companies likely to be required to comply with the new climate reporting laws.

In its lawsuit, ExxonMobil said that it already discloses its greenhouse gas emissions and its climate-related business risks, but the company argued that the reporting frameworks required to be used by companies under the new laws will force the company to “speak in service” of California’s “ideological premise,” that “that large companies are uniquely responsible for climate change no matter how efficiently they satisfy societal demand for energy, goods, and services.”

The suit notes, for example, that SB 253 requires disclosure of Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions based on the GHG Protocol standards and guidance, which the company argues focuses on absolute emissions rather than emissions intensity, which effectively makes large companies look worse than small companies. ExxonMobil also argues that the GHG Protocol framework fails to account for avoided emissions achieved by making a product more carbon efficient, and that by requiring reporting on all emissions scopes, overcounts emissions, with the lawsuit noting that “an energy producer’s Scope 2 emissions would be the same as its power company’s Scope 1 emissions, and its Scope 3 emissions would be the same as its customers’ Scope 1 emissions.”

SB 261 requires reporting on climate-related financial risk in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) or an equivalent framework, which the suit argues goes beyond the SEC’s requirements to detail all material financial risks, and will require companies to “create and publicly disclose a detailed, speculative risk report.” The suit argues that the law “deprives ExxonMobil of the option not to speak on any of the speculative topics” from the framework, and requires the company to explain why it chooses not to publish climate targets.

Additionally, the lawsuit argues that the National Securities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA) preempts SB 261 from requiring disclosure of more detailed information on risks than those already covered by SEC requirements.

The suit asks the court to declare that each of the new laws violate the First Amendment, and that SB 261 is preempted by the NSMIA, and to enjoin California from enforcing the laws.",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Exxon2.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 15:00:27.014262

Resolving the trade dispute with China was a key request in the letter from congressional delegates Monday.
Iowa Soybean Association President Tom Adam said in a statement related to the letter that agriculture “prospers” when America can lead in global trade.
Finally, lawmakers in the letter wrote that farmers need communication and a strategy from the administration in order to plan for the future.
“We’ve appreciated the openness of the Administration to meet with stakeholders and hear their concerns,” the letter reads.","Iowa lawmakers U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, along with U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wisconsin, urged a “coordinated action” across the Trump administration to prioritize soybeans in a trade deal with China and to finalize renewable fuel guidelines.

The GOP lawmakers addressed a letter Monday on behalf of soybean producers and related industries who have been “priced out of the market” due to the impacts of the ongoing trade disputes with China.

China, a major soybean importer, has not placed an order with U.S. producers this year. Instead, the country has turned to Argentina for several shiploads of soybeans in a move similar to the country’s actions during the trade wars of the first Trump administration when China looked to Brazil for its soybeans.

President Donald Trump is set to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Thursday, though news reports from the weekend indicated the leaders have established a framework for a trade deal that includes purchases of agricultural materials.

Resolving the trade dispute with China was a key request in the letter from congressional delegates Monday.

“The United States should make soybean market access a central priority in trade discussions with China and work toward the suspension or removal of retaliatory duties that are distorting global competition,” the letter said.

Iowa Soybean Association President Tom Adam said in a statement related to the letter that agriculture “prospers” when America can lead in global trade.

“The longer trade tensions persist, the greater the damage of permanently weakening relationships with key markets—turning the U.S. into a secondary rather than preferred supplier of soybeans,” Adam said.

Nunn said producers are “flying blind” and asking what the administration’s plan is to fix the situation.

“Right now, bins are full, prices are underwater, and the ongoing government shutdown is adding even more uncertainty to an already tough situation,” Nunn said. “Iowa farmers deserve to compete on fair terms, and I look forward to hearing back from the administration.”

USDA announces plan to ‘strengthen’ beef industry

Calls for renewable fuels guidance

In addition to a trade deal with China, the letter asks for finalization on 45z tax credit guidelines and renewable volume obligations, or RVOs, that industry leaders say will grow the renewable fuel industry and domestic demand for soybeans.

“Agencies should work together to identify and expand alternative markets for soybeans and soybean meal, remove unnecessary barriers to trade, and deploy the full suite of tools to help U.S. farmers remain competitive,” the letter said.

The 45z tax credit, which was initiated during the Biden administration and extended under the Republican-led “one big beautiful” law, encourages the production of low-emission biofuels, like sustainable aviation fuel.

While the U.S. Department of the Treasury has released initial guidelines on the tax credit, the renewable fuel industry continues to call for finalized guidelines to produce fuels within the eligible emission ranges.

Devin Mogler, the National Oilseed Processors Association president and CEO, said the soybean processing industry has invested more than $6 billion to expand capacity by more than 25% by selling into the biofuels industry.

“But we need certainty on biofuels policy to ensure the industry can run at capacity, particularly coming off a record harvest,” Mogler said in a statement. “We greatly appreciate Congressman Nunn’s leadership in working with the administration to finalize strong RVOs and 45Z so these policies translate into value at the farmgate.”

Renewable volume obligations are part of the renewable fuel standards issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that establish standards for the quantities of biofuels to be blended into U.S. transportation fuels.

In June, the agency proposed historic standards for the industry, including a substantial jump in the amounts of biomass-based diesel standards, of which soybeans are a feedstock.

The letter calls for these proposed rates to be finalized.

Finally, lawmakers in the letter wrote that farmers need communication and a strategy from the administration in order to plan for the future.

“We’ve appreciated the openness of the Administration to meet with stakeholders and hear their concerns,” the letter reads. “However, we’ve reached a point where our producers need clear signals, not continued uncertainty, to make informed marketing and planting decisions.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Iowa-cultivator-1181123755.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 15:00:35.404967

This is not a single-technology story; it includes biofuels, biogases, and low-emissions hydrogen — and it would reshape transport, shipping, aviation, and parts of industry over the next decade.

The Headline Numbers: What “Quadruple” Means in Practice

The IEA’s Delivering Sustainable Fuels analysis finds that global consumption of liquid and gaseous sustainable fuels could quadruple by 2035 compared with 2024 if policies already proposed or enacted are fully implemented. Under that pathway, sustainable fuels would supply roughly 10% of global road transport demand, 15% of aviation demand, and 35% of shipping fuel demand by 2035 — dramatic increases from today’s shares.

Those rises are driven by several components: scaling biofuels and biogases, rapid growth in low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-derived fuels, and policy mandates (e.g., blending requirements and procurement rules) that push markets toward cleaner liquid and gaseous fuels.

Which Fuels and Sectors Will Grow Fastest?

Transport is the principal near-term driver of demand for sustainable fuels to 2035, with heavy industry and power-sector uses expanding after 2030 as low-emissions hydrogen becomes more available.

Aviation (SAF): Sustainable aviation fuel production is expanding quickly — IATA expected SAF production to double in 2025 to about 2 million tonnes, though that still represents a tiny fraction of total jet-fuel demand.

Shipping: The IEA projects sustainable fuels could cover an estimated 35% of shipping fuel demand by 2035 under the fully-implemented policy scenario.

Road transport: Sustainable fuels could supply around 10% of road transport demand by 2035 in the IEA pathway.

The IEA stresses that scaling requires investment, supply-chain diversification, and strong sustainability safeguards to avoid unintended consequences (land use change, biodiversity loss).

Investment, Industry Moves, and Policy Signals

Meeting a fourfold rise will demand large capital flows and industry commitments. IEA and related analyses point to increased investment in low-emissions fuels as part of a broader surge in clean energy spending: energy-sector capital flows are projected to be over USD 3.3 trillion in 2025, with substantial shares directed to clean technologies, including low-emissions fuels.

Oil majors are already placing big bets on biofuels and SAF: a 2024/25 industry survey reported 40+ major projects by 2030 and potential capacity additions equivalent to hundreds of thousands of barrels per day of biofuel feedstock processing. Meanwhile, several countries (Brazil, India, Italy, Japan, and others) have publicly pledged or signalled ambition to scale sustainable fuels in line with IEA recommendations.

Policy examples also matter: Indonesia is considering SAF blending requirements (starting at 1% in 2026 and rising to 5% by 2035) to spur domestic production, illustrating how national mandates can seed local industries.

Risks, Sustainability, Constraints, and Trade-Offs

A rapid push to quadruple sustainable fuel use is technically feasible but not risk-free. The main caveats the IEA highlights include supply-chain bottlenecks, feedstock competition with food and ecosystems, permitting and financing delays, and the current higher cost of many sustainable fuels relative to fossil equivalents.

Environmental safeguards are crucial: large-scale biofuel rollouts without protections can drive deforestation and biodiversity loss. Critics warn that ambitious pledges (e.g., rapid biofuel expansion) must include strict land-use, biodiversity, and social safeguards to avoid repeating past mistakes.

What the IEA Says Needs to Happen Now

The IEA frames the pathway toward quadrupling as policy-dependent. Key near-term actions include: stronger mandates and procurement targets for SAF and renewable fuels, incentives for low-emissions hydrogen production and electrolyser deployment, clearer sustainability criteria and certification systems, and public-private finance mechanisms to de-risk early projects.

The agency also underlines international cooperation; for technology transfer, harmonised standards and cross-border trade in sustainable fuels, and robust monitoring to ensure greenhouse-gas benefits are real across life cycles.

Why This Matters: Climate and Economic Implications

If sustainable fuels scale as the IEA projects, their uptake could be a critical bridging solution for hard-to-electrify sectors (aviation, shipping, some industrial processes), reducing lifecycle emissions where direct electrification is slow or impractical.

Economically, a growing sustainable-fuel industry could create value chains in feedstock collection (waste oils, residues), hydrogen production hubs, green ammonia, and e-fuel manufacturing — but those benefits depend on well-designed policies that steer investments toward low-emissions pathways and protect ecosystems.

Final Thoughts

“Sustainable fuel use by 2035” as a global objective is within sight under the IEA’s scenario — but it is conditional. The quadrupling outcome is not automatic; it requires coherent policy packages, substantial investment, and rigorous sustainability governance. If those pieces fall into place, sustainable fuels could be a major pillar of decarbonisation in the coming decade — especially where electrification alone cannot deliver deep emissions cuts.

FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)

1. What exactly does “sustainable fuel” mean in the IEA analysis?

The IEA uses “sustainable fuels” to cover a range of low-emissions liquid and gaseous fuels, including advanced biofuels, biogases, and hydrogen-derived fuels produced with low lifecycle emissions — subject to sustainability criteria.

2. How realistic is a fourfold increase by 2035?

Technically feasible under the IEA’s modelling, but it depends on fully implementing current and announced policies, scaling investments, and resolving feedstock and sustainability constraints. The IEA explicitly describes the pathway as conditional on those policy actions.

3. Will sustainable fuels make a big dent in global emissions?

They can significantly reduce emissions in sectors that are hard to electrify (aviation, shipping, some industries), but their climate benefit hinges on lifecycle emissions — and on avoiding land-use and biodiversity harms. Proper lifecycle accounting and safeguards are essential.

4. Who is investing in this shift?

Governments and major energy companies are increasing commitments: clean energy investment is rising (IEA projects USD 3.3 trillion in energy flows in 2025 with large clean allocations), and oil majors have announced dozens of biofuel/SAF projects toward 2030.

5. What are the main policy levers to accelerate sustainable fuel uptake?

Key tools include blending mandates and procurement targets (e.g., SAF mandates), low-carbon fuel standards, investment incentives for hydrogen and electrolysers, feedstock sustainability rules, and international cooperative frameworks for standards and trade.",https://sigmaearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/word-image-79488-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-27 16:00:04.655814

An annual report by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) into the uptake of alternative fuels, known as “sustainable” aviation fuel (SAF) by the industry, said that the new ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation has “stimulated increased SAF production” within the EU.

The regulation established the “blending mandate”, which sets the mandatory minimum percentage for the use of alternative aviation fuels by airlines. This came into force at 2 per cent of all fuel used in 2025 and is due to increase to 6 per cent by 2030 before accelerating to 20 per cent in 2035 and 70 per cent by 2050.

Earlier this month, leading European airlines warned that without increased support for alternative aviation fuels from the EU there would be rising costs - leading to reduced air travel accessibility and connectivity across Europe.

But the EU is striking a more optimistic tone, with sustainable transport and tourism commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas emphasising that it was “making steady progress in adopting sustainable aviation fuels”.

“The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation is already helping to increase SAF production and use across member states,” added Tzitzikostas. “Our focus now is on supporting the industry and member states to ensure a smooth and fair transition to cleaner aviation fuels.""

The EASA report found that nearly all SAF used in the EU during 2024 was biofuel, with 81 per cent produced from used cooking oil and another 17 per cent from waste animal fat.

But the agency noted that the alternative aviation fuel market “remains concentrated” with 25 suppliers providing SAF to 33 airports in 12 countries during 2024. Airports in just five member states - France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain and Sweden – received 99 per cent of all supply.

Alternative fuel accounted for only 0.6 per cent of all aviation fuel supplied at EU airports last year, which reduced CO2 emissions by around 714 kilotonnes – equivalent to 10,000 flights between Madrid and Paris. But the average price of SAF (€2,085 per tonne) was nearly three times higher than conventional jet fuel (€734 per tonne).

EASA’s next annual report will use 2025 data to assess whether the first blending mandate target of 2 per cent has been achieved.

Maria Rueda, EASA’s safety management, sustainability and global outreach director, said: “This first annual technical report marks an important milestone and makes clear that the EU has taken important first steps.

Earlier this week, plans to fast-track Heathrow’s third runway were announced. While there has been much conjecture on the increased emissions and air pollution that such an upgrade will bring, there’s another source of pollution that, for many, slips under the environmental protection radar: noise.

According to the Airports Commission, a third runway at Heathrow would expose 12,000 to 28,000 more people to noise impacts exceeding 70 decibels. As well as this, a third runway would lead to 300,000 people experiencing being flown over by aircraft for the first time.

Already, reports state Heathrow has noise levels classified as ‘significantly annoying’ that impact more people than any other airport in Europe.

However, in order to assess the adverse impact of aircraft noise in the UK, government policy has established that the lowest observed adverse level effect is 51dB for an average summer day, and 45 dB for a summer night.

Crucially, this doesn’t mean that noise above these levels will not be allowed. But it does mean that noise will play an important role as a factor in planning decisions within that area (such as airport expansion). There may also be support available for residents for noise mitigation, such as double glazing.

What are the impacts of aircraft noise pollution?

Aircraft noise is a serious public health issue. In the UK, more than one million people are exposed to aircraft noise above levels recommended for the protection of health.

Around 460 schools around Heathrow are exposed to aircraft noise that ‘impede memory and learning’.

As well as this, one large-scale study around Heathrow found people living under the flight path were 10 to 20 per cent more at risk of stroke and heart disease than those not living under the flight path.

Another study by UCL found that those who lived in areas with higher than recommended aircraft noise levels had stiffer and thicker heart muscles that contracted and expanded less easily and were less efficient at pumping blood around the body, compared to those who lived in lower aircraft noise areas.

Emerging studies also link aircraft noise to poor mental health, such as increases in stress and anxiety.

How is noise pollution mitigated?

The UK Government have a framework used to ensure aviation noise remains at a limit. Its main aim is ‘to limit, and where possible, reduce the number of people in the UK significantly affected by aircraft noise’.

To do this, a range of measures is in place. Through planning decisions, governments aim to limit the impact of noise in any new development. As well as this, plans to work with the aviation industry to encourage the development of quieter aircraft are already in place.

As engines become sleeker, noise pollution reduces. For example, Airbus’s A320neo reduces noise with a new engine, lowering it by 50 per cent from the maximum 85dB of the previous A320 model.

While these measures may help to reduce some aviation noise, for the thousands of individuals living below flight paths, it may not be enough. Ultimately, they are still subjected to loud, disturbing and health-impacting noises.",https://geographical.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/heathrow-2.webp,N,,2025-10-27 16:00:13.041271

Held during Manufacturing Month in October, the contest celebrates California’s world-class manufacturing sector and its vital role in driving innovation and economic growth across the state.

A global leader in aerospace and defense

California is home to one-third of the nation’s space technology companies and employs more aerospace engineers and defense personnel than any other state. Global security and aerospace leader Lockheed Martin supports thousands of highly-skilled jobs across multiple facilities dedicated to advanced research, design, manufacturing, and flight testing – including its renowned Skunk Works site in Palmdale, where the X-59 is being developed.

For more than a decade, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works and NASA have collaborated to solve one of the most persistent challenges of supersonic flight – the sonic boom. Skunk Works is leading the design, build, and flight testing of the X-59 quiet supersonic technology aircraft, which will be used to collect community responses to its low-noise sonic “thump”. The findings will provide NASA with the critical data required to help approve new rules that will allow quiet commercial supersonic flight over land. This milestone could unlock a new global market for aircraft manufacturers and enable passengers to travel anywhere in the world in half the time it takes today.

A total of 170 prospective investors and representatives from various national government agencies, local government units, investment promotion agencies, and nongovernment organizations attended the event.

Finland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided support through the BOI-Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI)’s Green Transition Investment Program (GTIP).

The forum facilitated dialogue among government, industry, and development partners to boost the Philippine SAF ecosystem.

SAF is a low-carbon aviation fuel made from non-petroleum sources like used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and captured carbon. It is called a “drop-in“ fuel — blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft and infrastructure without major modifications.

It reduces the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of air travel compared to fossil fuels, in some cases able to achieve a net-negative carbon footprint.

Officials of some of its early proponents, such as SAFAsia’s Ditmar Gorges Alcom’s Prateek Tiwari, and Cavitoil Basura Power’s Bart Cassineli, joined a panel discussion on opportunities and challenges in local SAF production.

“For the Philippines, SAF offers an opportunity to demonstrate our leadership in the global effort to combat climate change, transforming a worldwide challenge into a national economic opportunity,” BOI Executive Director Ma. Corazon Halili-Dichosa said.

The BOI is encouraging SAF investments through the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (Create) Act and the Renewable Energy (RE) Law.

The Create Act lowers corporate income taxes to 25 percent, and those of small, medium and micro enterprises to 20 percent.

RE projects using solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass sources are granted a maximum of seven years’ income tax holiday, special corporate income tax rate or enhanced deductions, value added tax and duty perks, among other benefits.

Partnerships

In the second panel discussion, representatives from BOI, Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), Asian Development Bank, and Central Luzon State University provided insights on development pathways and partnership opportunities for SAF in the Philippines.

BOI Resource-Based Industries Service (RBIS) Acting Director Francis Peñaflor expounded on fiscal incentives for SAF investments.

CAAP’s Katherine Barcellana explained the SAF roadmap and policy developments in the country; ADB Climate Change Specialist Yeon Su Kim presented financing options; and CLSU president Wendy Mateo talked about abundant local SAF feedstocks.

The facility is equipped with standardised processes and updated technologies consistent with other Airbus locations.

It also incorporates renewable electricity, reclaimed water, and geothermal energy as part of ongoing environmental initiatives.

The addition of this new assembly line brings Airbus’s total final assembly lines worldwide to ten, including existing sites in Hamburg (Germany), two in Toulouse (France), Mobile (US), and two in Tianjin.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said: “We welcome the addition of Tianjin’s second line to our global production system, as it provides us with the necessary flexibility and capacity to deliver on our plan to assemble 75 A320 Family aircraft per month in 2027.

“Over the past 40 years of our presence here in the country, we have come a long way in establishing trustful partnerships with the China civil aviation community, and we look forward to writing the next chapters of our future together.”

Since its initial opening in 2008, the Tianjin site has assembled and delivered more than 780 A320 Family aircraft.

It was Airbus’s first commercial aircraft production site outside Europe.

In 2025, Airbus marked 40 years since the delivery of its first aircraft to the Chinese market.

Recently, Airbus and the Cathay Group announced a joint investment of up to $70m to advance the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) both in Asia and globally.

The Department for Transport (DfT) proposes a variable levy on suppliers in the consultation published this month, with the costs passed “through the supply chain and on to consumers”.

It notes the extent to which costs are passed on will depend on “consumers’ sensitivity to price changes” and the level of competition, suggesting: “It will be a commercial decision for aviation fuel suppliers whether they pass on some or all costs to airlines.”

However, it assumes they “will pass on 100%” of the cost, calculating this will lead to “a small impact on ticket prices”.

An indicative table of levy payments based on 2024 data suggests the costs will amount to more than £55 million a year for large fuel suppliers, £22 million for medium-size producers and £5.5 million for small producers.

The government proposes an additional amount to cover unforeseen costs and to mitigate the risk of under-collection, noting a need for cash reserves and mutualisation of the costs of supplier failures or defaults.

It estimates the costs of a large supplier failure in a single year at £21 million.

These costs will be on top of the price of SAF itself, which Iata reported was more than three times the cost of jet fuel last year, adding $1.6 billion to carriers’ fuel bills.

Iata estimates the cost of SAF in Europe this year at $1.2 billion, with an additional $1.7 billion in ‘compliance fees’, for which it blames the UK and EU’s SAF mandates suggesting these “have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel”.

Airlines must purchase one million tonnes of SAF to meet the requirements of the mandates this year.

Iata notes the cost of SAF in Europe has doubled since the mandates were introduced in January owing to “the compliance fees SAF producers or suppliers are charging” to cover their potential costs.

The UK and EU mandates require SAF to comprise 2% of fuel on all departing flights over the course of this year, rising to 6% in the EU and 10% in the UK by 2030.

High level of compliance critical

The DfT Levy Design Consultation sets out the arrangements for and potential impact of the levy to fund its SAF Revenue Certainty Mechanism, with supplier contributions based on market share and fuel volumes.

It proposes a ‘forecast levy rate’ to provide a guide on future costs and options for mitigating financial risks, administering the levy and enforcing compliance.

The government notes: “It is critical the design of the levy promotes a high level of compliance and responds to non-compliance effectively.”

It proposes “regular public reporting on the extent of non-compliance and actions taken in response” arguing this will act as “a reputational deterrent” but also advocates “a suite of enforcement measures”.

The secretary of state would have the power to impose fines of up to £100,000 or 10% of annual turnover on companies in breach of the levy requirements.

The consultation is due to close on January 8. The DfT said it expects to publish a response next year and is committed to passing “all necessary legislation” for the mechanism to be in place by the end of 2026.",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/074/Shutterstock-airline-fuel_Main.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 14:00:55.779948

The COP30 climate summit will be held between November 10 and 21 in Belem, Brazil, which is a global leader in biofuels production and use.

“I think there will be more focus on the social aspect of the transition and also on the sustainable use of biomass,” La Camera said at an energy conference in Singapore on Monday, as carried by Reuters.

The participants in the summit would debate biofuels and potentially include a biofuels target in the final declaration, according to IRENA’s chief. The goal could be boosting biofuels production four times by 2035 or setting a target for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) share in the global energy mix, La Camera said.

Brazil last month launched the Belém Commitment for Sustainable Fuels—known as Belém 4x—an initiative aimed at building high-level political support for the global goal of quadrupling the production and use of sustainable fuels by 2035.

Last month, IRENA and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) launched a financing initiative to support SAF and clean aviation energy projects globally.

The push toward increased biofuel production and use comes amid major oil firms ditching biofuel projects. Shell last month abandoned plans to proceed with the construction of a biofuels facility at its Shell Energy and Chemicals Park in Rotterdam, amid challenging market conditions that makes the project uncompetitive.

BP also cancelled plans for a major biofuels facility at its Rotterdam refinery, scoring another setback for Europe’s drive to scale advanced biofuels.

Earlier this month, IRENA, the COP30 Brazilian Presidency, and the Global Renewables Alliance (GRA) said in a report that the world is falling behind on its renewable energy and efficiency goals despite record progress last year.

The global progress report flagged bottlenecks in investment, grids, and supply chains, and urged governments for bolder renewable targets before COP30.

The agreement was announced in Hong Kong on the sidelines of the IATA World Sustainability Symposium at a ceremony hosted by Cathay Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer Alex McGowan and Airbus President Asia-Pacific Anand Stanley.

Under the terms of the partnership, the two companies will collaborate to identify, evaluate and invest in projects that support the scaling of SAF production towards 2030 and beyond. Projects will be assessed based on their commercial viability, technology maturity, and potential for long-term offtake.

Scaling SAF requires deep collaboration across the value chain, including from policymakers and investors to SAF producers and customers. This co-investment agreement reflects the spirit of partnership with Airbus and Cathay teaming up to accelerate production capability for more meaningful impact.

“SAF remains the most important lever for Cathay and the wider aviation industry to drive toward our decarbonization goals,” said Alex McGowan, Chief Operations & Service Delivery Officer, Cathay. “This co-investment partnership with Airbus underscores our commitment to building a stronger, more scalable SAF industry. It complements our broader strategy of investing in the technologies and production capacity needed for the future, including our recent investment in the oneworld BEV SAF Fund. Meanwhile we are expanding SAF usage today through partnerships with like-minded organizations.”

“This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference,” said Anand Stanley, President Asia Pacific, Airbus. “The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyze production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers.”

The joint commitment also includes collaboration to advocate for supportive SAF policies on both the supply and demand side across Asia. With the region’s strong potential in feedstock supply, production capacity, and its vibrant aviation market, Airbus and Cathay aim to leverage their global experience to help shape policies that make SAF more accessible and affordable in this part of the world.

Airbus and Cathay have a long-standing partnership dating back to 1989, when the airline signed its first order for Airbus aircraft. Today, the Cathay Group operates 86 Airbus aircraft with > 70 more on order for future delivery.

The review was commissioned by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) in February 2025 and was led by former Labour shadow energy minister Alan Whitehead.

GGRs useful for preventing GHGs from entering atmosphere

Greenhouse gas removal technologies, also known as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), are being deployed in the UK to enable the continued burning of natural gas without releasing the associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere, which would otherwise accelerate climate breakdown.

While there are plenty of technological solutions to replacing natural gas as a source of electricity generation, such as renewable energy and battery storage, CCUS is also used to mitigate the GHG emissions of hard-to-abate sectors such as cement production.

In September 2025, Heidelberg Materials UK’s carbon capture and storage (CCS) project to decarbonise a cement works achieved its final investment decision (FID).

GGRs critical to achieving net zero – review

Introducing the report, Whitehead said: “Do we need GGRs to get us to net zero? All the evidence points to a firm ‘yes’, unless we can contemplate a low-carbon future with no industry, little transport and difficult-to-swallow mass behaviour change.

“Estimates of the ‘gap’ left after all reasonable steps to decarbonise have been taken vary, but all conclude that the only way to overcome the ‘emissions gap’ is to deploy to varying degrees the sheaf of removal technologies now being developed.”

The review concluded that “without GGRs we cannot meet net zero, and the value of doing so in a way that achieves geological net zero”, however, it added “that there is no silver bullet” to decarbonising the economy.

It presented a series of recommendations to the government. It said the “government should develop a GGR Strategy to outline the contribution of GGR solutions required to meet carbon budgets and net zero”.

In addition, the review said the government should “establish an Office for Greenhouse Gas Removals to produce more coordinated action on GGRs, and to enable quicker and more efficient rollout of policy and project deployment”.

The government has recently said that it wants to reduce the number of quangos (quasi-autonomous non-government organisations). That didn’t stop it from recently creating the Office for Clean Energy Jobs (OCEJ) to help deliver the 400,000 new clean energy jobs by 2030 which it says are needed for the journey to net zero.

The review added that the government “should adopt a strategic aim to minimise the use of imported biomass feedstocks” and it should “amend and rename the SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] Mandate to become a Net Zero Aviation Mandate, with a trajectory that means that by 2045 all flights taking off from the UK are made climate neutral.

“The amended Mandate should drive procurement of both SAF and permanent GGRs, with competition between these solutions.”

The final recommendation was that the government should “exploit UK growth opportunities” by making the UK a leader in deploying and promoting GGR technologies.

CCUS industry welcomes review and pledges to promote the technology

CCSA (Carbon Capture and Storage Association) UK director Mark Sommerfeld said: “The Independent Review of Greenhouse Gas Removals marks a pivotal step in the UK’s net zero journey.

“Technologies such as Bioenergy with CCS, Direct Air Capture with Storage and Energy from Waste with CCS are essential to tackling residual emissions, addressing industrial decarbonisation and securing a reliable, low-carbon energy system.

“The Review outlines a clear path to scale these solutions, with success hinging on a credible business model, investment certainty and robust CO₂ transport and storage infrastructure.

“With vast CO₂ storage potential, established CCUS infrastructure and world-leading low-carbon expertise, the UK has a real opportunity to be a global leader in high-integrity carbon removals.

“We look forward to working with the government and industry to deliver 5 Mtpa of engineered removals by 2030, rising to 23 Mtpa by 2035 – boosting growth, energy security and addressing climate change as global demand for GGR credits surges.”

Review ‘blinkered by a silo mentality’ – anti-CCUS campaign

Scrap Carbon Capture campaign lead campaigner Andrew Boswell said: “Dr Whitehead’s review is blinkered by a silo mentality.

“It treats greenhouse-gas removals (GGRs) as a standalone fix while ignoring the huge externalities built into relying on the Government’s CCS network to deliver them.

“Every UK cluster is front-loaded with fossil-fuel anchor projects that lock in decades of methane-leaking LNG imports and billions in public subsidies ultimately paid by consumers.

“Whitehead calls for faster CCUS expansion but never counts the carbon or economic cost of that dependence.

“He also sidesteps the Drax issue — the UK’s biggest emitter being re-badged as our flagship BECCS [Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage] project, fuelled by imported forest biomass.

“And his proposal to use GGRs to offset aviation growth misuses scarce removal capacity: these technologies should be for cleaning the atmosphere, not for licensing airport expansion.

“Until we decouple GGR policy from fossil and aviation interests, we’re subsidising the problem, not the solution.”

Minister says government will continue to improve GGR deployment

Energy minister Michael Shanks said: “Greenhouse Gas Removal technologies have the potential to propel us towards our climate targets, as the UK continues to be a world leader on climate action, protecting current and future generations.

“The report recognises the important role GGR technologies can play in delivering clean power and net zero. Already, we are investing in first-of-a-kind carbon capture projects in the UK, – creating thousands of jobs in North Wales, the North West and Teesside.

“We will take the time to carefully consider these findings and consider how best to use these technologies to deliver climate action, good jobs and energy security for the country.”",https://cdn.ca.emap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2009/05/carbon.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 12:02:59.704072

Indian refiners are likely to scale back on the import of Russian oil to avoid secondary sanctions on shipping and banking after the US imposed fresh sanctions with a view to curbing Moscow's earnings from oil sales.

""We will abide by all sanctions imposed by the international community,"" he said.

He, however, refused to comment on the IOC's purchases of Russian oil.

Russian oil made up for 21 per cent of the crude oil IOC imports during April-September.

IOC's subsidiary Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd (CPCL) has halved Russian oil imports this month, coinciding with the fresh sanctions the US imposed on Russian oil.

US President Donald Trump, late October 22, imposed sanctions on Russia's Rosneft and Lukoil, in a bid to pressure Moscow into ending its war on Ukraine. A day later, the European Union imposed full transaction bans on Rosneft and Russian gas firm Gazprom Neft.

While the Indian government has not officially responded to the sanctions announced by the US, industry sources said Indian refiners' import strategy would largely depend on how banking systems respond to the latest restrictions.

Reliance Industries Ltd, which has a 25-year term contract with Rosneft to buy up to 5,00,000 barrels per day of crude and is India's largest importer of Russian oil, may be the first company to stop importing oil from Moscow.

Last week, Reliance pledged full compliance with the Western sanctions on Russian crude imports while expressing confidence that its diversified sourcing strategy will maintain operational stability.

The company, which operates the world's largest refining complex at Gujarat's Jamnagar with 1.24 million barrels per day capacity, said it will adapt its refinery operations to meet new compliance requirements following restrictions announced by the EU, UK and the US.

Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy, which is currently dependent solely on Russian oil after supplies from elsewhere dried up due to sanctions by the European Union, has very few options.

A potential disruption in discounted Russian Urals supplies could trim Indian refiners' gross margins, with the grade making up roughly 40 per cent of their crude slate.

Indian refiners have started diversifying their crude import baskets in the third quarter, importing larger volumes from Colombia, Canada and the Middle East as inflows from Russia dipped. India's Russian crude imports in July-September averaged 1.68 million bpd, a 13 per cent decline compared to Q2.

Long reliant on Middle Eastern oil, India began importing large volumes of steeply discounted Russian crude in 2022 after Western sanctions restricted Moscow's traditional markets. At one point, Russian oil made up about 40 per cent of crude that Indian refiners processed and turned into fuels like petrol and diesel.

Russia currently supplies about a third of India's crude imports, averaging around 1.75 million barrels per day (mbd) in 2025, of which approximately 1.2 mbd came directly from Rosneft and Lukoil. Most of these volumes were bought by private refiners, Reliance Industries Ltd and Nayara Energy, with smaller allocations to state-owned refiners.

Despite tightened sanctions and the US slapping a steep 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods, India's imports of Russian crude between January and September 2025 were only 4.6 per cent lower than 1.83 million bpd a year earlier.

Russian crude flows are expected to remain in the 1.6-1.8 mbd range until November 21, but direct volumes from Rosneft and Lukoil are likely to decline thereafter, as Indian refiners seek to avoid any risk of US sanctions, Sumit Ritolia, Lead Research Analyst (Refining and Modelling) at Kpler, said last week.

The move, announced by the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) and JTC Corporation on Monday, October 27, marks a new phase in the transformation of the country’s main industrial hub.

The government plans to allocate about 300 hectares of land on the western part of Jurong Island for renewable power generation and the production of low-carbon fuels. This area represents around 10 per cent of the island’s total 3,000-hectare space.

Jurong Island currently serves as the centre of Singapore’s energy and chemicals industry and is home to major refineries operated by ExxonMobil, Chevron, and PetroChina.

Officials said the island will serve as a global testing ground for low-carbon technologies and next-generation energy solutions. The new zone will support the scaling up of facilities focused on renewable energy sources such as solar power, sustainable aviation fuel, and ammonia-based solutions that can be used for power generation and maritime fuel. It will also include battery storage systems and hydrogen-ready power plants to support future energy needs.

In addition to the renewable energy projects, another 20 hectares of land will be developed into Singapore’s largest data centre park. The new facility is expected to provide up to 700 megawatts of power capacity. Operators will have access to Jurong Island’s established energy and utility network, including shared power storage systems and links to low-carbon energy sources.

Authorities said the expansion aligns with Singapore’s broader goal of balancing industrial growth with sustainability and innovation. Jurong Island will continue to attract investment in specialty chemicals and sustainable products while also building infrastructure to support the energy transition.

Demand for advanced chemical products is rising across the region, and Singapore aims to position itself as a key supplier of high-quality materials. The island’s existing ecosystem and power capacity are seen as strong foundations for companies looking to scale operations in Asia.

Meanwhile, local energy company Sembcorp Industries has introduced a vertical battery stacking solution at its Jurong Island energy storage facility. The upgrade increases the system’s storage capacity from 285 megawatt-hours to 326 megawatt-hours, boosting efficiency without expanding the site’s physical footprint.

With these initiatives, Jurong Island is set to evolve into a more diversified energy and technology hub, supporting Singapore’s long-term plans for a low-carbon and digitally connected economy.",https://www.connectedtoindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jurong_Island_Singapore_-_20110227-01.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 13:02:03.672426

Dive Brief:

Houston-based oil and convenience retailer Par Pacific Holdings has closed a $100 million deal to build the largest renewable fuels manufacturing facility in Hawai’i, the company announced last week.

The facility in Kapolei is expected to be built by the end of 2025 and will produce roughly 61 million gallons per year of renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, renewable naphtha and low carbon liquified petroleum gases.

The deal marks new territory for Par Pacific, whose profitable retail arm has become one of the quieter success stories in the c-store industry.

Dive Insight:

Par Pacific’s latest initiative was revealed in July when the company, alongside Japanese trading and petroleum firms Mitsubishi Corp. and Eneos, agreed to establish a joint venture to produce renewable fuels at Par Pacific’s refinery in Kapolei. As part of the deal, Mitsubishi and Eneos would form Alohi Renewable Energy, LLC, which would acquire a 36.5% equity stake in the venture for $100 million, while Par Pacific would retain the remaining interest and lead the project’s operations.

It’s unclear how the facility will impact Par Pacific’s convenience retailing network in Hawai’i, which includes about 89 locations under the company’s Hele banner. Back in July, Par Pacific said the facility “will contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions while providing reliable transportation and utility fuels to Hawaii consumers.”

“We are thrilled to partner with Mitsubishi and ENEOS through the formation of this strategic joint venture,” Will Monteleone, president and CEO of Par Pacific, said in July. “Creating the Hawaii Renewables joint venture brings together the best of our three organizations and yields additional scale and expertise across feedstock origination, commercial optimization, and market access throughout the Pacific Basin.”

Besides its locations in Hawai’i, Par Pacific operates another roughly 30 c-stores across Idaho, and Washington under the Nomnom and 76 banners.

Green Shipping Corridors: the model for immediate progress Through its investment in true Green Shipping Corridors, NatPower Marine is connecting high-traffic maritime routes with clean electricity for propulsion and cold ironing, replacing fossil-fuel use both in port and on near-shore legs.
NatPower Marine believes the IMO’s delay could, paradoxically, open space for innovation and collaboration.
Redefining the Green Corridor Sommadossi said the events of the past week should also trigger a broader rethink of what constitutes a truly green shipping corridor.
The future of green shipping will be built, not negotiated.”","Member States of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have voted to delay for one year the adoption of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, which would have created the world’s first truly global carbon-pricing mechanism for shipping. The decision, taken at the second extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC/ES.2) held in London from 14–17 October 2025, marks a setback for international decarbonization efforts, in favor of a status quo that benefit oil and gas producers but not shipowners, investors and ports already under pressure to meet tightening emissions targets.

The postponement leaves the sector without a formal global market framework just as regional regulation is gathering pace, from Europe’s maritime carbon pricing to new clean-port standards in Asia and North America. NatPower Marine said the outcome underlines the growing gap between political negotiation and industry action, as ports and shipping lines continue to invest in clean-energy infrastructure despite the lack of a global mechanism.

Stefano D.M. Sommadossi, CEO of NatPower Marine and NatPower UK, said: “While the IMO’s postponement is disappointing, it cannot be a pause button for the industry. Shore power and near-shore electrification are proven, scalable and capable of delivering deep emissions cuts today. Every corridor we electrify removes thousands of tons of CO2, NOx and SOx from the system while improving air quality for coastal communities. The opportunity to lead is now, not in a year’s time.”

He continued: “No sector has got regulation before innovation, it has always been the other way round. Airplanes, cars, radio, Internet, AI were invented and adopted before regulation, and regulation followed the path set by innovators.

It is clear that the larger players and most innovative shipping operators and owners have already decided to go green because it is a strategic advantage and a cost cutting option in the years to come. So innovators and initiators will progress during this regulatory postponement. We at NatPower are accelerating our plan to deliver near shore electric propulsion and cold ironing in 120 locations globally.”

The potential losers of this postponement are the emerging countries that were relying on IMO global carbon pricing to finance investments. The good news is that those investments can be made with private capital, provided that their locations are included in the green corridors and routes of the initiators.

New electric fuel for ships is already benefitting from the sheer convenience and it is a low hanging fruit for decarbonization, and it is happening right now. Without waiting to choose among different alternative cleaner molecules (e-methanol, ammonia and hydrogen), the immediate opportunity is near shore electric propulsions and cold ironing.

The existing regulations in EU and China, and their ambitions to become the powerhouses of Energy Transition, are more than sufficient to trigger adoption and change.

Across Europe, Asia and the Americas, a wave of electrification projects, from single-port upgrades to full Green Corridors, is building a global network of clean maritime routes. It shows what genuine international cooperation can achieve when backed by real infrastructure and investment.

Green Shipping Corridors: the model for immediate progress

Through its investment in true Green Shipping Corridors, NatPower Marine is connecting high-traffic maritime routes with clean electricity for propulsion and cold ironing, replacing fossil-fuel use both in port and on near-shore legs. The company is planning to invest more than £3 billion to deliver 120 clean-port locations by 2030, creating an integrated global network of zero-emission maritime energy hubs.

For example, the corridor between Heysham Port and Northern Ireland, developed in partnership with Peel Ports Group, has started construction. It will eliminate more than 10,000 tons of CO2 annually from Irish Sea routes and forms part of a wider £250 million UK rollout of shore-power and e-ship-charging infrastructure.

Sommadossi said: “The IMO’s delay underlines the challenge of reaching consensus at a global level. But while negotiations stall, regional regulation is accelerating, and the landscape is becoming more fragmented. The EU Emissions Trading System now prices maritime emissions, and FuelEU Maritime sets carbon-intensity limits for vessels trading in Europe. The UK is preparing to bring shipping into its own ETS, Singapore is expanding its network of green corridors, and California is already enforcing at-berth emission rules. The message is clear: decarbonization is no longer waiting for a single global mechanism, it is happening route by route, region by region.”

This patchwork of regional measures is driving urgency for practical, scalable solutions that can operate across multiple regulatory systems. As global policy tightens, the infrastructure to deliver compliance and emissions reduction is struggling to keep pace, creating both challenge and opportunity for the industry.

That urgency is echoed in new research showing the accelerating pace of green-shipping regulation and innovation worldwide.

According to the World Maritime University (WMU) and the Shanghai International Shipping Institute (SISI) in their Global Green Shipping Development Report (2024–2025), regulatory pressure on ports and shipping is now accelerating across all major economies.

The WMU/SISI report also confirms that ports are increasingly being recognized as the key enablers of maritime decarbonization, with shore power expected to become a mandatory standard in many jurisdictions. The study highlights that “ships in ports will use more shore power or zero-carbon energy in the future” as emission requirements tighten, a view strongly echoed by NatPower Marine.

“This global trend validates our approach,” said Sommadossi. “Shore power and e-charging infrastructure are not optional extras; they are the foundation for clean shipping. Every port that plugs, in our standardized network, becomes part of the global energy transition.”

Energy integration: powering the maritime transition

To ensure clean electricity is available where and when vessels need it, NatPower Marine is supported by 20 GW of renewable generation and over 100 GWh of battery-storage capacity developed by its parent, NatPower Group. Located in strategic coastal regions, these assets deliver stable, low-cost renewable power through private-wire connections and smart Power Purchase Agreements, supporting vessel charging and port operations without burdening national grids.

This integrated approach forms what Sommadossi describes as “the backbone of a clean-shipping network,” linking renewable generation directly to maritime demand and enabling real decarbonization today.

NatPower Marine believes the IMO’s delay could, paradoxically, open space for innovation and collaboration. While waiting for a global mechanism, countries, ports and fleets can lead the way and show what success looks like by developing their own clean-energy routes, projects that cut emissions while creating industrial and economic growth.

Redefining the Green Corridor

Sommadossi said the events of the past week should also trigger a broader rethink of what constitutes a truly green shipping corridor.

“So far, most green corridors have been defined around alternative fuels and fuel-supply routes,” he said. “But that only addresses part of the challenge. A true green corridor must include the full chain of clean-energy infrastructure, from shore power and propulsion charging to renewable generation and grid integration. That is the only way to deliver zero-emission voyages from berth to berth, at an affordable cost.”

He added that NatPower Marine’s approach, combining e-ship charging, port-grid integration and large-scale battery storage, offers a practical blueprint for this next generation of corridors.

“If the past week has shown anything,” he concluded, “it is that we cannot wait for definitions and policy to catch up with reality. The future of green shipping will be built, not negotiated.”",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Stefano-Sommadossi-CEO-NatPower.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 10:56:30.578403

Whitehead concluded that while BECCS has a role, it should just complement the UK’s carbon removal strategy.","A sweeping government-commissioned review has called for a reset of the UK carbon removal strategy — and it could soon force airlines to pay directly for their emissions.

The independent report, led by former MP Dr. Alan Whitehead for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, urges the government to establish a “net zero aviation mandate” that would make the aviation sector fund verified carbon dioxide removal (CDR) projects, including direct air capture and green gas initiatives.

While airlines are already required to use at least 10% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030, Whitehead’s review recommends giving operators flexibility: use less SAF if they offset emissions through CDR credits. The goal, he said, is to ensure “polluters pay” for the hardest-to-abate emissions, such as those from long-haul flights.

Aviation is projected to be the UK’s largest source of residual emissions by 2050, yet demand continues to grow with new runways approved at Heathrow and Gatwick. The review concedes that curbing air travel is politically unlikely, making removals essential to meeting carbon budgets.

Not all UK carbon removal created equal

Beyond aviation, the nearly 200-page report calls for a national greenhouse gas removal (GGR) strategy and the creation of an Office for GGR, warning that the UK’s current focus on large industrial clusters neglects smaller, scalable solutions.

The Carbon Capture and Storage Association welcomed the publication: “Today’s publication of the Independent Review of Greenhouse Gas Removals marks a pivotal moment for the UK’s net zero transition. GGRs, including BECCS, DACCS, and WECCS, are essential technologies to remove residual emissions from hard-to-abate sectors, support industrial decarbonisation and maintain a reliable, low-carbon energy system.

The UK has a real opportunity to cement its position as a global leader in high-integrity carbon removals, thanks to its large CO2 storage capacity, existing CCUS infrastructure, advanced low-carbon technology expertise and a supportive policy and regulatory environment that can attract private investment and accelerate deployment … With global demand for GGR credits growing – nearly 10 million purchased worldwide – the UK has a clear opportunity to lead in high-integrity carbon removals.”

But the review did take a cautious stance on the UK’s reliance on biomass with carbon capture, warning that BECCS is unlikely to supply more than a small fraction of future clean power.

It urged policymakers to scale back support for large imported-biomass projects like Drax and to prioritise domestic feedstocks from agricultural residues instead. Whitehead concluded that while BECCS has a role, it should just complement the UK’s carbon removal strategy.

Whitehead also spotlighted carbon capture from energy-from-waste facilities as a promising, near-term emissions solution. The Protos incinerator in Ellesmere Port, run by Encyclis, recently became one of the UK’s first commercial-scale projects under the HyNet cluster. Companies like enfinium and Viridor have been actively working on deploying projects of their own.

The challenge here is that most waste plants sit outside such industrial hubs. The review warned that without a framework for non-pipeline CO2 transport — via ship, rail, or truck — many regional facilities will struggle to participate in the UK’s net-zero plans.

Whitehead urged ministers to “put removals on a firm footing” through stronger coordination, regulation reform, and clear market signals, including holding the aviation sector accountable for its carbon footprint.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jay-vicencio-7slin_liPnw-unsplash-scaled-e1761567769217.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 10:56:43.391000

Cathay is also a launch investor in the oneworld BEV SAF Fund, which is a joint initiative between Cathay with other oneworld airline members and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the climate investment firm founded by Bill Gates. The fund focuses on novel, next-generation SAF technologies with the potential to scale significantly and reduce costs.

Malaysia as a potential site for development of SAF

Malaysia has the potential to be one of the locations in Southeast Asia for Cathay Group and Airbus’s newly-announced co-investment projects in the development of SAF. Cathay Pacific general manager of sustainability Grace Cheung said the airline sees Malaysia and other countries in the region and globally as part of its potential project areas, as reported in Malaysia’s The New Straits Times.

“Malaysia and also many countries in the region are all part of where we have potential projects…The partnership that we have with Airbus definitely focuses on SAF development in the Asia region. So, not only limited to Hong Kong, not only limited to Asia but globally,” she said.

Meanwhile, Airbus said Asia holds immense potential for SAF development with about 40 per cent of the world’s feedstock resources located in the region.

Singapore’s levy to boost use of greener jet fuel not suitable elsewhere as it may dampen air travel: IATA

Singapore’s decision to impose a levy on travellers to raise the use of greener jet fuel may have a “dampening effect on air travel”, and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) may not recommend such a policy elsewhere, said the body’s official as reported in The Straits Times.

However, given Singapore’s land constraints and limited capacity in producing SAF, the levy – which would go to a fund to procure the fuel – would be suitable for the country, said Dr Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice-president for sustainability and chief economist.

On Oct 14, the Singapore Parliament passed a Bill to impose a fixed levy on all departing flights from 2026 to support airlines’ use of SAF. The target is for SAF to constitute one per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, with the goal raised to three to five per cent by 2030.

Preliminary estimates from the authorities are that economy-class passengers may incur an additional S$3 levy for short-haul flights, S$6 for medium-haul flights and S$16 for long-haul flights, such as those to Bangkok, Tokyo and London, respectively.",https://ftnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel_SAF.webp,N,,2025-10-27 12:03:13.593446

Besides Horizon, lead recipients of the grants, made under the Initiative for Sustainable Aviation Technology (INSAT) programme, include Flying Whales, Certification Center Canada (3C), BioFlight Fuels and Thales.

Horizon-led Project CRYSTAL, which also involves 3C and the University of Toronto, is intended to develop an all-weather propulsion system for electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) applications.

In its first phase, this will analyse the “viability of implementing advanced anti-icing, de-icing, and ice detection technologies” – including ice-phobic and electrothermal coating solutions developed by the University of Toronto – onto eVTOL aircraft.

A follow-on phase, supported by 3C, will “focus on testing and analysing the viability of the technologies on the Cavorite X7”, Horizon says.

Horizon will receive C$2 million in grants towards the total C$10.5 million project.

Capable of accommodating six passengers and one pilot on routes of up to 430nm (800km), the hybrid-electric Cavorite X7 uses an innovative system of electric-powered fans in the wings and canard to achieve vertical lift. Forward propulsion comes from a single pusher-configured propeller driven by a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 thermal engine.

Horizon is targeting certification and service entry for the Cavorite X7 by the end of the decade.

Also included in the latest round of INSAT initiatives – the programme’s third – are trials of sustainable aviation fuel, the development of ground testing infrastructure for new propulsion systems, and flight-control technology for the Flying Whales LCA60T cargo airship.

This will see the Canadian arms of French firms Flying Whales and Thales work together to develop the flight-control, avionics, and electrical-distribution systems for the LCA60T.

“These systems are essential for operations, particularly while hovering for the load exchange operations,” the project abstract states.

Ground testing and demonstrations on a simulator will raise the systems to technology readiness level (TRL) 7 by the end of the project. First flight of the LCA60T is scheduled for 2027.

Meanwhile, Thales Canada, eVTOL developer Jaunt Air Mobility Canada, and vertiport provider Vertiko Mobilite are to collaborate on new detect-and-avoid technologies for eVTOL aircraft and unmanned air vehicles.

They’ve set their sights on North Las Vegas, Nevada, where a shiny new renewable fuels plant will spring to life. By turning waste biomass into renewable diesel, biomethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and leaning on hydrogen production through advanced electrolyzers, this joint venture is all about cutting carbon and boosting energy diversity.

Key Details at a Glance

Partnership: Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG), a leader in fuel cell technology and electrolysis; plus Edgewood Renewables, experts in biomass-to-fuels conversions.

Location: North Las Vegas, Nevada—home to about 274,000 people in the metro area and a hotspot for clean energy and industrial growth.

Feedstock: Local waste biomass—think farm leftovers, forestry scraps, and organic industrial byproducts.

Outputs: Renewable diesel, biomethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel tailored for trucking, aviation, and heavy industry craving low-carbon alternatives.

Timeline: Announced October 2025; groundbreaking slated for late 2025 once permits are in hand.

Objective: Ramp up domestic low-carbon fuel supply, meet soaring demand for zero-emission tech, and fortify U.S. energy security.

Inside the plant, Plug Power’s proprietary electrolyzer systems will produce green hydrogen on-site, which then reacts with biomass intermediates in a hydrotreating step. Over at Edgewood Renewables, they’ll deploy thermochemical magic—pyrolysis and gasification—to crack lignocellulosic material into bio-oils and syngas. Those building blocks get upgraded into drop-in fuels, clocking in at almost zero net carbon when paired with renewable hydrogen. You’ll see storage tanks for bio-oils, finished fuels, hydrogen compressors, and a control hub buzzing away, keeping an eye on all the numbers in real time.

Technologies in Focus

Electrolyzers: Devices that split water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity, the backbone of low-carbon hydrogen production.

Waste Biomass Conversion: Turning agricultural and forest residues plus industrial organic waste into fuel precursors via pyrolysis, gasification, or biochemical routes.

Fuel Cell Systems: Though mainly known for powering forklifts and vehicles, these units could also help run the plant or serve as backup power—underscoring the versatility of modern hydrogen infrastructure.

You might say this project captures a larger trend: hydrogen developers are branching into liquid fuels to tap existing distribution channels and meet tougher emissions rules. For Plug Power, famous for its material-handling fuel cells and green hydrogen ambitions, this move signals a strategic leap into renewable diesel and SAF territories. And with Edgewood Renewables’ knack for sourcing feedstocks and squeezing out top-tier conversion yields, the partnership feels like a perfect match.

Historical Context

Looking back over the last ten years, America’s clean energy story morphed from a solar-and-wind spotlight to include advanced biofuels. Legislative nudges—like federal tax credits for clean hydrogen (Section 45V) and low-carbon fuel standards—have been the wind in this sector’s sails. Now, projects that blend industrial decarbonization with circular feedstocks are getting more stage time. Plug Power’s dive into liquid fuels mirrors global shifts where ammonia and SAF are sharing the limelight with green hydrogen.

On the money side, Nevada’s Renewable Portfolio Standard and federal incentives tied to carbon intensity reduction are key. While the exact investment numbers are under wraps, industry folks expect a hefty capital injection—likely a cocktail of private equity, debt financing, and government subsidies—to make this plant a reality.

Regional Context & Policy

Nevada’s got sunshine in spades, plus mature industrial zones and a permitting process that won’t drag on forever. North Las Vegas sits smack in the middle of manufacturing hubs and logistics routes, giving easy access to biomass feedstocks and major markets in California, Arizona, and Utah. And let’s not forget the Port of Los Angeles link—not only could these fuels power American fleets, they might even head overseas.

State and local authorities have rolled out the red carpet with tax breaks and speedy zoning approvals. Between airlines and trucking companies clamoring for renewable diesel and SAF, Nevada has become a landing pad for trailblazing waste-to-fuel facilities.

Impact & Outlook

Here’s what we’re looking at:

Hundreds of construction and permanent operations jobs in Clark County.

Major cuts in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by displacing fossil diesel and jet fuel.

Lower particulate and NOx emissions in urban areas, thanks to cleaner-burning renewable diesel and SAF.

Stronger energy security through domestically produced drop-in fuels.

A beefed-up regional hydrogen infrastructure and a more circular waste economy.

Of course, it’s not all smooth sailing. Keeping a steady biomass supply and managing logistics will be a juggling act. Nailing down long-term offtake deals with airlines and trucking firms is critical for financing. Plus, syncing electrolyzer output with biomass processors means the engineering team will need to be spot-on balancing hydrogen and bio-oil flow rates.

Comparative Outlook

Many U.S. efforts zero in on standalone green hydrogen, but this Plug Power–Edgewood Renewables setup is a bit different. By marrying hydrogen production with biomass conversion, it offers a hybrid model that could become a go-to playbook. Imagine fuelling heavy-duty fleets at stations equipped with both renewable diesel and hydrogen blends—if this plant hits its performance and cost milestones, similar projects could pop up in biomass-rich regions, turbocharging America’s shift to low-carbon liquid fuels.

About the Companies

Plug Power, founded in 1997 and trading on NASDAQ (PLUG), builds electrolyzers, liquid hydrogen solutions, fuel cell systems, and hydrogen infrastructure, with deployments spanning material handling, stationary power, and mobility. Edgewood Renewables specializes in designing, developing, and operating renewable fuel facilities, turning waste biomass into renewable diesel, biomethanol, and SAF, all while focusing on sustainable feedstock sourcing and cutting-edge conversion techniques.

As permitting and financing wrap up, everyone’s got their eyes peeled. The first barrels are slated to roll out in the second half of 2026, and if all goes to plan, this plant could set a new bar for U.S. low-carbon fuel production—bridging clean electricity, waste valorization, and conventional fuel supply chains.",https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/vegas.jpeg,N,,2025-10-27 10:57:04.342386

We’re not lying when we say logistics is a complex world – and F1 logistics is a never-ending showcase of what complex, international logistics looks like.

Air freight While ocean freight beats at a steady rhythm that keeps the system alive, air freight is the fast pulse that powers each leg of the calendar.
At the same time, air freight flies in from Saudi Arabia, converging in time for the setup on the Miami waterfront.","A Formula 1 race may be decided in milliseconds, but the sport’s biggest challenge happens long before the lights go out – and long after the wheel-to-wheel action ends.

Behind every grand prix lies a logistical feat of global proportions: 24 races, 5 continents, 21 countries, and up to 1,200 metric tons of equipment per event in 2025 – with 3 triple-headers and 5 double-headers. From cars and pit garages to broadcast centers and hospitality suites, every piece must arrive precisely where and when it’s needed.

That’s where DHL comes in. As Official Logistics Partner of F1, we begin planning each season a year in advance – mapping out a mix of sea, air, and road freight to ensure everything is in place for the start of each race. This multimodal logistics solution also keeps costs in check and supports the sustainability goals of F1.

It’s a carefully choreographed symphony of movements across sea, air, and land – balancing speed, volume, cost, and sustainability. And it’s what makes the Race Behind the Race as extraordinary as the spectacle on track. Discover how it works, what the challenges are, and get the inside track on the logistics behind the 2025 F1 season.

We’re not lying when we say logistics is a complex world – and F1 logistics is a never-ending showcase of what complex, international logistics looks like. For every grand prix, hundreds of crates and containers move in parallel: some taking weeks on container ships, others jetting overnight in cargo planes, and more rolling over highways in 18-wheel trucks. The art is choosing the right mode for the right cargo, so that no matter where the race is held, everything is there on time.

Ocean freight

The slowest but most sustainable option, ocean freight carries the bulk of the load: garage structural kits, hospitality suites, fan zones – anything categorized as non-essential to on-track performance. To make it work, teams send five or six identical sets of containers on long rotations, leapfrogging around the globe. For example, sea freight dispatched to China might next appear in Miami, while another set continues from Japan to Singapore and Baku. It’s a global jigsaw that only fits together with meticulous planning.

Air freight

While ocean freight beats at a steady rhythm that keeps the system alive, air freight is the fast pulse that powers each leg of the calendar. Cars, engines, and other race-critical technology – as well as F1’s broadcast equipment – all travel by plane, because they are indispensable on race day and can’t be rotated or left behind. These shipments get absolute priority: the moment the checkered flag falls, critical gear is packed and loaded, often overnight, so that by 10 a.m. on Monday, most air freight has already departed for the next circuit. Without this constant air bridge, there would be no race the following Sunday.

Road freight

Overland transport is the third, vital piece to the puzzle – needed at every race to ferry ocean and air shipments from nearby sea and airports to the track. In Europe, the show moves largely on wheels in trucks, many of which run on biofuels, with freight traveling overland from team factories and regional hubs. Up to 400 trucks hit the road, many with two drivers per cab to keep them moving day and night. Whether they’re snaking their way through mountain passes or shuttling to and from the sea, their arrivals must be timed with precision.

Four crucial considerations guide every move:

Speed – Can the cargo reach its next destination on time?

Volume – Which items can we send by sea to reduce costs and emissions?

Cost – Can we combine modes to keep costs down?

Sustainability – Does our solution help Formula 1 move toward its 2030 Net Zero target?

Every choice carries trade-offs. And with double- and triple-header weekends, customs paperwork, and city-center circuits to contend with, the real challenge isn’t just moving freight – it’s keeping the whole season in motion. Read on to learn more.

Unique local conditions

Some circuits present logistical puzzles all of their own. Each venue requires tailor-made solutions, often in close collaboration with local authorities. Monaco’s streets, for example, are famously tight, leaving no space for convoys to enter the city at once. Instead, trucks must queue in holding bays outside town and are called in one by one, both before and after the race. Although only 500 kilometers separated the Imola Grand Prix from the Monaco Grand Prix, the logistical challenges of entering Monaco ultimately negate any transportation time savings. The Las Vegas Strip Circuit® presents a similar challenge. A special holding yard is created to avoid gridlock as hundreds of trucks deliver equipment in sequence to one of the world’s most iconic boulevards.

Customs complexities

Much of it may be digital nowadays, but the paperwork can still pile up. Every shipment must have precise documentation to clear customs – and sometimes multiple clearances are required before it can enter the country. The complexity and diversity are mindboggling, with fuel shipments clearing easily in one country and requiring special approval in another. In some regions, even the seemingly simple components require special import/export documents that aren’t necessary elsewhere.

External disruptions

Global events can throw even the most detailed plans off course. During the COVID-19 pandemic, three teams were caught in a web of ocean freight delays ahead of the Australian Grand Prix. It took a DHL team of 100 people working around the clock and three dedicated DHL air freighters to ensure all 150 tons of cargo arrived on time. Regional conflicts have also reshaped routes. For example, many sea carriers avoid the Suez Canal – a vital shipping lane near several F1 tracks. Ocean freight for races in the Middle East is rerouted through the port of Jeddah and then trucked to the circuits. Flexibility becomes as critical as speed.

Sustainability

And then there’s the challenge of reducing emissions in a sport that never stands still. Formula 1 has committed to becoming Net Zero by 2030, and DHL is working to help them achieve it – introducing biofueled trucks in Europe, more efficient Boeing 777 aircraft, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for F1’s charter flights. Each step reduces the footprint, but the task remains immense for a race calendar spanning five continents.

Whether it’s navigating customs forms, city-center circuits, or shifting geopolitical landscapes, the world stage keeps every season unpredictable. Yet the mission stays the same: deliver every piece of cargo, on time and in full, so the race can go on.

From Australia to Asia

The season begins in Melbourne, marking the first big logistics test after pre-season testing in Bahrain. With the season’s longest transit times and biggest time zone shift, a global team works around the clock to manage and monitor multiple modes of freight transport. As soon as the checkered flag falls, equipment is packed overnight, and much of it is already in transit to China by Monday morning. Multiple kits are prepared for pre-planned sea shipments to Singapore, Canada, Qatar, and back to Europe.

The first triple header

After China, we move the show to Japan for the first of three triple headers this season – where things get interesting. Air freight from China to Japan is relatively painless, and equipment is shipped by sea in advance from Europe to Bahrain via the port of Jeddah. But there isn’t enough time to truck equipment from Bahrain to Saudi Arabia, so F1’s broadcast items – about 65 tons worth – are leapfrogged from Japan directly by air. Three separate sets of sea freight are also underway to make it all work.

Crossing the globe

Next comes Miami, a major test of multimodal coordination. Sea containers travel from Asia to the U.S. West Coast, then are trucked across the country to Florida in just three days. At the same time, air freight flies in from Saudi Arabia, converging in time for the setup on the Miami waterfront.

The European stretch

Summer in Europe means back-to-back racing and long convoys of trucks. From Imola to Monaco to Barcelona, fleets of up to 400 vehicles move in sequence, often with two drivers per cab to keep them running around the clock. Monaco remains the most delicate operation, with trucks entering one by one into the city’s narrow streets. By the time the paddock reaches Spain, extra crews are drafted in to relieve staff who have been on the road for weeks.

North America and beyond

After Europe, the championship hops over to Canada, where containers arrive by sea from Europe and by road from Miami, while one-kit equipment flies in directly from Barcelona. The Canadian circuit’s island setting on the St. Lawrence River makes space tight, so arrivals and departures are timed with pitstop precision. Later in the year, the calendar shifts to the Americas again, with back-to-back races in Austin and Mexico City – each requiring a different mix of road, air, and sea to overcome customs complexity and border security.

The final push

The closing stretch is as demanding as the start. Brazil, Las Vegas, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi complete the 24-race season. Las Vegas, with its Saturday night race, creates a unique advantage – giving freight just enough time to make the 8,000-mile journey across ten time zones to Qatar by Tuesday morning and ready for the next racing weekend. From there, the season concludes in Abu Dhabi, with sea freight converging from multiple regions for the twilight finale.

By the time the last container is unpacked, preparations for the next season are already under way. With so little downtime, Formula 1 logistics never truly stops – it simply resets for another lap around the globe.",https://www.dhl.com/content/dam/dhl/global/delivered/images/social-share-1200x630/g212-dl-annual-logistics-review2.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 10:57:11.124284

LanzaTech Global Inc. has formalised a new amended version of its agreements with the investors of its subsidiary LanzaJet Inc., which specialises in the production of sustainable aviation fuel. These changes aim to accelerate the commercial rollout of the fuel while adjusting governance and ownership conditions.

The revised agreements introduce a two-tranche share distribution structure, conditional upon achieving development milestones at the Freedom Pines site located in the state of Georgia. If an initial public offering or sale of LanzaJet occurs before LanzaTech receives the full share tranches, its stake will automatically increase to 50% without further financial contribution.

Licence contract extended to 2031

In parallel, the 2020 technology licensing agreement between the two companies has been extended to 31 December 2031. The amendment removes LanzaTech’s right to terminate the contract and imposes an obligation to transfer the licence directly to LanzaJet. It also lifts previous restrictions on sublicensing LanzaJet’s technology to third parties, broadening its commercial application.

This development comes as LanzaJet continues to rely on the Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process, which uses industrial waste converted into ethanol as feedstock. The technology was originally developed by LanzaTech and later improved by LanzaJet.

Strengthened integration strategy

With this restructuring, LanzaTech consolidates its position as the core technology provider while increasing its influence over LanzaJet’s strategic direction. This dual role enables the company to align growth with both technological control and shareholder value creation.

“This new agreement confirms LanzaTech’s role as a strategic shareholder essential to LanzaJet’s development,” said Jennifer Holmgren, Chief Executive Officer of LanzaTech.

The carrier allocated 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) attributes to the flight through a recognized chain-of-custody system without requiring an equivalent physical uplift. The framework relies on the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and on Book & Claim principles. The technical option combines mass balance (accounting allocation within a single infrastructure) and individual certificates for customers. The referenced product is Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) from used cooking oils, backed by internationally recognized certification schemes.

Accounting architecture and control requirements

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recognizes chain-of-custody models compatible with auditable Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV). Mass balance allows fossil and sustainable volumes to be co-processed and attributes to be allocated at the infrastructure outlet while avoiding double counting. Book & Claim decouples the purchase of attributes from uplift, useful at airports without a physical SAF supply chain. Compliance requires retention of allocation evidence, certificate uniqueness, and temporal matching between production, purchase, and claim.

The “50% SAF” claim corresponds to attribute coverage of the flight’s energy needs rather than an identical molecular content in the tank. This approach is designed to create a verifiable demand signal without waiting for high on-site blend availability. Contracts typically include documented traceability, anti-double-counting provisions, and delivery schedules for attributes. Corporate customers integrate these certificates into their Scope 3 Category 6, subject to alignment with their inventory frameworks.

SAF economics and price structure

The unit cost of SAF remains multiple times higher than Jet-A, with a premium driven by supply scarcity, HEFA feedstock costs, and biorefinery capital amortization. Airlines spread the premium through dedicated surcharges, client pricing grids, and certificate programs while limiting exposure via adjustable attribute volumes. Price volatility reflects the gap between rising blending mandates and the cadence of industrial commissioning. Storage, dosing, and certification infrastructure at airports influences the spread between the accounting cost of attributes and the operational cost of a physical uplift.

The announced domestic capacity plan targets premium reduction through feedstock proximity and public incentives. Envisaged feedstocks include used cooking oils and animal fats, with competitive sourcing at urban and regional scale. Bankability rests on staged offtake contracts, performance guarantees, and continuous lot certification. The ramp-up will determine the share of physical uplifts achievable on regional and international routes.

Regional competition and hub positioning

Within the region, Ethiopian Mineral Corp and Sunbird Bioenergy Africa are developing an Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) biofuels complex aiming for blends up to 10% with dedicated agricultural inputs. This trajectory exerts competitive pressure on attracting offtakes and capital, as well as on the ability to supply exportable attributes. Prior cooperation with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines supports technical and documentary standardization, useful for aggregating international corporate demand. The African Airlines Association (AFRAA) facilitates the diffusion of common practices on compliance and quality.

Hub positioning will depend on three factors: pace of securing permits and fiscal incentives, feedstock procurement, and the signing of logistics agreements with key airports. Fueling and storage operators will be central to shifting from a predominantly attribute-based model to a hybrid model with significant uplift. Airlines will seek to minimize operational frictions by harmonizing certification procedures across platforms.

Operational indicators for demand and revenues

The 50% attribute test serves as a measurable proxy for customers seeking verifiable reductions. Book & Claim programs enable monetization of attributes independently of local uplift, creating a distinct and recurring revenue line. Corporate segments with high interregional travel intensity prioritize certificates compatible with their inventories and non-financial reporting. Spreads between attribute pricing and uplift costs guide purchasing tactics, with baskets mixing spot contracts and term commitments.

The most observed contracting policy is modular offtakes indexed to capacity ramp-up and industrial performance milestones. Common clauses cover lot quality, certificate validity, anti-double-counting safeguards, and limited transferability. Airports with dosing and dedicated storage units obtain shorter approval cycles for blends, conditioning expansion to higher physical percentages. The cost trajectory remains sensitive to public decisions on taxes, subsidies, and guarantees.

Kenya Airways’ milestone is a pragmatic demonstration of what transition can look like when driven by domestic initiative rather than external pressure.","By: African sustainability matters

Kenya Airways has operated its first intra-African flight using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a milestone that places the national carrier among the continent’s early adopters of renewable jet fuel technology. The Nairobi–Cape Town flight, completed under the SkyTeam Aviation Challenge 2025, used a 50 per cent blend of SAF attributes verified through global certification schemes. It marks a significant move by the airline to reduce its carbon footprint and aligns with international efforts to achieve net zero emissions in aviation by 2050.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is derived from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and captured carbon combined with green hydrogen. When produced through Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, it can reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 85 per cent compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel.

The flight, operated under a mass balance system, represents not only a technical demonstration but a signal that Africa’s aviation industry is beginning to confront its share of the global climate challenge.

According to industry analysts, aviation accounts for around 2.5 per cent of global carbon emissions but remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects that Sustainable Aviation Fuel will deliver up to 65 per cent of the total emissions reduction needed for the industry to reach net zero by mid-century. Kenya Airways’ experiment is therefore less about symbolism and more about testing feasibility within the constraints of African energy markets and infrastructure.

The flight carried a blend of optimism and pragmatism. Kenya Airways said the SAF attributes were verified under globally recognized certification frameworks to ensure traceability and transparency.

Onboard, the airline introduced a series of low-waste initiatives, including upcycled blanket bags, reusable cutlery, and locally sourced Kenyan coffee and tea served in reusable cups. Cabin crew also engaged passengers in discussions on responsible travel practices, an approach that turns sustainability from a back-office metric into a visible in-flight experience.

Hellen Mwariri, Kenya Airways’ Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer, described the initiative as evidence of what can be achieved when innovation is paired with collaboration. “This flight shows what can be achieved through partnership and creativity,” she said. “It’s a step towards practical solutions that reduce our impact while keeping operations efficient.”

Behind this optimism lies a set of economic and policy questions. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is still prohibitively expensive, costing between two and four times more than conventional jet fuel. In an industry already constrained by thin profit margins and high operational costs, this price gap poses a serious challenge to adoption.

Analysts note that while airlines in Europe and North America benefit from government incentives and clear blending mandates, African carriers face fragmented policy environments, limited refining capacity and weak investment pipelines for renewable fuel production.

Kenya Airways’ move could, however, catalyze regional interest in domestic production. The airline has confirmed ongoing work with government agencies, local innovators and international partners, including IATA, SkyTeam and the African Airlines Association (AFRAA), to establish a local SAF production plant in Kenya by 2026. If successful, such a facility would position Kenya as an East African hub for low-carbon aviation fuel and potentially lower costs through local supply chains.

The global race toward SAF production capacity underscores this ambition. By 2024, the United States and the European Union had jointly accounted for nearly 90 per cent of global SAF output, thanks to a combination of blending mandates and fiscal incentives. Africa, despite being rich in bio-feedstock such as jatropha, camelina and waste oils, contributes less than 1 per cent.

Establishing local production in Kenya could therefore have multiplier effects: stimulating green manufacturing, supporting circular economy models through waste valorization, and reducing dependence on imported petroleum products that strain foreign exchange reserves.

From a sustainability standpoint, the broader challenge lies in scalability. Even at 50 per cent blending, a full network transition would require millions of litres annually. Kenya Airways alone consumed about 700 million litres of jet fuel before the pandemic, meaning that sustained decarbonisation will depend on both fuel availability and supportive regulation. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which mandates airlines to offset emissions on international routes, provides a framework but relies heavily on the development of alternative fuels to meet its long-term goals.

The symbolic value of Kenya Airways’ flight extends beyond corporate sustainability. It demonstrates how African airlines can use sustainability as a competitive asset, attracting environmentally conscious travellers and international partners. It also aligns with Kenya’s national climate agenda, which targets a 32 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 and a long-term goal of net zero by 2050. In a continent where aviation supports millions of jobs, from tourism and horticulture to logistics, decarbonizing flight operations is both an environmental and economic imperative.

Kenya Airways flies first African route, from Nairobi to Cape Town, on sustainable fuel

Practical sustainability will depend on continued collaboration between airlines, refineries, policymakers and financiers. Experts argue that regional alliances, such as between Kenya Airways, Ethiopian Airlines and South African Airways, could generate economies of scale to justify local refining and research investment.

Beyond environmental benefits, the emergence of a regional SAF supply chain could anchor new industries in waste processing, biofuel refining and logistics sectors with clear employment potential.

Kenya Airways’ milestone is a pragmatic demonstration of what transition can look like when driven by domestic initiative rather than external pressure. The flight does not resolve the cost problem, nor does it eliminate emissions overnight. But it offers a credible test case, one that moves the conversation from ambition to practice, and from pledges to proof.",https://orepulse.com/storage/uploads/CwzE9OwiTsxzSjhEkdosySRhLcxk3w7lsmLPqpAT.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 07:56:10.711958

For the Middle East, the outlook reinforces a continuing role as a bridge in global aviation.","Airbus’s 2025 Global Market Forecast (GMF) points to a new phase in aviation development, defined by the transformation of the global fleet. Over the next two decades, the world’s commercial aircraft fleet is expected to expand from 24,730 aircraft in 2024 to 49,210 in 2044, nearly doubling. Yet this expansion is driven as much by replacement as by growth.

According to Airbus, airlines will require 43,420 new aircraft deliveries between now and 2044. Of these, around 44% will replace older aircraft that are less fuel-efficient and more expensive to operate. The manufacturer estimates that 18,900 aircraft will retire during this period. This balance marks a structural shift in the economics of fleet management: renewal has become as important as expansion.

A mature cycle of growth

Passenger traffic is forecast to rise by 3.6% annually through 2044, and air cargo by 3.3%. These figures represent a stabilised, long-term trajectory for the industry, suggesting sustained global demand without the volatility of previous decades.

The drivers behind this steady growth remain familiar. Airbus expects world GDP to grow by 2.5% a year, global trade to grow by 2.6%, and the middle-class population to increase by 1.5 billion people. Together, these trends underpin both passenger mobility and trade flows.

But what is changing is how airlines plan to serve this demand. Fleet replacement cycles are accelerating as operators pursue lower unit costs and compliance with new environmental standards. The emphasis is shifting from capacity expansion to efficiency and asset utilisation.

Freighter modernisation

The cargo segment illustrates this transformation clearly. Airbus forecasts a 45% increase in the dedicated freighter fleet by 2044, bringing the total to 3,420 aircraft worldwide. The composition of that growth, however, signals a different kind of expansion. Of the 2,605 additional freighters expected to enter service, 1,670 will be passenger-to-freighter conversions (P2F), while 935 will be new-build aircraft such as the A350F, A330P2F, and A321P2F.

The predominance of conversions indicates a pragmatic approach to growth. By extending the operational life of passenger aircraft, airlines and lessors can expand cargo capacity while limiting capital expenditure and manufacturing emissions.

Airbus projects that Asia-Pacific and North America will together account for almost two-thirds of total freighter demand—about 850 and 920 aircraft, respectively— but much of that capacity will transit through or connect with Middle Eastern hubs.

The Middle East’s strategic position

The GMF highlights the Middle East as a pivotal region in the evolving air-cargo map. Traffic between Asia and the Middle East is expected to grow at 5.3% per year, while intra-Middle East traffic will increase by 5.2%, among the fastest-rising corridors globally.

This projection reinforces the region’s established role as a logistics and connectivity hub. Carriers such as Emirates SkyCargo, Qatar Airways Cargo, Etihad Cargo, and Saudia Cargo already operate some of the youngest and most efficient fleets in the world. Their strategies combine new-build freighter acquisitions with conversion programmes and digital modernisation.

As trade patterns diversify, with manufacturing growth in economies such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and Brazil, the Gulf’s location between Asia, Europe, and Africa will continue to provide a competitive advantage. Airbus’s outlook suggests that the Middle East will not only remain a transit centre but also evolve as a regional base for fleet renewal and conversion activities, supported by local MRO capabilities and SAF infrastructure.

Efficiency as the organising principle

Airbus positions fleet modernisation as the most effective short-term pathway to reducing emissions. The company estimates that replacing older aircraft with newer models can reduce fuel burn per seat-kilometre by up to 25%. Since 1990, the industry has reduced fuel consumption per passenger-kilometre by 54%, mainly through advances in aerodynamics, materials, and propulsion.

All Airbus aircraft currently in production can operate with a 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blend, to reach 100% SAF capability by 2030. New-generation models, such as the A220, A320neo, A330neo, A350, and A350F, offer between 20% and 40% lower fuel burn than the aircraft they replace.

This improvement in operational efficiency is the main reason why renewal now outweighs expansion. For airlines, newer aircraft reduce fuel and maintenance costs, extend range, and improve carbon-intensity metrics, which are increasingly tied to investor and regulatory scrutiny.

Technology and investment

The GMF also links fleet transformation to sustained investment in innovation. Airbus reports €2.7 billion in research and development spending in 2024, focused mainly on propulsion and aerodynamic efficiency, digital operations, and lifecycle sustainability.

Longer-term projects include the ZEROe hydrogen propulsion demonstrator, which explores hydrogen fuel cells as a future energy source, and hybrid-electric propulsion, aimed at achieving a further 5% fuel saving compared to standard configurations.

At the end of the aircraft lifecycle, Airbus’s Life Cycle Services facility in China has achieved a 91% recycling rate during dismantling, evidence of growing attention to material recovery and circularity within the industry.

The financial logic of sustainability

The GMF frames sustainability not as a separate agenda but as an economic imperative. Fuel efficiency directly influences airline profitability, and regulatory costs related to carbon emissions are expected to rise steadily. In this context, the transition to newer aircraft is both an environmental and financial strategy.

For aircraft manufacturers, this translates into a long-term replacement market. For airlines, it provides measurable reductions in operating cost and exposure to fuel-price volatility. For investors and lessors, it enhances asset value by improving residual performance and conversion potential.

Airbus estimates that 34% of the global in-service fleet already consists of the latest-generation aircraft. The priority for the coming decade is to replace the remaining two-thirds. This process represents the sector’s most immediate opportunity for emissions reduction.

A balanced outlook

The 2025 GMF also reflects a more disciplined optimism than earlier forecasts. The industry’s projected growth is significant but not speculative. It incorporates disruptions such as trade tariffs, energy-price volatility, and policy transitions.

The underlying assumption is that global air transport demand will continue to align with moderate GDP and trade expansion, supported by population growth and urbanisation.

For airlines, the challenge will be maintaining profitability amid heavy capital investment. The shift toward more sustainable fleets requires substantial funding and infrastructure adaptation, particularly in SAF supply and distribution. However, the GMF implies that these investments are economically justified by the operational savings they deliver.

Implications for the Middle East

For Middle Eastern aviation, Airbus’s projections confirm a long-term advantage rooted in geography and strategy. Regional carriers are already aligned with the forecast’s two main trends: fleet modernisation and cargo diversification. The region’s airports and logistics networks are positioned to capture increased flows between emerging manufacturing centres in Asia and consumer markets in Europe and Africa.

As national aviation strategies under Saudi Vision 2030 and the UAE’s long-term transport frameworks emphasise logistics, sustainability, and connectivity, Airbus’s outlook provides data-based support for these priorities. The transition to newer, more efficient fleets is not only environmentally necessary but also commercially sound. For the Middle East, the outlook reinforces a continuing role as a bridge in global aviation. Geographically central, commercially active, and strategically positioned to lead in both fleet renewal and cargo modernisation. The following two decades will not be about recovering lost ground but about rebuilding the foundations of aviation efficiency. Airbus’ forecast confirms that growth will continue, but it will be measured more in terms of performance than volume.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/10/27/airbus_a380_on_the_ground-1.png,N,,2025-10-27 05:56:33.955953

The introduction of ‘Established on RNP (EoR)’ as the concept is widely referred to enabling aircraft landing at Stockholm Arlanda to fly with curved approaches to a greater extent than before.

The new approach concept allows the airport to increase the landing rate per hour and reduce emissions, both for aircraft flying the shorter, curved approach and for those flying the standard instrument landing approach. This is because fewer aircraft have to use the runway dedicated for arrivals, therefore reducing queues.

“The modernisation of the airspace by Luftfartsverket shows how air traffic control can help reduce the environmental impact of aviation,” said Anna Granberg, Director of Operations at Luftfartsverket. She explained that with the new approach traffic flow into Arlanda will be more efficient during peak hours, while arriving aircraft have shorter flight paths with reduced emissions.

“We are very pleased with the initiative from Swedavia and the Swedish Air Traffic Control Provider (LFV) to implement new procedures that will increase the number of curved approaches ((RNP AR- Required Navigation Performance, Authorization Required) at Arlanda,” noted Charlotte Holmbergh, Country Director Corporate Affairs at Norwegian.

She added that shorter approaches result in lower fuel burn and lower emissions. “Our goal is to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030 and more efficient flight operations like this are among our top priorities,” she said. Holmbergh also noted that the wider adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and continuous fleet renewal are also integral to the airline’s decarbonisation goals.

SAS’s Head of External Communication, Alexandra Lindgren Kaoukji, also welcomed Arlanda’s new approach concept.

“SAS welcomes all initiatives that help reduce fuel consumption, noise and emissions.

According to regulatory data, the sustainable fuel market has witnessed rapid growth, rising from $175.41 billion in 2024 to $196.04 billion in 2025, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.8 percent. Experts attribute this expansion to accelerated industrialization, growing urbanization, the global shift toward renewable energy, increasing demand for biofuels, and rising overall energy consumption.

Analysts forecast that the sector will maintain strong momentum, growing at a 12.3 percent CAGR in the coming years. This growth, they say, is being driven by environmental concerns linked to fossil fuels, rising transportation fuel demand, the global focus on cutting carbon emissions, and the growth of electric vehicles, supported by favorable government policies and regulations.

Emerging trends expected to shape the future of the industry include carbon capture technologies, improved eco-friendly fuel sourcing methods, next-generation biofuels, hydrogen-based fuels, and waste-to-fuel innovations.

In Nigeria, efforts are underway to align with this global shift. Managing Director of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Olubunmi Kuku, emphasized the need for collaboration among aviation stakeholders to reduce logistics costs and improve nationwide fuel supply.

Kuku said FAAN is upgrading infrastructure to enhance efficiency in the supply chain.

She stated, “Setting up more fuel farms across airports will make logistics easier, cut costs, and improve air connectivity across the country.”

She also reaffirmed FAAN’s commitment to maintaining safety standards through its Quality Assurance framework, which ensures international best practices in fuel storage, handling, and delivery. Kuku added that the authority plans to expand airside access, upgrade storage facilities, and support innovation in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through partnerships with private marketers.

“FAAN is ready to play its part in building a stronger, cleaner, and more resilient aviation fuel ecosystem in Nigeria,” she said.

Meanwhile, Engr. Peter Dia, General Manager of Operations at Octavus Petroleum Limited, expressed concern over the shortage of skilled technical personnel in the aviation fueling sector. He urged regulators in both the aviation and petroleum industries to ensure that operators possess adequate technical expertise.

“There are marketers in this business today who shouldn’t be here,” Dia remarked, pointing out that Nigeria lacks a local standard for jet fuel. He explained that while Nigeria’s crude oil is suitable for aviation fuel, jet fuel (Jet A1) must go through the proper refining and certification processes before it is safe for use.

He further noted that the aviation fuel business is capital-intensive, citing that a new 45,000-liter Bowser costs around ₦1 billion, and stressed the importance of regulatory checks on the financial stability of fuel marketers.

Dia also criticized the lack of fueling infrastructure planning in many Nigerian airports. “Airports are being designed without involving fuel marketers, which is why some new terminals don’t have fuel hydrants,” he said.

Martin Abhulimen, Regional Manager for Lagos and West Africa at Ibom Air, called on aviation fuel marketers to work more closely with airlines to negotiate better jet fuel prices.

He noted that the sharp increase in jet fuel prices between 2023 and 2024 severely affected airline operations, with carriers unable to pass on the cost to passengers. While fuel hedging is common in other countries, Abhulimen said the volatile Nigerian market makes such strategies impractical.

He urged airlines to form joint negotiating platforms to secure fairer fuel prices and emphasized that poor infrastructure, particularly at secondary airports, continues to be a major obstacle for local carriers.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-10.png,N,,2025-10-27 04:56:32.190939

Jet A1 market to grow through 2030-Ex-FAAN MD

The Group Managing Director of CITA Energies, Dr Thomas Ogungbangbe, has echoed the frustration of aviation fuel marketers, stressing that despite the expectations, the reality experienced by aviation fuel marketers since Dangote’s refinery commission has been far more complex and constrained.

According to him, dependence on imports continues as 40% of Jet-A1 is still, saying that although production has begun, a steady domestic supply of aviation-grade Jet A-1 has been slower than expected.

Speaking at a colloquium at the weekend with the theme, “Aviation Fuel Business in Nigeria – The Scenario and the Metaphor, Ogungbangbe said that while the refinery has the installed capacity to produce aviation fuel, the practical rollout of refined Jet A-1 into the domestic market has been slower and more restrictive than anticipated.

On the current reality, he disclosed that Jet A-1 from the Dangote Refinery is not yet cheaper than imported alternatives, noting that the refinery sells in U.S. dollars, aligning prices with global benchmarks.

He hinted that the expected cost relief for airlines and marketers has not materialised, with airlines continuing to face high operational costs.

He further lamented that marketers have limited direct access to jet fuel supply, with distribution still structured through controlled offtake agreements.

The broader market implication, according to him, is that independent and smaller aviation marketers remain dependent on intermediaries or imports.

As Foreign Exchange exposure persists, he said, because the refinery prices are in US dollars, aviation fuel marketers must still source foreign exchange, defeating the earlier expectation of Naira-based transactions, alleging that airlines and marketers still rely partly on imported products to bridge shortfalls.

His words, “Uncertainty in pricing and market operations discourages long-term planning. As the refinery seeks to recoup its investment, it maintains export-oriented pricing, limiting domestic price advantage. Local consumers, including aviation, are yet to feel the economic relief anticipated.”

Speaking further of the quality of aviation fuel in the country, the CITA chief expressed grave concerns about the mislabeling of kerosene as Jet A1.

He lamented that the situation poses serious risks, including engine failure, thermal instability, and contamination, pointing out that enforcing certification and traceability protocols at every supply chain stage is vital to prevent such occurrences.

The rise of modular refineries, he further stated, presents challenges in consistently meeting DEF STAN 91-91 and ASTM D1655 standards, saying success depends on thorough quality control, third-party certification, and alignment with global testing protocols.

“While major marketers such as TotalEnergies, MRS, and CITA Energies maintain ISO-certified QA systems, traceability is fragmented due to manual processes. A digital platform linking refineries, depots, and airlines would enhance real-time visibility and accountability. Establishing Joint Quality Audit Committees with representatives from refineries, marketers, NCAA, and airlines is critical for regular quality reviews and ensuring industry-wide standards.”

He, however, disclosed that Nigeria offers some of the lowest Jet A1 prices in West Africa, influenced largely by Dangote Refinery’s impact and local supply efficiencies rather than competitive market forces alone.

“Although claims of marketer collusion are anecdotal, oligopolistic behaviour exists due to high barriers to entry. Expanding refining capacity and encouraging new market entrants can foster competition. A public pricing template detailing cost components such as crude, refining, logistics, forex rate, and margins would build trust between airlines and marketers.”

Ogungbangbe stated that the evolution of aviation fuel in Nigeria mirrors the nation’s own journey — from dependency to determination, from challenges to change, saying that the advent of indigenous refineries may redefine the supply chain, but noted that it is, “Our collective vision, collaboration, and integrity that will define the future.”

Air transport specialist and a former Managing Director of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Dr Richard Aisuebeogun, posited that passenger traffic in Nigeria continues to rise, driven by connectivity, tourism, infrastructure investment, and economic diversification.

He stated that the Jet A-1 market is projected to grow steadily through 2030, underpinned by domestic refining, infrastructure reforms, and regulatory consistency.

To secure the future of Nigeria’s aviation fueling industry, Aisuebeogun said the country must pursue three key pathways, such as investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and renewable energy innovations, strengthening standards, enforcement, audits and encouragement of joint ventures, shared infrastructure, and bulk procurement for stability and fair competition.

The thirtieth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP30) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is scheduled to take place from November 10-21 in Belem, Brazil.

This pivotal international summit will gather world leaders, policymakers, scientists, and civil society representatives to address the pressing global challenge of climate change.

COP30 theme

A key objective of COP30 will be for participating nations to present updated National Climate Commitments, often referred to as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

These NDCs outline each country’s plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change, reflecting their highest possible ambition.

The summit will provide a crucial platform for countries to demonstrate their progress since previous conferences and to commit to more ambitious targets in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement, particularly the aim of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, above pre-industrial levels.

Furthermore, COP30 will involve a comprehensive assessment of the progress made on renewable energy targets that were established at prior summits.

This includes evaluating the deployment of renewable energy technologies, the development of supportive policies, and the mobilisation of financing for a global transition away from fossil fuels.

Biofuel pledge

La Camera expects a biofuel pledge to be included in the final declaration, possibly as a target to quadruple production by 2035 or to establish a specific share for sustainable aviation fuel within the overall energy mix, according to a Reuters report.

“I think there will be more focus on the social aspect of the transition and also on the sustainable use of biomass,” La Camera was quoted in the report as saying on the sidelines of the Singapore International Energy Week event.

IRENA has launched an agreement with the International Civil Aviation Organization to promote biofuel manufacturing. This initiative follows the preparation of a biofuel report by the agency for the conference.

La Camera announced that the upcoming conference would be dedicated to exploring and facilitating community involvement in renewable energy initiatives.

The focus will be on developing strategies and frameworks that empower local communities to actively participate in the planning, development, and implementation of sustainable energy projects.

La Camera further announced that IRENA now anticipates a reduced deficit in renewable energy installations by 2030, attributing this to the quicker rate of new additions.

The projected shortfall for global renewable capacity by 2030, in relation to the COP28 target of 11.2 terawatts, has decreased to 0.9 terawatts. This marks an improvement over last year’s projection of a 1.49 terawatt shortfall.

At the 2023 COP28 climate summit in Dubai, over 100 nations committed to tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 to help achieve global climate goals.

According to a recent IRENA report, meeting this 2030 target necessitates an annual growth rate of 16.6% from 2025 onwards.

The size of the sustainable fuel market, according to regulatory data has experienced rapid expansion in the recent past. It escalated from $175.41 billion in 2024 to $196.04 billion in 2025, it will exhibit a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.8 percent. The robust expansion during the past years , experts say has been driven by many considerations.

They listed fast-paced industrialization and urbanization, a swift transition to renewable energy sources, a steep rise in the biofuel demand, and dominant energy demand are among factors driving the growth of the space.

The market size for sustainable fuel is predicted to undergo swift expansion in the coming years, with projections of attaining a 12.3 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR).

The expansion during this forecast period , experts say is largely due to rising environmental worries linked to traditional fuels, surging demand in the transportation sector, an increasing realization of the pressing need to curb carbon emissions, growth in production of electric vehicles, and supportive laws and regulations.

Key trends in the forecast period, experts have identified , comprise carbon capture technologies, advancements in environmentally-friendly sourcing methods, next-generation biofuels, developments in hydrogen-based fuels, and the emergence of waste-to-fuel technologies.

Speaking in an interview, Managing Director of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Mr Olubunmi Kuku canvassed collaboration among players in the ecosystem in order to

reduce logistics costs and improve fuel availability nationwide.

She said the authority is improving infrastructure to drive efficiency in the supply chain to boost operations.

Kuku said : “More fuel farms across our airports will ease logistics, reduce costs, and enhance nationwide connectivity.”

Highlighting the agency’s safety commitment, Kuku assured stakeholders that FAAN’s Quality Assurance framework would continue to uphold global standards in fuel storage, handling, and delivery.

In addition, FAAN she said plans to expand enabling infrastructure, from airside access to modern storage facilities, while encouraging innovation, particularly in exploring Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through partnerships with forward-thinking marketers.

“In essence, “FAAN stands ready to be an enabler, facilitator, and partner in ensuring that Nigeria’s aviation fuel ecosystem becomes stronger, cleaner, and more resilient.”

Also speaking, General Manager, Operations, Octavus Petroleum Limited, Engr. Peter Dia has raised concerns on the quality of technical personnel in aviation fuelling space.

He stressed the need for regulators of aviation fuel business in both aviation and petroleum sectors to have adequate knowledge on what should be done to ensure products quality and safety assurance.

“There are fuel marketers today who have no business being in this business,” he said, stating that there is no local standard for jet fuel.

“Our crude oil in Nigeria is the right crude but kerosene is only called Jet A1 after it has gone through the right processes to be called Jet A1. It has to be given a refinery certificate of quality even if it comes from a refinery,” he said.

Dia however, note that jet fuel marketing business is expensive and requires serious minded people. He said one brand new 45 litre capacity Bowser costs about N1 billion and that there are filters in Bowsers that eliminate water from the fuel and make them safe for aircraft.

He recommended that the financial health of aviation fuel marketers should be checked by regulators.

He also frowned at the absence of fuelling infrastructure at the planning stage of airports that were established and the failure to involve aviation fuel stakeholders.

“The airports in Nigeria are being planned without fuel marketers’ involvement. That is why we have new terminals today without fuel hydrants,” he said.

Also speaking, Regional Manager, Lagos & West Africa, Ibom Air Limited, Mr. Martin Abhulimen called on aviation fuel marketers in Nigeria to help the local airlines by championing their collaborative negotiations of jet fuel prices.

He noted that jet fuel price hike that occurred between 2023 and 2024 significantly affected airline business and that impact of the occurrence could not be passed on to air travelers.

He said fuel hedging would have been an option as is done in other climes but that because of volatility of the environment, hedging does not work in Nigeria.

He therefore recommended collaboration of airlines in their negotiation with jet fuel marketers so as to get more favourable price bargain.

He noted that infrastructure had posed a bigger challenge to airlines at secondary airports in Nigeria.",https://cdn.thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/23210606/aviation-fuel.png,N,,2025-10-27 03:56:43.806293

KOTA KINABALU: More than 2,000 kilogrammes of used cooking oil (UCO) were successfully collected through the Used Cooking Oil Collection Competition involving 13 schools across Kota Kinabalu.

The competition was part of the Ministry of Plantation and Commodities’ (KPK) efforts to foster civic awareness and sustainable practices among students regarding the proper management of used cooking oil and its potential as a raw material for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

At the closing ceremony held at Horizon Hotel, Kota Kinabalu, Deputy Minister of Plantation and Commodities, Datuk Chan Foong Hin, presented prizes to the winning schools.

In the primary school category, SJKC Chung Hwa Likas emerged champion with a collection of 420 kilogrammes, followed by SK St. Francis Convent as first runner-up with 192 kilogrammes, and SK Kepayan in third place with 170.85 kilogrammes. For the secondary school category, SMK SANZAC claimed the top spot with 392.5 kilogrammes, while SM Tshung Tsin and SMJK Shan Tao shared the runner-up position with 113.5 kilogrammes each.

The achievement reflects a high level of environmental awareness among students and school communities regarding the importance of managing used cooking oil responsibly. Active participation from students, teachers and parents played a crucial role in the programme’s success.

In his speech, Chan expressed his appreciation to all participating schools, as well as the key implementing partners — Kota Kinabalu City Hall (DBKK) and JCI Kota Kinabalu, for their commitment and collaboration in making the inaugural initiative a success in Sabah.

“The success of collecting over 2,000 kilogrammes of used cooking oil in just two months proves that environmental education and awareness at the school level can have a major impact on the community. This is not merely a recycling activity but a shared commitment to supporting the nation’s transition towards sustainable energy,” he said.

He added that used cooking oil now holds growing economic value, particularly as a key feedstock for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), in line with the National Agri-Commodity Policy 2030 (DAKN2030) which emphasises the development of high value-added and low-carbon agri-commodities.

According to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB), total UCO collection in Sabah in 2024 was around 5,200 tonnes — less than 1.5 per cent of Malaysia’s overall total of 380,000 tonnes during the same period. Initiatives such as this competition are therefore expected to serve as catalysts for increasing UCO collection rates in Sabah.

Chan also called on more stakeholders, including other schools, non-governmental organisations and local communities, to take part in the initiative for better UCO management. He said this effort not only generates additional income for households but also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution.

“Interested schools may contact my office for coordination with DBKK and licensed UCO collection vendors such as Arus Oil to ensure proper and safe collection processes. Programmes like this prove that small actions at the community level can make a big difference to the nation’s sustainable energy future. Let us strengthen the culture of recycling for the well-being of the people and the sustainability of our planet,” he added.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d65831_acbd0eb45f2040de9d7aaed32790048e~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1080,h_720,al_c/d65831_acbd0eb45f2040de9d7aaed32790048e~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-10-27 03:56:48.711773

“Most of the work so far has been on bio-based sustainable aviation fuel projects,” he said.
If successful, the project could help realise Australian ambitions to become a green fuel exporter, he said.

Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is typically made from agricultural waste such as sugarcane, tallow, canola and cooking oils and can reduce emissions from aircraft by 80 per cent compared to traditional jet fuel.

But the UNSW project deploys an electrolyser that uses low-cost metals, carbon catalysts and renewable energy to turn carbon dioxide and water into fuel precursors.

The approach could cut out the need for farm waste and make environmentally friendly fuel easier to produce at scale, project leader Rahman Daiyan said.

“Most of the work so far has been on bio-based sustainable aviation fuel projects,” he said.

“But those sort of biomass resources are limited to some extent.”

The Trailblazer for Recycling and Clean Energy program, established by the Federal Education Department, has awarded the UNSW research team an additional $1.2 million to scale up its technology.

While the electrolyser has been proven to work in a lab, Dr Daiyan said a validated prototype would be ready within six to nine months and the project would be commercialised with industry partners Tjindu Power and Chinese energy firm Chuangqi Times.

If successful, the project could help realise Australian ambitions to become a green fuel exporter, he said.

“One of the best aspects of this technology is that it allows us to leverage Australia’s potential — we want to be a hydrogen exporter or a low-carbon fuel exporter,” Dr Daiyan said.

“There is domestic demand but there is also overseas demand because apart from Singapore and Malaysia, there are not a lot of places to make SAF for the Asia Pacific region.”

Sustainable aviation fuel is considered to be one of the leading ways to reduce carbon emission from air travel and is in high demand worldwide after major airlines committed to using the fuel to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

A report by the CSIRO and aircraft maker Boeing, released last year, found Australia could lead the world in production of the sustainable fuel but warned it had made only moderate progress so far.

A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We have been clear that airport expansion will only go ahead if it aligns with our legal obligations on climate change, including net zero.""","The Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) said government support for airport growth poses serious risks to meeting the legally binding target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.

In a new report, the committee said that relying on emerging technologies like sustainable aviation fuel is not enough to ensure the aviation sector meets its carbon reduction goals.

Toby Perkins, chairman of the EAC, said: ""The aviation industry is critically important to the UK, but it’s also one of the hardest sectors of our economy to decarbonise.

""Meeting our decarbonisation targets is already a major challenge. Expanding airport capacity is likely to make that task much harder.""

He warned: ""Under the government’s existing Jet Zero Strategy, expanding airport capacity is likely to put net zero at serious risk, unless it is accompanied by a serious strategic approach to increasing the pace of decarbonising aviation.""

The committee also said the government has not provided evidence that the economic benefits of airport expansion outweigh the environmental and climate costs.

Recent approvals and ongoing projects at major airports include plans for a third runway at Heathrow, routine use of a second runway at Gatwick, and capacity increases at Manchester, Stansted and Luton.

In April, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander approved plans to nearly double capacity at Luton Airport, including a terminal extension and a new terminal.

The EAC said these decisions appear to be moving forward without updated economic analysis or a revised Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS), which dates back to 2018.

The committee called on the Government to demonstrate how it will meet its climate and nature targets if it continues to support large-scale airport expansion.

The ruling, which focused on TotalEnergies’ statements about its carbon neutrality ambitions, ordered the company’s French affiliate to remove three paragraphs from its customer-facing website. The court found that the removed content failed to reference the internal energy transition scenario underpinning TotalEnergies’ multi-energy strategy.

However, the court rejected key allegations concerning TotalEnergies’ 2021 rebranding campaign and broader communications about the role of natural gas and biofuels in the energy transition—both central themes in the company’s strategy. No advertising by TotalEnergies or its affiliates was condemned, contrary to some earlier media reports.

TotalEnergies said it will not appeal the ruling, adding that it plans to replace the removed paragraphs with factual updates highlighting its progress in implementing its multi-energy strategy. The company reiterated its view that the decision confirms the overall integrity of its public communications.

The French energy major also used the occasion to spotlight its domestic and global investments in low-carbon energy. Since 2020, TotalEnergies has invested more than €20 billion worldwide—including €4 billion in France—across renewables, biofuels, electricity, and EV charging. It now operates 32 GW of gross installed renewable capacity and produces 50 TWh of electricity annually, equivalent to about fifteen nuclear reactors.

In France, the company has built a 2 GW renewables portfolio spanning 430 wind and solar projects, serves 4.2 million electricity and gas customers, and leads the motorway EV charging market with nearly 1,900 fast chargers. It has also invested close to €1 billion in two biorefineries producing biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel, while developing 117 agrivoltaic projects totaling almost 2 GW.

Globally, TotalEnergies said it has reduced greenhouse gas emissions from its operated oil and gas facilities by 36% since 2015 and cut methane emissions by 55% since 2020.

The court’s decision comes amid mounting scrutiny of oil and gas companies’ climate claims in Europe, where regulators and environmental groups have targeted corporate “greenwashing” in advertising and investor communications. In recent years, TotalEnergies and its peers have faced lawsuits seeking to challenge the credibility of their net-zero and transition strategies.

Despite ongoing criticism, TotalEnergies defended its record, emphasizing that it continues to balance energy security, affordability, and decarbonization goals. “Regardless of those who accuse us of greenwashing, we are proud to make every effort to serve our customers every day and to help build the energy system of tomorrow,” the company stated.

”It’s not just students; the competition is open to researchers across the world.” Undavalli, Hamilton and Wei said they sought to create more sustainable testing methods for aviation fuels.
“I’m using a new method where I take some samples of the fuel outside to measure what’s happening inside.

They said the global recognition they received has validated their hard work and is motivating them to pursue their goals even further.","Three UA engineering students were recognized for their groundbreaking research on sustainable aviation fuel and development of innovative experimental setups for emerging fuel adoption.

Vamsi Krishna Undavalli, Jerry Hamilton and Chuming Wei, all doctoral students studying mechanical engineering, earned second prize of the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Aviation Award and received a total of $150,000 from the $1 million prize pool for all nine winners.

The International Civil Aviation Organization and the General Civil Aviation Authority of the United Arab Emirates collaborate to organize this award open to states, organizations and individuals, with the goal of “recognizing their contribution to the success of the aviation industry.”

“This is a rigorous selection that happens with the jury committee and the technical evaluation committee,” Undavalli said. ”It’s not just students; the competition is open to researchers across the world.”

Undavalli, Hamilton and Wei said they sought to create more sustainable testing methods for aviation fuels. Hamilton focused on testing for fuel compatibility with different mechanical portions of the engine, Wei studied how emerging fuels performed under thermal stress, and Undavalli focused on the emissions and how to reduce them.

“A company who is developing fuels has all the different solutions they made, but they don’t have the money to invest in every single one,” Hamilton said. “This kind of pipeline and this kind of testing allows them to do a more inexpensive initial testing to choose which would be the best pathway to go.”

Hamilton said that Wei’s “very delicate heating and measuring process” for thermal stability tests was one of the most significant challenges of the research.

“My test is a little bit different than theirs because some data they cannot measure,” Wei said. “I’m using a new method where I take some samples of the fuel outside to measure what’s happening inside. No one has done that before.”

Another challenge the group said they faced was replicating the conditions of a real aircraft at a much smaller scale. They started with combustion test rigs for lab testing.

“Now we are venturing into a high-altitude emission test bench where we are trying to replicate what would happen at 40,000 feet,” Undavalli said.

Hamilton’s 20 years of past experience flying helicopters for the military contributed to the researchers’ real-world perspective.

“We were looking for ways throughout this whole process to inject a more realistic testing of what would actually happen from the time the fuel enters the tank, until it’s combusted, until the products are actually in the atmosphere,” Hamilton said.

The researchers said they believe that their tests could be the standard for the aviation industry and that they hope to see their research applied to real-world performances of aviation fuels.

“We created what maybe could be a preliminary benchmark before doing certification processes where much of the large fuel producers can come and avail this research and the test protocols, and eventually use this to better refine their fuel chemistry,” Undavalli said.

They said the global recognition they received has validated their hard work and is motivating them to pursue their goals even further.

“I spent a lot of time to design my experiment, and it always has a lot of problems and improvements that sometimes drive me crazy,” Wei said. “This award has really encouraged me for what I’ve been doing so far, and it’s really helped me to move further.”",https://thecrimsonwhite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot_26-10-2025_22851_snoflow.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com_.jpeg,N,,2025-10-26 23:56:10.538739

The revelation has led to Nationals Senator Matt Canavan warning plane travel will be only for the “very, very rich” in the future.

The airline industry has been working toward streamlining passenger check-ins and comfortable cabins, but major changes are also on the horizon for the cost of air travel.

Last week, the International Air Transport Association’s world sustainability symposium in Hong Kong heard travellers could pay an extra $1,350 on average for a plane ticket by 2050.

This equates to an approximate ticket increase of $54 year on year.

The hike is based on the need for 7000 sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plants across the world to produce the required levels for airlines, which is estimated to cost $7.23 trillion, or $268 billion per year.

At the moment, only about two million metric tonnes of SAF are being produced annually - a fraction of the almost 500 million tonnes needed by 2050, according to The Australian.

Mr Canavan highlighted the $1,350 jump in prices over the next two decades in a post on X.

“Under net zero plane travel would be reserved for the very, very rich,” Mr Canavan wrote.

IATA chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen said the sooner costs rise ""the better” as the increase would be spread over 25 years, rather than an ever-shortening window of time leading up to 2050.

“When are we going to see it? I can’t really say when (but) I hope soon, because if soon, it means that we will get fuel to buy and that will be great. And we also just must,” Dr Owens Thomsen said.

Dr Owens Thomsen said airlines would benefit from SAF, which would also be required by the shipping sector under net zero mandates.

“Should (governments) be looking at subsidising SAF? Yes, absolutely, that is 100 per cent what everybody should do, but then the burden falls on the taxpayer,” she said.

“However, we the world as a whole subsidised the creation of the two new energy markets that were wind and solar. Why did the world collectively think that it was right to use taxpayers’ money to support those energy markets but somehow thinks that it’s not right to do that in this energy market?”

2GB host Ben Fordham told listeners on Monday there would be some “tough conversations” taking place this week as Mr Canavan was expected to “ramp up” his push to drop the 2050 target.",https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/fbab0a43cf143d7f944ec345a6d5b140,N,,2025-10-26 22:56:50.680820
