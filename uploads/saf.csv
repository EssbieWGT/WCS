The company says this ‘sky factory’ will be the country’s first site integrating eVTOL manufacturing, flight testing, certification, training and maintenance.

The eVTOL factory will house production lines for composites, powertrains, wire harnesses, landing gear systems, flight control computers and embedded systems. India’s largest wind tunnel, a dedicated two-kilometre runway and eVTOL testing pads will complement the plant. In addition, with R&D and simulation labs, pilot training centres and MRO facilities also present, the giga-facility will support the entire eVTOL aircraft lifecycle within India for the first time.

The giga-facility will span around 500 acres and entail an investment of 13 billion rupees. In the first phase, Sarla Aviation will invest 3.3 billion rupees and put around 150 acres into use. It plans to start production in 2029, and once fully operational, expects to achieve an annual capacity of up to 1,000 units.

Sarla Aviation has developed a six-passenger hybrid-electric VTOL called ‘Shunya’. The aircraft features seven electric motors that allow it to fly at speeds of up to 250 kph. It has two battery packs and a SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) tank that together deliver a range of up to 800 kilometres. Using only battery power, however, Shunya can cover distances of up to 150 kilometres.

Based in Bengaluru (Karnataka), India’s so-called Silicon Valley, Sarla Aviation began operations in 2023. The company aims to launch Shunya as the world’s most affordable flying taxi.

Nevertheless, Rintel added that to accelerate the country’s sustainability efforts, the Dutch government must invest, noting that a national SAF fund would enable cooperation to drive change.
“Now is the moment to position the Netherlands as a leader in sustainable aviation.” KLM concluded that a national SAF fund should focus on three things.
First, it would have to make SAF affordable for airlines, bridging the gap between alternative and fossil fuels.
“The national SAF fund could be financed through the revenues from the existing Dutch aviation tax,” KLM stated.","Following the publication of an independent advisory report on the Netherlands’ future, KLM has issued a statement calling for the country’s government to invest in a national sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) fund, which would enable the Netherlands to accelerate the production of alternative fuels and reduce emissions.

In a statement on December 12, 2025, KLM, the flag carrier of the Netherlands, said it endorsed the report’s conclusions, including the importance of aviation in safeguarding the country’s prosperity and innovative ecosystem.

“Aviation and Schiphol are crucial to our economic strength: they connect the Netherlands to the world and are essential for trade, employment, and our international competitiveness.”

As such, stakeholders must invest in a future-proof aviation sector rather than undermine it with, for example, additional charges and/or taxes. Growing taxes would only negatively impact the Netherlands’ competitiveness and the country’s global connectivity, KLM warned.

While KLM noted that it has been investing in more fuel-efficient aircraft, as well as SAF, which is “one of the most effective means of reducing aviation CO2 emissions,” to achieve the goal of blending 14% of SAF by 2030, “alternative fuels must become more affordable and widely available.”

Like with wind and solar energy, government investment can make a difference in securing the future supply of SAF, the Dutch airline added.

Marjan Rintel, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of KLM, reiterated that the airline supported the report’s conclusions. Called the ‘Wennink report,’ which was ordered by the country’s caretaker government in September, it focused on the state of the Netherlands’ economy.

In his foreword, Peter Wennink, the former CEO of ASML, famous for its role in making computer chips, warned that while the Netherlands is “a wonderful country” with “smart people, strong businesses, and a society where we care for each other,” the foundations are starting to crumble. “If we do not take action, our quality of life will decline rapidly.”

The report, in Dutch, is available in full here.

Nevertheless, Rintel added that to accelerate the country’s sustainability efforts, the Dutch government must invest, noting that a national SAF fund would enable cooperation to drive change.

“Now is the moment to position the Netherlands as a leader in sustainable aviation.”

KLM concluded that a national SAF fund should focus on three things.

First, it would have to make SAF affordable for airlines, bridging the gap between alternative and fossil fuels. “Based on current prices, an annual investment of €60 million [$70.3 million] could already deliver an additional 1% SAF blend.”

Second, the fund would need to focus on accelerating production, including access to raw materials for SAF and the removal of barriers to the development of SAF infrastructure. This would allow the country to significantly progress in scaling up the production of environmentally friendly fuels.

Lastly, KLM said that investing in the development of next-generation (e)SAF technologies could help the Netherlands cement its position as the leading country in European innovation initiatives.

“The national SAF fund could be financed through the revenues from the existing Dutch aviation tax,” KLM stated.

Currently, the Netherlands has a plan to increase its aviation taxes, adopting a similar, distance-based approach used by the United Kingdom, for example. From January 1, 2027, the country would apply a €29.40 ($34.47) per-passenger levy on short-haul flights to destinations within the European Union (EU) or for itineraries up to 2,000 kilometers (1,079 nautical miles) from Amsterdam.

Medium-haul journeys of between 2,001 km and 5,000 km (2,699 NM) would have a per-passenger tax of €47.24 ($55.39), while long-haul departures would be taxed at €70.86 ($83.09).

The first phase of the project was aimed at converting the Venice refinery from a conventional facility into a biorefinery. This was achieved by repurposing existing units, which previously processed crude oil, to handle renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil and non-edible vegetable oils. The conversion leveraged Honeywell-ENI’s Ecofining® technology.

The scope of work encompassed all engineering services leading up to ENI’s Final Investment Decision (FID), as well as engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) activities. The plant was designed with a production capacity of 400,000 tonnes per year, targeting the supply of renewable diesel, naphtha, and LPG to the local market.

The second phase, which began in 2025, involves the expansion of the Venice Biorefinery. It includes all engineering services required to support ENI’s FID and subsequent EPC execution. This part of the project increases production capacity from 400,000 to 600,000 tonnes per year, with the strategic goal of starting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production by 2027.

However, total emissions increased by 11% compared to Season 9. The report attributes this to a change towards primary data collection for business travel, resulting in a more accurate carbon footprint.

Jeff Dodds, CEO of Formula E, says the season proved that “elite sport and sustainability are not mutually exclusive – they are mutually reinforcing.

""Our purpose is clearer than ever: to accelerate sustainable human progress through the power of electric racing.”

Optimising global logistics

A key factor in the championship's sustainability efforts is its logistics. Formula E moved its global hub to Valencia, Spain, whose port proximity allows for optimised freight routes and greater use of sea freight.

In partnership with DHL, the series prioritises ships using sustainable biofuels. The Valencia hub transition was completed for Season 11, despite challenges like a flood in October 2024.

The championship also used sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for freight between its Berlin and Shanghai races through DHL’s GoGreen Plus service.

Paul Fowler, Vice President Motorsports at DHL, says the collaboration shows what is possible ""when logistics and sport work together."" He notes they have identified practical ways to reduce emissions, such as optimising routes and moving to sea and road transport.

New benchmarks and net zero certification

Formula E’s sustainability credentials were strengthened in Season 10. It was ranked first in the Global Sustainability Benchmark in Sport for the second consecutive year with its highest score of 85%.

The series also became the first sport to be awarded BSI’s Net Zero Pathway certification. This award provides independent assurance of an organisation's carbon inventory and climate targets.

Matt Page, Senior Vice President at BSI, explains: “Sport has the opportunity to play a leading role in our transition to a sustainable world. This achievement reflects a deep, long-term commitment to credible climate action.”

Expanding social impact

The series has also expanded its social initiatives.

Julia Pallé, Vice President of Sustainability at Formula E, says: “We believe electric racing can do more than inspire – it can directly create change... we’re a series not focused on pledges and aspirations, but delivering true progress.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/f9358c393e73a4dded9748a6c65d1f30:2a75c822d01b7e5830488b20b1a4fa19/s10-track-shot.webp.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 13:56:48.450530

IATA says airlines are now paying up to five times the price of fossil fuel, driven by limited supply and “poorly designed mandates” that have allowed fuel suppliers to pass on significant compliance fees to airlines, effectively doubling the standard SAF price premium.
This regulatory burden is intensifying the cost squeeze on low-fare and regional carriers, whose razor-thin margins depend on minimal fuel expenditure.
“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park.
But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonisation of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Walsh.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has criticised European and UK Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates, claiming that the cost of SAF compared to conventional fuel has escalated dramatically.

This regulatory burden is intensifying the cost squeeze on low-fare and regional carriers, whose razor-thin margins depend on minimal fuel expenditure.

Speaking the Association’s Global Media Day in Geneva this week, IATA Director General Willie Walsh warned that the majority of airlines with commitments to use 10% SAF by 2030 will be “forced to reevaluate” these targets, posing a major challenge for the industry’s long-term decarbonisation strategy.

“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonisation of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Walsh.

The parties believe that the partnership has the potential to advance HEFA and next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF pathways

The parties intend to jointly evaluate the future development of New Rise Louisiana, a SAF facility comparable in size to XCF's New Rise Reno facility of ~40 million gallons

HOUSTON, TX / ACCESS Newswire / December 12, 2025 / XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX); Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (""Southern""); and DevvStream Corp. (""DevvStream"") (Nasdaq:DEVS) (together ""the parties"") today announced a non-binding tripartite memorandum of understanding (""MOU"") to jointly explore the potential development of a next-generation low-carbon fuels platform designed to accelerate SAF adoption, expand domestic capacity, and integrate environmental-attribute monetization into a unified customer offering.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, while global demand is expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, supporting a global market of more than $25 billion. By that time, approximately 4 billion people are expected to live in countries that utilize SAF for air transportation. Looking ahead to 2050, the global SAF market could exceed $250 billion. This collaboration is intended to position the parties around a unified platform that directly supports this long-term growth.

The collaboration would seek to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways while advancing the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes. As part of the negotiation of a binding agreement, the parties expect to evaluate the commercial viability of developing a HEFA-based SAF facility in Louisiana.

Potential Unified Commercial Platform and Strategic Integration

The parties intend to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement which, if executed, would create a collaborative venture that intends to develop a unified commercial platform that enables customers to procure fuel, logistics services, and environmental-attribute value through a single integrated offering. If developed, this structure would be expected to simplify procurement, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance long-term customer retention across the aviation and industrial markets.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, said:

""This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform - linking production, logistics, and environmental-attribute systems into a seamless value chain. If we succeed in combining Southern's developmental stage biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology, DevvStream's environmental-attribute and digital MRV capabilities, and XCF's HEFA production and commercial infrastructure, we see the potential to build a revolutionary end-to-end system that unlocks new value for customers and potentially accelerate the scaling of SAF in a disciplined, capital-efficient way.

""Our goal is to modernize how low-carbon fuels are produced, certified, and delivered - not as isolated components, but as an integrated solution aligned with the needs of global aviation and corporate sustainability programs.""

Potential Environmental-Attribute Monetization and Digital Infrastructure

A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform's low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (""LCA"") methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream, said:

""Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment. This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths - XCF's production expertise, Southern's developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream's environmental-asset monetization capabilities - to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.""

Potential Multi-Pathway SAF Collaboration and Offtake Framework

The parties intend to explore a long-term offtake framework under which XCF could purchase SAF which will eventually be produced by Southern, subject to mutual agreement on commercial terms, in order to capitalize on long-term global demand for SAF.

A key anchor for the potential collaboration is Southern's planned biomass-to-fuel facility in Louisiana, expected to produce approximately 28 million gallons of SAF and 220 kilotons of methanol per year, supported by an estimated $1.4 billion total project investment, according to Southern.

The parties further intend to explore multiple SAF production pathways with the goal of accelerating the adoption of SAF worldwide to address the forecasted industry demand noted above, including:

Southern's in-development, next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF platform;

XCF's HEFA-based SAF platform; and

Joint carbon-intensity and co-product optimization strategies

Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern, added:

""We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit. We are eager to work together to further develop our experimental $SAF token on Solana with DevvStream. Further, we believe Louisiana has the workforce, infrastructure, and feedstock resources to become a national leader in low-carbon fuels, and we see this potential collaboration as a major step toward that future.""

Exploration of New Rise Louisiana SAF Facility

The parties plan to assess the potential development of New Rise Louisiana, a proposed HEFA SAF facility. The evaluation process is expected to include engineering, permitting, feedstock integration, logistics, and financing strategies.

XCF and Southern also plan to evaluate municipal financing pathways in Louisiana, following recent momentum from the Louisiana Community Development Authority, which authorized up to $402 million in potential revenue bonds for Southern's biomass-to-fuel project, subject to additional approvals, documentation, and market conditions. While not representing committed capital and there can be no assurance that any such bonds will ultimately be issued or that any particular amount of funding will be available, the authorization underscores Louisiana's growing role as a U.S. clean-energy manufacturing hub. Any XCF participation in Louisiana municipal financing strategies would be separate from and in addition to Southern's existing authorization. There can be no assurance that XCF will be able to secure any Louisiana municipal financing.

Cooper added:

""We believe Louisiana offers a compelling combination of infrastructure, talent, and policy support. We expect our evaluation of New Rise Louisiana will allow us to determine whether our modular HEFA platform can complement Southern's developing biomass capabilities while fitting squarely within our disciplined, capital-efficient growth model.""

The MOU reflects a shared intent to collaborate on SAF and other low-carbon fuel opportunities. Any specific offtake arrangements, investments, or project development activities described in this release remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, internal corporate approvals, and any required regulatory or permitting approvals. Accordingly, the MOU does not commit any party to proceed with any particular transaction or project.

Luxury FBO Million Air Austin (KAUS) and leading fuel supplier Avfuel Corp. came together to boost sustainable aviation operations at Austin Bergstrom International Airport with the addition of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The SAF—which went into service on Nov. 20, 2025—provides a meaningful solution for operators seeking to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from flight operations. This marks the first SAF location in Texas for both companies, offering a consistent supply of SAF specifically for the airport’s business and general aviation traffic.

“Austin is a thriving, business-centric city that also deeply values environmental responsibility,” said Roger Woolsey, CEO of Million Air Interlink. “Bringing SAF to Million Air Austin is about giving our customers meaningful options that align with both their travel needs and their sustainability goals. At Million Air, we believe sophistication and responsibility go hand-in-hand, and this step in our Beyond Green initiative reflects our commitment to making choices that support both our customers and our planet.”

“The Million Air team has been an exceptional partner to work with in expanding sustainable fuel solutions,” said Mark Haynes, Avfuel’s vice president of sales. “We’re proud to collaborate with them to establish our first consistent SAF-supplied location in Texas and help further their corporate initiatives on sustainability.”

The SAF, originating in Texas, has a targeted blend percentage of 30% neat SAF to 70% traditional jet fuel. For every 8,000-gallon truckload of fuel, the SAF provides a 19 metric ton reduction in carbon emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. This is equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered by 19.1 acres of U.S. forests per year. In its neat (pre-blended) form, SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

This initiative is part of Million Air’s Beyond Green sustainability program—a company-wide commitment to responsible aviation practices. The Beyond Green platform focuses on integrating more sustainable solutions across Million Air’s network, from renewable energy investments and facility efficiencies to greener fuel options, like SAF. Million Air Austin joins Million Air Albany (KALB), which partnered with Avfuel to bring SAF online this summer.

SAF is made from renewable and sustainably sourced waste materials, like used cooking oil. Once blended with conventional jet fuel, SAF is a drop-in solution that meets ASTM D1655 specifications and performs to the same standards as traditional jet fuel—requiring no changes to aircraft, fuel infrastructure or handling procedures.

The award represents a significant milestone for the project and for Imperial County, one of California’s most economically challenged regions.

The Jobs First Grant will support critical activities, including geotechnical engineering, foundation design, agricultural preparation, and procurement of key components for SVE’s integrated clean-energy system. These steps are essential to advancing construction readiness and securing full project financing for the $1.28 billion renewable infrastructure development, which will create 250 direct full-time living wage jobs and 15,000 jobs from planning through construction and plant start-up. The project will work in tandem with Imperial Valley College and the Imperial County Workforce Development Office to maximize local training and hiring opportunities.

“The Jobs First Grant accelerates the final steps needed to bring one of California’s most important clean-energy and agricultural revitalization projects across the finish line,” said Dave Rubenstein, president & CEO of California Ethanol + Power. “Sugar Valley Energy will deliver long-term climate benefits, stable employment, and a transformative new industry for Imperial County.”

The Catalyst Last Mile Proposal was submitted by IVEDC in partnership with CE+P, which has already invested $27 million to advance SVE from concept to shovel ready. The grant will immediately support jobs for key local project partners, including Landmark Consultants, Duggins Construction, Benson Farms, and Dubose Design Group and enable the project to begin construction on foundational elements of the ethanol plant.

“This award represents a major step forward, not only for the Sugar Valley Energy project, but for thousands of Imperial Valley families who deserve access to high-quality jobs and long-term economic opportunity,” said Timothy Kelley, president & CEO, Imperial Valley Economic Development Corporation. “The Jobs First Collaborative is helping remove barriers that have historically held this region back.”

Developed by CE+P, Sugar Valley Energy will be the first-of-its-kind project in North America. Once operational, the integrated biorefinery campus in Brawley, California will produce more than 73 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol, 771 million standard cubic feet of renewable natural gas (RNG), and 41 megawatts of renewable electricity each year from sustainably grown sugarcane.

Sugarcane cultivated on more than 48,000 acres of Imperial County farmland will serve as feedstock for the project, creating new revenue streams for more than 50 farming entities and supporting 2,000+ local agricultural jobs. The crop replaces less profitable forage crops and will help fill the void left by the 2025 closure of the Spreckels Sugar Company plant, which eliminates hundreds of jobs and dismantled California’s last sugar-beet processing industry.

Imperial County continues to face persistent underinvestment and the highest unemployment rate in the nation, notably 20.2% as of July 2025. The Jobs First Grant helps remove barriers to economic mobility by:

Strengthening workforce development and local hiring pathways

Expanding clean-energy and wastewater infrastructure

Supporting agricultural diversification and resilience

Creating jobs in a future-facing, low-carbon industry

Catalyzing regional investment tied to more than $200 million in federal investment tax credits.

A recent impact analysis found that construction and startup operations for SVE will generate more than $928 million in direct economic activity, creating 15,000+ construction and startup jobs and 250 long-term, family-sustaining operations jobs.

As California implements AB 30 and prepares for statewide E15 adoption, Sugar Valley Energy is positioned to become a major producer of ultra-low-carbon renewable fuel that supports the state’s climate goals and Low Carbon Fuel Standard.

Supply chain certification standards For a second consecutive year, Formula E was awarded first position in the Global Sustainability Benchmark in Sport with a best-ever score of 85%.","Formula E's Season 10 operations demonstrate how motorsport logistics can drive emissions reductions while delivering competitive performance on a global scale.

The championship's Season 10 Sustainability Report reveals strategic supply chain innovations that could offer valuable insights for logistics professionals managing complex international operations.

Between 2023 and 2024, Formula E achieved a 55% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions against its baseline, according to its Season 10 Sustainability Report. However, the championship's total emissions rose by 11% compared to Season 9, primarily due to the transition from secondary assumptions to primary data for business travel across each team in the championship.

Jeff Dodds, CEO of Formula E, says: ""Season 10 proved once again that elite sport and sustainability are not mutually exclusive – they are mutually reinforcing.

""From using sustainable aviation fuel across continents to leaving lasting legacies in host cities through our Better Futures Fund, our purpose is clearer than ever: to accelerate sustainable human progress through the power of electric racing.""

Optimising freight routes

Formula E restructured its logistics network in Season 10, implementing a new global hub in Valencia, Spain, which replaced its previous logistics base at Donington Park in the UK. The strategic relocation could demonstrate how proximity to major transport infrastructure can transform freight efficiency.

The new hub's location near a major port allowed Formula E to optimise its freight routes and increase its use of sustainable sea freight. The championship partnered with DHL to prioritise the use of ships powered by sustainable biofuels, shifting away from more carbon-intensive air freight where operationally feasible.

Formula E successfully completed its logistics transition by the start of Season 11 despite challenges including an unexpected flood in Valencia in October 2024. This resilience in supply chain operations highlights the importance of contingency planning in complex logistics networks.

The Valencia facility provides Formula E with enhanced capabilities for managing equipment across its global race calendar.

By centralising operations in a location with direct access to Mediterranean shipping routes, the championship reduced transit times and improved coordination between freight movements and race schedules.

Sustainable aviation fuel integration

The championship also successfully used sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to transport freight between Berlin and Shanghai using DHL's GoGreen Plus service. This service uses a book and claim system, with SAF used by air carriers and the emission reductions allocated to shippers as certificates.

Paul Fowler, Vice President of Motorsports at DHL, says: ""Our collaboration with Formula E shows what's possible when logistics and sport work together.

""By partnering closely and rethinking freight strategies, we've identified practical ways to reduce emissions – optimising routes and shifting to sea and road transport – while ensuring the championship runs smoothly.""

The partnership between Formula E and DHL could illustrate how shipper-carrier collaboration can identify emission reduction opportunities without compromising operational performance. The modal shift strategy, prioritising sea and road transport over air freight, represents a practical approach to freight decarbonisation.

The integration of SAF into Formula E's logistics operations demonstrates the viability of alternative fuels in time-sensitive freight movements.

While SAF currently represents a premium cost compared to conventional jet fuel, the championship's commitment to its use could help drive broader market adoption and scale economies in the sustainable aviation sector.

Supply chain certification standards

For a second consecutive year, Formula E was awarded first position in the Global Sustainability Benchmark in Sport with a best-ever score of 85%.

The championship reaffirmed its environmental credentials, aligning with standards including ISO 20121, ISO 14064 and the IWA 42 framework for climate governance and emissions transparency.

Formula E also became the first sport to receive BSI's Net Zero Pathway certification. The Pathway provides independent assurance across an organisation's carbon inventory, targets and management controls to help ensure net zero goals are realistic and achievable.

The certification process required Formula E to demonstrate comprehensive measurement and reporting of emissions across all operational scopes. This level of scrutiny ensures that sustainability claims are supported by verifiable data and aligned with internationally recognised climate science targets.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/f9358c393e73a4dded9748a6c65d1f30:2a75c822d01b7e5830488b20b1a4fa19/s10-track-shot.webp.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 11:56:24.707371

A new generation of aircraft One of Delta’s main goals this year has been to procure more than 35 sustainable aircraft.","Delta’s centennial year was not a time for looking back at the past. In fact, in the hundred years since its founding in Macon, Georgia, US, the airline has rarely had such a progressive 12 months.

Across 2025, Delta made good progress against its fuel efficiency targets, it struck up some partnerships to develop cutting-edge prototypes of planes and cut down on the use of unsustainable materials across its flights too.

The carrier, which is now based in Atlanta, also surpassed its near-term fuel savings goal, delivering more than 55 million gallons of jet fuel savings from operational improvements in Q1 alone.

It’s an achievement that has helped save the firm more than US$125m, as well as move the dial on its pursuit of net zero.

Delta’s focus on improving efficiency

Delta's cross-enterprise Carbon Council was instrumental in the savings it made on fuel in 2025.

The council implemented a few important measures to this end, including weight reduction on board, technology to track and reduce Auxiliary Power Unit usage between flights, optimised aircraft speed and routing, new landing procedures and drag reduction technologies like ‘winglets’.

Though the impacts of these initiatives are fairly small in isolation, together they helped to make a good dent in Delta’s emissions.

The US-based airline also launched a programme called ‘Green Station of the Year’ in an effort to encourage its employees to change behaviours and contribute to fuel savings in their day-to-day work.

Thanks to this programme, lots of Delta’s frontline team members are now competing against one another to see who can be most sustainable.

In September, Delta joined up with Maeve Aerospace to help it expedite the development of hybrid electric aircraft for regional flights.

Compared to today's regional aircraft designs, Maeve's aircraft aims to reduce fuel consumption and emissions by up to 40% using conventional jet fuel, with further lifecycle emissions reductions possible when using SAF.

“As we work toward the next generation of aircraft, we look to partners like Maeve who embody the bold, forward-thinking innovation we champion at Delta – solutions that advance aircraft design, enhance operational efficiency, elevate employee and customer experiences, and cut emissions,” says Kristen Bojko, Vice President of Fleet at Delta Air Lines.

A year of unusual innovations

Elsewhere, Delta decided to deepen its working relationship with Airbus. This renewed collaboration saw the two companies test fello'fly – a flying technique inspired by migrating geese that pairs flights to improve fuel efficiency.

Using this technique, a pair of aircraft fly concurrently, with one creating an uplift that can markedly improve the fuel efficiency of the other.

Airbus says that the practice can reduce fuel consumption by 5% on long-haul flights.

Delta also added MicroTau to its Sustainable Skies Lab. MicroTau is an Australian aerospace technology company that is known for creating external cladding for planes that mimics shark skin. This, the start-up says, reduces drag and saves fuel.

The technology can be applied to an aircraft's fuselage, wings and tail and may improve fuel efficiency by up to 4% according to MicroTau's estimations.

Delta is also testing finlets, fins similar to those fish have, that can be installed on the back of an aircraft on the fuselage to reshape airflow and reduce drag.

The carrier finalised modifications of the split-scimitar winglet upgrade on its 737-800 fleet this year, marking the completion of adding the most advanced winglet technology available to all existing fleets that can be modified.

Delta’s investments in SAF

Delta says it is on track to increase its usage of sustainable aviation fuel by 50% compared to last year.

In 2025, the carrier collaborated with the likes of Shell Aviation, Montana Renewables and the Port of Portland on a project that saw the first-ever commercial scale delivery of SAF to an airport – Portland International Airport.

According to Airbus, SAF can reduce an airline’s emissions by up to 80% and has the potential to deliver net negative emissions in certain circumstances.

The problem with SAF has always been supply, though. Currently, there isn't enough available to meet global demand for even a week.

Investments from the likes of Delta will be crucial in scaling the fuel as time goes by.

Thanks to its forward-thinking approach this year, Delta was named one of the world's Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company for the fifth time, ranking number three in the Corporate Social Responsibility category for its efforts on SAF.

A new generation of aircraft

One of Delta’s main goals this year has been to procure more than 35 sustainable aircraft.

Though 2026 is just around the corner, the company says that it is on track to do so.

On average, these new planes are more than 25% more fuel efficient per seat mile than the aircraft Delta has retired since 2019.

With approximately 90% of Delta's carbon emissions coming from jet fuel each year, the airline is keeping its focus on those modifications that are within its control while the next generation of aircraft and supporting technologies become more mature and more accessible.

Creating a more sustainable travel experience

Keeping with that same thinking, Delta officially rolled out a new range of paper cups across its entire operation this year, replacing plastic cups for all flights.

The airline began final testing of the cups on transcontinental domestic flights in 2023, completing testing in 2024 before teams worked through inventory, supply chain and logistics to make the transition possible.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b9353d940f88d4abc637cedac4d8a49a:31f953c6fba549c6d858c596f7907842/delta-s-centennial-year-saw-the-airline-make-some-progress-against-its-net-zero-targets.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 10:56:48.705514

Abstract

This study investigates the effect of the concentration of sustainable jet fuel components on selected physicochemical properties of blends with fossil Jet A-1 fuel, as well as on parameters characterizing the combustion process in aircraft turbine engines. The analyzed physicochemical properties were density, net heat of combustion, and fractional composition (50% recoverey temperature and viscosity at −20 °C) of the fuel blends. The combustion process was examined using test rigs equipped with GTM 140 and DGEN 380 engines operated at different rotational speeds. For each engine speed, the fuel mass flow rate and the combustion chamber temperature were determined. The functions mf = Ae^(−Ea/RT) were derived, corresponding to the kinetic equations of the complete combustion reaction chain. The (Ea/R)mf values obtained using the trend line method for the GTM 140 engine were found to be linearly related to those obtained for the DGEN 380 engine. A deviation from linearity was observed for blends containing 5% of various synthetic components. These findings support a new hypothesis that the same intermolecular interactions between liquid fuel components that account for the non-additivity of physicochemical properties also contribute to the parameters of combustion kinetics in turbine engines. Tests on the turbine engine provided preliminary validation of this hypothesis.

""Our team is excited to share Syntholene's objectives with investors, build lasting partnerships, and take our place in the rapid growth sector eFuel sector. We are ready to get to work to build an opportunity for shareholders to participate from day one of this new era for low-cost, high-performance, and carbon-neutral eFuels.""

Syntholene is actively commercializing its novel Thermal Hybrid Production Process for low-cost clean fuel synthesis. The target output is ultrapure synthetic jet fuel (""eSAF"" or ""eFuel""), produced at 70% lower cost than the nearest competing technology today. The company's mission is to deliver the world's first truly high-performance, low-cost, and carbon-neutral synthetic fuel at an industrial scale. Syntholene's production pathway aims to drive emissions reduction into carbon negativity, and to actively reduce carbon in the atmosphere with every liter consumed.

eFuel Market

Synthetic aviation fuel is a clean, drop-in-ready jet fuel made from renewable power, green hydrogen, and captured CO₂, offering up to 90% lower lifecycle emissions and helping airlines meet global decarbonization mandates without changing their aircraft engines or retrofitting.

The broader global aviation fuel market size was valued by Fortune Business Insights at USD 391.23 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from USD 431.70 billion in 2024 to USD 819.73 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 8.35% during the forecast period (source).

According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global sustainable aviation fuel market is projected to expand from an estimated USD 2.06 billion in 2025 to approximately USD $25.62 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 65.5%.

Within these projections lies the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, the European Union's landmark mandate requiring airlines and fuel suppliers to adopt sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at all major EU and EU Economic Zone airports starting in 2025. The regulation sets binding, rising SAF blending requirements of 2% in 2025, 6% in 2030, 20% in 2035 and up to 70% by 2050, creating one of the world's largest guaranteed markets for clean jet fuel (Source).

The EU has also paired this demand-side measure with a supply-side subsidy, offering up to 6€ per liter to airlines that purchase eSAF specifically (Source: Reuters). The combination of mandated demand and subsidized supply underscores the EU's seriousness about bolstering the rapid scale-up of eSAF production from producers like Syntholene.

The First-tier Tribunal’s approach since Pawar Late 2025 has seen a deluge of ‘late’ appeal decisions by the First-tier Tribunal.","2018: The “Martland Test”

In Martland, the Upper Tribunal set out a three-stage test for considering whether to grant permission for an appeal that is out of time. The three stages are:

1. The Length of the Delay.

The Tribunal first considers how long the delay in filing the appeal was and assesses whether the delay was significant.

2. The Reasons for Default.

Next, the Tribunal examines the reasons for the delay, and evaluates whether the appellant had good reason for not acting within the time limit.

3. The Circumstances of the Case.

Finally, the Tribunal will balance the merits of the appeal against the potential prejudice which would be caused to both parties if permission were granted or refused. The Upper Tribunal in Martland emphasised that this balancing exercise should give special weight to the need for efficient conduct of litigation and adherence to statutory deadlines.

2025: Medpro’s impact on the Martland Test

In July this year, the Upper Tribunal endorsed the Martland test, in Medpro Healthcare Ltd. v HMRC [2025] UKUT 255 (TCC) (Medpro). However, the Upper Tribunal ultimately diverged from Martland’s approach, stating that when considering stage three of the Martland test, time limits are important but there is no legal basis for concluding that they should take precedence over the merits of the case.

Judgments of the Upper Tribunal are binding on the First-tier Tribunal but, while it will regard them as highly authoritative, the Upper Tribunal is not bound by its own decisions. The tests as set out in Martland and Medpro are on an even footing, with neither taking precedence over the other.

Since Medpro, the Tax Tribunals have taken a varied approach to the Martland test, generally considering both cases, some showing a preference for one test over another.

Application of the Medpro Test

The key authority for following the Medpro formulation of the test is Tajinder Pawar v HMRC [2025] UKUT 00309 (TCC) (Pawar). Having originally dismissed Mr Pawar’s appeal on its three original grounds, the Upper Tribunal was asked to consider a late fourth ground, based on the Medpro decision and its impact on observing time limits for allowing a late appeal.

Pawar concerns a significant VAT penalty imposed on First Stop Wholesale Ltd due to errors in the company’s VAT returns. In October 2017, HMRC issued Mr Pawar, who was both a director and shareholder of the company, with a personal liability notice holding him wholly and personally liable for the penalty and upheld the penalty in late 2018. In 2022, more than 3 years after the 30-day deadline, Mr Pawar applied to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to bring a late appeal. The First-tier Tribunal, applying stage 3 of the Martland test and taking account of the length of the delay, refused permission for the late appeal. Mr Pawar appealed the decision to the Upper Tribunal.

The decision in Pawar centres on this fourth ground of appeal and whether the Tribunal should follow the authority of Martland, which stated that particular emphasis should be placed on observing statutory time limits, or Medpro, which held that while observing time limits is important, it is not a factor that should overshadow the merits of the case.

The Upper Tribunal reasoned that Medpro was a more recent decision and a decision which expressly considered the Martland test. The Upper Tribunal therefore set aside the First-tier Tribunal decision and remade it, balancing the merits of the delay against the potential prejudice to Mr Pawar, if his appeal was dismissed, and to HMRC if it was granted, without giving special weight to the need to observe time limits.

The Upper Tribunal nonetheless found that, even without according special importance to the need for statutory time limits to be respected, the prejudice to Mr Pawar of the appeal being dismissed was not sufficiently great as to outweigh an unjustified delay of more than 3 years. The Upper Tribunal therefore dismissed the appeal.

Pawar therefore affirmed the Medpro approach. One might expect the First-tier Tribunal to adopt Medpro going forwards, given it is both the most recent approach and the approach confirmed by the Upper Tribunal in Pawar (having had the opportunity to consider both Medpro and Martland). However, a proliferation of recent First-tier Tribunal decisions has made it difficult to discern any single approach.

The First-tier Tribunal’s approach since Pawar

Late 2025 has seen a deluge of ‘late’ appeal decisions by the First-tier Tribunal.

In Lands Luo Limited v HMRC [2025] UKFTT 1207 (TC) (Lands Luo), the First-tier Tribunal acknowledged the tension between Martland and Medpro but quickly discounted it: “We should state immediately that we doubt that the difference in the approach to the test to be applied to determine whether to grant permission to bring a late appeal between Martland and Medpro is likely to lead to different results in many cases. This is because when it comes to evaluating all the circumstances of the case, factors specific to the case are always likely to determine the outcome” (para 70).

The same ambivalence appears in Choudhury v HMRC [2025] UKFTT 1274 (TC) (Choudhury), which was heard prior to the judgments in Medpro, Pawar and Lands Luo. The First-tier Tribunal acknowledged these later decisions but nonetheless felt it unnecessary to seek further representation from the parties, having satisfied itself that it would have reached the same conclusion under both Medpro and Martland tests.

This uneasy balance may be sustainable for so long as the Tribunal can satisfy itself that both tests would, on the facts, result in the same outcome. However, if the tests were to result in conflicting outcomes, it is not certain which would prevail. The First-tier Tribunal in Lands Luo ultimately favoured Martland on the basis that it was consistent with the approach of the Court of Appeal in BPP Holdings v HMRC [2017] UKSC 55, which was affirmed or permitted by the Supreme Court. The First-tier Tribunal panel in Lands Luo was larger than usual, particularly for this type of hearing, and notably included Dingeman LJ, the Senior President of Tribunals. However, despite the seniority of its panel the decision is ultimately of limited assistance as it makes no reference to the judgment in Pawar. A similar preference for Martland was shown more recently in Dounetas [2025] UKFTT 1416 (TC) (Dounetas) in which case the First-tier Tribunal referred to Medpro but acknowledged it was under appeal.

Conversely, in each of Wolf & Whistle Limited v HMRC [2025] UKFTT 01187 (TC) (Wolf & Whistle) (heard before the Pawar judgment), Hamasala v HMRC [2025] UKFTT 01261 (TC) (Hamasala) and Dreyer v HMRC [2025] UKFTT 01336 (TC) (Dreyer) (both heard after the Pawar judgment) the First-tier Tribunal applied Medpro but noted that it would have reached the same decision had it applied the stricter test in Martland.

HMRC’s view

It is not clear whether HMRC has a settled internal view on which is the correct test. In Len Lothian Holdings Limited [2025] UKFTT 01254 (TC) (Len Lothian), HMRC agreed with the taxpayer that the First-tier Tribunal should apply the test as set out in Martland. However, although Len Lothian was heard after the judgment in Medpro, it was heard before the judgment was handed down in Pawar. By contrast, in Figa Store Limited v HMRC [2025] UKFTT 1260 (TC) (Figa Store), which was heard after the judgment in Pawar, the parties agreed that the First-tier Tribunal should apply the test as adjusted by Medpro; and similarly in Dounetas it was HMRC that sought to bring the Medpro authority into the appeal at the hearing. It is unclear whether this represents a change in HMRC’s stance following Pawar or merely indicates a lack of consistent approach with HMRC preferring one or the other when it best suits their circumstances.

Practical takeaways

Fortunately, we understand that Medpro has been appealed, so the question of whether special weight should be given to observing time limits should be resolved authoritatively by the Court of Appeal.

For now, the case law suggests that the First-tier Tribunal is prepared to follow the approach set out in Medpro in seeking to ensure a fair balance between procedural integrity and the merits of the appeal. As a result, the merits of late appeals to the First-tier Tribunal may be given greater consideration than they might have previously. However, this is not certain and it is notable that no decision to date has found the outcome of Medpro or Martland would be different. Until we have definitive guidance from a higher court, it is possible that, faced with a fact pattern that results in different outcomes depending on which test is applied, a Tribunal could prefer the approach set out in Martland without the Medpro modification.

Anyone considering a late appeal should ensure they have strong reasons for the delay and should make clear in submissions any potential prejudice they would suffer if the appeal is not allowed.",https://www.addleshawgoddard.com/globalassets/insights/white-with-accent/dispute-resolution4.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 12:57:33.440837

About Project Starling

Situated in Workington, UK, Project Starling is envisioned as a pioneering Power-to-Liquid facility designed to produce approximately 25,000 metric tons of e-SAF annually using renewable electricity and advanced electrolysis. The initiative is currently in the FEED phase, with construction anticipated to commence in 2028. Full operational capability is targeted for 2031.

When operational, the plant is projected to cut lifecycle emissions by up to 89% compared to fossil-based jet fuel, offering a major contribution to the UK’s emission reduction goals and the broader aviation decarbonization roadmap.

In July 2025, the project secured a significant boost when it received a £6 million grant—the largest awarded to any e-fuels company—from the UK Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuel Fund Window 3. This funding is intended to accelerate SAF development in the country and aligns with government ambitions under the Jet Zero Strategy and upcoming SAF mandate.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-12 08:58:11.173678

Consequently, AIIB remains committed to investing in aviation infrastructure that enhances connectivity, strengthens regional cooperation and delivers shared prosperity, while advancing a forward-looking vision grounded in climate resilience and sustainability.","The aviation sector is undergoing a profound transformation. With global air travel demand projected to reach 25 billion annual passengers by 2052, the industry’s focus has shifted from growth alone to sustainable growth, balancing connectivity and net-zero ambitions. Within this context, multilateral development banks (MDBs) play a pivotal role in mitigating risks, fostering innovation and mobilizing capital and expertise for aviation.

This understanding was reflected in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank’s (AIIB) Transport Knowledge Week 2025, themed “Sustainable Transportation: Clean Skies for Tomorrow” (Oct. 27-31, 2025). Through a mix of workshops and site visits, the event aimed to advance a more efficient, green, connected and integrated aviation ecosystem by fostering meaningful dialogue among stakeholders and identifying emerging trends, challenges and opportunities shaping the sector’s future.

Over 20 speakers and 20 participants from airlines, airports and aviation authorities from 13 AIIB members participated in the event. A wealth of in-depth insights and case studies was shared by experts from policy, industry, financing and research. These insights highlighted the need for harmonization in standard-setting for sustainable aviation fuel to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2025. They also highlighted projections indicating that advanced air mobility, a new business model in aviation that features electric air taxis and low-altitude economy, will generate over 7,000 jobs in the next 20 years. Case studies such as the Hong Kong International Airport’s Sky Pier Terminal and autonomous-vehicle corridors indicated the shift toward multimodal connectivity enabled by smart mobility.

The case study of the Kunming Changshui Airport, which received four stars – the highest possible rating among all airports in China in the 2024 Dual Carbon Airport evaluation by the China Civil Airports Association – showed how international standards and global expertise enabled the AIIB project to set new sustainability benchmarks. Beyond financing the Kunming Changshui Airport’s expansion and green development, AIIB developed a comprehensive green airport assessment framework integrating local and international standards, proposed tailored decarbonization action plans and advocated for gender inclusivity throughout the project.

Two other AIIB-financed aviation projects in Thailand and China were discussed at the event workshops and amplified AIIB’s sustained efforts in mobilizing expertise, transferring knowledge and building capacity. Other MDBs, such as the World Bank Group, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the New Development Bank, together with their partners and clients, also showcased their financing and projects in aviation.

Participants also visited sites such as the state-of-the-art Beijing Daxing International Airport, the Chengdu Tianfu International Airport, the Chengdu Eastern New District, the Comprehensive Bonded Zone, and the Cargo Terminal of the Tianfu Airport. The visits demonstrated that as aviation continues to serve as a catalyst for connectivity and economic growth across industries, the associated infrastructure needs to be thoughtfully integrated into broader industrial, urban and national development strategies. The discussions and insights following the site visits also underscored that airports are not isolated transport hubs but strategic enablers of sustainable growth and regional cohesion. Integration is key.

Through the event, AIIB aimed to provide a knowledge-sharing platform for aviation stakeholders, enabling participants to gain insights relevant to their varied national contexts and development priorities, be it in terminal design and best practices, engaging with MDBs for airport financing or innovative solutions to achieve sustainable aviation. AIIB also called for immediate efforts to build smart aviation infrastructure for tomorrow – one that expands access jobs, essential services, new markets and regional and global cooperation, while safeguarding the planet we all share.

Transportation is at the heart of AIIB’s mission, accounting for 20% of its investment portfolio, with total approved financing of USD14.7 billion across 19 economies as of writing. Consequently, AIIB remains committed to investing in aviation infrastructure that enhances connectivity, strengthens regional cooperation and delivers shared prosperity, while advancing a forward-looking vision grounded in climate resilience and sustainability.",https://www.aiib.org/en/news-events/media-center/blog/2025/_img/transport-knowledge-week-2025-aviation-efficiency-connectivity-sustainability/1110.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 10:57:06.685808

As Europe’s largest diversity-focused aviation programme, we’ve seen firsthand how access and opportunity change lives.

With over 5,000 graduates and 500 flying scholarships awarded in the last 5 years, this new support will allow us to expand our reach, enhance our programmes and create even more pathways for young people across the UK to explore and build careers in aviation.

Today’s announcement follows the launch of applications for the next cohort of Aviation Ambassadors in September, a group of industry professionals who work to raise the profile of aviation careers alongside undertaking their professional roles in the sector.

Alongside inspiring the next generation of aviation leaders, the government is also backing the development of technologies to help futureproof the sector. This includes greener aviation through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, which will provide economic security for the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market by guaranteeing a set price per unit for UK producers.

An additional £63 million is also being invested to speed up construction on new SAF production plants, to unlock the opportunities of the green fuels sector in aviation to deliver growth and create skilled jobs on the journey to reach net zero.

Caitlin Gould, TEC Women CIC and TEC Girls Director, said:

At TEC Women CIC, we are thrilled that our TECgirls Reach for the Sky Festival and Take Flight education programme has been funded to help more girls explore STEM roles in aviation and aerospace.

Our Take Flight festival has been building year on year, with over 500 girls and 1,000 people attending last year and our education outreach has provided practical hands-on-learning for over 200 girls across Cornwall, including a work experience week.

In 2026, we plan to continue to grow this programme, working with more industry partners and reaching new audiences across rural and coastal locations. Without support from the challenge fund, ambitious events like our festival would not be possible.

Tara Connelly, Programmes Manager at Bright Futures UK, said:

We’re incredibly grateful to receive this funding. It will make a huge difference to the young people we support in hospital and help us provide tailored aviation outreach to a demographic that has previously been excluded.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-12-12 08:58:15.239428

The award, in the category of Excellence in Energy – Downstream, was presented at a gala in New York, thus consolidating the company's leadership in the promotion of renewable fuels.

The Platts Awards are considered the most prestigious awards in the global energy sector, recognizing excellence in innovation, leadership and sustainability. The jury granted this award to Repsol for overcoming the dual challenge of supplying affordable and reliable energy while advancing decarbonization across its operations and products.

In addition, Repsol stood out among its peers thanks to its large-scale production of renewable fuels and their successful implementation, achieving significant progress in its commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Repsol currently sells NEXA diesel at almost 1,500 service stations in Spain and Portugal, making it one of the largest distribution networks for 100% renewable fuels in Europe.

The company already operates the first plant in the Iberian Peninsula in Cartagena to produce 100% renewable fuels on a large scale, with the capacity to produce 250,000 tonnes of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) per year. In 2026, a second plant will be added in Puertollano with an annual capacity of around 200,000 tonnes of renewable diesel for road and maritime transport.

Repsol recently achieved a technological milestone by producing gasoline of 100% renewable origin on an industrial scale at its Tarragona complex, positioning the company at the forefront of energy innovation. Repsol's 95 NEXA gasoline is already available at more than 20 service stations in Spain, with the aim to reach 30 points of sale before the end of the year.

Repsol’s NEXA fuels of 100% renewable origin, both diesel and gasoline, have formulations that are similar to conventional premium fuels, enabling the engine perform at its best and remain in optimal condition. They deliver the same performance, offering greater protection, cleanliness and performance optimization and are fully compatible with current vehicles without the need for modifications.

Combustion engines - whether petrol, diesel, or hybrid - today represent more than 98% of the European vehicle fleet and 87% of sales in Spain so far this year. Therefore, to achieve the climate objectives set by Spain and Europe, it is essential to recognise the contribution of 100% renewable fuels and to review the European regulation on CO2 emission standards for cars and vans, which proposes a ban on the combustion engine by 2035.

Fly Smooth with Sergeant Oil & Gas Fuel is the heart of every flight.","Flying makes people happy because planes can take them all over the world. But a plane can only fly when it has the right fuel. This fuel is like a special drink for the engine. Without it, the plane cannot move at all. Sergeant Oil & Gas provides the correct fuel for pilots, flight schools, and heliports so every flight goes well.

Why Planes Need Different Fuel

Not all planes are the same. Some are big. Some are small. Some have wings that spin fast, others go slow. Because planes are different, they need different fuel. Using the wrong fuel can make engines sad. Our team makes sure every plane gets the right kind of fuel for its engine. This keeps flights safe and easy.

Jet Fuel for Big Planes

Big planes and jets use jet fuel. This fuel helps engines run high in the sky. It can handle cold and windy heights. Airports and airlines need fuel that works the same every time. At Sergeant Oil & Gas, we provide jet fuel that pilots can trust. Clean fuel and on-time delivery mean planes fly on schedule without surprises.

Avgas 100LL for Small Planes

Smaller planes use aviation gasoline. This fuel has a special number called octane. It helps engines stay strong and smooth. Flight schools, private pilots, and heliports get help from Avgas 100LL aviation fuel international suppliers like us. We make sure fuel is safe, clean, and ready to go. Small planes fly better when the fuel is right.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel for a Cleaner Sky

Some people want the sky to be clean and fresh. That’s where sustainable aviation fuel comes in. It’s a type of fuel that can help planes make less smoke. Pilots can mix it with normal fuel. We at Sergeant Oil & Gas provide safe types of sustainable aviation fuel so flights are greener. This helps airports, airlines, and pilots care for the planet while flying safely.

Special Fuel for Piston Engines

Some planes have small engines that tick-tock like a clock. They need special fuel called piston-engine fuel. Commercial aviation piston engine fuel suppliers make sure these planes get the right juice. We supply fuel that keeps engines steady, whether planes fly short trips, training flights, or longer missions. Our fuel helps pilots feel confident, and planes run smoothly.

Keeping Fuel Clean and Safe

Fuel must be clean. Dirty fuel can make engines sad or stop planes from flying. At Sergeant Oil & Gas, we follow rules for safe fuel. We store it carefully and deliver it safely. Whether it’s aviation gasoline for sale worldwide or local fuel, our team ensures planes get the best quality. Clean fuel means happy engines and calm pilots.

Matching Fuel to Plane Type

Different planes, different engines, different fuel. A jet can’t drink Avgas. A small piston plane can’t drink jet fuel. We help pilots pick the right fuel for each plane. This stops mistakes, keeps engines healthy, and makes flights smoother. Knowing what fuel works best is the first step to stress-free flying.

Fuel for Airports and Heliports

Airports and heliports have lots of planes. Fuel needs can change fast. Big airports need lots. Small heliports need smaller amounts.

“I recently had the honour of signing an agreement that marks an important step for aviation and climate efforts in Oman,” she said.
“Oman is quickly emerging as a leader in the circular carbon economy, showing how industrial capabilities and progressive policies can turn waste carbon into valuable products.
Across the GCC, countries such as Oman and Saudi Arabia are demonstrating how carbon can be continuously reused, opening new opportunities for circular carbon systems,” she said.
Oman’s access to varied carbon-rich feedstocks and its strong industrial infrastructure make it an ideal location to lead circular carbon initiatives, the company said.","Muscat: US-based carbon recycling company LanzaTech has signed an agreement with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank Group’s private-sector arm, to work together on developing Oman’s first-ever Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) project, reports Zawya.

LanzaTech CEO Jennifer Holmgren said the initiative will focus on converting waste industrial gases in Oman into ethanol, which can then be refined into sustainable aviation fuel—allowing aircraft to run on recycled carbon instead of fossil fuels.

Holmgren described the agreement as a major milestone. “I recently had the honour of signing an agreement that marks an important step for aviation and climate efforts in Oman,” she said. “Oman is quickly emerging as a leader in the circular carbon economy, showing how industrial capabilities and progressive policies can turn waste carbon into valuable products. Across the GCC, countries such as Oman and Saudi Arabia are demonstrating how carbon can be continuously reused, opening new opportunities for circular carbon systems,” she said.

Stage 1 of the project is in progress, with LanzaTech and the IFC carrying out a joint feasibility study that includes assessing feedstock and product markets, estimating capital costs, and developing financial models to create a clear path to a final investment decision and project rollout.

LanzaTech’s biorecycling technology will be central to SAF production in Oman. The process captures carbon-rich gases directly from energy-intensive industrial sites and prevents them from entering the atmosphere. The carbon is then turned into sustainable substitutes for fossil-based materials, used in products such as detergents, textile fibres, packaging and transport fuels.

Currently, six commercial plants around the world operate using LanzaTech’s technology. The company says it is creating a new value chain by converting captured carbon into ethanol and then into SAF, and believes Oman is well-placed to become a regional—and possibly global—hub for circular carbon solutions.

Holmgren said the project could make a significant difference for Oman. “Projects like this could produce around 80,000 tonnes of SAF every year, boosting Oman Vision 2040, creating jobs, and supporting economic diversification,” she said.

She added that SAF is expected to contribute more than 60% of aviation’s CO₂ reductions by 2050. “If only 15–20 more plants of this scale are built globally, we could see more than 1.5 million tonnes of sustainable fuel produced annually — which would be 50% more than what the world produced last year. That is the kind of scale needed today,” she said.

Oman’s access to varied carbon-rich feedstocks and its strong industrial infrastructure make it an ideal location to lead circular carbon initiatives, the company said. The project strengthens Oman’s position as a regional frontrunner in carbon circularity.

Highlighting the importance of the initiative, the IFC said: “This project aligns with Oman Vision 2040 and its goals for sustainable industries, economic diversification, and employment generation — a priority for the World Bank Group in the country. This collaboration builds on IFC’s growing engagement in Oman following major agreements announced during the World Bank Group Day last year.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-10.png,N,,2025-12-12 06:56:16.452357

KLM is investing significantly in cleaner, quieter and more fuel-efficient operations. Alongside fleet renewal, SAF is currently one of the most effective means of reducing aviation CO₂ emissions, cutting emissions by at least 65% across its entire lifecycle compared with fossil kerosene. KLM blends more SAF each year than required under the European mandate and has entered into a long-term offtake agreement to support the development of the Netherlands’ first dedicated SAF production facility in Delfzijl. However, to achieve the joint ambition of a 14% SAF blend in the Netherlands by 2030, alternative fuels must become more affordable and widely available.

The creation of a national SAF fund aligns with European efforts to accelerate the transition to sustainable fuels, including the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), and would make ‘SAF Made in Holland’ a reality. In KLM’s view, a national SAF fund should focus on the following:

1. Making SAF affordable for airlines

Bridge the price gap between SAF and fossil kerosene through an incentive fund, enabling airlines to actually use SAF and encouraging them to choose sustainable options. Based on current prices, an annual investment of €60 million could already deliver an additional 1% SAF blend.

2. Accelerating production and access to raw materials

Improve access to sustainable raw materials for SAF production and remove barriers to accelerated SAF infrastructure development. This would allow the Netherlands to make significant progress in scaling up domestic production.

3. Investing in (e)SAF innovation to become a European leader

Support the development of next-generation (e)SAF technologies and take a leading role in European innovation initiatives. The Dutch government has already taken a promising first step by joining a European pilot within the STIP programme.

Biodiesel in the United States: A Market Overview

Biodiesel is a biodegradable, renewable fuel produced from vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled cooking grease. It stands out as one of the few sustainable fuels that can be used directly in existing diesel engines with minimal modifications. It is commonly blended into petroleum diesel in ratios such as B5, B20, or used as B100 (pure biodiesel), depending on emission goals and engine compatibility.

Across the United States, biodiesel is widely used in:

Transportation (trucks, buses, marine vessels)

Agriculture (tractors, harvesters, farm machinery)

Commercial and municipal fleets

Industrial applications

Home heating systems through Bioheat®

Power generation in backup and distributed energy systems

As states and industries commit to renewable energy targets, biodiesel continues to gain traction as a scalable and proven low-carbon solution, especially in sectors where electrification is difficult or economically unfeasible.

Key Market Growth Drivers

1. Government Policies and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)

Government incentives remain a dominant force behind biodiesel adoption. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires fuel refiners to blend increasing amounts of renewable fuels—including biodiesel—into the national fuel mix.

One of the most influential incentives is the Biodiesel Tax Credit (BTC), which helps reduce costs for producers and end users, making biodiesel more competitive with petroleum diesel.

In December 2023, the EPA established volume requirements for the RFS program for 2023–2025, including categories such as:

Biomass-based diesel

Cellulosic biofuel

Advanced biofuel

Total renewable fuel

This update also introduced regulatory improvements across the RFS program, streamlining compliance and strengthening incentives for producers. Although the EPA has not yet finalized renewable electricity provisions for RIN generation, the broader regulatory updates signal ongoing commitment to expanding renewable fuel use nationwide.

These policies collectively support industry profitability, feedstock investment, and long-term growth.

2. Surge in Demand for Low-Carbon and Sustainable Fuels

As climate priorities intensify, American industries, states, and large fleet operators are aggressively adopting low-carbon fuels. Biodiesel reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions significantly compared to petroleum diesel, making it an essential tool for meeting sustainability commitments.

States with stringent climate targets—such as California, Washington, and New York—are accelerating biodiesel adoption through mandates, incentives, and carbon reduction programs.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Pathways to Commercial Liftoff report highlighted the potential of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to dramatically reduce aviation emissions. As biodiesel technologies advance, synergies between biodiesel production and SAF pathways further strengthen the overall renewable fuels ecosystem.

Corporate fleets, public transportation agencies, and agricultural operations are also incorporating biodiesel into daily operations, driven by:

Sustainability reporting requirements

Corporate ESG goals

Pressure to reduce carbon footprints

Lower sulfur emissions and engine benefits

With both environmental and economic appeal growing stronger, biodiesel’s demand trajectory continues to rise across industries.

3. Technological Advancements in Biodiesel Production

Innovation across biofuel production technologies is making biodiesel more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally competitive. New processing methods—including improved transesterification and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) technologies—are enhancing fuel quality and increasing output yield.

Researchers are also exploring next-generation feedstocks such as:

Algae-based biofuels

Waste-derived feedstocks

Advanced grease and fat recycling technologies

These advancements reduce dependence on traditional vegetable oils and help producers diversify supply chains.

In 2023, Be8, a global bioenergy company, expanded into the U.S. market by investing in both biofuel technology and cereal-based ethanol ventures—demonstrating increasing foreign investment in U.S. biofuels and the broader potential for technology-led expansion.

As technology improves and production costs fall, biodiesel becomes even more competitive with petroleum diesel and other renewable alternatives.

Market Challenges

1. Feedstock Price Volatility

Feedstock accounts for the majority of biodiesel production costs. Prices for key feedstocks—including soybean oil, corn oil, canola oil, and animal fats—can fluctuate sharply due to:

Weather disruptions

Global supply chain instability

Agricultural policy changes

International trade dynamics

When feedstock prices rise, biodiesel becomes less price-competitive compared to fossil diesel, challenging producers and squeezing profit margins.

2. Competition from Other Renewable Fuels

While biodiesel is a major renewable fuel, it faces growing competition from:

Renewable diesel (RD)

Electric vehicles (EVs)

Hydrogen fuel cells

Renewable diesel, in particular, poses a strong challenge because it is chemically identical to petroleum diesel, requiring no modifications to existing infrastructure.

The expansion of EV incentives and charging infrastructure also risks shifting demand away from liquid biofuels in the long term.

For biodiesel to maintain market share, ongoing innovation, cost reduction, and feedstock diversification will be essential.

United States Biodiesel Market Breakdown by Key Segments

1. Biodiesel for Fuel Applications

The fuel segment remains the largest and fastest-growing application in the U.S. Commercial trucking fleets, transit systems, shipping operators, and government agencies increasingly use biodiesel blends such as B20 to reduce emissions and extend engine life.

Federal and state renewable fuel policies continue to bolster demand, positioning the fuel segment for robust long-term expansion.

2. Biodiesel from Vegetable Oils

Vegetable oils—primarily soybean, canola, and corn oil—account for the largest share of biodiesel feedstock.

Growth in this segment is supported by:

Expanded domestic crop production

Advances in oil extraction technology

Federal support for U.S. agriculture

However, this category remains vulnerable to global commodity market fluctuations.

3. Biodiesel from Animal Fats

Animal fats, tallow, and used cooking grease offer a cost-efficient alternative to vegetable oils. Their increasing availability from rendering plants and food processing facilities supports growing biodiesel output.

This segment benefits from:

Waste-to-energy sustainability initiatives

Lower feedstock costs

High energy return compared to vegetable oils

Environmental policies encouraging recycled feedstocks are expected to accelerate growth in this category.

Key State Markets

Final Thoughts

The United States biodiesel market is moving into a decade defined by policy-driven acceleration, technological innovation, and rising corporate sustainability commitments. With a projected value of US$ 20.29 billion by 2033, biodiesel is positioned to remain an essential component of America’s renewable fuel strategy—especially in hard-to-electrify sectors like trucking, agriculture, maritime, and industrial operations.

Although challenges such as feedstock price volatility and competition from renewable diesel and electric mobility persist, the biodiesel sector continues to evolve. Expanding feedstock sources, adopting new processing technologies, and strengthening state-level renewable fuel policies will be key to ensuring long-term growth and energy resilience.

As the U.S. moves towards a cleaner, more sustainable fuel economy, biodiesel stands out as a practical, scalable, and economically viable solution—fueling a greener future while strengthening domestic energy independence.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/693bcfaccdbf4f001d79f8a5.jpg",N,,2025-12-12 06:56:58.509500

The Grangemouth oil refinery operated for over a century, and was Scotland’s only oil refinery before refining officially ended in April this year.","I beg to move,

That this House has considered the future of the oil refining sector.

It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr Western. I am pleased that this debate has attracted considerable support, particularly from north of the border, and that today The Times had a timely editorial on this issue.

My constituency is in northern Lincolnshire on the south bank of the Humber, which has been christened “the UK’s Energy Estuary”. In recent years, the Humber has become a world-leader in the offshore and renewable energy sector—something we are proud of locally. However, while the Humber is full of opportunity for offshore and renewable energy and will play a significant role in the UK’s net zero efforts, we must not overlook the UK’s carbon energy needs as we make the transition to cleaner energy sources. We must face the fact that a significant portion of our total energy consumption still comes from oil, gas and coal and will continue to do so. The UK’s annual total primary energy consumption is around 130 million to 140 million tonnes of oil equivalent; fossil fuels made up roughly 79% to 81% of that in the year 2022-23.

The Humber has played a significant role in ensuring that that demand is met. Until the crisis at Lindsey oil refinery in my constituency earlier this year, the Humber could boast of producing a third of the UK’s refined fuel, with two of the UK’s six major oil refineries based in the Humber region. Now, as we approach the end of 2025, only four operational refineries remain in the UK, following this year’s closure of Grangemouth, with significant job losses, and the uncertainty at the aforementioned Lindsey refinery where over 400 people are employed. Even more striking is the fact that the number of refineries is down from 18 in the 1970s.

Sadly for the oil refining sector, most people do not even realise that it exists or appreciate its importance, yet the sector is a vital part of the UK’s energy security. A number of our crucial sectors rely on it, including the transport industry and defence sectors. All Members will know that oil refineries produce products that are essential for our critical energy needs, such as petrol, diesel, jet fuel and fuel oil. The Lindsey refinery has a capacity equivalent to around 35% of British petrol consumption and 10% of British diesel, and also supplies aviation fuel to Heathrow via pipeline.

Yet the House of Commons Library states:

“Refinery output in 2024 was 48 million tonnes. This was 55% below the 1973 peak.”

Output in 2024

“was around 14% below levels from the late 2010s and more than 40% below output from the start of the century.”

That is worrying considering that refineries supply 47% of the UK’s final energy demand, as 100% of aviation, 97% of road and 61% of rail transport still relies on liquid fuels. The refineries also support 100,000-plus jobs across the UK, with 4,000 directly in the refineries. We collect £37 billion annually in tax—that is duty and VAT—from them, and they deliver low-carbon fuels that have an impact equivalent to removing 3 million cars from the road each year. That is not to mention the fact that ours are among the lowest-carbon refineries globally—in fact, 80% of the UK’s top import partners have a higher carbon intensity—yet despite their importance we have seen the closure at Grangemouth and the uncertainty at Lindsey.

What does the future hold? UK oil refineries continue to face a number of challenges. Of course demand for refined products will decrease as the country continues to reduce its emissions in accordance with the legally binding commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, though that target may change. Moreover, energy is the single largest cost of operating a refinery. The industry faces high energy costs, and carbon costs negatively impact the competitiveness of UK refineries. UK refineries are essentially competing with one hand tied behind their back while their competitors pay little or nothing in carbon costs. That is on top of the issue of unequal access to decarbonisation opportunities.

Our route to lower emissions must not come at the price of deindustrialisation or at the expense of our energy security. As an editorial in The Times today points out, some in the Government are so hostile to fossil fuels and so beholden to the green ideology that they are willing to sacrifice our future income and tolerate the jobs that are being lost. We must put the national interest first. Moreover, our climate targets are still some way off, so in the meantime we must continue to rely on the products that refineries produce.

The sector remains vital for today’s economy, yet our refineries are closing. We must realise that closing UK refineries does not reduce demand; it merely shifts production abroad. That, of course, often leads to higher emissions. We are thereby exporting jobs outside the UK while failing in our efforts to cut emissions. Losing further capacity would therefore leave the UK increasingly dependent on imports and the unpredictability of global politics, relying on other nations that often have weak rules on environmental protection, labour rights and safety.

Moreover, once a refinery closes, it does not return. The skills, infrastructure and investment are lost permanently. We must also consider the impact on the local economy and local people that closures cause. At Lindsey, over 400 people are directly employed on the site, and well over 1,000 rely on it through the supply chain. As North Lincolnshire council said in its position statement on Lindsey oil, the implications of any closure of the site will have far-reaching consequences for the local economy and the people employed directly and indirectly.

The council has stated that the potential closure of the refinery will have a significant impact on local market confidence, particularly following the turmoil at British Steel earlier this year. As such, failure to properly support the businesses impacted could multiply exponentially the impact of the closure. Moreover, the south Humber bank, where the site is located, relies on the interconnectivity of its industrial supply chains. As such, the refinery is not an isolated operator but an integral node in a wider network that supplies products to downstream users, and disruption at one site can quickly ripple across the regional economy.

These integrated clusters work in tandem, reflecting the modern industrial model, and our economic resilience relies on the system being maintained, thereby ensuring long-term industrial sustainability in the UK. I note the Scottish Affairs Committee’s conclusions on the handling of Grangemouth, which can be found in the Committee’s recently published report on Scotland’s oil and gas industries. I am sure the Chair of the Committee, the hon. Member for Glasgow West (Patricia Ferguson), will delve more deeply into the detail of the report, though let me quickly say now that the report stated that both the UK and Scottish Governments should have acted sooner to prepare for the crisis in Falkirk.

The hon. Member makes an important point: it is the case that such decisions are not solely commercial; the Government must consider, more widely, energy security and the impact on the economy.

In preparation for this debate, I received representations from various interested parties that are dependent on the oil refining sector. They have outlined their concerns, some of which I have mentioned already, and the solutions they would like to see put forward. One issue that has been mentioned to me is the expansion of the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism to include oil refineries’ products. As Members may know, the CBAM is a tax levied on goods at the border based on their carbon content. Expanding the CBAM to products from oil refineries based overseas, as the Government proposed in their autumn Budget, would enable domestic oil refineries to remain competitive and stop them fighting with one arm tied behind their back.

I mentioned that the refining sector is subject to ever-increasing regulatory burdens and carbon pricing. Sadly, the impact of net zero politics, particularly the UK emissions trading scheme, is driving rapid and sustained deindustrialisation of the British economy. Refining receives substantially lower free allowances under the scheme compared with other industries, such as steel and cement, and ETS costs are one of the highest expenditures in a refinery’s operating budget. Competitors in other regions do not face those costs, which seriously damages the competitiveness of UK refineries. We must realise that the ETS damages our energy security and should be urgently repealed. Longer-term solutions may include bringing refined products fully into the UK CBAM or ensuring that the UK retains control over refineries in any future UK-EU carbon market linkage agreement. If we do not want to let this issue get any more out of control, we must act now.

Before concluding, I refer back to the situation at Lindsey oil, because the company is in administration. We have a situation in which FTI Consulting, acting on behalf of the official receiver, is engaged in discussions with potential buyers and investors. Those talks are rightly confidential, and when questioned, Ministers have repeatedly said that they are awaiting the recommendations from FTI. That inevitably feeds speculation through the grapevine that angers employees and their union representatives. I have held meetings with two consortia that are interested in buying the whole site and continuing operations, and the leader of North Lincolnshire council has held discussions with a third. Do the Government support a deal that would retain the refinery complete? Until now there has been no answer. I again ask the Minister: do the Government favour that option and, if necessary, would they provide some support?

Have the Government instructed FTI to prioritise jobs? A letter from Unite the Union to the Secretary of State throws that into doubt. In the letter, Unite says:

“In this vein you informed me and the Unite reps for the refinery on two occasions that you had advised FTI that bids which save the jobs should be prioritised and that if needed, there could be government money for a viable bid which saved the site.”

Is Government money available? The reply seems to throw doubt on all of that. The reply from the Minister for Energy to Sharon Graham at Unite says that the Government

“have made repeatedly clear that long-term and sustainable employment is a priority for the Government”,

but that does not necessarily mean it is a priority that has been passed on to the official receiver.

At a meeting with me and the hon. Member for Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes (Melanie Onn), the Minister for Energy assured us that if the worst came to the worst and the refinery were to close, or there were to be large- scale job losses, one option would be for the Government to work with MPs, local authorities and other agencies to form a taskforce to consider what help and support would be available to revive the local economy. Is that offer still open? My understanding is that the Government have said that there will be no further redundancies until the end of March, which I welcome. Could today’s Minister clarify whether the Government are meeting the cost of that, or whether the costs will be taken into account by the administrators and the amount available to creditors adjusted accordingly?

The future of not just Lindsey oil but the whole oil refining sector is at stake. The Government must review their current position and act to secure the industry for the future.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Western. I thank the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) for securing this important debate. I speak in my capacity as a member of the Scottish Affairs Committee, which has recently published a report, “The future of Scotland’s oil and gas industry”, as part of our inquiry into Scotland’s role in the UK’s energy transition. I thank the hon. Member for allowing the report to be tagged to this debate on the Order Paper.

The closure of the Grangemouth oil refinery, following the Petroineos announcement in November 2023 that refining operations would cease at the site, was a key focus of our report. The Grangemouth oil refinery operated for over a century, and was Scotland’s only oil refinery before refining officially ended in April this year. The refinery’s closure has left some 400 employees and the wider Grangemouth community facing deep uncertainty. The Prime Minister’s pledge of £200 million through the National Wealth Fund for future industries at the site was welcome, as was the Scottish Government’s announcement of £25 million to help establish a just transition for Grangemouth. The extra £14.5 million announced in the Budget was another welcome boost. However, the Government have not yet set out how that will be delivered and how it will tangibly result in jobs.

The Committee visited the Grangemouth site during our inquiry. We heard oral evidence from Petroineos, the company that owns the refinery, from its parent company Ineos, from union representatives, from Project Willow and from the Forth Valley college, which provides the skills support for former refinery workers. Our report concluded that both Governments should have acted sooner to set in motion plans for the site’s future and to prepare for resulting job losses. That lack of action created an employment gap and hardship to the local community that could have been avoided.

We said in our report that Grangemouth is the “canary in a coalmine” and a stark warning of what is to come. That warning proved prescient: just a few months on from the publication of the report, ExxonMobil announced its plans to shut the Mossmorran ethylene plant in February 2026. That is yet another example of Scotland’s rapidly changing industrial base. As we move away from our reliance on fossil fuels, industrial transition will only accelerate. For our national resilience, we must learn from these cases.

The Grangemouth case has illustrated the need for the Government’s active stewardship in the energy transition. Our report recommends that the Government set out clear principles that outline the conditions and actions that underpin a just transition. We recommend principles that emphasise the importance of early Government intervention, proactive engagement with workers and communities, and a focus on decent jobs. Those principles should draw on best practice and ensure that transitions are fair and planned, not rushed and reactive.

Last month, the Minister for Energy, my hon. Friend the Member for Rutherglen (Michael Shanks), said that announcements will be forthcoming on the investment proposals brought forward by the National Wealth Fund. I understand that the first project to be funded on the site was announced today: a groundbreaking biotech company using by-products from whisky distillation, which is jointly funded by both the UK and Scottish Governments’ £3 million of investment and hopes to deliver over 300 good jobs. That announcement is welcome.

The timescales of establishing future industries at Grangemouth and the jobs that they will create all hinge on the types of investment proposal put forward. I commend the Committee’s report to all hon. Members. A response from the Government is expected by Christmas; I hope that that response will recognise the sentiment in our report that continued momentum on Grangemouth’s future is vital. Project Willow must not be left to gather dust while jobs are at stake. Communities that have powered our economy for generations deserve certainty and a fair future.

That may be a fair point. I said at the beginning of my speech that I am not a climate change sceptic. Everybody is prepared to do their bit.

I have already mentioned wind farms, but what about solar energy? In Lincolnshire we are prepared to have solar energy on our farmland, but in my constituency 16,000 acres of the most productive land in the entire country—enough land to feed the city of Hull every single year—is put under solar farms, with panels manufactured in China, destroying our ability to feed ourselves. There has to be a balance, but at the moment we do not have one. We are importing so much from our dear friends in Norway that they are opening 250 exploration wells.

This debate, secured by my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Immingham, is extremely timely. The closure of Lindsey oil refinery is a complete disaster. It employs many of our constituents and is vital for the whole of our industrial infrastructure. We need strong domestic refining capacity. The Secretary of State goes on about energy security all the time, but that would strengthen energy security at a time when we are already importing two thirds of our gas and increasing volumes of refined fuels.

I would not mind these green policies, but we are not actually contributing to tackling global warming; we are simply exporting carbon emissions to other countries. It is complete madness. If we were sensible about this, and if it were possible to get some sort of global recognition of the problem, maybe we could start to tackle it. Relying on foreign refiners means exporting jobs and value overseas while leaving Britain more exposed to global price shocks and geopolitical risks. Expansion of the UK refining sector protects thousands of highly skilled, well-paid jobs. It also supports an entire region and supply chain in engineering, fabrication, logistics and maintenance. Those are precisely the jobs that sustain industrial communities and create apprenticeships for young people.

Refining underpins every major industrial sector. Manufacturing, aviation, defence, logistics, agriculture and pharmaceuticals all depend on reliable supplies of fuels and petrochemicals. Allowing it to pass into decline would simply shift production to countries with weaker environmental standards.

Lindsey oil refinery was a major economic anchor for our area. We know that it was put into administration. I share the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Immingham: this is a national crisis in terms of national policy, which is wrong, and of local policy. The people of Greater Lincolnshire demand action from this Government, and they demand it now.

It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair today, Mr Western. I thank the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) for securing this highly important debate, and I draw everyone’s attention to my membership of Unite the union.

Since coming to this place, I have repeatedly raised the issue of the Grangemouth oil refinery closing, with 435 jobs lost on site and 2,822 lost in the wider supply chain. Closure means an end to a century of oil refining on the site and to a generational employer for Grangemouth people. Nearly every family in the town has had someone, or knows someone, who worked at the site. There is no doubt about it: local businesses will feel the pain of the closure. The hairdressers, barbers, small independent retailers, hotels, restaurants, pubs and garages are the very businesses that make up the heartbeat of the local community and the town’s economy. They are all negatively impacted.

The closure is more than just a local constituency issue. It is Scotland’s biggest industrial issue in four decades, it is safe to say, since the end of the coalmining industry. To put the matter into the national context, the Grangemouth refinery was worth more than £400 million per annum to the Scottish economy, according to both Scottish Enterprise and PwC. While conflict rages on in Europe, British people have been susceptible to the resulting price shocks and disrupted supply chains that have impacted the oil industry in Europe. At this perilous time, with refining ending at Grangemouth, Scotland is now in the ridiculous position of importing our own oil. The energy-abundant nation of Scotland is reliant on global logistics and outside influences for our oil products. It is incredible that we have lost our self-sufficiency.

Why has this happened? Why did the refinery close? I will say something different from what right hon. and hon. Members have mentioned so far. Let me be clear: the idea that the Grangemouth refinery closed as part of trying to achieve net zero, or as part of some woke green agenda or an environmental campaign, is utter nonsense. The real reason—the heart of the matter—is Petroineos. It is made up of private capital, Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos and a foreign Government in the form of Chinese state-backed PetroChina. It controlled the Grangemouth refinery, a key piece of Scottish and British national infrastructure, and closure was a commercial decision.

Closure happened because it was more profitable for a private company to make hundreds of workers redundant and operate Grangemouth as an import terminal. It was international capital concerned with the corporate greed of a billionaire owner, with shareholder dividends their priority. That is the ruthless nature of how international capital works. Ratcliffe has massively weakened Scotland’s national economy and jeopardised our country’s energy security for his own needs. I am disgusted by Governments allowing that to happen, and by the pandering to Ratcliffe in spending billions of pounds to help with the regeneration around Old Trafford and hundreds of millions of pounds to provide a loan guarantee for his plant in Belgium.

I make absolutely no apologies for being ideological. As the country sacrificed state ownership of vital infrastructure, we lost control of our own refinery. We have seen job losses, an exodus of skills and talent, local shops closing and all the social consequences that follow deindustrialisation. That is what has happened to former industrial towns the length and breadth of the United Kingdom. For goodness’ sake! The country needs a different industrial direction, to bring an end to being at the mercy of private capital and foreign Government influence.

There is a clear, coherent case for Government ownership. It is in the public interest. In questions to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and to the Treasury, I have asked what ownership stake the UK Government are willing to take in future industries at Grangemouth. I put the same question to the Minister this afternoon.

Just as I make no apologies for being ideological in my opinion of public ownership, I make no apologies for criticising both the UK and Scottish Governments. We know that oil will be part of the energy mix for decades to come, so it is time for both of Scotland’s Governments to be bold. The existing infrastructure of the Grangemouth refinery is largely still in place, and there should be a conversion to sustainable aviation fuel there.

We have signed up to highly ambitious mandates, so let us try to meet those targets. Successful conversion of refineries is there for everyone to see—at La Mède in France, Eni’s Venice refinery in Italy and Phillips’s Rodeo refinery in the US. I say this to the Minister today: what happens at Grangemouth will go a long way in deciding how we shape our future economy, who controls it and who this Government actually serve and work for.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Western. I commend the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) for securing this important debate. I also acknowledge the contribution of the hon. Member for Alloa and Grangemouth (Brian Leishman), who spoke with his usual passion, but today I believe with a degree of anger as well, and rightly so.

A just transition supports and protects existing oil and gas sector workers through—I emphasise “through”—the transition to a world-class renewables workforce, a transition in which Scotland is well placed to lead the world. I want to share the following quote:

“‘just transition’ has now become meaningless for so many people and that’s a failure… People should feel like that’s not something done to them, but something they’re part of shaping.”

That was said by the Minister for Energy in a recent interview with the Holyrood magazine. Sadly, for thousands of workers in North sea upstream, midstream and—in the case of refining—downstream jobs, a just transition is far removed from the reality that they face.

The workers now made redundant are angry at the UK Government’s failure to support their transition. Their families and communities are also angry, as are we, their representatives. We know that the just transition is doomed to fail because of three things: first, the failure to press forward with renewable energy schemes in north-east Scotland at the urgent pace that is required; secondly, the failure to allow new exploration licences while persisting with the crippling energy profits levy on the oil and gas sector; and thirdly, the failure to protect refinery jobs at Grangemouth and Mossmorran. Today I learned that 7,000 business leaders, workers and companies have signed a letter to the Prime Minister in which they demand change to the EPL to avoid the projected 1,000 job losses per month.

Looking specifically at the situation in Grangemouth in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, the leader of the Labour party in Scotland, said that a Labour UK Government would

“step in to save the jobs at the refinery and to invest in that transition…and we would put hundreds of millions of pounds behind it to make it a reality.”

No doubt the Minister will cite the £200 million promised to support Grangemouth, and reference has been made to the Scottish Government’s contribution. Of course, today brings good news in that regard, with MiAlgae’s welcome investment announcement on top of the Celtic Renewables project. The Scottish Government are an active partner in funding those projects, and we welcome the investment. However, the funding announced today amounts to only £7.73 million in total, and the 280 jobs —perhaps more—will not be fully realised for five years, if ever. Where is the rest of the promised £200 million? Where is fulfilment of the promise made by the leader of the Labour party in Scotland? Where is the intervention that occurred for Scunthorpe? People need work now. Families need certainty, but all they face this Christmas is uncertainty. In the meantime, the refinery workforce has been largely cast aside.

Looking further afield in Scotland, including Prax Lindsey, the UK has lost a third of its oil refineries just this year, on this Government’s watch. Furthermore, it is an uncomfortable truth for the Government that the UK’s uniquely high energy costs—the highest in the G7—are one of the main factors harming the refining sector and industry more generally.

I acknowledge that the North sea basin is in decline, but the importance of sovereign capability in national security is often repeated from the Government Front Bench. It is particularly true in defence, but how can defence capability be even remotely claimed if the vital fuel needed to operate tanks, ships and aircraft is acquired in the quantities needed through imports from abroad? Those imports can hardly be described as secure in this currently very dangerous world. Refining sites, as mentioned by the hon. Member for Alloa and Grangemouth, have great potential for such things as sustainable aviation fuel production, but this remains a jam tomorrow promise. This is not remotely a positive trend for our economy, our environment, or, vitally, our national security.

I must press the Minister to address these questions. How can she tell the thousands of directly employed and supply chain workers at Grangemouth, Prax Lindsey and the many other sites and companies that are shedding workforce in the oil and gas sector that they are part of shaping the just transition? What assurance can she give those workers that the future is bright, especially when the Acorn project in my constituency faces growing uncertainty, for example? I urge her to address those questions in her speech. The destruction of the refinery jobs is a repetition of the Thatcherite coal mine closures and the steel plant shutdowns, with no plan for the workers, their families and the communities affected. We have long memories in Scotland. Only with the full powers of independence in areas such as energy policy will the workforce at Grangemouth and elsewhere in Scotland’s oil and gas sector get the priority and the just transition to the future that they so richly deserve.

It is a privilege to serve under your chairship, Mr Western. I congratulate the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) on securing this important debate, and I agree with his comments regarding the strategic importance of oil refineries for their communities—if only colleagues who were previously in government had grasped that before the decision by Petroineos to close Grangemouth in November 2023 was announced.

As has been remarked by colleagues, 2026 will mark the first year since, I believe, 1850 that Scotland does not have an oil refinery. This year marked 101 years since the start of oil refining in Grangemouth, and the date that refining ceased in April 2025 was a devastating time for the community I represent, the community of my hon. Friend the Member for Alloa and Grangemouth (Brian Leishman), the whole of Scotland and the United Kingdom. I remember sitting in the Falkirk council chamber when the announcement was made. The implications were obvious immediately: the loss of many of the highest-paying jobs in the Falkirk area, and the loss of a substantial tax base for Falkirk council and the Scottish and UK Governments. The announcement was completely unexpected for those of us in opposition parties, who were not in the know.

The failure of Government, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (Douglas McAllister) has articulated on behalf of the Scottish Affairs Committee, to prepare our community or have a plan in place for a no job loss transition at Grangemouth refinery has become symbolic of a similar story happening across industrial communities for decades. It was infuriating to find out from the Scottish Affairs Committee report that, through late 2023 and 2024, when it would have mattered, many of the decision makers failed to act to prevent the unjust transition at Grangemouth.

Petroineos confirmed to the Committee in April 2025 that, in the years prior to the announcement in November 2023, the then UK and Scottish Governments had requested information from the company, and subsequently chosen not to make an investment decision that would have saved the refinery. It was engaged for years with Government and no one lifted a finger to stop the path to the closure of refinery operations. Although I wish we had grasped the reality of the situation far more clearly in the transition from opposition to entering government, I welcome the determination of Ministers to get investment into Grangemouth quickly so that we can deliver that new industry to the community.

Today—two weeks after the Chancellor allocated further Government funding to Grangemouth to speed up investment decisions—marks an exceptionally positive announcement for the area. Up to 310 jobs are coming to Grangemouth to support the construction and operation of MiAlgae, a Scottish biotech success story. That does not, however, diminish the fact that many high-paid, high-skilled jobs have been lost, and the constant worry that they and the industry will never come back is justifiably the primary emotion that still grips my community.

We have an obligation not to repeat the mistakes of the past. We do not want the workers at Grangemouth, many of whom have not found employment since the closure in April, to be lost to the middle east, America or Norway. There is still a future for high-skilled refining workers at Grangemouth. That is why I welcome the Skills Transition Centre, announced back in February, funded out of the Falkirk and Grangemouth growth deal, which this Labour Government enhanced by £10 million when we came to power. However, the college that contains the skills centre is facing an existential financial crisis. One of the three campuses that constitutes Forth Valley college—the Alloa campus, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Alloa and Grangemouth —is directly jeopardised by the 20% real-terms cut inflicted on colleges since 2021 by the SNP Government.

The pathways for local kids to grasp the new industrial opportunities coming to our community will be actively barred if Government settlements for our further education sector are insufficient. Any consolidation that followed the closure of the Alloa campus would affect the courses available for thousands of young people in Falkirk, Stirling and especially Clackmannanshire. Kenny MacInnes, the principal of Forth Valley college, rightly reminded a conference recently that the college will be an instrumental part of whatever comes next at Grangemouth. The Scottish Government must bear that and Colleges Scotland’s recently published report in mind when they set their budget next year if they ever want to speak credibly about rebuilding opportunities in my community.

I note the attendance, and I welcome the hon. Gentleman’s presence in this debate. However, when we were talking about the Grangemouth refinery at the time that it mattered, in the previous Parliament, I note there was an active lack of interest from SNP politicians, with the exception of the former Member for East Lothian, who is no longer a member of the Scottish National party. I have raised the concern, and I have asked for direct intervention from my Government about skills funding for the college during Treasury questions. I very much welcome the enhancement of the local growth deal, which enabled the skills centre to be built.

I will talk about the future of the refining sector. Since being elected I have repeatedly made the case that the best opportunity for Grangemouth is in refining biofuels, especially sustainable aviation fuel, due to its industrial role as a fuel supplier for Glasgow and Edinburgh throughout history, its equal proximity to Scotland’s two largest and busiest airports, its operational capacity and its proximity to a town that has the infrastructure necessary to host the required contractors.

The £200 million national wealth fund commitment to Grangemouth first proposed by Scottish Labour MPs late last year, fought for by Scottish Labour Ministers and announced by the Prime Minister in February, should be spent primarily on developing a new anchor industry for our community that complements the existing skills profile of refinery workers. Ideally, we would not give private international capital a full stake in the project. Many businesses are interested in investing in refining biofuels at Grangemouth, and they are calling for policy certainty during the transitional phase into sustainable aviation fuel.

Legislative measures such as the SAF mandate and the revenue certainty mechanism go a long way towards that, after the Government picked up the work that was delayed for far too long under the previous Administration. However, I would like the Minister to address the following points. Clarity on the revenue certainty mechanism and the pre-contractual work that can be carried out is crucial. Will the Government enable pre-contractual work to be carried out, as we did through contracts for difference, so that there are no delays once the RCM comes into effect later next year?

Project Willow mentioned a proposal to delay the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids cap. Despite substantial questioning from me, that has not been addressed yet by Ministers at either the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero or the Department for Transport. Will the Government consider altering, delaying or lifting the cap following that recommendation? Finally, it would be useful to have an update on how the £200 million is being deployed, following the welcome announcement on MiAlgae this year.

If the right hon. Gentleman wants to intervene, he is more than welcome.

What the Government did not realise at the time is that when they got rid of a coalmine—each coalmine had a football team, a rugby team, a cricket team, a community club, a miners’ welfare, a brass band and a bandstand in the local welfare grounds—it destroyed whole communities, and those communities will never come back. They will never be the same again.

Fast forward 40-odd years and we have a Labour Chancellor and Government, who we would think would protect these industries. Look at the hypocrisy in that part of the world. We have Drax power station, which used to burn coal from a nearby coalmine, just a few miles down the road. I think that was shut about 10 years ago. I remember the Energy Secretary at the time was campaigning to keep it open. How things have changed! The power station now burns wooden pellets from trees chopped down in North America—in Canada. They chop the trees down and put them on diesel-guzzling cargo ships. They then chop them up into pellets using diesel-guzzling machinery on the ship. They then come to this country, are put on diesel-guzzling cargo trains and transported to Drax power station, where we set fire to them. And we say that is renewable energy. That costs the British taxpayer about £1 million a day in subsidies. I think it has cost about £10 billion so far since we have been using wooden pellets there.

Just a few miles down the road we have the perfectly good Lindsey oil refinery, which appears to be doomed, with 400 jobs at risk and a thousand more in the supply chain. If the Government are going to use taxpayers’ money to subsidise industry or keep places open, they should look at the oil refineries, because once they have gone, they are never coming back, and we have lost the community and that sense of pride.

There are not many Government Members here, to be honest—I cannot see many—although I will thank the hon. Member for Alloa and Grangemouth (Brian Leishman) for his passionate contribution. I did not catch most of it because I am a little bit deaf; I will sit a bit closer next time.

It is a real pleasure to serve under your chairship, Mr Western. I thank the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) for leading the debate. The very thrust of the issue that the hon. Member for Ashfield (Lee Anderson) underlined, and that I endorse, is how it changes communities whenever disastrous decisions are taken.

The future of the UK oil refining industry has become an increasingly urgent topic as we navigate the pressures of energy security and the transition to net zero. I should have welcomed the Minister to her position; I wish her well in it. I am not sure whether today’s is a good debate for her to be answering questions, but that is by the way—we will see how it all goes. We have seen the closure of two major oil refineries this year, so it is important that we are here to discuss the future of our fossil fuel sector across the United Kingdom.

This debate is important not just for the constituencies represented by, for example, the hon. Members for Alloa and Grangemouth (Brian Leishman) and for Falkirk (Euan Stainbank), but for us in Northern Ireland as well. Our oil came from Grangemouth and Lindsey, so the impact for us in Northern Ireland will be the same as it is for everybody else. The difference will be that we will not be getting oil from within the United Kingdom and will have to buy it from outside. That concerns me greatly.

I commend the Members who have spoken. In particular, I commend the hon. Member for Alloa and Grangemouth for his passion, which he always shows in the main Chamber and here in Westminster Hall. He puts forward his case incredibly well.

The UK’s oil-refining capacity has shrunk substantially over the past 20 years or so. As of 2023, total refining capacity stood at roughly 1.22 million barrels per day, and the UK produced around 51.45 million tonnes of refined petroleum products. Some people ask how this effects the workers. Many of us have constituents who work in the oilfields—I think nearly every constituency has them; I know I have them in Strangford—and this impacts on them as well. Northern Ireland does not have any operating crude oil refinery, and all refined fuels, such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel, are imported.

Historically, some of Northern Ireland’s fuel came from refineries across the rest of the UK, with the products shipped or piped to Northern Ireland terminals. For example, Petronas, which until 2025 operated the Grangemouth refinery, supplied almost all the fuel for Northern Ireland. We have witnessed the closure of two refineries, Grangemouth and Lindsey, and Members have outlined their concerns, whether they represent the area or are here to speak on behalf of others. There is no doubt about the significant impact on where we source fuel. Events in the wider UK refining sector, such as closures or capacity losses, will have knock-on effects on fuel security, price stability and supply chain resilience in Northern Ireland. The impact will be felt by us all.

We have witnesses the United Kingdom’s reliance on imports, and there has been a significant impact in terms of job losses, and the redundancy of engineers, technicians and maintenance workers. We also have to recognise the significant loss of skill and experience. Even if things were to change in time, those people will have moved elsewhere, so how do we start again? That is, if we are able to start again, of course.

Furthermore, the closure of refineries has an impact on associated industries such as petrochemical storage and marine freight. The impact is like a domino effect: one thing happens and it knocks on right down the line. With two large domestic refining assets having closed, the UK must now import more petrol and more diesel, which completely reduces our domestic control over fuel supplies.

I believe that we are doing our bit to improve our infrastructure and to adapt to net zero goals, but what does that mean in the meantime? I do not think anybody here does not believe that there is a role for net zero, for the green environment and for green energy, but we do not want to lose the core of our ability to produce oil for our own country. The United Kingdom’s commitment to net zero remains essential to protect the environment and for our long-term energy security, and to create new green industries. However, the recent closures of the refineries at Lindsey and Grangemouth show that the transition also brings real challenges for workers and local economies—for every economy right across this United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland—affecting all the regions and our overall industrial capacity.

The transition has to be carefully managed. It is the responsibility of the Minister and this Government to ensure that we are equipped to deal with the changes, for the benefit of everyone in this great United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I always say that we are better together, but we have got to work together as well. We have to work together for everybody. That is what I ask the Minister: how can we make sure that we can all do it better together?

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairship, Mr Western. I thank the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) for securing this important debate, and all the Members who have spoken for their contributions. I declare an interest as the chair of the all-party parliamentary group for the future of aviation, travel and aerospace—we have done a lot of work on sustainable aviation fuel—and that I met representatives of Exolum, the International Air Transport Association, LanzaJet and the Tank Storage Association in preparation for this debate.

At times of great upheaval and change, it is tempting to look to political leaders, artists or other major cultural figures to get a sense of where the world is headed. That is certainly a popular approach among historians, but I think it misses something: the often pivotal role of engineers—and I say that not just because I am one myself, or was. It is not necessary to subscribe to an entirely materialistic view of history to recognise that engineers, no matter who they work for or where they work, are often at the vanguard of the kind of technological change that enables our wider political or social ambitions to be achieved. That was true at the cusp of the industrial revolution; it was true when the white heat of technology exploded the middle class in the ’50s; and it is true now, perhaps more than ever, as we embark on the mission to undo the damage to our environment that previous technological shifts have wrought. We must secure our energy supply so that we can withstand an ever more uncertain future, and transform our late-industrial malaise into a green, prosperous and abundant economy through a truly just transition.

Data from the oil and gas industry shows that it directly supports around 26,000 jobs across the UK and indirectly supports 95,000 more. These are largely jobs in offshore drilling, rigging, catering, scaffolding, onshore fabrication yards, anchor manufacturing and vessel maintenance, and there are more. It is also estimated that there are another 84,000 jobs among the hospitality workers, taxi drivers and others who serve industrial communities and are supported by them in turn. We have seen before what happens when there is a major industrial shift and we fail to support jobs and the communities they help to keep alive—from the closure of the pits to the ongoing crisis of British Steel. We must learn lessons from past deindustrialisations to avoid similar damage to communities today.

All policy makers should dedicate themselves to avoiding the traumatic manifestations of necessary—or, at the very least, foreseeable—moments. It is vital that any job losses in this sector are mitigated by reskilling and retraining with new green investment. However, right now in 2025, we are losing our traditional refining, chemicals and existing biofuel production capability and home-grown expertise. Complexity, departmental misalignment and a lack of pragmatism in public policy are holding back the existing and future fuels sector. The Government have the power to solve those things. I hope that today we can suggest and agree some constructive next steps.

Earlier this year, Liberal Democrat colleagues and I recognised the importance of the Government’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill. Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, will be one of the main enablers of aviation’s transition from polluting liquid fossil fuels to a future of hydrogen, battery and hybrid zero emission power plants. As part of that transition, SAF has a huge role to play in creating new green jobs and delivering on our energy security goals.

Local production creates jobs, improves resilience, reduces import dependence and stabilises prices, but without efficient resource allocation and strategic investment, future refinery closures could create severe supply bottlenecks and undermine our energy independence. It is equal parts encouraging that there is consensus among the serious political parties in this country about the need for transition and energy security, and concerning that from different ends of the spectrum, the Greens and Reform are either wilfully ignorant or unwilling to accept that supporting the oil refining industry to transition is critical.

The Greens seem willing to turn their back on any of the major technologies involved in the just transition of our fossil fuel infrastructure. They are locked into the pursuit of an ideological purity that sees those companies and producers solely as the problem and not as part of the solution. Reform’s static, stagnant and staggering belief that net zero is either bound to hurt working people or just bad in and of itself, only gives them the self-satisfied and smug smile of someone who thinks they know all the answers, but that could not be further from the truth.

I completely agree. That is why we are talking about a transition. It may well bring shivers to the hon. Member’s spine to talk about transitions, but it is critical that we talk about them in a reasonable and sensible way, and about how we look forward to the future rather than to the past. Reform’s approach is equally dogmatic and damaging as that of the Green party and has already been found wanting in practice in local government.

We can only make the transition a reality if we grasp the opportunity to utilise our existing oil refining infrastructure to turn to the chemistry of the future, with a diverse set of feedstocks from a wide range of supply points. We should be working with industry on delivering that, but industry leaders tell me that on the critical steps that the Government should be taking, they are going ignored or unheard.

Let us take bioethanol, for example. At the start of 2025, the UK bioethanol sector provided 895 million litres of renewable fuel production capacity and thousands of direct and indirect jobs. It was also a significant market for British agriculture and providing critical co-products such as carbon dioxide for the NHS, and for the food and drink sector. As of December 2025, the industry has been halved, following the US-UK trade deal.

An immediate solution would be to transition that bioethanol to SAF, as the alcohol-to-jet technology being developed in the UK can convert it into jet fuel. Under the SAF mandate rules, however, bioethanol readily produced in the UK—sustainable enough for a car engine—has been deemed not sustainable enough for a jet engine. Will the Minister consider the request of industry to support the UK’s bioethanol industry to continue operations and simultaneously support SAF production by allowing bioethanol use under the SAF mandate? The upcoming call for evidence on the role of crops under the UK SAF mandate should be released urgently, and a pragmatic approach taken.

Similarly, opening hydrogen storage subsidies to include liquid fuel infrastructure would ensure that existing assets could play a role in the hydrogen economy. Hydrogen storage is critical, but hydrogen production and usage are also critical to our future renewable goals and to providing the supply of SAF that will be required to decarbonise aviation. DFT rules state that, to make compliant SAF in the UK, hydrogen must be green hydrogen—rightly—and cannot be supported by the hydrogen production business model, a scheme established by DESNZ to get UK hydrogen production off the ground. That alone is not controversial. However, there is no green hydrogen available in the UK that will not be supported by the HPBM, which means that a portion of SAF using these renewable molecules will be uncompliant and, essentially, very expensive fossil jet fuel, despite it actually being green. I convey to the Minister the ask from industry that the DFT and DESNZ should be urgently working together to ensure interconnectivity with hydrogen policy and SAF policy, so that SAF producers are not penalised for using domestic industry?

I know that the hon. Member has a lot of knowledge on this issue. I think that looking at all the options that maintain capability is critical. What might come out of this is an ask for this Minister— or potentially the aviation Minister, the hon. Member for Selby (Keir Mather)—to sit down with our APPG, in which there is a lot of expertise, to talk about some of the ways that we can maintain capability but also achieve our transition and net zero goals.

A pragmatic approach could be not to apply the rules to smaller users of hydrogen—for example, where hydrogen accounts for less than 5% of feedstock—while a longer time is taken to consider the impacts for large-scale hydrogen users.

I now turn to our wider ecosystem of logistics infrastructure. Pipelines, storage and distribution networks are essential for connecting supply and demand, especially as the market shifts towards sustainable fuels and as we look to improve our energy security. For example, Exolum, which runs a 2,000 km onshore pipeline network that delivers 40% to 50% of the aviation fuel used for UK flights each year, is transforming its aviation fuel pipeline network to supply SAF.

To unlock further investment in the infrastructure and ensure a just transition, industry is calling for long-term policy signals, such as extending and increasing renewable fuel mandates; targeted incentives like business rates relief and payment holidays for new infrastructure; inclusive subsidy schemes for hydrogen storage; and fast-tracking obligations for renewable liquid heating fuels.

At present, most support for fuel infrastructure is directed towards large-scale production projects. Conversely, investment in storage and distribution infrastructure is increasingly undertaken at an operator’s own risk and often ahead of immediate market need. That imbalance is amplified by a business rates system that can disincentivise new investments and high-end capital projects—including energy transition initiatives—especially when the investment is by overseas companies likely to be looking for more cost-effective placement of funding in countries with more generous and strategic policies. How will the Minister ensure that policy and investment frameworks can support storage and distribution infrastructure, thereby enabling the development of a future-ready energy system, capable of responding to evolving market conditions and minimising supply chain risks?

The Liberal Democrats urge the Government fully to grasp the opportunities that our industrial capacity and workforce capability offer our country, to lead the world in a transition to next-generation fuels and energy. It is in our blood and our tradition as a country to grapple with these big technological questions, so it should be up to us to show what real leadership on the just transition looks like—not just because great feats of engineering are impressive in their own right, which they are, but because a whole generation of people whose lives and careers have been shaped by our oil refineries and wider energy sector, and future generations, are counting on that leadership. In recent years, the Conservatives abandoned it. We urgently need to get it back and provide stability for the communities most affected.

Home-grown, local renewable energy and fuels can be clean, cheap and popular, and they embed resilience. The Government must work with industry because striving for theoretical perfection, rather than ambitious but deliverable policy, risks choking the sector and neutering this revolution. Our engineers and industry stand ready to deliver, as they have done time and again, the greener economy that we need and that communities up and down the country deserve.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Western. I congratulate and thank my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) on securing this timely and important debate. I pay tribute to him for his work in standing up for workers, not just at Prax Lindsey but across his constituency and his region—his energy estuary. I also thank the Father of the House, my right hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh) for his wise words. We can support all energies; it is not an either/or. We must not run down the oil, gas and liquid fuel sector just for the want of achieving a target.

In 2025 alone, we have lost two of the UK’s six remaining refineries, with thousands of well-paid workers losing their jobs in the supply chain. Grangemouth and Prax Lindsey have closed, but not because we need any less petrol, diesel, jet fuel or heating oil—just as we will not need any less ethylene after the Mossmorran plant closed in Fife, or any less oil and gas when this Government wilfully shut down the North sea, destroying jobs in communities such as mine in Aberdeenshire.

As the Minister knows, we will simply become more dependent on foreign imports, lose billions of pounds in tax receipts that could support our public services, and destroy hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs in parts of the country that need them the most. We will, as the Minister also knows, strangle our domestic production and then import more products from countries with far higher emissions. We will offshore our carbon, offshore our jobs and offshore our security, all so that the Secretary of State can boast of global leadership at COP. No one is going to want to follow our lead if we make ourselves poorer and less secure. We will become a warning, not an example, to the rest of the world. It is ideology over national interest. As Labour’s friends in the unions say, it amounts to exporting jobs in order to import virtue.

The production at Prax Lindsey will now be replaced by imports from other countries. Ineos will retain its ethylene and propylene production at Grangemouth, but will now import ethane on huge diesel-chugging container ships from across the Atlantic. Perhaps the Minister would like to explain how that is going to reduce global carbon emissions.

Rian Chad Whitton has produced a fantastic report for the Prosperity Institute in which he explains in detail how high energy costs and carbon taxes are crippling heavy industry in the UK, but particularly our refineries. We spend a lot of time in this House talking about electricity—as we should, because our electricity prices are the highest in the world, and this Government are locking us and our constituents into higher prices for longer in the upcoming allocation round 7 auction—but what we often miss in our debates is that only a small proportion of our current energy consumption is from electricity. The vast majority of it comes from other fuels such as natural gas, and that is particularly true for our heavy industry and refining sector.

When refineries use natural gas to produce their products, they are subject to a carbon tax on every unit of CO2 they release. Refineries have no choice but to use natural gas, because no other fuel can do the job that natural gas does in their processes. Many other countries charge a much lower carbon tax, or—when it comes to our competitors for refined products, such as in the US, India or the Gulf—charge no carbon tax at all. The carbon tax imposed on our industry through the emissions trading scheme makes it significantly harder for refineries to do business in the UK, increases costs for consumers and makes our industry less competitive.

Hon. Members do not have to take my word for it; they can listen to the UK chair of ExxonMobil, which runs the Fawley refinery in Southampton. At the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee recently, he said:

“the majority of…petrol and diesel imported into this country, is produced in the US, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and India…They have lower energy costs, lower labour costs and zero CO2 costs…Fawley refinery this year will spend between £70 million and £80 million on CO2 costs alone. In the next four or five years that will increase to £150 million. You tell me of another industry where you can afford to have a £150 million cost burden on a single producing unit and expect it to remain competitive for the long term. It is an absolute catastrophe waiting to happen”.

In his report for the Prosperity Institute, Rian calculates that at Prax Lindsey, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Immingham, the cost of the carbon tax alone amounted to 120% of the operating profit. How on earth can any refinery survive in that environment?

Things would be bad enough, but Ministers are not intent on making them even worse. Their decision to align the UK carbon tax with the EU’s more expensive one has increased the price that our industry pays by about 70% in the space of just a year. Why are they doing this? Ministers talk about EU alignment as if it is inevitable, but it is not. They control the market. They choose how many allowances they release. They could choose not to align with the EU and keep control of our own carbon market.

Increasing the carbon tax is a political choice that is already causing production costs to soar at refineries in Pembroke, Fawley, Stanlow and the Humber, and that has increased the cost of everybody’s electricity bill, too. Labour Members should know that electricity bills have increased by £2 billion this year alone because of the Government’s choice of alignment. The carbon tax is charged on gas-fired power generation too, and it is passed straight through to our constituents in wholesale electricity prices. That is exactly why the Conservatives have said that we will axe the carbon tax as part of our cheap power plan, to cut everybody’s electricity bills instantly by 20%.

The soaring carbon tax is crippling the refining sector. Will the Minister explain how refineries are supposed to survive when the Government are planning to increase the carbon tax between now and 2050? Is it the Government’s plan to have a carbon tax of £147 a tonne in 2030, as set out in the National Energy System Operator report? If not, will she disown her party’s claim that the NESO report shows that the clean power 2030 plan is achievable? Will the Government scrap their plan to align with the EU carbon tax scheme, which would lock us into ever higher carbon prices with no control? Will the Minister commit to increasing the number of free allowances given to the refining sector to shield it from at least some of the burden?

Refining is viable only when the raw product to refine is abundant and cheap. We cannot run a refinery on warm words about net zero and promises of green jobs that never materialise. We need crude oil and natural gas, so let us consider what is happening to the domestic oil and gas sector under this Government. Production is down, and falling at an accelerating rate; the cessation of production and decommissioning is being brought forward; investment is going overseas; 1,000 jobs a month are being lost from producers, operators and the supply chain, and no exploration wells were drilled in the UK North sea last year, for the first time since the 1960s. Why is this happening? Because the Government have banned new licences and continue—choose to continue—to keep the energy profits levy and tax UK oil and gas production at a higher rate than any other comparable basin. How can UK companies possibly compete when paying tax at 78%? There are no longer windfall prices or windfall profits, so why are companies still having to pay windfall taxes?

The Government’s short-term and idealistic policies on the North sea have an impact everywhere: they impact jobs, livelihoods, households, businesses and industries across the country. Does the Minister understand the anger and frustration in communities like mine in Gordon and Buchan, and throughout the energy sector, at the Prime Minister’s words about the EPL last week? People are losing their livelihoods and their ability to support their families because of the Government’s political choice to shut down the oil and gas sector. To hear that the Prime Minister does not even understand the policy that he is imposing, which is causing so much harm, is a complete slap in the face for energy communities across the country. Can the Minister confirm for the record that the Prime Minister was wrong to say that the windfall tax kicks in when there are excessive profits? Will she confirm that there is no longer any windfall left to tax?

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Western. I have really enjoyed the debate, which has been full of passion and emotion. I heard the anger, including in what my hon. Friend the Member for Alloa and Grangemouth (Brian Leishman) said, but I also heard that there is a lot of commonality in some of our values and on the transition that we are trying to achieve together. I have genuinely enjoyed listening and I have noted lots of points. There were a lot of questions; I will endeavour to get through them, but if I do not, we may need to follow up in writing to hon. Members.

I thank the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) for securing this important debate, and I am grateful to all hon. Members for their contributions. This is a timely opportunity to discuss a matter of strategic significance for our nation’s energy security: the future of the UK refining sector. The industry has helped to underpin our economy and our resilience for decades, and its future deserves our full attention. The Minister for Energy is in Grangemouth today, and I will say more about that later.

Our refineries play a crucial role in ensuring a stable supply of the essential fuels that keep our transport networks running, our industries operating and consumers supplied with the energy they rely on every day. The sector is more than just a fuel; it drives growth in key sectors, supports thousands of skilled jobs in communities and sustains supply chains for chemicals, plastics and manufacturing. Refineries also play a critical role in the wider downstream oil sector. The Humber refinery in the constituency of the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham is the UK’s only source of anode-grade petroleum coke, which is essential for electrical vehicle production. The Fawley refinery contributed to the global covid-19 response by supplying the specialist halobutyl rubber used to seal vaccine vials.

Importantly, UK refineries are also investing in their own future through decarbonisation and diversification by deploying carbon capture or producing low-carbon fuels to support our transition to net zero. Demand for refined products will continue, even beyond 2050, and the UK’s refineries will remain essential for hard-to-abate sectors such as heavy industry, aviation and maritime. That is why, as my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy made clear in June, the Government are absolutely committed to securing the long-term viability of the UK’s refining sector, and, as set out in the autumn Budget, we are reviewing critical policies to address the challenges that the sector faces.

Those challenges are real. In the 1970s, the UK operated 18 refineries; today, as has been said many times during the debate, only four remain. Falling demand for traditional fuels, global competition from mega-refineries in the middle east, India and Africa, changing trade dynamics and ageing assets all put pressure on UK operations. But with challenge comes opportunity, and the Government are determined to seize the opportunities by driving innovation, supporting investment and ensuring that the refining sector continues to play a vital role in our economy and for our energy security for decades to come.

The Government have already taken significant steps to support the refining sector and the wider fuel sector, and we are committed to do more. We have driven the shift to low-carbon fuels through the renewable transport fuel obligation, and this year we went further with the sustainable aviation fuel mandate, backing cleaner fuels for aviation. The Humber refinery already produces SAF at commercial scale, while Fawley and Stanlow are among the projects backed by our advanced fuels fund, which provides grants to accelerate the next generation of transport fuels. Refineries are playing a key role in driving the UK SAF industry forward, strengthening energy security with a home-grown supply. We are also de-risking investment in SAF production through the revenue certainty mechanism. We are working with industry to cut emissions through carbon capture and low-carbon hydrogen at major clusters such as Viking and HyNet. We will set out a clear plan for industrial decarbonisation to keep the UK competitive.

I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman intervened, as I was going to come on to his points—in particular, his interesting point about the national interest. I say to him gently that I feel we are working in the national interest, but the national interest includes energy security as well as respecting the science of climate change, which is happening. As he is the Father of the House, I genuinely listened to his points, but I was a little disappointed—[Interruption.] He can laugh all he likes, but I listened to his points. He talked about the UK being responsible for less than 1% of emissions. That is the case in terms of nation states, but I think the UK’s impact in the world is so much larger, whether through people following our policy decisions, the impact of our banking sector or our consumption of goods, which has also come up a lot.

We are looking at how we manage the transition, and we want to do it in a way that respects the science, but I am also competitive about where Britain can take advantage of these industries. We want to make sure that we have these industries, including the wind turbines that the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, but we also want to look at how we can make the transition justly and fairly. I will come on to that later in my speech.

Last month, the UK ETS Authority confirmed that current benchmarks will stay in place for the 2027 scheme. That decision gives refineries and other energy-intensive industries the certainty that they need. By maintaining those benchmarks, we are providing stability and breathing space, helping businesses plan, manage costs and prepare for future changes to the scheme.

We are also reviewing compensation for energy-intensive industries. We announced in the autumn Budget that we are assessing the feasibility of including refined products in the carbon border adjustment mechanism, so that imported goods face an equivalent carbon price and the sector’s efforts to decarbonise will not be undermined by carbon leakage. This is the refining sector’s top priority, which the Government are committed to exploring as one of several levers to support the sector’s long-term future. These measures demonstrate our commitment to supporting investment, driving innovation and ensuring that the refining sector remains competitive and resilient as we transition to a low-carbon economy.

Looking ahead, the Government are taking further steps to secure the long-term future of the UK refining sector and to ensure a just transition. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has established a dedicated team to work across Whitehall and with industry. A number of Members asked about working across Whitehall; we will continue to do that, to ensure that we maximise the impact. This will guide how we manage the transition, protect energy security and support jobs and local communities.

We will continue to engage closely with the fuel industry to identify practical measures that can strengthen the sector. That is why, in June, we convened the first ministerial—[Interruption.]",https://hansard.parliament.uk/dist/opengraph-card.png,N,,2025-12-12 06:57:02.535821

Flights to test the space-based technology with new aviation standards from and to the USA and Europe took place in late October and early November.

The US-based Boeing aircraft from United Airlines used the Iris satellite-based system to digitally connect pilots via satellites with air traffic controllers, enabling the more efficient routing of flights and reducing the fuel consumed. The Iris service and communication system ̶ developed by Viasat in partnership with ESA, ESSP (FR) as service provider and a wide industrial consortium of European and Canadian companies is fully operational in the European airspace since 2024 with more than 17,000 flights so far and counting .

Although the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for air travel, the industry has fully bounced back, and the number of flights is expected to increase by 50% before 2050. Such increase makes route optimisation a priority.

The aircraft, operated by United Airlines, forms part of Boeing’s ecoDemonstrator programme which has been running from 2012, testing different methods and technologies to make commercial flights more efficient and sustainable. The aeroplanes are used for short-term experimenting of specific technologies, one-third of which get implemented, suggesting the high impact this innovative digital communications technology can have on the current way of flying.

It said last month initial equipment for a project to demonstrate its plastics-to-SAF program had arrived. It aims to commission the pilot facility in the first quarter of 2026.

""The new facility will demonstrate the company’s proprietary process for transforming hard-to-recycle plastics into ultra-clean, low-carbon jet fuel"", Clean Planet said in a press release November 20.

It said in the statement this week announcing the new patents, ""With UK and EU SAF mandates coming into force, increasing pressure on bio-based feedstock supply chains and growing airline commitments to decarbonization, alternative circular feedstocks such as waste plastics are gaining strategic importance"".

Under the UK's ""SAF Mandate"", SAF must comprise two percent of total UK jet fuel demand in 2025, increasing to 10 percent in 2030 and 22 percent in 2040, as announced by the Transport Department December 19, 2024.

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, fuel suppliers at each airport in member states must have at least two percent of SAF in their offered mix starting 2025. That must be raised to six percent from 2030, 20 percent from 2035, 34 percent from 2040, 42 percent from 2045 and 70 percent from 2050.

The requirements apply to, as stated in the text of the regulation published October 31, 2023, an airport with ""higher than 800 000 passengers or where the freight traffic was higher than 100 000 tonnes in the previous reporting period, and which is not situated in an outermost region"".

Considered SAF by the regulation are biofuels, recycled carbon fuels and synthetic fuels.

Current SAF production falls below earlier IATA forecasts due to inadequate policy support for maximizing installed production capacities.
The ReFuelEU Aviation policy in Europe has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains.
Global SAF production capacity is expected to reach around 20 million tonnes by 2030 with project success factors applied.
Walsh emphasized that Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment and undermine efforts to scale SAF production.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production will slow sharply in 2026 as poorly designed European mandates inflate costs without accelerating supply. Willie Walsh, IATA Director General, stated December 9 in Geneva that mandates have failed to increase production needed for aviation decarbonization goals.

SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes in 2025, double the 1 million tonnes produced in 2024, but growth will decelerate to 2.4 million tonnes in 2026 according to IATA estimates released this week. The fuel represents only 0.6 percent of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, rising to 0.8 percent the following year. Current SAF production falls below earlier IATA forecasts due to inadequate policy support for maximizing installed production capacities.

Airlines paid a premium of 2.9 billion United States dollars (USD) for the limited 1.9 million tonnes of SAF available in 2025 according to IATA data. Of this amount, 1.4 billion USD reflects standard SAF price premiums over conventional fuel while the remaining 1.5 billion USD represents compliance fees passed to airlines by fuel suppliers unable to meet mandated production targets. SAF prices exceed fossil based jet fuel by a factor of two, reaching up to five times more in mandated markets.

The ReFuelEU Aviation policy in Europe has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have widened profit margins to such an extent that airlines pay up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF, all without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation. The United Kingdom (UK) SAF mandate has triggered similar price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist, said regulators must course correct to ensure long term viability of SAF production and achieve scale so that costs can come down. The failure to accelerate expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets, with several carriers committed to 10 percent SAF by 2030 now forced to reevaluate these commitments made in good faith.

Electronic SAF (e-SAF) mandates approach in the UK from 2028 and European Union (EU) from 2030, creating risk of repeating policy mistakes. The fuel faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel according to IATA analysis. Without strong production incentives rather than mandates, supply will fall short of targets while compliance costs could escalate to 29 billion euros by 2032 if targets remain unmet under the current policy framework.

IATA data shows approximately 68 percent of Power to Liquid (PtL) projects expected online by 2030 remain at the announcement stage with no commercial scale project reaching final investment decision in Europe. The only commercial scale project under construction is located in the United States where incentives are available, with capacity of approximately 20 thousand tonnes. To supply 0.6 million tonnes of e-SAF by 2030, the industry would need around 30 projects of similar capacity.

Renewable electricity represents a major cost driver for e-SAF, with estimated levelized costs relatively high in Europe compared with many other regions. IATA estimates show renewable electricity costs in Europe range from 51 to 136 USD per megawatt hour (MWh) compared to Middle East and North Africa region costs around 32 USD per MWh and China costs from 29 to 57 USD per MWh.

Global SAF production capacity is expected to reach around 20 million tonnes by 2030 with project success factors applied. North America will account for approximately 36 percent of global 2030 SAF capacity driven by targeted incentives, followed by Europe at 23 percent, South America at 15 percent, China at 13 percent and East Asia and Pacific at 12 percent. Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) refineries are likely to still dominate the market, accounting for about 95 percent of total volume.

Walsh emphasized that Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. The aviation executive noted that the recent European Commission Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) announcement represents a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. IATA analysis shows cumulative SAF investments could range from about 3 trillion USD under low yield assumptions to nearly 7 trillion USD under high yield assumptions by 2050.

The SAF premium translates into an additional 3.6 billion USD in fuel costs for the industry in 2025 at current price levels. Stock market data shows oil stocks have significantly outperformed clean energy since 2021, reflecting strong investor confidence in traditional energy while SAF faces expected returns below 5 percent with a 15 percentage point handicap compared to oil investments.

Walsh served as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of British Airways from 2005 to 2011 and CEO of International Airlines Group (IAG) from 2011 until September 2020. He became IATA’s eighth Director General in April 2021 after a 40 year career in the airline industry that began as a cadet pilot with Aer Lingus in 1979. IATA represents approximately 360 airlines comprising over 80 percent of global air traffic.",https://b843437.smushcdn.com/843437/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/logo-newsghana.png?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1,N,,2025-12-12 02:56:54.169998

Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements: This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","The Company is actively engaging with policy leaders in the U.S. and has been involved in ongoing constructive proposals regarding automotive policy, particularly involving the EV sector and FX’s new business strategy in the U.S.

The Company recently announced that it has launched the start of assembly of the first FX Super One MPV pre-production vehicles at the Company’s Hanford, CA, factory in anticipation of the first pre-production vehicle off the line ceremony planned for December 21.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (Nasdaq: FFAI) (“FF”, “Faraday Future”, or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today announced that executives from FF and FX brands recently joined numerous members of Congress and political leadership for pertinent business meetings in Washington, D.C. The meetings, attended by FX CEO Max Ma, and John Schilling, Director of PR and Government Affairs for the Company, included an open dialogue on a number of policy topics such as EV sales, tariffs, U.S. manufacturing and innovation. The Company wants to continue to work closely with the leadership in the nation’s capital in the near future to help promote the long-term prosperity of America’s high-end manufacturing sector, centered around the automotive industry and its broader ecosystem.

In 2024, FF announced its Global Automotive Industry Bridge Strategy, including the China-U.S. industrial bridge, alongside the launch of the second brand, Faraday X (FX). FX plans to bring world-class vehicle components to the U.S. for localized assembly through this approach, which enables FX to bring global industrial value, including those from China, into the U.S. in a way that aligns with U.S. priorities and national interests.

Currently, FF is proud to have a strong manufacturing footprint in the U.S., where it builds 100% of its vehicles, including the FF 91 2.0. The Company recently announced that it has launched the start of assembly of the FX Super One MPV pre-production vehicles at the Company’s facility in Hanford, CA, in anticipation of the first pre-production vehicle off the line ceremony planned for December 21.

While the FX brand will source components internationally in the early phase, FX is committed to progressively shifting to U.S.-based suppliers. This initiative will also encourage global automotive supply chain enterprises to establish manufacturing operations in the U.S., accelerating the development of the domestic NEV ecosystem. This approach not only supports the return of advanced manufacturing to America, but also safeguards U.S. consumer data, strengthens U.S. competitiveness in the global auto industry, and contributes meaningfully to restoring the country’s leadership position in the automotive sector.

“It was a constructive few days in Washington DC meeting with members of Congress, and included such pertinent topics related to our operations such as our new FX business, U.S. based manufacturing and the importance of innovation in driving the automotive industry to the next level,” said Max Ma. “I’m happy to say this open dialogue and ongoing discussions with the policy makers and political leaders in the U.S. will help us set a clear pathway for the further development of FF and the FX brand in the U.S. market.”

AUSTIN, Texas and NEW YORK, Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- T1 Energy Inc. (NYSE: TE) ( “T1,” “T1 Energy” or the “Company”) today announced the pricing of its previously announced underwritten public offerings of $140.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% convertible senior notes due 2030 (the “Convertible Notes” and such offering, the “Convertible Notes Offering”) and 28,282,830 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $4.95 per share (the “Common Stock Offering” and together, the “Offerings”). The Convertible Notes Offering was upsized from the previously announced $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes.

The Company estimates that the net proceeds from the Offerings will be approximately $264.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and T1 Energy’s estimated offering expenses. In addition, the Company has granted the underwriters of the Common Stock Offering a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 4,242,424 shares of its common stock, and the Company has granted the underwriters of the Convertible Notes Offering a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $21.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes solely to cover over-allotments.

The Common Stock Offering is expected to close on December 15, 2025 and the Convertible Notes Offering is expected to close on December 16, 2025, in each case, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The closing of each Offering is not conditioned upon the closing of the other Offering.

The Convertible Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of T1 Energy and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2026. The Convertible Notes will mature on December 1, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted.

Before September 1, 2030, holders may convert their Convertible Notes at their option only in certain circumstances. At any time from, and including, September 1, 2030 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders. T1 Energy will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at T1’s election. The initial conversion rate is 144.3001 shares of T1’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $6.93 per share of common stock and represents a conversion premium of approximately 40% above the public offering price per share of common stock in the Common Stock Offering. If a “make-whole fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture that will govern the Convertible Notes) occurs, or if the Company calls a holder’s Convertible Notes for redemption, then the Company will in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time for holders who convert their Convertible Notes in connection with that make-whole fundamental change, or who convert their Convertible Notes that are called for such redemption.

The Convertible Notes will not be redeemable prior to December 6, 2028. The Convertible Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), at T1’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after December 6, 2028 and prior to the 41st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the common stock equals or exceeds 130% of the conversion price for the Convertible Notes on (1) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date T1 sends the related redemption notice; and (2) the trading day immediately before the date T1 sends such notice.

If a “fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture that will govern the Convertible Notes) occurs, then, subject to certain exceptions, holders may require T1 to repurchase their Convertible Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.

The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the Convertible Notes Offering and the Common Stock Offering (i) to progress efforts to become compliant with applicable foreign entities of concern (FEOC) related provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by December 31, 2025, including through the repayment of certain indebtedness, (ii) for working capital, construction and advancement of infrastructure relating to the first 2.1 GW phase of our G2_Austin facility and (iii) for general corporate purposes. The closing of neither the proposed Convertible Notes Offering nor the Common Stock Offering is conditioned upon the closing of the other offering.

In the medium term, Drax said its U.S. wood pellet business is “well underpinned by sales into the U.K.” Drax’s Canadian business, primarily sells wood pellets into the Asian market, is expected to be more challenged, contributing to the company’s recent decision to close its facility in Williams Lake, British Columbia. “Against this backdrop the group does not currently expect to invest in additional capacity in the short to medium term, including the paused Longview project,” Drax said in the statement.

In the long term, Drax said it remains positive on the role of biomass in industrial decarbonization and carbon removals via its Elimini business.

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect.
Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down.","The International Air Transport Association released new estimates for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production showing that:

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million metric tons (Mt) (2.4 billion liters), double the 1 Mt produced in 2024. However, in 2026, SAF production growth is projected to slow down and reach 2.4 Mt.

SAF production in 2025 represents only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption, increasing to 0.8% the following year. At current price levels, the SAF premium translates into an additional USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs for the industry in 2025.

The estimated SAF output for 2025 of 1.9 Mt is a downward revision from IATA’s earlier forecasts due to lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities. SAF prices exceed fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to a factor of five in mandated markets.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonization of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

The negative effects of EU & U.K. SAF mandates

Mandates in the EU and U.K. have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption:

In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have widened their profit margins to such an extent that airlines pay up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF. All this comes without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation.

The U.K’.s SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden.

The cumulative impact of poorly designed policy frameworks is that airlines paid a premium of USD 2.9 billion for the limited 1.9 Mt of SAF available in 2025. Of this, USD 1.4 billion reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional fuel.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognize that its approach is not working and urgently correct course. The recent European Commission STIP announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter,” said Walsh.

The failure to accelerate the expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets. “Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10% SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” said Walsh.

Looking ahead to e-SAF mandates

With e-SAF mandates approaching in the U.K. (2028) and EU (2030), it’s essential not to repeat the policy missteps seen with SAF.

Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel. Without strong production incentives (as opposed to mandates), supply will fall short of targets. On top of that, compliance costs could escalate to EUR 29 billion by 2032 if targets aren’t met, as seems very likely with the current policy framework.

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect. Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down. Mandates have done just the opposite, and it is outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biomassmagazine/posts/web/2022/06/IATALogo_16565519756802.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 19:56:21.660854

UN Report Warns Cooling Demand Could Triple by 2050

The Global Cooling Watch 2025 developed by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) warns that heatwaves are the deadliest climate hazard, and that expanding cooling access must happen sustainably and equitably. The document, released at COP30 in Belem, Brazil, finds that global cooling capacity could rise from 22TW in 2022 to 68TW in 2050. Even with efficiency improvements and the phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), sector emissions could increase from 4.1Gt of CO₂e to 7.2Gt by mid-century. UNEP states that heat exposure is rising as populations and incomes grow in hotter regions, particularly in Africa and South Asia, where unmanaged air-conditioning adoption could strain grids and trigger power outages.

Microsoft, Powertrust to Support 270 MW of Distributed Solar

Powertrust, a Vancouver-based clean energy financing and aggregation platform, announced a new agreement with Microsoft to support the deployment of 270 MW of distributed solar projects in Mexico and Brazil over the next four years. Under the agreement, Microsoft will purchase RECs generated by Powertrust-supported solar installations in both countries.

ALTA Warns Zero SAF Production Threatens Regional Aviation

According to new data from theLatin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA), the region produces no Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and has no active development projects. The lack of regional SAF production could raise operating costs by US$318 billion, with airlines warning that the financial burden threatens connectivity, competitiveness, and long-term compliance with global emissions targets. The study finds that Mexico—Latin America’s second-largest aviation fuel consumer and home to one of the world’s youngest fleets—has limited prospects for SAF production. By 2050, when the aviation sector must reach net-zero emissions, Mexico is expected to produce only 3% of the region’s SAF.

Singapore’s move to create a central procurement and funding system for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is positioning the city-state as a regional and possibly global anchor for the emerging green jet fuel market.

“For Singapore to embark on this journey in a more structured manner, they needed to set up a mechanism to collect funding, send clear market signals, address demand and supply, create the ecosystem, and kickstart the market,” Jean Nie Ho, a partner and head of the environment, sustainability and governance practice at Dentons Rodyk & Davidson LLP, told Singapore Business Review.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) bill—passed this year—imposes a fixed sustainable aviation fuel levy on all departing flights starting in 2026. The proceeds collected by the agency will form a fund to procure, manage, and distribute the fuel.

This supports Singapore’s plan to cut aviation emissions from airport operations by 20% from the 2019 level of 404,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030, and reach net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.

S. Sivanesan, a senior partner at law firm Dentons Rodyk & Davidson, noted that Singapore is already amongst the world’s major oil refining centres, which could encourage more companies to explore SAF-related operations in the city-state.

Several industry players have made significant investments. Finnish refiner Neste Corp. operates a major facility in Singapore with an annual capacity of 2.6 million tonnes of renewable products, including SAF, following its 2023 expansion.

Aether Fuels Pte. Ltd. and Aster Biofuels Pte. Ltd. are developing Project Beacon on Pulau Bukom, with construction planned for 2026 and commercial operations targeted for 2028.

The Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint released in 2024 details a 1% sustainable aviation fuel use target beginning in 2026, with plans to raise this to 3% to 5% by 2030. Ho said SAF adoption is straightforward since it only requires blending into existing jet fuel systems, with no major infrastructure change needed at airports.

Because the SAF levy will be incorporated into airfares, Sivanesan said airlines should assess how ticket prices across different classes would be affected, adding that carriers might need to soften the impact on travelers.

Still, industry examples suggest that passenger traffic need not suffer. Jonathan Yap, director for dispute resolution at law firm Drew & Napier LLC, said experiences in the EU and UK—where a 2% SAF mandate is in place—show that air travel demand remains intact.

“Heathrow offers a useful case study,” he said in an emailed reply to questions. “It is one of the leading airports in SAF adoption and accounted for 17% of global sustainable jet fuel consumption in 2024. In the same year, Heathrow’s passenger numbers reached a new peak.”

Heathrow uses an incentive programme that lets airlines uplift SAF at the airport to bid for rebates that lower their SAF costs. These are funded through existing aeronautical charges.

Under Singapore’s model, its aviation authority will set up Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel and manage its environmental attributes, ensuring accountability, quality control, and accurate tracking.

Carter, Sr. (D-LA), alongside Representatives Sharice Davids (D-KS), Mike Flood (R-NE), and Tracey Mann (R-KS), introduced the Securing America’s Fuels (SAF) Act, bipartisan legislation designed to strengthen the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry, increase demand for American agricultural products, and reduce emissions in the transportation sector.

“Without coordinated action between government and industry, greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase as more people and goods fly through our skies,” said Rep. Carter. “Sustainable aviation fuel is an exciting, new green fuel that’s creating jobs in Louisiana and driving demand for American agricultural products. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to ensure America is on track to meet the growing demand for cleaner transportation and healthier communities.”

The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry currently relies on the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit to make production economically viable. While recent legislation extended the credit for all clean fuels, it eliminated the SAF-specific bonus.

“Investing in sustainable aviation fuel isn’t just good for the environment — it’s good for Kansas farmers, our communities, and our economy,” said Rep. Davids. “The SAF Act ensures that clean fuel production incentives are strong and long-term so businesses, farmers, and innovators can plan for the future with confidence. The bipartisan support shows the incredible potential we have to build a healthier, stronger, and more prosperous future for generations to come.”

“America is on the cusp of the next great biofuels revolution,” said Rep. Flood. “The Securing America’s Fuels Act is yet another way Congress can grow our bio economy and encourage innovation that creates great jobs across rural America. Sustainable aviation fuel will help lower emissions while expanding domestic markets for our nation’s farmers, ensuring that our ag economy thrives for generations to come. I want to thank Congresswoman Davids for introducing this much-needed bill and look forward to working together to advance this commonsense, bipartisan bill through Congress.”

“Sustainable aviation fuel is a worthwhile investment for American agriculture and for American energy dominance,” said Rep. Mann. “The Securing America’s Fuels Act gives Kansas farmers the certainty they need to plan, invest, and keep supplying fuel to the country and our aviation sector. I will always support legislation that supports rural communities and helps the United States continue to lead the world in producing the fuels of tomorrow.”

The SAF Act is endorsed by National Corn Growers Association, SAF Coalition, Greater New Orleans Inc., Louisiana Farm Bureau Foundation, Airlines for America, Kansas Farm Bureau, Renew Kansas, Kansas Corn, Kansas Soybean Association, Nebraska Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Soybean Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau, Twelve, Darling Ingredients, Advanced Biofuels Association, Global Business Travel Association, and American Sugar Cane League.

“It is crucial that Congress finds ways to support farmers with good domestic policy, at this time when international trade negotiations have left farmers in difficult market conditions,” said Richard Fotenot, President, Louisiana Farm Bureau. “Congressional policy changes can also provide relief to American consumers. The SAF Act does both. It creates consistency in domestic aviation fuel markets in a sustainable manner important to consumers. We are grateful to Congressman Carter and his colleagues for continuing to find ways to support these efforts through ideas like the SAF Act.”

“The SAF Coalition applauds Reps. Sharice Davids and Mike Flood for their leadership in introducing The Securing America’s Fuels Act,” said Alison Graab, Executive Director, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Coalition. “This legislation continues the broad, bipartisan support for SAF in Congress and recognizes SAF’s unique ability to fuel America’s energy dominance while supporting American farmers. The SAF Coalition urges Congress to pass this legislation so we can grow America’s rural economies, create new markets for our farmers and secure a stronger energy future for our nation.”

“SAF may offer a great opportunity for sugarcane farmers,” said Jack Pettus, VP of Government Relations, American Sugar Cane League. “Our mills use bagasse, the fibrous byproduct of recovering sugar from the sugarcane plant, to power their operations during harvest season. Our farmers have been growing and delivering this renewable fuel for over a century and we are anxious to find new uses for the excess biofuel (bagasse) that we currently produce. The American Sugar Cane League appreciates this bipartisan effort to identify and encourage demand for domestic renewable energy feedstocks in markets like aviation fuels.”

“Delta applauds Reps. Flood, Davids, Mann, and Carter for their leadership in introducing the Securing America's Fuels Act, which will ensure 45Z reaches its full potential and provides the critical investment certainty necessary to bring additional SAF production facilities online to meet our industry's unprecedented demand for cost-competitive, homegrown fuels,"" said Cherie Wilson, Vice President, Government Affairs - Sustainability, Delta Air Lines.

“U.S. airlines are grateful to Representatives Flood, Davids, Carter, and Mann for introducing legislation that would restore and extend the full 45Z tax credit,” said Airlines for America. “This will stimulate private sector investment in SAF while also bolstering American energy dominance. This credit is a win-win for both the aviation and agriculture industries, supporting U.S. job growth across the country.”

Background:

TheSAF Act would:

Reinstate the SAF bonus credit eliminated under the recent federal budget, allowing qualifying SAF producers to receive up to $0.35 or $1.75 per gallon.

Extend the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit for all clean fuels through 2033, providing long-term stability for the growing clean fuels industry.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a game-changer for local communities, agriculture, and the transportation industry. Scaling SAF to meet U.S. goals could(link is external) generate 33,000 construction jobs over five years, sustain 4,500 permanent operations jobs, and support 60,000 jobs in agriculture and logistics by 2030. SAF can also reduce(link is external) lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent, delivering major environmental benefits while using existing aviation infrastructure.

SAF is already being produced at several Louisiana facilities, positioning the state to lead in the growing clean-fuels economy while leveraging its existing industrial skilled workforce and port infrastructure. It also helps diversify Louisiana’s energy industry while creating new jobs, attracting investment, and strengthening long-term economic resilience.

In June, Reps. Carter and Flood introduced the bipartisan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Information Act. This bill directs the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) to include Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on its weekly and monthly reports, consistent with other fuel types that the agency regularly tracks.

Stronger markets, jobs and energy leadership At Darling Ingredients, we’ve proven SAF can succeed.
Ensure America leads in sustainable aviation fuel production.
And now it’s time to lead a new industry – sustainable aviation fuel.","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is an American innovation with the power to transform aviation and agriculture while strengthening rural economies. Today, more than 500 million gallons of SAF production capacity exist in the U.S., creating durable markets for crops and rendered products and supporting high-quality jobs in feedstock-rich states. But for SAF to reach its full potential, federal policy must provide the right foundation for long-term investment.

What’s holding back growth?

SAF requires advanced technology and significant upfront investment. While recent legislation extended the Section 45Z tax credit for SAF, the lower base value introduced makes new projects harder to finance. Without restoring the original incentive level, the U.S. risks slowing progress just as global demand for SAF is accelerating.

Restoring and extending SAF incentives

To address this, the Securing America’s Fuels (SAF) Act has been introduced in the U.S. House by Representatives Mike Flood, Sharice Davids, Troy Carter and Tracey Mann. This bipartisan legislation proposes two key changes to the existing tax credit framework:

Restore the SAF base credit to $1.75 per gallon under Section 45Z for qualified facilities.

Extend the 45Z credit through 2033, providing long-term certainty for investors and producers.

These measures would encourage new SAF investment and help the U.S. maintain its global energy leadership.

Stronger markets, jobs and energy leadership

At Darling Ingredients, we’ve proven SAF can succeed. Our joint venture, Diamond Green Diesel, is the largest SAF producer in North America and thrives across diverse market conditions. But for SAF to grow from a company success story to an industry success story, higher incentives are essential.

Our vision goes beyond our success — we want to see U.S. agriculture, biorefiners, airlines and rural communities thrive. A vibrant SAF industry benefits everyone, and Darling Ingredients will succeed within that ecosystem.

Restoring the full credit will:

Create new markets for U.S. farmers and biorefiners.

Support rural communities with high-quality jobs.

Ensure America leads in sustainable aviation fuel production.

Building a future together

America has always led the way. And now it’s time to lead a new industry – sustainable aviation fuel. This is about jobs, innovation and securing our energy future. If we’re not at the table, others will write the rules. We’re ready to show what America can deliver – and smart policy will make it happen.",https://darl-p-001.sitecorecontenthub.cloud/api/public/content/a4a98b9bf4b54bfba12f006bae20e4f7?v=05e515a9,N,,2025-12-11 16:56:45.391115

Commercial aviation is undergoing rapid transformation as airlines try to differentiate themselves in a highly competitive post-pandemic market. Passenger experience is no longer defined by seat comfort or onboard service alone. Today’s leading carriers are rethinking the end-to-end journey using technology, data, sustainability initiatives, and modern payment capabilities.

Below are five strategic trends every airline operator, aviation executive, and travel-tech provider should be evaluating right now.

Data-Driven Personalization at Scale

Personalization has evolved from a nice-to-have consumer perk into a core commercial priority. Airlines are using AI, predictive analytics, and advanced CRM systems to deliver more relevant offers, smarter ancillary upsells, and higher booking conversions.

This includes personalized upgrade suggestions, targeted promotions through mobile apps, and loyalty-based recommendations. Forward-thinking carriers are seeing improvements in repeat bookings and customer lifetime value.

The real competitive advantage will come from connecting passenger data across booking platforms, loyalty programs, and digital touchpoints rather than operating isolated systems.

Biometric Identity and Frictionless Airport Processing

Airport congestion continues to impact scheduling, customer satisfaction, and overall operational efficiency. Biometric boarding and digital identity verification are streamlining airport touchpoints, reducing manual processes, and accelerating passenger flow.

Facial recognition systems and automated identity checks are improving security while reducing wait times across check-in, security screening, and boarding.

As biometric adoption expands, airlines and airports will prioritize global interoperability, data privacy compliance, and integration with existing infrastructure.

In-Flight Connectivity as a Business Requirement

Reliable in-flight Wi-Fi is quickly shifting from a premium option to an operational necessity. The business value now goes far beyond entertainment.

High-speed connectivity enables business travelers to stay productive, supports real-time operations, and creates opportunities for digital commerce, advertising, and customer engagement.

Airlines equipped with dependable connectivity are better positioned to meet the needs of corporate travelers, digital nomads, and international passengers who expect seamless online access.

Sustainability and the Transition Toward Responsible Aviation

Environmental responsibility has become a key purchasing factor for both leisure travelers and corporate travel buyers who must meet ESG commitments.

Investments in sustainable aviation fuel, lighter components, carbon-offset programs, and future electric propulsion are increasingly tied to long-term competitiveness.

Regulatory pressure and global climate expectations will continue pushing airlines toward sustainable operations, and the carriers that show measurable progress will strengthen their brand reputation and corporate partnerships.

Modernized Payment Infrastructure and Digital Wallet Adoption

Flexible payment options are now directly linked to stronger conversion rates and international reach. Airlines are expanding payment acceptance through secure global airline payment processing, enabling digital wallets, regional payment methods, alternative credit options, and buy-now-pay-later solutions.

This shift is especially important in international markets where traditional credit card penetration may be limited. By modernizing their payment infrastructure, airlines can increase cross-border bookings, reduce friction at checkout, and unlock incremental revenue opportunities.

Strategic Outlook

The airlines that succeed over the next decade will be those that treat passenger experience as a commercial growth engine rather than a service feature. Personalization, biometrics, connectivity, sustainability, and modern payment systems are no longer side projects — they represent foundational elements of future competitiveness.

Leaders should focus investments on platforms that improve revenue performance, operational efficiency, global expansion, and digital scalability.

Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech, explained that the initiative aims to transform waste industrial gases in Oman into ethanol, which can subsequently be refined into sustainable aviation fuel. This fuel enables airplanes to operate using recycled carbon rather than traditional fossil fuels.

Holmgren stated, “I recently had the privilege of signing a landmark agreement that sets a bold new course for aviation and climate action in Oman. Oman is rapidly becoming a leader in the circular carbon economy by demonstrating how industrial expertise and progressive policies can convert waste carbon into valuable products. In the GCC region, countries like Oman and Saudi Arabia are leading the way toward a future where carbon is continuously recycled and reused, opening new opportunities for circular carbon to become a reality.”

Currently, the project is in its initial phase, with LanzaTech and the IFC collaboratively conducting a comprehensive feasibility study. This includes detailed evaluations of feedstock and product markets, capital expenditure projections, and financial modelling, all aimed at establishing a clear path to final investment decision (FID) and project implementation.

LanzaTech, headquartered in Illinois, will provide its core technology for producing SAF in Oman. Their biorecycling process captures carbon-rich gases directly from high-emission industrial sites, preventing these gases from entering the atmosphere. The captured carbon is then converted into sustainable alternatives to fossil-based materials, which have applications spanning detergents, textile fibers, packaging, and transport fuels.

Currently, about six commercial facilities worldwide operate using LanzaTech’s technology platform. The company is building a robust value chain for recycling carbon into ethanol and subsequently into SAF. Holmgren highlighted Oman’s conducive environment, citing its potential to become a regional or even global hub for circular carbon solutions.

Holmgren emphasized the significant impact the SAF project will have on Oman, estimating an annual production capacity of 80,000 tonnes of SAF. She noted, “Projects like this support Oman Vision 2040 by fostering job creation and economic diversification.”

According to Holmgren, SAF could contribute over 60% of the aviation sector’s CO₂ reduction targets by 2050. She added, “If another 15 to 20 plants of similar scale are developed globally, annual sustainable fuel production could surpass 1.5 million tonnes—50% more than last year’s total global SAF output. This is the transformative scale the world urgently requires.”

Oman’s rich availability of diverse carbon-rich feedstocks, combined with its advanced industrial infrastructure, positions it ideally to lead in circular carbon innovation. LanzaTech noted that this project further solidifies Oman’s status as a regional pioneer in carbon circularity.

The IFC underlined the importance of this collaboration, stating, “The project aligns with Oman Vision 2040’s goals of sustainable manufacturing, economic diversification, and job creation. This initiative is a key component of the World Bank Group’s mission in Oman and marks a continuation of IFC’s expanding presence following vital agreements announced during World Bank Group Day last year.”

Budapest Airport

Chris Dinsdale has worked at Budapest Airport since 2015, originally as CFO until March 2021, where he was nominated for the position as CEO. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dinsdale, as CFO of the airport at the time, fought relentlessly to make sure that the company survived the crisis and worked with great commitment to secure the funding of the airport. For example, a voluntary salary cut for the executives and the founding of the Budapest Airport Foundation, which supports blue collar workers who lost their job during the COVID-19 pandemic.

After being nominated to CEO position in March 2021, Dinsdale continues to work closely with the executive team to create a clear COVID-19 recovery strategy for Budapest Airport. This will also mean that we come out stronger of the pandemic and have a clear focus. Dinsdale is an inspiring true leader who helped us all to cope with the very difficult times of the pandemic and I am convinced that he truly deserves this award.

CEO

Swedavia Airports

Jonas Abrahamsson has shown the strength to steer the company towards its long-term sustainable goals, despite the challenges of COVID-19. Abrahamsson has ensured that Swedavia achieved its net zero target for all ten of the airports in 2020 and has continued to support strategic development and innovation to further the cause of sustainable air travel. During 2020, when passenger numbers where down over 90 per cent and a lot of investments were paused, he decided that investments in the company’s net zero target should proceed, allowing Swedavia to become the first net zero airport group by the end of 2020.

Airport General Manager

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport

Balram Bheodari leads Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as North America’s most efficient airport, due to his vast knowledge of and astute attention to efficiency in aviation, which has allowed the airport to thrive in the most difficult of markets. Bheodari combines operational expertise, integrity, and selflessness to provide a quality of leadership throughout Atlanta Airport. He oversees all facets of airport governance, including operations and a multi-billion-dollar capital improvement programme, ATLNext, designed to pave the way for Atlanta’s growth over the next 20 years. During COVID-19, Bheodari developed a comprehensive resumption of operations playbook that served to support ATL’s recovery efforts. With guidance from the Federal Aviation Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) amid evolving health and safety guidelines, Bheodari steadfastly encouraged collaboration among stakeholders, team-building among aviation employees, and adaptability in uncertain times. Throughout the pandemic, he participated in daily calls with Airports Council International and other large-hub airports to share best practices as well as information from Washington, D.C. federal offices and the CDC.

He aimed to restore customer confidence and ensure the airport was a healthy facility using COVID-19 safe protocols. Since, the airport achieved Airport of the Year by the Airport Minority Advisory Council (AMAC).

During the height of the pandemic, Bheodari was the most ardent supporter of our mission-critical employees. Having worked his way up through the ranks, he fully appreciates the oftentimes thankless jobs these employees perform that keep the Airport safe and running optimally at all times. Morale never flagged because Bheodari made sure those employees felt valued through hazard pay, special meals, social media posts, intranet spotlight features, and other incentives.

His actions and his directives all reflect his commitment to the three key focus areas of our organisation’s strategic plan: people, purpose and performance.

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

Chief Strategy Development Officer

Bangalore International Airport Limited

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Raghunath worked closely with all the aero concessionaires and cargo operators to minimise disruption and provide financial relief to them. The airline marketing team helped launch a historic first route to the U.S. West Coast and the cargo team at BIAL also achieved record numbers over this period, with the airport becoming India’s leading airport for the export of perishables. Despite the impact of COVID-19, Raghunath has led a digital transformation and expansion at BIAL airport, with new initiatives and the deployment of the fully biometric-based self-boarding solution for seamless passenger flow and travel experiences and a process automation and analytics platform. These initiatives amongst many others, meant that the airport won ACI World’s ‘Voice of the Customer’ initiative, which recognised BIAL airports efforts to prioritise their customers during COVID-19. Raghunath has remained a staunch and resilient leader during such an uncertain time and is very much appreciated by his team.

Head of Operations, Safety and Emergency

Because this holiday season, none of us want coal in our stockings—or our clean energy carbon accounting.","Like Michael Bublé or Mariah Carey on the radio this holiday season, there’s an unavoidable hot topic circulating this month if you work in clean energy, carbon accounting or corporate sustainability: the GHG Protocol Scope 2 proposed revision. That proposal is currently open for public comment (through January 31, 2026). It’s important to understand the proposal’s implications so you may add your voice to the feedback. In particular, sustainability professionals, clean energy buyers and marketing teams need to know how the proposed requirements could leave their organizations exposed to the heightened risk of greenwashing backlash and liability.

Hourly matching may not accomplish the emissions reductions companies would be claiming

The major Market-Based Method (MBM) revision that GHGP has put forward for public comment is most commonly known as “hourly matching.” The details have been covered extensively in trade media, organization blog posts, and professional social media, so we’ll just summarize the high-level gist here. If enshrined as the new GHGP Scope 2 MBM, organizations would be allowed to count toward their Scope 2 emissions reductions only if their procured clean energy or certificates are a) produced in the same hour as the organization’s electricity demand and b) located within the same grid region as the load.

But when you look closely at the details, what the proposal does (and doesn’t) include significantly undermines the green claims it purports to improve, and experts have had big questions around the effectiveness of hourly matching. The net effect of the proposal in its current state is the very real risk of greenwashing. In particular:

Hourly matching discourages investment in impactful clean power development: First, restrictive locational and time matching requirements limit the locations where organizations will direct investment for clean energy development. As a result, organizations would likely opt to build in a cleaner region that is compliant with Scope 2 requirements instead of a more impactful region that would take the place of dirtier fuels but is outside of the “deliverable region.”

The myth of deliverability: Second, the proposed revision mandates that purchased clean energy must be “deliverable” to the organization’s electricity load, and it uses grid regions as the de facto proxy for meeting deliverability requirements. However, the Center for Resource Solutions (CRS), GHG Management Institute, Green Strategies and others point out that intra-regional transmission constraints and other factors mean that clean energy often is not deliverable to an organization’s load. It’s a myth that sounds good in theory but vanishes in practice.

No additionality requirement: Third, the current proposal also lacks any rigorous criteria for additionality in the purchased clean energy. That means that an organization could simply purchase unbundled RECs from existing renewable energy projects and apply them toward its organization’s carbon footprint. The lack of an additionality requirement removes the incentive to build and procure clean power in impactful locations.

Standard Supply Service (SSS) contribution: Fourth, the SSS criteria allow organizations to claim credits from existing clean energy sources on the public grid in a way that will reduce the amount of clean energy they need to procure on their own. With zero change to clean energy or emissions in the real world, this on-paper-only change to the math would magically boost an organization’s clean procurement and reduce its reported emissions. According to a recent WattTime analysis, the SSS provision alone could cut the emissions-reduction benefit of voluntary clean energy procurement in half.

Greenwashing is facing a moment of reckoning

The proposed hourly matching revision to GHGP Scope 2 standards would result in green claims that aren’t substantiated by data or real-world outcomes. That spells major potential greenwashing trouble—not hypothetical trouble, and not just for corporate brand reputations, but also for real legal liability.

Just last month, the United States’ largest meat companies agreed to walk back “net-zero” and “climate-smart” claims as part of settlements in response to greenwashing lawsuits. Also last month, the European Commission announced that 20 airlines would agree to change misleading climate-related claims about sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and their overall carbon footprint. And it’s not just lawmakers and environmental NGOs bringing suit against corporate green claims. Earlier this year, a company sued its competitor over alleged false environmental claims.

A moment of reckoning is here, and voluntary clean energy buyers cannot afford for the GHGP’s proposed Scope 2 revisions to saddle them with reporting guidelines that embed accounting that dangerously flirts with greenwashing.

Add your voice to the public comments

The Scope 2 revisions are not yet signed, sealed and delivered. There’s still time to make your voice heard and advocate for a better way. For example, a REsurety analysis of a hypothetical corporate clean energy buyer could implement an impact accounting strategy and achieve four times greater avoided emissions at half the cost of an hourly matching approach.

To help organizations better understand how the proposed hourly matching revision and the alternative impact accounting proposal would affect their reported net carbon emissions, REsurety and WattTime have released a free Scope 2 accounting calculator. Organizations are invited to enter their electricity consumption and clean energy purchasing details to see how their reported carbon emissions would be calculated under the two dominant proposals. And if you have strong feelings about the results, don’t forget to submit comments to the GHGP.

Because this holiday season, none of us want coal in our stockings—or our clean energy carbon accounting.

However, the championship's emissions rose by 11% compared to Season 9.

This rise, the report says, was primarily due to the transition from secondary assumptions to primary data for the business travel of each team in the championship.

Jeff Dodds, CEO of Formula E, says: “Season 10 proved once again that elite sport and sustainability are not mutually exclusive – they are mutually reinforcing.

“From using sustainable aviation fuel across continents to leaving lasting legacies in host cities through our Better Futures Fund, our purpose is clearer than ever: to accelerate sustainable human progress through the power of electric racing.

“While many treat sustainability as a destination or make commitments without true action, our strategy is to always go further, be more ambitious and continually uncover new ways of being innovative and impactful.”

The logistics of racing around the world

Formula E improved its logistics in Season 10, supported by a new global hub in Valencia, Spain, which replaced its previous logistics base at Donington Park in the UK.

The new hub’s proximity to a major port allowed Formula E to optimise its freight routes and increase its use of sustainable sea freight.

It also partnered with DHL to prioritise the use of ships powered by sustainable biofuels.

Formula E successfully completed its logistics transition by the start of Season 11 despite challenges including an unexpected flood in Valencia in October 2024.

The championship also successfully used sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to transport freight between Berlin and Shanghai using DHL’s GoGreen Plus service.

This service uses a book and claim system, with SAF used by air carriers and the emission reductions allocated to shippers as certificates.

Paul Fowler, Vice President Motorsports at DHL, says: “Our collaboration with Formula E shows what’s possible when logistics and sport work together.

“By partnering closely and rethinking freight strategies, we’ve identified practical ways to reduce emissions – optimising routes and shifting to sea and road transport –while ensuring the championship runs smoothly.""

Formula E’s benchmarks and certifications

For a second consecutive year, Formula E was awarded first position in the Global Sustainability Benchmark in Sport with a best-ever score of 85%.

It reaffirmed its environmental credentials, aligning with standards including ISO 20121, ISO 14064 and the IWA 42 framework for climate governance and emissions transparency.

Formula E also became the first sport to receive BSI’s Net Zero Pathway certification.

The Pathway provides independent assurance across an organisation's carbon inventory, targets and management controls to help ensure net zero goals are realistic and achievable.

“Sport has the opportunity to play a leading role in our transition to a sustainable world,"" explains Matt Page, Senior Vice President, Assurance Services EMEA at BSI.

“This achievement reflects a deep, long-term commitment to credible climate action and demonstrates what is possible when ambition is matched with transparency and robust governance.”

Illinois-based LanzaTech’s technology will be central to producing SAF in Oman. Its biorecycling process captures carbon-rich gases directly from energy-intensive industrial sites, preventing their release into the atmosphere. The recovered carbon is then converted into sustainable alternatives to fossil-derived materials, with applications ranging from detergents and textile fibres to packaging and transportation fuels.

At present, around six commercial plants worldwide are operating based on LanzaTech’s platform. The company says it is building a strong new value chain - recycling carbon into ethanol and then into SAF - and believes Oman has the right conditions to emerge as a regional and potentially global hub for circular carbon solutions.

According to Holmgren, the SAF project will have a “real measurable impact” for Oman. “Projects like this have the potential to produce 80,000 tonnes of SAF annually, advancing Oman Vision 2040, creating jobs, and supporting economic diversification,” she noted.

“SAF is expected to deliver over 60% of aviation’s CO₂ reductions by 2050. If just 15–20 more plants of this scale are built globally, we could see more than 1.5 million tonnes of sustainable fuel produced each year — 50% more than last year’s global SAF output. That’s the transformative scale the world needs,” the CEO remarked.

Oman’s abundant access to diverse carbon-rich feedstocks, coupled with world-class industrial infrastructure, positions the country ideally to pioneer circular carbon solutions. This initiative, the company added, reinforces Oman’s role as a regional trailblazer in carbon circularity.

Underscoring the significance of the proposed project for Oman, IFC commented: “The project is in line with the Oman Vision 2040 agenda for sustainable manufacturing, economic diversification, and job creation — an essential pillar of the World Bank Group’s mission in the country. This collaboration reflects IFC’s continued expansion in Oman following landmark agreements announced during the World Bank Group Day last year.”",https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2025/12/11/thumbs/600x600/3220418.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 12:56:40.879370

African airlines are expected to earn a net profit of $200 million in 2025, representing a 1.1 percent margin—the lowest of any region.
Profit per passenger is forecast at $1.40, a fraction of the global average of $7.90.
According to Iata, African carriers continue to face the highest operating costs in the world, with average cost per available tonne-kilometre, nearly double the global average.
Supply chain issues are slowing fleet renewals, pushing the average global aircraft age above 15 years—the oldest on record.","African carriers are heading into 2026 with profitability still stuck at the lower end of the global industry spectrum, as structural pressures that have long constrained the continent’s aviation sector show little sign of easing.

The latest financial outlook from the International Air Transport Association (Iata), released on December 9, projects another year of modest gains for African airlines despite stronger traffic growth than the global average.

The outlook, released on the sidelines of Iata Global Media Day in Geneva, highlights a widening performance gap between Africa and the rest of the world, driven by entrenched structural constraints – fragmented markets and policy frameworks as well as fuel that costs 20 percent more than elsewhere- that continue to weigh heavily on the continent’s aviation prospects.

Passenger traffic is projected to be well above the global average but profits remain elusive.

African airlines are expected to earn a net profit of $200 million in 2025, representing a 1.1 percent margin—the lowest of any region.

Profit per passenger is forecast at $1.40, a fraction of the global average of $7.90.

The outlook for 2026 shows little change; profits remain at $200 million, while margins slip slightly to 1 percent, with profit per passenger easing to $1.30.

Passenger traffic is projected to grow by 6 percent, outpacing the global forecast of 4.4 percent, but capacity is expected to rise by only 5.7 percent.

According to Iata, African carriers continue to face the highest operating costs in the world, with average cost per available tonne-kilometre, nearly double the global average.

A combination of high fuel prices, older fleets, fragmented markets, and taxes averaging 28 percent — the highest globally — continues to limit their resilience.

Demand is further restricted by visa challenges, restrictive bilateral agreements, and high passenger charges, keeping travel highly price-sensitive across much of the continent.

Net margin

Globally, airlines are projected to generate $1.008 trillion in revenue in 2025, increasing to $1.053 trillion in 2026.

Net profit for 2025 is estimated at $39.5 billion, rising slightly to $41 billion again in 2026—a record figure, though still representing a modest 3.9 percent net margin.

Iata director-general Willie Walsh noted that while stability is welcome, profitability remains thin relative to the industry’s economic importance and capital intensity.

“Airlines are expected to generate a 3.9 percent net margin and a $41 billion profit in 2026. That’s extremely welcome news considering the headwinds the industry faces,” Walsh said, pointing to supply chain bottlenecks, geopolitical volatility, rising regulatory burdens and infrastructure constraints.

Despite improved margins, the industry will still fall short of covering its cost of capital in 2026, with return on invested capital at 6.8 percent versus a weighted average cost of capital of 8.2 percent.

Air cargo continues to be a bright spot, defying earlier predictions of decline. Shipments tied to e-commerce and semiconductor manufacturing — fuelled by demand for AI-related technologies — have supported steady performance.

The sector has also benefited from early shipments ahead of US tariff deadlines, as well as re-routing of goods to new markets.

But cost pressures remain high. While fuel costs are expected to ease slightly in 2026, non-fuel expenses—including labour, maintenance, and airport charges—will continue to rise.

Supply chain issues are slowing fleet renewals, pushing the average global aircraft age above 15 years—the oldest on record.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) costs are also climbing, with incremental expenses projected to hit $4.5 billion in 2026 as airlines increase compliance with global emissions reduction schemes.

For Africa, the Iata outlook underlines a long-standing dilemma. Traffic growth is accelerating, yet profitability remains stuck at near-break-even levels.

Low GDP per capita across much of the continent limits discretionary spending, making air travel highly price sensitive and restricting its growth potential.

Without relief on costs, taxes, and market fragmentation, the region’s airlines are likely to continue operating with limited buffers even as demand expands.

The report suggests that easing visa regimes, revisiting bilateral air service restrictions, reducing fuel markups, and addressing ageing fleets could help unlock the continent’s aviation potential—transforming growth into sustainable profit.

For now, African carriers remain caught between rising passenger demand and structural inefficiencies that erode margins, leaving them more exposed to shocks than their global counterparts.",https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/resource/image/5294102/landscape_ratio3x2/1200/800/bff6365689c524ebe4e11ecb1510719e/PZ/pic-airlines.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 11:57:49.341722

Pittsburgh is the only North American market included in today’s Aer Lingus announcement, which included four additional European routes.
As part of IAG, Aer Lingus has pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to power 10 percent of its flights with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030.","With today’s announcement that Aer Lingus is introducing nonstop flights from Pittsburgh International Airport to Dublin Airport, Pittsburgh and Ireland have the opportunity to build on the powerful business and cultural connection that drives economic development in both regions.

Flights on Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, start on May 25, 2026, on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays – connecting the two cities for the first time with regular scheduled service. The route will operate year-round with a brief pause in January and February. Flights are available for booking now.

From Dublin, Aer Lingus offers connections to a number of markets, including Irish destinations such as Donegal, regional markets in the U.K. including Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh, and major European cities, including Amsterdam, Berlin, Geneva, Glasgow, Madrid, Paris, Rome, Venice and Zurich.

“Aer Lingus is particularly pleased to add Pittsburgh to our transatlantic network, having worked closely with partners in the region to make this a possibility. This route builds on our strong partnership with the Pittsburgh Steelers and further cements Aer Lingus’ position as a leading transatlantic carrier. Through its Dublin hub, Aer Lingus provides convenient connections that link Pittsburgh with over 30 destinations across Europe and the U.K.,” said Susanne Carberry, Aer Lingus Chief Customer Officer.

Officials said this announcement sends a message to the global industry about the strength of the Pittsburgh market.

“The Pittsburgh region’s connections to Ireland run deep – both in today’s strong business market and ancestral ties – and this is a route that community leaders have been seeking,” Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis said. “We are thrilled to have a partner in Aer Lingus that will serve Pittsburgh’s growing market for nonstop service to Ireland and beyond, and we look forward to welcoming even more European travelers to Pittsburgh.”

This route addition is building on long-term ties between Pittsburgh and Ireland. One of the NFL’s premier teams with followers around the globe, the Pittsburgh Steelers were selected to play the first-ever NFL regular-season game in Dublin in September 2025 in part because the Rooney family, which has owned the team since its founding in 1933, has deep connections to Ireland. The Rooneys trace their ancestry to Newry in Northern Ireland and the late Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney Sr. co-founded The Ireland Funds, a philanthropic organization promoting peace and reconciliation, and served as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland from 2009 to 2012.

“The Pittsburgh Steelers and Rooney family, with strong ties to Ireland, are thrilled by today’s announcement that Aer Lingus, an Official Airline of the Pittsburgh Steelers, will launch nonstop service between Pittsburgh and Dublin. This announcement builds off deep connections between these two regions and will help to drive economic growth, investment, and vitality in both markets. We applaud the partnership, with Christina Cassotis at the helm, that came together to secure this economic win for our region,” said Dan Rooney, Vice President of Business Development and Strategy, Pittsburgh Steelers.

The Steelers game in Dublin this September bolstered and highlighted the relationship between the regions, but the roots go much deeper. Several major Pittsburgh-based companies have operations in Ireland, including:

UPMC: The $30 billion health care provider and insurer is the single largest nongovernmental employer in Pennsylvania, with about 100,000 employees. It operates hundreds of locations in the U.S. and in places around the globe, including Italy, Croatia and Ireland. UPMC operates four hospitals in Ireland — the Sports Surgery Clinic, UPMC Whitfield, UPMC Kildare and UPMC Aut Even — two Hillman Cancer Centers, a network of sports medicine clinics, several outpatient facilities and its Global Technology Operations Center.

PPG Industries: The global leader in paints, coatings and specialty materials is the second-largest coatings company in the world by revenue and operates in more than 70 countries across six continents, including Ireland, China and Germany.

BNY: The oldest continuously operating bank in the U.S. and the world’s largest global custodian bank was founded in 1784. It has operations in 35 countries, including Ireland, Germany, France and Italy.

MSA Safety: The worldwide safety company holds leading market positions in critical safety segments, such as self-contained breathing apparatuses. It has locations across the globe, including Ireland, Germany, Brazil and India.

Eaton: The intelligent power management company provides energy-efficient solutions designed to help customers effectively manage electrical, hydraulic and mechanical power. Its global corporate headquarters is in Dublin with the Pittsburgh area serving as a hub for its electrical business. Eaton has a presence in 44 countries, including Germany, France, Brazil and India.

Others are recognizing the economic development potential.

Martin O’Brien, chief executive of the Louth & Meath Education and Training Board in Dundalk, Ireland, struck a partnership with the Ireland Institute of Pittsburgh and Catalyst Connection, a Pittsburgh economic development nonprofit that assists small manufacturing firms. In 2022, O’Brien spent three days touring Pittsburgh-area companies and research hubs, including Neighborhood 91, a center for 3D printing and additive manufacturing at the Pittsburgh International Airport campus. Catalyst Connections and Ireland’s Southern Regional College also announced an apprenticeship exchange program in September 2025.

The nonprofit Ireland Institute connects Pittsburgh and Irish companies through the Pittsburgh Irish Business Network to explore trade and investment opportunities. James Lamb, president of the Ireland Institute of Pittsburgh, is the city’s honorary consul of Ireland, responsible for facilitating business opportunities and cultural exchange.

“As someone with deep and personal ties to Ireland, I have a strong understanding of the importance of Pennsylvania’s rich history of Irish heritage. Our commonwealth was built on the contributions of our Irish ancestors and those who continue to carry their legacies, values and traditions. Just last year, I led the successful effort to create an Ireland Trade Commission to foster stronger ties between Pennsylvania and Ireland, and now with this nonstop service from Aer Lingus, that mission has become that much easier to accomplish,” said Pennsylvania State Senator Devlin Robinson.

Before the Steelers took to the field in Dublin, a contingent of Pittsburgh business and government leaders, including Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. Austin Davis, state Department of Community and Economic Development Secretary Rick Siger, Allegheny Conference CEO Stefani Pashman and Rooney, promoted the opportunities for new investment in Pittsburgh.

They were joined by representatives from Pittsburgh International Airport, the Allegheny Conference, Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, and VisitPittsburgh to pitch Pittsburgh’s strengths in sectors ranging from healthcare and life sciences to manufacturing and technology to potential partners.

“We’re thrilled to welcome this new international route, which further strengthens Pittsburgh’s global connectivity and underscores the incredible momentum across our region. Pittsburgh is a city forging ahead—with major investments, a growing innovation economy, and a vibrant cultural scene that continues to draw visitors from around the world. This flight makes it easier than ever for international travelers to experience everything that makes Pittsburgh a must-see destination. We look forward to partnering with Pittsburgh International Airport and our new airline partners at Aer Lingus to ensure this route thrives for years to come.” Said Jerad Bachar, CEO and president of VisitPittsburgh.

Those business connections will be enhanced by Aer Lingus, which the international air transport rating organization Skytrax has awarded four stars. Aer Lingus’ nonstop service between PIT and Dublin is expected to create an economic impact of approximately $23 million per year supporting 156 jobs, according to a model by EDRG.

Pittsburgh is the only North American market included in today’s Aer Lingus announcement, which included four additional European routes. Pittsburgh now features three trans-Atlantic routes (along with London and Reykjavik). This route becomes the 63rd non-stop destination from PIT and increases the airport’s number of airlines to 16.

The flights to Dublin on Airbus A321LR aircraft will depart from Pittsburgh at 8:40 p.m. and arrive in Dublin at 8:40 a.m. The flight back will depart from Dublin at 4:10 p.m. and arrive in Pittsburgh at 7:10 p.m. Travelers on flights from Dublin arrive at PIT pre-cleared, meaning they have completed their immigration and customs inspections before boarding their flight. This allows travelers to proceed directly to the baggage claim or terminal exit after arriving without the need to clear customs at PIT, providing a smoother travel experience.

The airline is a member of International Airlines Group (IAG), the corporate parent for British Airways. As part of IAG, Aer Lingus has pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to power 10 percent of its flights with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030.

That aligns with PIT’s industry-leading initiative to produce SAF on its campus in partnership with Avina Synthetic Aviation Fuel. The facility is expected to produce over 100 million gallons of SAF annually. It could be operational by 2028, making PIT the first on-airport SAF facility in the U.S. to provide fuel for aircraft using the airport.

That would be the latest in PIT’s energy innovations, which include its first-of-its-kind microgrid, powered by natural gas and a solar farm. The microgrid enables the airport to be resilient against power outages that can compromise safety and disrupt the industry, while saving in utility costs.",https://blueskypit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Aer_Lingus-A321LR_AirToAir-1-ref132234-BSN.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 10:56:09.978737

These milestones reflect Delta’s ongoing commitment to transforming the future of flight and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, and were instrumental in driving cost savings for the company.

Check out the progress Delta made toward its decarbonization goals this year:

WHAT WE FLY

Partnering with revolutionary tech players to advance more fuel-efficient aircraft

Delta announced a new partnership with JetZero to accelerate the development of JetZero’s blended wing-body (BWB) aircraft, a design that is expected to be up to 50% more fuel efficient than aircraft in operation today.

Delta is providing its best-in-class operational expertise through its Sustainable Skies Lab to bring the BWB aircraft to commercial viability as part of the global carrier’s work toward net-zero emissions by 2050. Delta will also consult on the interior design to re-invent and further elevate both customer and employee experiences.

Delta’s revolutionary fleet portfolio continued to grow in 2025. Delta also announced a new partnership with Maeve Aerospace to advance the development of Maeve’s hybrid electric aircraft for regional flights. Compared to today's regional aircraft designs, Maeve's aircraft design aims to reduce fuel consumption and emissions by up to 40%' + drupalSettings.data.extlink.extLabel + ' using conventional jet fuel, with further lifecycle emissions reductions possible when using SAF.

Maeve joins Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab as the fifth revolutionary fleet partner, advancing a key milestone in Delta’s 2023 Sustainability Roadmap to accelerate innovative solutions for a more sustainable future of travel.

As a regional, hybrid-electric solution, Maeve’s exclusive partnership with Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab rounds out Delta’s portfolio of revolutionary fleet partners across short, medium and long-haul markets. Other revolutionary fleet partners include JetZero with its blended wing body mainline aircraft; Joby with their home-to-airport air offering; and Airbus and Boeing, both of which are exploring next generation technology.

Next-generation fleet technology

While Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab continues to look toward the future by pursuing partnerships and investments to support revolutionary technologies – such as with JetZero, Maeve, and Joby – Delta also continues its fleet renewal program by investing in state-of-the-art aircraft that provide safe, reliable and premium customer experience while delivering superior fuel efficiency. In 2025, Delta is on track to take delivery of more than 35 aircraft that are on average more than 25% more fuel efficient per seat mile than the aircraft retired since 2019.

HOW WE FLY

Achieving a major fuel savings milestone with Carbon Council

In 2025, Delta met and exceeded its near-term (2025) fuel savings goal of one percent fuel burn savings, by delivering over 55 million gallons* of jet fuel savings from operational improvements.

The airline was able to achieve and surpass this goal in the first quarter of 2025, thanks to Delta’s cross-enterprise Carbon Council that works with operating divisions and critical teams to implement flight metrics and actions that reduce jet fuel consumption, including Delta’s airport customer service teams, Flight Operations and Technical Operations teams. This achievement of 55 million gallons of jet fuel savings is worth more than $125M in annual cost savings for the global carrier. Reducing fuel consumption was accomplished in several ways, including:

Reducing weight on board

Introducing technology to track and reduce Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) usage between flights, empowering pilots, airport customer service agents, and Delta aircraft maintenance technicians to contribute to cost, fuel, and emissions savings

Optimizing aircraft speed and routing

Certifying new landing procedures

Adding drag reduction technology – like winglets – to existing fleet

Delta is also working to embed a sustainability mindset throughout the business with operational fuel-efficiency KPIs to engage employees, unify efforts and empower teams to drive impact toward Delta’s sustainability goals. Earlier this year, Delta launched a new program, Green Station of the Year, to activate more than 65% of Delta people who can help achieve fuel savings in their daily work. These frontline team members directly contribute to operational KPIs, which show the power of Delta people through friendly competition that drives fuel savings through APU reduction.

*Compared to 2019, and relative to what we would have used if Delta had not undertaken any fuel efficiency efforts, not including fleet renewal.

More sustainable travel experiences

Sustainability on board and on the ground matters, too. This year, Delta officially rolled out new paper cups across its entire operation. Years ago, Delta began the journey to reduce single-use plastics in flight to deliver a more premium customer experience. One major step toward that goal was finding a more sustainable alternative to plastic cups. In 2023, Delta began final testing of these new cups on transcontinental domestic flights. After completing testing in 2024, teams across Delta worked through inventory, supply chain and logistics to make the transition.

Additionally, Delta opened the new Delta One Lounge and a second Delta Sky Club at Seattle-Tacoma International, the entirety of both created with sustainability in mind with features like smart windows that adjust to sunlight, all-electric energy with motion-sensing lights and reusable dinnerware to reduce waste. These thoughtful touches help lower energy consumption while fostering a comfortable and elevated atmosphere.

Finally, Delta continues to support regional flight innovation with a new partnership with Green Taxi Aerospace to explore electric taxiing technology that aims to reduce fuel use, operating costs, taxi time, and carbon emissions. Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab is contributing decades of operating experience to help Green Taxi optimize its electric taxing system at airports for regional aircraft, though their long-term vision extends is to offer this technology for larger aircraft as well.

Deepening Airbus and Delta's partnership

Delta continues to deepen its relationship with Airbus, positioning the world’s leading aircraft manufacturer and its largest operator at the forefront of advancing next generation aviation technologies to revolutionize the future of flying. Earlier this year at CES, Delta announced a number of initiatives with Airbus, including working with Airbus to test a new flying technique called fello’fly, which takes inspiration from migrating geese and showcases the power of collaboration by pairing flights. With this flying technique, the lead aircraft creates an uplift that drives fuel efficiency for the trailing aircraft, called wake energy retrieval, which can reduce fuel consumption up to 5% for the follower aircraft on long-haul flights.

This fall, Delta took a leading role in the next phase of testing, alongside Airbus and its partners. This trial phase' + drupalSettings.data.extlink.extLabel + ' showcased the feasibility of the Airbus Paring Assistance Tool (PAT), demonstrating capability to safely guide two aircraft to meet at a precise time and place, called the rendezvous point, while maintaining full vertical separation and remaining compliant with air traffic regulations. Teams across Delta, including the OCC and Flight Operations, worked together and with participating airlines to showcase the viability of the PAT technology.

Continued inspiration from nature

While fello’fly takes inspiration from geese, Delta’s biomimicry work doesn’t stop there. Earlier this year, Delta added a new partner to its Sustainable Skies Lab that is driving fuel efficiencies inspired by an unlikely source: sharks. MicroTau is an Australian aerospace technology company developing a ‘Riblet Modification Package’ that mimics shark skin to drive drag reduction. This “shark skin” technology can be applied to an aircraft’s fuselage, wings and tail, and once applied, may improve fuel efficiency by up to 4% according to MicroTau’s estimations. Delta is working with MicroTau to ensure their riblet film meets rigorous material-specification requirements prior to installing and testing on live aircraft

Delta is also testing finlets. Finlets are fins, similar to the ones fish have, that can be installed on the back of an aircraft on the fuselage to reshape airflow and reduce drag, ultimately leading to reduced fuel consumption and carbon emissions.

Similarly, Delta has been working for years to add enhanced winglets and lightweight landing gear to its fleet to make them as efficient as possible. Winglets are the curved surfaces seen on the wingtip of aircraft to smooth airflow and reduce drag, allowing aircraft to burn less fuel. Delta finalized the modifications of the split-scimitar winglet upgrade on the 737-800 fleet this year, marking the completion of Delta adding the most advanced winglet technology available to all existing fleets that can be modified.

With approximately 90% of Delta’s carbon emissions coming from jet fuel each year, every decision and modification can drive fuel savings that add up, and these decisions are indicative of Delta’s commitment to make changes within its control on its existing fleet, while also purchasing next-gen aircraft that are more fuel-efficient and supporting research into aircraft that will help Delta reach its decarbonization goals.

THE FUEL WE USE

Ongoing efforts to scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

SAF is the most promising lever known today to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions from conventional jet fuel' + drupalSettings.data.extlink.extLabel + ' and decarbonize Delta’s operation, and it can help support a robust farming, agriculture, and energy industry that supports economic growth in the U.S. However, there isn’t enough SAF available to meet global demand for even a week. That’s why Delta continues to work across industries and with state and federal lawmakers to enact policy solutions that will allow for the U.S. SAF market to reach scale and flourish.

Roots to Runway SAF

In 2025, Delta is on track to increase its SAF usage by 50% compared to 2024. Additionally, Delta collaborated with key partners, including Shell Aviation, Montana Renewables and the Port of Portland for the first commercial-scale SAF uplift at Portland International Airport (PDX). This marked the first commercial scale SAF uplift at PDX.

Delta was also named one of the world’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company for the fifth time. This time around, Delta was recognized in the No. 3 spot – the only airline ranking – in the Corporate Social Responsibility category for its tangible efforts in scaling SAF.

Finally, Delta re-launched Elevate Your Status for the first time since 2019, with a meaningful update. Through Dec. 31, eligible U.S.-based SkyMiles and Medallion Members can make a one-time MQD purchase to reach the next Medallion tier for 2026, with 100% of proceeds (excluding processing fees*) going to support Delta’s SAF program.

Looking ahead

ATOBA Energy and Flying Forest Sign Letter of Intent for Long Term Sustainable Aviation Fuel Offtake Agreement

Transforming Wood Waste into Clean Aviation Fuel

Flying Forest's innovative project, located in Iisalmi, Finland, will convert local wood waste into sustainable aviation fuel using advanced methanol-to-jet technology. The facility is designed to produce 200,000 tons of SAF annually, across three production lines with potential expansion to nearby sites.

The project leverages Finland's abundant forestry residues, with Flying Forest securing agreements with local sawmills for up to 3.75 million tons of sawmill co-products and non-commercial round wood annually. This local feedstock strategy ensures supply security while supporting the circular economy by utilizing waste materials that would otherwise have limited commercial value.

Accelerating SAF Market Growth

""Scaling SAF requires innovative commercial models that work for both producers and end customers,"" said Paul Groves, CEO of Flying Forest. ""This collaboration with ATOBA Energy builds the aligned ecosystem we need to drive innovation, catalyze investment, and accelerate SAF deployment globally.""

The collaboration addresses a critical challenge in the SAF industry: the financial dilemma between producers needing stable long-term contracts to secure project financing and airlines seeking competitive, flexible pricing. ATOBA's aggregation model provides Flying Forest with bankable offtake commitments while offering airlines access to diversified SAF supply at competitive market rates.

""Flying Forest leading edge technology enables a cost efficient transformation of residues to Sustainable Aviation Fuel. By adding Flying Forest to our aggregation platform, we can offer airlines price competitiveness and stability while providing Flying Forest the long-term commitments they need to reach final investment decision"" said Arnaud Namer, CEO of ATOBA Energy.

Green biotech firms to open factories in Grangemouth

Severin Carrell

Two green biotechnology firms have announced they will build new factories at Scotland’s Grangemouth site which will employ up to 460 people, in the first phase of projects to replace hundreds of jobs lost when the PetroIneos refinery closed down.

The projects by MiAlgae, a start-up based in Edinburgh which uses whisky waste to make fish-free Omega 3 oils, and Celtic Renewables, which uses whisky and agricultural byproducts to make chemicals, have won £10m in funding from the Scottish and UK governments to build new plants at Grangemouth.

MiAlgae’s founder and chief executive Douglas Martin said their Omega 3 plant would start production in the second quarter of 2026, employing 75 people. It uses whisky wash, a byproduct, of whisky production to produce plant-based Omega 3 for pet food and fish farm feed.

Martin said their modular plant, which has been given £3m by the UK and Scottish governments, can be rapidly expanded to eventually create up to 310 jobs. Celtic Renewables, which uses agricultural byproducts to make acetone, butanol and ethanol used in cosmetics, chemicals and has been given £6.23m to build a plant expected to employ 149 by 2030.

The projects are being funded by the Grangemouth just transition fund and are linked to the Project Willow programme run by Scottish Enterprise to replace the 400 jobs lost when Grangemouth’s refinery closed down earlier this year, fueling a political storm over mounting job losses from North Sea industries.

Its closure is believed to affect up to 4,200 other jobs in the wider supply chain, intensifying pressure on both governments and Scottish Enterprise to quickly bring in high value jobs.

Jan Robertson, Scottish Enterprise’s director of Grangemouth transition, said both firms were expected to be part of a closely integrated supply and production chain which connected waste and byproducts from farms, food producers and whisky distilleries with bio-energy and bio-technology companies.

The investment agency has been in talks with 140 firms interested in investing at Grangemouth: the long-term goal is to see a sustainable aviation fuel refinery and plastics recycling plants built there.

Oracle shares tumble over 15%

As feared, shares in Oracle have tumbled at the start of trading as Wall Street gives its verdict to the tech giant’s results last night.

Oracle’s shares have dropped by 15.7% at the start of trading, down to $188.29. That, by my maths, knocks almost $100bn off the company’s market capitalisation.

As flagged earlier (see opening post), Oracle missed revenue forecasts last night – and also hiked its capital expenditure plans by $15bn.

That has led to mounting concerns about the company’s massive AI spending and the lack of a clear timeline on returns from the investments.

Cost of insuring Oracle debt against default jumps

Back in the AI world, the cost of insuring Oracle’s debt against default has risen to its highest in at least five years.

That reflects investor concerns about Oracle’s borrowing spree to fund its AI investments, after it missed Wall Street forecasts last night.

Reuters flags that Oracle’s five-year credit default swaps, a derivative that pays bondholders in the event an issuer defaults, rose by nearly 12 basis points on the day to 139 bps, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

This was the highest since at least September 2020, according to LSEG data.

It means it would cost $139 to insure $10,000 of Oracle debt, so still implying a low risk.

Oracle shares are currently down 13.7% in pre-market trading.

Hopes for more green industries to move to Grangemouth

Severin Carrell

Gillian Martin, the Scottish government’s net zero secretary, said she expected other green, low carbon industries such as plastics recycling and sustainable aviation fuel to set up in Grangemouth following the decision by the Scottish and UK governments to fund two bio-technology factories there (see earlier post).

She said the new MiAlgae plant at Grangemouth, which expects to employ 75 people making omega 3 oils for animal and fish farm feed from whisky waste from spring next year, was additional to the types of industries proposed by the Project Willow programme to attract major new employers to Grangemouth, published after PetroIneos announced it was closing its oil refinery there.

Speaking at the site of MiAlgae’s new plant, she said:

“The projects we are announcing today are outwith what we anticipated would be the main outcomes of Project Willow and that’s actually really exciting.

“Today we’re able to make announcements about tangible operations that are going to be here that are going to be providing highly skilled jobs. But I think the most exciting part of it is its future industries.

“It’s industries that are going to be displacing an awful lot of carbon intensive processes, like MiAlgae are doing today - meaning that we’re not importing fish oil from around the world, and we’ve actually got a more sustainable product, but highly skilled work as well.

“The only way to turn the terrible negativity - because people are losing their jobs in traditional industries like PetroIneos, who have made decisions that are outwith government control - is to step in and do what you say you’re going to do, and that’s actually facilitate replacement jobs happening in that area. And that’s what we’re doing here today. We’re only at the start of this.”

Severin Carrell

Michael Shanks, the UK government’s energy minister, said the announcement of nearly £10m in funding to build two new green biotechnology plants at Grangemouth, following the closure of PetroIneos’s oil refinery, was “a really important moment.”

Speaking as heavy machinery began cutting away tarmac for MiAlgae’s new plant, he said: “the truth is, we should have been doing a lot of this a long time ago.”

He said it took time to “get those viable projects coming forward [and] they give us not a sort of flash in the pan moment, they are sustainable, a business rooted in a community like this and interested in expanding”.

Shanks told the Guardian:

“Yes, it’s jobs early next year, which is really important for us to say - that there are jobs coming to Grangemouth very soon. But secondly, it’s a statement of faith that Grangemouth is a positive place, that actually, this isn’t just a place of decline as we’ve seen too much of, but is a huge opportunity as well.”

Pressed on whether enough was being done to demonstrate the transition to net zero created high value jobs and wealth, he said:

“We need to see a lot more examples of these kind of businesses coming forward to demonstrate the jobs. There are actually many and the thousands of jobs being created in Scotland right now in offshore wind, in hydrogen in ports. But we’re not telling the story often enough.

“MiAlgae is actually is a brilliant story to tell of good, well-paid sustainable jobs, of cutting edge innovation. But also it’s the climate argument in a nutshell. It’s good jobs here at Grangemouth, but they’re helping to save the planet.”

London's Heathrow Airport names former BT boss Jansen as chairman

City veteran Philip Jansen has a new challenge – steering Heathrow though its plans for a new runway and terminal expansion.

Jansen has today been named as the chairman of Heathrow, replacing Lord Paul Deighton when he steps down on 31 December.

Heathrow says:

Jansen’s significant experience working with private investors as well as successfully leading a business within a highly regulated environment means that he is ideally placed to help prepare the airport for its next phase of modernisation and oversee the airport’s future strategy.

That strategy includes Heathrow’s proposal for a £33bn scheme for a 2.2-mile (3.5km) north-western runway crossing the M25 motorway, which the government backed last month.

It is also proposing a £15bn project to expand Terminal 2 and ultimately closing Terminal 3.

Jansen has plenty of experience for the role; he’s currently Chair of WPP (the advertising group which is being relegated from the FTSE 100), and was previously the CEO of BT Group, Worldpay Group and Sodexo.

Jansen says:

“Heathrow is the UK’s gateway to growth, therefore I am delighted to be taking on the role as Chairman at this pivotal time for both the business and the country.

I’m keenly aware of the instrumental role Heathrow plays in the success of the UK economy and I’m motivated to play my part in its future, helping to navigate the UK’s hub as it looks to modernise and expand.”

Bain: Global M&A stages great rebound in 2025

A surge of $5bn-plus megadeals has helped to make 2025 the second-largest year for merger and acquisition activity on record, a new report from Bain & Company shows.

Technology M&A, powered by AI-related deals, was behind the year’s surge in merger activity, Bain reports, with $4.8tn of M&A activity this year.

Those $5bn-plus deals “contributed 75% of strategic deal value growth”, Bain says – big bets on large-scale, transformational mergers that are potentially both high-risk and high reward for acquiring companies.

Suzanne Kumar, executive vice president of Bain & Company’s M&A and Divestitures practice, explains:

“Companies across industries are seeing an urgent need to reboot strategy. Amid improved deal market conditions, with both buyers and sellers more confident about valuations, strategic buyers are again putting M&A front and center to drive business growth. The number one reason for increased dealmaking was M&A’s central role in strategy, according to our survey of more than 300 M&A executives,” said

“We see important implications from the dealmaking rebound. This was a year of big bets by companies that traditionally make few deals, and often large-ticket deals become make-or-break moves. Big deals grounded in sound strategy can transform a business and set a new growth trajectory. But deals for less-strategic reasons can be a recipe for value destruction. It’s impossible to overstate the importance to value-creation of clear and early answers to fundamental questions on factors such as shared vision, operating models, decision-making and execution and culture.”

French insurer Axa has revealed it is exercising greater caution on the artificial intelligence build-out when backing financing for the sector.

“We are convinced of the medium-term trend, but we want to avoid financing technological gambles,” AXA Group chief investment officer Jean-Baptiste Tricot told Bloomberg, adding that AI infrastructure has seen “astronomical volumes allocated in recent months.”

Tricot said:

“We are trying to avoid overly specialized data centers and data centers that are dedicated or customized for a single player or a single technology, because we don’t know yet which actor or technology will ultimately win the AI race.”

Axa is “more interested in financing data centers that have inference and general-purpose capabilities,” he added. More here.

Interest rates cut in Turkey

Turkey’s central bank has cut interest rates, in response to a slowdown in inflation, but borrowing costs remain very high.

The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye has cut its policy rate from 39.5% to 38%, and also lowered its overnight lending and borrowing rates.

It says:

In November, consumer inflation was lower than expected due to a downward surprise in food prices.

Following an increase in September, the underlying trend of inflation declined slightly in October and November. Quarterly GDP growth turned out higher than projected in the third quarter.

Leading indicators for the last quarter point out that demand conditions continue to support the disinflation process. While showing signs of improvement, inflation expectations and pricing behavior continue to pose risks to the disinflation process.

Over in Switzerland, the central bank has left interest rates on hold at 0%, a day after America’s central bank cut rates.

Explaining the decision, the SNB says:

Inflation in recent months has been slightly lower than expected. In the medium term, however, inflationary pressure is virtually unchanged compared to the last monetary policy assessment.

Our monetary policy helps to keep inflation within the range consistent with price stability and supports economic development. We will continue to monitor the situation and adjust our monetary policy if necessary, in order to ensure price stability.

READ MORE: Formula E's drive for sustainability

Season 12 promises the biggest, boldest calendar in Formula E history, a record 17-race calendar, spanning iconic cities and cutting-edge circuits. Each stop on the global tour has been engineered with precision, grouping destinations by continent to slash freight mileage and significantly cut CO₂ emissions—proving that scale and sustainability can go together.

The new season started in São Paulo on 6 December, a city powered predominantly by renewable energy, including significant hydropower and bioenergy, which underscores Formula E’s intent to race in markets aligned with its clean-mobility mission.

As the world’s first all-electric FIA World Championship, Formula E doubles down on its mission to deliver world-class racing whilst pursuing its continued commitment to sustainable motorsport, global social impact, and environmentally responsible event delivery.

Key achievements from the Season 10 Sustainability Report

Record-breaking social impact

Social impact programmes reached over 32,000 people across host cities through community outreach and education.

The global initiative FIA Girls on Track expanded to all 11 race markets covered in Season 10, with a year-on-year doubling of participation—and for the first time a “podium commitment” saw a FIA Girls on Track participant present trophies at every E-Prix.

The launch of the education platform Driving Force (presented by PIF) provided modules on air pollution, circular economy, renewable energy and diversity, equity and inclusion.

The introduction of the Better Futures Fund delivered €75,000 in grants to community-led sustainability projects in four host cities Berlin, Shanghai and Portland.

Operational Excellence and Carbon Management

Improvements in logistics enabled by a new global hub increased reliance on biofuel powered sea freight, while the first use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for transcontinental freight—notably between key venues—cut transport-related emissions substantially.

Formula E reaffirmed its environmental credentials, aligning with international standards such as ISO 20121, ISO 14064 and the IWA 42 framework for climate governance and emissions transparency.

Industry Recognition and Global Leadership

Named #1 in the Global Sustainability Benchmark in Sport (GSBS) for a second consecutive year.

Achieved best-ever GSBS score of 85%, with category leadership in Environmental (77%), Social (88%) and Governance (86%).

Actively represented at New York Climate Week alongside the UN General Assembly, reinforcing Formula E’s leadership role in the global climate conversation.

Jeff Dodds, CEO, Formula E, said: “Season 10 proved once again that elite sport and sustainability are not mutually exclusive - they are mutually reinforcing. From using sustainable aviation fuel across continents to leaving lasting legacies in host cities through our Better Futures Fund, our purpose is clearer than ever: to accelerate sustainable human progress through the power of electric racing. Each year we continue to set new records and break new ground, yet our dedication to continually improve is unwavering. While many treat sustainability as a destination or make commitments without true action, our strategy is to always go further, be more ambitious and continually uncover new ways of being innovative and impactful.”

Julia Pallé, VP Sustainability, Formula E, said: “We believe electric racing can do more than inspire - it can directly drive change. Over the last 10 seasons, we have not only inspired others to act but also helped them in delivering real impact. Whether we’re supporting charities, investing in renewable energy or working directly with diverse communities and charity groups, we’re a series not focused on pledges and aspirations, but delivering true progress that can be felt and benefited from right now. For Season 10, we significantly deepened our local community impact and strengthened our commitment to building a more inclusive, equitable and resilient future in every city we race.”

Matt Page, Senior Vice President, Assurance Services EMEA at BSI, said: “Sport has the opportunity to play a leading role in our transition to a sustainable world. Formula E becoming the first sport certified to BSI’s Net Zero Pathway marks an important milestone, not only for the championship, but for global sport as a whole. This achievement reflects a deep, long-term commitment to credible climate action and demonstrates what is possible when ambition is matched with transparency and robust governance.

“Our Net Zero Pathway provides independent assurance across an organisation’s carbon inventory, targets, and management controls, helping ensure that net zero goals are both realistic and achievable. By prioritising real emissions reductions over offsetting, and by auditing progress year-on-year, the Pathway is designed to give organizations the confidence that they are firmly on track to meet net zero by 2050 or sooner.

“We have been proud to collaborate with Formula E, an organisation that continues to set new benchmarks in sustainability. Their leadership shows how any organisation, regardless of sector, can take meaningful and measurable steps toward a net zero future.”

Paul Fowler, VP Global & UK Motorsports DHL, said: “Our collaboration with Formula E shows what’s possible when logistics and sport work together.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents aviation’s most promising and practical path to reducing carbon emissions and achieving 2050 sustainability goals. In May 2025, the UK Government introduced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, which has reached Report Stage in Parliament. The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT UK) is helping the government with advice and guidance on SAF and how it can help the logistics and transport sector.

Understanding SAF’s workings and benefits is crucial for the aviation sector, which is why it must be embraced sooner rather than later. Geoff Maynard, Member of the Aviation Policy Group at CILT (UK), recently gave evidence in Parliament to the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill Committee as MPs further consider the Bill.

Geoff Maynard has worked in the aviation sector for over 25 years, undertaking a wide range of aviation-related commissions, many with extensive environmental content. Educated at Queen’s College, Cambridge, with a degree in Natural Sciences, Geoff has held senior positions in both the private and public sectors. He has worked on many major projects, including Heathrow’s T5, the Olympic Terminal in Beijing, and a new airport for Eswatini.

Here, Geoff gives his expert insight into SAF, its benefits, challenges, future and why the sector must embrace it.

The case for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel that can power aircraft without engine or infrastructure changes. Produced from sustainable resources like agricultural waste, used cooking oil, and municipal solid waste, SAF is a “drop-in” fuel that can be used in existing aircraft engines and fuel systems without modifications. It performs identically to traditional jet fuel in terms of energy density, freezing point, and combustion characteristics, requiring no special training or new equipment.

SAF can also be produced using green electricity, water and carbon dioxide extracted from the air. This SAF, also known as e-fuel, could be produced in very large quantities – constrained only by the investment in a new plant.

Raw materials undergo treatments to remove impurities, then hydro processing, gasification, or fermentation are used to transform them into high-quality aviation fuel that mimics traditional jet fuel properties. The aim for the government is to blend SAF fuel with traditional fossil jet fuel and, with time, increase the SAF fuel ratio and thus lower the use of fossil jet fuel.

SAF offers significant environmental advantages, primarily through a substantial reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions. Unlike traditional jet fuel, which releases ancient carbon into the atmosphere, SAF is derived from materials that recently absorbed atmospheric carbon dioxide, creating a closed carbon loop. This process can lead to lifecycle carbon emission reductions of up to 80% compared to conventional fossil jet fuel.

Additionally, SAF contributes to waste reduction by repurposing materials such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and municipal waste into energy, fostering a circular economy in waste management and energy production.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel policy and adoption

The government is encouraging this trend by first, mandating the percentage of SAF that must be included in aviation jet fuel sold in the UK. Second, the SAF billcurrently going through Parliament establishes a company that can contract with industry to produce SAF at an agreed cost. If the SAF is ultimately sold at a price more than the agreed cost, the excess is returned to the government.

Conversely, if the SAF is sold at less than the agreed cost, the government reimburses the producer for the loss. In this way, the government eliminates the uncertainty that private industry faces in producing SAF, ensuring they cover their costs but also ensuring sufficient SAF is available to meet the mandated percentage.

These measures will help SAF overcome its adoption barriers, primarily its high cost, which is two to five times greater than traditional jet fuel, impacting airline profitability and passenger pricing. The government expects that as the mandated SAF percentage rises, volumes produced will rise and it will naturally bring the price down as demand goes up.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel development

The development of SAF is creating new industries and economic opportunities, with companies investing in production facilities, research, and supply chains. This investment is generating jobs. For airlines, SAF is vital for achieving sustainability goals and meeting passenger demands for eco-friendly travel.

The ability to hit sustainability targets by simply adding a fuel to the mix is the biggest pull factor, but for this to happen, government must encourage and support the development and introduction of SAF. This year, all jet fuel sold in the UK must, by law, contain 2% SAF, with the percentage rising linearly to 10% by 2030, and on to 22% by 2040.

The future of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The future of SAF looks promising due to advancements in technology and increased production. Researchers are creating new methods that lower costs and reduce environmental effects. Major airlines aim for net-zero, which means SAF will play a vital role. Aircraft are being designed for 100% SAF, and production capacity is set to grow.

The availability of fossil jet fuel will reduce as other sectors, notably road transport, move away from fossil diesel and petrol. SAF will fill this gap, and with the support of CILT UK, we are helping bridge the conversation between our industries, airlines and government.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/iStock-1816525962.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 09:57:18.946202

Their consensus? The green transition must be both environmentally effective and socially just – or risk undermining the livelihoods of millions who depend on Africa’s export economy. International trade is a proven route of economic development yet there are risks of reductions in market entry because of the design and application of some trade related climate measures.

European climate measures such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) are rapidly transforming global agrifood markets, given the inclusion of fertiliser but also transportation by maritime and aviation. The roundtable spotlighted how these policies are already impacting exporters, producers and supply cains, given retailers responses, forcing a rethink of how high-value fresh produce reaches consumers.

James MacGregor from Fairmiles warned that decisions made in European horticulture and fresh produce buyer boardrooms ripple through entire value chains in Africa. “Buyers must move beyond carbon metrics and costs alone,” he said. “They need to consider what those decisions mean for the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, workers and communities whose incomes depend on these exports.

Emphasis was placed by TMA CEO, Dave Beer on the adjustment costs related to climate-linked trade rules to African exporters, especially in agri-forestry, horticulture, and emissions-intensive sectors. To aid the readiness of businesses in the continent, TMA is responding by building national traceability systems, supporting modal shifts to low-emission freight, and positioning compliance readiness as a competitive advantage for African trade.

Jodie Keane, Principal Research Fellow at ODI Global emphasised the risk of a poorly designed green transition: without solid evidence, fair pricing arrangements and technology tailored to producers’ realities, the green transition could become “economically destructive rather than environmentally transformative”. She called for clear, accessible data and communication to demonstrate how better-designed supply chains can deliver positive outcomes for all.

The modal shift debate: air freight vs sea freight

One of the roundtable’s most pressing concerns was the growing trend among buyers de-risking by reducing air-freighted imports in favour of sea freight, despite limited evidence that is always better for the climate or consumers. Participants cautioned that when the associated costs of certification, carbon credits or modal shifts are passed straight to farmers, the transition threatens to become unsustainable.

Kenya’s recent pilots under the TMA’s EU-funded BEEEP programme offer a glimpse of what’s possible. By shifting products from road and air to a combination of rail Standard Gauge Railway) and refrigerated sea shipping, these trials have maintained freshness and reduced emissions. However, Charles Tulezi of the Kenya Flower Council highlighted the trade-offs: moving to sea freight often requires different crop varieties, new post-harvest treatments, stronger cold-chain systems and investment in inland consolidation hubs are critical to success. Without these, smallholder farmers, who form much of the export base, risk exclusion from lucrative EU markets.

Aviation’s role in a just transition

Airlines are offering climate-mitigation alternatives such as carbon-compensation schemes and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) options, as shared by Lufthansa Cargo’s Zlatic Zlatko. While SAF supply remains costly and scarce today, industry leaders predict prices will fall as demand grows. Against a backdrop where millions of livelihoods are tied to fresh-produce exports, the notion of a just transition was a recurring theme throughout the debate. The consensus was that neither air freight nor sea freight alone can safeguard Africa’s export economy in a low-carbon future.

What is needed, they concluded, is a balanced, multi-modal strategy supported by robust data and coherent policy that reflects the complex realities of African supply chains.

James MacGregor stressed that a fair transition depends on retailers and consumers in export destinations sharing the burdenof climate costs. “Climate-related expenses cannot simply be transferred to African producers,” he said, while Trizer Omugar, TMA’s Green Trade Programme Officer, urged stakeholders to co-invest, co-design, and embed compliance into the DNA of Africa’s trade systems to turn the climate-trade regulatory compliance burden into an opportunity for spurring continental business competitiveness. Jodie Keane added that the “green squeeze must be avoided. We need to work to find solutions that are both good for the climate and make commercial sense”.

David Beer, CEO of TradeMark Africa, echoed this sentiment underscoring that decarbonisation and development must go hand in hand. “The transition must be green – but it must also be fair,” he concluded.",https://media.odi.org/images/Securing_a_Fair_Greener_Transitio.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 09:57:23.475692

Once operating, the plant could lower lifecycle emissions by 89% compared with conventional jet fuel.

The agreement marks the first time Topsoe’s solid oxide technology will be used commercially for clean fuel production. The modules for the project will be manufactured at the company’s new 500MW facility in Herning, Denmark, and are scheduled for delivery in 2028, subject to the FID.

Topsoe’s CCO for Power-to-X, Sundus Cordelia Ramli, said the contract represents “a major milestone for our team,” reflecting years of work advancing SOEC technology. CNF co-founder Alasdair Lumsden said the depth of technical data supporting Topsoe’s systems “played a key role in earning our confidence.”

According to Topsoe, its high-temperature SOEC technology can produce 20–30% more hydrogen from the same amount of electricity compared with PEM or alkaline electrolysers, helping reduce energy costs per tonne of hydrogen. While promising, SOEC remains an emerging technology, with no large-scale systems yet in operation worldwide.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-11.png,N,,2025-12-11 09:57:39.180229

Turning COP30 takeaways into action Post-COP30, the message to business travel is clear – now is not the time to take our eye off the ball.","While the recent COP30 summit that took place in Belém, Brazil, did not fully meet the high expectations set by many in the climate community – particularly around a binding commitment to phase out fossil fuels and more ambitious emissions targets – it nonetheless marked important progress. The summit delivered new pledges to triple adaptation finance and advance harmonisation of carbon reporting standards, and saw unprecedented engagement from both the public and private sectors.

The legitimacy and long-term relevance of the business travel sector will increasingly depend on its willingness to lead on climate action. Companies that embed sustainability in their travel programmes will be better positioned to meet future requirements, manage risk, and capture competitive advantage.

The disappointment voiced by many observers reflects the scale of the challenge and the urgency for faster action. However, COP30’s outcomes reinforce that waiting for perfect policy consensus is not an option.

SAF remains a critical lever

One of the most significant COP30 announcements for business travel was the pledge to quadruple sustainable fuel (SAF) production and use by 2035, known as the Belém 4X initiative.

This is a voluntary, international pledge endorsed by 23 countries, including Brazil, Italy, Japan, and India. It is designed to accelerate decarbonisation in hard-to-abate sectors like aviation, with technical support from the International Energy Agency. The goal is for sustainable fuels to cover up to 15 per cent of global aviation demand by 2035, compared to less than 1% today.

For travel managers, this means: partnering with airlines committed to SAF purchase; exploring SAF purchase agreements or credits to offset flight emissions; and communicating SAF adoption as part of your sustainability narrative.

Scope 3 emissions and carbon reporting

COP30 amplified the focus on Scope 3 emissions, which include indirect emissions from activities like business travel by advancing global standards for carbon reporting and signalling a shift toward mandatory disclosure.

Many organisations already report Scope 1 and 2 emissions, but Scope 3 often represents the largest share of their carbon footprint, sometimes up to 90 per cent of total emissions for companies in particular sectors. This is set against the backdrop of upcoming sustainability reporting regulations in many parts of the world.

New partnerships between the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and ISO are making it easier and more consistent for organisations to measure and report these emissions. For corporate travel, this means embedding carbon metrics into booking platforms, using dashboards to monitor progress against reduction targets, and integrating carbon data into procurement and reporting frameworks. Companies that proactively manage and disclose travel emissions can strengthen their sustainability credentials, meet growing investor expectations, and stay ahead of evolving regulations.

Adaptation finance and climate resilience

Beyond emissions, COP30 delivered a major boost to adaptation finance, pledging to double funding by 2025 and triple it by 2035. Adaptation finance is funding which is dedicated to helping other countries, communities and businesses adjust to the impacts of climate change such as extreme weather, rising sea levels and infrastructure risks.

Unlike mitigation finance, which focuses on reducing emissions, adaptation finance supports investments in resilience measures – such as flood defenses, early warning systems or contingency planning – that help organisations and travellers manage climate-related disruptions.

This matters for business travel because climate-related disruptions such as extreme weather and infrastructure failures pose growing risks to mobility and safety. Companies should integrate climate risk assessments into travel policies and consider resilience measures such as diversified supplier networks and contingency planning.

Sustainable business travel in corporate strategy

COP30 reinforced that the direction of policy, regulation, and stakeholder expectation is clear: progress continues, and the industry can no longer use uncertainty as an excuse for inaction when it comes to sustainability. Companies that embed sustainability in their travel programmes will be better positioned to meet future requirements, manage risk, and capture competitive advantage. A recent GBTA survey found that 78% of travel buyers consider sustainability a top priority, and the developments we’ve seen at COP30 are likely to accelerate this trend.

Turning COP30 takeaways into action

Post-COP30, the message to business travel is clear – now is not the time to take our eye off the ball. To stay ahead of regulatory changes, meet stakeholder expectations, and contribute meaningfully to global climate goals, travel managers and procurement leaders should undertake the following:

• Audit current emissions: Establish a baseline for your organisation’s travel-related carbon footprint;

• Update travel policies: Encourage rail over air for short-haul routes and promote hybrid meetings;

• Engage suppliers: Partner with those offering sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) options or carbon offset programmes;

• Invest in technology: Use tools that calculate emissions per booking and suggest lower-carbon alternatives;

• Align reporting frameworks: Integrate carbon data into procurement decisions and ensure reporting meets COP30-aligned standards for transparency;

• Communicate progress: Share sustainability achievements with stakeholders.

Choosing sustainability today means shaping tomorrow’s travel landscape. It’s a strategic move that reduces carbon impact and builds long-term business value.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/BTNE/uploadedImages/4_Learn/Olivia%20Ruggles-Brise.jpeg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-12-11 09:57:56.488409

The Securing America’s Fuels Act introduced in the House would reinstate the higher, SAF-specific rate within the Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit and extend it through 2033, providing a tax credit of $1.75 per gallon for qualifying producers.

Congress had extended the broader clean fuel credit earlier this year but removed the bonus rate for SAF, a change that caught many in the industry by surprise. SAF developers warned that without the higher credit, financing for new plants would become more difficult.

Some projects were paused almost immediately, and others were pushed into “wait and see” mode. Supporters of the new bill say it offers the long-term clarity producers need to resume construction and move ahead with expansion plans.

Sustainable aviation fuel is a drop-in replacement for conventional jet fuel that can be used by today’s aircraft without modification. It is produced from a range of feedstocks, from agricultural waste to used cooking oil, municipal waste streams and, in the case of e-SAF, synthetic fuels created with renewable energy and captured carbon.

SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions compared with fossil-based jet fuel, making it central to the aviation industry’s decarbonization plans. But supply remains extremely limited, and production costs are far higher than traditional fuel.

Those limitations are front of mind for airlines. At the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Media Day on December 9, 2025, Director General Willie Walsh warned that global SAF production is nowhere near meeting demand and that even the industry’s 2030 goal of 10% SAF use now appears out of reach.

Walsh argued that the barrier is not willingness to buy the fuel but the lack of availability. He also criticized the European Union’s mandates, saying they have pushed up prices without delivering the supply needed to meet airlines’ commitments.

Lawmakers behind the new US bill say the updated tax credit is aimed at addressing that problem. Rep. Mike Flood of Nebraska said the measure would help drive a new “biofuels revolution” and support rural economies that supply feedstocks. Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas said producers, farmers, and airlines need long-term policy signals so they can plan investments with confidence.

Industry groups have welcomed the bill. Airlines for America, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition, and the National Business Aviation Association all issued statements supporting the move, saying the extended credit gives producers the predictability they need to build out capacity. NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen said restoring the full rate “provides the clarity and stability needed to unlock investment, expand supply and accelerate progress.”",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/12/An-aircraft-being-refueled-with-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-1200x800-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 09:58:00.846411

The firm, which manages more than US$1 trillion in assets, will seek to bring in as many as four people to be based in Singapore to focus on such deals, said Daniel Cheng, Brookfield’s head of renewable power and transition for Asia-Pacific. That will add to a hire earlier this year.

Countries in the region are “growing very rapidly,” Cheng said in an interview. “They recognise they both need to address the demand side for power and energy, but also the technologies available to actually decarbonise.”

The clean technology sector has rebounded this year on forecasts for electricity consumption to keep soaring as air conditioners to AI data centres add new demand, and as investment on decarbonisation climbs.

The S&P’s main gauge tracking clean energy has advanced about 44 per cent this year, well over double the gain in the MSCI World Index.

Brookfield, which has more than a dozen people in its Asia-Pacific renewable power and transition team, said in October it had raised US$20 billion for the world’s largest private fund dedicated to the global clean energy transition.

BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners LP and Pentagreen Capital have also boosted infrastructure debt teams in South-east Asia amid a push on decarbonisation projects.

At the same time, European utilities including EDP Renewables, Equinor and Orsted are among those to have recently paused or withdrawn from projects in South-east Asia, blaming a lack of long-term policy clarity and disconnected grid infrastructure.

“We’re leaning in rather than pulling out, and hopefully other investors leaving the region will make it more attractive for us,” Cheng said. “Less competition is always good.”

Last month, Brookfield completed the acquisition of Alba Renewables, with projects in the Philippines and Thailand, and also added a wind project in Vietnam. The asset manager is working to jointly develop and operate at least 1.5 gigawatts of utility-scale solar and battery energy storage projects with Malaysia-based Solarvest Holdings Bhd.

LONDON, Dec. 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Sulphur shortages, oil surpluses, carbon costs, and the geopolitics of critical minerals and trade tariffs are all set to cast a long shadow over commodities markets in the coming 12 months. Those are among the many major issues — some more surprising than others — identified in global energy and commodity price reporting agency Argus' new Energy and Commodities horizon published today.

Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks said: ""The world has grown used to the remarkable resilience of commodities markets over the past three years. But the challenges of 2026 look set to shake things up in a way not seen since Russia went into Ukraine. And as a net importer, Europe's commodity markets look set to be in the crosshairs.""

10 Key Commodity and Energy Market Themes for 2026:

UKRAINE of course will remain central to the fate of many markets. Supply chains for oil, coal, fertilizers, wheat, and natural gas have all reshaped themselves since 2022. If there is a peace deal, then the global flow of commodities may radically change again. Moscow is unlikely to agree to anything which does not remove sanctions and tariffs on its commodities; Europe's ""once bitten twice shy"" political stance may melt at the prospect of cheap diesel, or even a possible return of natural gas. That in turn could alter the picture for India, China, Brazil and the Middle East, all of whom have benefited in different ways from Europe's self-imposed Russian abstinence. And a flood of cheap oil products could spell doom for the continent's already struggling refining sector.

Europe ratchets up efforts to CUT CARBON EMISSIONS. The effects of the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) are difficult to predict. It could drive up import costs for everything from steel to fertilizers. But a lot of smart money is on CBAM forcing a margin reduction for non-European producers competing with EU commodities that already carry a carbon tax. Uncertainty about how the mechanism will be implemented could also starkly affect the volume of imports in the first six months of 2026.

AVIATION faces an interesting ride as the screws tighten on carbon obligations for jet fuel. The first year of European obligations to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) saw SAF prices assessed by Argus fall to record lows of 2.3x conventional jet fuel, before rising to peak at more than 4x and then falling back to 3x after an influx of SAF imports in the final quarter. Volatility is likely to persist going into the second year of obligations. UK and EU regulators are pinning hope on the use of synthetic e-SAF, which is derived from clean hydrogen and Argus shows is around 13x the cost of conventional jet fuels. Ambitious mandates for e-SAF kick in over the coming years but a standoff between policy makers, producers and airlines is hindering the region's uptake of SAF and e-SAF.

BIOFUELS markets could be disrupted by the uneven application of differing regimes across Europe — the EU's new RED III renewable energy directive is supposed to go live in a couple of weeks, but member governments, including in Europe's biggest biofuels markets, Germany and the Netherlands, were still finalising legislation in the closing weeks of 2025 for compliance starting 1 January. Despite differing degrees of progress across EU member states, Argus expects European biofuel demand in road transportation to jump by 8% next year, driven mostly by hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO).

The SULPHUR market is sounding alarm bells. Long regarded as a low-volatility oil and gas refining by-product feeding into the phosphate fertilizer market, sulphur has attained new importance because of its use in the electric vehicle (EV) battery sector — for nickel processing and LFP (lithium iron phosphate) production. Coupled with a Russian ban on sulphur exports while Moscow struggles to fix its damaged refineries, this new dynamic has pushed up Argus sulphur prices from their normal $80-180/t fob Middle East range to close to $500/t. That has serious implications for farmers around the world.

Geopolitics, trade wars, tariffs and sanctions will continue to dominate METALS. Critical minerals and rare earths dominated the headlines for much of this year. Despite confident noises from Washington and now Europe, there are only tentative signs of any easing of China's export controls on rare earth metals. And despite greater government support for critical mineral projects, the west's dependence on Chinese supply is not going to disappear any time soon, given the lead time involved in such complex operations. The technology and military sectors also remain in a bind, courtesy of Beijing's restrictions on exports of electronics metals such as germanium, prices for which have more than tripled to around $6,000/kg since controls were introduced in 2023.

In CRUDE OIL, the debate is not whether there will be a surplus, but how big it will be — Argus' own estimates point to something in the order of 1.5mn b/d. This has raised questions over whether the Opec+ group of producers, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, can press ahead with regular output increases as it seeks to unwind some 1.65mn b/d of output cuts. The group has already agreed to pause monthly increases in the first quarter — a tacit acknowledgement of those oversupply concerns. But unless crude prices collapse to the mid-$50s/bl, Opec+ may be tempted to start opening the taps again from the second quarter, prioritising internal group harmony over propping up prices.

NATURAL GAS: The flexibility challenge facing European gas and global liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets may shift gear in 2026, if we see closures of some underground gas storage sites in Germany. Argus forecasts that shuttering the two German sites most at risk of closure would reduce Europe's supply buffer by the equivalent of nearly 60 LNG cargoes per year and make the continent even more reliant on LNG during the winter. Europe's gas market has been transformed since 2022 — LNG shipments have increased by nearly two-thirds and now total close to 120mn t/yr, having replaced most Russian pipeline supply. Nevertheless, in 2026, one or two large gas storage sites may close, because the difference between the price of gas in the summer and winter — how traders make money from using storage — is shrinking. If this happens, it would increase price volatility and raise the risk of price spikes, particularly in late-winter periods. LNG should be able to fill the supply gap, but it is slower to respond to price signals, and Europe potentially has to fend off competition from Asia to secure volumes.

FREIGHT could return to the Red Sea. Containership owner Maersk has already indicated it is considering a return, and at least two containerships have recently sailed through the Suez Canal, which gives rise to hope that 2026 could be the year that shipowners return en masse. Tankers will be slower to respond than container vessels, as the shorter journey will generate lower profits and require higher risk. More generally in tanker markets, a shortage of available very large crude carriers (VLCCs) will push crude traders to seek smaller-sized vessels for their WTI shipments to Europe next year. A lack of recent VLCC deliveries from shipyards and booming demand for the 2mn bl ships to carry Americas crude to Asia is narrowing any economy-of-scale savings traders get with larger vessels.

Thermal COAL markets will be buffeted by the Ukraine conflict and pressure from global decarbonisation efforts. Any peace deal that eases sanctions on Russia could flood the market with cheap, high-quality Russian coal. This will create immense pressure on export prices in competing nations such as Australia and Indonesia, while also offering cheap base-load energy for the world's two biggest importers, China and India, and growing demand hubs in southeast Asia. Meanwhile, the pace of nuclear plant restarts in Japan and elsewhere in Asia, along with renewables growth, is encouraging more power generators to switch away from coal. That said, the thirst for power created by the expansion of AI data centres is likely to provide support and keep overall production and trade volumes hovering around 2024's record highs, when trade hit 1.1bn t and production reached 7.8bn t. A key question is whether the US coal renaissance will gather even more momentum, now that Henry Hub gas prices are back above $5/mn Btu and power demand is set to surge.

Potential to further develop system support capabilities and FlexGen

Drax Group CEO, Will Gardiner said:

“It is vital that the UK maintains its energy security and delivers affordable routes to decarbonisation into the 2030s and beyond. Drax stands ready to invest in and grow our portfolio to deliver the renewable and flexible power the country needs while also supporting economic growth in the communities where we operate.

“By 2050, demand for power is expected to double, while secure gas generation reduces and intermittent renewable generation increases, meaning more dispatchable and reliable generation will be required to help keep the lights on when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.

“Aligned to the UK’s future energy needs and underpinned by a strong balance sheet, good cash generation, and a disciplined approach to capital allocation, we are working to maximise the value of our existing portfolio, while driving growth over the short, medium and long term.

“Our year to date operational and financial performance has been strong, and we are focused on delivering c.£3 billion of free cash flow between 2025 and 2031, which can support investment in energy security, data centres and flexible, renewable energy underpinning long-term value creation and returns to shareholders.”

Full year expectations

Reflecting a strong performance across the Group in the second half of 2025, Drax now expects 2025 full year Adj. EBITDA to be around the top end of consensus estimates(3). Full year expectations remain subject to continued good operational performance.

Generation contracted power sales

As at 9 December 2025, Drax had c.£2.3 billion of contracted forward power sales between 2025 and Q1 2027 on its Renewables Obligation (RO) biomass, pumped storage and hydro generation assets. RO generation is fully hedged for 2025 and 2026, with over £1 billion of associated ROCs.

Capital returns

In October 2025, the Group completed a £300 million share buyback programme which had commenced in August 2024. The Group subsequently began a £450 million share buyback programme (first announced in July 2025), with an initial £75 million tranche. In aggregate, during 2025, up to 9 December 2025, the share buyback programmes have purchased c.33 million shares for c.£216 million. The total number of voting rights in Drax Group, excluding treasury shares, as at 9 December 2025 was c.341 million. In October 2025 an interim dividend of 11.6 pence per share was paid, totalling c.£40 million.

Outlook

Adj. EBITDA and free cash flow targets from existing business

The Group is continuing to target post 2027 Adj. EBITDA of £600-700 million pa before development expenditure. Delivery of this target is underpinned by disciplined cost management and an operating model adapted to reflect the structure of the recently signed low-carbon, dispatchable CfD agreement with the Low Carbon Contracts Company (a UK Government body) for Drax Power Station, combined with a high-performance culture.

Reflecting growing UK power demand, combined with an increased system reliance on intermittent and inflexible generation, Drax expects to grow its FlexGen business to comprise a greater proportion of total Adj. EBITDA over time.

Open Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGTs) will be a key component of the FlexGen portfolio. The flexibility of these grid balancing assets can enable the increased use of intermittent renewables across the UK system, supporting energy security and a reduction in net carbon emissions. Reflecting these factors, Drax now expects to retain these assets as a part of its FlexGen portfolio.

Taking strong cash flows from the current business (2025-2026) together with targeted Adj. EBITDA (2027-2031), plus working capital, less maintenance capex, interest and tax, Drax is targeting free cash flow of c.£3 billion (2025-2031)(5).

The Group’s capital allocation policy remains unchanged. Drax expects to initially allocate >£1 billion of free cash flow to shareholder returns (2025-2031). This is inclusive of the ongoing £450 million three-year share buyback programme and the continuation of its long-standing policy to pay a sustainable and growing dividend, through which the dividend per share has grown on average by 11% pa since 2017.

Drax expects to allocate up to c.£2 billion to incremental investment, primarily in the flexible and renewable energy the UK needs, as well as opportunities to maximise value from the Drax Power Station site.

Returns to shareholders and investment for growth follow a capital ranking process which aims to maximise risk adjusted returns to shareholders.

Options to invest in growth – FlexGen – flexible, renewable energy

The UK National Energy System Operator’s Future Energy Scenarios indicate a doubling of power demand by 2050, via electrification and new sources of demand, including data centres. At the same time, the continued decarbonisation of the system is leading to a greater reliance on intermittent renewables. The system is becoming cleaner but more volatile, driving a growing need for dispatchable power and system support services, creating long-term earnings opportunities for, and value from, the Group’s FlexGen assets. While the trend is clear, it is hard to forecast from year to year, being dependent on weather and associated renewable activity as much as underlying commodity prices.

This position informs the Group’s view on the value of its FlexGen portfolio and opportunities for growth which can support energy security and the continued deployment of renewables. Since acquisition of the pumped storage and hydro assets in 2018, utilisation of these assets has increased significantly, delivering a five-year payback.

Pumped Storage and Hydro

An £80 million investment to refurbish and upgrade two units at Cruachan Power Station is progressing, with an initial planned outage programme through 2025. The project, which is underpinned by 15-year Capacity Market agreements worth over £220 million (c.£15 million Adj. EBITDA pa), will add 40MW of additional capacity by 2027 and improve unit operations. An additional planned outage programme associated with a transformer upgrade is expected to complete shortly.

OCGTs

Drax expects to take commercial control of the first of the three OCGTs (Hirwaun Power) in Q1 2026. The unit is now commissioning and receiving capacity market payments. The second and third sites are expected to commence commissioning in 2026.This is later than originally planned, primarily due to delays in grid connection by the relevant authorities.

Inclusive of the OCGTs Drax remains committed to its validated SBTi(9) targets and continues to assess options to realise this commitment.

BESS

The Group sees BESS as an important new technology for its FlexGen portfolio, adding fast response capabilities to long duration pumped storage and OCGT assets, which could allow the portfolio to provide a wider range of system support services to the grid.

Drax is developing a GW scale pipeline of BESS opportunities comprised of (1) physical assets and (2) the capabilities to optimise third-party assets with the provision of route to market, floor and tolling structures. In this regard, Drax already provides a route to market for c.2,000 embedded third-party renewable assets with capacity of c.800MW via its Energy Solutions business.

In October 2025, Drax signed an agreement with Apatura Limited (“Apatura”) to acquire three BESS projects, which when fully commissioned will provide capacity totalling 260MW. Drax will pay a fixed amount of £157.2 million in staged payments between 2025 and 2028, reflecting construction milestones and including payments to Apatura linked to their delivery of the projects. The acquisition of the Marfleet (England) and Neilston (Scotland) projects is now complete, with the acquisition of the East Kilbride (Scotland) project expected to be finalised in 2026.

The Group is also assessing options for other renewables, which can complement its FlexGen model.

Options to invest in growth – Drax Power Station Site

The Drax Power Station site comprises over 1,000 acres and 4GW of capacity and grid access, with 2.6GW of active dispatchable generation, cooling systems, and proximity to the UK fibre network.

The Group is focused on options to maximise value from the site, which could utilise multiple generation technologies including its existing biomass generation as well as flexible, renewable energy, to continue to support energy security, while potentially meeting the power demands of a large-scale data centre and in the long-term the potential for carbon removals from BECCS(10).

Data centre

Drax is considering a range of options for the site which could utilise its existing land, grid access, active generation, cooling solutions, site security, location and skilled workforce to meet the needs of data centre developers.

Drax is preparing a planning application to support the potential option for a first phase data centre of c.100MW on land identified at Drax Power Station, using existing infrastructure and transformers previously used to support coal generation to import power directly from the grid (front-of-the-meter). This could support the operation of a data centre at Drax Power Station as soon as 2027.

In November 2025, Drax signed a CfD agreement with the UK Government to provide c.6TWh of biomass generation pa between April 2027 and March 2031 – equivalent to c.30% of baseload output – with a strike price of £109.90/MWh (2012 real). In addition to the option to produce additional merchant generation above the cap and for system support and ancillary services, the agreement includes a mechanism for Drax to request up to 500MW to power a data centre during this period. This is subject to agreement with the UK Government, taking into account a number of factors, including value for money for consumers, energy security, and sustainability.

In the long term Drax is assessing options for over 1GW of data centre capacity, which is expected to utilise existing generation capabilities at Drax Power Station to provide a distributed (behind-the-meter) energy solution with around-the-clock renewable power directly to a data centre under a long-term Power Purchase Agreement, subject to necessary consents.

Any decision to develop data centres at Drax Power Station will require a full assessment of the capital cost and investment case as well as establishment of the commercial and development structures, including joint ventures.

Pellet Production

In the medium term, the Group’s US business is well underpinned by sales into the UK. The Group’s Canadian business, which primarily sells pellets into Asia, is expected to be more challenged, which has contributed to the decision to close Drax’s pellet plant in Williams Lake. Against this backdrop the Group does not currently expect to invest in additional capacity in the short to medium term, including the paused Longview project.

In the long term, Drax remains positive on biomass’ role in industrial decarbonisation and carbon removals via its Elimini business. Drax is continuing to assess options for own-use and third-party sales, from existing and new markets, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which could represent a major market opportunity from 2030 onwards.

Other matters

Drax will report its full year results on Thursday 26 February 2026.

Notes:

Flexible Generation (FlexGen) is currently comprised of the Group’s pumped storage and hydro assets, three OCGT plants which are expected to enter commercial service in 2026 and an Energy Solutions business which provides renewable energy and services to I&C customers as well as a route to market for small renewable assets.

According to IATA, SAF production in 2025 is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (2.4 billion litres), doubling from the 1 million tonnes produced in 2024.
“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry.
“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park.
“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has released updated estimates for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, highlighting significant challenges for the aviation industry in meeting decarbonisation targets.

According to IATA, SAF production in 2025 is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (2.4 billion litres), doubling from the 1 million tonnes produced in 2024. However, growth is projected to slow in 2026, reaching just 2.4 million tonnes. SAF will account for only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, rising to 0.8% in 2026, while the SAF premium is expected to add $3.6 billion (€3.1 billion) in fuel costs for the airline industry in 2025.

This downward revision from earlier forecasts reflects insufficient policy support, high SAF prices — up to five times the cost of fossil-based jet fuel in mandated markets — and underutilised production capacity.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry.

“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further decarbonisation, regulators need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will actually work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA director general.

Mandates in Europe and the UK have failed to accelerate SAF adoption. In Europe, the ReFuelEU Aviation framework has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains, forcing airlines to pay up to five times the price of conventional jet fuel without guaranteed supply or consistent documentation. In the UK, SAF mandates have triggered similar price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb significant costs.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Regulators must recognise the current approach is not working and urgently correct course. Announcements alone are not enough – action is required,” Walsh added.

“Current policies are not producing the desired effect. Regulators must ensure SAF production is viable long-term, achieve scale, and bring costs down. Mandates alone have done the opposite, and it would be outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA senior vice-president for sustainability and chief economist.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IATA-warns-pic-Biofuel-11-12-5486732-768x576.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 02:56:57.440146

Including coprocessing volumes, biodiesel and renewable diesel production can now equate to more than 10% of Canada’s diesel use.
Tidewater Renewables Ltd., Canada’s first greenfield renewable diesel facility, brought a countervailing (anti-subsidy) and anti-dumping complaint to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal regarding imported U.S. renewable diesel.
However, concerns about an even playing field for Canada’s renewable diesel industry remain.
It’s really value-added manufacturing, more biofuels.” A Level Playing Field The BPI could help level the playing field for Canadian biofuel producers, but Baines is waiting for the final ruling to see what tangible impact the incentive and CFR amendments will have.","In the pursuit of supporting biofuels, both sides of the U.S.-Canada border have implemented incentive structures to encourage the production or use of renewable fuels over fossil fuels. However, the U.S. 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit has proven to be a powerful driver of domestic production by granting producers monetary compensation aligned with a lower CI score. U.S. biofuel producers responded, but with increased production came the need for somewhere to send that fuel. Less than two years before the Inflation Reduction Act’s 45Z took effect in 2025, Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations—which incentivize the use of renewable fuels—were rolled out nationwide.

Almost simultaneously with the rollout of 45Z, trade turbulence between the U.S. and Canada began, followed by tensions with China that caused disruptions for Canadian biofuel producers, oilseed processors and farmers. Biofuel producers are encouraging the Canadian government to take a strong stance in support of the domestic industry in response to the United States’ 45Z credit. In September 2025, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a Biofuels Production Incentive totaling $370 million over two years, designed to support the country’s biofuels industry. At the time, Biodiesel Magazine reported that the incentive would be applied on a per-liter basis to producers of biodiesel and renewable diesel from January 2026 through December 2027, capped at 300 million liters per facility.

Fred Ghatala with Advanced Biofuels Canada calls the BPI a “step toward” addressing the competitive landscape that has emerged in North America. He explains that the complete renewable diesel and biodiesel supply chains—from feedstock origination to processing to end use under Canada’s federal Clean Fuel Regulations and various provincial policies—can now take place in Canada for “one of the first times in the history of the Canadian biofuel sector.” Canada has roughly 2.4 billion liters (634 million gallons) of installed renewable diesel capacity and 500 million liters of installed biodiesel capacity. Including coprocessing volumes, biodiesel and renewable diesel production can now equate to more than 10% of Canada’s diesel use.

With the introduction of the CFR and British Columbia’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Canada became a top destination for renewable fuels due to the monetary incentive created by compliance credit values. Canadian producers have struggled to maintain ongoing production, since U.S. producers can access production credits under 45Z, then export fuel to Canada and also receive credits under the CFR, BC LCFS, and other provincial programs with compliance credit systems.

Tidewater Renewables Ltd., Canada’s first greenfield renewable diesel facility, brought a countervailing (anti-subsidy) and anti-dumping complaint to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal regarding imported U.S. renewable diesel. The Canadian Border Services Agency’s investigation was dropped by the tribunal in early May 2025. However, concerns about an even playing field for Canada’s renewable diesel industry remain.

“Our big irritant has been the unlevel playing field with the U.S. subsidies, being able to get a production subsidy and then also attract the emissions credits on the other side going across a free trade border,” says Jeremy Baines, president and CEO of Tidewater Renewables.

In light of Canada’s endorsement of the Belém 4X Pledge—which aims to quadruple biofuels use by 2035—the BPI aims to stabilize domestic producers while amendments are made to the CFR that provide the sector with a competitive edge and increase production. “Essentially, the BPI helps us survive so that we can thrive in the near- to medium-term to expand and increase agricultural economic resilience, domestic energy security, Canadian GDP and of course reduce GHG emissions in the process,” Ghatala says.

Accompanying the BPI, the Canadian government announced support for canola farmers through updates to the AgriMarketing Program, which promotes Canadian agri-food products, and the Advanced Payments Program, which offers low-interest cash advances of up to 50% of the expected value of eligible products. The announcements included an added $75 million investment in the AgriMarketing Program over five years and an increase in the interest-free limit for canola advances from $250,000 to $500,000 under the Advanced Payments Program.

Canola Complications

The canola industry is also facing trade-related challenges. Canadian canola farmers and processors are seeking new markets after China—Canada’s second-largest market for canola behind the U.S.—closed its doors by implementing prohibitively high tariffs on canola seed, oil and meal. Beginning in March 2025, Canadian producers were unable to ship canola oil and meal to China. Canola seed shipments were cut off in August with the implementation of additional tariffs. As relationships with the U.S.—Canada’s largest trading partner—remain strained following tariffs imposed in early 2025 by the Trump administration, Canadian oilseed processors and farmers need another market, preferably a domestic one.

Markets the size of the U.S. and China are hard to replace, explains Chris Vervaet, representative of the Canola Council and executive director of the Canadian Oilseed Processors Association. However, he says this challenging season could galvanize the pursuit of new opportunities.

Renewable diesel production has the potential to utilize significant amounts of canola. A renewable diesel plant producing 1 billion liters of fuel annually requires roughly 2.5 million metric tons of canola seed when using canola oil as the feedstock. This volume represents about half of what is typically exported to China each year. “That’s the opportunity that we’re chasing, that’s the opportunity that we’re talking about when it comes to biofuels and market diversification,” Vervaet says.

He adds that the CFR is starting to bear fruit; additional renewable diesel capacity has come online, and refiners have announced further investments in coprocessing capacity. Unfortunately, Canada’s renewable diesel industry has encountered headwinds in recent years with the end of the biodiesel blenders tax credit and the implementation of 45Z. Although the biofuels sector has room to expand and utilize the growing amount of canola oil crushed domestically in western provinces such as Saskatchewan, the industry is currently in survival mode, according to Ghatala. “Keeping the lights on” for Canadian biofuel producers is crucial as producers on both sides of the border deal with uncertainty caused by the new variable credit structure based on carbon intensity.

Vervaet explains that—on its own—the BPI does not meet the challenge. “What it does is keep the lights on for some of the existing biofuel facilities in Canada that are making renewable diesel and biodiesel,” he says. “And that’s a good thing, but it doesn’t drive any incremental demand for canola, and in the situation that we find ourselves where the largest, or one of our largest, markets is completely closed for canola, we need more. We need more than just keeping the lights on.”

Ghatala explains that while the U.S. 45Z works as an “exportable trade subsidy,” the BPI does not have the same scope, serving instead as a short-term measure while CFR amendments are made to help domestic producers be competitive in their own market.

Competition and Development

Tidewater has experienced the challenges of competing with imported American fuels firsthand, according to Baines. Completed in 2023 and operating starting in the first quarter of 2024, the facility produces 3,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel. Baines emphasizes that his team is “confident” that their company provides the lowest-cost fuel to its market. “We should be very competitive, and when you have all these imports coming in, really cratering the market and [in] our trade case, the numbers suggested dumped,” says Baines. “It’s not even just at parity price; it’s like they’re [sending] it into our market then we need Canada … to respond or lose that economic activity.”

Baines says historical imports of renewable diesel to British Columbia—Tidewater Renewables’ primary market—doubled from 2022 to 2023 and doubled again from 2023 to 2024. He explains that although Tidewater’s renewable diesel has the lowest delivered cost in B.C., imports are cratering the market, making it difficult to sell the fuel. “We basically had a very unlevel, unfair playing field where you had all this subsidized product that was being moved to Canada,” Baines says.

Tidewater Renewables uses tallow and used cooking oil alongside its primary feedstock, canola oil. Baines explains that Canadian farmers produce roughly 21 million metric tons of canola seed, 6 million tons of which is exported, with 50% to 70% historically going to China. Canada crushes about 15 million tons of canola, sending about 4.9 million tons of canola oil to the U.S. “A huge portion of that goes into the U.S. biofuels industry,” Baines says. “And then it’s been recycled back across the border as the U.S. biofuels have been imported into Canada. So, what do we need to do to find a new domestic sink? It’s really value-added manufacturing, more biofuels.”

A Level Playing Field

The BPI could help level the playing field for Canadian biofuel producers, but Baines is waiting for the final ruling to see what tangible impact the incentive and CFR amendments will have. The province of British Columbia, where Tidewater is located, has been receiving significant volumes of fuel from U.S. producers. The province did increase the required percentage of domestically produced biofuels in its fuel supply, and Baines says he has seen some small benefits to his business from the change.

A “North American ring fence” made up of policies that favor regionally produced feedstocks could help create market diversification opportunities for farmers in both the U.S. and Canada, Vervaet says. “We actually think that makes a lot of sense, and we believe something like that could be in scope for these targeted amendments and could go a long way ensuring that as biofuel production grows in Canada, we see canola’s utilization grow in lockstep.”

Expanding domestic renewable diesel is a strong start toward creating a sink for canola oil, but Baines sees sustainable aviation fuel as the next step. He would like to see the government encourage development of this type of value-added manufacturing rather than relying on exporting canola seed in raw form.

Prioritizing domestic production is a key component of the strategy needed for Canada to follow through on its international decarbonization commitments. Although the government is taking important steps toward developing domestic infrastructure projects—something Ghatala emphasizes is important—the biofuels industry must not be overlooked. “If we’ve all affirmed our commitment to the Belém 4X pledge, it’s essential that we’re able to expand our renewable fuel demand, and we can’t expand demand unless we have viable supply,” he says. “The BPI is helping.”

Airlines in Europe report paying up to five times the cost of conventional jet fuel and double prevailing market prices for SAF, without guaranteed availability or documentation.
Airlines globally are expected to pay a USD 2.9 billion premium for the 1.9 Mt of SAF available in 2025.
IATA cautions that current policy structures could repeat existing problems, as e-SAF carries an even higher production cost—potentially up to twelve times that of conventional jet fuel.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has issued updated projections for global Sustainable Aviation Fuel output, revealing slower near-term growth and signalling wider concerns about policy structures in major mandated regions. IATA now expects 1.9 million tonnes (Mt) of SAF to be produced in 2025, equivalent to 2.4 billion litres and double the estimated 1 Mt produced in 2024.

Output in 2026 is forecast to reach 2.4 Mt, marking a deceleration relative to previous expectations.

Despite this increase, SAF volumes remain a small proportion of aviation’s fuel demand.

Production in 2025 is projected to account for just 0.6 per cent of global jet fuel consumption, rising marginally to 0.8 per cent the following year.

At prevailing prices, this gap adds substantially to operating costs. IATA calculates a SAF premium of USD 3.6 billion for the airline sector in 2025.

Capacity constraints and policy challenges

IATA’s revised 2025 estimate represents a downward adjustment from earlier forecasts.

The association cites insufficient policy incentives, particularly in mandated markets, to utilise existing capacity fully and stimulate further investment.

SAF prices currently exceed those of fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, rising to as much as five times higher in regions with mandatory blending obligations.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said, “SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry… they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work.”

Problems in Europe and the UK

IATA highlights the impact of ReFuelEU Aviation, arguing that limited supply options and concentrated supplier power have pushed prices to unsustainable levels.

Airlines in Europe report paying up to five times the cost of conventional jet fuel and double prevailing market prices for SAF, without guaranteed availability or documentation.

The UK’s mandate has led to similar price spikes, forcing carriers to absorb additional costs.

Airlines globally are expected to pay a USD 2.9 billion premium for the 1.9 Mt of SAF available in 2025.

Of this total, USD 1.4 billion is attributable to the baseline price difference between SAF and kerosene.

Walsh warned that uneven and fragmented regulation is deterring investment.

He added that many airline commitments, including targets to use 10 per cent SAF by 2030, may need to be reassessed due to the lack of available supply.

Preparing for e-SAF requirements

Attention is now turning to forthcoming e-SAF mandates in the UK from 2028 and the EU from 2030.

IATA cautions that current policy structures could repeat existing problems, as e-SAF carries an even higher production cost—potentially up to twelve times that of conventional jet fuel.

Without incentive-led frameworks, production volumes are unlikely to meet mandated levels, and compliance costs could reach EUR 29 billion by 2032.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/12/10/neste_sustainable_aviation_fuel_-_tunker_truck_at_airport_1.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 02:57:08.602619

The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market is gaining significant momentum, driven by airlines and regulations striving for lower emissions compared to traditional jet fuel. As we step into new regulatory environments favoring sustainability, the market is projected to soar, aiming for remarkable figures by 2035. Forecasts indicate that the market will reach an impressive USD 357.41 billion while experiencing a staggering compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 65.56% between 2026 and 2035.

Understanding What Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Is

Sustainable aviation fuel is an innovative type of biofuel created from renewable and waste feedstocks. It aligns perfectly with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure, providing a viable alternative to conventional jet fuel. The growing demand is primarily attributed to its ability to slash emissions significantly. With supportive policies and increased investments in advanced bio-refineries, airlines are gradually transitioning toward SAF, making commercial aviation the leading consumer.

Key Highlights of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market

Recent analyses highlight significant trends and segmentation across various categories:

In terms of geography, North America holds the upper hand, commanding over 47.11% of the market share in 2025.

When considering feedstock sources, vegetable oils account for about 36.11% share, reflecting their critical role in SAF production.

The hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology stands out, representing 41.23% of the market share in 2025, showcasing its reliability and maturity.

In application, commercial aviation utilizes SAF the most, with a reported revenue share of 71.09%, while private and business aviation is expected to exhibit growth due to emerging demand.

The direct sales channel to airlines dominates the distribution landscape, indicating a focus on long-term partnerships for steady fuel supply.

The Environmental Benefits of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

One of the most substantial advantages of SAF over fossil fuels lies in its emission reduction capabilities. A life cycle analysis reveals that SAF can lead to a remarkable 87% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions when compared to traditional jet fuels. Also, reductions in particulates and sulfur emissions are reported at rates of 91% and 100%, respectively, marking SAF as a crucial player in the fight against climate change.

Innovative Production Techniques of SAF

The production of sustainable aviation fuels is on an upward trajectory, leveraging various feedstocks like food waste, woody biomass, and waste oils—representing a promising avenue for renewable energy.

Pathways to SAF Production

Here’s a brief overview of the key production pathways:

Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA): This technology enables efficient conversion of triglyceride feedstocks into high-quality SAF, sustaining compliance with stringent aviation standards.

Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis: This process transforms various renewable feedstocks, including agricultural residues, into high-purity fuels that align well with global decarbonization efforts.

Alcohol-to-Jet Pathway: It involves converting alcohol derived from sustainable materials into jet fuel, further expanding the feedstock base while maintaining economic feasibility.

The Future Landscape of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

With resources readily available for SAF production, such as corn grain, oils, and other fats, the U.S. Department of Energy argues the potential for tripling biomass output to more than 1 billion tons annually. Such advancements in biomass utilization present opportunities to meet aviation needs while nurturing the environment.

The domestic market is set for expansion, increasing job opportunities within rural communities and improving sustainability practices across multiple sectors. The integration of AI and technology is poised to enhance innovation within the industry, streamlining processes from feedstock selection to production optimization.

Government Initiatives Supporting SAF Development

Numerous strategic initiatives designed to bolster the growth of the SAF market are underway:

The ReFuelEU Aviation Initiative: A policy requiring fuel suppliers to blend a minimum of 2% SAF into traditional fuels by 2025, with a target of 70% by 2050.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge: A commitment by the U.S. to ramp up domestic SAF production to 3 billion gallons by 2030.

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA): Implementing production tax credits to support clean fuel initiatives, including SAF projects.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry.
The failure to accelerate the expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets.
“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect.
Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released new estimates for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production showing that in 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (Mt) (2.4 billion literers), double the 1 Mt produced in 2024. However, in 2026, SAF production growth is projected to slow down and reach 2.4 Mt.

VIEWPOINT: Net zero by 2050 — Fuhgeddaboudit

SAF production in 2025 represents only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption, increasing to 0.8% the following year. At current price levels, the SAF premium translates into an additional USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs for the industry in 2025. The estimated SAF output for 2025 of 1.9 Mt is a downward revision from IATA’s earlier forecasts due to lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities. SAF prices exceed fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to a factor of five in mandated markets.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonisation of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

IATA also said mandates in the EU and UK have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption. In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have widened their profit margins to such an extent that airlines pay up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF. All this comes without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation. The UK’s SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden.

The cumulative impact of poorly designed policy frameworks is that airlines paid a premium of USD 2.9 billion for the limited 1.9 Mt of SAF available in 2025. Of this, USD 1.4 billion reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional fuel, IATA said.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognize that its approach is not working and urgently correct course. The recent European Commission STIP announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter,” said Walsh.

The failure to accelerate the expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets. “Regrettably many airlines that have committed to use 10 percent SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” said Walsh.

With e-SAF mandates approaching in the UK (2028) and EU (2030), it’s essential not to repeat the policy missteps seen with SAF. Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel. Without strong production incentives (as opposed to mandates), supply will fall short of targets. On top of that, compliance costs could escalate to EUR 29 billion by 2032 if targets aren’t met, as seems very likely with the current policy framework.

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect. Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down. Mandates have done just the opposite, and it is outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/Neste-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 18:56:49.990408

“Sustainable tourism strategy is essential for us”, she said.","The European Parliament hosted yesterday the conference Sustainable Tourism The Challenges of the Decade, an event organised by Portuguese MEP Sérgio Humberto.

Apostolos Tzitzikostas, the European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, opened the discussion by reminding participants of the scale of what is at stake. “Tourism is one of the most important pillars of the European economy”, he said. “Travellers spent more than three billion nights in Europe in 2024, a 50% increase compared with fifteen years ago.”

He noted that this success is powered by more than three million small businesses and 20 million workers, yet the sector is exposed to some of the most complex crises of the decade. Geopolitical instability, hybrid attacks, rising energy prices, climate shocks and pressure on infrastructure all require a new approach. “The challenges we face today are very real”, he said. “We must make sure that local communities and businesses continue to benefit from tourism.”

A historic first for Europe

In his address, the Commissioner made a striking admission. Despite the importance of tourism, Europe had never had a dedicated tourism portfolio in the European Commission and never had a common European tourism strategy.

“For a reason that I cannot understand, even though tourism brings 10% of European GDP, there was not even a Commissioner for tourism”, he said. “I am the first, and hopefully not the last.”

The strategy he will present in spring 2026 is built around three core priorities.

First, ensuring that Europe remains the world’s leading tourist destination. “We are a superpower in tourism” he said. “We have to realise that and work to maintain this position.”

Second, ensuring that the benefits of tourism are genuinely shared by local communities and businesses. This, he stressed, is essential to preventing the rise of anti tourism sentiment. “Tourism only works when communities support it.”

Third, transforming today’s pressures into opportunities by investing in innovation, digital transition, mobility and quality data. This includes creating a new European data space for tourism and strengthening destination management organisations so they can manage flows rather than simply promote destinations.

The Commissioner also highlighted a major challenge. Europe is currently missing around one million workers in tourism. Training, upskilling and talent retention must therefore be placed at the heart of the new strategy. “Sustainability is not only about the environment”, he said. “It is also about the economy, the enterprises, the infrastructure and the jobs.”

He repeatedly referred to Portugal as an example. “You are turning ambition into reality”, he told the Portuguese delegation, praising the country’s forward-looking policies, its sustainability support line and its free training programmes for tourism professionals.

Portugal’s Strategy 2035

Pedro Machado, Portugal’s Secretary of State for Tourism, Commerce and Services, explained how the national Strategy 2035 aligns with the new European vision. Portugal will present its full framework by the end of 2025, and the goal is clear. The country wants to combine stronger growth with more balanced territorial development, better data sharing and decisive climate action.

Machado described tourism as part of a “virtuous triangle” that links sustainable economic growth, territorial cohesion and climate responsibility. With an average annual growth target of 6% for the next decade, tourism could reach close to 20% of Portugal’s GDP by 2035.

Central to this approach is ensuring that communities feel the benefits of tourism. Better distribution of wealth, stronger local participation and new opportunities in low-density territories were repeatedly emphasised. “Tourism must be interpreted as a powerful instrument to compensate for the development gaps of more distant territories”, Machado said.

Climate adaptation is another pillar. Water scarcity, extreme weather and ecological stress are already affecting destinations. “We have to look at resources differently,” he said, noting that sustainability must be understood as the management of natural capital as much as the deployment of technology. Artificial intelligence can support decision-making, but only if it serves people.

Machado also stressed the vital role of mobility and connectivity for peripheral countries. Aviation remains essential for Portugal’s accessibility, and the country must work with European partners to ensure that sustainability objectives do not undermine the right to travel.

Digitalisation, innovation and artificial intelligence permeate the Strategy 2035. More than half of Portugal’s future flagship measures are technology-driven, focusing on efficiency, data and smarter services. Yet Machado insisted that technology remains a tool. “Talking about tourism is not just talking about destinations” he said. “It is talking about values and about people.”

Airlines, airports and hospitality in transition

The conference ALSO brought together Ryanair, ANA Aeroportos de Portugal and HOTREC, providing a practical dimension to the policy discussions.

Steven Fitzgerald, Director of Sustainability and Finance at Ryanair, positioned affordable connectivity as “the engine of tourism growth”. He warned that the cost of the green transition risks falling disproportionately on families and regional economies. Sustainable aviation fuel remains scarce and extremely costly, and ETS charges continue to rise. “Policies that simply make flying more expensive do not reduce emissions”, he said. “They reduce accessibility.”

He called for more European investment in the production of sustainable aviation fuel, stronger incentives and a shift away from punitive cost mechanisms.

Thierry Ligonnière, President of ANA Aeroportos de Portugal, described how connectivity has transformed the country over the last decade. Portuguese airports now handle close to 69 million passengers a year, supporting more than 21 billion euros in tourism impact. Lisbon’s airport is, however, facing a severe capacity limit, and the new airport announced for the capital region is now a priority.

Ligonnière stressed that airport growth must be compatible with environmental and social sustainability. ANA aims to reach carbon neutrality well before 2030 and has already reduced water consumption per passenger by nearly half. “There is no growth that is not sustainable”, he said.

Representing the hospitality sector, Marta Machado, Deputy Director General of HOTREC, reminded participants that 90% of tourism businesses are micro companies. They face high energy costs, digital platform pressures, labour shortages and a heavy regulatory burden. She called for better access to financing, realistic legislative timetables and stronger enforcement of EU rules on short-term rentals and online platforms. “Sustainable tourism strategy is essential for us”, she said. “It must give companies the tools to lead the green, social and digital transition.”

A strategy shaped beyond Brussels

As the conference closed, Sérgio Humberto underlined that the discussion in Brussels would not stay in the Parliament bubble. “Our objective is to bring this debate to the whole territory and beyond our borders”, he said. If the ambition expressed in the European Parliament is matched by concrete action, the coming decade could see Europe move from fragmented efforts to a coherent strategy where tourism remains a force for prosperity, sustainability and cohesion.",https://traveltomorrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-10-at-09.53.38.jpeg#163257,N,,2025-12-10 21:56:18.182312

As we look ahead to 2026, the global biofuels market is entering a period of rapid change. These shifts will be shaped by evolving policy frameworks, tightening feedstock availability, and intensifying demand from hard-to-abate sectors.

Here are the top five insights shaping the 2026 biofuels landscape.

1. Policy Tightening Around Waste Oils Will Fundamentally Reshape Feedstock Flows

Several global regions are implementing stricter rules on used cooking oil (UCO) imports and traceability. The EU’s increasing scrutiny of Asian-origin UCO, along with broader concerns about fraudulent feedstock reporting and anti-dumping rulings, is tightening compliance requirements across the board.

These changes will directly impact trade flows into Europe by raising the bar on documentation and verification. This will also put pressure on producers dependent on imported waste oils.

As these developments show, policy is no longer just a background factor in the biofuels market. It's one of the primary market drivers for 2026.

2. SAF Demand Continues Climbing, While Blending Timing is Becoming More Seasonal

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) remains one of the fastest-growing segments, driven largely by mandates and airline commitments. But the webinar highlighted an emerging pattern: buyers increasingly delay blending until the second half of the year, leading to a seasonal “catch-up” effect.

Related: UK SAF Prices Jump Over 60% as Demand Surges

This behavior is likely to persist into 2026 as buyers optimize credit positions, navigate uncertain pricing, and respond to evolving compliance rules. SAF demand will stay strong. But supply planning will become more complex and uneven through the year.

3. Renewable Diesel Markets Face Continued Volatility with Margin Pressure and Imports

Renewable diesel (HVO/RD) markets are feeling the strain from multiple factors:

Fluctuating Feedstock Prices

Uncertain Import Volumes

Tightening Renewable Fuel Standards

While demand remains resilient, margins are sensitive. And producers are paying closer attention to trade developments from the US, Asia, and the Middle East.

Expect 2026 to bring greater emphasis on flexible feedstock strategies, diversification of supply chains, and heightened sensitivity to regulatory shifts in major producing regions.

4. Biofuel Producers Will Prioritize Reliable, Scalable Feedstocks

One of the strongest themes in the webinar was that producers are shifting away from purely cost-driven feedstock procurement. Instead, they are focusing on:

Long-Term Supply Security

Robust Sustainability Documentation

Scalable Volumes Tolerant of Policy Tightening

The convergence of fraud concerns, import restrictions, and rising verification costs means that buyers are placing a premium on trusted supply partners rather than opportunistic sourcing. This shift will deepen in 2026, especially for UCO, tallow, and other key waste-based fats.

5. The Market is Preparing for a Major Cross-Commodity Scramble

SAF, e-Fuels, and renewable diesel are all competing for the same limited waste-oil and bio-intermediate pools. Accordingly, pressure across the value chain is intensifying.

The webinar noted that inter-sector competition for feedstocks is already reshaping price signals. This is particularly strong where obligations are the most prevalent, such as aviation.

This multi-sector pull on finite supplies is expected to escalate through 2026. It will place upward pressure on premium waste oils and increase the need for advanced verification and logistics solutions.

Ultimately, this convergence of demand means that producers, traders, and obligated parties will need more streamlined sourcing strategies, more transparent partnerships, and deeper biofuels market intelligence to stay ahead.

2026: Rewards Ahead for Early Planners and Adopters

The 2026 biofuels market will be shaped by the interaction of tightening policy, constrained feedstock availability, and accelerating demand from aviation and renewable diesel.

Industry players that invest early in documentation, risk management, and diversified supply chains will be better positioned to maintain compliance. Doing so will also protect their margins in a more competitive environment.

The measure follows recent federal budget changes that maintained the broader clean fuel credit but removed the SAF bonus rate.

According to the bill’s sponsors, the updated incentive structure is aimed at supporting domestic fuel production and offering additional stability for developers and agricultural suppliers.

“America is on the cusp of the next great biofuels revolution,” Rep. Mike Flood (R-NE-01) said. “The Securing America’s Fuels Act is yet another way Congress can grow our bio economy and encourage innovation that creates great jobs across rural America.”

Rep. Sharice Davids (D-KS-03) said the act is intended to ensure “clean fuel production incentives are strong and long-term so businesses, farmers, and innovators can plan for the future with confidence.”

Industry groups, including Airlines for America, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition and the National Business Aviation Association, voiced support for the bill’s introduction. The legislation arrives as SAF developers continue efforts to scale production of lower-carbon fuel that can be used with existing aircraft and infrastructure.

The forecast shows that airlines are strengthening resilience even as operating conditions remain uneven. With passenger numbers projected to reach 5.2 billion in 2026, airlines are benefiting from sustained demand and high load factors. The industry is also taking advantage of steady macroeconomic conditions, including stable GDP growth and easing inflation.

Aviation’s Profit Outlook

IATA expects operating profit to climb to USD 72.8 billion in 2026, improving from USD 67 billion in 2025 as revenues rise to USD 1.053 trillion.

The net profit per passenger is forecast at USD 7.90, which remains below the 2023 peak but aligns with 2025 results. Load factors will continue to set records, reaching 83.8% due to tight global capacity and slow aircraft deliveries.

Return on invested capital is estimated to hold at 6.8%, still short of the industry’s weighted average cost of capital.

This gap demonstrates a long-term challenge, as airlines generate high economic value yet often fail to earn returns comparable to suppliers such as engine and avionics manufacturers.

Revenue Trends in Aviation

Passenger ticket revenue is expected to rise 4.8% to USD 751 billion, supported by a nearly 5% expansion in revenue passenger kilometers.

Yields are forecast to remain stable as airlines balance demand with constrained supply. Cargo revenue is projected to reach USD 158 billion, driven by strong e-commerce flows and semiconductor shipments that continue to support AI-driven industries.

Ancillary revenue will increase to USD 145 billion, representing nearly 14% of total airline income. These gains reflect the growing role of paid add-ons, flexible travel options, and premium service upgrades across markets.

Cost Pressures

Fuel costs are expected to ease slightly to USD 252 billion in 2026 due to lower crude prices, though jet fuel will not fall as sharply because of a widening crack spread.

Non-fuel costs, however, will continue rising as labor, maintenance, and leasing expenses increase. Labor costs now account for 28% of total expenses, driven by strong wage growth and ongoing training demands.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel procurement and CORSIA-related compliance are also adding costs.

The industry expects to use 2.4 million tonnes of SAF in 2026, representing 0.8% of total fuel consumption but contributing significantly to incremental spending.

Bottom Line

The 2026 outlook confirms that airlines are entering a phase of steady, but not spectacular, profitability. This table summarizes public opinion data from an IATA survey, showing how travelers view the role of the global airline industry.

Strong demand, record load factors, and stable revenue streams are supporting margins, yet the industry still faces structural challenges, including stagnant returns on capital, supply chain bottlenecks, and rising regulatory burdens.

Despite these issues, airlines continue to deliver economic value and maintain confidence among travelers, who overwhelmingly view air travel as essential and beneficial.

That leaves an export gap of about 160 million gallons, worth an estimated $300 million for U.S. suppliers.
Malaysia has also moved to strengthen market competitiveness for U.S. ethanol.

Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade has approved a new roadmap that will expand ethanol blending across all road fuels. The plan increases national integration of ethanol to 5% (E5) and 10% (E10) blends, marking one of the most significant shifts in the country’s fuel policy in years.

The announcement follows years of technical cooperation and policy support from the U.S. Grains & BioProducts Council and USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service. Their work focused on broadening Vietnam’s ethanol mandate and lowering tariff barriers for U.S. exports.

Beginning in January, fuel distributors in Vietnam will start converting all RON95 gasoline—currently 80% of the market and containing no ethanol—to E10. Full compliance for RON95 is required by June 1. The remaining 20% of the market, E5 RON92, may continue until 2030, though distributors may voluntarily move to E10 earlier. All RON92 must shift to E10 by 2031.

Caleb Wurth, the Council’s regional director for Southeast Asia and Oceania, said the policy marks a turning point for U.S. producers. He noted that Vietnam’s entire gasoline pool—2.7 billion gallons annually—will now require ethanol. He said the country’s fuel ethanol demand will rise to 243 million gallons starting in June, with domestic output at roughly 84 million gallons. That leaves an export gap of about 160 million gallons, worth an estimated $300 million for U.S. suppliers.

Malaysia has also moved to strengthen market competitiveness for U.S. ethanol. Under the U.S.–Malaysia Reciprocal Trade Agreement announced in October, Malaysia has eliminated the import duty on U.S. denatured ethanol. The tariff on undenatured ethanol will be gradually reduced over nine years until it reaches zero.

Wurth said the agreement clears the way for importers and blenders in Malaysia to use denatured ethanol for future applications in gasoline, sustainable aviation fuel and marine fuels. With Malaysia consuming 4.5 billion gallons of gasoline annually—the second-largest gasoline market in Southeast Asia—he said the move represents an important step toward a cleaner energy future in the country.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ethanol-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 17:56:55.021121

SAF production will slow in 2026, according to the latest IATA forecast. Many airlines have pledged to do 10% of their flying with SAF by 2030, but that doesn't seem likely now. IATA director general Willie Walsh said on Dec. 9 at IATA's Global Media Day, ""I believe those figures are going to be impossible to achieve.""

Among the airlines that have established 10% SAF targets by 2030 are Delta, Southwest, JetBlue, Air France-KLM and the collective membership of the Oneworld alliance, which includes American, Alaska Airlines and British Airways.

Air New Zealand this year became the first global carrier to back away from a 2030 sustainability commitment, saying that a supply shortfall will make them unachievable. Walsh predicted many others will follow.

IATA projects that global SAF production this year will be 634 million gallons, nearly double last year's figure. Next year, an estimated 800 million gallons of SAF will be produced, a percentage growth of 26%.

SAF production this year will account for just 0.6% of global jet fuel consumption and will increase to an estimated 0.8% next year.

IATA has sharply opposed mandates that went into effect this year in the U.K. and EU, requiring SAF to account for 2% of fuel supply. At the IATA meeting, Walsh said large fuel producers have exploited the mandates to price gauge on SAF, which has diminished demand. IATA says prices of SAF in the U.S. are approximately five times conventional kerosene-based jet fuel. There's an additional price premium of approximately 20% in the in the EU and U.K.

The U.S. leads the world in SAF production, with upwards of 50% more production than Europe, a state of affairs that IATA attributes, at least in part, to the approach of the U.S. federal government and some U.S. states to providing tax incentives for SAF production, rather than enforcing mandates.

Congress and the Trump administration extended federal SAF incentives this year, though at a lower incentive rate than the Biden administration.

Airlines globally have committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, with 65% of the reductions to come from a ramp-up of SAF usage.

Walsh said he believes the goal is still achievable. ""I believe 2050 is still possible but getting more and more challenging,"" he said.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/TW/uploadedImages/All_TW_Art/Shutterstock_Art/2019/AirlineEmissions.jpg?n=2311&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-12-10 16:56:48.600210

This ban extends to residues and waste materials from palm oil production -- such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) -- closing loopholes that regulators feared were being used to cross-subsidize unsustainable palm production.
One critical caveat: the law bans the crediting of residues from palm oil production starting in 2027, which creates a narrow window.
""Single-counted, no more double-counting = bullish for POME because the plants will run more,"" said one Singapore-based biofuel trader, referring to palm oil mill effluent.","The German Cabinet on Dec. 10 approved a sweeping draft law to reform the country's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Quota (THG-Quote), setting an ambitious long-term trajectory to reduce fuel emissions by 59% by 2040, integrating binding Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandates, and introducing stringent new fraud prevention measures that could reshape European biofuel trade flows.

The ""Second Law for the Further Development of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Quota"" is designed to implement the EU's RED III directive and the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation into national law. It aims to provide investment security for producers of advanced biofuels and green hydrogen while cracking down on fraudulent imports that have plagued the market in recent years.

Market activity across the biofuels complex in recent weeks has been suppressed amid ongoing speculation about the expected timeline for implementing Germany's RED III bill. The German Cabinet was initially scheduled to discuss the legislation in the first week of October, with the aim of transposing it ahead of Jan. 1, 2026.

Subsequently, however, the Cabinet postponed reaching a decision on the bill week to week, amid a reported lack of consensus among the key ministries involved in drafting the bill.

As a result, the available window for the bill to pass this year through both the lower and upper houses of Germany's parliament, known respectively as the Bundestag and Bundesrat, has now become too tight. Consequently, the legislation will be passed into law in 2026, with most, but not all, policies within instructed to take effect retroactively from Jan. 1, 2026.

Ambitious quota trajectory

According to the draft text seen by S&P Global Energy, the headline GHG reduction obligation for fuel suppliers is expected to rise significantly from current levels. The law sets a fixed trajectory extending well beyond the previous 2030 horizon:

2026: 12%

2030: 25%

2035: 36%

2040: 59%

This effectively mandates a near-total decarbonization of the fuel mix by 2040, requiring a renewable energy share of approximately 62% in the transport sector.

End of double counting

The draft law confirms the elimination of the ""double counting"" mechanism for advanced biofuels. The government argues that market availability is now sufficient and that double-counting artificially inflates quota compliance without delivering real physical emissions reductions.

Additionally, the government confirmed that the double crediting of advanced biofuels will cease from Jan. 1, 2026, onwards despite the reality that the bill will not pass formally into law until later in the year.

The sub-quota for advanced biofuels, without the application of double counting, will also be raised:

2026: 2.0% (up from current mandates)

2030: 3.5%

2040: 9.0%

Crackdown on fraud and palm oil

In a direct response to recent scandals involving suspected fraudulent biofuel imports from Asia, the draft legislation introduces a ""protection of integrity"" clause. Crucially, renewable fuels will only be eligible for the quota if on-site inspections by competent authorities are permitted at the production facilities. This applies to both biofuels and Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs).

""Renewable fuels are only eligible for credit if on-site inspections by state inspectors are possible,"" the draft states, signaling a move away from reliance solely on third-party voluntary certification schemes.

Furthermore, the bill codifies the complete exclusion of palm oil-based biofuels from the quota. This ban extends to residues and waste materials from palm oil production—such as palm oil mill effluent (POME)—closing loopholes that regulators feared were being used to cross-subsidize unsustainable palm production.

That said, the draft law further stipulates that the requirement for on-site audits will only become effective from 2027 onwards, reflecting the complexity of retroactively implementing certain policies into law.

Similarly, taking effect from 2027, is the complete exclusion of palm oil-based biofuels from the quota. This ban extends to residues and waste materials from palm oil production -- such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) -- closing loopholes that regulators feared were being used to cross-subsidize unsustainable palm production. Fuels derived from palm-oil-based residues and waste will remain eligible for quota in the 2026 commitment year, however.

New RFNBO, SAF mandates, maritime excluded

For the first time, Germany is introducing a dedicated sub-quota for RFNBOs (green hydrogen and synthetic fuels) across all transport modes, replacing the previous sector-specific targets. This quota begins at 0.1% in 2026, increasing to 1.2% by 2030 and reaching 8.0% by 2040.

The use of RFNBOs will be further incentivised by a multiplier, set at 3x from 2024 onwards, 2.5x from 2037, and gradually falling to 1x by 2040.

The legislation also formally integrates the ReFuelEU Aviation mandates into German law, requiring aviation fuel suppliers to blend a minimum share of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and synthetic kerosene. Penalties for non-compliance in the aviation sector are set at steep levels to ensure enforcement: EUR 4,700 per metric ton for missing SAF volumes and EUR 17,000/mt for missing synthetic aviation fuel volumes.

Conversely, the international shipping sector will not be obligated under the RED III mandate in Germany, in contrast to plans for neighbouring market Belgium and the Netherlands.

Market impact

The reforms are expected to increase compliance costs for fuel suppliers by approximately EUR 2.7 billion in 2030. However, the Federal Ministry for the Environment (BMUKN) argues this is necessary to drive ""real"" decarbonization and spur domestic investment in electrolyzers and advanced biofuel plants.

POME (palm oil mill effluent)—historically a second-tier feedstock—becomes the marginal source. Indonesian and Malaysian producers currently banking on double-counting benefits face an immediate viability crunch unless they can ramp volumes or negotiate offtake agreements. Conversely, POME processors with existing European supply relationships expect 20%–30% price appreciation as fuel suppliers scramble for any eligible advanced feedstock to backfill the multiplier loss.

One critical caveat: the law bans the crediting of residues from palm oil production starting in 2027, which creates a narrow window. POME demand is expected to surge in 2026–27, but regulatory headwinds are anticipated to emerge thereafter. Smart traders will front-load POME commitments before the 2027 restriction becomes tighter, increasing compliance.

Market participants tracking the legislation note the move is immediately bullish for advanced feedstock demand. ""Single-counted, no more double-counting = bullish for POME because the plants will run more,"" said one Singapore-based biofuel trader, referring to palm oil mill effluent. ""The elimination of double-counting multipliers will force fuel suppliers to source substantially more actual physical biofuel volume starting mid-2026, tightening feedstock markets across Asia-Pacific.""

The draft law will now proceed to the Bundestag for parliamentary approval, with the legislative process expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026.

Biodiesel premiums increased while outright prices fell in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp hub on Dec. 9, in line with declines in gasoil markets day over day.

Market participants from UK said This has pushed up on the bio[diesel] side, mainly HVO, which of course has also pushed up UCOME retrospectively. Another said, Not [seeing an impact in the feedstock market] yet .... but RTFC is up.

FAME 0 and RME outright barge prices showed minor falls day over day, falling $2.50/mt and just 50 cents, respectively, at $1,292/mt and $1,446/mt. Meanwhile, the UCOME FOB Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp outright showed the most significant fall across flat prices at $1,442/mt, down $11.50/mt.

""All up,"" a Black-Sea based first-gen biodiesel trader said, pointing to veg oils, FAME 0 and RME. ""RSO up by Eur15,"" adding that there should be enough crop available next year to meet targets.

In premiums, the FAME 0 premium over ICE LSGO rose by $10/mt to $647/mt, while the RME premium was assessed at $12/mt higher at $801/mt. The UCOME FOB Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp premium over gasoil was assessed at $797/mt, up just $1/mt.

,,2025-12-10 18:22:40+00:00,The Straits Times,Singapore's green jet-fuel levy roll-out could boost production growth: IATA,Isabelle Liew,,,,,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/singapores-green-jet-fuel-levy-roll-out-could-boost-production-growth-iata,"He said that while he instinctively does not like levies, he is optimistic that Singapore’s approach could result in the desired outcome of stimulating production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
The levy will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing Singapore from Oct 1 that year.
Mr Walsh stressed that robust accounting measures must be in place to prevent the double counting of different types of emissions.
Scope 1 emissions are produced directly by a company’s operations while Scope 2 emissions result from its purchase of electricity.
Dr Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice-president for sustainability and chief economist, said Singapore’s SAF levy was “probably better” than a mandate.","– The roll-out of the green jet fuel levy for passengers flying out of Singapore will be closely watched to see if it can effectively stimulate production of the fuel, said the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) chief Willie Walsh.

He said that while he instinctively does not like levies, he is optimistic that Singapore’s approach could result in the desired outcome of stimulating production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The airline industry body is also watching to see if such a model can be replicated in other parts of the world, Mr Walsh said during IATA’s global media day in Geneva, Switzerland, on Dec 9. “I think we’re all looking to see what happens in Singapore because it would be great if it proved to be an effective model for stimulating the growth of production. So I remain optimistic that we will see a positive outcome from the levy,” he said.

Passengers flying out of Singapore from October 2026 will pay a levy of between $1 and $41.60 that will go towards the purchase of SAF, which is typically made from waste materials such as used cooking oil and animal fat and can cost two to five times more than traditional jet fuel.

The levy will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing Singapore from Oct 1 that year.

The SAF will be blended with traditional aviation fuel and used to refuel planes at Changi and Seletar airports. The target is for SAF to constitute 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at the two airports in 2026, with the goal of reaching 3 per cent to 5 per cent by 2030.

Mr Walsh stressed that robust accounting measures must be in place to prevent the double counting of different types of emissions.

Scope 1 emissions are produced directly by a company’s operations while Scope 2 emissions result from its purchase of electricity. Scope 3 emissions arise indirectly from a company’s supply chain, including its suppliers and customers.

Mr Walsh gave the example of a corporate customer claiming an SAF-related reduction for its Scope 3 emissions while the same reduction also counts towards an airline’s Scope 1 emissions.

If the reduction in emissions is double counted, it would undermine the credibility of these schemes, he added.

Dr Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice-president for sustainability and chief economist, said Singapore’s SAF levy was “probably better” than a mandate.

The association does not “necessarily appreciate monopoly buyers” as this removes the possibility for airlines to negotiate their own fuel purchases on their own terms, she added.

But Dr Thomsen said that as the production and adoption of SAF is not making much progress globally, IATA will “see if this (levy) can actually work” in Singapore and trust that the country will course-correct if it does not deliver the desired results.

IATA said on Dec 9 that SAF production is projected to rise to 2.4 million tonnes in 2026, constituting 0.8 per cent of total fuel consumption. In 2025, 1.9 million tonnes of such fuel is expected to be produced, slightly lower than the initial forecast of 2 million tonnes, as planned production has faltered.

Planned maintenance at major refineries, including at Finnish biofuel producer Neste’s facility in Singapore, is also temporarily reducing available supply.

Dr Thomsen said more capital should be pumped into emerging technologies to boost SAF production, such as synthetic fuels and alcohols like ethanol, as most SAF output in 2026 is expected to be made from waste materials.

On Singapore as an aviation hub, Mr Walsh said that while the country is very convenient as an intermediate point, it is becoming more expensive in terms of operational costs. He cited higher airport charges and continuing challenges in recruiting and retaining people to support the expansion of the airport and airlines as potential risks for Singapore.

Passengers and airlines at Changi Airport are

set to pay higher fees and levies in the coming years,

which will fund a $3 billion improvement plan across its four terminals and cover rising operating costs in areas such as energy and labour.

“I don’t think it’s a particular problem that we face today, but I think based on what we’re seeing, it could be a challenge for Singapore in the years ahead,” Mr Walsh said.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b1bf2b6b411a0367fb0fde089b6a807ab8a027848ec2645b0dbdea93c718d75a,N,,2025-12-10 17:57:10.208636

What do ultra-long-haul flights mean for the climate?","Taking an astonishing 29 hours, the world’s longest flight made its record-breaking debut this month.

China Eastern Airlines operates the marathon link between Shanghai and Buenos Aires, with a short stopover in Auckland.

The inaugural service departed Shanghai Pudong International Airport on 4 December. The southbound journey takes just over 25 hours, while the return to China stretches to roughly 29 hours in the prevailing winds.

Operated by a 316-seat Boeing 777-300ER, the twice-weekly service covers around 20,700 kilometres and lands at Ezeiza International Airport outside the Argentine capital.

A new ‘southbound corridor’ between three continents

China Eastern has described its new flight as a step toward creating an “Air Silk Road” connecting Asia with Oceania and South America.

Around 55,000 Chinese nationals live in Argentina, making it a key market for the airline.

Prices range from €1,320 to €1,950 in economy to about €4,200 for business class.

The carrier says the new “southbound corridor” links opposite ends of the Pacific and strengthens travel options between three continents.

What are the world’s longest flights?

The flight also reflects how rapidly ultra-long-haul travel is expanding. Powered by lighter aircraft and better fuel efficiency, airlines are seeking direct links between far-flung regions – even, as China Eastern puts it, “antipodal” destinations.

The new journey joins a small but growing group of ultra-long-haul routes already in the skies.

Singapore Airlines currently operates the longest non-stop service, connecting Singapore and New York’s JFK Airport.

The eastbound and return flight last about 18 hours and are flown in an ultra-long-range Airbus A350, a type of plane that can remain airborne for nearly 18,000 kilometres. The airline also offers a slightly shorter Singapore-Newark service.

Other airlines maintain routes that regularly exceed 15 hours. Qatar Airways links Doha and Auckland, while Qantas operates two major long-hauls: Perth to London Heathrow and Melbourne to Dallas Fort Worth.

All fall within the ultra-long-haul category, defined as flights lasting 16 hours or more.

Ultra-long-haul flights: What’s next for air travel?

Soon, travellers unbothered by extremes can take even lengthier journeys.

Qantas plans to introduce its ‘Project Sunrise’ routes either in late 2026 or 2027. Using specially configured Airbus A350-1000s fitted with additional fuel tanks, Qantas will offer non-stop flights from Sydney to London and Sydney to New York, with journey times expected to range between 19 and 22 hours.

The aircraft are due for delivery in October 2026, with Sydney-London expected to be the first departure.

Other long-haul additions are also planned for 2026, although China Eastern’s eye-reddening journey is likely to be the only one long enough to watch an entire season of your favourite show.

Etihad will introduce a new Abu Dhabi-Charlotte service in May, expanding its US network with near-15-hour flights. Delta is set to launch its first nonstop route between Atlanta and Riyadh in late 2026.

Meanwhile, Ireland’s Aer Lingus will expand its transatlantic network with a new Dublin-Raleigh Durham route and British Airways is adding extra flights to Miami and Bangkok and reopening seasonal links to Jamaica.

What do ultra-long-haul flights mean for the climate?

This upward trend may tickle travellers fascinated by the experience of flying, but it’s bad news for the climate.

Taking one long-haul flight generates more carbon emissions than many people around the world produce in a whole year – and more than an average European emits with heating their home and eating – according to campaign group Stay Grounded.",https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/57/82/05/1200x675_cmsv2_985eb726-c387-5432-aca9-a97d9bdfd112-9578205.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 12:57:37.664292

AI-driven personalization is redefining the passenger experience. For decades, flying was largely transactional – moving travelers efficiently from point A to point B. Today, airlines recognize the economic and experiential value of tailoring offers and services to individual preferences and travel contexts.

AI-driven personalization now spans dynamic pricing, targeted promotions, in-flight entertainment, loyalty engagement, and real-time chatbots. The goal is clear: increase satisfaction and yield by aligning experiences with each traveler’s unique profile. Leading carriers such as Lufthansa, Delta, and JetBlue are already deploying advanced data platforms that connect digital, operational, and service touchpoints to create seamless journeys.

Yet this growing intimacy comes with a dual challenge. On one hand, AI enables unprecedented understanding of traveler behavior. On the other, it risks eroding privacy and trust when data is over-collected, shared with partners, or monetized externally. The core dilemma is how to personalize responsibly while maintaining profitability in an industry of thin margins and price-sensitive customers.

Balancing privacy and profitability

Running an effective personalization program means reconciling two opposing forces: protecting customer privacy and maximizing revenue. Regulations such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) impose strict limits on profiling and automated decision-making.

Meanwhile, airlines must still compete on differentiated offers and personalized pricing.Traditional ‘segment of one’ personalization often relies on detailed user profiles – precisely what GDPR seeks to limit. Overly individualized targeting risks breaching principles of transparency, purpose limitation, and data minimization. Conversely, cautious approaches can dilute marketing precision and revenue potential.

Quad Advisory’s Personalized AI (PAI) system offers a solution grounded in optimization and privacy. Drawing on deep revenue-management expertise, it balances personalization depth with responsible data design through a framework built on multidimensional microsegments.

Microsegments: Contextual personalization without intrusion

A key principle of the PAI system is that personalization does not require knowing every traveler individually. Instead, it organizes passengers into microsegments – groups of travelers with similar behavioral and contextual attributes – while anonymizing identities. Each microsegment integrates both customer features (purpose of travel, purchase behavior, seasonality) and airline features (route, market, channel, point of sale, agent, competition, Equipment).

This dual-lens approach enables demand forecasting and dynamic pricing that reflect both customer intent and profit optimization. For example, two passengers with similar demographics might belong to different microsegments if they travel in distinct markets such as the US and Europe, where pricing dynamics diverge. Likewise, a business traveler may shift segments when booking a short domestic trip versus an international family vacation.

At the computational level, each microsegment is powered by tensor-based AI models, enabling rapid processing of large datasets while preserving privacy. The system continuously learns from new data, adjusting forecasts and recommendations without referencing personal identifiers. This design delivers contextual accuracy – ‘personalization with privacy.’

A major Asian carrier, for example, used the PAI system to unify its domestic and international pricing and sales promotion models. By clustering routes into 500 microsegments instead of millions of individual profiles, it increased total revenue while running promotions and price cuts in critical microsegments – a demonstration that discounts and revenue increase can coexist when personalization is mathematically structured.

Aligning short-term revenue with long-term loyalty

Effective personalization must serve two key objectives: near-term yield and long-term loyalty. The PAI system enables airlines to set optimization goals for each microsegment— maximizing revenue in some while emphasizing retention or share growth in others.

Quad’s research identifies multiple strategic personalization scenarios, ranging from high-impact revenue opportunities to cases that demand product or pricing redesign. By classifying microsegments into these scenarios, the PAI system ensures that marketing and pricing efforts focus where personalization delivers the greatest economic and experiential value.

Enterprise-wide Personalization

A defining feature of Quad’s approach is consistency across the organization.

Insights derived from microsegments inform both strategic and operational decisions:

Executives use them to shape revenue and loyalty strategies.

Marketing and pricing teams apply them to campaigns and dynamic offers.

Frontline agents rely on them for tailored upgrades or service recovery gestures.

This vertical integration ensures that personalization is not confined to marketing but is embedded across all customer touchpoints.

Agentic AI: the new frontier and its risks A new wave of Agentic AI – autonomous systems capable of executing complex commercial actions – is beginning to transform airline operations. Agentic AI can autonomously manage offers, bookings, and service recovery, dynamically adjusting prices or even completing reservations on behalf of travelers. While this autonomy promises efficiency and speed, it introduces new risks, including opaque decision-making, unintended biases, privacy exposure, and suboptimal financial outcomes if not properly constrained.

Unsupervised or heuristic-driven agentic systems may prioritize short-term conversion over long-term profitability or compliance. To counter this, Quad’s PAI system embeds quantitative optimization layers that bound agentic actions within measurable, profit-driven, and policy-compliant limits. By integrating mathematical rigor and interpretability into autonomous personalization, it ensures that AI agents act within quantifiable business and ethical constraints – protecting both traveler privacy and airline revenue integrity.

The regulatory dimension: ethical AI in aviation

AI-based personalization can easily cross regulatory lines if implemented without transparency or consent. Large language models (LLMs), increasingly used for conversational and recommendation interfaces, intensify the risk. These models can infer sensitive traits such as health status or behavioral tendencies, even from minimal data.

As airlines adopt autonomous and agentic AI for pricing, disruption management, and service automation, maintaining data protection by design is crucial. Decisions about how much autonomy to grant AI systems – and how much transparency to enforce – will define the next generation of responsible personalization.Compliance with GDPR and similar frameworks is not optional; it is the foundation of digital trust. A futuristic system such as Quad’s PAI system balances customer preferences, competitive drives, privacy, regulatory constraints and profits responsibly through proper governance.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/iStock-2204673311-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 13:56:47.889162

The study, Enabling Hydrogen in the European Aviation Market, found that hydrogen in aviation offers a unique opportunity to achieve both emissions reduction and market expansion. The analysis shows that introducing hydrogen alongside Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can accelerate progress towards net zero, particularly when policy incentives reward low-carbon fuels and if hydrogen were to be included within the EU’s SAF mandate1.

Further modelling indicates that the earlier novel technologies, such as hydrogen, can be introduced, the more opportunity they present for CO2 emission reductions, underscoring the value of early technological transition where it is financially and technically viable.

The study is underpinned by UCL ATSLab’s Airline Behaviour Model (ABM), which represents the complexity of airline decision-making through specific behavioural variables. Building on this, the research evaluates how fuel costs, incentives and new technologies shape airline responses. This provides a research-based, realistic picture of how hydrogen adoption could evolve, highlighting both opportunities and potential challenges for adoption.

Prof. Hervé Morvan, Chief of Future Platforms, Group R&T, Rolls-Royce, says: While our immediate opportunities lie with increased engine efficiency and SAF adoption, by continuing the industry’s development of hydrogen propulsion and strategic infrastructure investment, we stand to achieve net-zero faster while protecting the vital economic benefits that aviation brings. This research demonstrates hydrogen’s potential to deliver substantial emissions reductions and growth advantages as part of a diverse long term technology strategy.”

Lahiru Ranasinghe, Director of Sustainability, easyJet, says: This study outlines the importance of hydrogen as one of the solutions that can help accelerate decarbonisation and support economic growth at the same time. There are many technological and infrastructure challenges to overcome, however we continue to see progress and we remain committed to playing an active role on this journey.”

Matt Gorman, Director of Carbon Strategy, Heathrow, says: It’s exciting to see the study confirm how hydrogen infrastructure at a small number of major airports could deliver most of the carbon benefits of hydrogen aircraft adoption. At Heathrow, we’re preparing to support multiple measures to address aviation emissions, ensuring safe and effective adoption as soon as these technologies arrive.”

Dr Khan Doyme, Senior Research Fellow, Air Transportation Systems Lab, says: Our modelling shows that hydrogen and SAF together can deliver both sector growth and decarbonisation.

What are the benefits of SAF compared to fossil jet fuel?

Based on our own Life Cycle Analysis, a specific batch of SAF can reduce emissions around 87%, compared to fossil jet fuel over its entire life span. This includes production, distribution, transportation and combustion. It can also reduce other harmful emissions like particulates and sulfur by 91% and 100% respectively. These reductions are critical ways to reduce the impact of climate change on our planet.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Outlook 2025

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Market Outlook, developed in close collaboration with ICF today. This year’s edition highlights both the progress made and the important steps still needed to ensure a resilient, scalable SAF industry capable of meeting long-term decarbonization goals.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Production

SAF can be produced from non-petroleum-based renewable feedstocks including, but not limited to, the food and yard waste portion of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, fats/greases/oils, and other feedstocks. SAF production is in its early stages, with three known commercial producers:

World Energy began SAF production in 2016 at its Paramount, California, facility and initially supplied fuel to Los Angeles International Airport prior to supplying additional California airports.

International producer Neste began supplying SAF to San Francisco International Airport in 2020 before expanding to other California airports in 2021 and 2022, as well as Aspen/Pitkin County Airport and Telluride Regional Airport, both in Colorado.

Montana Renewables LLC began production in partnership with Shell at an existing petroleum production plant in 2023, supplying fuel to several partner airlines.

Additional new domestic plants are expected. Many airlines have signed agreements with existing and future SAF producers to use all their expected output. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) collects renewable fuel data as part of the Renewable Fuel Standard, which provides an approximate consumption for novel biofuels such as SAF. EPA's data show that approximately 5 million gallons of SAF were consumed in 2021, 15.84 million gallons in 2022, and 24.5 million gallons in 2023.

There are multiple technology pathways to produce fuels approved by ASTM and blending limitations based on these pathways. ASTM D7566 Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons dictates fuel quality standards for non-petroleum-based jet fuel and outlines approved SAF-based fuels and the percent allowable in a blend with Jet A. All three existing plants use the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids pathway shown in the table on this page. New domestic plants using the alcohol-to-jet pathway with ethanol as a feedstock are expected. ASTM D1655 Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuels allows co-processing of biomass feedstocks at a petroleum refinery in blends up to 5%.

Both ASTM standards are continuously updated to allow for advancements in technology to produce SAF. DOE's Sustainable Aviation Fuel Review of Technical Pathways provides details on various SAF production pathways. The pathways below represent only those currently approved by ASTM. Processes and tests exist for the approval of other feedstocks, fuel molecules, and blending limits, and the types of approved fuels will increase as these are evaluated through this process.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Safe, Reliable, Low Carbon

SAF is a biofuel used to power aircraft that has similar properties to conventional jet fuel but with a smaller carbon footprint. Depending on the feedstock and technologies used to produce it, SAF can reduce emissions dramatically compared to conventional jet fuel. Some emerging SAF pathways even have a net-negative emissions footprint.

SAFs lower carbon intensity makes it an important solution for reducing emissions, which make up 9%–12% of U.S. transportation emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

A Menu of Feedstocks for Producing SAF

The U.S. Department of Energy’s 2023 Billion-Ton Report: An Assessment of U.S. Renewable Carbon Resources concluded that the United States could triple its production of biomass to more than 1 billion tons per year producing an estimated 60 billion gallons of low emission liquid fuels. These resources include:

Corn grain

Oil seeds

Algae

Other fats, oils, and greases

Agricultural residues

Forestry residues

Wood mill waste

Municipal solid waste streams

Wet wastes (manures, wastewater treatment sludge)

Dedicated energy crops.

This vast resource contains enough feedstock to meet the projected fuel demand of the U.S. aviation industry, additional volumes of drop-in low carbon fuels for use in other modes of transportation, and produce high-value bioproducts and renewable chemicals.

SAF Benefits Beyond Lowering Emissions

SAF developed from a wide dispersion and variety of biomass resources will ensure that the benefits of expanded biomass production extend to both rural and urban areas. Resources, like energy crops, in a future mature market can provide more than 400 million tons of biomass per year above current uses. In addition, expanding biomass production can create new economic opportunities in agricultural and urban communities, improve the environment, and even boost aircraft performance.

Extra Revenue for Farmers

By growing biomass crops for SAF production, American farmers can earn more money during off seasons by providing feedstocks to this new market, while also securing benefits for their farms like reducing nutrient losses and improving soil quality.

Environmental Services

Biomass crops can control erosion and improve water quality and quantity. They can also increase biodiversity and store carbon in the soil, which can deliver on-farm benefits and environmental benefits across the country. Producing SAF from wet wastes, like manure and sewage sludge, reduces pollution pressure on watersheds, while also keeping potent methane gas out of the atmosphere.

Improved Aircraft Performance

Many SAFs contain fewer aromatic components, which enables them to burn cleaner in aircraft engines. This means lower local emissions of harmful compounds around airports during take-off and landing. Aromatic components are also precursors to contrails, which can exacerbate environmental impacts.

Biofuels Production Supports American Jobs

The United States is the largest producer of biofuels in the world, which contributes to our domestic economy, creates jobs, and reduces emissions.

Expanding domestic SAF production can help sustain the benefits of our biofuel industry and forge new economic benefits, creating and securing employment opportunities across the country. These include jobs in:

Feedstock production in farming communities

Construction for building cutting-edge biorefineries

Manufacturing for operating SAF biorefineries and infrastructure

Government Initiatives for the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Industry:

ReFuelEU Aviation Initiative (European Union): This policy mandates that aviation fuel suppliers at EU airports must blend a minimum share of SAF with conventional jet fuel, starting at 2% in 2025 and increasing to 70% by 2050, to create a guaranteed market and drive investment.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge (United States): A government-wide strategy to expand domestic SAF production, setting an ambitious goal of achieving 3 billion gallons per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050 to meet 100% of domestic aviation fuel demand.

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Tax Credits (United States): The IRA provides significant production tax credits (45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit) to incentivize the production of clean transportation fuels, including SAF, and help bridge the price gap with conventional jet fuel.

National SAF Blending Targets (India): India has approved indicative blending targets for SAF in aviation turbine fuel, starting with 1% by 2027, 2% by 2028, and 5% by 2030 for international flights, to promote self-reliance and decarbonization.

Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) (ICAO): This global market-based measure, established by the International Civil Aviation Organization, requires airlines to offset emissions above a set baseline from international flights, thereby creating a demand signal for SAF use.

UK SAF Mandate (United Kingdom): Similar to the EU, the UK has introduced a mandate requiring fuel suppliers to ensure a minimum proportion of the UK's aviation fuel mix is SAF, starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to 10% by 2030.

The new E5/E10 policy announcement follows multiple years of intensive support of Vietnamese government and industry stakeholders by the U.S. Grains & BioProducts Council and the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service to both migrate Vietnam’s ethanol policy to the entire gasoline pool and reduce U.S. ethanol’s tariff incidence.

Beginning in January, Vietnamese fuel distributors will begin transitioning RON95 gasoline to an E10 blend, with all RON95 gasoline required to be blended at that rate by June 1. RON95 fuel currently accounts for 80 percent of the country’s gasoline consumption and contains 0 percent ethanol, marking a sizeable rise in overall demand.

Fuel distributors will be allowed to continue selling E5 RON92, which currently accounts for 20 percent of the country’s gasoline consumption, until the end of 2030.

Leading these efforts to find solutions are general insurance companies. Keeping in mind the current importance of the very essence of insurance — security and solving social issues — Tokio Marine & Nichido is tackling the challenge of transforming the company into a corporation that goes beyond the framework of its core insurance business. These initiatives are in line with the issues addressed by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially the creation of a safe and secure society.

Extending Support for Disaster Victims That Goes Beyond Insurance

In February this year a wildfire broke out in Ofunato City, located in Japan’s northeastern prefecture of Iwate, burning about 33.7 square kilometers and damaging more than 200 buildings. In terms of the fire-damage, it was the largest forest fire since the 1970s. Peaking in early March, the number of evacuees caused by the blaze reached 4,310, a number just over 10% of the city’s population.

Relief items are critical for supporting the lives and stability of disaster victims, but matching these needs with the available aid can be difficult to manage. Accurate identification of survivor necessities is crucial, as are timely responses to changes as they occur. To this end, Tokio Marine & Nichido teamed up with Smart Supply Vision, a nonprofit organization operating a support platform that is based on citizen participation, to explore new ways of handling assistance for disaster relief.

Their system was used in Ofunato and will also be used for disasters like this. First, Tokio Marine & Nichido’s local agents in the areas concerned rely on their networks to collect information on the needs of the affected communities. The data collation also includes people who are not policyholders, and once the information is in hand it will then be registered on the platform to outline what is needed and the required quantities. Using donations received from across Japan, the essential supplies are purchased and sent to the agents who deliver them to the stricken areas. Photos of the deliveries and updates are then posted on the website so that those who donate can see the results of their contributions.

Full-scale operation started in January 2024 during the Noto Peninsula earthquake. This project seeks to emphasize the essence of insurance — mutual support — even in areas of life usually considered beyond the scope of traditional insurance.

This challenge is now extending throughout the entire Group. To support disaster prevention and mitigation, the Tokio Marine Group established Tokio Marine Resilience in 2023 and launched the all-in-one crisis management system called imatome. In the event of catastrophe, the service not only allows companies to manage employee safety and the status of business sites, but also identifies matters in need of urgent action while compiling and understanding information to enable efficient disaster responses and business continuity.

Natural disasters are not the only risks that need to be addressed. For example, take the transportation sector, where in addition to the primary challenges of preventing road accidents, companies are now required to exercise strict vehicle management oversights as well as monitoring labor conditions and health for drivers.

Tokio Marine Smart Mobility was established in 2023 to oversee these kinds of operations. It offers MIMAMO DRIVE, an automotive fleet management service for monitoring the real-time operational status of company vehicles and drivers. The system makes it simple to issue daily and monthly reports on operations using the collected data. It also allows for adding a management function to comply with mandatory alcohol checks.

In recent years, the general insurance industry has been hit by a series of issues that include price adjustments for corporate insurance premiums and information leaks. Tokio Marine & Nichido is also pursuing customer-driven reforms. True recovery can only be achieved by sincerely understanding society’s needs and responding to them with complete honesty.",https://project.nikkeibp.co.jp/ESG/atcl/eng/sdgf/94/og.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 10:56:55.154403

Disability employment is rising in Japan, supported by new national targets, training systems and flexible work-pathway programmes.

Government and local platforms now offer enhanced employer support, digital assistive tools and stronger job-matching services.

Japanese organizations are adopting inclusive hiring, tailored evaluations and workplace adjustments to integrate diverse talent.

Work is not only a means of contributing to society and the economy, it is a vital pathway to economic independence and social inclusivity. The UN SDGs call for “sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all” clearly reflects this principle. Crucially, this goal is intended for everyone, regardless of disability.

According to a 2023 report by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), approximately 11.6 million people (9.2% of the population) live with a disability. In 2024, the actual employment rate of persons with disabilities reached 2.41% in private-sector companies, 3.07% in national public institutions and 3.05% in prefectural public institutions. The private-sector employment rate has risen steadily from 1.46% in 2004 to 2.41% today, a 1.65-fold increase over 20 years. While around 30% of graduates from special needs schools enter regular employment, approximately a third use employment-related welfare services. Notably, the number transitioning from these services into private-sector jobs has increased nearly 20-fold in the same period.

Japan’s demographic challenges compound the importance of expanding inclusive employment. A July 2025 survey found that 50.8% of companies reported shortages of full-time workers, while 28.7% faced shortages of non-regular employees. Strengthening pathways for people with disabilities to enter the workforce can help mitigate these shortages while fostering more diverse corporate cultures, advancing CSR and encouraging workplace redesign through adapted accommodation.

How is the World Economic Forum promoting sustainable and inclusive mobility systems?

The World Economic Forum’s Platform for Shaping the Future of Mobility works across four industries: aerospace and drones; automotive and new mobility; aviation travel and tourism; and supply chain and transport. It aims to ensure that the future of mobility is safe, clean, and inclusive.

Through the Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition, more than 100 companies are working together to power global aviation with 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030.

In collaboration with UNICEF, the Forum developed a charter with leading shipping, airlines and logistics to support COVAX in delivering more than 1 billion COVID-19 vaccines to vulnerable communities worldwide.

The Road Freight Zero Project and P4G-Getting to Zero Coalition have led to outcomes demonstrating the rationale, costs and opportunities for accelerating the transition to zero emission freight.

The Medicine from the Sky initiative is using drones to deliver vaccines and medicine to remote areas in India, completing over 300 successful trials.

The Forum’s Target True Zero initiative is working to accelerate the deployment and scaling of zero emission aviation, leveraging electric and hydrogen flight technologies.

In collaboration with the City of Los Angeles, Federal Aviation Administration, and NASA, the Forum developed the Principles of the Urban Sky to help adopt Urban Air Mobility in cities worldwide.

The Forum led the development of the Space Sustainability Rating to incentivize and promote a more safe and sustainable approach to space mission management and debris mitigation in orbit.

The Circular Cars Initiative is informing the automotive circularity policy agenda, following the endorsement from European Commission and Zero Emission Vehicle Transition Council countries, and is now invited to support China’s policy roadmap.

The Moving India network is working with policymakers to advance electric vehicle manufacturing policies, ignite adoption of zero emission road freight vehicles, and finance the transition.

The Urban Mobility Scorecards initiative – led by the Forum’s Global New Mobility Coalition – is bringing together mobility operators and cities to benchmark the transition to sustainable urban mobility systems.

Government initiatives to expand disability employment

In January 2023, MHLW announced plans to raise the statutory employment rate of private-sector companies for persons with disabilities from 2.5% to 2.7% by FY 2026. The target has already increased in stages, from 2.3% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2024, with a further rise to 2.7% scheduled.

In October 2025, a new nationwide Employment Choice Support programme was launched, strengthening systems that help individuals select work arrangements that suit their abilities and aspirations. The programme is expected to expand career options and improve job retention, while promoting more flexible pathways to work.

In November 2025, MHLW proposed revising the criteria of the “Monisu” certification programme, originally created to promote disability employment in SMEs and extending eligibility to large corporations. Established in 2020, the scheme provides certified SMEs with access to low-interest financing, with 545 certified companies as of June 2024. Current discussions focus on improving objectivity in evaluation criteria, introducing mandatory requirements and balancing corporate burdens through levies and incentive schemes.

Strengthening support for employers

Support systems for employers are also evolving. In August 2025, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government launched the Severe Disability Employment Support platform, providing practical information and services to jobseekers and companies. The platform connects individuals with severe disabilities to support organizations employers. It also shares case studies and introduces digital assistive technologies tailored to different types of disabilities including eye-tracking input systems and chin-controlled device. It deploys specialized coordinators to support job matching and workplace adjustments.

Japan’s Organization for Employment of the Elderly, Persons with Disabilities and Job Seekers (JEED) offers foundational training programmes for professionals working in disability employment support across the welfare, education and healthcare sectors. It aims to strengthen the skills and capacity of those who support jobseekers.

Expanding corporate engagement in disability employment

Momentum is also building in the private sector. Sony Group has pursued a recruitment policy based on the principle of hiring “people who can work together with Sony,” regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation or disability status. Many employees with disabilities work as full-time employees. Recognizing diversity as a driver of innovation, Sony promotes inclusion through four pillars: leadership commitment, peer awareness, employee self-empowerment and workplace infrastructure developed by HR and general affairs.

Money Forward, a cloud-based accounting software company, has introduced a tailored performance evaluation system for employees with disabilities. New hires start on fixed-term contracts focused on integration and retention, before transiting to productivity-based evaluation as permanent employees. Opportunities to transition into general career-track roles are supported by performance-based management with appropriate accommodation. At Sumitomo Precision Products, employees with hearing impairments play an essential role in welding aircraft components, among other skilled tasks.

Building a society where everyone can work

Expanding access to work strengthens the social participation and economic independence of people with disabilities and brings diverse talent and unique perspectives into organizations. The cumulative impact of collaboration among government, business and civil society is building the foundation for a more inclusive and resilient society in which no one is left behind.

*Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a synthetic fuel.","Book and Claim is helping to promote the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) with the deployment of two H145 helicopters for EMS missions in Catalonia. This major innovation has been made possible by close collaboration between SAF Hélicoptères and Airbus.

SAF (Service Aérien Français) Hélicoptères is a long-standing operator in France. However, the acronym SAF also now stands for *Sustainable Aviation Fuel. It might be a happy coincidence that a service contract has brought the two SAFs together, but this link-up also provides a valuable lesson for the future.

“Under the terms of our service contract with the Catalan Department of Health’s Emergency Medical Services (EMS), we provide two H145 helicopters along with the pilots, technical aircrew, line maintenance and training,” explains SAF Hélicoptères co-director, Jean-Louis Camus. “These two helicopters support two hospital bases, which in turn supply the medical teams.” So far, so very traditional. What is less conventional is the environmental stipulation written into the contract signed by both parties.

“The decision to mandate Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in our RFP reflects our core value of environmental responsibility,” stresses Juan Carlos Gomez Herrera, from the Catalan administration. “It’s a natural extension of our duty to promote public health – not only through immediate medical care, but also by reducing long-term environmental impacts.”

SAF Hélicoptères responded to this requirement by taking advantage of the *Book and Claim system in cooperation with Airbus Helicopters. But what does it actually entail?

Understanding Book and Claim

Using SAF requires the fuel to be made available at a given airfield, by means of pipelines or tankers. While the logistics are perfectly possible for a major airport, they remain out of reach for a small hospital helipad. Therefore, instead of promoting the fuel by using it directly, the system requires payment to be made for a specific production volume. The fuel itself is then consumed by another operator. “In my contract, I state that I will pay the equivalent of a portion of my helicopters’ fuel usage in exchange for a certificate,” summarises Jean-Louis Camus. “But what sounds like a simple solution on paper is actually quite complex to implement.”

This assessment is backed up by Laurie Ceccan, who is responsible for Book and Claim at Airbus Helicopters. “In the short term, SAF is the key component in our plans to decarbonise aviation. We have therefore invested a lot of time and effort in this system, in which Airbus acts as a facilitator. We source SAF certificates at the best price through direct calls for tenders from producers. Then we work with the platform provided by our partner RSB to manage and transfer these certificates to our clients. The process is totally transparent for the operator and the end user of the helicopters. Ultimately, the convergence of everyone’s goodwill allows us to achieve this solution.”

This collaboration has allowed us to see how the Book and Claim system can provide traceable, verifiable SAF benefits, even where direct physical supply is not feasible,” notes Juan Carlos Gomez Herrera. “The SAF certification system implemented by RSB and supported by Airbus provides the independent verification, traceability and compliance we require to ensure credibility. This rigorous validation guarantees that the SAF attributes we purchase translate into real, measurable carbon reductions – consistent with our ethical code’s emphasis on honesty, accountability and sustainability.”

Catalonia’s ambition is now to strengthen its requirements for SAF in future calls for tender. At SAF Hélicoptères, there is a readiness to extend Book and Claim to other applications. For its part, Airbus Helicopters is promoting the scenario to its clients. It seems the stars are aligning to give SAF its rightful place in the world of rotary wing aviation.

About SAF Hélicoptères

SAF Hélicoptères is a major player in the French and international helicopter world, going back more than 40 years. Three service lines have dominated the group’s activities from the outset: medical evacuation and HEMS, firefighting, and humanitarian missions. Today, SAF employs 600 people with a global fleet of more than 100 helicopters based at some 40 locations around the world.

SAF was the first private operator of the H145 and currently has seven of the type in service, including the two in Catalonia. It also operates 20 H125s, 21 H135s and seven Super Pumas.

About Emergency Medical Services (EMS): Helicopters serving the Catalan people

Covering an area of 32,108 km² and with a population of over eight million, Catalonia’s geography makes the helicopter an essential mode of transport for emergency services in the most tricky-to-access areas. With four bases at its disposal, Catalonia can guarantee a response time of under 30 minutes in 90% of cases. Around 3,000 missions are flown every year, resulting in a total of 2,000 flight hours. Some 85% of the activities involve emergency evacuations, while the remaining 15% relate to inter-hospital transfer flights.

*Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a synthetic fuel. In order to be considered sustainable, it must be made from renewable sources or feedstocks, such as used cooking oils, fats, plant oils, municipal, agricultural and forestry waste. It must also meet a set of stringent sustainability requirements including regulations set by ICAO’s CORSIA scheme and the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED). These requirements include food security, water management and human rights considerations. For example, SAF certification bodies independently verify that feedstocks for SAF do not divert resources needed for food production.",https://mediaassets.airbus.com/medias/domain38/media102583/775008-qmnr2ind43-preview.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 08:56:34.894324

Sustainable aviation fuel will help lower emissions while expanding domestic markets for our nation’s farmers, ensuring that our ag economy thrives for generations to come.
“Sustainable aviation fuel is an exciting, new green fuel that’s creating jobs in Louisiana and driving demand for American agricultural products.
“The SAF Coalition applauds Reps. Sharice Davids and Mike Flood for their leadership in introducing The Securing America’s Fuels Act,” said Alison Graab, Executive Director, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Coalition.","U.S. Representative Sharice Davids (D-KS-03) alongside Representatives Mike Flood (R-NE-01), Troy Carter (D-LA-02), and Tracey Mann (R-KS-01) introduced the Securing America’s Fuels (SAF) Act, bipartisan legislation designed to strengthen the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry, create economic opportunities for farmers, and reduce emissions in the transportation sector.

“Investing in sustainable aviation fuel isn’t just good for the environment it’s good for Kansas farmers, our communities, and our economy,” said Davids. “The SAF Act ensures that clean fuel production incentives are strong and long-term so businesses, farmers, and innovators can plan for the future with confidence. The bipartisan support shows the incredible potential we have to build a healthier, stronger, and more prosperous future for generations to come.”

“America is on the cusp of the next great biofuels revolution,” said Representative Mike Flood (R-NE-01). “The Securing America’s Fuels Act is yet another way Congress can grow our bio economy and encourage innovation that creates great jobs across rural America. Sustainable aviation fuel will help lower emissions while expanding domestic markets for our nation’s farmers, ensuring that our ag economy thrives for generations to come. I want to thank Congresswoman Davids for introducing this much-needed bill and look forward to working together to advance this commonsense, bipartisan bill through Congress.”

The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry currently relies on the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit to make production economically viable. While recent legislation extended the credit for all clean fuels, it eliminated the SAF-specific bonus. To address this challenge, the SAF Act would:

Reinstate the SAF bonus credit eliminated under the recent federal budget, allowing qualifying SAF producers to receive up to $0.35 or $1.75 per gallon.

Extend the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit for all clean fuels through 2033, providing long-term stability for the growing clean fuels industry.

SAF is a game-changer for local communities, agriculture, and the transportation industry. Scaling SAF to meet U.S. goals could generate 33,000 construction jobs over five years, sustain 4,500 permanent operations jobs, and support 60,000 jobs in agriculture and logistics by 2030. SAF can also reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent, delivering major environmental benefits while using existing aviation infrastructure.

""Without coordinated action between government and industry, greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase as more people and goods fly through our skies,” said Representative Troy Carter (D-LA-02). “Sustainable aviation fuel is an exciting, new green fuel that’s creating jobs in Louisiana and driving demand for American agricultural products. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to ensure America is on track to meet the growing demand for cleaner transportation and healthier communities.”

“Sustainable aviation fuel is a worthwhile investment for American agriculture and for American energy dominance,” said Representative Tracey Mann (R-KS-01). “The Securing America’s Fuels Act gives Kansas farmers the certainty they need to plan, invest, and keep supplying fuel to the country and our aviation sector. I will always support legislation that supports rural communities and helps the United States continue to lead the world in producing the fuels of tomorrow.”

Davids co-chairs the Congressional Sustainable Aviation Caucus (CSAC), which works to reduce the aviation industry’s environmental impact and maximize its financial sustainability. By leveraging federal policy, holding forums, and bringing together public and private partners, the caucus plays a key role in the integration of new technologies into the nation’s aviation network.

The demonstration, held at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley earlier this year, focused on a system called the Strategic Deconfliction Simulation, which helps coordinate flight plans before takeoff, reducing the risk of conflicts in busy urban environments

At the event, researchers demonstrated NASA’s Situational Viewer and Demand-Capacity Balancing Monitor, which visualizes air traffic and adjusts flight plans in real time. The simulation demonstrated traffic scenarios involving drone operations throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area, testing how preplanned flights could improve congestion and manage the demand and capacity of the airspace – ensuring that all aircraft can operate smoothly even in crowded conditions.

Working with industry partners is critical to NASA’s efforts to develop and refine technologies needed for future air mobility. During the simulation, the company, ANRA Technologies, demonstrated its fleet and vertiport management systems, which are designed to support the coordination of multiple aircraft and ground operations.

“Simulating these complex environments supports broader efforts to ensure safe integration of drones and other advanced vehicles into the US airspace,” said Hanbong Lee, engineer at NASA Ames. “By showcasing these capabilities, we’re delivering critical data and lessons learned to support efforts at NASA and industry.”

This demonstration is another step toward the NASA team’s plan to hold a technical capability level simulation in 2026. This upcoming simulation would help shape the development of services aimed at managing aircraft flying in urban areas.

The simulation was created through a NASA team from its Air Mobility Pathfinders project, part of the agency’s continuing work to find solutions for safely integrating innovative new aircraft such as air taxis into U.S. cities and the national airspace. By developing advanced evaluations and simulations, the project supports safe, scalable, and publicly trusted air travel in urban areas, paving the way for a future where air taxis and drones are a safe and reliable part of everyday life.

Smith, a Republican whose 3rd District covers most of the state’s agriculture footprint, said the payments are “timely,” given the impact of the trade fight.
I think it’s certainly timely,” Smith said during an interview at the Nebraska Farm Bureau annual meeting.
“Ultimately, the enforcement in a very direct and technical sense — Congress codifying trade agreements — that’s kind of the ultimate enforcement,” he said.
Smith said he expects producers to welcome the payments but remains focused on securing durable trade agreements so future farm income relies on markets rather than federal aid.","KEARNEY, Neb. — Rep. Adrian Smith says the Trump administration’s newly announced $12 billion farm aid package will help farmers absorb some of the strain from the ongoing trade war, but he cautions that long-term stability will depend on trade agreements that can be enforced regardless of who occupies the White House.

President Donald Trump unveiled the plan Monday, calling it a one-time “bridge payment” aimed mostly at row-crop producers facing high input costs and lower prices amid stalled exports to China. Since Trump reinstated tariffs shortly after taking office in January, China has sharply reduced purchases of soybeans and sorghum — two key Nebraska commodities.

Smith, a Republican whose 3rd District covers most of the state’s agriculture footprint, said the payments are “timely,” given the impact of the trade fight.

“The president’s trying to make some folks whole who have sacrificed considerably… and I want to keep an open mind. I think it’s certainly timely,” Smith said during an interview at the Nebraska Farm Bureau annual meeting.

China has signaled it will resume some soybean purchases, but Smith said U.S. officials must ensure those commitments are met.

“That’s the challenge with China… they agree to something, and yet they don’t always keep that agreement,” he said. “We’ve seen that from the first Trump administration and what China agreed to and did not follow through. So we need to stay on top of all this and all hands on deck to make sure that we keep any agreements to be enforceable.”

Smith said codifying trade agreements in Congress would give farmers more certainty and prevent reversals from future administrations.

“Ultimately, the enforcement in a very direct and technical sense — Congress codifying trade agreements — that’s kind of the ultimate enforcement,” he said.

While he said he is “not a fan of tariffs,” Smith argued they have brought some countries back to the table.

“Other countries have made concessions,” he said. “The UK, for example — they once wanted a trade agreement with nothing on agriculture. Now they’ve made concessions on beef and ethanol. That would never have happened under a Biden administration.”

The aid package, administered through USDA, is expected to make initial payments by December, with most funds released by February. Smith said he views the assistance as a temporary measure while broader market opportunities develop.

He pointed to expanded ethanol use — particularly E15 — as one area of near-term potential.

“Given corn prices where they are, more E15 availability could actually bring corn prices up a little — and save taxpayer dollars. That’s a good combination,” he said.

Smith also cited growth in Nebraska’s bioeconomy, including biodiesel and emerging sustainable aviation fuel markets, as part of the longer-term solution.

“The innovation involved in taking a kernel of corn and breaking it down into so many different things… that’s what it’s about. More options for consumers,” he said.

Steven Fitzgerald, Director of Sustainability and Finance at Ryanair, positioned affordable connectivity as “the engine of tourism growth”.
“Sustainable tourism strategy is essential for us”, she said.","The European Parliament hosted yesterday the conference Sustainable Tourism The Challenges of the Decade, an event organised by Portuguese MEP Sérgio Humberto.

Apostolos Tzitzikostas, the European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, opened the discussion by reminding participants of the scale of what is at stake. “Tourism is one of the most important pillars of the European economy”, he said. “Travellers spent more than three billion nights in Europe in 2024, a 50% increase compared with fifteen years ago.”

He noted that this success is powered by more than three million small businesses and 20 million workers, yet the sector is exposed to some of the most complex crises of the decade. Geopolitical instability, hybrid attacks, rising energy prices, climate shocks and pressure on infrastructure all require a new approach. “The challenges we face today are very real”, he said. “We must make sure that local communities and businesses continue to benefit from tourism.”

A historic first for Europe

In his address, the Commissioner made a striking admission. Despite the importance of tourism, Europe had never had a dedicated tourism portfolio in the European Commission and never had a common European tourism strategy.

“For a reason that I cannot understand, even though tourism brings 10% of European GDP, there was not even a Commissioner for tourism”, he said. “I am the first, and hopefully not the last.”

The strategy he will present in spring 2026 is built around three core priorities.

First, ensuring that Europe remains the world’s leading tourist destination. “We are a superpower in tourism” he said. “We have to realise that and work to maintain this position.”

Second, ensuring that the benefits of tourism are genuinely shared by local communities and businesses. This, he stressed, is essential to preventing the rise of anti tourism sentiment. “Tourism only works when communities support it.”

Third, transforming today’s pressures into opportunities by investing in innovation, digital transition, mobility and quality data. This includes creating a new European data space for tourism and strengthening destination management organisations so they can manage flows rather than simply promote destinations.

The Commissioner also highlighted a major challenge. Europe is currently missing around one million workers in tourism. Training, upskilling and talent retention must therefore be placed at the heart of the new strategy. “Sustainability is not only about the environment”, he said. “It is also about the economy, the enterprises, the infrastructure and the jobs.”

He repeatedly referred to Portugal as an example. “You are turning ambition into reality”, he told the Portuguese delegation, praising the country’s forward-looking policies, its sustainability support line and its free training programmes for tourism professionals.

Portugal’s Strategy 2035

Pedro Machado, Portugal’s Secretary of State for Tourism, Commerce and Services, explained how the national Strategy 2035 aligns with the new European vision. Portugal will present its full framework by the end of 2025, and the goal is clear. The country wants to combine stronger growth with more balanced territorial development, better data sharing and decisive climate action.

Machado described tourism as part of a “virtuous triangle” that links sustainable economic growth, territorial cohesion and climate responsibility. With an average annual growth target of 6% for the next decade, tourism could reach close to 20% of Portugal’s GDP by 2035.

Central to this approach is ensuring that communities feel the benefits of tourism. Better distribution of wealth, stronger local participation and new opportunities in low-density territories were repeatedly emphasised. “Tourism must be interpreted as a powerful instrument to compensate for the development gaps of more distant territories”, Machado said.

Climate adaptation is another pillar. Water scarcity, extreme weather and ecological stress are already affecting destinations. “We have to look at resources differently,” he said, noting that sustainability must be understood as the management of natural capital as much as the deployment of technology. Artificial intelligence can support decision-making, but only if it serves people.

Machado also stressed the vital role of mobility and connectivity for peripheral countries. Aviation remains essential for Portugal’s accessibility, and the country must work with European partners to ensure that sustainability objectives do not undermine the right to travel.

Digitalisation, innovation and artificial intelligence permeate the Strategy 2035. More than half of Portugal’s future flagship measures are technology-driven, focusing on efficiency, data and smarter services. Yet Machado insisted that technology remains a tool. “Talking about tourism is not just talking about destinations” he said. “It is talking about values and about people.”

Airlines, airports and hospitality in transition

The conference ALSO brought together Ryanair, ANA Aeroportos de Portugal and HOTREC, providing a practical dimension to the policy discussions.

Steven Fitzgerald, Director of Sustainability and Finance at Ryanair, positioned affordable connectivity as “the engine of tourism growth”. He warned that the cost of the green transition risks falling disproportionately on families and regional economies. Sustainable aviation fuel remains scarce and extremely costly, and ETS charges continue to rise. “Policies that simply make flying more expensive do not reduce emissions”, he said. “They reduce accessibility.”

He called for more European investment in the production of sustainable aviation fuel, stronger incentives and a shift away from punitive cost mechanisms.

Thierry Ligonnière, President of ANA Aeroportos de Portugal, described how connectivity has transformed the country over the last decade. Portuguese airports now handle close to 69 million passengers a year, supporting more than 21 billion euros in tourism impact. Lisbon’s airport is, however, facing a severe capacity limit, and the new airport announced for the capital region is now a priority.

Ligonnière stressed that airport growth must be compatible with environmental and social sustainability. ANA aims to reach carbon neutrality well before 2030 and has already reduced water consumption per passenger by nearly half. “There is no growth that is not sustainable”, he said.

Representing the hospitality sector, Marta Machado, Deputy Director General of HOTREC, reminded participants that 90% of tourism businesses are micro companies. They face high energy costs, digital platform pressures, labour shortages and a heavy regulatory burden. She called for better access to financing, realistic legislative timetables and stronger enforcement of EU rules on short-term rentals and online platforms. “Sustainable tourism strategy is essential for us”, she said. “It must give companies the tools to lead the green, social and digital transition.”

A strategy shaped beyond Brussels

As the conference closed, Sérgio Humberto underlined that the discussion in Brussels would not stay in the Parliament bubble. “Our objective is to bring this debate to the whole territory and beyond our borders”, he said. If the ambition expressed in the European Parliament is matched by concrete action, the coming decade could see Europe move from fragmented efforts to a coherent strategy where tourism remains a force for prosperity, sustainability and cohesion.",https://traveltomorrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-10-at-09.53.38.jpeg#163257,N,,2025-12-10 08:56:46.511685

The company, which currently produces SAF at its Cilacap refinery in Central Java, will be developing further facilities in South Sumatra, Riau, West Java and East Kalimantan, according to the report.

At the November COP30 climate conference in Brazil, the Indonesian government - which is aiming to increase the national SAF blending mandate for international flights to 5% by 2035 - announced a target of producing more than 1M kilolitres/year of SAF by 2030, with used cooking oil (UCO) set to be a major feedstock.

Pertamina’s Cilacap refinery has a production capacity of produce approximately 1.4M litres of SAF/day with UCO comprising around 3% of its feedstock.

The refinery converts UCO into SAF using a series of chemical processes. The oil is mixed with kerosene, heated to about 70°C and then moved into a reactor where it is heated to over 300°C and passed through layers of catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions. Hydrogen is also added to stabilise the mixture.

To boost SAF production, Pertamina was working to increase the proportion of UCO in its blends and improved catalysts were also being tested, the report said.

“Our research and development team is always trying to improve the catalyst so that the used cooking oil content can be increased to more than 3%,” process engineer Novan Adhi Prakasa was quoted as saying.

“This can also be achieved by increasing the capacity and productivity of the green refinery unit.”

IATA said that the total output of what the industry calls sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) would reach 1.9 million tonnes in 2025 – nearly double the amount produced in the previous year.
But this was a downgrade on IATA’s previous production estimate for this year of 2.1 million tonnes and it only expects alternative fuel production to reach 2.4 million tonnes in 2026.
Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general, said: “Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment and undermine efforts to scale SAF production.
The association also criticised the UK’s SAF mandate for “triggering price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden”.","The growth in the production of alternative aviation fuels is set to slow during 2026, according to airline association IATA, which blamed “poorly designed” mandates and a “lack of policy support” for declining momentum.

IATA said that the total output of what the industry calls sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) would reach 1.9 million tonnes in 2025 – nearly double the amount produced in the previous year.

But this was a downgrade on IATA’s previous production estimate for this year of 2.1 million tonnes and it only expects alternative fuel production to reach 2.4 million tonnes in 2026.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general, said: “Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognise that its approach is not working and urgently correct course.

“The recent European Commission STIP (Sustainable Transport Investment Plan) announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter.”

Walsh added that many airlines who have vowed to use 10 per cent alternative fuels by 2030 may have to “re-evaluate these commitments”.

“SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” he said.

IATA said the EU’s ReFuelEU mandate, which requires the sector to use at least 2 per cent SAF this year, had led to airlines paying “up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF”, as fuel suppliers have pushed up their prices.

The association also criticised the UK’s SAF mandate for “triggering price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden”.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/BTNE/uploadedImages/1_News/Air_Travel/Neste%20SAF%20Tanker%20truck%202024%20web.jpg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-12-10 08:57:04.258943

They argue it would have “sweeping and unintended consequences” for local healthcare, transportation, and agricultural organizations that regularly utilize high-valued aircraft for essential operations.
“General and business aviation are essential to Washington’s economy, public safety, healthcare access, agricultural success, and community connectivity,” the groups said in the letter to Ferguson.
“This coalition is intent on communicating that commitment, while also dispelling misconceptions and highlighting aviation’s positive contributions to environmental progress,” said NBAA regional director Phil Derner.
“By resetting the business aviation community’s relationship, we intend to keep legislators and the public better informed on our industry’s commitment to Washington state, its economy, and its environment,” Derner said.","The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) is stepping up its advocacy efforts in the Pacific Northwest, announcing Monday that it has brought together a new industry coalition to address the recent legislative action in Washington state that looks to levy a 10 percent tax on the sale, lease, or transfer of noncommercial aircraft valued at over $500,000.

In a news release on Monday, the association said that the new coalition is made up of state and national NBAA members, the Pacific Northwest Business Aviation Association, allied national associations, as well as local businesses and representatives across the aviation industry. The group’s stated mission for now is to provide a consolidated industry response to SB 5801, which was signed into law by Governor Bob Ferguson in May.

While the bill was awaiting the governor’s signature after passing through the state legislature in April, industry leaders—many of whom are also a part of the newly established coalition—sent a letter addressed to Ferguson’s office urging him to line-item veto the provisions in the bill related to the luxury tax. They argue it would have “sweeping and unintended consequences” for local healthcare, transportation, and agricultural organizations that regularly utilize high-valued aircraft for essential operations.

The groups said the state’s general and business aviation sectors support more than 31,000 jobs and generate $8.6 billion, in addition to 407,000 airport jobs, all of which would experience diminishing returns due to the tax.

“General and business aviation are essential to Washington’s economy, public safety, healthcare access, agricultural success, and community connectivity,” the groups said in the letter to Ferguson. “We urge you to protect these vital activities and ensure our aviation system remains strong by vetoing these harmful provisions.”

The law establishes that all revenue collected by the luxury tax on high-value aircraft will be deposited in a sustainable aviation fuel account. The NBAA stated that the tax, scheduled to go into effect on April 1, 2026, has some businesses considering whether it will be possible to remain economically viable if they are to continue operations in Washington state under the new law.

Part of the impetus, the association said, for bringing together aviation groups was because the passage of the legislation was done so with little input from the industry. So it said there remained a need for a unified voice among the larger aviation community—a void that the new group hopes to fill.

“This coalition is intent on communicating that commitment, while also dispelling misconceptions and highlighting aviation’s positive contributions to environmental progress,” said NBAA regional director Phil Derner. “We are here to build a constructive relationship that incentivizes and empowers our industry to be a better participant in sustainability and a better neighbor in communities throughout the state, not just in the big cities.”

Nearly 100 industry and community representatives gathered recently at Paine Field (KPAE) in Everett, Washington, outside Seattle to hear from state Representative Tom Dent, leader of the state’s aviation caucus and discuss needs moving forward.

“By resetting the business aviation community’s relationship, we intend to keep legislators and the public better informed on our industry’s commitment to Washington state, its economy, and its environment,” Derner said.",https://planeandpilot.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/BAI-March-April-2021-Member-Prof.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 08:57:41.950732

In the trial, HVO was derived from vegetable-origin feedstock (cashew nut shell oil) and co-processed with crude oil, while SAF was produced by processing partially refined used cooking oil alongside conventional feedstocks.

Independent laboratory analysis confirmed that both products met required fuel specifications.

MOL Group says the outcome demonstrates its readiness to scale up alternative fuel production. The trial at Slovnaft — preceded by earlier co-processing efforts at its Danube refinery — emphasises the company’s commitment to lowering emissions from diesel and jet fuels.

By showing that conventional refinery infrastructure can be adapted to produce low-carbon fuels, MOL Group aims to contribute to regional energy security and support EU decarbonisation targets. The company plans further development to enable commercial-scale output of HVO and SAF.

IATA director general Willie Walsh in a statement charged that ""poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry,"" limiting production momentum.
""If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park,"" according to Walsh.

While that would be an increase from the estimated 1.9 million metric tons produced in 2025, the growth rate would be lower than the near doubling of production from 1 million metric tons of SAF in 2024.

IATA's production estimate for 2025 is a downward revision from its June forecast of 2 million metric tons ""due to lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities,"" according to IATA.

IATA director general Willie Walsh in a statement charged that ""poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry,"" limiting production momentum.

The United Kingdom this year implemented a mandate that 2 percent of fuel used in U.K. flights must be SAF. Additionally, the European Union's ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation for 2025 requires similar SAF levels at EU airports.

""If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park,"" according to Walsh. ""But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonization of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work.""

Mandates in the EU and U.K. have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption, according to IATA. ""Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10 percent SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments,"" Walsh said. ""SAF is not being produced in efficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition.""

In addition, airlines paid $2.9 million for the SAF produced in 2025. Of this $1.4 billion reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional fuel, according to IATA.

In Europe, ReFuelEU has ""sharply increased costs"" amid limited SAF capacity and ""oligopolist supply chains,"" according to IATA, with airlines paying up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF.

""The U.K. SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden,"" IATA noted, adding that with synthetic SAF, or e-SAF, mandates approaching in the U.K. in 2028 and the EU in 2030, ""it's essential not to repeat the policy missteps seen with SAF.""

IATA Chief Economist Marie Owens Thomsen added that EU and UK blending mandates have paradoxically encouraged suppliers to raise prices further.

For Switzerland—home to major corporate flyers and two globally connected hubs—the shortfall complicates sustainability strategies. SWISS and Helvetic Airways have signed multi-year SAF purchase agreements but will struggle to secure volumes if producers cannot scale up. Travel managers fear higher ticket prices or environmental-surcharge pass-throughs just as companies face tightening ESG disclosure rules.

Sharice Davids, D-Kan.; Mike Flood, R-Neb.; Troy Carter, D-La.; and Tracey Mann, R-Kan., on Dec. 9 introduced legislation that aims to reinstate the 45Z clean fuel production credit premium for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and extend the 45Z credit through 2033.

The original 45Z tax credit, as established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provided a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels. The credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

President Trump on July 4 signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a budget reconciliation package that extended the 45Z credit through the end of 2029, altered the credit by limiting eligibility to fuels derived from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Canada or Mexico, and eliminated the “special rate” for SAF. The elimination of the “special rate” effectively caps the value of the SAF credit at $1 per gallon starting in 2026.

The SAF Act is not the only legislation introduced in recent months to reinstate the SAF bonus credit. In October, Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., introduced a bill that aims to reinstate many of the renewable energy tax credits eliminated by the OBBBA. One provision of that bill aims to reinstate the 45Z credit premium for SAF.

The bipartisan SAF Act is endorsed by major industry and agricultural groups, including National Corn Growers Association, SAF Coalition, Airlines for America, Kansas Farm Bureau, Renew Kansas, Kansas Corn, Kansas Soybean Association, Greater New Orleans Inc., Nebraska Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Soybean Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau, Twelve, Darling Ingredients, Louisiana Farm Bureau Foundation, Advanced Biofuels Association, Global Business Travel Association, and American Sugarcane League.

“The SAF Coalition applauds Reps. Sharice Davids and Mike Flood for their leadership in introducing The Securing America’s Fuels Act,” said Alison Graab, executive director, SAF Coalition. “This legislation continues the broad, bipartisan support for SAF in Congress and recognizes SAF’s unique ability to fuel America’s energy dominance while supporting American farmers. The SAF Coalition urges Congress to pass this legislation so we can grow America’s rural economies, create new markets for our farmers and secure a stronger energy future for our nation.”

“The Advanced Biofuels Association strongly supports this bipartisan effort to strengthen sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers and improve the overall availability of renewable fuels for America’s airline industry,” said Michael McAdams, president of the Advanced Biofuels Association. “This type of legislation is essential in the United States’ effort to achieve its energy dominance policy agenda.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Sharice_Davids2025_e2306b2d9d.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 21:57:13.410819

C O 2 emission reduction of sectors such as aviation, maritime shipping, road haulage, and chemical production is challenging but necessary. Although these sectors will most likely continue to rely on carbonaceous energy carriers, they are expected to gradually shift away from fossil fuels. In order to do so, the prominent option is to utilize alternative carbon sources—like biomass and C O 2 originating from carbon capture—for the production of non-fossil carbonaceous vectors (biofuels and e-fuels). However, the limited availability of biomass and the varying nature of other carbon sources necessitate a comprehensive evaluation of trade-offs between potential carbon uses and existing sources. Then, it is primordial to understand the origin of carbon used in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to understand the implications of defossilizing aviation for the energy system. Moreover, the production of SAF implies deep changes to the energy system that are quantified in this work. This study utilizes the linear programming cost optimization tool EnergyScope TD to analyze the holistic French energy system, encompassing transport, industry, electricity, and heat sectors while ensuring net greenhouse gas neutrality. A novel method to model and quantify carbon flows within the system is introduced, enabling a comprehensive assessment of greenhouse gas neutrality. This study highlights the significance of fulfilling clean energy requirements and implementing carbon dioxide removal measures as crucial steps toward achieving climate neutrality. Indeed, to reach climate neutrality, a production of 1,046 TWh of electricity by non-fossil sources is needed. Furthermore, the findings underscore the critical role of efficient carbon and energy valorization from biomass, providing evidence that producing fuels by combining biomass and hydrogen is optimal. The study also offers valuable insights into the future cost and impact of SAF production for air travel originating from France. That is, the European law ReFuelEU would increase the price of plane tickets by +33% and would require 126 TWh of hydrogen and 50 TWh of biomass to produce the necessary 91 TWh of jet fuel. Finally, the implications of the assumption behind the production of SAF are discussed.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/styles/img/transparent_logo.svg,N,,2025-12-10 05:56:58.607607
