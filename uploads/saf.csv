21 airlines pledged their support to a new initiative by the European Union’s Consumer Protection Cooperation Network, which aims to prevent passengers from being misled about a carrier’s green credentials.

Airlines are also going to stop using vague ‘green’ language or terminology without making any specific claims. There could, however, be a lot of work for airlines to undo marketing schemes that airlines have already heavily promoted.

Lufthansa, for example, has expanded its ‘Green Fares’ which promise more sustainable air travel that can “reduce 20% of individual flight-related CO₂ emissions.”

The airline’s current marketing does not explicitly point out that these fares do not apply to specific individual flights, and only recently rolled out the scheme across its worldwide route network.

Sold as completely seperate fares, consumers are told that when they buy a Business Green fare, they will be making a more sustainable choice “by using sustainable aviation fuels.”

The agency also noted that the technologies that will be used in this initiative are protected under a patent of Swung’s partner company, Kira Shoten Co. Ltd., for Bokashi fertilizer and solution.

“The PCA will continue to pursue modern technologies that can uplift the livelihood of coconut famers, as long as they undergo thorough evaluation and comply with standards,” PCA Administrator Dexter Buted said.

This follows previous talks between the PCA and Swung, where they tackled initial tests on organic fertilizers made from materials such as coconut residues, sugarcane waste and beer byproducts. The PCA is considering the next steps for the wider adoption of the technology.

Aviation fuel, too

Also, the PCA earlier said Swung was exploring venturing into coconut-based fertilizer and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), an alternative fuel produced from non-petroleum feedstocks.

Held October 28 – 30 in San Jose, California, Trellis Impact 2025 brought together three of Trellis’ core convenings, GreenFin, VERGE, and Bloom. Across the board, RMIers identified three connective threads among speakers and participants: finance, data, and transportation.

Finance

Leaders from RMI’s finance team joined peers from across different industries to discuss how the investment landscape is evolving. They found that m, corporate leaders and investors are increasingly focused on proven technologies, transparent data, and credible risk-sharing frameworks. Rather than emphasizing public campaigns and commitments, many are shifting toward delivery-focused projects and practical tools that make clean energy solutions affordable, resilient, and scalable.

RMI’s Nabil Bennouna spoke on a panel focused on exploring finance as a catalyst for corporate climate action, emphasizing that “it’s time to shift the focus from subsidies to risk management.”

“By finding creative ways to pool balance sheets and share risks, we can unlock bold investments that make entering new markets far less daunting,” Bennouna said.

RMI is putting this principle into practice in our climate finance work by building tools, guiding strategies, and connecting capital to real projects around the world.

Datacenters & AI

Discussions around AI and data centers also took center stage at Trellis Impact 2025, appearing in nearly every break-out discussion. The explosion of AI-driven tools is reshaping how companies plan, report, and execute sustainability strategies, and the opportunity is immense.

According to RMI’s John McGrath, “It was heartening to see AI conversations move beyond hype and become more pragmatic. Common themes were the need for quality data; the promises and pitfalls of technology that’s both powerful and opaque; and to what degree AI and data centers will drive load growth as improvements in AI efficiency compete with exploding usage.”

RMI is exploring AI’s role in the clean energy transition through research on data center power and energy solutions (read our most recent article ) and by building data-driven tools to advance sustainable solutions.

Transportation

Transportation solutions and innovations featured prominently in the Trellis Impact 2025 program as well.

Andrew Chen, a Principal on RMI’s Climate-Aligned Industries team, outlined how leading corporations are investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) certificates, and discussed how next-generation aircraft technologies and contrail management can help cut aviation’s full climate impact.

Chen also highlighted how the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance — spearheaded by RMI, Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), and Neoteric Energy and Climate — is building momentum for aviation climate solutions by launching a ready-to-go offering to help all attendees of COP30 address their aviation emissions.

“Purchasing SAF certificates is a tangible way to back low-carbon innovation in aviation and showcase meaningful climate leadership,” said Chen. “Forums like Trellis Impact are powerful platforms to raise visibility for these market-based tools, and we are really excited to have a growing portfolio of procurement options for corporations to play their part in aviation’s net-zero future.”

Across private conversations, keynotes, and breakout sessions, corporate leaders showed strong interest and momentum around overcoming barriers to drive progress. By the week’s end, one theme stood out from the rest: companies are deploying capital, technology, and data-driven tools morecreatively — and more cautiously —, to advance sustainable solutions while still seeking positive investment returns in parallel. Many are now focused on turning sustainability ambitions into execution, building market-based, data-backed, and technology-driven strategies that align climate goals with business performance.

The pledge cites a new report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) that envisions a quadrupling of these fuels by 2035, including a doubling of biofuel production.
Doubling biofuel production would have significant implications for the world’s land, especially without guardrails to prevent large-scale expansion of land dedicated to biofuels, which drives ecosystem loss.
At present rates of cropland expansion, an area nearly the size of India would be converted from nature to food production between 2020 and 2050.
Biofuel production on agricultural land implies trade-offs with both food production and restoring land to nature.","Belém, Brazil (November 7, 2025) — At the COP30 Leaders’ Summit, Brazil announced the Belém 4X Pledge on Sustainable Fuels, a commitment to quadruple production and use of ‘sustainable fuels’ by 2035, along with Japan, Italy, India and others. The fuels mentioned in the pledge include hydrogen, biogases, biofuels, and e-fuels.

The pledge cites a new report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) that envisions a quadrupling of these fuels by 2035, including a doubling of biofuel production.

Following is a statement from Janet Ranganathan, Managing Director of Strategy, Learning and Results, World Resources Institute:

“While countries are right to transition away from fossil fuels, they also need to ensure their plans don’t trigger unintended consequences, such as more deforestation either at home or abroad. Doubling biofuel production would have significant implications for the world’s land, especially without guardrails to prevent large-scale expansion of land dedicated to biofuels, which drives ecosystem loss.

“Already today, at least 40 million hectares of cropland are used globally to grow biofuel feedstocks, an area the size of Paraguay. And the world’s land is under pressure to provide more food and wood products for a population that will grow toward 10 billion by 2050. At present rates of cropland expansion, an area nearly the size of India would be converted from nature to food production between 2020 and 2050. Increasing biofuel mandates would create significant extra pressure for land conversion.

“WRI’s global research shows that expansion of land dedicated to biofuel production is likely to have serious negative impacts on food security, nature, and climate because it competes with food production or natural ecosystems. Biofuel production on agricultural land implies trade-offs with both food production and restoring land to nature. Agricultural products are commodities in global markets, and policies that increase demand for these products will raise prices and likely lead to expansion of new cropland. Both responses are likely to have negative impacts on climate, food security, and nature. Furthermore, many models and carbon accounting frameworks undercount biofuels’ land carbon cost or miss it entirely.

“That’s why both the land and the types of biomass used for fuels matter. The pledge says that efforts to scale up fuel use must be environmentally and socially responsible. But it does not include critical caveats from the IEA report: that biofuel expansion should not further increase cropland use, and that waste and residue-based biomass potentially offer a more sustainable pathway than feedstocks grown on dedicated land—although the amounts are limited, making scalability challenging. National policies should account for these important nuances.

“All countries should develop a strategy for how best to use their limited land to advance prosperity and meet people’s growing needs for food, while achieving climate and nature goals. These strategies should align with national pledges to halt deforestation and preserve existing ecosystems. Any mandates that intensify pressure on land risk undermining those commitments.

“More locally grounded research is needed to inform these strategies. For instance, how can Brazil best use its 40 to 100 million hectares of degraded land to meet its needs for food, wood products, jobs, revenue and energy, while protecting and restoring nature and meeting climate goals? As the demands on our land grow, while the planet’s land area stays the same, evidence-based land-use planning will be essential to balance competing priorities.”",https://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-07 21:03:00.028286

The cornerstone of the package is the new High-Speed Rail Action Plan, which sets a vision for a faster, more interoperable, and better-connected European rail network by 2040.

The plan, which builds on the existing Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), foresees connecting major nodes at speeds of 200 km/h and above. Illustrative examples of the ambitious time savings include cutting travel from Berlin to Copenhagen from seven hours to four, and from Sofia to Athens from over 13 hours to just six. New cross-border links, such as Paris–Lisbon via Madrid, are also planned to simplify long-distance journeys.

To achieve this vision, the Commission proposes four key strands of action:

• Removing cross-border bottlenecks by setting binding timelines by 2027 and identifying options for speeds well above $250 km/h where economically viable.

• Developing a coordinated financing strategy, including a ""High-Speed Rail Deal"" through a strategic dialogue with industry and financiers to mobilise the necessary investment.

• Improving the conditions for the rail industry by enhancing cross-border ticketing, supporting a second-hand market for rolling stock, and accelerating the deployment of EU digital management systems.

• Strengthening EU-level governance to improve coordination among infrastructure managers for cross-border services and facilitate standardisation.

The second major initiative is the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), which outlines a common approach to boost investment in renewable and low-carbon fuels for the aviation and waterborne sectors. To meet the binding RefuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime targets, the EU will require approximately 20 million tonnes of sustainable fuels (biofuels and e-fuels) by 2035, necessitating an estimated €100 billion in total investment.

The plan details key investment measures designed to mobilise at least €2.9 billion through EU instruments by 2027, including:

• At least €2 billion for sustainable alternative fuels under InvestEU.

• €300 million through the European Hydrogen Bank for hydrogen-based fuels.

• €446 million from the Innovation Fund for synthetic aviation and maritime fuel projects.

• €133.5 million for fuels-related research under Horizon Europe.

Furthermore, the Commission plans to launch an eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project by the end of 2025 to mobilise at least €500 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-07 21:03:04.414541

His mission is nothing short of a revolution: to make flying sustainable without grounding an industry that supports more than 810,000 Canadian jobs.

“I’ve been in aviation for over 25 years, always in the fuel environment,” Tauvette said. “What I’m doing now is really trying to change the industry.”

The fuel that changed flight—now changing again

Conventional jet fuel, Tauvette explained, “sits a little below diesel fuel” in the refining process—roughly 10 percent of a barrel of crude. But a new generation of fuels is emerging. “Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a jet fuel replacement,” he said. “It’s made from renewable materials and produces, on a lifecycle basis, way less emissions compared to a normal barrel of jet fuel.”

SAF, he says, is “the biggest solution for the industry in terms of reducing its emissions.”

The global aviation sector was one of the first to adopt decarbonization targets. Airlines have shaved weight, improved aerodynamics, and rolled out aircraft that are 10–15 percent more fuel efficient than the previous generation. But all the efficiency in the world won’t matter without a cleaner fuel source.

The cost turbulence

The catch? Price.

“Jet fuel usually represents about 25 percent of an airline’s costs,” Tauvette said. “How do we work in a fuel that today is anywhere from three to eight times more expensive than current fuel?”

At present, Sustainable Aviation Fuel makes up less than two percent of global jet fuel consumption. Yet demand is poised to soar as countries, corporations, and consumers seek low-carbon travel.

The Canadian advantage—still untapped

Tauvette argues that Canada has “all the right ingredients” to lead the SAF revolution: sustainable feedstocks, advanced refining capacity, and a market of willing airlines. “We refine hard-to-refine stuff, and this is what this is,” he said. “If we make it affordable enough, all the international airlines flying into Canada will pick it up as well.”

C-SAF outlines the immediate opportunity: fuels made from wastes like used cooking oil, as well as forest and agricultural residues that can be converted into low-carbon “biocrudes.” Down the road, carbon captured from the air or industrial processes could also be combined with renewable hydrogen to produce jet fuel with near-zero net emissions.

The problem isn’t imagination—it’s investment. “Unfortunately, we need support from the government,” Tauvette said. “Support through some form of incentive-type mechanism to help create the environment to make those investments to put the manufacturing in place.”

The runway to the future

Without clear policy, price parity, and production incentives, Canada risks being left on the tarmac while others soar ahead. As Tauvette puts it, this is the moment to act. “We have everything we need,” he said. “Now we just need the will to build it.”

However, researchers caution that scaling up biofuel production without strict safeguards could undermine climate progress, displace communities, degrade ecosystems, and worsen food insecurity.
While some nations may achieve marginal emissions reductions through advanced biofuels or waste-based pathways, the global trend in biofuels consumption remains deeply unsustainable.
92% of projected 2030 biofuel demand is still expected to be met by food-type feedstocks.
This is highly relevant for exploring sustainable fuel alternatives within international aviation and shipping decarbonization frameworks, such as CORSIA and IMO.","Scientists and civil society groups are warning COP delegations and attendees about the risks posed by a rapid expansion of global biofuel demand. While often promoted as a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels, biofuels, particularly those made from food and feed crops, may carry serious environmental and social consequences if their production grows unchecked.

Current demand from the road transport sector is set to rise further due to ambitious targets in aviation and shipping, including EU and national Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates and the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero framework.

However, researchers caution that scaling up biofuel production without strict safeguards could undermine climate progress, displace communities, degrade ecosystems, and worsen food insecurity. Projections indicate that by 2030, the global cropland required for biofuels in the transport sector, excluding crop co-products, could reach 52 million hectares, a 63% increase from 2023 levels, which is roughly the size of France.

Experts note that this represents a highly inefficient use of land and agricultural resources. By comparison, only 3% of the current biofuels area would be needed to generate the same amount of energy from solar panels, which underscores the relative inefficiency of producing energy by burning crops.

While some nations may achieve marginal emissions reductions through advanced biofuels or waste-based pathways, the global trend in biofuels consumption remains deeply unsustainable. 92% of projected 2030 biofuel demand is still expected to be met by food-type feedstocks. Meanwhile, even optimistic estimates of biofuel life-cycle savings are often dwarfed by the carbon opportunity costs of not restoring land to forests or other natural systems.

The expansion of crop biofuels is not a climate solution. It is a costly detour.

… the experts highlight.

As COP30 approaches—an opportune moment of global reckoning and responsibility, the signatories call on world leaders to:

Prevent an uninhibited expansion of first-generation biofuels under international climate mechanisms or national plans;

Phase out subsidies and mandates for biofuels from food and feed crops, and redirect support to more sustainable energy solutions;

Prioritise investments in electrification and energy efficiency and sufficiency as primary strategies for decarbonizing road transport;

Prioritise land restoration and biodiversity protection over land conversion for fuel production;

Establish robust global sustainability criteria, verification procedures, and sufficient enforcement frameworks that justifiably account for indirect emissions, carbon opportunity costs, and social impacts. This is highly relevant for exploring sustainable fuel alternatives within international aviation and shipping decarbonization frameworks, such as CORSIA and IMO.

Finally, the scientists note that truly sustainable biofuels can play a limited role in decarbonising a narrow set of hard-to-electrify sectors, such as aviation, but this must not justify a blind embrace of policies that repeat past mistakes of relentless crop biofuels expansion.

The science is clear: we cannot burn our way to net zero, especially not at the expense of forests, food, and future generations. We urge you to reflect on this science in the decisions made at COP30.

The pledge from 21 carriers will oblige them to clarify that the emissions of a specific flight cannot be “neutralised, offset, or directly reduced” by contributing to climate protection projects or alternative fuels — claims the EU says amount to greenwashing.

“To avoid misleading consumers, airlines must refrain from using vague environmental language and ensure that any claims about future environmental performance are substantiated,” the commission said in a statement.

The announcement made in the run-up to next week’s COP30 UN climate summit in Brazil stems from a consultation between airlines, the EU executive and consumer protection groups.

Airlines also pledged to present carbon emission calculations in a clear and transparent manner and provide robust scientific evidence when claiming environmental improvements.

The carriers concerned are Air Baltic, Air Dolomiti, Air France, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, EasyJet, Finnair, KLM, Lufthansa, Luxair, Norwegian, Ryanair, SAS, SWISS, TAP, Transavia France, Transavia CV, Volotea, Vueling and Wizz Air.

The commitments follow a formal complaint lodged with the European Commission in June 2023 by consumer groups, which accused the aviation sector of misleading advertising practices.

The industry has begun to shift its messaging after a series of legal setbacks.

In March 2024, a Dutch court ruled against KLM in a greenwashing case, saying the airline misled consumers with vague claims about the sustainability of its flights.

A year later, a German court barred Lufthansa from advertising carbon offsetting in a way deemed deceptive.

Air France no longer offers carbon offsets for flights. Instead, it suggests passengers contribute to the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel.

“There is room to change” in the way airlines communicate, said Diane Vitry, who heads up the aviation section of the NGO Transport & Environment.

She said the ideal would be for flight ads to mention their climate impact, similar to the health warnings included on tobacco and alcohol labels.

Aviation accounts for around 3% of global carbon emissions, but its overall contribution to climate change is higher because of the release of other greenhouse gases and condensation trails at high altitudes.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/10/klm-plane-at-amsterdam-schipol-airport.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-11-07 15:16:31.122143

Fluor Investment Narrative Recap

For investors considering Fluor, belief in the company’s ability to rebound from substantial third quarter losses and legal challenges is crucial. The recent net loss of US$697 million and the class action lawsuit alleging misleading financial statements intensify scrutiny of management’s execution and risk controls, which could limit confidence in short-term catalysts like new project awards, while legal uncertainties present the biggest current risk. Whether these issues materially delay the company’s shift towards earnings growth and cash generation depends on the speed and clarity of their resolution.

Among recent developments, Fluor’s contract to engineer LanzaJet’s sustainable aviation fuel project in the UK stands out. This project reinforces Fluor's ongoing involvement in growth-oriented, low-carbon infrastructure markets and supports the narrative that a robust backlog and new awards could aid future revenue and earnings, provided the legal and financial headwinds are managed effectively.

However, with the legal uncertainties mounting around project costs and financial disclosures, it’s equally important for investors to be aware that...

The report presents a strategic road map, highlighting the country’s preparedness to scale SAF production, enhance rural incomes, boost greener fuel alternatives, and access international export markets.

SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80 per cent, making it the most immediate and scalable decarbonisation lever for aviation, it said.

Further, the report mentioned the government-mandated blending targets of 1 per cent by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028 and 5 per cent by 2030.

The report emphasised the economic and ecological advantages, such as decreased fuel imports saving billions, job creation in green sectors, and enhanced income for rural communities.

India is well-positioned to supply SAF to premium markets like the EU, Japan, Singapore, and the Middle East, it added.

Anish De, Global Head, Energy Natural Resources & Chemicals, KPMG in India, emphasised the need for a coordinated systems approach that aligns policy, finance, technology, and offtake commitments.

“India’s SAF journey will be built on the intelligent use of our abundant feedstock base – from agricultural residues and municipal solid waste to press-mud and used cooking oil,” said Vivek Rahi, Partner and National Head – Oil & Gas, KPMG in India.

The key to success will be establishing viable supply chains and long-term offtake frameworks involving airlines, OMCs, and technology providers, he added.",https://smefutures.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/India-poised-to-become-global-leader-in-sustainable-aviation-fuel.webp,N,,2025-11-07 13:16:39.261740

This landmark agreement positions the Oregon plant to become the largest greenfield SAF project in the United States, a critical development as the aviation industry aggressively pursues decarbonization goals.

The facility, which is currently subject to a final investment decision, is expected to be operational by 2029 and will boast a substantial production capacity of up to 50,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel and SAF. This output—equivalent to roughly 750 million gallons per year—will significantly bolster the U.S.'s supply of low-carbon fuels.

Topsoe will deliver a suite of its proprietary solutions: HydroFlex™, SynCOR™, and H2bridge™ technologies, along with specialized catalysts. These integrated technologies are central to the project’s goal of producing fuels with one of the lowest carbon footprints globally.

The core innovation of the Port Westward project lies in the seamless integration of Topsoe’s technologies. The HydroFlex™ technology is a proven solution for converting a wide array of renewable feedstocks—such as fats, oils, and greases—into high-quality ""drop-in"" renewable diesel and jet fuel that is chemically identical to their petroleum-based counterparts.

Crucially, the facility will employ Topsoe's H2bridge™ solution, which is designed to recycle biogenic propane and off-gas from the HydroFlex™ process. This waste stream is converted into low-carbon hydrogen, which is then fed back into the process. This circular approach replaces the need for external, fossil-derived feedstocks for hydrogen production, leading to a substantial reduction in the overall carbon intensity of the final renewable fuels.

Christopher Efird, CEO & Chairperson of NXTClean Fuels, highlighted this competitive advantage, stating that the technologies and catalysts ""dramatically reduce the carbon intensity of our fuels, making our products among the cleanest SAF and renewable diesel supplies in the world.""

The project comes at a time of explosive growth in the sustainable fuel market. Henrik Rasmussen, Managing Director of Topsoe Americas, noted that the facility will ""significantly increase the production of SAF in the U.S."" and supports Topsoe’s role in reducing emissions within American aviation.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF production is projected to more than double in 2025 compared to 2024, reaching 2.1 million tons (2.7 billion liters).",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-07 12:20:54.573905

The European Commission has launched a bold new initiative to reshape the continent’s transport network, focusing on expanding high-speed rail and investing in sustainable aviation fuels. These measures are part of a larger effort to reduce carbon emissions, improve connectivity, and accelerate Europe’s transition to greener, more efficient travel. By introducing faster rail links and increasing the availability of alternative fuels, the Commission aims to enhance both cross-border rail services and aviation sustainability, ultimately driving Europe towards its long-term environmental and mobility goals.

The European Commission has taken significant steps to make travel across the continent more efficient and sustainable, unveiling new plans aimed at reducing carbon emissions while improving infrastructure. Announced on November 5, these initiatives, which include the High-Speed Rail Action Plan and the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), form part of a larger “comprehensive transport package.” These actions are designed to accelerate Europe’s high-speed rail network and foster the growth of renewable and low-carbon fuels for aviation.

The High-Speed Rail Action Plan is set to revolutionize rail travel across Europe, focusing on enhancing cross-border connections and reducing travel times on the Trans-European Transport Network by 2040. This ambitious plan aims to ensure that key destinations in the network can be reached at speeds of over 200 km/h, significantly cutting journey durations. For example, travel between Berlin and Copenhagen will be reduced to four hours, down from the current seven, while trips from Sofia to Athens will drop from 13 hours and 40 minutes to just six hours. Additionally, new high-speed rail links will connect Paris to Lisbon via Madrid and Warsaw to Tallinn.

One of the main goals of the High-Speed Rail Action Plan is to make ticketing and booking systems more seamless across borders. This includes eliminating bottlenecks, enhancing cross-border governance, and improving long-distance rail services within the EU. To fund this transformation, the European Commission has committed to developing a “coordinated financing strategy” in collaboration with member states, the rail industry, and financial backers. This effort will help mobilize the necessary investments for these ambitious upgrades.

Meanwhile, the STIP is designed to bolster Europe’s commitment to cleaner fuels. The plan focuses on increasing investment in the development of alternative aviation fuels and boosting domestic production to meet ambitious targets set under the RefuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime programs. This initiative outlines a series of measures to raise a minimum of €2.9 billion by 2027. Among the key funding allocations, €2 billion will be directed towards alternative fuels through the EU’s ‘InvestEU’ program. Additionally, the European Hydrogen Bank will contribute €300 million to support hydrogen-based fuels for aviation and shipping. There is also a provision of €446 million from the EU’s Innovation Fund for synthetic aviation and maritime fuel projects, as well as €133.5 million to fund research and innovation in fuel technologies.

An exciting development tied to the STIP is the creation of the ‘eSAF Early Movers Coalition,’ which aims to raise €500 million by the end of 2025. This pilot project will help support synthetic aviation fuel production, furthering Europe’s push to decarbonize its aviation sector.

The response from industry groups has been largely positive, with the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) expressing support for the initiatives. During a meeting in Brussels, the GBTA’s European advisory board chairperson met with EU policymakers and welcomed the adoption of the STIP. However, the association also emphasized the importance of fast-tracking the “CountEmissionsEU” initiative, which aims to provide accurate, transparent, and comparable emissions data across all modes of transport. The GBTA believes this will play a crucial role in helping the industry measure its progress toward sustainability goals.

While the aviation sector also welcomed the STIP’s announcement, there were concerns raised about the funding allocations. Industry groups such as Airlines for Europe, ACI Europe, the European Regions Airline Association (ERA), and the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO) pointed out that the proposed funding seemed insufficient given the scale of investment required to accelerate the decarbonization of the aviation industry. According to these organizations, reaching the EU’s net-zero aviation target will require an investment of approximately €100 billion by 2035.

In addition, the aviation groups called for more clarity on the implementation of a ‘Book & Claim’ system, which would ensure that alternative aviation fuels are accessible at all EU airports. This mechanism would provide the flexibility needed to ensure that sustainable aviation fuel is available to airlines regardless of their operating base.

The European Commission’s ambitious initiatives mark a significant step toward transforming Europe’s transport landscape, focusing not only on expanding rail connectivity but also on ensuring a cleaner, greener future for aviation. However, the road ahead may require further investment and collaboration between policymakers and industry players to meet the continent’s long-term sustainability goals. The success of these plans will largely depend on how effectively they are implemented and whether the proposed funding levels are sufficient to drive the necessary changes across both sectors.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/freepik__create-an-ultrarealisti-10-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 11:56:24.231851

In 2024, following the BEUC complaint, the EU Commission and the Network of Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Authorities said that they had identified several types of potentially misleading practices by the airlines, including creating the incorrect impression that additional fees to finance climate projects or the use of alternative fuels can reduce or fully counterbalance CO2 emissions, using the term “sustainable aviation fuel” without clearly justifying the fuels’ environmental impact, using terms such as “green”, “sustainable” or “responsible” in an absolute way, and claiming that the airline is moving toward environmental performance such as net zero emissions without clear and verifiable commitments, targets and an independent monitoring system.

Additional practices identified included presenting a “calculator” of a flight’s emissions without providing scientific proof on the reliability of the calculation, and presenting consumers with a comparison of the CO2 emissions of flights without providing sufficient information on the elements behind the comparisons.

The Commission and CPC network launched a dialogue with the airlines, asking them to outline proposals to bring their practices in line with EU consumer law, and warned that they may face enforcement actions by the CPC authorities if they fail to take steps to solve the concerns, including sanctions.

Under the new agreement, each of the airlines have committed to stop claiming that the CO2 emissions of a specific flight could be neutralized, offset, or directly reduced by consumer financial contributions to climate protection projects or alternative aviation fuels.

Additional commitments discussed with the airlines included using the term “sustainable aviation fuels” only if substantiated with appropriate clarifications, refraining from the use of vague green language or terminology, providing more information on claims about future environmental performance – such as achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions – with clear timelines, achievable steps, and the types of emissions concerned, ensuring that CO2 emissions calculations are displayed in a clear and transparent way, and providing sufficient scientific evidence and information to support claims of improved environmental impact.

The Commission said that the national consumer protection authorities will monitor the airlines’ implementation of the commitments along the timeline communicated by each airline, adding that they may may also proceed with enforcement measures against airlines that have not provided sufficient commitments or fail to correctly implement the commitments.

Aviation remains one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise, and the UK’s pathway to net zero will depend on scaling up Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production. The SAF mandate and the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) are the key policy instruments which form the backbone of this effort. These instruments have been areas of policy consistency across the previous Conservative and current Labour governments.

The SAF mandate

The SAF mandate is a policy mechanism designed to secure demand for SAF by:

Obliging fuel suppliers in the UK to supply an increasing proportion of SAF in the overall UK aviation fuel mix

Incentivising SAF supply through the award of tradeable certificates with a cash value – the number of certificates will be issued in proportion to the level of GHG emission reductions achieved by the fuel delivered.

To qualify under the SAF mandate, fuels must achieve a minimum of 40% reduction in GHG emissions, measured on a lifecycle basis.

The SAF mandate consists of two obligations: the main obligation and the power-to-liquid obligation. The main obligation begins at 2% of the total fossil jet fuel supplied in 2025 and will increase annually to 10% in 2030, and then to 22% in 2040. The power-to-liquid obligation takes effect in 2028 at 0.2% of total jet fuel demand and will increase to 3.5% of total jet fuel demand in 2040. Both obligations include a buy-out mechanism that facilitates compliance when suppliers are unable to secure a supply of SAF.

To provide policy support for SAF technologies that do not rely on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) and to mitigate the risk that the aviation sector crowds out other sources of demand for first-generation biofuels, the SAF Mandate caps the contribution of HEFA to the main obligation at 100% of SAF demand in 2025-26, tapering to 71% in 2030 and 35% in 2040.

The UK government has indicated that the 2040 SAF targets will remain at the same level beyond 2040, but will be kept under review and updated to reflect how the market evolves. Early reports for 2025 suggest that the uptake of SAF has fallen below targets, and airlines are voicing concerns about limited supply, potential buy-out liabilities, and competitive disadvantages compared to carriers whose route networks leave them less exposed to the UK and EU SAF mandates.

The UK government estimates that the SAF mandate could deliver up to 6.3 megatonnes of carbon savings annually by 2040.

The Revenue Certainty Mechanism

While the SAF mandate is expected to secure demand for SAF, it does not guarantee SAF producers a fixed price for their product – a key requirement both for scaling up production beyond the inherent limits determined by the availability of qualifying HEFA and for bridging the cost gap between production and sale. The RCM is intended to address these issues for producers of 2nd and 3rd generation SAF (which exclude HEFA).

The RCM is expected to be based on the contract for differences scheme familiar to the financing markets from its use in low-carbon electricity generation. It would guarantee SAF producers a fixed price over a defined period, funded by the fuel suppliers who are subject to the SAF mandate. The legislation for the RCM is progressing through Parliament. However, much of the important detail remains unresolved (notably, how the reference price will be calculated in the absence of a liquid SAF market).

The RCM will be key to the investability of 2nd and 3rd generation SAF projects, but experience from the UK’s clean hydrogen and CCS markets shows that a revenue mechanism alone does not ensure rapid deployment. Developers in those sectors have reported frustration over the slow rollout of funding, uncertainty regarding project timelines, permitting delays, and infrastructure gaps (to name a few).

The SAF market in the UK is at a critical early growth phase, full of potential but facing structural and logistical challenges. By applying insights from early clean hydrogen and CCS projects, we think the UK government can establish a clear flightpath for sustainable aviation.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/iStock-1354153431.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 11:56:47.488992

By the Federal Aviation Administration’s unprecedented order to scale back flights nationwide because of the record-long government shutdown took effect Friday morning, with some passengers trying to figure out backup travel plans.

Airlines scrambled to adjust their schedules and began canceling flights Thursday in anticipation of the FAA’s official order, while travelers with plans for the weekend and beyond waited nervously to learn if their flights would take off as scheduled.

Airlines also planned cancellations into the weekend, directing passengers to check apps to learn their flight status.The 40 airports selected by the FAA span more than two dozen states. The FAA said the reductions would start at 4% and ramp up to 10% by Nov. 14. They are to be in effect between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. and impact all commercial airlines.

The agency said the cutbacks are necessary to relieve pressure on air traffic controllers who’ve been working without pay for more than a month. Many are pulling six-day work weeks with mandatory overtime, and increasing numbers of them have begun calling out as the financial strain and exhaustion mount.

Airlines said they would try to minimize impact on customers. Some planned to focus on slashing routes to and from small and medium-size cities. Carriers are required to refund customers whose flights are cancelled but not to cover secondary costs such as food and hotel accommodations unless a delay or cancellation results from a contributing factor that is within the control of the airlines, according to the Department of Transportation.

Industry analyst Henry Harteveldt warned that the reductions will “have a noticeable impact across the U.S. air transportation system.” More than 815 flights have been called off nationwide, according to FlightAwareDelta Air Lines said it would scratch roughly 170 flights Friday, and American Airlines planned to cut 220 a day through Monday.

With the country expected to move from the world’s fifth-largest aviation market to the third by 2030, the study outlines a clear pathway for India to take a central role in global SAF supply.

The report highlights India’s substantial availability of feedstock, including more than 680 million metric tonnes of agricultural residue, 3.4 million metric tonnes of used cooking oil, and over 1,800 crore litres of ethanol production capacity. This combination, it said, places India in an advantageous position to scale up SAF production while supporting rural economies and reducing dependence on imported fuel.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel can lower lifecycle emissions by as much as 80 percent, making it one of the most impactful near-term tools available to decarbonise aviation. The report points to the government’s phased blending targets 1 percent by 2027, 2 percent by 2028 and 5 percent by 2030 as key drivers that will accelerate industry-wide adoption.

Beyond its environmental benefits, the report emphasises the economic upside. Increased SAF production could save billions in fuel imports, generate large-scale green jobs, and raise earnings for farming communities through the sale of waste and agricultural by-products. India is also well placed to export SAF to high-value markets such as the European Union, Japan, Singapore, and the Middle East.

The study stresses the need for coordinated action across government agencies, investors, technology providers, oil marketing companies, and airlines. Experts involved in the report noted that India’s progress will depend on building efficient supply chains, ensuring long-term purchase agreements, and aligning policy incentives with industry needs. They said India’s wide range of biomass and waste-derived feedstock provides a strong foundation for scaling production, provided the right frameworks are put in place.

Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu, Minister of Civil Aviation, Govt of India said that the global aviation industry stands at crossroads between rapid growth along with the climate concerns. The sector continues to expand faster than the overall economy and most other transport segments, driven by globalization and growing passenger demand. With an annual growth rate of 6.7%, nearly 10 million passenger trips are expected in 2025. “Aviation has truly become the growth engine for mobility and businesses worldwide,” he added.

Addressing the ‘India Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit’, organized by FICCI, jointly with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the minister said that the growing energy needs of the aviation sector demand greater clarity, commitment and collaboration from all stakeholders. “Our ATF consumption is projected to reach 15-16 million ton by 2030 and 30-31 million ton by 2040. The solution here for all of us is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). With the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuels, SAF offers a direct way for all of us to reduce carbon footprint in aviation sector,” he stated.

Speaking on the potential of SAF, the Minister further stated that the government is in the process of drafting a ‘Sustainable Aviation Fuel Policy’. “The Ministry has been taking robust steps to speed-up the SAF movement and we are committed to soon releasing the SAF policy,” he emphasized.

Mr Kinjarapu also stated that as agricultural powerhouse with over 750 million ton of biomass, India has the capacity to become the global leader in SAF production. SAF will not only help in addressing the challenge of growth versus sustainability but will also benefit with its huge scale impact by reducing crude oil import bill by $ 5-7 billion every year along with creating 1 million green jobs across SAF value chain.

The Minister said that in the last 9 years, India has added 90 airports, addition of 400 aircrafts in the fleet along with increasing the scheduled flight movements by 78 per cent. “We plan to expand our airport network by 50 in the next 5 years and 200 in next 20-25 years along with a growth projection of 500 million annual passengers with growth rate of 10-12 per cent in coming 10 years,” he noted. With this growth, India’s aviation share in transport emissions is projected to rise from 5 per cent to 8-10 per cent by 2030, added Kinjarapu.

Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, DG, DGCA said that decarbonization of the aviation sector is a global endeavor. It requires shared responsibility, mutual respect and a spirit of solidarity and India is committed to being a constructive, proactive and principal partner in this journey. “Our ambition is to achieve 5 per cent SAF blending target 2030 which is not just a goal but a declaration of intent to lead by example,” he added.

Jurgen Westermeier, Chairman, FICCI National Civil Aviation Committee and President & MD, Airbus India & South Asia said SAF is also a transformative opportunity for India. “For India, the relevance of SAF extends far beyond just environmental targets- it can be a powerful economic enabler. By developing a domestic SAF industry, India can immediately and effectively enhance its energy security and sovereignty over its fuel supply chain,” he added.

Ashish Saraf, Co-Chairman, FICCI Civil Aviation Committee & Vice President and Country Head India, Pratt & Whitney said that India’s aviation journey is unstoppable. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is the cornerstone of India’s Net Zero aviation story. SAF alone could be responsible for reducing emissions by up to two-thirds, making it uniquely positioned not only to help India cut down emissions but also to take a leading role globally and become an export hub, he added.

During the event, FICCI-KPMG Thought Leadership Report was released.

Air India Crash: Supreme Court on Friday said the preliminary report on Air India fatal crash that killed hundreds does not blame the pilot. The top court said it will hear the plea by pilot's father, who is asking for an independent probe, on November 10.

The Supreme Court on Friday said no one blamed the chief pilot of the Air India Dreamliner for the June 12 crash, which claimed 260 lives, and asked his 91-year-old father not to carry any emotional burden.

""There is no insinuation against him even in the preliminary report,"" a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi said, emphasising that if necessary, the court will clarify that the pilot is not to be blamed for the ""unfortunate"" plane crash.

The top court issued notice to the Centre and the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on a plea of Pushkaraj Sabharwal, the father of deceased pilot Captain Sumeet Sabharwal.

Pushkaraj Sabharwal and the Federation of Indian Pilots have moved the Supreme Court for a court-monitored inquiry headed by a former apex court judge into the crash of Air India flight AI171 in Ahmedabad.

""First of all, it was an unfortunate plane crash and secondly, you should not carry a burden on yourself that your son is being blamed. The pilot is not to be blamed for the plane crash. It was an accident,"" the bench told senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Pushkaraj Sabharwal.

Live Events

""No one in the county believes that it was the fault of the pilot,"" it said.

Sankaranarayanan said it all started after US publication Wall Street Journal put out a news report pointing to errors on the part of the pilot that led to the plane crash and citing unnamed government sources.

The bench said, ""It was a nasty reporting only to blame India. We are not bothered by foreign media reports. No one in the country believes that it was the fault of the pilot.""

Sankaranarayanan said, ""I am aggrieved because my son was attacked.""

Justice Bagchi said if the petitioner is aggrieved by the foreign media reports, then, with respect, his remedy lies in American court, where he can file a suit.

""Your angst is understandable but there is clear incongruity between public perception and the factual position,"" Justice Bagchi added.

The judges read out a paragraph from the preliminary report of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) issued on July 12 and said nowhere does it state that the pilot is to be blamed and it only refers to the conversation between him and his co-pilot.

""There is just a mention of the cockpit recorder where one pilot asked whether the fuel was cut off by the other and the other pilot said no. There's no suggestion of any fault in that report. There is no question of apportioning blame on them,"" Justice Bagchi said.

Sankaranarayanan pointed out that there were persistent safety issues involving Boeing aircraft globally and the Ahmedabad crash must be viewed in that larger context.

""The scope of the AAIB investigation is not to blame but to suggest preventive measures. If necessary, we will clarify that the pilot cannot be blamed,"" the bench said.

""We are a country of around 142 crore people and none of them believes the blame has to go to the pilot. Whatever could be the reason for the tragedy, it is not the pilots,"" it added.

Sankaranarayanan said that they want an independent probe into the matter and the preliminary report prepared after the tragedy was not based on an independent investigation.

Justice Bagchi said the investigation into the accident was conducted according to the process.

""If you challenge the investigation, you have to challenge the statutory provisions of the (Aircraft) Act itself,"" the judge said.

Sankaranarayanan said, ""These pilots are offering their services to the nation. Such kind of insinuations... that's very sad.""

The bench listed the matter for further hearing on November 10, along with other pending petitions on the crash.

Pushkaraj Sabharwal has sought a ""fair, transparent and technically robust"" investigation into the tragic incident.

He said his son had an ""unblemished career spanning over 30 years, with 15,638 hours of incident-free flying, including 8,596 hours on Boeing 787-8 aircraft, without a single reported lapse or incident causing fatalities or otherwise"".

The petition, filed through AP&J Chambers on October 10, made Union Ministry of Civil Aviation, DGCA and AAIB respondents.

The plea seeks directions for the constitution of an independent committee, also comprising aviation and technical experts, to probe the crash.

The approach of the investigation has resulted in a failure to adequately examine, or rule out, other more plausible technical and procedural factors relating to Boeing that could have contributed to the tragic incident, the plea said.

""An incomplete and prejudiced inquiry, without identification of the exact cause of the accident, endangers the lives of future passengers and undermines aviation safety at large, causing a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution,"" it said.

The probe team is dominated by officers from DGCA and the state aviation authorities whose procedures, oversight and possible lapses are directly implicated in the investigation, it added.

The ill-fated aircraft took off from Ahmedabad for London Gatwick but crashed within minutes, impacting the BJ Medical College hostel located less than a nautical mile from the end of the runway.

The Emergency Locator Transmitter failed to activate, and both the pilot-in-command Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Captain Clive Kunder lost their lives in the crash, the plea said.

Union Minister for Civil Aviation recently said that India will soon release a national policy on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), aligns with India targets Net Zero by 2070.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – Refers to aviation fuel derived from non-fossil sources, such as agricultural residue, municipal solid waste, used cooking oil, etc.

It offers a life-cycle carbon emission reduction of up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Global Targets – 5% CO₂ emissions reduction by 2030 and reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

India’s target – Blending targets of 1% by 2027, 2% by 2028 and 5% by 2030 for international flights under International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)’s Carbon Offsetting & Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) programme.

India’s Biomass Capacity – 750 million tonnes of total biomass availability, in that 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue.

SAF requirement – 1% blending by 2027 - 30 million litres, 2% target for 2028 - 62 million litres.

Current domestic production capacity – Domestic oil manufacturing companies collectively have 70 million litres/year production capacity.

Public-Private Collaboration – Airbus–Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya (GSV) signed a Joint Study Agreement (JSA), focused on converting municipal solid waste into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Quick Fact

Carbon Offsetting & Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)

It is a global market-based me asure (MBM) to stabilize net CO₂ emissions from international civil aviation.

Launched by – International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016.

Aim – To cap net CO₂ emissions from international aviation at 2020 levels and achieve net-zero by 2050.

The European Commission has unveiled the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, a strategic roadmap designed to mobilise at least 2.9 billion euro by 2027 for renewable and low carbon fuels in aviation and maritime transport. The package signals unwavering policy stability, a factor research shows is more valuable to investors than generous subsidies. By confirming long term fuel blending mandates up to 2050, the Commission turns regulatory pressure into a clear commercial opportunity.

How the money will flow

· InvestEU will underwrite two billion euros in loan guarantees, lowering borrowing costs for first-of-a-kind refineries.

· The European Hydrogen Bank is reserving three hundred million euro to reward producers that transform green hydrogen into aviation fuel.

· The Innovation Fund and Horizon Europe add nearly six hundred million euro for large demonstration plants and science based breakthroughs.

A useful detail is that every programme now shares a single application template, saving developers months of duplicated paperwork.

Making projects bankable

Beyond grants, the Plan introduces a double sided auction platform that matches fuel makers and airlines or ship operators under fifteen year contracts. The mechanism converts volatile feedstock prices into predictable cash flow, improving debt service coverage ratios that lenders scrutinise. This financial engineering, borrowed from offshore wind auctions, could cut the weighted cost of capital by up to two percentage points.

A non-obvious advantage

Synthetic fuel facilities will be located close to existing pipeline corridors so that captured carbon dioxide can be reused and transported cheaply. This co siting approach quietly converts a potential waste stream into a revenue stream and shortens permitting timelines.

Conclusion

With a blended approach of grants, guarantees, and market design, Europe is turning climate ambition into investable reality. The Plan fast tracks technology deployment, strengthens energy autonomy, and keeps European innovators at the forefront of global green transport.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-7.svg,N,,2025-11-07 10:56:35.856335

New SAF, ethanol, and waste-to-fuel plants need major investment

Ethiopia’s Ministry of Water and Energy (MoWE) has set mandatory biofuel blending targets for road fuels, ethanol-gasoline and biodiesel-diesel, and for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2035.

The measure, reported by the press on Nov. 3, 2025, stems from a revised national biofuels strategy developed in June 2025 with support from the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB). The strategy seeks to cut the country’s reliance on imported hydrocarbons, develop a local production industry, and set separate targets for ethanol, biodiesel, and SAF.

Implementing the plan will require raising hundreds of millions of dollars to build local industrial capacity. According to the World Bank’s June 2025 report Fueling Africa’s Flight, the strategy requires new industrial plants capable of converting molasses and other agricultural residues into liquid fuels.

For aviation, an Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) plant with a capacity of 2,000 barrels per day would require about $376 million in investment and could meet around 6% of national kerosene demand. The report also highlights the potential to convert municipal solid waste into liquid fuels using the Fischer-Tropsch process (MSW-FT), which would cost roughly $547 million for a comparable capacity.

At the same time, the ministry plans to rehabilitate ethanol distilleries linked to public sugar factories and build new ones to boost domestic ethanol production, allowing blends of 10% to 20% in road fuel.

These investments aim to ease a major financial burden: Ethiopia’s fuel import bill rose by 14.6% to $4 billion in the 2022/2023 fiscal year, accounting for 23.1% of total merchandise imports, according to the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE). This foreign currency spending puts pressure on the balance of payments.

Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, Director General of Civil Aviation, noted that decarbonising aviation is a shared global responsibility.
Ashish Saraf, Co-Chairman, FICCI Civil Aviation Committee and Vice President & Country Head India, Pratt & Whitney, added, “Sustainable Aviation Fuel is the cornerstone of India’s Net Zero aviation story.","India will soon announce its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Policy to drive the transition towards greener air travel, said Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu, Minister of Civil Aviation, Government of India. Speaking at the India Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit organised by FICCI in partnership with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Minister underlined the urgent need for clarity, collaboration, and commitment among all stakeholders to meet the aviation sector’s growing energy demand.

“The aviation sector continues to expand faster than most other transport segments, with an annual growth rate of 6.7 per cent and nearly 10 million passenger trips expected in 2025,” said Kinjarapu. “Our ATF consumption is projected to reach 15–16 million tonnes by 2030 and 30–31 million tonnes by 2040. The solution lies in Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuels.”

He confirmed that the Ministry is finalising the SAF Policy to accelerate adoption. “The Ministry has been taking robust steps to speed up the SAF movement, and we are committed to releasing the SAF policy soon,” he stated.

Highlighting India’s potential, Kinjarapu said that as an agricultural powerhouse generating over 750 million tonnes of biomass, the country can become a global leader in SAF production. This transition, he said, could reduce India’s crude oil import bill by USD 5–7 billion annually and generate around one million green jobs across the SAF value chain.

Over the past nine years, India has added 90 airports and 400 aircraft, while scheduled flight movements have risen by 78 per cent . The government plans to add 50 airports in the next five years and 200 more over the next two decades, with passenger traffic projected to reach 500 million annually.

Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, Director General of Civil Aviation, noted that decarbonising aviation is a shared global responsibility. “Our ambition to achieve a 5 per cent SAF blending target by 2030 is not just a goal but a declaration of intent to lead by example,” he said.

Adding an industry perspective, Jurgen Westermeier, Chairman, FICCI National Civil Aviation Committee and President & MD, Airbus India & South Asia, called SAF a transformative opportunity. “For India, SAF goes beyond environmental targets—it can enhance energy security and sovereignty,” he said.

Ashish Saraf, Co-Chairman, FICCI Civil Aviation Committee and Vice President & Country Head India, Pratt & Whitney, added, “Sustainable Aviation Fuel is the cornerstone of India’s Net Zero aviation story. It can reduce emissions by up to two-thirds, positioning India as a global SAF hub.”

Neste's investment in the Singapore refinery marked a pivotal milestone as the company’s first major renewable products focused investment in Asia and outside of Finland. In 2010, Neste’s refinery in Singapore commenced operations as the world's largest renewable diesel refinery.

A subsequent expansion in 2023 integrated sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production capabilities into the refinery operations, elevating the total production capacity of renewable products to 2.6 million tons annually, encompassing renewable diesel, SAF, and renewable raw materials for polymers and chemicals.

“The Singapore refinery's 15th anniversary is a testament to Neste’s refining expertise and the dedication of our talented employees in Singapore. Their commitment to pioneering renewable solutions and our strategic growth in the region make this refinery a cornerstone of our global operations, giving us an advantage in global competition and enabling us to continue helping our customers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions,” said Jukka Kanerva, senior vice-president, refining, renewable products at Neste.

Neste’s Porvoo oil refinery in Finland began operations in 1965 with the purpose to secure Finland’s oil supply. After its expansion, it became the largest oil refinery in the Nordics already in the 1970s.

The basis for Neste’s fuel innovations was built at the Porvoo refinery. Lead-free and sulphur-free fuels were Neste’s first steps towards improving products' environmental performance, and in the 1990s, Neste’s NEXBTL technology for renewables production was developed and NEXBTL refining units started-up in 2007 and 2009 at the Porvoo refinery.

“The Porvoo refinery is one of the most complex refineries in Europe. It was built that way to ensure flexibility in producing more than 100 products from a variety of raw materials, including different crude oil qualities.

SAF refers to renewable or waste-derived aviation fuel that meets sustainability criteria.

The minister urged private players to participate in SAF production alongside oil companies. Globally, the demand for SAF is projected at 183 million tonnes by 2040.

The minister stressed that all industry players will have a say before the policy is officially finalized.

India aims to achieve 1% SAF blending in jet fuel by 2027, 2% by 2028, and 5% by 2030. The fuel can be used as a drop-in substitute in Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which powers aircraft.

India’s aviation market, currently the fifth-largest globally, is projected to become the third-largest by 2030, positioning the country as a potential global leader in SAF production. Domestic carriers have already placed orders for over 1,700 aircraft, reflecting rapid market growth.

Highlighting India’s potential, Naidu noted that the country has over 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue.

He added that SAF production could increase farmers’ incomes by 10–15 %, reduce crude oil import bills by $5–7 billion annually, and generate over 1 million green jobs across the SAF value chain.

A report by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) and KPMG released on Thursday stated that India has the raw materials to scale SAF production, including over 680 million tonnes of agricultural residue, 3.4 million tonnes of used cooking oil, and ethanol capacity exceeding 1,800 crore litres.

SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80 per cent, making it the most immediate and scalable lever for decarbonizing aviation.

To further promote sustainability, Airbus India chief Jurgen Westermeier suggested integrating corporate spending on airlines’ voluntary SAF programs under the government’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) framework.

Under the Companies Act, certain profitable entities must allocate at least 2% of their annual profit to CSR activities.

Fluor Corporation has been awarded the contract to conduct the front-end engineering and design of a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industrial project in northern England. The initiative, named Project Speedbird, is led by LanzaJet in partnership with British Airways. The contract value has not been disclosed and will be recognised in the third quarter.

A technology based on second-generation ethanol

The facility will be located in Teesside, selected for its industrial infrastructure and access to a skilled workforce. The project will deploy LanzaJet’s proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet technology, converting ethanol from agricultural residues and woody biomass into SAF. Annual output will exceed 90,000 tonnes, including SAF and renewable diesel.

British Airways plans to use the fuel to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by around 230,000 tonnes per year, equivalent to the emissions from 26,000 domestic flights. The site development marks a step forward in the industrial scale-up of SAF solutions in the United Kingdom.

A strategic partnership for commercial-scale deployment

Fluor Corporation will serve as engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) provider. The group will contribute its expertise in the design and delivery of complex industrial projects. LanzaJet views the collaboration as a demonstration of its commitment to scaling renewable fuels technologies.

Project Speedbird joins a growing portfolio of commercial-scale developments led by LanzaJet in the alternative fuels sector. The company is currently developing several similar facilities to meet the growing demand for low-carbon aviation fuel.

SAF certificates are a way for companies to support sustainable aviation fuel even if they don’t physically use the fuel itself.","Aviation connects people and goods across the globe, driving more than US $4.1 trillion in annual turnover – around 3.9% of global GDP. Yet these personal and economic benefits come with a cost. Aviation accounts for over 2% of global emissions and as demand for aviation grows, it’s more important than ever to look for solutions.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) – a biofuel made from renewable feedstocks like agricultural waste fats, oils, greases and certain cover crops – offers the fastest path to decabonising flight, with the potential to cut lifecycle emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle.

To scale this solution, innovation must extend beyond the fuel itself. New market tools and financial mechanisms are helping bridge the gap between limited supply and growing demand. SAF certificates and Book and Claim systems are redefining how companies can invest in cleaner flight – unlocking capital, building market confidence and accelerating aviation’s journey to net zero.

The solution and challenge of sustainable aviation fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel is a drop-in fuel solution, meaning it can be used in existing aircraft engines and infrastructure without any modifications, and it has already safely powered over 900,000 flights, according to the Aviation Transport Action Group.

However, costs of feedstocks and new infrastructure to produce sustainable aviation fuel makes it currently two to three times more expensive to produce than fossil jet fuel. And, since airlines operate on thin margins, it’s difficult for them to pay for a premium product like SAF. These challenges have slowed the capital investments necessary to achieve economies of scale and bring down prices. In 2024, sustainable aviation fuel accounted for only about 0.3% of all aviation fuel and was available at only a fraction of the world’s airports.

But airlines aren’t the only players that matter here. Some of the biggest sustainable aviation fuel customers in recent years have been corporations looking to address the emissions from flying their people and goods around the world. Their involvement has led to game changing decarbonisation mechanisms in use today.

New market tools and financial mechanisms to grow SAF demand

Two tools in particular have become vital to expanding sustainable aviation fuel demand and scaling the industry: SAF certificates (SAFc) and Book and Claim. SAF certificates are a way for companies to support sustainable aviation fuel even if they don’t physically use the fuel itself. For example, while SAF might not yet be readily available at all airports, SAF certificates allow companies to nonetheless purchase and claim the emissions reduction value of SAF against its own aviation emissions, while the actual fuel might be used elsewhere. SAFc are also known as ‘insets’ because the emissions and mitigation occur within the same sector. This model helps to scale the demand and investment in sustainable aviation fuel, even before wide physical distribution is readily available.

Book and Claim makes it possible to track both the physical fuel and its environmental attributes, just like a bank digitally tracks currency transactions. The fuel and the environmental attributes are tracked on a transparent SAFc registry from the time they are created until they are claimed, or retired, by the purchaser. With this model, multiple customers can share the cost premium, further expanding the market and lowering the price for everyone.

These tools were originally conceived and developed by the World Economic Forum and Rocky Mountain Institute, two organisations focused on market-based ways to mitigate climate change. The theory holds that corporations with strong balance sheets and the ability to commit to longer-term contracts will demonstrate durable demand, which in turn gives investors the confidence to finance new projects, ultimately growing supply.

Leading the commercialisation and partnering on SAF contracts

Verified emission reduction tools like SAFc bring the right customers, who want to cut emissions, to the table. World Energy recognises the potential of these measures and took steps to commercialise these tools in 2023 by partnering with first movers such as Microsoft, DHL and Boston Consulting Group on long-term SAFc contracts. These collaborations focused on ensuring the integrity of the SAF emissions reductions with a trustworthy ecosystem of standard setters, auditors and digital registries.

To date, World Energy SAFc contracts alone, including those which run years into the future, add up to about 2.9 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) reduced. That’s equal to flying more than 9.7 million economy class passengers from Heathrow, London, to JFK, New York, without CO2 emissions.

Others have followed suit. The Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) achieved a milestone in 2024 by aggregating decarbonisation demand from nearly 20 companies to abate about 500,000 MTCO2e, bringing a historic total of US $200 million into the current SAF industry. Much more work is needed, but the growth of SAFc registries reflects the increasing recognition that these tools can accelerate decarbonising the aviation industry.

Opportunity for action across industries

The system to use insets and Book and Claim to power corporate investment in high value climate solutions is most mature in the aviation sector, but it’s taking root in other hard-to-abate sectors like cement, steel, maritime shipping and rail cargo. We like to say that this approach will eventually decarbonise everything from cars to coffee cups.

There are still gaps to fill. Reliable public policies, uniform standards for sustainability and formal acceptance of these tools by carbon accounting leaders are essential to ensuring robust, effective action. But when it comes to the trillions of investment dollars needed to scale new infrastructure, bringing corporate customers for Scope 3 decarbonisation into the market is one of the surest ways to demonstrate bankable demand for large investors. First movers have shown how to put the SAF approach to use. The door is wide open for the next wave of companies to do the same.

2025 is a critical year for the Paris Agreement. Ten years on, we need to rethink how we frame the challenge. And seeing challenges differently is what business and we are all about.

The report, Sustainable Skies – Positioning India as a Global SAF Hub, outlines a framework for enabling India’s aviation sector to decarbonise and lead global SAF production.

According to the report, SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with conventional jet fuel. However, the cost of SAF remains two to five times higher than standard aviation turbine fuel (ATF).

Global context: aviation’s rising emissions challenge

Aviation accounts for about 2.5 per cent of global CO₂ emissions, and without decarbonisation, this share could rise to 20 per cent by 2050. As of 2023, international aviation contributed 58 per cent of total CO₂ emissions from the sector.

Globally, around 120,000 flights operate each day, including commercial, cargo, and private aircraft. In 2024, global air travel reached 9.5 billion passengers, surpassing pre-pandemic levels.

Commercial aviation consumes over 70 per cent of total ATF worldwide, with flights longer than 2,600 km accounting for 50 per cent of emissions, despite representing less than 15 per cent of total flights.

“Sustainable Aviation Fuel has emerged as one of the most viable levers to decouple aviation growth from carbon intensity,” the FICCI-KPMG report stated. “It enables up to 80 per cent lifecycle emission reduction while integrating seamlessly into today’s aircraft, fuel infrastructure, and supply chains.”

India’s aviation landscape: growth and opportunity

India recorded approximately 239 million air passengers in FY2025, making it the fifth-largest aviation market globally by passenger volume.

As of 2025, the country has 163 operational airports, with plans to expand to over 350 airports by 2047, including 50 new airports in the next five years.

Advt

Domestic passenger traffic is projected to reach 172–176 million by the end of FY2025–26, growing 4–6 per cent year-on-year.

The report notes that India’s growing air traffic will increase its dependence on aviation fuel, but also offers the scale and feedstock diversity needed to develop a self-sustaining SAF industry.

Global SAF production and trends

Global SAF production stood at 600 million litres in 2023, increased to 1.3 billion litres in 2024, and is projected to double again to 2.7 billion litres in 2025.

Currently, HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) technology accounts for 95 per cent of global SAF production, making it the dominant production pathway. Despite the growth, SAF represented just 0.3 per cent of total global jet fuel consumption in 2024.

The report cites policy and investment momentum across major economies:

1. The ICAO’s Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) targets net-zero aviation by 2050.

2. The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate and the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provide incentives for SAF production.

India’s potential as a global SAF hub

The report identifies five foundational pillars for India’s transition into a major SAF-producing nation:

1. Policy architecture – phased mandates, fiscal incentives, financial de-risking, and feedstock mobilisation.

2. Infrastructure readiness – refinery co-location, airport retrofits, cluster-based SAF ecosystems, and digitally integrated logistics corridors.

3. Carbon market alignment – monetisation through SAF-linked credits, robust monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV), and compliance frameworks.

4. Technology advancement – repurposing ethanol assets for Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) conversion, scaling HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technologies, and forming global certification partnerships.

5. Export potential – positioning India as a trusted SAF hub with certified clusters and access to premium markets.

“Realising India’s potential as a global hub for SAF will require a holistic systems-level approach — one that integrates strategic policy design, innovative business models, and coordinated industry action,” the report noted.

Economic implications and strategic benefits

A 10 per cent SAF blend in India could offset billions of dollars in annual aviation fuel imports and generate tens of thousands of rural and industrial jobs.

The report highlights that India’s established refining capacity, large bioenergy base, and energy transition policies make it well-placed to scale domestic SAF production.

It adds that developing a local SAF industry could also reduce crude import dependence, enhance rural incomes, and create green industrial value chains.

“Beyond emissions reduction, SAF symbolises the convergence of industrial policy, energy security, and climate leadership,” the report stated. “It bridges India’s aviation ambitions with its net-zero commitments.”

Outlook and challenges

While India holds potential to lead in SAF production, meeting the CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) targets will require coordinated action.

India must produce 53 million litres of SAF for a 1 per cent blend by 2027 and 290 million litres for a 5 per cent blend by 2030 for international flights alone.

The high production cost, limited supply chains, and feedstock aggregation remain near-term challenges, but the report notes that the economic and strategic case for SAF remains strong.

Woranate Laprabang, chief executive of Vietjet Thailand, said the Bangkok-Phu Quoc route started using the SAF blend yesterday, with usage expected to expand to other routes next year, such as from Bangkok to Cam Ranh and Danang.

He said SAF could reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared with the commonly used A-1 jet fuel.

Following the International Civil Aviation Organization's standard, the airline aims to use SAF blending of 5% across all routes by 2030, helping to reduce carbon emissions by 153,000 tonnes over the next six years.

The airline plans to sign a memorandum of understanding with PTT Oil and Retail Business Plc to ensure sufficient supply in the future.

Even though SAF costs more than twice the price of Jet A-1, it should not significantly impact passenger airfares as the blending portion is only 1%, he said.

With its entire fleet expected to change to Boeing B737-8s, he said the new aircraft model would cut fuel consumption by more than 15% compared to existing Airbus A320s.

However, the first delivery has been postponed four times this year, with the latest obstacle stemming from the US government shutdown, which is now the longest in American history.

Mr Woranate said the airline has been told that the first two planes would be delivered this month.

These planes will take 2-3 weeks for registration and should be ready to operate before Christmas this year.

The airline hopes to receive another five aircraft in December, and another two in January, a month behind schedule.

For the whole of next year, the airline should receive 13 new planes, followed by more than 10 jets in 2027 to fulfil its goal of having 50 aircraft by 2028.

As thousands of passengers were impacted by rescheduled flights due to delayed delivery, including direct routes from Bangkok to Tokyo (Narita) and Osaka, Mr Woranate said the airline would ensure that those tickets were fully refunded or rerouted to other connecting flights on Vietjet networks.

Saf, or Sustainable Aviation Fuel, refers to renewable or waste-derived fuel that meets established environmental standards.
India’s strong technology base and large biomass reserves give it a strategic edge in developing a domestic SAF industry, Westermeier observed.
However, he cautioned that high production costs remain a hurdle, with Saf currently priced at two to four times the cost of conventional aviation turbine fuel.
Calling for coordinated action, Westermeier said, “This is a moment that demands unprecedented collaboration between government, industry, and academia to make sustainable aviation a reality.”","Airbus has called on the Indian government to bring corporate spending on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Saf) initiatives within the ambit of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) framework, arguing that such investments directly contribute to climate change mitigation and energy transition.

Speaking at an industry forum, Jürgen Westermeier, President and Managing Director of Airbus for India and South Asia, said voluntary Saf programmes being launched by Indian airlines offer a tangible way for corporates to participate in decarbonising aviation. “These are measurable, outcome-based investments in sustainability. Recognising them under CSR would encourage greater corporate participation and accelerate India’s shift towards cleaner skies,” he said.

Saf, or Sustainable Aviation Fuel, refers to renewable or waste-derived fuel that meets established environmental standards. It can cut lifecycle carbon emissions from flights by up to 80 per cent compared with conventional jet fuel, according to industry estimates.

Corporate Role In Creating Demand

Westermeier urged Indian businesses to support the nascent SAF ecosystem by joining voluntary purchase programmes being rolled out by airlines. “Even committing to buy Saf for a fraction of your company’s travel sends a strong and immediate demand signal to the market,” he noted.

He said scaling up Saf production could yield both economic and environmental dividends, with the potential to create between 1.1 million and 1.4 million jobs and enable productive use of about 230 million tonnes of agricultural residue annually.

India’s strong technology base and large biomass reserves give it a strategic edge in developing a domestic SAF industry, Westermeier observed. However, he cautioned that high production costs remain a hurdle, with Saf currently priced at two to four times the cost of conventional aviation turbine fuel.

The shift to SAF is also tied to international commitments under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia), which aims to cap aviation emissions globally. India, which has opted out of Corsia’s voluntary phase, will be subject to mandatory offsetting requirements in 2027.

The government has already indicated plans to introduce blending targets for SAF — one per cent in 2027, two per cent in 2028, and five per cent by 2030.

The plan includes a series of measures designed to increase the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and marine biofuels, with the goal of reducing carbon emissions in these critical industries, reports Biodiesel Magazine.

Approach to boost renewable and low-carbon fuels

The STIP is expected to mobilize at least EUR 2.9 billion ($3.33 billion) by 2027, with a significant portion of this funding directed toward overcoming investment barriers and closing the financial gaps in the transition to cleaner energy. Key funding initiatives include at least EUR 2 billion, mobilized through InvestEU, dedicated to sustainable alternative fuels, which will play a crucial role in supporting the sector’s decarbonization efforts in the short term.

Additionally, the European Commission plans to propose EUR 300 million by 2025 to support hydrogen production for SAF and sustainable maritime fuel (SMF), to be managed through the European Hydrogen Bank. Research and innovation will also receive a boost, with approximately EUR 133 million allocated under the Horizon Europe program. Further, the Commission intends to mobilize EUR 153 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects and EUR 293 million for maritime fuel initiatives under the Innovation Fund.

One of the key components of the STIP is the launch of the eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project before the end of 2025. This project is designed to mobilize at least EUR 500 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects, aimed at stimulating early investment in the sector.

The Commission’s plan also seeks to strengthen international collaborations to boost global production of sustainable fuels while ensuring that EU investments are protected and that fair competition is maintained for European fuel producers and users.

To meet the fuel targets set by the ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime regulations, the European Commission estimates that approximately 12.2 million metric tons of biofuels and 6.8 million metric tons of e-fuels will be required. The market will need to invest an estimated EUR 100 billion by 2035 to reach these production volumes.

Speaking at the India Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit-2025 in New Delhi, Naidu said the government’s upcoming SAF policy would be a crucial step towards balancing growth with environmental responsibility. The event is being organised by the Civil Aviation Ministry, in collaboration with FICCI.

The minister highlighted that the transition towards cleaner aviation fuel required greater innovation, investment and global partnerships. “The move from feedstock to fuel will connect farmers with flyers. Even used cooking oil from everyday kitchens could become part of this new green aviation journey,” the minister remarked, underlining the potential of waste-to-fuel technology.

India has set clear blending targets for the use of SAF in jet fuel, 1 % by 2027, 2 % by 2028 and 5 % by 2030. SAF can be used as a drop-in replacement for conventional Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), making it an immediately viable option for airlines.

Highlighting the opportunities within the sector, Naidu said private firms must actively participate in the production of SAF alongside public oil companies. With a global requirement of 183 million tonnes of SAF projected by 2040, India’s participation could play a decisive role in shaping the future of sustainable aviation.

The minister pointed out that the country has access to over 750 million tonnes of biomass and about 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue, which can be effectively used as feedstock for fuel production.

Naidu said the adoption of SAF would not only help India cut its crude oil import bill by an estimated USD 5-7 billion annually but could also create more than one million green jobs across the value chain. “The shift will empower farmers, potentially raising their incomes by 10-15 %,” he added.

Currently, the global production of SAF remains limited. However, Naidu expressed confidence that India could manufacture it at competitive prices, thereby positioning itself as a key player in the sustainable aviation market.

India is among the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world, with domestic airlines collectively ordering over 1,700 aircraft. Naidu said that adopting SAF on a large scale would be crucial in ensuring that this rapid expansion does not come at the cost of environmental sustainability.",https://www.tribuneindia.com/sortd-service/imaginary/v22-01/jpg/large/high?url=dGhldHJpYnVuZS1zb3J0ZC1wcm8tcHJvZC1zb3J0ZC9tZWRpYWM4ZDk2ODIwLWJiNTktMTFmMC1iMDY0LWVkNWUyYTYzNDljNy5qcGc=,N,,2025-11-06 17:16:33.467909

In partnership with the Washington State Department of Commerce, we co-lead a group of 13 state agencies to identify actions to improve siting and permitting of clean energy projects.

The Clean Energy Council just issued a new report with recommendations for the governor and state legislature, developed with input from Tribes, industry, and interested parties. They address concerns such as limitations of the state’s electrical grid, planning for emerging technologies, and supporting Tribal clean energy projects and local government planning.

State agency actions on clean energy

Washington has already taken many strides to reach our clean energy goals. Our electricity needs are expected to double by 2050 with even more needed for large energy users, like data centers, and more action is needed. Agencies are improving customer service and providing information for developers of clean energy projects and the public on existing and new technologies.

In the past year, Washington has taken action to move clean energy forward including:

Providing funding for agencies, local governments, Tribes, and communities to work on clean energy planning, siting, environmental reviews, and permitting.

Finalizing statewide environmental studies for utility-scale solar and onshore wind energy projects and green hydrogen facilities – and providing tools to use them.

Studying rural clean energy economics.

Launching a collaborative process to identify opportunities and risks of geothermal energy.

Improving customer service and ideas for consolidating clean energy permits.

Building best practices for community and Tribal benefit agreements and developing an environmental justice toolkit for hydrogen projects.

Reporting on the emerging technologies of nuclear fusion and sustainable aviation fuel.

Recommended next steps

Building on the recommendations in the first annual report, the council developed new ideas that further advance the state’s energy policies. Recent changes at the federal level, as well as state and federal funding constraints, will affect clean energy development in Washington state.

Given the urgent need for clean energy to meet the rising state electricity demand, the council developed meaningful recommendations. These could be implemented with legislative direction or funding to enact.

The electrical grid provides clean energy to users across the state but is reaching its capacity in many places. The recommendations are to establish a state entity to develop and finance transmission projects, develop tools for siting and permitting, and improving existing electrical lines.

The council's recommendations include:

Supporting clean energy development through incentives for upgrades.

Promoting Tribal clean energy projects.

Looking at options that do not rely on the electrical grid.

Supporting Tribes with long-term funding.

Engaging Tribes early in actions that affect their resources.

Supporting local governments in clean energy planning and for dealing with emerging. technologies.

Public lands available for energy development could be assessed and tools for engaging with local communities would improve information sharing. A collaborative process for looking at risks and opportunities for geothermal energy has started, but more work could be done to gather data for these types of resources.

We believe these actions will improve siting and permitting of clean energy in Washington state and help meet our goals for a clean energy transition.

Opportunities for input

Our goals include promoting understanding, awareness, and visibility into the council's work. We hold workshops with interested parties and Tribes in the spring and fall to provide updates, hear issues and ideas, and share recommendation ideas. In the summer, we shared draft recommendations for comment and input on the annual report.

SOURCE: XCF Global, Inc. View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire","HOUSTON, TEXAS / ACCESS Newswire / November 6, 2025 / XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF"") was featured in a white paper titled, ""Unlocking the Full Value of Renewable Fuel Facilities: Powering the Future with Posh Flex Gensets"" written by Posh Robotics (""Posh"" dba Posh Energy), an advanced clean energy company founded by Stanford alumni and backed by Y-Combinator. As previously announced, XCF and Posh have signed a Letter of Intent (""LOI"") to explore deploying Posh's Flex Gensets at our New Rise Reno renewable fuels facility.

Posh's white paper provides its economic and technical roadmap for integrating Posh Energy's Flex Gensets into SAF and renewable diesel (""RD"") facilities, such as at XCF's New Rise Reno facility. Posh's analysis shows how producers using its Flex Gensets process can convert propane-rich byproduct streams, typically ~8% of total output, into renewable electricity, transforming a flared or low-value stream into a source of zero-carbon power.

Further, the white paper demonstrates how integrating Posh Flex Gensets into SAF and RD production may be able to deliver both economic and environmental benefits today, while advancing the industry's trajectory toward eSAF and fuels with near-zero - or even negative - carbon intensity (""CI"").

From Byproducts to Profits

The white paper highlights how incorporating Posh's Flex Gensets at facilities such as XCF's New Rise Reno facility has the potential to turn SAF and renewable fuel facilities into integrated energy hubs, producing not only renewable fuel but also clean power and food-grade CO₂. The result is the opportunity to create diversified revenue streams, stronger credit generation, and measurable margin growth.

By replacing grid power with on-site renewable electricity, producers have the potential to reduce lifecycle carbon intensity (CI), boost Section 45Z and Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits, and strengthen energy resilience for both operations and power grids.

In addition to enhancing the value of its renewable fuels, the white paper illustrates that integrating Posh's Flex Gensets has the potential to deliver:

Improvement in operating margin, driven by electricity sales and eligibility for the Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit

Additional revenue streams through the sale of biogenic, food-grade CO₂ with market prices as high as $700 per metric ton, equating to approximately $0.22 per gallon of added value

Up to 80% higher electrical efficiency and near-zero local emissions

Advancing XCF's Growth Model

The white paper builds on the LOI signed in September 2025, which outlines plans for a 100 kW pilot deployment of Posh's Flex Gensets at the New Rise Reno facility, followed by a modular scale-up to 10 MW of installed capacity.

The non-binding LOI reflects a shared vision to convert byproducts from the production of renewable fuels into zero-carbon electricity, unlocking the full value of production while advancing both sustainability and profitability goals. Execution remains subject to customary due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

Mihir Dange, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented:

""Our potential partnership with Posh Energy to deploy Flex Gensets at New Rise Reno demonstrates how renewable fuel facilities can evolve into next-generation, integrated energy platforms. By eliminating flaring and converting propane byproducts into zero-carbon electricity, we have the opportunity to both improve margin and create a circular economy where every drop of feedstock delivers value.""

Wesley Zheng, Co-founder and CEO of Posh Energy, commented:

""Our Flex Gensets make the energy transition practical - turning hard-to-process waste streams into clean, reliable powerwith 80% higher efficiency. Working with XCF validates how this technology can simultaneously decarbonize operations and open new, credit-backed revenue opportunities for SAF and renewable fuel producers worldwide.""

A Broader Vision

The white paper also highlights the opportunity for renewable fuel producers to help address one of the decade's biggest infrastructure challenges - the surging electricity demand from AI and hyperscale data centers, which now account for an estimated 44 percent of U.S. electricity load growth.

Over $1 trillion is expected to be invested in new U.S. data center infrastructure by 2030, and much of that growth will be constrained by limited grid interconnection capacity. By deploying Posh Flex Gensets, SAF and renewable fuel producers can help stabilize regional grids while monetizing byproducts that were previously wasted, positioning themselves as essential players in the decarbonization of both transportation and digital infrastructure.

With its rapidly expanding aviation sectorâcurrently the fifth largest worldwide and expected to rise to third place by 2030âthe nation is uniquely positioned to lead in SAF production. This shift is supported by ambitious government mandates requiring a minimum blend of 1 percent SAF by 2027, increasing to 2 percent by 2028, and reaching 5 percent by 2030.
 The report highlights Indiaâs vast potential through its rich availability of renewable feedstocks. The country generates over 680 million metric tons of agricultural residue annually, along with 3.4 million metric tons of used cooking oil and an ethanol production capacity surpassing 1,800 crore liters. These resources form a robust foundation for scaling up SAF manufacturing while simultaneously addressing environmental challenges and boosting rural economies.
 Sustainable aviation fuels offer significant climate benefits, capable of reducing lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. As one of the most practical and scalable solutions for decarbonizing air travel, SAF represents a critical step toward achieving net-zero goals in the aviation industry. The report outlines a comprehensive roadmap emphasizing the importance of integrating policy support, financial incentives, technological innovation, and secure off-take agreements among stakeholders.
 Beyond environmental gains, the transition to SAF promises substantial economic returns. It could significantly cut down on fuel import dependency, save billions in foreign exchange, create employment opportunities in emerging green industries, and increase income for farmers and rural populations involved in biomass collection and processing.
 India also stands ready to tap into lucrative international markets, including the European Union, Japan, Singapore, and the Middle East, where demand for low-carbon aviation fuels is rising due to stringent carbon regulations and sustainability commitments. Experts stress that successful implementation hinges on building resilient supply chains and securing long-term contracts between airlines, oil marketing companies, and technology partners.
 Anish De, Global Head of Energy, Natural Resources & Chemicals at KPMG India, emphasized the necessity of a holistic strategy that brings together policymakers, financiers, innovators, and end-users. Vivek Rahi, Partner and National Head â Oil & Gas at KPMG India, noted that leveraging diverse domestic feedstocksâfrom crop waste and urban refuse to sugarcane press mud and recycled oilsâis central to this transformation.

The long road to the zero emission aircraft of the future has been a long one, but the nut has finally begun to crack around the edges. In the latest development, the EU Innovation Fund has greenlighted a €21.4 million grant to the US-UK firm ZeroAvia. The funds will support a pilot project under which ZeroAvia will retrofit 15 Cessna Caravan aircraft with its ZA600 hydrogen fuel cell electric engines.

The Fuel Cell Chicken & Egg Problem

If you’re wondering where the hydrogen fuel will come from, that’s a good question. It’s similar to the questions raised when battery-electric cars first came on the scene, before EV charging stations became as commonplace as gas stations, or even more so considering the popularity of home EV charging.

Advocates for hydrogen fuel cell technology are facing a similar chicken-and-egg obstacle, and the EU grant also covers that. Under the title ODIN (short for Operations to Decarbonize Interconnectivity in Norway), the project involves outfitting 15 Norwegian airports with hydrogen refueling and storage facilities.

The ODIN project also faces another hurdle that bears some similarity to the EV situation of years gone by, when recharging a battery often meant tapping into a grid saturated with coal and natural gas. Fuel cell aircraft produce no emissions except water vapor, but the global hydrogen supply chain leans almost entirely on natural gas, with coal also involved to a lesser extent.

More Green Hydrogen For Fuel Cell Aircraft

The hydrogen supply chain is beginning to decarbonize, with the European Commission among the government bodies supporting a new, green supply chain based on renewable resources. On its part, ZeroAvia has also focused attention on securing a supply of green hydrogen for its fuel cell aircraft while cutting the cost of green hydrogen as well (see more ZeroAvia background here).

Green hydrogen or not, the impact on direct aircraft emissions from the retrofitted Caravans will be significant. “These zero-emission aircraft are planned to replace conventional kerosene-fueled turboprops on cargo routes and expected to see in excess of 95% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions,” ZeroAvia states.

The Cessna Caravan is rather small in size, reflecting the current state of fuel cell electric flight. However, the ODIN project is significant as the first introduction of hydrogen fuel cell aircraft into the European Economic Area. ZeroAvia is already billing the 15 airports in Norway as the “world’s largest network of zero-emission commercial flights.” ODIN is also expected to spur scaleup activity among other regional transportation networks elsewhere.

“The ODIN project aims to validate the technical performance and economic case for utilizing hydrogen-electric aircraft in commercial operations, with a view to catalyzing further adoption in Norway, across the EU and further afield,” ZeroAvia elaborates.

Next Steps For Zero Emission Flight

The ODIN grant is still in the preparatory stage for finalizing the agreement. If all goes according to plan, the network will be up and running in 2028.

Meanwhile, ZeroAvia has been working to scale up fuel cell flight for passengers. Currently in the works for certification is an engine designed for aircraft of up to 20 seats, and a larger version aimed at the 40-80 seat market.

That’s an impressive jump up from the 6-seat aircraft ZeroAvia launched in 2020. However, even 80 seats is nowhere near the scale of today’s airliners. Long distance travel also remains a distant goal. In the meantime, the company has retooled its business model to sync up with the emerging market for unconventional aircraft.

“Separately, hydrogen is picking up new impetus in other segments of aviation thanks to a unique set of drivers: new approaches to regulation, a thirst for greater endurance of novel electrical aircraft, such as electric Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and corresponding space and weight efficiency advances in low-to-mid power modular hydrogen fuel cell systems,” ZeroAvia explains.

In particular, ZeroAvia takes note of the new MOSAIC (Modernization of Special Airworthiness Certification) rule introduced by the Federal Aviation Administration in August.

The new rule provides for additional design flexibility by removing the weight limit and allowing up to four seats in the general aviation category. “Qualifying aircraft are no longer limited to single piston engines, opening up the opportunity to certify these with new electric and hydrogen-electric powertrains,” ZeroAvia emphasizes.

Fuel Cells Vs. Batteries

As a singular advocate for fuel cell flight, ZeroAvia pulls no punches against the competition from battery-electric stakeholders, particularly in the rush to take advantage of new opportunities under the MOSAIC rule.

“Replacing battery power systems with hydrogen fuel cells can significantly extend range, reduce maintenance costs caused by battery cycling, and improve operations thanks to quicker turnaround time,” ZeroAvia asserts.

If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. The big question is whether or not fuel cell propulsion can compete on cost. In that regard, ZeroAvia is banking on its new “SuperStack Flex” modular fuel cell system to give it an edge in the light-sport and eVTOL (electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing) markets.

“SuperStack Flex offers scalable power output, is compact and lightweight to meet aviation’s strict weight and space constraints, and allows flexible integration, making it compatible with both conventional and unconventional aircraft structures,” ZeroAvia asserts.

Fuel Cells Vs. Batteries Vs. SAF

Looming over both fuel cell and battery-electric flight is the SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) industry, which aims to provide drop-in liquid replacements for kerosene jet fuel based on renewable resources, recovered wastes, or both.

Progress in that area has been slow and partly hampered by land use issues involving energy crops. By 2021, though, the US Air Force was among the advanced aviation stakeholders supporting a whole new supply chain, consisting of drop-in liquid fuels synthesized from green hydrogen and captured carbon. By 2022 Texas (of course) was already emerging as a hotspot for electrofuels innovation.

In one variation on the topic, earlier this year the Swiss firm Metafuels described a flexible e-fuels system powered by electricity sourced from renewable resources. “Green H2 can be generated from water electrolysis driven by renewable electricity while CO2 can be removed from the atmosphere using direct air capture technology (DAC) or captured from other biogenic sources,” Metafuels explained, noting that its system is designed to switch gears depending on feedstock availability.

Competition from existing rail and road transportation networks could also complicate matters for electric aircraft stakeholders.

SOURCE: XCF Global, Inc. View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire","HOUSTON, TEXAS / ACCESS Newswire / November 6, 2025 / XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF"") was featured in a white paper titled, ""Unlocking the Full Value of Renewable Fuel Facilities: Powering the Future with Posh Flex Gensets"" written by Posh Robotics (""Posh"" dba Posh Energy), an advanced clean energy company founded by Stanford alumni and backed by Y-Combinator. As previously announced, XCF and Posh have signed a Letter of Intent (""LOI"") to explore deploying Posh's Flex Gensets at our New Rise Reno renewable fuels facility.

Posh's white paper provides its economic and technical roadmap for integrating Posh Energy's Flex Gensets into SAF and renewable diesel (""RD"") facilities, such as at XCF's New Rise Reno facility. Posh's analysis shows how producers using its Flex Gensets process can convert propane-rich byproduct streams, typically ~8% of total output, into renewable electricity, transforming a flared or low-value stream into a source of zero-carbon power.

Further, the white paper demonstrates how integrating Posh Flex Gensets into SAF and RD production may be able to deliver both economic and environmental benefits today, while advancing the industry's trajectory toward eSAF and fuels with near-zero - or even negative - carbon intensity (""CI"").

From Byproducts to Profits

The white paper highlights how incorporating Posh's Flex Gensets at facilities such as XCF's New Rise Reno facility has the potential to turn SAF and renewable fuel facilities into integrated energy hubs, producing not only renewable fuel but also clean power and food-grade CO₂. The result is the opportunity to create diversified revenue streams, stronger credit generation, and measurable margin growth.

By replacing grid power with on-site renewable electricity, producers have the potential to reduce lifecycle carbon intensity (CI), boost Section 45Z and Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits, and strengthen energy resilience for both operations and power grids.

In addition to enhancing the value of its renewable fuels, the white paper illustrates that integrating Posh's Flex Gensets has the potential to deliver:

Advancing XCF's Growth Model

The white paper builds on the LOI signed in September 2025, which outlines plans for a 100 kW pilot deployment of Posh's Flex Gensets at the New Rise Reno facility, followed by a modular scale-up to 10 MW of installed capacity.

The non-binding LOI reflects a shared vision to convert byproducts from the production of renewable fuels into zero-carbon electricity, unlocking the full value of production while advancing both sustainability and profitability goals. Execution remains subject to customary due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

Mihir Dange, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented:

""Our potential partnership with Posh Energy to deploy Flex Gensets at New Rise Reno demonstrates how renewable fuel facilities can evolve into next-generation, integrated energy platforms. By eliminating flaring and converting propane byproducts into zero-carbon electricity, we have the opportunity to both improve margin and create a circular economy where every drop of feedstock delivers value.""

Wesley Zheng, Co-founder and CEO of Posh Energy, commented:

""Our Flex Gensets make the energy transition practical - turning hard-to-process waste streams into clean, reliable powerwith 80% higher efficiency. Working with XCF validates how this technology can simultaneously decarbonize operations and open new, credit-backed revenue opportunities for SAF and renewable fuel producers worldwide.""

A Broader Vision

The white paper also highlights the opportunity for renewable fuel producers to help address one of the decade's biggest infrastructure challenges - the surging electricity demand from AI and hyperscale data centers, which now account for an estimated 44 percent of U.S. electricity load growth.

Over $1 trillion is expected to be invested in new U.S. data center infrastructure by 2030, and much of that growth will be constrained by limited grid interconnection capacity. By deploying Posh Flex Gensets, SAF and renewable fuel producers can help stabilize regional grids while monetizing byproducts that were previously wasted, positioning themselves as essential players in the decarbonization of both transportation and digital infrastructure.

According to the Commission, however, while EU production capacity of sustainable fuels is on track for the targets from 2025 – 2029, investment planning does not appear sufficient to meet the regulations’ targets after 2030.
Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, said: “Our Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a decisive step towards a sustainable future.
It’s not just about cutting emissions – it’s about building a stronger, more competitive and resilient Europe that leads in sustainable transport.
This ambitious plan shows the Commission’s firm commitment to scaling up renewable and low-carbon fuels in aviation and waterborne transport.”","The European Commission announced the launch of its new Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), setting out its roadmap and planned investments to dramatically accelerate the production of sustainable and low-carbon fuels needed to help reach its aviation and maritime transport sector decarbonization goals.

The new plan follows the adoption in 2023 by EU lawmakers of ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime regulations, setting binding targets to ramp up low-carbon fuel usage in the aviation and maritime shipping sectors, respectively. Targets included in the regulations include a minimum share of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at EU airports, starting a 2% in 2025, and increasing over time to reach 70% by 2050, as well as a minimum share of synthetic fuels starting in 2030 and also increasing through 2050, and for maritime shipping, requirements to gradually reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels, starting with a 2% reduction in 2025, and reaching as much as 80% by 2050.

According to the Commission, however, while EU production capacity of sustainable fuels is on track for the targets from 2025 – 2029, investment planning does not appear sufficient to meet the regulations’ targets after 2030. The Commission added that investments to sufficiently scale up production of renewable and low-carbon fuels will need to reach an estimated €100 billion by 2035.

The Commission said that the new Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is aimed at addressing the barriers to investment to enable the needed increase in production of renewable and low-carbon fuels, in addition to help producers access biological feedstocks for the fuels.

In total, the Commission’s plan aims to mobilize at least €2.9 billion in investments through the end of 2027, with specific investments including at least €2 billion for sustainable alternative fuels through the InvestEU programme, €300 million by end of this year to support the production of hydrogen for SAF and sustainable maritime fuels (SMF) through the European Hydrogen Bank, support from the Commission of around €133 million under Horizon Europe for research and innovation projects, as well as the mobilization of €153 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects and €293 million for maritime fuel projects under the Innovation Fund.

In addition, the Commission announced plans to launch an eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project aimed at mobilizing €500 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects by the end of this year, as well as to establish a mechanism connecting fuel producers and buyers to provide revenue certainty and de-risk investments.

Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, said:

“Our Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a decisive step towards a sustainable future.

It’s not often that Brussels writes a cheque this large for aviation. But this week, the European Union announced that it will spend almost €3 billion ($3.5 billion) over the next two years to give wings to a cleaner, greener future for flight.

The funding, unveiled under the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, marks the EU’s biggest single effort yet to scale up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and cut emissions from air travel.

It comes as Europe’s airlines face tighter climate rules under the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which will require at least 2% of all jet fuel sold in the bloc to be sustainable by 2025, rising to 70% by 2050.

Major EU funding boost for sustainable aviation fuel

The €3 billion package aims to bridge the gap between policy and production. Most of the funding will support efforts to expand Europe’s SAF manufacturing capacity, reduce reliance on imports from the US and Asia, and make green jet fuel affordable enough for widespread airline adoption.

According to officials familiar with the plan, €2 billion ($2.3 billion) will be channelled through the InvestEU programme to build new SAF plants and attract private investment.

Another €133 million ($153 million) will support research under Horizon Europe, focusing on advanced biofuels and synthetic aviation fuels, while €153 million ($176 million) from the Innovation Fund will finance large-scale demonstration projects.

A new “eSAF Early Movers Coalition”, expected to raise around €500 million, will back early production of synthetic e-fuels that can be blended directly with conventional jet fuel.

Europe’s SAF production still faces a steep climb

Despite its global leadership on climate policy, Europe’s actual SAF output remains minimal. The continent currently produces less than 300,000 tonnes per year, compared with the estimated 7 million tonnes needed annually by 2035 to remain on track for net-zero aviation.

The shortfall is driven by the high capital costs of SAF facilities and limited access to sustainable feedstocks. EU officials hope the new investment package will give private investors the confidence to scale up quickly.

A significant focus of the plan lies in synthetic e-fuels, produced by combining captured carbon dioxide with hydrogen generated from renewable power. These fuels can be used in today’s aircraft engines and refuelling infrastructure, an advantage over hydrogen or battery-electric aircraft, which remain years from commercial adoption.

To accelerate development, Brussels plans to hold its first “pooled double auction” in 2026. The mechanism will match fuel producers with guaranteed buyers at pre-agreed prices, giving investors the long-term certainty needed for commercial-scale production.

Industry experts say this could finally create a viable market for synthetic aviation fuels, replacing the cycle of pilot projects that fail to reach maturity.

Safeguarding Europe’s leadership in sustainable aviation

The European Commission also sees the investment as a way to reinforce the continent’s aerospace competitiveness.

By leading the global shift to SAF, Brussels hopes to strengthen companies such as Airbus, Rolls-Royce, and Safran, which are already testing aircraft and engines certified for 100% SAF use.

In a statement, Airbus said the new plan “will help ensure that fuel availability keeps pace with certification and airline demand.”

Rolls-Royce, which has completed multiple SAF trials across its engine families, called the initiative “crucial for maintaining momentum in decarbonising long-haul aviation.”

What’s next for Europe’s SAF expansion?

The European Commission will now finalise project lists with member states and private-sector partners. The first funding rounds under InvestEU are expected in early 2026, targeting plants capable of producing several hundred thousand tonnes of sustainable fuel per year.

Over time, Brussels aims to create a fully integrated European SAF market with harmonised standards, stable pricing mechanisms, and commercial viability at scale.

As one EU transport adviser put it:

“Aviation’s green transition won’t happen overnight. But this investment starts the engines—and keeps Europe in the pilot’s seat.”",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Air-France-Sustainable-aviation-Fuel.jpeg,N,,2025-11-06 12:01:37.059934

With the EU's binding climate goal of achieving climate-neutrality by 2050, compared to 1990 levels, slashing emissions in aviation and maritime transport is both essential and challenging for the EU27.

Commercial planes and ships are the hardest transports to decarbonise, and to this day they are still powered mainly by fossil fuels, despite EU legislation meant to help the shipping and aviation sectors to become climate-neutral.

""The package is about strengthening Europe’s competitiveness while moving decisively towards a net-zero future. By investing in scaling up renewable and low-carbon fuels, we are making Europe’s transport system cleaner, more resilient and more affordable for citizens,"" said Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas.

The EU executive estimates that around 20 million tonnes of sustainable fuels, including biofuels and e-fuels, will be needed by 2035 to meet green fuel targets for aviation and maritime transport. Achieving this will require an estimated €100 billion in investment, the Commission stated.

The nearly €3 billion announced on Wednesday is expected to be disbursed from the EU's multiannual budget, running until 2027, to be invested in renewable and low-carbon fuel technologies.

Under existing EU law, the maritime sector must reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2% from 2025, compared to 2020 levels. By 2050, shipping is expected to reduce its GHG intensity by 80%.

The aviation sector is expected to have 20% of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — feedstocks like used cooking oil, agricultural waste and captured carbon — supplied at EU airports from 2035. Five per cent needs to be e-SAF — a type of synthetic jet fuel made from carbon dioxide, water, and renewable electricity.

By 2050, green fuels for aviation must account for 70%, of which 35% must be eSAF.

However, available and estimated volumes of bio and e-SAF are far from meeting the post-2030 green fuel needs for aviation, according to the Commission.

""Mandates alone do not create a functioning SAF market, and it is high time we collectively admit that and take action to accelerate affordable SAF,” Ourania Georgoutsakou, managing director of the aviation lobby group Airlines for Europe (A4E), said in a statement.

""Ultimately, reducing SAF costs is essential to ensuring air travel remains accessible to all while reinforcing the competitiveness of European airlines,"" A4E stated.

e-fuels and biofuels

More than 40 e-fuel production projects are at a planning stage in the EU, but none have yet reached a final investment decision, the Commission said.

Challenges in scaling up e-fuels are hampered by the availability, cost and maturity of renewable energy, eligible carbon storage and capture technologies and the energy intensity linked to generating green hydrogen.

Antony Froggatt, senior director for aviation, shipping and energy at the campaign group T&E, welcomed the Commission's plan and the inclusion of e-fuels.

“For the first time, the EU will develop an effective financial instrument to kickstart production. The EU must now follow through on these commitments if it is to help preserve Europe’s technological leadership in e-fuels,"" Froggatt said.

Concerns were raised about the use of biofuels, which Froggatt said would only ""detract from"" commitments to e-fuels.

""It is crucial that only e-fuels be eligible for the auctions as there are no market barriers for biofuels production"", T&E stated, in reference to the European Hydrogen Bank auction due by the end of the year with a €300 million window for aviation and maritime projects. This is part of the €2.9 billion unveiled by the Commission.

Jim Corbett, World Shipping Council’s (WSC) environmental director, said the Commission's plan was a ""promising first step"" to accelerate the energy transition in shipping in Europe.

""WSC is eager to work with the Commission to ensure the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan translates to concrete measures that bridge the cost gap between renewable marine fuels and conventional bunkers.

Harris studies zeolites, a class of microporous crystalline oxides typically comprised of silicon and aluminum. Zeolites have a rigid, porous structure that can host active sites that enable chemical reactions necessary to transform ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel.

Harris plans to work with researchers from Johns Hopkins University to computationally model yttrium’s structure and compare it to his data on how it behaves in experiments.

A senior IATA official warned that mandates for blending sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) without incentives are a ""no-go area"" that would harm airlines. India aims for 1% SAF blending by 2027, but IATA advocates for incentives to boost SAF production before imposing mandates. The government is developing a SAF policy to reduce oil imports and create green jobs.

Mandates for blending sustainable aviation fuel with jet fuel without incentives are a ""no-go area"" and such a situation would hurt airlines, a senior IATA official said on Thursday amid authorities pushing ahead with efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

The government has set a target to have 1 per cent blending of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028 and 5 per cent by 2030 for international flights. India is one of the world's fastest-growing civil aviation markets, and with the availability of feedstock, the country also has significant potential for producing SAF.

Globally, the requirement for SAF is estimated at 183 million tonnes by 2040.

Tuhin Sen, Head Sustainability India at IATA, said IATA would prefer to have incentives for a technological push for producing SAF to precede the mandate for the use of SAF.

Mandates for blending of SAF without incentives are a ""no-go area"" and will have unintended consequences as airlines are also enablers for connectivity and growth, he noted.

Live Events

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) represents around 350 airlines, including Indian carriers, worldwide that account for more than 80 per cent of the global air traffic.

Participating in a panel discussion as part of the 'India Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit' that was organised in the national capital on Thursday, Sen also mentioned that for airlines, currently, Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) accounts for around 44 per cent of the overall operating costs while the quantum is around 34 per cent globally.

At the panel discussion, Asangba Chuba Ao, Joint Secretary at the Ministry of Civil Aviation, emphasised the need for a multi-pronged approach and that there was no ""silver bullet"" to address the issues.

The government is open to suggestions, he said with respect to developing the SAF ecosystem.

Earlier in the day,Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan Naidu said the government will very soon come out with a policy on SAF, which can help reduce crude oil imports, increase farmers' income and create more green jobs.

""From feedstock to fuel, from farmers to flyers, and from frying to flying, who would have actually imagined that (those) frying samosas also can participate in this whole global aviation movement (on SAF),"" Naidu said.

India has more than 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue.

The global aviation safety watchdog International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) aims to reduce CO2 emissions in international aviation by 5% by 2030, and reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. India too has set targets to blend SAF into its international flights, starting with a 1% blend by 2027, increasing to 2% by 2028, and reaching 5% by 2030 under ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) programme.

In a bold move to lead the world into a cleaner aviation era, the country is now aiming to eliminate fossil fuels from its airspace. Hybrid-powered jets, built to run entirely on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), are being developed with a goal to end fossil fuel dependency in flights. The real game-changer? Sweden’s ES-30 — a 30-seater hybrid-electric plane that blends electric and SAF tech to fly into a greener future.

Commitment

Sweden isn’t just flirting with the idea of clean aviation — it’s all in. The country has laid out a clear path toward replacing fossil jet fuel with 100% SAF for all domestic flights within the next decade. This move ties directly into Sweden’s broader climate target of becoming net-zero by 2045.

Aviation, traditionally a heavy polluter, has long lagged behind in sustainability. Sweden is flipping that script with its SAF initiative. Unlike regular jet fuel, SAF is made from renewable sources like used cooking oils, agricultural residues, and even captured carbon dioxide. It’s not just a cleaner option — it’s a smarter one.

Innovation

At the center of Sweden’s clean aviation mission is the ES-30. Developed by Swedish startup Heart Aerospace, the ES-30 is a hybrid-electric aircraft that seats 30 passengers. It’s tailor-made for regional travel, especially suited for short routes like those connecting remote regions with major cities.

This jet is designed to operate on a full-electric range of 32 km, and up to 200 km using its hybrid SAF engine. It’s ideal for daily essential flights to islands like Gotland, which rely on consistent air travel to the mainland.

Partnerships

Sweden is building a full ecosystem around its green aviation dream. Airports like Säve in Gothenburg are upgrading facilities to support electric and SAF-powered planes. We’re talking about charging stations, battery safety zones, and SAF blending hubs — all ready to go.

Meanwhile, authorities are fast-tracking new regulatory frameworks. The current aviation certification systems, still tied to fossil-fueled aircraft, are being overhauled to meet the needs of electric aviation. It’s a ground-up rebuild of how flight is done.

Infrastructure

To pull off a national shift to clean aviation, infrastructure is everything. Sweden knows that it’s not just about the aircraft — it’s about the full supply chain. The country is working closely with airlines, airport operators, energy providers, and tech startups to ensure SAF can be produced, delivered, and refueled at scale.

In fact, agreements have already been signed with companies like Elfly Group, and airfields are getting equipped with all the tools needed to support hybrid-electric jets.

Here’s a look at how the aviation upgrade is shaping up:

Regulation

To make this dream fly, Sweden is rewriting aviation laws. Outdated certifications don’t support SAF and electric aircraft. That’s why Sweden’s transport and environmental regulators are partnering with research institutions and private aviation players to develop fast-track approval systems.

Over 100 projects are underway — from SAF testing to air taxi development. Sweden’s aviation rulebook is being reimagined for a carbon-free future.

Vision

This isn’t just about reducing carbon — it’s about eliminating fossil fuels altogether. Sweden wants to be the first country where commercial flights operate without burning a single drop of fossil jet fuel. And with SAF that’s proven to be cleaner, easier to produce, and more practical than hydrogen or all-electric propulsion, that future feels within reach.

Gotland, one of Sweden’s more remote areas, is already leading the charge, proving that even the most isolated regions can plug into this new system. The journey to the skies now comes with a lighter footprint.

With this SAF revolution, Sweden is setting a powerful example for the world. The vision is clear: sustainable skies, clean engines, and fossil-free flying. This isn’t a pipe dream. It’s already taking off.

Instead, the focus is on biomass-based diesel (often called soy diesel).
Dr. Hubbs explained that the EPA was “more stringent” in granting new exemptions than the previous administration.
This combination of stringent new rules and reallocation is “helpful” for the agriculture sector and points to “really strong growth” for biomass-based diesel.
Leveling the Playing Field Finally, the EPA also adjusted the credit values to put different types of biomass-based diesel on a more equal footing.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been “extraordinarily active” in 2025, making three significant changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) that are poised to reshape the biomass-based diesel market.

University of Illinois, Todd Gleason spoke to agricultural economists Dr. Todd Hubbs of Oklahoma State University and Dr. Scott Irwin of the University of Illinois, who outlined how these complex rulings create strong incentives for domestic soybean oil and other feedstocks.

“It has been something this year,” Hubbs said, detailing the EPA’s recent actions.

The changes, which are the focus of a new series of articles by Hubbs and Irwin, include:

June: The EPA finalized the Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) for 2026 and 2027.

July: The agency released a comprehensive ruling on Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) that had been pending since 2018.

September: The EPA established a new framework for reallocating those SREs.

The Mandate is Growing

Host Todd Gleason clarified that these changes do not impact the 15-billion-gallon component of the RFS, which is generally met by corn-based ethanol. Instead, the focus is on biomass-based diesel (often called soy diesel).

The mandate for this category is set for a 40% increase, rising from 5.36 billion gallons annually to 7.5 billion gallons by 2027.

A “Messy” Solution to Small Refinery Exemptions

A major part of the EPA’s recent action was resolving the backlog of SREs, which allow small refineries to get out of the RFS mandate.

Dr. Hubbs explained that the EPA was “more stringent” in granting new exemptions than the previous administration. For the exemptions it did grant (covering 2018-2022), the agency returned “worthless” RINs (Renewable Identification Numbers, or credits) from those past years, rather than current, valuable RINs. This effectively removed those credits from the marketplace.

“That’s a mess,” Hubbs said, summarizing the complex situation.

Crucially, the EPA’s new “reallocation” policy means that the exempted gallons will be added back into the RFS, making other, non-exempt obligated parties responsible for making up the difference in 2026 and 2027.

This combination of stringent new rules and reallocation is “helpful” for the agriculture sector and points to “really strong growth” for biomass-based diesel. Hubbs projects the mandate could jump from 5.5 billion RIN gallons in 2025 to over 7.23 billion in 2026.

“Half-RIN” Policy Favors Domestic Production

Perhaps the most significant change, according to Hubbs, was the introduction of a “half-RIN policy” in June, which he described as “unheard of previously.”

Under this new rule, any imported fuel or imported feedstock used to make fuel will only receive half the RIN value.

“Well, that sort of totally favors it, right?” Gleason asked.

Hubbs agreed, noting the policy “sort of favors domestic feedstock and domestic production” and has “big implications” for U.S. producers.

Leveling the Playing Field

Finally, the EPA also adjusted the credit values to put different types of biomass-based diesel on a more equal footing.

The agency lowered the RIN value for non-ester renewable diesel (and Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF) from 1.7 RINs per gallon down to 1.6. This brings it closer to traditional FAME (soy diesel), which has a 1.5 RINs-per-gallon value.

Hubbs and Irwin plan to release additional articles detailing the implications of these changes for feedstock prices as they continue to analyze the new RFS playbook.

Steps towards the net-zero future Starting the decarbonisation journey means realising that every significant transformation begins with a first step.","For organisations beginning their decarbonisation journey, a strong start is vital to build lasting momentum. Carolina Paes, Climate Consultant at Nexio Projects, shares five key tips to help spark ambition and set initiatives firmly on the right path.

1. Measure from the start

No decarbonisation strategy can advance without a clear picture of today’s emissions. A full carbon footprint measurement, covering Scope 1, Scope 2, and relevant parts of Scope 3, will reveal where the biggest impacts lie.

Scope 3 is where many businesses find unexpected challenges. Upstream suppliers, distribution networks, and product lifecycles often account for most emissions. Tackling these early, even with high-level estimates, ensures action plans are grounded in reality and not assumption.

This step forms the backbone of carbon accounting and builds credibility with stakeholders who expect reliable disclosure.

2. Build a coalition of stakeholders

Effective decarbonisation requires collective engagement – achieving net zero is rarely achieved in isolation. Stakeholder mapping allows you to identify champions and potential blockers.

Invest time to understand:

Who influences strategic decision-making

Which departments drive the largest emissions

Which suppliers or customers are critical in shaping carbon outcomes

This coalition-building is not about bureaucracy; it is about positioning sustainability at the centre of organisational DNA. When stakeholders feel informed and involved, carbon reduction targets move from paper commitments to cultural practice.

Source: Nexio Projects

3. Set ambitious yet achievable targets

Targets give direction, but they must be credible. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) provides a framework to ensure emissions targets are science-aligned rather than arbitrary. A decarbonisation strategy that adopts the SBTi communicates a clear message to investors and employees: “Our ambition is real, not symbolic.”

The most effective targets are structured in layers:

Near-term achievable milestones, such as energy efficiency and low-carbon procurement

Longer-term net-zero sustainability goals, covering full value chains

This journey of ambition, supported by data, enables organisations to build a resilient reputation on climate leadership.

4. Integrate risk management into decisions

Climate-related risks are no longer abstract. They translate into tangible financial, operational, and legal consequences. By embedding risk management into the decarbonisation journey, businesses can identify vulnerabilities early.

For example, energy price volatility can amplify costs for carbon-intensive operations, while shifting regulations such as carbon taxes impose new liabilities. Mapping these risks during the early stages allows leaders to develop a proactive, future-proof decarbonisation strategy.

With these foresight mechanisms, organisations protect both their operations and their credibility.

5. Celebrate momentum through tangible action

The worst mistake at the beginning is to wait for a perfect plan. Decarbonisation gains momentum through tangible first steps, not elaborate strategies that never leave the page.

Introduce immediate actions such as:

Switching to renewable electricity contracts

Improving building energy efficiency

Revisiting staff travel policies

Every action reinforces internal belief and builds external trust. These early achievements serve as proof points that cultivating carbon neutrality goes beyond the theoretical – and can be achieved starting today.

Steps towards the net-zero future

Starting the decarbonisation journey means realising that every significant transformation begins with a first step. By measuring emissions, building coalitions, setting science-based targets, embedding risk management, and acting with immediacy, organisations lay the foundation for credible climate leadership.

The evidence-based review, titled Oil-Based Cover Crops for Aviation Fuel in Scotland – Question and Answer Report, assesses the feasibility of cultivating oil-producing crops for biofuel production.
“Camelina, particularly winter grown camelina, is a relatively novel crop for Scotland,” said Dr. Tracy Valentine, Project Lead and Senior Research Scientist.
“This work will help to understand the potential for camelina to be grown as a biofuel crop in Scotland.
Beyond its potential as a renewable fuel source, camelina oil is also gaining popularity as a cooking oil.","Scientists from The James Hutton Institute and SRUC have produced a new report for the Scottish Government examining the potential for oilseed cover crops grown in Scotland to serve as feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel.

The evidence-based review, titled Oil-Based Cover Crops for Aviation Fuel in Scotland – Question and Answer Report, assesses the feasibility of cultivating oil-producing crops for biofuel production. The work follows a key recommendation from the recent Project Willow report — a joint UK and Scottish Government study exploring low-carbon industrial opportunities for Scotland’s Grangemouth site.

The report identifies camelina as the leading candidate crop. Already cultivated in several countries for aviation fuel production and in the UK for the health food market, camelina is considered a strong option due to the quality and suitability of its oil, according to a press release.

Next, researchers will launch field trials to study how camelina performs under Scottish growing conditions and how it might integrate into local crop rotations. The project will also assess potential environmental impacts — both positive and negative — to better understand camelina’s role in Scotland’s transition to sustainable agriculture and low-carbon fuel production.

“Camelina, particularly winter grown camelina, is a relatively novel crop for Scotland,” said Dr. Tracy Valentine, Project Lead and Senior Research Scientist. “By growing over winter, we hope to fit in with the main spring cropping season. Initially we will be looking at frost tolerance, growth rates, pests and fertiliser requirements, and ease of crop agronomy for farmers.

“This work will help to understand the potential for camelina to be grown as a biofuel crop in Scotland. Camelina is an oil seed plant, similar to oil seed rape and is part of the Brassicaceae (commonly known as mustard) plant family. It is widely grown across north America and Europe and is used for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production due to its high oil content and ultra-low carbon intensity compared to other alternative crops.”

One tonne of camelina seeds can yield roughly 200 to 230 litres of aviation fuel, though the exact output depends on the seed’s oil content, which typically ranges from 38% to 47%. For comparison, a light aircraft consumes an average of 22 to 45 litres of fuel per hour.

Beyond its potential as a renewable fuel source, camelina oil is also gaining popularity as a cooking oil. Naturally rich in vitamin E and omega fatty acids, it offers both nutritional benefits and a higher smoke point than many conventional oils, making it suitable for a range of culinary uses.

While this momentum enhances global access and mobility, it also drives up fuel consumption and significantly increases carbon emissions, intensifying environmental challenges. Without effective mitigation, aviation’s environmental footprint could undermine global climate objectives, underscoring the urgent need for industry-wide decarbonisation.

Among the various approaches to decarbonise aviation, the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is recognised as one of the most promising solutions. It is projected to contribute approximately 65 per cent of the total emissions reductions for the sector to achieve net-zero by 2050. SAF is a liquid fuel derived from renewable feedstocks such as agricultural residue and municipal waste. Although its hydrocarbon structure closely resembles that of conventional fossil fuel, resulting in similar tailpipe emissions, the key difference lies in its origin.

India holds a strategic edge in SAF production due to its abundant bio-based feedstocks, producing nearly 230 million tonnes of surplus biomass.",https://kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmgsites/in/images/2025/11/fuelling-a-cleaner-sky-indias-opportunity-in-sustainable-aviation-fuel.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 09:01:31.292508

With aviation responsible for nearly 2.5 per cent of global CO₂ emissions and passenger volumes continuing to rise, decarbonisation has become central to the sector’s long-term viability. Within this context, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as the most practical, immediate, and scalable solution. SAF not only delivers substantial lifecycle carbon reductions, but also integrates seamlessly into existing aircraft engines, fuel supply chains, and airport infrastructure, thus enabling transition without disruption.

For India, this transition represents both an imperative and an opportunity. It is one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world crossing ~239 million passengers in FY 2024-25, and on the path to become the third largest. Fleet expansions by leading carriers, supported by record aircraft orders exceeding 1,500, reflect confidence in India’s long-term economic fundamentals. Further, the firm order for widebody aircraft illustrates a new phase of ambition to connect to long-haul international markets. The progress achieved in India’s aviation sector is a direct outcome of deliberate policy foresight and sustained institutional commitment. This expansion has already pushed ATF consumption from 6.3 MMTPA in FY2015-16 to 8.98 MMTPA in FY2024-25, with volumes expected to more than double by 2040. Despite newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft, every capacity addition increases fuel demand, intensifying environmental pressures.

India faces rising fuel demand but also possesses the assets to lead - abundant feedstock, deep refining capacity, proven bioenergy experience, and a strong policy focus on energy transition. The resources, infrastructure, and policy intent are already in place. The real challenge and the strategic opportunity lies in orchestrating them into an integrated value chain that translates potential into measurable climate and competitiveness gains. The development of a domestic SAF industry can deliver multiple dividends: reduced crude import dependence, enhanced rural income, new technology value chains, and green job creation.

The transition to SAF is more than a technological shift, it is a test of strategic intent. India stands at the threshold of redefining its aviation sector not merely as a consumer of cleaner fuel, but as a producer, innovator, and global supplier of it. India’s airlines, airports, regulators, and innovators together represent a confident ecosystem ready to shape the next phase of green aviation. By aligning policy ambition with industrial execution, and pairing domestic feedstock strength with global collaboration, India can chart a flight path where economic growth and climate responsibility move in tandem. As India advances towards Viksit Bharat 2047, its leadership across the aviation value chain from connectivity to manufacturing, from sustainability to digital innovation will define it as a dominant and responsible player in global aviation.

In technical parlance, SAF refers to renewable or waste-derived aviation fuel that adheres to sustainability criteria.

“All industry players will be consulted before the policy is officially rolled out,” Naidu told businessline on the sidelines of an industry event here.

“Not just public sector refiners but also private ones will be consulted. Their participation in the SAF ecosystem is important if India is to emerge as a major exporter of SAF.”

businessline was the first to report that India is in the process of framing a comprehensive policy to promote both the production and utilisation of SAF.

In September 2025, Naidu emphasised that India holds a natural advantage in this segment in terms of geography, which allows it to become an exporter, and the massive availability of feedstock.

At present, India has over 750 million metric tonnes of available biomass and nearly 230 million metric tonnes of surplus agricultural residue.

Besides, India’s cost advantage in skilled labour and manufacturing will ensure that SAF is produced at a far more competitive rate compared to any other region in the world.

Nevertheless, one of the current challenges is price competitiveness.

Presently, industry estimates that the price of SAF is two to four times higher than that of traditional jet fuel.

Moreover, SAF plays a pivotal role in the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

This scheme is being implemented in three phases, with participation voluntary between 2021 and 2026.

India has chosen not to participate in the voluntary phases. However, offsetting requirements under CORSIA for Indian carriers will begin in 2027.

The scheme applies to international flights originating in one country and landing in another.

The Centre plans to implement the scheme with indicative targets of a one per cent SAF blend in ATF starting in 2027, increasing it to two per cent in 2028, and eventually reaching five per cent by 2030.

Recently, Indian Oil Corporation received certification to produce SAF at its Panipat refinery. This certification, a prerequisite for commercial SAF production, marks a significant step forward in India’s ability to produce, certify and distribute SAF at scale.

A new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) policy is imminent, aiming to boost farmers' incomes and create green jobs while reducing crude oil imports. India targets significant SAF blending by 2030, leveraging abundant biomass and agricultural residue. This initiative promises to balance aviation growth with sustainability goals.

The government will soon unveil a policy on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which could help reduce crude oil imports, boost farmers’ incomes, and generate more green jobs, reported PTI quoting Civil Aviation Minister K. Rammohan Naidu on Thursday.

Speaking at the India Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit 2025 in the national capital, Naidu said adopting SAF would require greater innovation, investment, and international collaboration.

“From feedstock to fuel, from farmers to flyers, and from frying to flying, who would have actually imagined that those frying samosas also can participate in this whole global aviation movement,” he said.

India aims for 1 per cent SAF blending in jet fuel by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028, and 5 per cent by 2030. The fuel can be used as a drop-in substitute in Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which powers aircraft.

The minister urged private players to participate in SAF production alongside oil companies. Globally, the demand for SAF is projected at 183 million tonnes by 2040.

Live Events

Highlighting India’s potential, Naidu said the country has over 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue.

The government plans to release its SAF policy shortly. Naidu noted that SAF could raise farmers’ incomes by 10-15 per cent, reduce crude oil import bills by USD 5-7 billion annually, and create more than 1 million green jobs along the SAF value chain.

“While global SAF production is currently very low, India can produce SAF at highly competitive rates, helping balance growth with sustainability,” he said.

India is among the world’s fastest-growing civil aviation markets, with domestic carriers having placed orders for over 1,700 planes.

Fluor Corporation, a prominent player in the engineering and construction industry, has been awarded the Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) contract for LanzaJet, Inc.’s Speedbird project, a commercial-scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) facility in Teesside, UK. This partnership aims to produce over 90,000 tons of SAF and renewable diesel annually, significantly contributing to carbon emissions reduction. The project is expected to cut British Airways' CO₂ emissions by approximately 230,000 tons per year, equivalent to the emissions of 26,000 domestic flights. This initiative aligns with Fluor's commitment to sustainable practices and positions the company at the forefront of the burgeoning market for alternative fuels.

The Speedbird project emphasizes the critical role of collaboration in advancing sustainable technologies. LanzaJet's CEO, Jimmy Samartzis, highlights the significance of this project in scaling their innovative approach to fuel production, utilizing patented Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology. Fluor's Group President, Mike Alexander, reiterates the importance of such projects in the global effort to decarbonize aviation. The partnership not only seeks to address climate change but also aims to create numerous jobs during the construction and operational phases, thereby contributing to local economic development in Northeast England. Additionally, the UK government has committed £10 million ($13 million) in funding from its Advanced Fuels Fund, underscoring the project’s potential impact.

Fluor's involvement in the Speedbird project signifies a strategic move toward sustainable engineering solutions in an era of increasing environmental awareness. By leading the engineering efforts for this innovative SAF facility, Fluor enhances its portfolio while supporting the aviation industry's transition to greener fuels. This project exemplifies the company's capability to integrate advanced technologies and sustainable practices, positioning Fluor as a leader in the evolving landscape of energy solutions.

In related news, Fluor faces scrutiny from multiple law firms conducting investigations into potential securities law violations following its disappointing financial disclosures. Allegations suggest that the company misrepresented its financial health concerning significant infrastructure projects, leading to a substantial drop in its stock price. These legal challenges highlight the complexities Fluor encounters as it navigates both the demands of current market conditions and its commitments to sustainable development.

Fluor's recent contract with LanzaJet represents a forward-thinking approach to energy production, while the legal investigations serve as a reminder of the intricate landscape within which the company operates. The outcome of these developments may significantly impact Fluor’s reputation and strategic direction as it balances sustainability initiatives with financial transparency.

The legal actions follow Fluor’s acknowledgment of increased costs and weaker customer spending, which put pressure on its Q2 2025 performance and future outlook.

Recent weeks have brought a flurry of headlines for Fluor, from securing a lead role in a major sustainable aviation fuel project in the UK to a wave of class action lawsuits following its lowered guidance and Q2 2025 missteps. Against this backdrop, Fluor’s share price has been volatile, with a recent dip and rebound culminating in a 1-year total shareholder return of -19%. While momentum clearly faded this year, its 3-year total return remains an impressive 48%, so the long-run trajectory is still positive for those who held through the turbulence.

If Fluor's ups and downs have you wondering what else is worth watching, this could be the perfect time to discover

The big question now, after a year of sharp swings and mixed signals, is whether Fluor is trading at a bargain due to short-term troubles or if the market has already taken the company’s growth prospects into account.

Most Popular Narrative: 5% Undervalued

According to the most widely tracked narrative, Fluor's fair value sits at $49.89, while the last close was $47.41. This suggests the shares are still trading below what analysts expect. Even after a turbulent year and recent guidance issues, this valuation hints that the market may be overlooking Fluor's resilience and future catalysts.

The analysts have a consensus price target of $49.889 for Fluor based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors. However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $57.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $40.0.

Want to know what bold projections are driving that upside? The heart of the narrative is a rapid shift in earnings, razor-thin future profit margins, and a price multiple typically reserved for market leaders. Curious what numbers underpin these optimistic assumptions? Click in to see why this fair value could be within reach.

Result: Fair Value of $49.89 (UNDERVALUED)

However, project delays and a decline in cash flow could quickly challenge the current outlook. These are key watchpoints for any narrative optimism.

Another View: SWS DCF Model Offers a Cautious Signal

While analysts see Fluor as undervalued based on earnings trajectories, our SWS DCF model offers a more reserved take. According to its calculations, Fluor is trading modestly above its fair value at this time. This suggests that recent market optimism may have already priced in the upside potential. Could alternative scenarios still play out?

- Premium Segment: U.S. private aviation represents a $17 billion market with 3+ million flights annually and burning 5.5 million gallons of fuel per day

- High Visibility: Private jet clients are early adopters of best-in-class, reputation-enhancing technologies

- Price Premium: Private aviation clients are less price-sensitive and willing to pay for verified, traceable SAF

- Scalable Model: Success in private aviation would validate XCF's direct-to-customer model for commercial expansion

The Numbers:

- 3 million+ private flights in U.S. in 2024 (40% of global private jet activity)

- ~2 billion gallons of jet fuel consumed annually by U.S. private aviation

- General aviation accounts for 8% of total U.S. jet fuel consumption (~5.5M gallons/day)

- A largely untapped market for SAF with significant growth potential

CEO Mihir Dange commented:

""Private aviation is an emerging frontier for SAF demand, a premium segment combining strong visibility with significant commercial potential. We're not just delivering cleaner fuel; we're transforming the experience of private flight into one of leadership in sustainability.""

#2: Deeply Oversold Technicals Signal Potential Reversal

Multiple technical indicators suggest SAFX may be approaching a near-term reversal from deeply oversold conditions:

- RSI (14): 20.18 (deep oversold territory, well below 30 threshold)

- Stochastic Oscillator: 8.78 (extreme oversold, well below 20)

- CCI (14): -104.67 (oversold signal, below -100)

- Technical Signals: 8 Buy signals, 7 Sell signals, 2 Neutral (per recent analysis)

What Is a Technical Reversal?

According to Investopedia: ""A reversal is a change in the price direction of an asset. Following a downtrend, a reversal would be to the upside. Reversals are based on overall price direction and are not typically based on one or two periods/bars on a chart.""

When multiple indicators simultaneously reach oversold extremes, it often signals that selling pressure may be exhausted and a technical bounce could be approaching. Combined with fundamental catalysts like the Impact Jets MOU and operational production milestones, this technical setup presents an interesting entry point for technical traders.

Note: Technical indicators should never be used in isolation. They are most valuable when combined with fundamental analysis and catalyst timing. Past technical patterns do not guarantee future performance.

#3: Riding The Massive SAF Market Wave (57.5% CAGR)

XCF Global is strategically positioned to capitalize on one of the fastest-growing markets in the entire energy sector. The SAF market's projected 57.5% compound annual growth rate through 2034 represents an extraordinary expansion trajectory driven by regulatory mandates, corporate commitments, and technological maturity.

Market Drivers Creating Structural Tailwinds:

- Regulatory Momentum: EU mandates requiring 2% SAF in 2025, escalating to 20% by 2035 and 70% by 2050

- UK Mandate: Progressive SAF blending requirements beginning 2025

- U.S. Grand Challenge: Government target of 3 billion gallons SAF production annually by 2030

- Corporate Commitments: Major airlines have committed to 10-35% SAF usage by 2030

- Investment Surge: Billions in capital flowing to SAF production infrastructure

- Technology Scaling: Production costs declining as scale and efficiency improve

The Supply-Demand Gap:

Current global SAF production of ~2 million tonnes in 2025 needs to scale to 15+ million tonnes by 2030 to meet demand projections. This 7.5x increase in just five years creates enormous opportunities for producers with operational capacity and a strong project pipeline like XCF. The company's modular, scalable facility design positions it to capture significant market share as the industry scales.

#4: Operational Production & Expanding Strategic Partnerships

Unlike many competitors still in development phases, XCF's New Rise Reno facility is in the ramp-up stage, optimizing production and producing renewable diesel at its New Rise Reno facility and preparing to return to SAF production as early as Q1 2026:

New Rise Reno Facility Status:

- Ramp-Up: Production of SAF and renewable diesel began in February 2025

- Deliveries: Commercial fuel deliveries began March 2025

- Investment: Over $350 million already invested in infrastructure

- Flexibility: Can produce SAF, renewable diesel, and renewable naphtha based on market conditions

- Technology: HEFA processing pathway produces ASTM certified fuel

- Employment: Created approximately 60 full-time jobs in the Reno-Tahoe area

Recent Strategic Developments (2025):

- Impact Jets Partnership (November) - Access to private aviation market via ~130 operators representing a fleet of ~1,400 aircraft

- Australian Licensing Agreement (October) - licensed New Rise Reno design, configuration, and layout to a partner in Australia with a target to build 3 SAF facilities in the country

- FlyORO Partnership (October) - Collaborative marketing initiatives

- Posh Energy Partnership (September) - Converting byproducts to zero-carbon electricity &#8211; potential to add the 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit to its credit stack and boost the value of its 45Z and LCFS credits

- Nasdaq Opening Bell (August) - Celebrated public listing at Times Square MarketSite

- OpenSponsorship Partnership (August) - Partners with OpenSponsorship to drive awareness for carbon-neutral air travel in sports and entertainment

Expansion Pipeline:

XCF has announced plans for three additional U.S. sites including a second production facility next to the existing New Rise Reno facility which would double capacity and expand market reach, plus international expansion through licensing partnerships in Australia and potentially other markets. The company's strategic plan includes an investment of ~$300 million; expected to begin construction of New Rise Reno 2 in 2026 . This multi-facility strategy provides geographic diversification and significant scalability.

#5: Government Mandates & Tax Credits Creating Structural Demand

Perhaps the most powerful catalyst: regulatory and financial support creating guaranteed demand for SAF producers like XCF.

U.S. Government Support:

- Sustainable Aviation Fuel Tax Credit: Federal tax credits for SAF production

- Inflation Reduction Act: Enhanced tax credits for clean fuel production

- SAF Grand Challenge: USDA/DOE/DOT initiative targeting 3B gallons/year by 2030

- Bipartisan Support: SAF development enjoys rare political consensus

International Mandates:

- EU ReFuelEU Aviation: Mandatory blending starting 2% (2025), rising to 70% (2050)

- UK Mandate: Progressive SAF requirements beginning 2025

- ICAO CORSIA: International carbon offsetting scheme creating SAF demand

What This Means for XCF:

These mandates don't just create demand; they create GUARANTEED demand that airlines must fulfill regardless of price premiums. As one of the few U.S.-based producers, XCF is strategically positioned to capture significant value from both regulatory requirements and government incentives that improve production economics. The combination of mandated blending requirements and favorable tax treatment creates a structural tailwind that should support industry growth through 2050.

Investment Considerations & Risk Factors

Investment Opportunities:

- Early-mover operational advantage in rapidly scaling SAF market

- Multiple near-term catalysts including partnership formalization and production milestones

- 57.5% market CAGR creates rising tide for established producers

- Government support creating structural tailwinds through 2050

- Strategic positioning in high-visibility premium market segments

Material Risk Factors:

- Early-stage company with recent public listing and evolving business model

- SAF currently costs 3-5x conventional jet fuel, requiring subsidies for economic viability

- Feedstock constraints may limit HEFA pathway scaling in the future

- Production ramp risks and operational challenges at New Rise Reno facility

- Competition from well-capitalized incumbents (Neste, TotalEnergies (NYSE:$TTE), Phillips 66 (NYSE:$PSX))

- Recent Nasdaq listing compliance issues (resolved as of October 2025)

- Company has faced challenges with timely SEC filing requirements

- Ongoing landlord and lender disputes related to New Rise Reno facility

- Regulatory and policy uncertainties, particularly regarding tax credit continuity

- High volatility and speculative nature of small-cap clean energy stocks

The Bottom Line

XCF Global represents a high-risk, high-potential opportunity at the intersection of multiple powerful trends: aviation decarbonization, government-mandated SAF adoption, private jet sustainability consciousness, and explosive market growth.

With renewable diesel production underway and the return to SAF production as early as Q1 2026, strategic partnerships expanding into premium markets, deeply oversold technical indicators, and government mandates creating structural demand, SAFX presents an asymmetric risk/reward profile for investors willing to accept the inherent volatility and execution risks of an early-stage SAF producer.

The combination of:

- A massive TAM growing at 57.5% annually

- Operational production advantage vs. competitors

- Strategic positioning in high-value market segments

- Government support creating guaranteed demand

- Multiple near-term catalysts on the horizon

This suggests SAFX merits serious consideration for speculative clean energy portfolios with appropriate position sizing relative to individual risk tolerance and investment objectives.

Key Monitoring Points:

- Additional strategic partnership and offtake agreement announcements

- Formalization of Impact Jets partnership into definitive agreement

- First revenue announcements from ""Powered by XCF SAF"" program

- Production volume updates and ramp progress from New Rise Reno facility

- Quarterly financial results and operational metrics disclosures

- Resolution of landlord and lender disputes

- Progress on additional U.S. production facility development

Malaysia Airlines partners with FatHopes Energy for SAF production from used cooking oil, contributing to net-zero aviation by 2050. Garuda Indonesia aligns with Indonesia’s SAF regulations, while Thai Airways adopts national SAF standards. Philippine Airlines, targeting net-zero by 2050, explores SAF use by 2030. Government blueprints and amendments across the region shape these policies, driving fleet modernization, SAF use, and carbon reduction goals. These regulations are part of a broader regional effort to reduce aviation emissions, with governments implementing market-based measures to foster green aviation.

Singapore Airlines (SIA) – Singapore

Government requirements

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate and SAF levy – Singapore’s Ministry of Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) require all flights departing Singapore to use SAF starting in 2026 with a 1 % SAF target, increasing to 3–5 % by 2030[1]. To implement the SAF mandate, the CAAS (Amendment) Bill (Sept 2025) authorises CAAS to collect a SAF levy and centralise procurement; the levy will provide cost certainty and fund a centralised SAF fund[2]. The bill emphasises that a centralised procurement approach will aggregate demand and secure better commercial terms for airlines[3].

Establishment of SAFCo – In Oct 2025, CAAS announced the creation of Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd (SAFCo) to procure SAF and manage the SAF levy. SAFCo will aggregate voluntary demand, contract with suppliers and help achieve the 1 % SAF target in 2026 and 3–5 % by 2030[4]. The company will support the development of a scalable SAF ecosystem[5].

Operational and airport initiatives – Singapore’s 2024 Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint commits to improving air‑traffic management, deploying energy‑efficient operations at Changi Airport, expanding solar power and electrifying all new airside vehicles by 2025 to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050[1].

Impact on Singapore Airlines’ policies

Commitment to net‑zero and fleet modernisation – The SIA Group aims to be net‑zero by 2050. It has a young fleet (average age about 7 years) consisting of fuel‑efficient Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 aircraft, with upcoming Boeing 777‑9 and A350F freighters. The fleet modernisation is aligned with the government’s decarbonisation blueprint[6].

SAF procurement and initiatives – SIA trialled sustainable fuel with CAAS and GenZero, purchasing 1 000 tonnes of neat SAF that reduced ~2 500 tonnes of CO₂. The trial showed voluntary demand alone is insufficient, leading to the mandated SAF requirement[7]. SIA’s FY2024/25 sustainability report states the group purchased 2 000 tonnes of neat SAF and signed an MoU with Aether Fuels to explore SAF derived from carbon feedstock; SIA also joined the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines pledge to replace 5 % of fuel consumption with SAF by 2030[8][9]. As SAF is integrated via SAFCo, SIA will need to plan its fuel procurement and pricing under the government’s levy system.

Operational efficiency and air‑traffic management – The blueprint’s Long Range Air Traffic Flow Management trial with SIA aims to reduce holding times and unnecessary fuel burn, with implementation planned for 2026[10]. SIA also implements weight‑reduction measures and optimised flight plans to save fuel[6].

Garuda Indonesia – Indonesia

Government initiatives

Decarbonisation commitment – Indonesia’s Ministry of Transportation (Directorate General of Air Transportation) commits to reducing greenhouse‑gas emissions from aviation to support the Paris Agreement and the country’s 2060 net‑zero goal. A July 2025 Antara News report (state‑run) states that the ministry’s programme includes monitoring emissions, encouraging SAF implementation, carbon offsetting under CORSIA, improving energy efficiency of airport operations and flights, and ensuring transparent emission reporting[11].

Accelerating SAF regulations – An October 2025 Antara article quotes the ministry’s Director of Airworthiness and Aircraft Operations, Sokhib Al Rokhman, saying that Indonesia is strengthening the SAF roadmap, developing monitoring‑reporting mechanisms and implementing CORSIA standards. With proper certification and incentives, the ministry expects domestic SAF adoption to reduce emissions without disrupting operations[12].

Implications for Garuda Indonesia

SAF adoption and compliance – As the national flag carrier, Garuda Indonesia will need to comply with the Ministry of Transportation’s SAF roadmap and the CORSIA reporting requirements. The government’s focus on MRV (monitoring, reporting and verification) and certification suggests that airlines will be required to adopt SAF blends and report emissions, which will shape Garuda’s fuel procurement and fleet‑planning strategies.

Operational efficiency – Improvements in energy efficiency at airports and flights, as outlined by the ministry, may require Garuda to invest in newer aircraft, upgrade air‑traffic management procedures, and participate in carbon‑offset programmes. Garuda is also expected to participate in stakeholder collaborations to align operations with national decarbonisation targets.

Thai Airways – Thailand

Government direction

Support for SAF and multi‑sector cooperation – A July 2025 article from the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) (official website) reports on the SEA SAF Forum 2025. CAAT director Air Chief Marshal Manat Chuanpraphrue participated in a session on the “Role of SAF in Aviation Transport Decarbonization.” The article highlights Thailand’s commitment to promoting the development and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel to reduce greenhouse‑gas emissions and emphasises that cooperation between government, private sector and academia is needed to drive a concrete transition[13].

Regional SAF roadmap – According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Thai Ministry of Energy aimed to finalise guidelines for SAF use by the end of 2024 and there are planned SAF production facilities (e.g., Bangchak’s Phra Khanong plant) expected to start producing SAF in 2025[14]. Although this is an intergovernmental report, it shows that Thai authorities recognise SAF as key to decarbonising aviation.

Impact on Thai Airways

Policy alignment – Thai Airways, as the national flag carrier, is expected to align with Thailand’s emerging SAF guidelines and collaborate with CAAT and energy agencies. Participation in forums indicates the government’s expectation that the airline will adopt SAF when domestic production becomes available.

Fleet and route optimisation – Thailand’s policy environment encourages airlines to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions through fleet renewal and optimised operations. Thai Airways will need to incorporate these requirements into its post‑pandemic restructuring, which includes modernising its fleet and exploring partnerships for SAF supply as domestic production scales up.

Malaysia Airlines – Malaysia

Government policies

Malaysia Aviation Decarbonisation Blueprint (MADB) – Launched in 2024, the MADB aims for net‑zero aviation emissions by 2050. The Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia’s Waypoint document explains that the blueprint sets four strategies: reducing emissions via aircraft technology (18 % contribution), operational improvements (5 %), adoption of SAF (46 %), and market‑based measures such as carbon offsetting (31 %)[15]. The plan calls for integrating SAF into the fuel supply chain, investing in airport infrastructure for next‑generation fuels, electrifying ground vehicles, improving energy efficiency and waste management, and updating environmental management plans[16].

Investment in SAF production – The same document notes that Petronas and partners are building a biorefinery in Johor to produce SAF and other biofuels by 2028[17], indicating a national commitment to local SAF production.

Policy coordination – Implementation involves cross‑ministerial cooperation: the Ministry of Plantation and Commodities will lead the national SAF blending mandate, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability will develop a national carbon‑market policy, and the Ministry of Transport chairs a steering committee to monitor progress[16].

Influence on Malaysia Airlines’ policies

Net‑zero commitment and SAF partnerships – Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG), parent of Malaysia Airlines, supports the MADB. In February 2025, MAG signed an MoU with FatHopes Energy to explore using used cooking oil (UCO) as feedstock for SAF. The partnership aims to collect UCO sustainably and convert it to neat SAF, assess scalability and economic feasibility, and build a local SAF ecosystem, supporting Malaysia’s net‑zero aviation ambitions[18]. This initiative positions Malaysia Airlines to integrate domestic SAF into its operations once production is available.

Passenger engagement and carbon fees – The Waypoint document mentions that Malaysia Airlines offers passengers the option to contribute to carbon‑offset and SAF initiatives, while low‑cost carrier AirAsia may impose a mandatory carbon fee to fund SAF and other sustainability programs[19]. Such mechanisms reflect how environmental policies influence fare structures and customer engagement.

Fleet efficiency and ground operations – The MADB’s call for operational improvements implies that Malaysia Airlines will continue to modernise its fleet and implement fuel‑efficiency programs. Electrification of ground vehicles and energy‑efficient airport operations may require investments in infrastructure at its hubs.

Philippine Airlines – Philippines

Government efforts

Commitment to SAF production – In February 2025, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) announced plans to partner with Boeing to produce and use Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The department said the Philippines has sufficient agricultural waste feedstock to meet its jet‑fuel needs and possibly export SAF. It emphasised that SAF could reduce aviation emissions by up to 80 % and that innovation and partnerships would create jobs and make the Philippines a leader in SAF production[20].

Global aviation engagement – The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) noted in December 2023 that Philippine delegations to ICAO’s Third Conference on Aviation Alternative Fuels aimed to support sustainable aviation fuel development and that sustainability would be a key theme at the 59th DGCA conference, which the Philippines planned to host in 2024[21].

State‑run news agency reports – A 2023 Philippine News Agency article reported that Philippine Airlines (PAL) aims to achieve net‑zero carbon emissions by 2050. PAL has a holistic carbon‑reduction programme covering flight and ground operations, uses renewable energy in its offices, is exploring SAF, and applies fuel‑efficiency measures such as single‑engine taxiing[22]. Another PNA report from November 2023 quotes a PAL spokesperson stating that the airline is exploring SAF with the aim of using it by 2030; the airline is working with stakeholders to make SAF more affordable and available[23].

Effects on Philippine Airlines’ policies

Net‑zero target and carbon‑reduction programme – PAL’s net‑zero commitment aligns with DOTr’s ambition to make the Philippines a leader in SAF production. PAL has begun renewable energy use in its offices and adopted fuel‑efficiency initiatives (single‑engine taxiing, reduced acceleration altitude)[22].

SAF exploration and timelines – PAL’s plan to start using SAF by 2030 supports the government’s strategy to develop local SAF production. The DOTr–Boeing partnership indicates that feedstock availability and private‑public collaboration will help accelerate SAF use[20].

International collaboration – Participation in ICAO’s alternative‑fuels conferences and the DGCA meeting underscores the Philippines’ commitment to aligning its policies with global decarbonisation goals. PAL will need to comply with future SAF mandates and carbon‑offset schemes resulting from these engagements.

Conclusion

In 2024‑2025, Southeast Asian governments intensified efforts to decarbonise aviation. Singapore legislated a SAF mandate and levy, established a central procurement company, and required improvements in air‑traffic management and airport operations. Indonesia’s transportation ministry accelerated SAF regulations and emphasised CORSIA compliance. Thailand promoted SAF adoption through regulatory guidance and multi‑sector cooperation, while Malaysia launched a comprehensive decarbonisation blueprint prioritising SAF and invested in domestic bio‑refineries. The Philippines pursued SAF partnerships and planned to harness agricultural waste for fuel, while emphasising net‑zero targets and international collaboration.

These policies directly influence airline strategies. Singapore Airlines must procure SAF through the new levy and centralised system, invest in fleet modernisation and participate in operational efficiency trials. Garuda Indonesia will need to comply with SAF roadmaps and reporting requirements. Thai Airways must prepare for SAF adoption and optimize operations as national guidelines solidify. Malaysia Airlines is exploring used‑cooking‑oil‑based SAF and offering passengers carbon‑offset options, aligning with the government’s blueprint. Philippine Airlines pursues a net‑zero target by 2050, exploring SAF with a 2030 timeline and engaging in government‑led partnerships. Together, these actions illustrate how environmental impact and carbon‑emission concerns are reshaping airline policies across Southeast Asia.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-10-31-085959-3.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 03:17:10.107863

This means sustainability is becoming not just an environmental imperative but also a competitive one.","With limited access to affordable sustainable aviation fuel, DANX Group is reengineering supply chains using new technologies like cargo drones, electric ground power units, and HVO-fuelled equipment to cut emissions while maintaining efficiency.

Scaling green logistics solutions requires active government intervention, fair regulation, and investment in renewable fuel and electricity production to ensure environmental progress remains financially viable.

Data-driven emissions tracking, stronger collaboration across the supply chain, and customer demand for verified sustainability credentials are making decarbonisation a strategic advantage rather than a compliance exercise.

The industry has long been seen as one of the more difficult sectors to decarbonise, caught between the urgency of global supply chains and the need to cut emissions. With sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in short supply and often prohibitively expensive, stakeholders are rethinking how to keep critical shipments moving while reducing environmental impact.

In the face of limited access to affordable SAF, players are searching for solutions that don’t just wait for greener fuels to arrive. “In the absence of a consistent and affordable supply of sustainable aviation fuel, we believe the industry needs to reengineer supply chains through new technologies and alternative flight capabilities for the distribution of urgent and critical shipments,” said Val Karren, Director of Sustainability at DANX Group.

One example is the use of drones as a supplement to the traditional hub-and-spoke flight pattern. For time-sensitive shipments, this model promises not only efficiency but also a measurable reduction in carbon emissions. “Drones capable of carrying 300–350 kilograms can extend service beyond the immediate hub areas while lowering the intensity ratio of kgCO₂e per tonne-kilometre,” Karren explained.

Creative initiatives beyond carbon reduction

Sustainability is not only about flight operations. On the ground, new approaches are reducing the industry’s reliance on fossil fuels and minimising waste. “We have already replaced ground power units with electric versions, which provide aircraft power during loading, unloading, and start-up without the need for hours of diesel engine use,” said Karren.

Where diesel equipment is still necessary, alternatives are emerging. “HVO is already being used as a replacement fuel to limit CO₂ emissions from fork lift trucks and belt loaders,” he noted. Recycling efforts also play a part: “Full recycling of handling materials, from wood to plastic wraps, provides a small financial return from waste companies.”

Scaling green technologies

Even the most innovative technologies face a fundamental challenge: scaling. “Scaling these solutions will only be possible with continued government intervention,” Karren emphasised. He argued that mandates around SAF adoption must be “backed by fair regulation of how suppliers pass on costs to customers,” otherwise compliance risks becoming “prohibitively expensive for end users.”

The same applies to other alternatives such as HVO and renewable electricity. “We need governments and policymakers to actively stimulate production and storage capacity,” Karren said. Without it, he warned, “scaling will remain slow.”

Speed, cost, and environmental responsibility

For an industry built on speed, sustainability introduces inevitable trade-offs. Electric vehicles, for example, are promising but bring their own challenges. “Their limited battery capacity introduces both logistical and cost challenges,” said Karren. “Careful evaluation of which routes are suitable for EVs is important as the charging infrastructure has to be in place, and charging times can cause delays if not properly planned.”

Costs are another hurdle. “Having to dispatch two EVs to deliver what one diesel powered van or truck could deliver of course creates costs that are hard to carry without direct customer contribution,” he explained. Yet there are encouraging signs. “HVO in a few of our most important markets is at parity—or very close to—with diesel. As we see supply and availability of HVO grow, this provides a great savings of CO₂ emissions vs. diesel without causing pressure on financial margins.”

Measuring, collaborating, and looking ahead

Data is becoming the foundation for sustainability strategies. “Accurate measurement of Scope 3 emissions in a shared logistics network is simply too complex to be managed with traditional tools like spreadsheets,” said Karren. Instead, digital tools are enabling more precise allocation of emissions to customers and helping to build “reduction strategies that align with service level agreements instead of undermining them.”

Collaboration is equally vital. Karren pointed to challenges such as “shared costs, uncoordinated timelines and goals, and a lack of enforcement of industry best practices.” Without stronger alignment between airlines, forwarders, and ground handlers, progress risks being piecemeal.

Yet customer expectations are already driving change. This means sustainability is becoming not just an environmental imperative but also a competitive one. “OEM shippers are increasingly demanding demonstrable ‘green credentials’ from their logistics partners before allowing them to even participate in RFQs,” Karren said.

Looking ahead, he sees major opportunities in next-generation solutions. “One of the most exciting possibilities is the rise of autonomous cargo drones capable of transporting hundreds of kilograms over thousands of kilometres using biofuels or renewable electricity,” Karren concluded.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Page-20-Val-Kerran-1080x720.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 20:00:17.543759

Specific measures included in the plan are expected to mobilize at least EUR 2.9 billion ($3.33 billion) by the end of 2027. This includes at least EUR 2 billion mobilized by InvestEU for sustainable alternative fuels as part of an effort to rapidly remove key investment barriers and bridge the financial gap in the short term.

The European Commission also said it will propose EUR 300 million by the end of 2025 to support the production of hydrogen for use in SAF and sustainable maritime fuel (SMF) through the European Hydrogen Bank. The commission will also support research and innovation projects with approximately EUR 133 million under Horizon Europe and mobilize EUR 153 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects and EUR 293 million for maritime fuel projects under the Innovation Fund.

In addition, the European Commission said it will launch an eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project before the end of the year with the aim to mobilize at least EUR 500 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects.

The STIP will also strengthen international partnerships to boost global production of these fuels, while at the same time protecting EU investments and ensuring fair competition for EU fuel producers and users.

The European Commission estimates that approximately 12.2 million metric tons of biofuels and 6.8 million metric tons e-fuels will be needed to meet fuel targets established by the ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime regulations. The market will need to invest an estimated EUR 100 billion by 2035 to drive this volume of production.

Ways and Means Committee Democrats Introduce Bill to Restore Clean Energy Credits after OBBBA: Last week, House Ways and Means Democrats introduced H.R.5862, “American Energy Independence and Affordability Act.” The bill seeks to restore a wide array of clean energy tax incentives that were rolled back by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA, P.L.119-21). Key measures include reinstating the Section 45Y clean electricity production credit and the Section 48E clean electricity investment credit for renewables like wind and solar, extending the timeline for claiming the Section 45V clean hydrogen, Section 25D residential clean energy and the electric vehicle and recharging property credits. The bill also renews special rates for sustainable aviation fuel under Section 45Z and removes the eligibility of coal for the Section 45X advanced manufacturing production credits.

Curtis and Cantwell Introduce Bill to Extend Section 45X to Fusion: Last week, Sens. John Curtis (R-UT) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) introduced the “Fusion Advanced Manufacturing Parity Act,” which would extend the advanced manufacturing production credit (Section 45X) to fusion energy technologies. The bill provides a 25% production tax credit for a wide range of domestically manufactured fusion components like superconducting magnets, plasma vacuum vessels and fusion heating systems. It also expands the federal critical minerals list to include key materials like deuterium, tritium and helium-3. In the House, Rep. Carol Miller (R-WV) leads the companion bill with Reps.

Schumer, Wyden and Warren Send Letters Regarding IRS CEO Position: On Oct. 28, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Senate Finance Committee (SFC) Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) sent letters to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Social Security Administrator Frank Bisignano regarding the new chief executive officer position at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In the letter to Commissioner Bisignano, the senators expressed concerns regarding the legality of his dual role as Social Security Administration (SSA) commissioner and the newly created chief executive officer (CEO) of the IRS. They questioned the statutory authority for the IRS CEO position, noting that it bypasses Senate confirmation and raised doubts about his capacity to manage two large federal agencies effectively, especially as they are headquartered in different cities amid significant workforce reductions and operational challenges.

In the letter to Secretary Bessent, the senators raised legal and operational concerns about the appointment of Commissioner Bisignano as “Chief Executive Officer” of the IRS. They argue that this dual role conflicts with Bisignano’s existing duties at the SSA and undermines the need for a full-time, Senate-confirmed IRS commissioner, especially ahead of the 2026 filing season. They questioned the legal basis for delegating IRS commissioner duties to Commissioner Bisignano, the compliance of this arrangement with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, potential conflicts of interest given ongoing SSA-IRS litigation and requested detailed explanations of the delegation of authority and oversight mechanisms.

Taxpayers Revive IRS Dispute Resolution Program: Last year, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) expanded its alternative dispute resolution (ADR) resources to encourage taxpayers to resolve disputes before litigation. Recently, the programs saw a 25% increase in usage by companies and individuals in fiscal year (FY) 2024 and is maintaining that upturn in FY2025. In early October, the IRS announced modifications to its post-appeals mediation (PAM) program, now assigning unresolved cases to Office of Appeals teams with no prior involvement in the case for an expedited, unbiased review. Earlier this year, the IRS relaxed eligibility rules for its Fast Track Settlement program, allowing cases with some ineligible issues still to participate and enabling more taxpayers, especially small businesses/self-employed, to join after points at which such cases have traditionally been excluded from the program, for example, the issuance of a 30-day letter or filing a protest with the Office of Appeals.

ERC Claim Processing Impacted by Government Shutdown: The shutdown is worsening existing difficulties that taxpayers face in claiming the Employee Retention Credit (ERC) for businesses. Thousands of ERC claims remain unprocessed due to a significant IRS backlog that existed even before the shutdown. The shutdown has forced the IRS to reduce staff by roughly half, paused appeals conferences and shuttered the Taxpayer Advocate Service, which normally assists with administrative issues, leaving taxpayers with fewer resources to resolve problems. Meanwhile, a two-year statutory deadline for filing refund suits looms and delayed appeals scheduling risks causing taxpayers to miss critical deadlines.

EU Countries Raise Concerns Over U.S. Global Tax Deal: Last week, the United States reportedly moved closer to a deal on coexistence with the OECD’s Pillar Two framework. Some EU countries, including Hungary and Estonia, have voiced skepticism, expressing concern that the United States might undercut Europe’s tax regime. Although the framework is intended to curb harmful tax practices and ensure multinational corporations pay a sufficient amount of tax, negotiations over U.S. exemptions risk weakening international support. OECD officials remain hopeful that a “side-by-side system” could preserve U.S. participation, but the path to a final agreement remains uncertain.

French DST Proposal Draws More Backlash from Congress: Last week, French lawmakers approved an amendment to increase the digital services tax on American technology companies from 3% to 6%. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, criticized the measure and warned that the United States must respond with consequences, arguing that the tax disproportionately targets U.S. digital platforms. The move signals a potential escalation in trade tensions between the two nations, especially as the EU continues to finalize a broad-based trade agreement with the United States.

Asia Trade Deals Include DST Concessions: Last week, the Trump administration signed new trade agreements and frameworks with several Asian countries, including Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand.

The French National Assembly has overwhelmingly rejected a provision in the 2026 finance bill that aimed to reduce the tax advantages of E85 ethanol and B100 biodiesel. The proposal sought to eliminate the preferential tax rate on B100, which is primarily used by transporters, and gradually reduce the tax advantage for E85 compared to conventional fuels.

The amendment put forward by Richard Ramos, a deputy from the MoDem party, was approved by 147 votes to 43, after receiving broad support from lawmakers across different political parties. Opponents of the measure included left-wing MPs, as well as those from right-wing and centrist parties. The opposition was primarily driven by concerns over the negative impact on the French agricultural sector, which supplies the raw materials used in these fuels.

A Unified Political Front Against the Reform

The agricultural sector’s mobilization played a key role in the rejection of the measure. The National Federation of Farmers’ Unions (FNSEA), which represents beet and rapeseed producers, strongly opposed the reform, highlighting the negative effects it would have on outlets for farmers’ produce. E85 and B100 biofuels represent crucial markets for agricultural raw materials, with approximately 1% of France’s usable agricultural land currently allocated to these crops.

Deputy Daniel Labaronne (Renaissance) emphasized the need to maintain these tax advantages to “preserve French industries” and avoid greater reliance on imported fossil fuels. He noted that nearly 120,000 French farmers are engaged in producing these biofuels.

Disagreements Over the Definition of Biofuels

The ecologist group, which voted against the amendment for its repeal, questioned the very definition of “biofuel” for products such as E85 and B100. Deputy Benoît Biteau, representing the ecologists, criticized the use of fossil fuel-based fertilizers in the production of these biofuel raw materials. He argued that these agrofuels do not meet ecological criteria and are far from being sustainable alternatives.

On the majority side, Public Accounts Minister Amélie de Montchalin had supported an interim solution that would have phased in the tax increase on B100 over two years, without revisiting the increase on E85. However, this amendment could not be debated before the repeal amendments, due to the order in which votes were held.

La France Insoumise abstained from voting, while the RN group defended the argument that the tax increase would have unfairly penalized motorists using these alternative fuels.

Recently, I was reviewing carbon data with a client who was considering switching to enhanced CO₂e reporting. When we compared two different data sets, there was an “ah-ha” moment. The numbers showed that this company – a business with a high volume of corporate and events-related travel – had been over-investing in carbon offsetting. The travel manager realised that the savings from more accurate reporting would more than pay for the enhanced service. A simple example, but it demonstrates how better data doesn’t just improve credibility, it makes financial sense too.

Seeing is believing. When we see data presented in graphs or tables, it becomes tangible. There’s a source, a structure, something we can trust. In contrast, words are easy to say but they’re not always validated. That’s why, in sustainability, the story only matters if the numbers back it up.

“When we see data presented in graphs or tables, it becomes tangible”

Yet when companies suddenly find themselves under pressure to demonstrate sustainability action, the instinct is often to act fast rather than act accurately. Without robust data, knee-jerk decisions can lead to unintended consequences, such as cutting travel altogether. That might reduce emissions, but at what cost to sales, relationships, or growth? Good data gives you options. It can highlight opportunities to switch suppliers, move shorter flights to rail, or combine trips more efficiently, all while keeping the business moving.

Enhanced carbon reporting is still relatively new. For years, most organisations relied on standard DEFRA calculations. Now, as businesses demand more detailed insight, reporting tools are becoming more dynamic and accurate. The shift is clear: investing in good data upfront delivers benefits that far outweigh the cost financially, operationally, and reputationally.

There’s little point investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel, carbon offsets, or removal projects if you can’t explain what those actions equate to. Let the numbers tell the story. Use data to show progress against carbon neutrality or net zero goals, and to highlight where attention is still needed. This year’s reductions or offsets only count for this year. Next year, the process begins again. Budgeting based on real data ensures that businesses are investing the right amount in the right places.

“When we compared two different data sets, there was an ‘ah-ha’ moment”

For travel and event managers, this is where sustainability becomes real. Numbers speak for themselves. If aviation emissions have dropped, the data will prove it. If the goal was to shift 20% of air travel to rail, the evidence is right there. Tracking progress throughout the year allows teams to adapt, refine and demonstrate impact, not just intention.

Good data doesn’t just measure progress. It drives it. And it won’t cost the earth (excuse the pun!).",https://thebusinesstravelmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tbtm-3-1024x614.png,N,,2025-11-05 16:16:35.528217

Converting Waste into Drop-In Renewable Fuels

Honeywell has launched a new technology that turns agricultural and forestry waste into ready-to-use renewable fuels for carbon-intensive sectors, including shipping and aviation. The Biocrude Upgrading process produces low-carbon marine fuel, gasoline, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from widely available biomass such as wood chips and crop residues.

The innovation targets one of the most stubborn challenges in global decarbonisation: replacing heavy fuel oil in the maritime industry. These “drop-in” renewable fuels can be used directly in existing engines without costly retrofits, while offering a higher energy density than many biofuel alternatives—extending vessel range and operational efficiency.

Ken West, president of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, said the company’s technology aligns with growing demand for scalable, cost-effective alternatives. “The maritime industry has a real need for renewable fuels that are immediately available and cost effective. Our Biocrude Upgrading processing technology can be delivered in modular form, offering savings from installation through to refining and use,” West said.

Decentralized Production, Central Refining

The Biocrude Upgrading process begins with converting biomass waste into a biocrude at collection sites, minimising transportation emissions and costs. The resulting feedstock is then refined at larger industrial facilities to produce fuels with performance comparable to conventional options.

By allowing biocrude conversion closer to the source and refining at scale, Honeywell’s model addresses one of the key logistical barriers to biomass-based fuels—costly feedstock transport and low energy yield.

The modular design further accelerates deployment by reducing construction timelines. Prefabricated plants can be installed faster than traditional facilities, offering a route to commercial-scale renewable fuel production with lower upfront risk.

Maritime Decarbonization Pressures Mount

The technology arrives as the global shipping industry faces intensifying regulatory and market pressure to curb emissions. Since the 1960s, heavy fuel oil—derived from the residues of gasoline and diesel refining—has powered most of the world’s merchant fleet, contributing roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Decarbonizing shipping remains a major technical and financial challenge. Alternative fuels like green methanol and ammonia are advancing but face infrastructure, storage, and safety constraints. Honeywell’s renewable marine fuel option could serve as a near-term transition pathway, leveraging existing port and vessel systems while reducing lifecycle emissions.

Over the past decade, the company has developed multiple pathways, including Ecofining™ for hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) fuels, Ethanol to Jet (ETJ) for alcohol-based SAF production, Fischer-Tropsch Unicracking™ for advanced syngas conversion, and UOP eFining™—a system that turns green hydrogen and captured CO₂ into e-fuels.

Together, these systems reflect Honeywell’s integrated approach to low-carbon fuel production, spanning feedstock flexibility, process efficiency, and carbon intensity reduction.

Implications for Investors and Policymakers

For investors and policymakers, Honeywell’s move highlights the accelerating convergence between industrial innovation and climate policy. As regulators tighten emissions standards and corporate customers demand cleaner logistics, scalable waste-to-fuel technologies are gaining strategic importance.

Beyond maritime transport, the modular biocrude model could influence how future SAF and renewable gasoline supply chains are structured—shifting production closer to agricultural hubs and aligning with circular economy principles.

With shipping responsible for nearly a billion tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually, solutions that blend compatibility, scalability, and affordability are likely to shape the next phase of energy transition in transport. Honeywell’s latest technology positions it squarely within that shift—where waste becomes feedstock, and decarbonisation becomes practical.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Honeywell-Launches-Biomass-Conversion-Technology-to-Produce-Renewable-Marine-and-Aviation-Fuels.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 17:16:31.747408

Competitiveness and sustainability are the guiding principles of this package, which aims to make the EU transport system more efficient, interconnected, accessible, clean and resilient, according to the commission.

The measures presented Nov. 4 cover two key areas—rail, where Europe already leads on sustainability, and fuels, where Europe must now accelerate investments for its energy transition.

Faster, more connected rail across Europe

The new High-Speed Rail Action Plan sets out the steps needed to create a faster, more interoperable and better-connected European network by 2040.

It aims to cut journey times and make rail a more attractive alternative to short-haul air travel, thus increasing passenger numbers and boosting regional economies and tourism.

Building on the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), the plan foresees to connect major nodes at speeds of 200 kilometers (124 miles) per hour and above.

Passengers will be able to travel from Berlin, Germany, to Copenhagen, Denmark, in four hours instead of the current seven, and from Sofia, Bulgaria, to Athens, Greece, in six hours instead of the current 13 hours and 40 minutes.

New cross-border links will also enable faster and simpler journeys such as Paris–Lisbon via Madrid and improved connectivity between the Baltic capitals.

To deliver this vision, the commission proposes four key strands of action:

Removing cross-border bottlenecks through binding timelines to be set by 2027 and the identification of options for higher speeds, including well-above 250 kilometers (155 miles) per hour when economically viable.

Developing a coordinated financing strategy, including a strategic dialogue with member states, industry and financiers leading to a high-speed rail deal to mobilize the required investment.

Improving the conditions for the rail industry and rail operators to invest, develop innovative solutions and operate competitively, including through a more attractive regulatory environment, by enhancing cross-border ticketing and booking systems, supporting a second-hand market for rolling stock, accelerating the deployment of the EU digital-management systems, and fostering R&D and cooperation on scalable solutions.

Strengthening EU-level governance, requiring infrastructure managers to coordinate on capacity for cross-border long-distance services, and facilitating standardizations and authorizations.

Beyond shorter travel times, the plan will ease congestion and free up capacity on conventional lines, facilitating night trains, freight transport and military mobility, while strengthening Europe’s competitiveness in tourism and industry.

Scaling up investment in renewable, low-carbon fuels

The second initiative adopted today—the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan—sets out a common approach to boost investment in renewable and low-carbon fuels focusing on aviation and waterborne transport.

To meet the RefuelEU aviation and FuelEU maritime targets, around 20 million metric tons of sustainable fuels (biofuels and eFuels) will be needed by 2035.

Achieving this will require an estimated 100-billion euros (USD$115 billion) in investment.

The STIP sends a clear signal to investors that Europe’s targets remain in place and that the commission will support the transition to a climate-neutral economy.

By accelerating domestic production of biological and nonbiological fuels, Europe can reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels, enhance the competitiveness of its industries and lead the clean-energy transition globally.

Key investment measures aiming to mobilize at least 2.9-billion euros (USD$3.33 billion) through EU instruments by 2027 include:

At least 2-billion euros (USD$2.3 billion) for sustainable alternative fuels under InvestEU.

300-million euros (USD$344.6 million) through the European Hydrogen Bank to support hydrogen-based fuels for aviation and shipping.

446-million euros (USD$512.4 million) for synthetic aviation fuel and maritime fuel projects under the Innovation Fund.

133.5-million euros (USD$153.3 million) in fuels-related research and innovation under Horizon Europe.

On the top of these measures, the commission with the member states is preparing to launch an eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project by the end of 2025, aiming to mobilize at least 500-million euros (USD$574.2 million) for synthetic aviation fuel projects.

The commission will also work to strengthen the enabling conditions for market investments to bridge the investment gap.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_bfea5ec244fc4f19a2c3695e11bd2805~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_850,h_458,al_c,q_85/80995f_bfea5ec244fc4f19a2c3695e11bd2805~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-11-05 18:56:22.808807

AFBF’s key priorities include fair, enforceable trade agreements that protect market access; expanded support for biofuels such as ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel; and restoring whole milk options in schools to strengthen nutrition and dairy demand.

Newton also highlights the need to safeguard interstate commerce from conflicting state-level mandates, investigate pricing imbalances in fertilizer and equipment markets, and prioritize American-grown fruits and vegetables in federal purchasing. Each measure, he says, helps rebuild a dependable marketplace for producers.

News that Delta is now launching a new direct route between Atlanta and Riyadh is an exciting development. For the Saudi economy, the U.S. carrier’s entry is about more than just passenger travel. It enables tighter links to North America, stronger logistics flows, and the transfer of operational know-how that supports Vision 2030’s goals for smart mobility and diversified growth. The airline’s arrival in the Kingdom is set to add scale, reliability, and crucially, sustainability discipline at a critical moment.

The General Authority of Civil Aviation’s (GACA) Saudi Aviation Strategy puts environmental sustainability on par with safety and customer experience. The regulator launched the Civil Aviation Environmental Sustainability Program (CAESP) to guide operational improvements and the use of innovative fuels. Riyadh’s King Khalid International Airport has also joined an ACI-led Net Zero roadmap. Together, these steps create a strong foundation for Delta’s technology transfer.

At the national level, the Saudi Green Initiative targets net-zero emissions by 2060, framing aviation decarbonization as part of a broader energy transition. Bringing in a U.S. carrier like Delta Air Lines with demonstrable progress on fuel efficiency, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and ground service equipment electrification fits the Vision 2030 push to make the Kingdom a leader in green aviation and smart mobility.

Delta’s sustainability strategy aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Its roadmap emphasizes three levers: what it flies (newer, more efficient aircraft), how it flies (operational efficiencies), and the fuel it uses (scaling sustainable aviation fuel).

The airline has also created a cross-divisional “Carbon Council” which focuses on driving fuel-saving measures such as weight reduction, optimized procedures and engine-wash programs. Earlier this year, the airline reported cumulative jet fuel savings of 45 million gallons,* becoming the first U.S. airline to hit its near-term fuel-savings goal through operational improvements alone.

Delta’s strategy also calls for increasing SAF usage, supported by offtake agreements with several producers and by coalition work to localize SAF value chains (e.g., the Minnesota SAF Hub). These are the kinds of commercial and policy interventions Saudi stakeholders want to cultivate as they map a domestic SAF ecosystem.

Delta’s new partnership with Riyadh Air, announced in 2024, will enable collaboration on important areas including aircraft maintenance, ground handling, staff training and digital transformation once approved. This gives the Saudi aviation sector a direct channel to the operational know-how and sustainability toolkits of one of the world’s most reliable carriers.

The partnership can bring global best practices in efficiency to Saudi aviation such as advancing SAF, electrified ground operations, and next-gen technology in alignment with GACA’s CAESP framework and the Saudi Green Initiative. This will enable Riyadh to grow as a smart, low-carbon hub connecting the Kingdom to the world and accelerating Vision 2030.

In its Türkiye report, the IATA also underscored the aviation sector's crucial role in enabling the development of dynamic and efficient supply chains and in driving the growth in e-commerce.","The top global aviation body highlighted in a new report Türkiye's strong global standing in the air transport sector and its contributions to the economy, while also describing key priorities to continue generating benefits from it.

""Türkiye is a global aviation powerhouse. International passenger departures have surged by nearly 70% over the past decade, making Türkiye the world’s seventh-largest market by passenger departures,"" said the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

The association released ""The Value of Air Transport for Türkiye"" study at the IATA World Financial Symposium (WFS) and World Passenger Symposium (WPS) held in Istanbul this week. The event organized by IATA is hosted by Türkiye's flag carrier, Turkish Airlines (THY).

The opening of a two-day program on Wednesday was attended by top IATA management executives and the chair of Turkish Airlines, Ahmet Bolat.

The report published by IATA quantifies the substantial benefits that aviation, including aviation-related tourism, generates in terms of jobs and economic activity in Türkiye, based on 2023 data.

Highlights from 2023 data show that aviation supports and facilitates $82.4 billion of economic activity, when total impact, including wider supply chain, employee spending and tourism activities, is included, which equals 7.4% of gross domestic product (GDP), IATA said.

It also cited that the sector provides 2 million jobs indirectly, when wider supply chain and tourism activities are included, 53,000 of which are directly employed by airlines.

The aviation sector in Türkiye enjoyed a strong boom in recent decades and strong investment in infrastructure, which is visible in the opening of new air hubs as well as the expansion of existing ones, has propelled it to new heights. The opening of Istanbul Airport, the new runway at Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, the push to boost connectivity of the capital Ankara and new terminals at Antalya Airport serve as some of the examples of the aim for boosting connectivity and the country's position in aviation globally.

Key priorities

""Continued prioritization of aviation as a strategic sector anchored in competitive costs, sufficient capacity, and leveraging the opportunities that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers will be vital to sustaining Türkiye’s leadership in global air transport,"" said Nick Careen, IATA senior vice president of operations, safety and security.

Answering a question by Daily Sabah on the feasibility of bolstering passenger volumes and if low-cost carriers could play a role in this, Careen said that ""there is room for everyone.""

Citing as an example Turkish Airlines' launch of its low-cost subsidiary AJet, he noted there ""would be room for all types of models, (and) Türkiye won't be any different than that.""

""There is competition and that's healthy,"" he added.

""Tourism supported by aviation contributes $49.6 billion to the country’s GDP and employs 1.2 million people,"" the IATA survey also said.

Moreover, it also identified three key priorities for the country to continue generating benefits, including infrastructure, capacity-building and sustainability.

""As Türkiye makes significant investments in airport infrastructure and digitalization, it is critical to work with the industry to ensure cost competitiveness,"" it said. It also suggested that ensuring a skilled workforce across all areas of aviation will enable Türkiye to fulfill its ambitious growth strategy.

At the same time, on the sustainability side, it pointed out that leveraging the opportunities that SAF offers ""will be key to achieving Türkiye’s decarbonization goals.""

Türkiye's civil aviation authority announced earlier this year that the country will set mandates for airlines and jet fuel suppliers to enhance uptake of SAF, with a goal of curbing aviation emissions by 5% by 2030. The move is aimed at complying with the U.N. International Civil Aviation Organization's emission reduction scheme that will become mandatory in 2027.

In its Türkiye report, the IATA also underscored the aviation sector's crucial role in enabling the development of dynamic and efficient supply chains and in driving the growth in e-commerce. It also noted that 1.7 million tons of air cargo were transported through airports in Türkiye in 2023, supporting the country’s total import and export volumes.

Türkiye sits at a crossroads between Europe, Asia and Africa, and its flag carrier boasts a wide network – being the airline flying to more nations than any competitor. Turkish Airlines also aims to further expand its fleet and have more than 800 planes as part of its 2033 strategy.

Global air travel and demand have largely recovered in 2024 following COVID-19-related disruptions, and the IATA considers the sector will still continue to thrive ""despite noise which exists everywhere,"" as noted by Careen.

In a separate report, IATA released the results of its 2025 Global Passenger Survey (GPS), highlighting two key trends that are redefining the passenger travel experience – mobile reliance is rising and biometric adoption is accelerating.

""Travelers are increasingly using their smartphones to book flights, manage payments and loyalty programs, and handle check-in, immigration, boarding and baggage processes.

The initiative forms a core pillar of the EU’s Competitiveness Compass and Clean Industrial Deal, and marks the first EU-wide framework aimed specifically at mobilizing large-scale investment into sustainable transport fuels.

STIP responds to what the Commission describes as an urgent need to unlock capital and address production gaps as Europe approaches key milestones under ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime.

Meeting the combined requirements of both regulations will demand around 20 million tons of sustainable alternative fuels by 2035, including 13.2 Mt of biofuels and 6.8 Mt of e-fuels. The Commission estimates that reaching these levels will require approximately €100 billion ($115 billion) in investment over the next decade.

Early Financing Measures to Bridge Market Gaps

To provide clarity for developers and investors, the Commission emphasized that regulatory targets will remain stable and that STIP is intended to de-risk early projects. EU-level measures under the plan are expected to mobilize at least €2.9 billion ($3.33 billion) through 2027, spanning multiple funding mechanisms.

Key financial actions include the mobilization of €2 billion ($2.3 billion) through InvestEU to support sustainable fuel production, alongside €300 million ($345 million) through the European Hydrogen Bank for hydrogen-based aviation and maritime fuels.

Additional support includes €133 million ($153 million) for research and innovation via Horizon Europe, plus €446 million ($513 million) from the Innovation Fund for synthetic fuel – aviation and maritime applications.

The Commission will also launch an eSAF Early Movers Coalition by year-end, working with participating Member States to mobilize at least €500 million ($575 million) for early synthetic SAF production.

Looking beyond 2027, the Commission plans to develop an intermediary market mechanism that links fuel producers and buyers, offering revenue certainty to catalyze private investment. STIP also aims to reduce administrative burdens for airlines and shipping operators and to enhance international cooperation to safeguard EU industrial interests and maintain fair competition.

Industry organizations like the SASHA Coalition welcomed the new plan, however, with some criticism. “An extension of the ETS is still missing, and without it, we won’t generate the revenues needed to truly accelerate decarbonisation in aviation and maritime,” said Aurelia Leeuw, Director of EU Policy at the SASHA Coalition.

“And while it’s positive to see recognition of zero-emission aircraft and hydrogen’s role, support for zero-emission technologies across the board remains limited.”",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pexels-pixabay-262353-1024x683.png,N,,2025-11-05 09:56:25.149321

Asean nations such as Indonesia and Malaysia - alongside China - could supply about 240M tonnes, which would be 15% of total global biomass feedstock for SAF by 2050.
The report estimated that around 1,580M tonnes of feedstock could be allocated to SAF, enough to produce more than 300M tonnes of bio-based SAF in 2050.
Walsh said Asia would play a world leading role in the transition to net zero by 2050.
IATA senior vice president for sustainability and chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen also highlighted the Southeast Asia as a key region for the sector.","The region had vast feedstock potential and Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam were well-positioned to develop feedstocks that could be converted into sustainable fuels for the transport sector, Walsh said in the 21 October report.

“There’s an opportunity to develop a whole new industry, generate employment, reduce dependence on importing oil and create a positive outcome for the environment as well,” Walsh said during a media briefing at the IATA World Sustainability Symposium.

According to IATA’s ‘Global Feedstock Assessment for SAF Production – Outlook to 2050 ’ report, the world could produce up to 400M tonnes of SAF by 2050, a major increase from the estimated 2M tonnes in 2025 but still below the 500M tonnes required for the industry to reach net zero carbon emissions.

The IATA report highlighted Southeast Asia as one of the most promising regions for feedstock availability due to its agricultural residues, palm oil mill effluent (POME) and municipal solid waste that could be processed into SAF.

Asean nations such as Indonesia and Malaysia - alongside China - could supply about 240M tonnes, which would be 15% of total global biomass feedstock for SAF by 2050.

Biomass feedstock potential was projected to exceed 12,000M tonnes by 2050 globally, but less than 35% of that would realistically be available for bioenergy and biofuels due to competing needs in other industries.

The report estimated that around 1,580M tonnes of feedstock could be allocated to SAF, enough to produce more than 300M tonnes of bio-based SAF in 2050.

IATA senior vice president for sustainability and chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen also highlighted the Southeast Asia as a key region for the sector.

“This region is the main generator of the solutions we need for airlines’ decarbonisation over the coming decades.”

However, she added that while optimism remained high, the industry still needed to progress.

Recent ICCT research highlights why these advanced fuels—particularly synthetic fuels—are essential for decarbonizing both maritime shipping and aviation. However, it also identifies that high upfront capital costs and market uncertainties continue to delay final investment decisions. For example, our recent report on SAFs found these to be the main barriers still holding back fuel production. Without targeted support, Europe risks falling short of its 0.7% synthetic SAF target by 2030.these to be the main barriers still holding back fuel production. Without targeted support, Europe risks falling short of its 0.7% synthetic SAF target by 2030.

With the STIP, the Commission aims to tackle investment barriers with revenue certainty measures. To understand what’s at stake—and how far these measures might go—it’s worth revisiting the scale of the challenge.

E-fuels are necessary for long-term aviation and marine decarbonization

Synthetic fuels, which include e-fuels made from renewable electricity, water, and carbon dioxide, are a key focus of aviation and marine decarbonization efforts. This is due in part to a lack of viable alternatives. Second-generation biofuels produced from solid waste or cellulosic feedstocks can have very low GHG emissions, but their long-term contribution is constrained by resource availability. For aviation, hydrogen and battery powered aircraft face significant technology barriers and will be slow to displace aircraft used for the long-haul flights that generate the bulk of emissions from the sector. In contrast, e-fuels are scalable solutions, in the form of e-kerosene for the aviation sector and e-ammonia or e-methanol for the marine sector.

So, why do so many e-fuel and second-generation biofuel projects in Europe struggle to reach final investment decisions despite clear demand signals through the EU’s FuelEU Maritime and ReFuelEU Aviation regulations?

Let’s take a look at the aviation sector’s challenge with synthetic SAF, or e-kerosene, to understand.

The case of e-kerosene

Despite numerous project announcements, the largest e-kerosene plant operating in Europe produces approximately 2,000 tonnes of SAF per year, only 0.4% of what will be required in 2030 by EU and UK policies. Other projects have been cancelled or postponed, highlighting the challenge of going from project announcement to steel in the ground.

Our report helps explain why. Despite the synthetic fuel sub-mandates and significant non-compliance penalties, the future market price for synthetic SAF is difficult to predict. And with e-kerosene facilities requiring US$1–2 billion in construction costs, it may take decades to break even. Thus, the risk that pioneering facilities fail to cover costs due to policy shifts or low market prices is too high for most investors, particularly providers of debt capital.

To mitigate these risks, project developers typically turn to offtake contracts with airlines, but these are no panacea. Airlines with famously thin margins are in no hurry to lock in high fuel costs when competitors might be able to secure synthetic SAF at a lower cost in the future.

It’s a similar story for shippers. Bunker fuels are usually purchased on short contracts. But without these contracts, most synthetic fuel projects cannot raise money for preliminary engineering studies, let alone construction. And if construction doesn’t begin in a timely manner, there might not be enough synthetic fuel to meet ReFuelEU’s 2030 requirements, forcing policymakers into the uncomfortable position of penalizing jet fuel providers for not supplying fuel that doesn’t exist.

How the STIP can help

Luckily, there is a policy option. ICCT’s research shows that revenue certainty mechanisms—which allow the government to set a fixed long-term price, offering producers the predictability needed to secure investment—are the most effective way to unlock financing for first-of-a-kind fuel producers. Such mechanisms have been highly successful in the case of offshore wind projects, which face similar challenges of long payback periods and high levels of capital investment.

The STIP signals that the Commission recognizes the need for revenue certainty. In the case of SAF specifically, the STIP states that the Commission could extend the SAF allowances mechanism within the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which covers a certain percentage of the price gap between SAF and fossil jet fuel. While such a measure would reduce the cost of SAF for airlines, ICCT’s research suggests that additional revenue certainty benefiting SAF producers directly would also be key to bringing new production online.

Thus, the STIP proposes additional measures to support low-GHG marine and aviation fuels. The Commission will launch pilot projects, including one that sets up a double-sided auction for e-SAF. This double-sided auction will establish a “market intermediary” that connects SAF suppliers and consumers, offering long-term contracts to provide revenue certainty to fuel producers as well as short-term contracts on the offtake side. The Commission also commits to assessing the feasibility of an EU-wide double auction to support both aviation and marine sustainable fuels. If designed and implemented quickly, such measures could provide the certainty needed to get today’s advanced SAF and marine fuel projects off the ground and accelerate progress toward fulfilling ReFuelEU and FuelEU Maritime targets.

LanzaJet has secured ten million pounds from the United Kingdom Advanced Fuels Fund to advance Project Speedbird, an ethanol to SAF facility planned for Teesside. Fluor has now been appointed to perform the front end engineering and design FEED, the activity that converts conceptual sketches into a construction ready blueprint. Together, public finance and experienced engineering dramatically increase the likelihood that the plant will pass a final investment decision within the next eighteen months.

Community and Economic Benefits

The project expects to deliver more than ninety thousand tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel plus renewable diesel every year. Airlines will benefit directly, yet the ripple effects are equally notable. Hundreds of skilled positions will be needed during construction and operation, supporting local training providers and suppliers across the North East. By valorising waste derived ethanol, Project Speedbird also opens a new demand centre for agricultural residues, offering farmers an additional revenue stream without changing crop patterns.

An Overlooked Financial Advantage

One insight that often escapes attention is the revenue flexibility created by producing both SAF and road ready renewable diesel in a single plant. This product split lets the operator respond quickly to price signals in either market, smoothing cash flow and reducing exposure to any single offtake agreement. Financial institutions commonly view such optionality as a hedge, which can translate into more favourable lending terms and therefore lower overall project cost.

Conclusion

With government funding secured and Fluor advancing detailed design, Project Speedbird is converting vision into credible infrastructure. The dual product strategy, combined with regional job creation, positions Teesside as a cornerstone in the fast growing sustainable fuel economy for both air and land transport.

Energy Transition & Sustainability

Decoding SAF, a pathway to sustainable aviation

Sustainable aviation fuel is emerging as a pivotal element in the aviation industry's quest to achieve carbon neutrality. This infographic delves into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production routes, regional demand and price trends.

The transition to SAF is not without its hurdles. SAF production costs remain high, and other routes have lower carbon intensity reductions. Still, the adoption of SAF remains the airline industry's most scalable solution to cutting emissions.

Rolls-Royce is leading a new UK research initiative to understand how smarter use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) could help reduce the climate impact of contrails, the thin clouds of ice crystals that often trail behind aircraft.

The project, titled Quantifying Reduction in Thermal Contrails by Optimising SAF (QRITOS), brings together Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Imperial College London, and Heathrow Airport.

It is co-funded by the Non-CO₂ Programme under the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), in partnership with the Department for Business and Trade and Innovate UK.

While SAF’s role in cutting carbon emissions is well established, scientists believe its benefits could go further. Flight tests have shown that using SAF can reduce the number of ice crystals formed in contrails, thereby lowering their contribution to global warming.

Alan Newby, Director of Research and Technology at Rolls-Royce, said the company wants to unlock the wider environmental potential of SAF.

“SAF will not only play a vital role in decarbonising aviation, but has also been shown to reduce certain non-CO₂ emissions,” he said. “This project will demonstrate smarter ways of using SAF, which could unlock additional value through reducing non-CO₂ climate effects as well.”

How targeted use of SAF could reduce contrail warming

Because the current supply of SAF is limited, QRITOS will explore how best to deploy it.

Rather than blending small quantities across all flights, the team will examine whether prioritising aircraft most likely to produce persistent contrails could deliver greater environmental gains.

Constantly changing weather conditions mean that only a small proportion of flights are responsible for most of aviation’s contrail-related warming.

The project will combine British Airways flight trials, advanced modelling, and satellite observations to monitor contrail formation when SAF is used strategically.

Project manager Marcin Dutka from Rolls-Royce said early measurements show clear promise.

“Measurements have already shown that fuel composition can influence contrail properties,” he said. “This project aims to demonstrate how contrail climate impact might be reduced by targeting SAF at flights predicted to form persistent contrails.”

Rolls-Royce leads UK aviation project to cut non-CO₂ emissions

UK Industry Minister Chris McDonald said QRITOS shows how collaboration between government, academia, and business can accelerate sustainable innovation.

“This is government and business working together at its best,” he said. “I look forward to seeing how this Rolls-Royce project can help keep UK industry at the forefront of the race for sustainable aviation.”

The two-year project, due to conclude in April 2027, will also improve forecasting methods and enhance contrail modelling using satellite data.

Tom Byrne, British Airways’ Head of Net Zero and Environment, said the airline sees SAF as central to the future of flight.

“Through the QRITOS project, we’re exploring how SAF can go beyond reducing carbon emissions to also help minimise the climate impact of contrails,” he said. “By combining research, satellite data, and real-world flight trials, we’re working to unlock smarter, more targeted use of SAF — ensuring that every drop delivers maximum benefit.”

Matt Gorman, Director of Carbon Strategy at Heathrow, said the airport is proud to support research into practical ways to cut non-CO₂ emissions.

“As SAF continues to scale, it’s important to examine how we can use it to deliver the greatest climate benefit,” he said.

Imperial College London’s Associate Professor Sebastian Eastham added that the project will advance both scientific understanding and technical tools.

“We will develop and trial advanced computational contrail modelling and satellite image analysis techniques,” he said. “This is a great opportunity to learn about the potential benefits of targeted SAF use and to improve our ability to detect and analyse contrails.”

What are contrails and how do they affect climate change?

Contrails — short for condensation trails — form when aircraft engines emit water vapour, soot, and other particles into cold, humid air at high altitude. The vapour condenses around these particles, creating tiny ice crystals that appear as white streaks across the sky.

Most contrails disappear quickly, but some linger and spread into thin cirrus clouds that trap heat escaping from the Earth’s surface. These persistent contrails can have a measurable warming effect on the atmosphere.

Studies suggest that while contrails last only a few hours, their short-term warming impact can exceed that of the CO₂ released by the same flight.

At night, when no sunlight is reflected back into space, contrails act like a blanket, trapping heat and amplifying warming. During the day, they have a dual effect, reflecting some sunlight while still retaining heat.

Scientists estimate that fewer than 3% of global flights produce around 80% of contrail-related warming. This concentration means that targeting specific flights or routes, through smart SAF deployment or route adjustments, could substantially reduce aviation’s non-CO₂ climate footprint.

Tackling aviation’s CO₂ and non-CO₂ climate impact

Aviation contributes roughly 2% of global CO₂ emissions, but its total warming impact is significantly higher once non-CO₂ effects such as contrails are included.

Despite remaining uncertainties over their precise impact, experts agree that contrails significantly amplify aviation’s climate footprint.

The QRITOS project represents a new step in addressing that challenge, not by replacing decarbonisation efforts, but by complementing them with improved atmospheric understanding and smarter fuel use.

As Eastham noted, enhancing the ability to predict and measure contrails will be vital to ensuring new technologies deliver genuine climate benefits.

“This project will deepen our scientific understanding and help aviation take another step toward truly sustainable flight,” he said.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_1719472789-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-05 08:17:15.641746

The world’s attention will be focused on COP30 in Brazil over the coming two weeks. As with all COPs, it’s an important opportunity to take stock of where we are at regarding the efforts to decarbonize air transport.

But first, let’s clarify who does what in that domain. Domestic air transport falls under the responsibility of national governments and is relevant to the UNFCCC COP process as States need to report on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC). International aviation has been under the responsibility of the UN special agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for 80 years.

It’s been almost a decade since ICAO member States agreed in 2016 to establish a globally harmonized scheme called CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) to tackle CO2 emissions from international air transport. Early last month, the ICAO Assembly reviewed its progress, looking at how well CORSIA is working. When fully operational, aviation’s international carbon emissions should be stabilized at 85% of 2019 levels.

The significance of CORSIA should not be underestimated in the effort to decarbonize flying. CORSIA is the first and only global agreement to manage CO2 emissions of an industrial sector. Governments have agreed that it will be the only economic measure applied to international aviation, preserving fairness. This principle was reaffirmed at the recent ICAO 42nd Assembly. Thanks to ICAO’s quality criteria for CORSIA carbon credits, they are the most sought-after in the carbon credit market. A fully developed, transparent, liquid, and trusted carbon market will be able to raise money from all kinds of global investors for projects in mostly developing countries that generate certified CO2 emissions reductions. What is there not to love?

Over CORSIA’s lifetime until 2035, airlines will likely pay between USD 30-60 billion to be compliant with their obligations under CORSIA, and voluntary demand for credits has great potential. However, countries that have eligible projects may choose to use their credits for other purposes than for air transport, or they might find the necessary administrative and other procedures too difficult to overcome. This has resulted in an acutely under-supplied market where Guyana is currently the only State that has made credits available in the market. It is a most perplexing paradox that the UN Member States in ICAO put an obligation on airlines to buy CORSIA credits, but the same UN Member States under COP are not obliged to make the credits available to airlines.

In that light, it is both exasperating and disappointing that many States are putting forward proposals that undermine CORSIA. That includes the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force, which was initiated at COP28 to investigate novel sources of funding for climate action, as well as the EU’s so far failed attempts to impose its ETS extra-territorially. Such initiatives completely ignore the commitment the same States made at ICAO - that CORSIA should be the single, one and only solution for charging international airlines for their CO2 emissions.

Of course, carbon credits are only one part of air transport’s decarbonization. The major contribution to our industry’s emissions reductions will be from replacing fossil-based jet fuel with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Today though, there is only enough SAF in the world to cover less than 1% of our energy needs. Why? Fundamentally because government incentives continue to favor fossil fuels, making these energies a much more lucrative investment than renewable fuels.

There is a common message for governments emanating from the current state of play regarding both SAF and CORSIA. It can be summed up in one word—clarity.

CORSIA is a great mechanism and achievement. Governments must unambiguously support its success and refrain from undermining it by introducing competing and duplicative taxes and charges.

SAF is the game changer for decarbonizing aviation and a vector for growth in its own right. Governments must support the production ramp-up of SAF with incentives and policies that clearly make it a winning investment - and one that will benefit all users of renewable fuels, of which market air transport only represents around 10%.

At the 42nd ICAO Assembly governments gave us assurances of this clarity. Over the three years until the next Assembly, we need to see this materializing in real policies and initiatives. And over the next weeks at COP30, we count on those same governments to demonstrate their will to enact policies that are consistent with their goals, provide the clarity that investors need, and take advantage of the opportunities that come in its wake.

Domestic airlines in producing countries would enter long-term offtake agreements at Jet fuel prices and become the enablers of this bilateral book and claim system under Article 6.","The global aviation industry stands at a defining crossroads. It is caught between the reality of its high carbon emissions, expected demand growth and the barriers to scaling and adopting the complex array of emerging sustainable and technological innovations. Although accounting for a relatively low share of global emissions relative to other sectors, it is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise which represents a huge challenge. This is particularly critical in Latin America, where aviation serves as a fundamental enabler of connectivity, territorial cohesion and economic development in ways that differ markedly from more mature markets in Europe, Asia and the United States.

Achieving net-zero aviation by 2050 is ambitious. Emerging markets passengers generally travel less, and increasingly in newer, more efficient aircraft which also tend to carry more passengers per flight leading to lower emissions intensity per seat flown. In line with the UNFCCC common but differentiated responsibilities principles, the realities of developing countries with relatively smaller environmental footprints and urgent economic needs must be considered. Our industry must collaborate globally, and quickly, to unlock and optimize the decarbonization solutions available today and those needed for the future across all regions.

SAF scaleup challenges

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF could deliver as much as two-thirds of the sector’s global emissions reductions by 2050. Yet today, SAF makes up less than 1 percent of global aviation fuel use. This gap must be closed – with haste but also in a truly sustainable and just manner. Global demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is expected to reach more than 400mn tons by 2050. SAF demand from developed countries with limited feedstocks is expected to surge particularly in the EU, UK, Japan and Singapore. Developing countries with existing renewable fuels infrastructure and feedstock availability such as Brazil can seize the opportunity to become SAF exporters at scale but face significant challenges:

Financing for SAF projects is limited due to the lack of long-term off-take agreements from airlines. High domestic fuel prices, regulatory complexity, and economic uncertainty are holding investment back.

Fuel costs represent around 40% of Brazilian airlines operating costs and regional customer demand is highly sensitive to price.

In 2023, the Brazilian Airlines Association (ABEAR) found that Brazilian jet fuel was as much as 50 percent more expensive than in the United States – driven by domestic pricing policies, taxes, and currency volatility.

Based on current global market developments, the cost of SAF could be over 4 times higher than the average price of conventional jet fuel

At these price points, it will not be feasible for countries to scale SAF adoption without ticket prices increasing materially, sacrificing customer affordability, territorial connectivity and economic development in their domestic markets. There is simply no realistic economic model for SAF without support for the end customer and limited leeway from developing country governments with numerous other priorities to provide it.

Moreover, there are multiple pathways to producing SAF – including waste oils like used cooking oil, biomass including agricultural residues, oils from agricultural crops, municipal solid waste, algae and other advanced bio-based materials. Despite the variety, not all feedstocks deliver the right climate benefits, and some raise serious concerns around land use and nature impact in relation to biodiversity and water at systems level.

A blueprint for collaborative financing

At ABRA Group – one of Latin America’s largest airline groups owning Avianca, a Colombian airline, Gol the second largest Brazilian airline as well as Wamos, a wet lease company, we lead in terms of operational efficiencies and seek to identify solutions which are pragmatic, workable and rely on existing mechanisms and frameworks which can be adapted to solve some of the intractable challenges for our industry. We believe SAF can be one of the long-term solutions available to aviation if it complies with two key sustainability principles:

Financial sustainability across the value chain and regional markets

Environmental sustainability: protecting against unintended consequences by focusing beyond carbon emissions reductions. Any solutions must also consider potential impacts on nature (understood as water & biodiversity at landscape and systems level)

Developing countries with SAF production capabilities such as Brazil, can and should supply the world with the SAF needed, but the investment model does not work due to the relative cost of SAF vs jet, the financial reality of regional airlines and potential resulting impact on connectivity and economic development. Currently, the key barrier to investment in SAF projects is ultimately price; and without resolving the issue of demand, SAF projects are not securing the financing needed.

We believe collaborative solutions, where advanced economies support the development of the industry in developing countries, are the future and will provide credibility to unlock financing, reduce implementation costs for all involved and provide assurance for the true environmental sustainability of SAF. Through our active participation in regional SAF policy conversations and established network across multiple Latin American countries, we are uniquely positioned to help shape these collaborative frameworks.

Today, we are proposing leveraging the Article 6 framework of the Paris Agreement to channel investment from developed economies with limited SAF feedstocks to developing countries with SAF production potential via bilateral Book and Claim agreements. Such arrangements would have three key benefits:

Unlock financing to produce SAF in the most cost-efficient locations

Consolidate SAF production under international norms and standards to avoid damaging domestic-only policies

Protect the sustainability of SAF at scale by enabling the highest environmental standards as required by developed economies and passengers with the ability to pay

Proposal: leverage Article 6 bilateral agreements to enable collaborative financing of SAF

SAF importer countries, for example Japan or Singapore, can unlock financing of SAF projects in developing producer countries by entering into long-term offtake agreements for the emissions reductions delivered by SAF in the form of SAFc (Scope 1) certificates. A portion of such emissions reductions would be contributed back by the developed country to the producing country for the latter to achieve its own objectives under its NDCs –therefore avoiding double counting. Domestic airlines in producing countries would enter long-term offtake agreements at Jet fuel prices and become the enablers of this bilateral book and claim system under Article 6. Other third parties such as multilateral agencies can also provide additional temporary support until the price of SAF reaches long term sustainable levels for all.

The motivation for developed countries to do this can stem from various factors:

The desire to ensure energy security through bilateral agreements in a multilateral world, support key allies or national champions with access to feedstocks at scale

As a strategy to reach its own NDCs via the use of carbon credits in the form of SAFc’s while supporting renewable energy markets

As a strategy to enable more cost – and emissions-efficient SAF for its domestic airlines to reach their own NDC targets (since neither SAF or its feedstocks need to be transported under this mechanism and SAF can be produced in more cost-effective jurisdictions)

Other third parties can eventually also be involved in this collaborative cost sharing arrangement such as multilateral agencies who can support Revenue Assurance mechanisms for a period of time and airline customers who can contribute through payments for their Scope 3 emissions reductions generated by this system.

All parties benefit

We believe this system addresses key challenges but also distributes the benefits fairly and across all participants. Governments of developed markets achieve their emissions reductions and energy objectives, developing countries unlock financing to build renewable energy industries, increase employment and knowledge sharing, while their airlines can continue to provide the essential connectivity needed to support economic development. Developed country airlines potentially benefit from access to high quality, cost effective SAF to complement that produced domestically, and SAF producers can access financing needed by demonstrating secure long term offtake agreements under Article 6 therefore unlocking production of SAF at scale around the world to serve the needs of the airline industry.

The benefits of SAF for reducing end-to-end CO2 emissions from fuel are well understood, and SAF is expected to play a key role in aviation’s decarbonisation journey. However, in-flight measurements behind aircraft have also shown SAF’s potential to reduce the number of ice crystals in contrails and therefore the potential climate impact of these thin clouds of ice particles that can form behind aircraft.

The amount of SAF currently available is only a small proportion of aviation’s overall fuel requirements. It is typically mixed with conventional fossil fuel, resulting in wide-scale deployment at very low SAF blend ratios. However, SAF use is expected to increase in the UK with the introduction of the SAF mandate which came into force at the start of the year and will see 10% of SAF in the UK fuel in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

Constantly changing weather means different flights cause contrails at different times and locations, yet most of the potential climate impact comes from only a small proportion of flights. This creates an opportunity for smart SAF use targeting those flights expected to form persistent contrails. The QRITOS project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, at one of the world’s busiest airports. It will do this by combining data from British Airways flight trials, advanced modelling and satellite observations to monitor contrail formation following this targeted SAF usage.

The project aims to show that we can prioritise particular flights for SAF, focusing on where it can deliver the greatest environmental benefit and maximise the effectiveness of the current levels of supply.

The Non-CO2 Programme focuses on addressing challenges with reducing non-CO2 emissions from aircraft, as outlined in the ATI’s Non-CO2 Technologies Roadmap. The funding programme is delivered by the Aerospace Technology Institute, Department for Business and Trade (DBT) and Innovate UK, in partnership with the Department for Transport (DfT) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

Industry Minister Chris McDonald said: “This is government and business working together at its best, and I look forward to seeing how this Rolls-Royce project can help keep UK industry at the forefront of the race for sustainable aviation.

“We’re bolstering our support for the aerospace industry through our modern Industrial Strategy – giving business the confidence it needs to invest in UK advanced manufacturing and delivering on growth as part of our Plan for Change.”

Concluding in April 2027, the two-year project will also enhance forecasting methods, advance understanding and modelling of contrail formation, and develop verification methods based on satellite data.

A second phase, scheduled to double capacity to 250 million litres per year with a further USD 100 million investment, would lift potential domestic output to 36% of the target.

Project milestones and implementation

Over the past year, MENA Biofuels has secured land adjacent to MENA Terminals from the Government of Fujairah, completed feasibility, topographic and hydrological studies, and appointed Dynatron FZE as project manager.

It has also selected a technology provider for converting waste feedstocks into SAF and commissioned MUC Engineering, Fujairah Branch to conduct the Environmental Impact Assessment and oversee NOC requirements.

The company has contracted Robert Wright, former CEO of the European Biofuels Association, to advise on policy and regulation.

The project aligns with the UAE’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Roadmap 2030 and Net Zero 2050 strategy, offering airlines a domestic supply route for certified SAF rather than relying solely on imports.

Offtake and commercial progress

At ADIPEC 2025, MENA Biofuels signed a strategic offtake MoU with Emarat in the presence of Suhail bin Mohammed Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure. A similar agreement is expected to be signed at the Dubai Airshow, formalising early demand ahead of commercial production.

Ali Khalifa Al Shamsi, Chief Executive Officer of Emarat, said that the project requires “investors, technology and distributors pulling in one direction.”

Further stating that the agreement aims to accelerate locally produced, certified SAF volumes from Fujairah, “twelve months from concept to implementation sends a clear signal that the UAE is serious about sustainable aviation fuel.”

EPCC tendering and next steps

MENA Biofuels has launched the first of two Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Commissioning (EPCC) tenders, covering receiving, storage and distribution facilities for feedstock, SAF and by-products.

The package forms the logistical backbone of the project. A second tender for the refinery process units and associated infrastructure is scheduled for Q1 2026.

Captain Salem Al Afkham, Director of FOIZ, described the project as “a defining milestone for the UAE and Fujairah,” saying it supports the emirate’s ambition to diversify its energy mix and move into cleaner, higher-value fuels, positioning FOIZ beyond its traditional role as a storage and bunkering hub.

In Afkham’s words, FOIZ is evolving into “a fully integrated energy ecosystem” capable of converting feedstocks into sustainable fuels, reinforcing the UAE’s clean-energy agenda.

It will ultimately help transition the company from demonstration to full-scale operations.

The team will explore how the fuel, produced with OXCCU's novel iron-based Fischer-Tropsch catalyst, can potentially reduce the warming associated with burning hydrocarbon fuel in a jet turbine.

The focus will include soot particles, which can cause cloud formation at altitude and therefore impact global warming – though the amount of warming these particles cause is dependent on conditions and subject to ongoing research.

It comes as the UK pushes for 10 per cent of jet fuel to use SAF by 2030.

Sustainable aviation fuel isn’t just a fuel, it’s a bridge that connects economic growth with environmental stewardship.","Every generation faces a defining challenge. Ours is the climate crisis. But within this challenge, lies the greatest opportunity of our lifetime – to redesign how we live, move and grow in balance with the planet.

At LanzaJet, we see this as an invitation to reimagine energy systems for a world that works with, not against, our environment. We were founded on a simple but powerful premise: That technology, innovation and collaboration can decarbonise flight, and in doing so, unlock prosperity that is shared, sustained and regenerative.

With that effect, our sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is not just a cleaner drop-in replacement for fossil jet fuel, but represents a rethinking of the fuel economy itself. One that aligns the wellbeing of people, planet and industry.

Steering towards a net zero future for aviation

Aviation connects the world. It supports 65 million jobs globally and underpins nearly 4% of the world’s GDP. Yet, aviation also accounts for over 2% of global CO2 emissions, and its climate impact extends beyond that, through non-CO2 effects like contrails, the thin white lines behind high-flying aircraft that may look harmless but contribute to climate warming.

The unfortunate truth is that if aviation were a country, it would rank among the world’s top 10 emitters. But we believe this sector that brings humanity closer together, can also help lead in bringing us back in balance with the planet.

LanzaJet’s mission is to enable the aviation industry’s net-zero transition through scalable, affordable and sustainable fuel solutions. Our Ethanol-to-Jet (EtJ) technology converts low-carbon ethanol into a drop-in fuel, compatible with existing aircraft. That means airlines don’t need to build new engines or redesign planes. Instead, they can start cutting emissions immediately by using this sustainable fuel in place of conventional jet fuel – making the transition to cleaner flight faster, cheaper and more scalable.

And the impact is significant. Compared to conventional jet fuel, SAF from LanzaJet can deliver around 80% reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over its lifecycle.

To make this tangible, using LanzaJet SAF on a single long-haul flight can save roughly 80 tonnes of CO2, equivalent to the annual energy use of 10 average US households. Scaled to an industry level, those savings turn into gigaton-level impacts, comparable to the emissions of entire economies.

This is no longer just about compliance. It’s about opportunity creation. A future where flying supports, rather than undermines, climate and community resilience.

The process from waste to fuel

The way we produce and use energy is being rewritten. LanzaJet’s approach epitomises the circular economy in action, converting low-value and waste-derived feedstocks such as agricultural and woody residues, municipal solid waste and regenerative crops, into high-value sustainable aviation fuel.

Instead of pulling carbon from underground, we recycle the carbon already in circulation. Each gallon of sustainable aviation fuel displaces a gallon of fossil-derived jet fuel, reducing the need for new crude extraction.

Our technology, originally pioneered at the US Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, was designed to operate at commercial scale, bridging lab innovation and real-world deployment. The process demonstrates that sustainability and profitability can coexist, when we value circularity and resource efficiency. In every geography, this enables the creation of futureproofed, local value chains and shared benefit.

The ecological, biodiversity and social impact of sustainable aviation fuel

Ecological impact:

Each tonne of sustainable aviation fuel used prevents around 3 tonnes of CO2 from entering the atmosphere. Consequently, replacing 10% of total aviation fuel demand with SAF could help avoid emissions equivalent to the annual output of 25 million cars.

Biodiversity:

By prioritising regenerative, waste or residue-based feedstocks, we minimise new land use, prevent deforestation and biodiversity loss. This helps to ensure that every gallon of fuel is traceable, sustainable and capable of delivering measurable co-benefits beyond carbon savings, to the likes of soil health, water and air quality and biodiversity.

Social and economic inclusion:

The transition to sustainable aviation fuel is not just about reducing emissions, it’s also about building a wellbeing economy. One that creates green jobs, revitalises rural communities and fosters equitable growth.

At our Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia, the world’s first commercial Ethanol-to-Jet plant, we’ve created hundreds of new direct and indirect jobs. The site also serves as a living laboratory, documenting process data, operational learnings and workforce development strategies that will accelerate replication worldwide.

Scaling to meet aviation’s 2050 net zero goal

Freedom Pines is just the beginning. LanzaJet’s global pipeline spans partnerships across the world, with pre-2030 developments underway across the United Kingdom, India, Japan, Australia and Kazakhstan.

By 2030, we aim to enable more than 1 billion gallons of SAF production capacity annually, a critical milestone toward aviation’s 2050 net-zero target. Each new facility will integrate the learnings from Freedom Pines, driving down costs, improving efficiency and shortening the time from concept to commercial operation.

Looking further ahead, the opportunity is profound. Sustainable aviation fuel isn’t just a fuel, it’s a bridge that connects economic growth with environmental stewardship. In transforming waste into flight, we’re proving that climate action has become a business advantage, in addition to a moral imperative.

The climate crisis demands courage, creativity and collective action.

It asks us to look beyond incremental change and toward transformation; to see decarbonisation not as a constraint, but as the Opportunity of a Lifetime.

At LanzaJet, we’re answering that call. Pioneering a future where aviation uplifts not just people in the air, but the planet we share below.

2025 is a critical year for the Paris Agreement. Ten years on, we need to rethink how we frame the challenge. And seeing challenges differently is what business and we are all about.

ICC is committed to securing what businesses need at the upcoming climate negotiations, COP30, in Belém, Brazil. Learn more about our Opportunity of a Lifetime climate campaign and how to get involved.

Complete Interview with Mr. Jimmy Samartzis

Q: Please provide an overview of your professional journey and leadership experience in sustainable fuels, and how these experiences have influenced your vision and approach as CEO of LanzaJet in pioneering next-generation aviation fuel solutions.

Mr. Jimmy Samartzis: I often reflect upon the idea that the evolution of sustainable aviation fuel has mirrored my own professional journey. My career started in government and policy with a front row seat at the highest levels of the US government, including at The White House, witnessing the complexities of international affairs. My early career was spent in strategy consulting, helping organizations undergo complex transformations in the oil and gas, aviation, and national security industries. When I joined United Airlines, I had the opportunity to apply this background of working across the public and private sectors to a global stage, leading efforts that combined business strategy, sustainability, corporate responsibility, and innovation across one of the world’s largest and most operationally complex companies.

As an executive at United, I often took on the role of an intrapreneur, advancing innovation across the airline and the industry. I experienced the challenges and the promise of sustainable aviation fuel first-hand. In the first decade of the 21st century, when most people thought alternative fuels were just a dream, I was fortunate to help lead early initiatives that proved SAF could work technically, commercially, and operationally. That experience fundamentally shaped my perspective. I learned that advancing this sector requires technology that would reshape an 80-year-old fossil jet fuel industry, alongside persistence, partnerships, new supply chains, and global alignment.

In turn, I had the unique opportunity to join LanzaJet as its Founding CEO, shaping the company from the ground up, spanning our business strategy, culture and relationships, complementing the technology development previously conducted. LanzaJet allowed me to bring my full skillset built over two decades from government policy and business strategy to technology development and operations. I was able to carry forward the momentum that started from my time at United, into an opportunity allowing me to seek out global impact and scale.

I carry forward the lessons of those early days: collaboration and alignment across our global industry is key; sustainability must be a shared responsibility and anchored in financial viability; and impact only matters when it’s measurable, equitable, and lasting.

Q: Could you outline LanzaJet’s current strategic priorities, particularly in the context of your collaboration with KazMunayGas (KMG) to develop Kazakhstan’s first Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) facility? How important are such international partnerships in driving regional and global SAF adoption?

Mr. Jimmy Samartzis: Our focus is on using ethanol as a feedstock and deploying our proprietary and industry leading technology to transform ethanol into a drop-in renewable transportation fuel – both SAF and renewable diesel. Ethanol is a terrific building block molecule that allows us to using existing supply, enable it to be created from many waste sources and energy crops, and pivot it from a declining need in road transportation due to electrification to aviation as a promising, long-term market. This work allows us to build rural economies, support energy security needs, achieve decarbonization goals, and in some countries, further national security objectives.

Our partnership with KazMunayGas (KMG) is a milestone not just for Kazakhstan, but for the global SAF industry. Together, we’re developing the country’s and the Central Asia region’s first SAF facility, leveraging our LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology and KMG’s regional strength to create a model of local innovation serving global goals.

This partnership embodies our broader strategy to scale SAF production, build regional capacity and the local economy, and foster meaningful international collaboration. The future of sustainable fuels depends on this kind of cross-border partnership, where technology, resources, and ambition intersect.

Kazakhstan has the opportunity to lead Central Asia in clean energy innovation. By combining KMG’s energy expertise with LanzaJet’s proven SAF platform and industry-building expertise, we’re not just engineering a biorefinery, we’re building a foundation for regional energy security, agricultural development, industrial diversification, and long-term climate impact.

Q: How is the global demand for sustainable aviation fuel evolving, and how does LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology address these market dynamics while reducing carbon emissions?

Mr. Jimmy Samartzis: The demand for sustainable aviation fuel has moved from aspiration to urgency. Airlines, cargo operators, private aviation, and even corporate travel programs are setting aggressive SAF targets. Yet, supply still trails far behind. To put it in perspective, the aviation industry has set goals to achieve net zero by 2050 and with today’s jet fuel demand of more than 100 billion gallons, SAF production available today only accounts for less than 0.5%. The industry has a long way to go to achieve interim targets of 5%, 10%, and ultimately net zero, particularly with continued expansion and growth of the aviation industry.

This is exactly why LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology is essential. It converts ethanol, which is already produced on a massive global scale, into drop-in jet fuel that can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. Because ethanol can come from a variety of sources, from waste-based and cellulosic materials to low-carbon feedstocks and energy crops, ATJ offers unparalleled flexibility that is relevant to every continent in the world.

This adaptability allows us to build projects where feedstock, infrastructure and demand already exist, helping accelerate SAF availability worldwide. In essence, ATJ bridges the gap between today’s ethanol economy and tomorrow’s sustainable aviation industry.

Q: Beyond airlines, sectors such as agriculture, logistics, and energy security are key enablers for SAF. How does LanzaJet integrate these cross-sector linkages into its project design and long-term strategy to maximize impact?

Mr. Jimmy Samartzis: One of the most important lessons I’ve learned over the years is that sustainability doesn’t happen in silos. Aviation’s decarbonization depends on agriculture, logistics and energy systems evolving together, in tandem with the worlds of finance and policy.

At LanzaJet, we design every project as part of a wider ecosystem. We work with farmers to develop sustainable biomass and waste-based feedstocks, creating new value streams in rural economies. We partner with logistics providers to integrate existing infrastructure for ethanol and jet fuel transport, minimizing new emissions. And we collaborate with governments and energy companies to strengthen local energy independence through SAF production.

This systems-level approach ensures our projects do more than reduce emissions; they build resilience, prosperity, and inclusion. Our work with KMG reflects that. It’s as much about national strategy and regional cooperation as it is about aviation fuel.

Q: What are the most critical operational, financial, or innovation-related challenges currently facing LanzaJet as it scales SAF production globally, and how are you navigating them?

Mr. Jimmy Samartzis: Scaling a new global energy sector is never simple. The challenges and risk span technology, financing, feedstock availability, policy frameworks, and many others. But the most pressing challenge right now is speed; meeting rapidly growing demand while ensuring projects remain both economically and environmentally sustainable.

We’re addressing that by focusing on replicable project models that reduce design and engineering time, strengthening partnerships that balance risk and investing in R&D to improve yield and lower production costs.

Our LanzaJet Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Georgia, the world’s first commercial-scale ATJ plant, is a proof point. It demonstrates our technology, but that it can deliver scale and real carbon reductions. Every project we build now benefits from that experience and the de-risking we have invested in for our customers and partners, allowing us to move faster and smarter.

Q: Looking ahead, what major milestones does LanzaJet aim to achieve over the next year, particularly in terms of project deployment, technology advancement?

Mr. Jimmy Samartzis: The year ahead will be transformational for LanzaJet. We’ll continue learning from our Georgia facility and its operations, progress the KMG collaboration into early engineering and project development, and advance projects already underway in the UK and emerging markets like Australia, India and Japan.

Equally important is deepening our partnerships with airlines, investors, and governments, in order to create the enabling conditions for SAF to thrive. On the technology side, we’re pushing forward on process enhancements, innovations, and expanding our feedstock platform, to further improve carbon intensity and cost.

Each of these milestones moves us closer to a world where SAF isn’t the exception, but the norm.

Q: Innovation is not just about technology but also about leadership and culture. How do you foster a culture of innovation at LanzaJet, and what guiding principles help you lead the company in such a transformative sector?

Mr. Jimmy Samartzis: For me, innovation starts with people, not products. It’s about creating an environment where ideas can surface freely, where experimentation is encouraged, where diverse talents of people come together, and where failure is treated as learning.

At LanzaJet, we anchor our culture around a shared mission, accelerating the clean energy transition for aviation so that future generations can continue to fly and thrive through the benefits that travel brings to our economy and society. That mission gives our teams a sense of purpose and unity, even in the face of uncertainty. We emphasize transparency, collaboration, and accountability, values that not only define how we work but also how we lead.

Leading a company requires flexibility, especially given an ever-evolving geopolitical landscape, changing business strategies in both aviation and the oil and gas industries, as well as the uncertainty of capital. We work to shape these industries and global outcomes, but they are complex. We build capability and muscle to navigate uncertainty and risk, and I often spend time helping my team understand these complexities and work to succeed through them.

As CEO, my role is to keep our mission alive, to remind everyone why their work matters, and how we’re succeeding in unchartered waters. When people feel connected to purpose, innovation and execution excellence follows naturally!

Q: Please share your insights on emerging trends and opportunities shaping the future of sustainable fuels—from SAF and hydrogen integration to synthetic fuels—and where you see LanzaJet’s most exciting growth opportunities over the next decade.

Mr. Jimmy Samartzis: The next decade will redefine the energy and aviation landscape. We’re seeing rapid progress in hydrogen, e-fuels, and carbon capture, and I believe the future will be one of convergence, where these technologies complement rather than compete.

For LanzaJet, that could mean expanding beyond bio-based SAF production. To that effect, our ATJ technology platform can integrate with renewable power, captured carbon and green hydrogen, in order to create a Power-to-Liquid SAF from e-Ethanol, capable of delivering even lower emissions.

Overall, what excites me most is that the world is no longer asking if SAF can scale, but rather how fast this can take place. We know there is a $1 Trillion total addressable market, underpinned by aviation’s need for up to 400-500 million metric Tonnes of SAF by 2050, in order to meet its Net Zero 2050 target. LanzaJet’s role is to help make that scale real, and we’re doing all the right things to help our company and industry both succeed!

Renewable diesel and other biofuels production capacity increased by 391M gallons (1.48bn litres)/year in 2024, less than one-third of the growth in 2022 and 2023.

In 2024, only two capacity additions came online, both in California: Phillips 66’s conversion of its Rodeo refinery to produce exclusively biofuels and the new Renewable Fuels LLC plant in Bakersfield, the report said.

Following its completed conversion, the Rodeo plant had a capacity of 767M gallons (2.9bn litres)/year, up from 180M gallons (681M litres)/year in the EIA’s report last year.

The increase made it the second-largest renewable diesel plant in the USA, after Diamond Green Diesel’s 982M gallons (3.7bn litres)/year plant in Norco, Louisiana.

US capacity growth from the Rodeo expansion and the 138M gallons (522M litres)/year Bakersfield plant was partially offset by the loss of capacity at four facilities, according to the report.

Monroe Energy and Chevron stopped co-processing renewable diesel at their Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, refineries, respectively, while Vertex Energy and Jaxon Energy closed plants in Mobile, Alabama, and Jackson, Mississippi, respectively.

Africa has the resources to fuel a greener future. Furkan Özdemir, Aviation Lecturer at Atilim University, explores how local innovation and smart policy could help the continent turn waste into sustainable aviation fuel.

One thing is becoming increasingly evident when discussing the future of aviation: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is no longer an option; it is a necessity. Airlines worldwide are under increasing pressure to reduce their carbon emissions. SAF has become a viable option for reducing the carbon footprint of air travel. The story gets more complicated when it comes to Africa, though.

Is it realistic for a continent with little money, poor infrastructure and big economic differences to take part in this green revolution? The answer is complicated, but hopeful.

The cost conundrum

Let’s start with the numbers. Making SAF is still expensive. Biofuel-based SAF costs about €1,461 per tonne in Europe, while e-fuels can cost up to €7,695 per tonne, which is three to five times more than regular jet fuel. Things are even more complex in Africa. Prices increase further due to higher financing costs, as well as taxes, logistics and import costs. Waste-based SAF can cost twice as much as regular jet fuel, and synthetic fuels produced through carbon capture technologies can cost six to ten times as much.

The cost barrier isn’t just a money problem; it’s also a strategic one. African airlines that fly to other countries must follow rules that are becoming increasingly stringent regarding the reduction of carbon emissions. If you don’t do this, you may not be able to access profitable international routes and partnerships. This is not a threat that is far away; it is happening right now. Airlines that fail to prioritise SAF could fall behind as the world transitions to more environmentally friendly flying.

The untapped potential of Africa

The good news is that Africa is not without chances. Several countries are well-positioned to produce SAF by utilising local feedstocks and other agricultural resources they already possess.

South Africa could produce between 3.2 and 4.5 billion litres of biofuels annually from leftover sugarcane and biomass from invasive plants. This potential could turn South Africa into a regional SAF hub, serving both the domestic and international aviation markets.

Kenya aims to increase its SAF blend to 10% by 2030, positioning it as a leader in sustainable aviation in East Africa. Ethiopia and Nigeria are exploring pilot projects that utilise local feedstocks to incorporate SAF into their national aviation plans.

Africa has an advantage because it has a significant amount of biomass and can produce SAF with minimal adverse environmental impacts. Unlike regions that rely heavily on energy-intensive synthetic fuels, Africa can produce SAF from materials that are already available, often considered waste, thereby reducing both carbon emissions and production costs.

The function of policy and funding

Potential by itself is not enough. SAF projects require funding – and borrowing money in Africa costs approximately 30% more than it does in other parts of the world. This makes SAF less appealing to investors from a financial perspective. Private sector initiatives may fail to grow if there are no policies in place to support them.

SAF projects require funding – and borrowing money in Africa costs approximately 30% more than it does in other parts of the world.

This is where carbon markets and public private partnerships (PPPs) play a crucial role. Carbon credits from using SAF can help offset production costs, making it more appealing for both investors and airlines to get involved. There are also international climate finance programmes, such as the Green Climate Fund or the World Bank’s sustainability initiatives, that can help you secure funding.

Policymakers can also utilise tax breaks, subsidies and blending mandates to encourage people to produce and utilise SAF. Governments show that SAF is a priority by making clear rules for both domestic and international stakeholders. This is more than just an environmental policy; it’s an economic strategy. Countries that act quickly can become SAF leaders in their region.

Suggestions for strategy

What should Africa do next? The plan needs to be phased, thought out and realistic:

Start small: Begin with pilot projects using low percentage SAF blends to assess their effectiveness and refine the production process.

Utilise local feedstocks: Utilise inexpensive, abundant materials such as agricultural waste, sugarcane byproducts, and invasive plant species.

Invest in infrastructure: Build refineries, storage facilities and distribution networks that can effectively handle SAF.

Engage carbon markets: Utilise carbon credits to generate revenue from reducing emissions and make SAF more competitive.

Encourage international co-operation: Collaborate with airlines, investors and technical experts to exchange information and secure funding.

Following these steps will help Africa slowly adopt SAF, making it a scalable and profitable option.

Why Africa needs to act now

Time is running out. The aviation industry is working hard to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Airlines that don’t use SAF could lose access to international routes, partnerships and revenue streams.

For Africa, acting early has many advantages:

Environmental leadership: By reducing carbon emissions, Africa is taking an active role in global efforts to protect the environment.

Economic opportunity: Building SAF infrastructure can create jobs, boost local economies, and set up a supply chain in the area.

Strategic advantage: Countries that start producing SAF can sell it to international airlines, which will generate revenue and establish them as key partners in green aviation.

Africa’s unique strengths, including its large biomass reserves, relatively untapped resources, and growing aviation market, mean that the continent could set a new standard for sustainable aviation.

Conclusion

For Africa, sustainable aviation fuel presents both opportunities and challenges. It’s challenging to obtain money, and the cost of production is high. Africa can turn these problems into competitive advantages however, with careful planning, effective policies, and collaboration with other countries.

African countries can not only make their skies greener, but they can also become leaders in the global SAF market by starting small, utilising local resources, and incorporating carbon markets into the mix. It won’t be easy to get there. It will take money, vision and determination. But for Africa, the sky isn’t the limit; it’s the opportunity.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2412643141.png,N,,2025-11-05 03:16:38.692817
