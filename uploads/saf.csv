With the stock up strongly this year and trading just below analyst targets, is Safran undervalued given its innovation in sustainable aviation, or is the market already factoring in its future growth potential?

Most Popular Narrative: 12% Undervalued

Safran’s widely followed narrative points to a fair value above its last close price, reflecting strategic optimism about future growth and margin resilience. With analysts factoring in upcoming catalysts and robust sector tailwinds, the current share price appears to lag their broader outlook.

The recent acquisition of Collins' actuation and flight control assets, along with other targeted acquisitions and strategic partnerships, will broaden Safran's mission-critical offering, drive cost synergies through 2028, and further diversify revenue streams. This is expected to result in higher EBIT margins and more stable earnings.

Want to know which bold strategy shifts are behind this valuation? The forecast depends on major boosts to free cash flow, new tech bets, and a game-changing margin play. Discover how all the pieces fit together in the full breakdown and see which financial projections hold the key.

Result: Fair Value of €328.67 (UNDERVALUED)

However, ongoing supply chain pressures and significant integration challenges from recent acquisitions could still threaten Safran’s projected earnings momentum and valuation upside.

Another View: Multiple Approach Challenges the Outlook

Taking a look through the lens of the price-to-earnings ratio, Safran appears well-priced compared to both its direct peers and the industry average. However, it trades above its fair ratio (27.9x vs 27x). This small premium suggests there could be less upside left than the growth narrative implies. Is the current optimism already priced in, or is there still room for a surprise?

According to Ghodawat, the airline operates 56 daily flights, with 65% of these falling under the UDAN scheme. “Today we have 56 daily flights, with 65% being UDAN, in our network of 31 cities,” he said.

The Bengaluru-based carrier has four 50-seat ERJ-145s and seven E175s. These jets began arriving on lease in 2023 in a two-class configuration (12+64), but in 2025 four aircraft with 88 seats in a single class were received.

However, Ghodawat did not specify which aircraft are being evaluated at Embraer. Besides the already operated E175s, other alternatives include the E190-E2 for approximately 110 passengers, and the E195-E2, with up to 146 seats.

The E2 models, however, are more expensive, although they offer a lower operating cost per seat. Embraer has not yet secured an order from Indian airlines, a situation that Star Air could also take advantage of.

Star Air recently completed the first tranche of a funding round. The company has outlined plans to develop proprietary facilities for maintenance, repair, and crew training to support its growth trajectory.

Thirty Eighth Report

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill

1. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill was brought to the House of Lords on 20 October 2025. Second reading was on 20 November and Committee Stage is scheduled to begin on 10 December.

2.Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”) is a lower carbon aviation fuel and the Government considers its use to be “one of the most effective ways to reduce aviation emissions right now”. However, in the Government’s view a number of risks discourage investment and hinder the development of a market in SAF production. One of these perceived risks is revenue uncertainty risk.

3.The Bill is intended to establish a revenue certainty mechanism to support SAF production and long-term investment in the United Kingdom. The Bill will enable the Secretary of State to designate a contractual counterparty, wholly owned by Government, and direct it to enter into contracts with producers that guarantee a price for their SAF over a set period; under the contracts the counterparty will pay producers the difference between the market price and a guaranteed “strike price” (if the strike price is higher) or receive the difference from the producer (if the strike price if lower). A levy on suppliers of aviation fuel will fund the mechanism and its administration.

4.The Department for Transport has provided a Delegated Powers Memorandum (“the Memorandum”) explaining and justifying the Bill’s delegated powers. The Bill includes twelve delegated powers two of which, in clauses 1(8) and 11(4)(a), are Henry VIII powers. Both of these appear to be justified and comply with our frequently cited presumption that such powers should be subject to affirmative procedure unless there is compelling justification to the contrary. However we are disappointed that the Memorandum does not acknowledge that the Bill includes Henry VIII powers. Our Guidance for Departments requires that such powers are clearly identified.

5.This note draws the House’s attention to one delegated power.

Clause 11(4)(b)–determination of turnover

6.The Bill confers delegated powers to raise and dispose of levy funding. Exercise of these powers will necessarily involve imposing statutory duties on suppliers of aviation fuel. Clause 11(1) confers a power on the Secretary of State to enforce these duties by imposing a financial penalty on suppliers who are in breach. The maximum amount of the penalty appears on the face of the Bill in clause 11(3) as the lesser of:

£100,000, and

an amount equal to 10% of turnover of the person on whom it is imposed.

7.Clause 11(4) is a delegated power that allows regulations to be made:

(a)amending the figure of £100, 000 in the light of inflation, and

(b)setting out how turnover is to be determined.

8.Regulations exercising the power in (a) are subject to affirmative provision and those exercising the power in (b) are subject to negative procedure.

9.We have consistently taken the view that the maximum amount of any financial penalty should be set out on the face of a Bill with, where necessary, a delegated power subject to affirmative procedure to vary that amount. The approach taken by the Government to clause 11(4)(a) accords with this principle.

10.It also seems reasonable in our view for the Government to seek the delegated power in clause 11(4)(b) to set out how turnover is to be determined since doing so is likely to involve technical detail and will involve judgments about fair treatment of those subject to the levy. However, clause 11(4)(b) is of at least equal significance to 11(4)(a) in setting the maximum amount of any financial penalty so it appears to us inconsistent that its exercise is subject to negative procedure.

11.In our report on the Online Safety Bill, we discussed a power to set the definition of “qualifying worldwide revenue” which term was used in that Bill as “turnover” is in this: to partially determine the maximum level of financial penalty for breach of statutory duty. We concluded, noting precedent in the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022, that the definition should be set in regulations subject to affirmative procedure because it went to the “highly significant matter of the level of financial penalties”. The close similarity to setting out how turnover is to be determined in setting a maximum financial penalty is in our view clear.

12.The Memorandum does not seek to justify the use of negative procedure for exercise of the power in clause 11(4)(b). It is concerning that instead it wrongly suggests that the power to set how turnover is determined is subject to affirmative procedure.",,N,,2025-11-27 15:56:42.037657

On November 26th, 2025, Salvador International Airport tornou-se o primeiro do Brasil a abastecer voos comerciais com sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) provided by Vibra Energy. A operação inaugural representa um marco inédito para a aviação brasileira e um avanço significativo na agenda de decarbonization of air transport. A iniciativa envolve rotas regulares operadas com uma mistura de 10% de SAF e 90% de querosene tradicional, já sendo aplicada nos voos diários para Brasília e São Paulo.

Por que o SAF representa um avanço imediato para o Brasil

De acordo com as informações divulgadas pela empresa e pelo governo da Bahia, o uso do combustível sustentável pode reduzir até 80% of greenhouse gas emissions ao longo do ciclo de vida do produto. Além disso, a prestação desse serviço coloca Salvador como referência nacional ao se tornar o primeiro aeroporto brasileiro a ter um fornecimento constante de SAF para voos comerciais.

O uso do SAF é considerado hoje a forma mais rápida e prática de reduzir as emissões da aviação comercial. Isso ocorre porque o combustível sustentável pode ser utilizado em aeronaves convencionais sem exigir qualquer modificação técnica ou substituição de infraestrutura aeroportuária. Esse aspecto torna o combustível um aliado estratégico para acelerar a transição energética do setor aéreo.

O SAF fornecido pela Vibra Energy é produzido a partir de resíduos renováveis, como óleos usados, gorduras residuais e restos da agroindústria. Por utilizar materiais de baixo impacto ambiental, o ciclo de vida do produto emite menos carbono, o que resulta na redução significativa de gases de efeito estufa ao ser comparado ao querosene fóssil.

A certificação internacional aplicada ao combustível assegura rastreabilidade e comprovação de sustentabilidade. Isso significa que a origem da matéria-prima, o processo de produção e o transporte são verificados por entidades independentes, garantindo credibilidade aos resultados ambientais apresentados.

Operação diária no Aeroporto de Salvador com combustível sustentável

A operação inaugurada no Aeroporto de Salvador não se limita a voos simbólicos ou experimentais. Em vez disso, estabelece um padrão diário, com dois voos abastecidos regularmente com a mistura de 10% de SAF. Essa constância demonstra que o mercado brasileiro está preparado para integrar o combustível sustentável à rotina operacional da aviação.

O fornecimento inicial previsto para a fase de implementação chega a alguns milhões de litros, destinados exclusivamente para as rotas que partem da capital baiana. Isso demonstra que há planejamento de longo prazo, e não apenas projetos pontuais.

A Vibra Energy, que é responsável por abastecer mais de 90 aeroportos no país, estruturou sua cadeia logística para garantir o fornecimento contínuo do combustível sustentável. Como a empresa foi a primeira a disponibilizar SAF comercialmente no Brasil, Salvador se tornou o local ideal para iniciar a operação regular.

A companhia também avança em negociações para expandir a oferta de SAF para outros estados e aeroportos. Caso esse processo evolua, Salvador pode se transformar em um polo nacional de abastecimento sustentável, incentivando a expansão da aviação verde no país.

Impactos ambientais do combustível sustentável (SAF)

O impacto ambiental do SAF é a principal razão para sua adoção global. Mesmo com apenas 10% de mistura, há uma redução perceptível nas emissões de carbono. Quando utilizado em proporções maiores — o que é tecnicamente possível — o benefício se torna ainda mais expressivo, aproximando a aviação das metas globais estabelecidas por organismos internacionais.

Estudos indicam que o combustível sustentável pode reduzir até 80% das emissões de CO₂, dependendo da matéria-prima utilizada no processo produtivo. Essa redução considera todo o ciclo de vida do produto, desde a produção até a queima nos motores.

Para Salvador, a operação cria oportunidades de desenvolvimento econômico e ambiental. A cidade já é reconhecida como um polo turístico e logístico, e agora reforça o seu papel estratégico em iniciativas de inovação e sustentabilidade.

Para o Brasil, a iniciativa representa um avanço alinhado às metas de redução de emissões assumidas internacionalmente. A aviação é um setor conhecido por sua dificuldade de descarbonização, e o SAF desponta como a alternativa mais eficaz no curto e médio prazo.

Aeroporto de Salvador como referência nacional em aviação sustentável

Ao inaugurar essa operação, o Aeroporto Internacional de Salvador se posiciona como pioneiro no país e reforça sua relevância no cenário nacional. A iniciativa soma-se a projetos que já vinham sendo implementados no terminal, incluindo sistemas de eficiência energética, modernização da infraestrutura e práticas sustentáveis de gestão.

Ser o primeiro aeroporto brasileiro a oferecer abastecimento regular com combustível sustentável é mais do que um título simbólico — é um reconhecimento da capacidade técnica, da articulação institucional e do compromisso com a agenda climática.

Com a operação já em curso, outros aeroportos podem observar o modelo adotado em Salvador para replicá-lo em suas estruturas. A experiência prática facilitará a elaboração de políticas públicas, ajustes regulatórios e incentivos fiscais que favoreçam o uso do SAF em todo o país.

À medida que a oferta e a demanda crescem, o custo tende a diminuir, tornando o combustível sustentável mais competitivo e ampliando seu uso no setor aéreo.

Desafios para o avanço do SAF no país

Apesar dos benefícios ambientais, a ampliação do uso do SAF enfrenta desafios. O principal deles é o custo de produção, que ainda é superior ao do querosene convencional. Como o mercado brasileiro está em fase inicial, o volume disponível também é limitado.

Outro ponto relevante é a necessidade de políticas públicas específicas, capazes de estimular a produção nacional e reduzir a dependência de importações. Incentivos tributários, financiamentos e parcerias entre empresas e governos são fundamentais para impulsionar a cadeia produtiva.

A operação em Salvador, contudo, mostra que mesmo com os desafios, é possível estruturar um modelo viável e tecnicamente seguro.

A relevância do uso de SAF para o futuro da aviação brasileira

A operação iniciada no Aeroporto Internacional de Salvador representa um marco decisivo para o setor aéreo. O uso do SAF fornece benefícios ambientais comprovados, reforça a competitividade do país no cenário internacional e demonstra que a transição energética na aviação já está em andamento.

Ao adotar o combustível sustentável de forma regular, Salvador estabelece uma referência para todo o território nacional. A iniciativa demonstra que a inovação ambiental pode caminhar ao lado da operação comercial, mantendo a segurança, a eficiência e a regularidade dos voos.

b. Equinor – deployment of autonomous robotics systems across all refinery sites in Norway

Equinor’s innovation team in Norway has successfully deployed autonomous robotics systems to conduct routine tasks such as monitoring and inspection. The robots use onboard sensors to conduct acoustic, visual and leak detection while also allowing for collection of routine sample points and taking them to a non-hazardous location for testing. The main purpose of the project is to remove personnel from being exposed to hazards in process areas during these routine tasks.

The innovation of this project is not just in the utilisation of robots, but the process Equinor went through, along with it project partners, for determining the suitability of non-ATEX certified or assessed robots to be used in Zone 2 areas. Equinor identified that due to gaps in the current methodologies used for certification of systems for use in hazardous areas, it is not always clear how to apply hazardous area requirements to these systems but also that existing certifications may have gaps to be able to determine that all ignition risks have been defined and managed to acceptable levels. This approach has satisfied equivalence to certification and satisfied all Equinor’s procedural requirements for deployment of equipment in hazardous areas, as with any other devices. Equinor is now supporting DNV in spearheading a Joint Industry Project with multiple operators and robotics companies to develop a recommended practice for assessment of robotics systems for use in hazardous areas.

The energy major said increasing low-sulphur diesel production at Fawley by 40 percent should reduce imports into Britain by a quarter while helping to meet demand from sectors including heavy transport, emergency response, agriculture and industry. The project also involved the construction, completion, and commissioning of a Steam Methane Reforming Hydrogen Plant. The new hydrogen plant builds on over 50 years of experience with hydrogen production onsite and could enable the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as the energy transition evolves.

d. INEOS – £30 million investment at Hull manufacturing site to cut emissions by 75%

INEOS has completed a major £30 million investment at its Hull manufacturing site, converting the facility to run on clean-burning hydrogen instead of natural gas. The result is a 75% cut in carbon emissions – the equivalent of taking around 160,000 petrol cars off the road and a huge step towards INEOS’ net zero commitment, well ahead of 2050, the company says. This investment will deliver a transformational step change improvement in the site’s product carbon footprint, INEOS said. The hydrogen used at the site is produced as a co-product from existing manufacturing processes, a model which INEOS believes can be replicated across the industry.

e. Nuclear Decommissioning Authority – use of Spot the robot ""dog"" to reactivate equipment at Dounreay nuclear site

Spot, the robot ""dog,"" assisted personnel in Dounreay’s Fuel Cycle Area by reactivating a crucial building crane in a reprocessing plant. The crane had been deactivated at the switchboard in 2023 due to concerns about the ageing asset at the nuclear site. Safety restrictions prohibited human interaction with the switchboard, which further delayed its reactivation. However, the facility required the crane for waste shipment and for ongoing decommissioning efforts. Following consultations with NRS, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, it was decided to use Spot for the task. As the site’s Spot was not equipped with an “arm” handling device, the team asked the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Collaboration (RAICo) for support. After conducting a week of trials on a non-live switch mock-up in a nearby substation storeroom, Spot used a gripped pole to flip the switch, successfully restoring power to the crane.

Announced on 26 November 2025, the project is part of the EU-funded A4Climate initiative, which aims to provide practical tools and technologies to curb aviation’s environmental footprint. By flying behind TUIfly aircraft in real operating conditions, DLR scientists can directly measure the characteristics of contrails—the thin white streaks that form in cold, humid air at cruising altitude.

Contrails and the cirrus clouds they can develop into are among aviation’s largest climate-warming factors. Yet their formation depends on multiple variables, including engine type, fuel composition, altitude, and atmospheric conditions. The new campaign is designed to help untangle these influences.

Using specialised onboard instruments, the DLR research aircraft will analyse exhaust particles, ice crystals, temperature and humidity levels, and how different engine technologies behave in real time. The data will ultimately feed into models that could shape future aircraft design and airline operations.

According to TUI and DLR, the findings may support new engine concepts, alternative fuels, and climate-optimised flight routes—for example, avoiding areas of the atmosphere where contrails are most likely to persist and warm the planet.

The partners describe the project as an important step toward identifying concrete, scalable solutions for more climate-efficient flying.

When quantifying and discussing this climate impact, ongoing academic and societal discussions of how to define successful climate change mitigation for aviation must be considered (see Aviation climate targets, below).
We also reviewed related aspects in previous works which discuss aviation climate mitigation pathways (Table 1).
Aviation climate targets Achieving so-called ‘climate-neutral’ or ‘net-zero’ aviation by 2050 are recurring concepts without a universal definition.
For use on hydrogen aircraft, hydrogen is liquefied after distribution82.","The air transport sector has become a linchpin of the global economy, but it is also a large contributor to environmental degradation, including climate change1,2. The climate change mitigation required to limit global warming to well below 2 °C, following the Paris Agreement3, is commonly interpreted as reducing greenhouse gas emissions to ‘net zero’ by 2050. In a net-zero scenario, any greenhouse gases emitted through human activities must be ‘offset’, i.e., balanced by an equivalent reduction of greenhouse gases. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is among industry organisations making a voluntary net-zero commitment, with a considerable reliance on offsetting4. Furthermore, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is demonstrating the practical implementation of a climate change mitigation framework through the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)5. This scheme aims to offset carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from international aviation in excess of a yearly limit, currently defined as 85% of such emissions in 2019. Coverage of climate forcers other than CO2 and lifecycle phases beyond the combustion phase is limited6. CORSIA maintains eligibility criteria aligned with its (limited) scope7, yet the legitimacy of offsetting as an effective climate mitigation tool is challenged by the abundance of low-quality efforts where offset sales do not result in the promised reduction of atmospheric greenhouse gases8,9,10. Broadly, the value of offsets in long-term impact reduction is debatable11,12. As such, the reliance on offsetting and the focus on CO2 at the expense of other climate forcers limits the suitability of these targets to the Paris Agreement.

In addition to offsetting, aviation industry roadmaps focus on measures centred around energy efficiency and substituting fossil kerosene with alternative aviation fuels (AAF)13,14,15,16. Industry actors have set ambitious non-binding targets for these two measures in past decades, but these targets have not been met17. In contrast to these voluntary targets, the European Union (EU) formalised legal requirements in 2023, under the so-called ReFuelEU Aviation initivative18. Following this regulation, EU airports must meet a minimum share of AAF in the fuel they supply, increasing from 2% in 2025 to 70% in 2050. This minimum can be met with sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), defined in the EU as drop-in fuels which meet certain sustainability requirements, or with select non-drop-in alternatives to fossil kerosene. Still, the development of AAF infrastructure faces logistical and technological challenges. Currently, most production methods are based on biomass feedstocks19, but the scale at which these feedstocks can be supplied sustainably is limited20. Therefore, there is great interest in fuels that do not rely on biomass. Hydrogen (H2) can be such a low-impact fuel if obtained from water electrolysis powered by renewable energy21. However, the relatively low volumetric energy density of hydrogen, even in liquid form, presents a challenge for aviation22,23. New technologies are needed to adapt aircraft accordingly, with the market entry of narrow-body hydrogen-powered aircraft expected for 203524. Hydrogen can also be used to produce synthetic drop-in fuels by combining it with a carbon source. This source can come from industrial flue gas, resulting in the delayed emission of fossil carbon, or from biomass or the direct air capture (DAC) of atmospheric CO225,26.

We do not yet know how the adoption of ReFuelEU Aviation will influence the climate impact of future aviation, nor how this future will compare to other targets for climate mitigation. The mitigation of aviation’s climate impacts has been addressed in multiple recent studies27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37, but these cannot necessarily be extrapolated to this context. First, the European scope matters. Understanding that access to aviation is distributed highly unequally38, we argue that a just transition towards sustainable aviation should be understood differently across regions. To illustrate, Åkerman et al.27 present a scenario where, within their definition of successful climate mitigation, per capita air travel is around 3000 km in 2060. Compared to the levels before the COVID-19 pandemic, this represents a tripling of global air travel, yet at the same time almost halving it for the Swedish population27. Assuming that commercial aviation will evolve differently across regions, we avoid describing the sector in terms of global trends.

Second, the analysis of mitigation pathways is inherently tied to how these pathways are conceptualised and understood. For example, we assume that the introduction of AAF—including the potential deployment hydrogen-powered aircraft—is driven by ReFuelEU, with additional measures to eliminate the use of fossil kerosene by 2060. Other studies consider different logic for the deployment of AAF (see Table 1 in Methods) and further mitigation measures. Here, we focus on AAFs, air traffic volumes, and aircraft technology. We do not consider contrail avoidance, although it could be a viable mitigation strategy39. Following the challenges introduced above, we exclude carbon storage and other offsetting techniques, despite their prominence in sectoral roadmaps (see also Discussion). Beyond technical and social dimensions, coverage of environmental dimensions varies too. CO2 is a common focus of aviation climate targets, thereby neglecting other climate forcers. Simultaneously, climate forcers such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and persistent contrails stemming from aviation have a relatively short-lived effect, which presents a challenge to conventional climate metrics when trying to compare the impact of mitigation scenarios40. As a result, the use of climate metrics for aviation is the subject of active scientific debate41,42. To circumvent this challenge, we compare climate forcers in terms of warming equivalence and introduce two complementary criteria for successful climate change mitigation. First, we assess the ambition to achieve net-zero targets by 2050 by evaluating whether aviation’s contribution to temperature change increases from 2050 to 2070. Second, we use sectoral emission limits to evaluate a proxy warming budget for the coming decades. This allows for a comprehensive discussion of climate impacts, although introducing additional assumptions and limitations (see Discussion and Methods). However, considering impacts from diverse emissions is not sufficient when important sources of such emissions are excluded. Concerning aviation, simplifications which leave out the production phase of fossil kerosene or the use phase of alternative fuels are common29,43, yet such assumptions prevent both a consistent comparison between fuels and a holistic assessment of the sector44. To address this, our analysis integrates a forward-looking approach called prospective lifecycle assessment (pLCA)45,46,47. Such a method enables, for example, the conclusion that the synthesis of synthetic fuels must be powered by a low-carbon energy system in order for the fuel’s climate impacts to be below that of fossil kerosene29,48,49.

With these considerations accounted for, our analysis has a consistent coverage of the aviation system and its resulting climate impact. We describe future European aviation across various socio-technical scenarios, quantifying its evolution and climate impacts by integrating pLCA with a stock-and-flow model. Our analysis includes diverse projections for aircraft technology and air traffic volume. We compare hydrogen-powered aircraft with hydrogen used for drop-in synthetic fuels. In doing so, we deliberately exclude bio-based AAF. This is a deviation from commonly envisioned futures, but has a limited influence on the discussion of overall climate impacts. From this comparison, we observe that per unit air travel, e-fuel uses more hydrogen and has a higher overall impact than hydrogen-powered aircraft. Thereby, fulfilling ReFuelEU in part with hydrogen-powered aircraft results in reductions of yearly hydrogen consumption (13-26%) and CO2 emissions (23-32%), as well as temperature change in 2070 (13–16%). With or without hydrogen-powered aircraft, we find that most scenarios meet our definition of climate neutrality when replacing all fossil kerosene by 2060. However, we are hesitant to qualify this as successful climate mitigation: the target set for CO2 emissions is frequently exceeded and climate neutrality is highly sensitive to our assumptions surrounding non-CO2 impacts. We conclude that, in order to limit the climate impact of European aviation, additional measures must join ReFuelEU and limit the near-term use of fossil fuels. When faced with limits to the pace of decarbonisation, we recommend that such measures focus on demand management.

We developed a dynamic system model to estimate possible futures for European aviation. A stock-and-flow model generates fleets of aircraft and fuel infrastructure in order to meet the imposed air traffic volumes (Fig. 1a). Characteristics of the aircraft and fuels introduced are governed by two additional scenario parameters: the advancement of aircraft technology and the evolution of AAF use. The resulting flows are used to scale technology-level LCA data, covering both direct aircraft emissions and emissions across the lifecycles of aircraft and fuel infrastructure. Figure 1 provides an overview of the key parameters, parameter values, and the system boundary. We briefly elaborate on this in the following paragraphs. Detailed descriptions are given the corresponding parts of the Methods section.

Our definition of European aviation covers departures of scheduled passenger flights from select countries in Europe. We model flights for 2024-2070 by scaling the air traffic patterns of 2019 according to high-level forecasts. We combine EUROCONTROL’s seven-year forecast (up to 2031)50 and the long-term forecast (up to 2050)51. We assume that the long-term year-on-year growth remain representative until 2070, i.e., ‘low growth’ of 0.7%, ‘base growth’ of 1.6%, and ‘high growth’ of 2.2%. Following public support for suppression of commercial aviation as a climate mitigation strategy52,53,54, we also considered an additional ‘degrowth’ trajectory, in which air traffic from 2035 onwards remains constant at 70% of the 2019 demand (Fig. 1b).

Technological improvements in aircraft efficiency vary from a business-as-usual scenario, with progress following historic trends55, to scenarios that include substantial improvements, from ‘optimistic’ expert estimates30, to speculative ‘breakthrough’ advances55. Future hydrogen-powered aircraft are correlated to these general trends, having a lower efficiency under business as usual and a higher efficiency under breakthrough. The latest aircraft generation we include is introduced in 2050, which is why we do not forecast beyond 2070. The fuel supply follows the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, aiming to reduce fossil kerosene to 30% of the fuel supply by 2050. Although ReFuelEU does not extend past 2050, we consider an extended version of ReFeulEU, in which additional measures lead to the elimination of fossil kerosene by 2060 (Fig. 1c). In our scenarios, the alternatives to fossil kerosene are drop-in e-fuel and non-drop-in liquid hydrogen. Both alternative fuels are produced from electricity, modelled after a grid with a highly ambitious transition towards renewable energy.

Future scenarios

In order to effectively discuss possible futures, the scenario space is reduced from all possible combinations of scenario parameters to a few distinct sets, following principles of compatibility and distinctiveness, as demonstrated by, e.g., Delpierre et al.56 and Langkau et al.57. First, we consider the compatibility of the technology and demand scenario parameters. Transportation efficiency improvement is considered to stimulate demand, limiting its effectiveness as a climate change mitigation measure58. However, experts disagree on how introducing novel aircraft and fuel technologies interacts with measures to limit air traffic growth. Some argue that, with projected growth, the energy demand of aviation could become incompatible with the available energy resources29,36. Others argue that the higher cost associated with AAF will somewhat slow growth but that further limitations would delay the sector’s sustainability transition by diverting financial resources13,14. At least in some European countries, there appears to be public support to increase barriers to flight52,53,54, although political uptake is limited59,60. Based on these perspectives, we decide to positively correlate air traffic demand with the development of aircraft technology, leading to three technology-demand pairs (Fig. 1a). This correlation can be described narratively as follows: ‘In a high-growth scenario, the fuel efficiency imperative of the aviation sector enabled it to maintain its substantial growth, which in turn provided space for revolutionary aircraft technologies to mature. In combination with broad public support, this enabled the construction of AAF infrastructure at rates thought impossible. Conversely, in a degrowth scenario, the aviation sector lacked financial resources, which reinforced the slow development of AAF infrastructure and halted technological breakthroughs. Limited access to clean technology, in turn, limited the air traffic that could be achieved within stringent environmental regulations, further restricting available resources.’ This correlation is introduced in order to effectively explore the scenario space and not to imply a preference over alternative narratives.

Nine scenarios are selected by combining the three sets of demand-technology pairs with three distinct fuel mix scenario values (Fig. 1a). These fuel mixes consist of (1) a baseline, where the share of AAF is not increased, (2) the implementation of an extended version of ReFuelEU Aviation (Fig. 1c), but with no commercial introduction of hydrogen-powered aircraft, meaning that all AAF is modelled as e-fuel, and (3) the extended version of ReFuelEU Aviation, also featuring commercial hydrogen-powered aircraft in future generations, meaning that the share of AAF is met through a combination of liquid hydrogen and e-fuel.

Aircraft fleets

Future aircraft generations are introduced into the fleet with a bottom-up stock-and-flow model: each year, aircraft past retirement (which we assume to be after 22 years of use) are removed from the fleet and—to the extent that additional aircraft are needed in order to meet the current air traffic demand—aircraft from the latest generation are added. This creates an interaction between air traffic demand and the introduction of new technology. In a scenario with consistent high growth, a new generation increases its share of the fleet more rapidly than in a scenario with consistent slow growth—compare the introduction of the 2050 generation (gen. 3) in Fig. 2b and Fig. 2d.

In scenarios which start with a strong decline in air traffic, few new aircraft are required during this period. Once these aircraft need replacing, 22 years after the decline started, we see that once again few new aircraft are introduced—observe the period around 2050 in Fig. 2e, leading to a small share of the 2050 generation in 2055 (Fig. 2f). Conversely, however, the aircraft retiring in the years following the decline were already in the fleet before the decline started. As the overall fleet shrunk, the retirement of this segment represents the turnover of a sizeable portion of the fleet as a whole. This results in the periods of slow replacement being alternated with periods or rapid replacement, to the extent that the share of the 2035 generation (gen. 2) initially increases the fastest for the degrowth scenarios (compare 2040 in Fig. 2b, d to the same year in Fig. 2f). Of course, the simplifications we make mean that such a pronounced ripple effect is not necessarily representative of reality, but this illustrates a possible consequence of prolonged shifts in the air traffic demand.

In scenarios featuring hydrogen-powered aircraft, these are introduced with consideration for the aircraft type and flight destination. We assume that the initial introduction of hydrogen-powered aircraft is limited to intra-European flights serviced by narrow-body aircraft—a segment which represents 48% of air traffic in terms of revenue passenger-kilometres (RPK) (see Table 2 in Methods). Because hydrogen-powered aircraft are introduced to the extent required to meet demand, only a fraction of European airports require hydrogen infrastructure in 2035. However, we do assume that this can extend to all European airports as time goes on, as well as some extra-European destinations after 2050 (see Table 3, as well as associated text, in Methods). With these ambitious assumptions, the share of air traffic powered by hydrogen rapidly grows from around 10% in 2040 to over 60% in 2070 (Fig. 2).

Fuel demand

Figure 3 illustrates how different parameter combinations affect fuel use and hydrogen demand. In the baseline scenarios—where AAF is not scaled up—total fuel demand initially diverges but then stabilises around 2035 with the introduction of future aircraft (Fig. 3a). This shows that demand plays a substantial role in the short term, while the contrast in fuel efficiency of aircraft technology becomes more influential over time. The business-as-usual scenario stabilises fuel use with 0% demand growth, while the breakthrough scenario stabilises fuel use with a year-on-year growth of 2.2%.

In the scenarios following our extended version of ReFuelEU, the required AAF share (Fig. 1c) is achieved by introducing hydrogen-powered aircraft and by replacing fossil kerosene by e-fuel. The combined AAF used across scenarios with or without hydrogen-powered aircraft is therefore similar (Fig. 3b), with some divergence emerging due to differences in the energy demand for hydrogen-powered and hydrocarbon-powered aircraft. Hydrogen-powered aircraft could require less energy per available seat-kilometre (ASK) than their contemporary hydrocarbon-powered counterparts (see Methods). This is why the introduction of hydrogen-powered aircraft reduces the total demand for aviation fuel when assuming breakthrough future technology. In optimistic and business-as-usual scenarios, this is not the case, and introducing hydrogen aircraft increases the total fuel demand. Since ReFuelEU defines a share of AAF, such changes to the total fuel demand influence how much fossil kerosene can be used (Fig. 3a).

Because the initial fleet composition is identical across scenarios, the number of aircraft reaching their retirement age is also the same up to 2046. When combined with the differing energy demands of hydrogen-powered aircraft, this leads to similar use of hydrogen as AAF in 2035-2046 across scenarios (see the desaturated lines in Fig. 3b). Consequently, hydrogen makes up over 50% of the 2042 AAF supply in the degrowth scenario, with a temporary peak of 70% in 2045, while in the high-growth scenario it first exceeds 50% in 2056. This illustrates how future aircraft efficiencies, fleet compositions, and the incentives set for AAF use are all closely related in determining how the sector takes shape.

The total hydrogen required across scenarios also relates to aircraft energy efficiency. However, another dimension to consider here is the efficiency with which hydrogen is used to fuel aircraft. In the production of drop-in e-fuel, hydrogen is first used in a reverse water-gas shift reaction to obtain carbon monoxide (CO) from CO2, which is then combined with additional hydrogen in a Fischer-Tropsch reaction to obtain hydrocarbons. This leads to a consumption of 1.61 MJ hydrogen per 1 MJ of e-fuel. On the other hand, fuelling an aircraft with 1 MJ of liquid hydrogen requires only 1.02 MJ hydrogen, with minor losses in transportation and liquefaction steps (see Methods). As a result, the introduction of hydrogen aircraft always leads to a reduction in the overall hydrogen production required (Fig. 3c). Nonetheless, the hydrogen demand remains substantial across all scenarios. By 2050, hydrogen demand in aviation could exceed 20% of European production following a net-zero emissions pathway21 in both low-demand and high-demand scenarios.

Climate impacts of fuels

Environmental flows of climate forcing agents are added up across the aviation system, spanning the full lifecycle of fuels and aircraft. We use the computational framework of Smith et al.61 to express the combined impact of climate forcers as time-dependent warming-equivalent emissions, using aviation-specific parameters based on Arriolabengoa et al.42. These warming-equivalent emissions are multiplied by the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions62, thereby obtaining the aviation system’s contribution to temperature change (Fig. 4b). However, since contemporary climate targets often focus on CO2, we also consider yearly CO2 emissions (Fig. 4a) and their accumulation (Fig. 4b) in relation to sectoral targets. We further elaborate on the rationale and implementation of these choices in their corresponding parts of the Methods section.

Initially, the CO2 emissions from fossil-powered scenarios are comparable to those of AAF-powered scenarios (Fig. 4a). In fact, the CO2 emitted per RPK slightly increases initially (Supplementary Fig. 4c), given the high impact of an AAF value chain which still makes considerable use of fossil energy (Supplementary Fig. 5). As the energy mix rapidly transitions to renewable sources and the AAF share increases, AAF-powered scenarios begin to show substantial benefits, leading to a reduction in CO2 emissions and temperature change (Fig. 4).

AAF scenarios with hydrogen-powered aircraft emit 23-32% less CO2 annually than those without, but this reduction is modest compared to the reduction of roughly 80% relative to scenarios without ReFuelEU (Fig. 4a). Differences such as the diverging hydrogen demand (Fig. 3c) are limited in their influence on climate change, since we assume that AAF value chains are largely free of fossil resources by the time that hydrogen-powered aircraft enter the fleet. The difference in temperature change is more noticeable: we assume that a turbine burning hydrogen produces 90% less NOx emissions in cruise than one burning the same energy content in hydrocarbons63, leading to a distinct change in NOx impacts (Supplementary Fig. 6). However, such assumptions about the non-CO2 effects of AAF are highly uncertain (see Methods).

CO2 limit and air traffic volumes

We combine the ICAO and IATA targets mentioned earlier into a single annual CO2 limit (Fig. 4a), which does not consider other climate forcers (see Methods). This limit can be translated into a corresponding budget, equivalent to 2.4 Gton CO2 or a temperature change of 1.1 mK (Fig. 4b). Figure 4 shows that both the low-growth and high-growth scenarios consistently exceed the combined ICAO/IATA target, overshooting the budget in 2043 and 2038, respectively. In contrast, AAF-powered degrowth scenarios stay below the annual CO2 target for several decades, helping to offset the overshoot seen between 2045 and 2070 (Fig. 4a). As a result, the degrowth scenarios with and without hydrogen-powered aircraft reach the budget in 2067 and after 2070, respectively. Additional representations of this limit for different scenarios can be found in Supplementary Fig. 6.

It is notable that the fossil-powered degrowth scenario exceeds the CO2 budget later (2050 versus 2038) and to a lesser degree (overshoot in 2070 of 1.3 versus 2.3–2.5 Gton CO2) than either of the AAF-powered high-growth scenarios. This is closely related to fossil kerosene use (compare Fig. 4a to Fig. 3a). As discussed above, the assumed differences in technological development can largely compensate for growth, but only beyond 2035, leading to these distinct differences in cumulative CO2 emissions. This highlights the crucial influence of future air traffic on the resulting impacts. This influence is even more prominent when considering non-CO2 effects, which we discuss in the following section.

Climate neutrality and non-CO2 effects

In addition to CO2, aviation affects the climate through emissions such as methane (CH4), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrogen (H2), and the formation of persistent contrails (see Methods). When considering these non-CO2 effects, the overall temperature change is much higher (Fig. 4b), mainly due to the inclusion of NOx and aviation-induced cloudiness (Supplementary Fig. 5). Although non-CO2 effects are still highly uncertain, we assume that their impact is lessened with the introduction of AAF63,64. In addition to the reduction of NOx emissions from hydrogen-powered aircraft, mentioned above, AAF could result in lower impacts from persistent contrails: soot particles act as condensation nuclei in contrail formation, and as synthetic fuels undergo cleaner combustion, less soot is emitted (see Methods). As a result, temperature change sees a (temporary) reduction in AAF-powered scenarios as the AAF share increases (compare Fig. 4b to Fig. 3c), reaching a relative minimum by 2060 (Fig. 4b). In the degrowth and low-growth scenarios, temperature change stabilises at this lower level, while in the high-growth scenario, it increases again as air traffic continues to rise.

To assess climate mitigation beyond the target of net-zero CO2 emissions, the temperature increase can be used to define ‘climate-neutral aviation by 2050’: if the temperature increase does not exceed its 2050 level in subsequent years, the system could be considered climate neutral29,32. From 2050 to 2070, temperature change reduces by 13–20% for the AAF-powered degrowth scenarios and by 11-18% for those with low growth. A high-growth scenario can stay 1% below its 2050 temperature change with hydrogen-powered aircraft; without hydrogen-powered aircraft, the temperature change in 2070 is 7% higher than in 2050. However, when discarding the assumption that AAF reduce contrail impacts, temperature change follows the traffic trajectory past 2050 (Supplementary Fig. 6). In this case, only the degrowth scenario with hydrogen-powered aircraft could be considered climate neutral (Supplementary Fig. 7).

Aside from the uncertainty of AAF non-CO2 impacts, the fact that climate neutrality as defined here can be achieved under any growth scenario, despite large differences in impact, suggests that this is not a robust measure of successful climate mitigation. Because this definition of climate neutrality defines success with respect to a future reference year, it neglects the harmful effect of emissions which occurred prior to this reference year. A more meaningful measure of success requires a budget-based target. The CO2 budget is an example of this, and appears here as though it could be a good indicator of success. However, because it excluded non-CO2 impacts, overshoots appear smaller than they actually are. If the CO2-based budget applied to aviation’s full climate impact in 2070, CO2 represents just 15-19% of the total overshoot (Supplementary Table 1)—except for AAF-powered degrowth scenarios, where this is less than 2% due to CO2 emissions remaining close to the budget.

We model the period 2024-2070 using a time resolution of one year. The sectoral model has a general workflow which starts by quantifying the air transport volume at each time step, depending on the traffic projection used. This feeds into a connected stock-and-flow model, creating persistent fleets of aircraft and fuel infrastructure to meet the required air transport and fuel supply. Time-explicit lifecycle inventories are generated and aggregated for the matching stocks and flows, creating timeseries of emissions. These time series are used to calculate warming-equivalent emissions, leading to a value for the change in temperature over time.

Modelling requirements and comparison to previous work

As outlined in the introduction, we conducted this work in order to understand the implications of ReFuelEU for the climate impact of European aviation. When quantifying and discussing this climate impact, ongoing academic and societal discussions of how to define successful climate change mitigation for aviation must be considered (see Aviation climate targets, below). For our assessment of the sector to be robust, it should consider diverse trends for air traffic demand and improvements to aircraft technology. Within these trends, it is relevant to consider the possibility of hydrogen-powered aircraft, given the European focus on hydrogen13,74. Based on these considerations, we formulated requirements for our modelling setup:

1.

A consistent trajectory for the AAF share, regardless of other factors. This is necessary in order to align the deployment of AAF with the requirements of ReFuelEU.

2.

A consistent system boundary and coverage of impacts. In order to address the impacts of flight from a lifecycle perspective, all energy carriers must be considered with a so-called well-to-wing system boundary, spanning from infrastructure and production to use of the fuel, with coverage of all related climate impacts without a priori assuming that a fuel has zero impact.

3.

A consideration for the role of air transport demand in the introduction of novel aircraft. This is necessary in order to understand the possible impact of fleet dynamics on the diffusion of future aircraft generations. For example, growing demand necessitates a growing fleet, with more new aircraft coming in than are being retired. Such behaviour can affect the rate at which new generations make up a given share of the total fleet.

4.

The inclusion of hydrogen-powered aircraft. The inclusion of such aircraft must, of course, also comply with the other requirements.

5.

An evaluation of climate mitigation which considers:

5.1

. An equivalent to goals which include the immediate future. Such goals do not focus (exclusively) on achieving a climate-neutral sector, but set targets for gradual climate mitigation.

5.2

. An equivalent to net-zero 2050 goals. With such goals, impacts are evaluated starting from a future year. This places the focus on an advanced state of the transition towards climate neutrality.

The details of how we implemented each of these requirements are given in the following sections. We also reviewed related aspects in previous works which discuss aviation climate mitigation pathways (Table 1). These articles provide insightful perspectives on the future of aviation’s impact on climate change, although none meet all of our requirements. This is natural, considering differences in research objective.

Aviation climate targets

Achieving so-called ‘climate-neutral’ or ‘net-zero’ aviation by 2050 are recurring concepts without a universal definition. Industry roadmaps are typically defined in terms of CO2 emitted during flight, with the only coverage of other climate impacts being AAF fuel production13,14. This approach neglects other activities supporting flight, as well as non-CO2 effects such as contrail formation. We consider the 2050 net-zero goal using what Sacchi et al. term ‘warming neutrality’, which ‘requires that the [radiative] forcing is stabilised at the 2050 level’29, considering all climate forcers associated with the aviation system. This definition is conceptually similar to the ‘Bronze’ standard for climate neutrality, defined by Brazzola et al.32. In other words, we consider commercial aviation to be climate neutral if the temperature change resulting from the sector does not increase past its 2050 level. We evaluate this by comparing the temperature change in 2050 and 2070, the end of our temporal scope.

In addition to the trend in warming beyond 2050, which the above definition considers, there is the question of what magnitude of warming the aviation sector should remain within. This is an emerging subject of discussion69 and cannot be fully operationalised within the scope of this study. As a proxy, we follow the reasoning of Kito et al.28, who created a CO2 budget based on the emission limits for CO2 of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The limits are based on the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). In short, this scheme, which currently extends to 2035, sets a yearly limit to emissions from international aviation, covering CO2 and a few other greenhouse gases6. In response to the disruptive effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, this yearly limit was adjusted to 85% of covered emissions in 20195. IATA has set the goal that, after 2035, this limit will be linearly reduced such that it reaches zero in 20504 (Fig. 1a). Using our model, we estimate 150 Mton CO2 emissions for 2019. We use this value to scale the yearly emission limit, rather than the 147 Mton CO2 reported by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency75. This yearly emission limit creates an equivalent warming limit (Fig. 1b). Since this limit is specific to CO2 emissions, it does not apply to other climate forcers.

System boundary

As described above, sectoral targets often do not adopt a consistent lifecycle perspective. Nevertheless, we attempt to amend this, using a so-called well-to-wing perspective for fossil fuel and AAF, which spans the cradle-to-grave construction, operation, and decommissioning of fuel production infrastructure in addition to fuel use (Supplementary Fig. 1). Additionally, the lifecycles of the aircraft structures are included, as their share in environmental impacts has been speculated to increase with the use of AAF76. Due to a lack of prospective data, airports and the construction of new fuel distribution infrastructure are excluded. These are known to make a small contribution to the climate change impact of the sector55. When considering the environment more broadly, their share becomes more prominent55,76, but this falls outside the scope of the present work.

Despite their prominent role in sectoral narratives, offsetting and negative carbon technologies are excluded from our analysis. As discussed in our introduction, we make this choice based on the inefficacy of past offsetting measures. Sacchi et al.29 include a detailed description of carbon capture and storage across various scenarios, illustrating that this shifts the climate burden to ‘excessive pressure on economic and natural resources’. Although our inventories allow the quantification of additional environmental impacts (Supplementary Fig. 9), we focus on climate change and do not quantify economic indicators but further discuss these limitations (see Discussion).

Impact mitigation measures relating to passenger occupancy rate and technological improvement of AAF infrastructure were assessed, but excluded from the main results due to their limited influence (Supplementary Fig. 10). Several other possible measures were not quantified here, including increased aircraft replacement rates, improved air traffic management, and the introduction of electric aircraft. However, this does not mean that these measures are unimportant.

European aviation and air transport demand

International agreements generally define the aviation emissions allocated to a particular region based on the flights departing from that region. This approach is used here as well. In the context of this research, ‘Europe’ is defined as a selection of countries closely aligned in their approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, being the EU, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which includes Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, and additionally, the United Kingdom. This geographical definition is adopted from the Destination 2050 report13. Note that the United Kingdom is not subject to ReFuelEU, but does have a similar approach to decarbonising aviation, setting targets for the AAF share of the fuel supply, with its target of 75% AAF in 205077 being comparable with ReFuelEU minimum of 70%.

The volume of air transport is estimated by processing flight data78 from 2019 and scaling this according to the demand for 2024-2070. To evaluate commercial aviation, the scope is limited to the most common types of flight, being passenger transport on scheduled flights. It can, therefore, be described in terms of RPK. As we approximate the sector as generic narrow-body and wide-body aircraft, the RPK for these generic aircraft is determined based on the movements of the most commonly used narrow-body and wide-body aircraft79. For both aircraft types, a number of flight segments are created (Table 2), which are used to generate aircraft fleets (see Fleet dynamics). Flights are divided into distance segments, each given a representative flight distance, used when modelling the segment’s flights (see Aircraft performance and aircraft product systems). Furthermore, separate segments are identified for intra-Europe or extra-Europe flights, using our definition of ‘Europe’, as this factor is considered in the introduction of hydrogen aircraft, shown in the last column of Table 2 (see Fleet dynamics). A generic seat occupancy of 80% is assumed. This value is in line with historic trends55 but below aspirational goals16. However, this does not influence the comparative assessment between scenarios. Seat occupancy was found to have a relatively limited impact on the overall results when compared to other variables (Supplementary Fig. 10).

The demand for 2024-2070 following the EUROCONTROL pathways (‘low growth’, ‘base growth’, and ‘high growth’) is determined by combining EUROCONTROL’s seven-year50 and 2050 forecasts51. For 2024-2031, the 2019 data is scaled according to the projections for en-route service unites. For 2032-2070, the projected growth rate in flight numbers is used; by scaling the 2019 data as a whole, we neglect the trend towards larger aircraft and further flight distances13. Our ‘degrowth’ pathway strongly deviates from any industry forecast. This pathway is based on a panel consultation of the Dutch population on achieving national climate targets54. Several of the options most widely chosen by participants involve the suppression of commercial aviation, aligning with public support in France and the United Kingdom to disincentivise air travel52,53. The authors report this as two measures: a ban on flights to destinations within 600 km and a reduction in the number of flights by 30%54. We, therefore, opt for a linear reduction in yearly RPK from 2024 to 2034, after which it stagnates at 70% of the 2019 value. No distinction is made among distance segments when applying these growth trajectories.

Fleet dynamics

There are several ways to represent the technological development of aircraft as a function of time. We use a dynamic stock-and-flow model representing long-lived capital goods, covering both aircraft and key AAF production infrastructure (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Fleets are formed by combining stocks that perform the same function, e.g., representing different generations of narrow-body aircraft. After defining an initial condition for each fleet, its composition changes at each time interval: units which pass their maximum age leave the fleet, after which enough units enter the fleet so that the fleet can meet its required output (see Table 2). To this end, the seating capacity, yearly distance flown, fuel type, and operational lifetime are key aircraft characteristics (Table 3), while plants in the AAF supply chain are described by their yearly production capacity and operational lifetime (Table 4). Generally, an older aircraft is replaced before reaching its design lifetime, in the range of 25-30 years, provided that the airline operating it can afford the new model28,55,80. Several economic factors feed into this, which are beyond our scope. Instead, we use a constant maximum age of 22 years for all aircraft and set up an initial fleet with a mean age of around 11 years30.

The fuel type of aircraft factors into their fleet dynamics based on the compatibility of hydrogen aircraft with the flight segments. The value used here (Table 2) indicates what share of aircraft introduced to satisfy the segment’s demand is hydrogen aircraft, provided a suitable hydrogen aircraft exists for the specified time and scenario (Supplementary Fig. 3). Following the Destination 2050 report13, we assume that early hydrogen aircraft exclusively service intra-Europe routes. A potential of 1 implies that all intra-Europe flights are eventually serviced by hydrogen aircraft. However, this does not require all European airports to immediately accommodate hydrogen aircraft, as the new aircraft introduced yearly only represent a minority of the total fleet. Furthermore, to reflect that there could be hydrogen-compatible airports outside of Europe, the extra-Europe wide-body segments are given a hydrogen potential of 0.5.

Fuel supply and fuel product system

We base the introduction of AAF on the ReFuelEU Aviation rules. These describe the minimum volume of compliant AAF that must be used in a given period. This is generalised to a set share per year (Fig. 1c). To evaluate this share, ReFuelEU Aviation specifies that hydrogen should be considered based on energy content18. We extend this to e-fuel, assuming a lower heating value (LHV) for each fuel: 43 MJ/kg for fossil kerosene, 45 MJ/kg for e-fuel, and 120 MJ/kg for hydrogen.

The logical order applied when quantifying the fuel supply starts from the reference flow, with the air traffic demands being used to construct the aircraft fleets (see Fleet dynamics). For each time interval, the activity of the aircraft fleet requires a certain volume of hydrocarbon fuels (here, fossil kerosene and e-fuel) and liquid hydrogen. In scenarios that comply with a certain minimum volume of AAF, all liquid hydrogen contributes to this minimum, with the remainder achieved through e-fuel as part of the total hydrocarbon demand.

Having determined the volume of each fuel required per time interval, the fuel production chains are quantified. For fossil kerosene, this is done by connecting a relevant background process (see Prospective background lifecycle inventories). For the AAF, fleets of key production plants are created. The efficiency of production plants based on emerging technologies is defined as a function of the plant’s construction year. As estimated performances vary, this is considered as sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. 10).

Hydrogen is assumed to be produced through water electrolysis using proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers. The performance of the electrolysers, including future improvements, is based on literature46,56,81 (Supplementary Table 2). The oxygen molecules (O2) obtained from electrolysis are not considered a co-product but are left out of the inventory. Hydrogen distribution is based on Sacchi et al.29, requiring 3.2 kWh/kg electricity for compression. For use on hydrogen aircraft, hydrogen is liquefied after distribution82. Liquefaction is represented by its operational energy demand alone (Supplementary Table 2). Transportation and boil-off losses are each estimated at 1%, resulting in hydrogen emission to the air.

The sorbent-based direct air capture (DAC) system is based on the inventories of Terlouw et al.83. We estimate its performance and learning rates by comparing and combining several sources84,85,86 (Supplementary Table 3). Fischer-Tropsch plants are also described by combining several sources87,88,89. Several products are created in such plants. To isolate impacts related to the production of e-fuel, physical allocation centred around lower heating value (LHV) is applied, in line with the literature. The production process is simplified to flows of CO2, H2, and electricity (Supplementary Table 4). Due to a lack of data, cooling water and wastewater are cut off.

The fuel tank-to-wing phase (i.e., combustion) distinguishes between the three fuels while accounting for the aircraft using the fuel and aspects of the flight itself. The flight is split up into the landing and take-off cycle (LTO), where emissions are relatively low to the ground, and climb/cruise/descent (CCD), where emissions are higher up. Fuel use for LTO is assumed to be consistent across flights, while CCD scales with the flight distance. Inventories for hydrocarbon fuels are based on the EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook90. Metal impurities released when combusting fossil kerosene, taken from the ecoinvent 3.9.1 database91, are also included in these inventories but do not affect climate change. E-fuel is assumed not to have these metal impurities nor sulphur impurities, meaning that no sulphur oxides (SOx) are formed. Inventories for hydrogen use assume a gas turbine63, resulting in NOx emissions and contrail formation, although we make no further distinction with a fuel cell-driven electric powertrain.

Aircraft performance and aircraft product systems

The present fleet is represented using the fuel use, emissions, and seating capacity of common aircraft, used as proxies. These are the Airbus A320 and A320neo narrow-body aircraft and the Boeing 777-300 and Airbus A350-900 wide-body aircraft (Table 3 and Table 5). This choice of reference aircraft is adopted from Grewe et al.30. The newer of these aircraft (meaning the A320neo and A350-900) are also used as reference for future generations (Table 6). The business-as-usual scenario is based on the historical trends in performance observed by Cox et al.55. Grewe et al.30 provide expert estimates for the improvements that could be achieved in conventional aircraft over the course of the coming decades, which forms our optimistic scenario. Speculatively, larger improvements are possible when introducing new aircraft concepts, represented in the breakthrough scenario, which uses values obtained from Cox et al.55.

For hydrogen aircraft, estimates reported by ICAO are used92. These express three scenarios for the fuel use of hydrogen aircraft relative to their contemporary conventional aircraft while accounting for payload capacity. The resulting range aligns with values reported elsewhere82,93,94. To streamline the scenario space, hydrogen and hydrocarbon aircraft performances are combined into a single variable.

Cradle-to-gate and end-of-life processes are included for each aircraft entering and leaving the fleet. We adapt aircraft material composition (Supplementary Table 5) and the energy demands of these processes from Cox et al.55. Industry estimates95,96,97 are used to quantify manufacturing waste through so-called buy-to-fly rations: 8:1 for aluminium alloy95, 1.5:1 for composites96, and 2.2:1 for other materials97. Since hydrogen aircraft are likely to have a higher operating empty weight (OEW) than contemporary hydrocarbon aircraft, their mass is increased by 10%22, but no change to their relative material composition is considered. For the sake of simplicity, aircraft cradle-to-gate and end-of-life processes, including OEW, are considered independent from aircraft performance.

Prospective background lifecycle inventories

The inventories created through the methods described above use economic activities not modelled within this work, but directly adopted from another source. Through these activities, the service system connects itself to the background. The background databases used here are each generated using the Python library premise46. This library enables the transformation of an ecoinvent database to align with the regions and scenarios of an integrated assessment model, adding several additional activities in the process.

The ‘SSP2-PkBudg1150’ pathway of the REMIND model98 is used to generate background databases for the narrative scenarios. In this pathway, the global mean surface temperature increase by 2100 is around 1.7 °C, thereby achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement. Databases are generated for five-year time intervals. Selected flows which connect to the foreground are then exported and linearly interpolated to align with the one-year time interval. The ‘EUR’ region of REMIND is assumed to be representative of the geographic region considered. As a sensitivity analysis, a prospective hydrogen market generated for this pathway by Wei et al.21 is used instead of the assumption that all hydrogen is created through electrolysis (Supplementary Fig. 8).

Impact assessment

Aviation has several environmental effects, noise, air quality degradation, and climate change being among the most prevalent. Focussing on climate change, a topic of interest is the non-CO2 effects of aviation. The most prevalent of these are caused by nitrogen oxides (NOx) and by condensation of water into contrails, resulting in aviation-induced cloudiness (AIC)2. However, the short lifespan of these climate forcers raises conceptual challenges41. For example, calculating the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of a climate forcer simplifies its impact to a static number, but makes it dependent on the chosen time horizon and misrepresents its impact over time40. In order to address these challenges, Allen et al.40 introduced the concept of GWP*, which scales according to the change in emissions over time, rather than the absolute quantity emitted. In the following years, Cain et al.99 and Smith et al.61 expand and refine the calculation of warming-equivalent emissions, focussing their calibration on the impact of methane (CH4). Quantifying climate impacts in terms of warming equivalence is useful in obtaining an impression of the temperature response within the temporal scope considered. This temperature change is calculated by multiplying the warming-equivalent emissions with the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE) factor. Likely, TCRE falls in the range of 0.27-0.63 K per 1000 Gton CO2—here, we use the best estimate of 0.45 K per 1000 Gton CO262. A drawback of expressing impact following warming equivalence is that climate forcing beyond the temporal scope at hand is obfuscated.

Klöwer et al.31, Sacchi et al.29, and Arriolabengoa et al.42 have each assessed aviation based on warming-equivalent emissions, although the details of their implementations vary substantially. We base our calculations on Arriolabengoa et al., directly adapting their code in ours100, defining warming-equivalent emissions as:

$${E}^{* }\left(t\right)=\frac{g(s)}{{{{\rm{AGWP}}}}_{H}}\left[H\left(1-s\right)\frac{\Delta F\left(t\right)}{\Delta t}+{sF}\left(t\right)\right]$$

(1)

where

$$g\left(s\right)=\frac{1-\exp \left(\frac{-s}{1-s}\right)}{s}$$

(2)

As such, warming-equivalent emissions are made up of two terms: the extent to which warming equivalence is determined by a change in radiative forcing ∆F(t) due to variations over a time period ∆t, and the extent to which it is determined by the immediate forcing of those emissions, F(t). The unitless parameter s determines the proportional contribution of each term. AGWPH is the Absolute Global Warming Potential of CO2 with respect to a time horizon H, here, 100 years. We use values for s and ∆t proposed by Arriolabengoa et al. as ‘updated settings’. These represent impacts relating to the lifetime of CH4 (such as the effect of NOx on decreasing atmospheric CH4) following the calibration of Cain et al.99 (s = 0.25, ∆t = 20), while modelling climate forcers with shorter-lived effects (such as persistent contrails) based entirely on year-on-year changes in emission (s = 0.0, ∆t = 1). This is conceptually similar to the approach Sacchi et al. take to very-short-lived effects29.

However, the parameters of Arriolabengoa et al. only extend to non-CO2 effects stemming from flight itself42: contrails, NOx, H2O, soot, and SOx. In order to adequately represent the impact of ground-level activities beyond CO2, we reintroduce the parameters for CH4 and introduce new ones for the direct emission of H2. To do so, we use the radiative efficiency of Paulot et al.101. Hydrogen influences radiative forcing indirectly, by affecting the production of methane, ozone, and stratospheric water. We therefore give it the same warming-equivalent parameters as CH4 and the more persistent effects of NOx. Since the contribution of CH4 and H2 to the results is minimal (Supplementary Fig. 6), we consider it unnecessary to include additional climate forcers, which we expect to have comparable or smaller contributions.

The principle used by Sacchi et al.29 to consider the effect of fuel composition on ice crystal formation64 is adopted. This is estimated using the hydrogen mass fraction of the fuel, which is taken to be 13.73% for fossil kerosene and 15.29% for e-fuel. Following the relation of Sacchi et al., using e-fuel instead of fossil kerosene would reduce AIC impacts by 65.95%. For hydrogen-powered aircraft, we furthermore adopt the assumption of Kossarev et al.22 that e-fuel and hydrogen result in similar AIC impacts. However, Kossarev et al. estimate this reduction to be no more than 40%, indicating that our estimates for AIC of AAF are relatively optimistic.

Silk Way West Airlines orders two additional A350F freighters

Silk Way West Airlines, based in Baku, Azerbaijan, has signed a firm contract for two additional Airbus A350F freighter aircraft, taking its total order to four. The agreement underpins the airline’s fleet modernisation and expansion strategy as it looks to strengthen its position in the global air freight market.

Wolfgang Meier, president of Silk Way West Airlines, said: “We are delighted to extend our partnership with Airbus on the A350F programme. This order, bringing our total commitment to four aircraft, marks a major milestone in our company’s growth and reflects our confidence in the future of sustainable air freight. The A350F will strengthen our leading position in the global air freight market as we continue to modernise our fleet and reduce our carbon footprint.”

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus executive vice-president of sales (Commercial Aircraft business), said: “This repeat order from Silk Way West Airlines, the largest cargo airline in the Caspian Sea region, is a great vote of confidence at a time when the A350F is physically taking shape in our assembly lines. The A350F will ensure the airline maintains its leading position in the global air freight market and further enables its key role in developing Azerbaijan as a major global cargo hub at the heart of the Silk Road.”

The A350F features the largest main deck cargo door in the industry, with fuselage length and capacity optimised around standard pallets and containers. Over 70% of the airframe is made of advanced materials, resulting in a 46-tonne lighter take-off weight than competing derivatives. It is also the only freighter aircraft that will fully meet ICAO’s enhanced CO2 emissions standards, which come into effect in 2027. Assembly of the test aircraft is currently underway in Toulouse.

The A350F can carry a payload of up to 111 tonnes and fly up to 4,700nm. Powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines, the aeroplane will deliver up to 40% lower fuel consumption and carbon emissions compared to previous-generation freighters with similar payload-range capability. It will be able to operate with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at entry into service, with the aim of achieving 100% capability by 2030, in line with all Airbus aircraft. By the end of October 2025, the all-new A350F had secured 74 orders from 12 customers worldwide.

This paves the way for economic production of eSAF at scale, which is critical for decarbonization of the aviation industry.
The eSAF produced will save over 90 percent emissions compared to traditional jet fuel and will comply with international SAF mandates.
The project, known as Eq.flight, will be led by Equilibrion, which NEG8 Carbon said is pioneering the drive to decarbonize aviation using low-carbon nuclear energy through small and advanced modular reactors.
“This positions NEG8 Carbon as one of the leaders in the field to produce sustainable aviation fuel using direct air capture of CO2,” said Ray Naughton, NEG8 Carbon founder and managing director.","Irish direct air capture (DAC) company NEG8 Carbon announced Nov. 19 that it has signed a contract for Phase 1 of a major project in the U.K. to develop large-scale sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) production using a low-carbon energy source.

This paves the way for economic production of eSAF at scale, which is critical for decarbonization of the aviation industry.

The CO2 provided via DAC will be combined with green hydrogen and nuclear-generated electricity to create eSAF in a specialized process.

The eSAF produced will save over 90 percent emissions compared to traditional jet fuel and will comply with international SAF mandates.

The project, known as Eq.flight, will be led by Equilibrion, which NEG8 Carbon said is pioneering the drive to decarbonize aviation using low-carbon nuclear energy through small and advanced modular reactors.

Equilibrion was awarded £1 million (USD$1.32 million) for Phase 1 of the Eq.flight project as part of the U.K. Department of Transport’s Advanced Fuel Fund 2025 investment of £63 million (USD$83.1 million) in 17 clean-aviation initiatives, bringing to £198 million (USD$261.3 million) the total value of state investment in this area since 2022.

NEG8 Carbon’s DAC technology is particularly suitable for this project as it uses low-carbon heat and electricity from nuclear, which the company said greatly reduces the cost and increases efficiency of the DAC process.

“This positions NEG8 Carbon as one of the leaders in the field to produce sustainable aviation fuel using direct air capture of CO2,” said Ray Naughton, NEG8 Carbon founder and managing director. “The potential in this market is driven by the EU and U.K. government mandates to airlines to use more SAF in their fuel mix progressing to 70 percent in the EU by 2050. This creates a global SAF market with a value of $400 billion by 2050. NEG8 Carbon is now positioned to be a major player in this market.”

Philip Rogers and Caroline Longman, co-founders and directors at Equilibrion, said, “We are committed to developing solutions that enable the aviation sector to offer lower-emission flights to customers around the world by leveraging low-carbon nuclear electricity and heat. Power-to-liquids (PTL) powered by advanced nuclear reactors offers the potential for the scale of production needed to make a major impact on climate change.”

Direct air capture is a technology that extracts carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air.

NEG8 Carbon’s DAC technology works by using fans to draw in large quantities of air and passing it through NEG8’s revolutionary low-cost CO2-extraction system.

The extracted CO2 is either permanently stored underground or used practically in carbon-utilization processes.

SAF is produced from a broad range of materials and feedstocks, whereas eSAF is made from CO2 captured from the air and green hydrogen.

DAC is the only technology that can provide a large-scale source of green CO2 at million-ton scale at the eSAF production location.

Equilibrion is a U.K.-based project developer and consultancy focused on using the potential of nuclear power to mitigate climate change.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_fb3406b968f7423bae99ecb7c58dabf1~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_840,h_540,al_c,lg_1,q_85/80995f_fb3406b968f7423bae99ecb7c58dabf1~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-11-27 13:58:59.442869

HEFA SAF requires approximately 50 kg of hydrogen per ton to support hydrotreating, while AtJ SAF also consumes hydrogen during the hydrogenation step to stabilize alcohol-derived intermediates.
In contrast, PtL SAF, produced from green hydrogen and captured CO₂, requires roughly 660 kg of hydrogen per ton of SAF7.
To meet India’s 1% SAF blending target (~112 kilotons of SAF), this translates to ~5.6 kilotons of hydrogen for HEFA/AtJ SAF and ~74 kilotons for PtL SAF.
Overcoming these challenges will require coordinated policy support, technology demonstration, and investment signals, without which hydrogen’s potential to anchor India’s SAF roadmap will remain unrealized.","India’s aviation sector has grown rapidly over the past decade, with domestic passenger numbers increasing from around 50 million in 2010 to approximately 230 million in 20241. To address the sector’s rising emissions, the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Government of India, set an indicative target of blending 1% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) by 2027, increasing to 2% by 2028 and 5% by 2030 for international flights2.

While modest compared to the European Union (EU)’s ReFuel EU mandate (2% by 2025, 20% by 2035), this step is ambitious in India’s context, translating into around 140 million liters (112 kilo tons) of SAF annually3,4. Meeting even India’s initial target will require a rapid scaleup in SAF production, but the availability of sustainable feedstocks remains a critical bottleneck.

India’s Feedstock Dilemma

Major SAF technologies differ in their feedstock requirements. Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) primarily rely on oils and fats, including plant oils, animal fats, and waste cooking oils. Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) uses alcohols derived from sugars or starches, while Fischer-Tropsch (FT) depends on gasified biomass5. Given India’s immature supply chain coupled with infrastructural constraints for suitable oils, fats, and biomass, scaling aviation fuels remains challenging.

This underscores the need to diversify into hydrogen-based Power-to-Liquids (PtL) as a complementary pathway, particularly if India aims to achieve even the initial 1% SAF blending target.

Hydrogen’s Role in SAF Production

Hydrogen is not only a future aviation fuel in its own right, but also a critical enabler of SAF production across all major pathways. In the HEFA route, which produces most of today’s SAF, hydrogen is used in hydrotreating to remove oxygen from oils/fats. In the PtL pathway, green hydrogen combines with captured CO₂ to create syngas that is converted into synthetic kerosene. In the AtJ pathway, hydrogen is required in the hydrogenation step to stabilize intermediates from ethanol or iso-butanol. Together, these pathways highlight hydrogen’s critical role in producing aviation-ready fuels, making the alignment of India’s SAF and hydrogen strategies essential5.

Globally, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects SAF to contribute nearly 65% of aviation’s emission reductions by 2050, with the remaining ~35% coming from hydrogen propulsion, efficiency gains, new aircraft technologies, etc6.

Hydrogen-based PtL Fuels are Essential

The hydrogen requirement for SAF production varies significantly depending on the production pathway. HEFA SAF requires approximately 50 kg of hydrogen per ton to support hydrotreating, while AtJ SAF also consumes hydrogen during the hydrogenation step to stabilize alcohol-derived intermediates. In contrast, PtL SAF, produced from green hydrogen and captured CO₂, requires roughly 660 kg of hydrogen per ton of SAF7.

To meet India’s 1% SAF blending target (~112 kilotons of SAF), this translates to ~5.6 kilotons of hydrogen for HEFA/AtJ SAF and ~74 kilotons for PtL SAF. Looking further ahead to 2030, with an estimated 16 MMT of ATF consumption8, achieving a 5% SAF blend (~800 kilotons) would require around 40 kilotons of hydrogen for conventional HEFA/AtJ SAF and roughly 528 kilotons for PtL SAF.

This represents about 0.8% of India’s projected 5 MMT (by 2030) green hydrogen target for HEFA/AtJ SAF and roughly 10.6% for PtL SAF, illustrating the substantially higher hydrogen demand for synthetic SAF production, and the critical role hydrogen will play in enabling scalable, sustainable aviation fuels in India.

Why Hydrogen Matters for India’s SAF Roadmap

With India setting its SAF blending targets, the critical question is not just how much SAF is needed, but how it will be produced at scale. Hydrogen provides a unique lever here, not as a competing fuel, but as the backbone of synthetic SAF pathways that can complement limited bio-based options.

Hydrogen strengthens India’s SAF strategy in several critical ways:

Feedstock security: Relying on HEFA technology is not a sustainable long-term strategy for India, given its dependence on a weak and underdeveloped supply chain for oils and fats. These feedstocks are in limited supply and face high competition from the food and industrial sectors, placing additional stress on an already fragile system.

Scalability: Unlike bio-based SAF, which is capped by land and feedstock availability, hydrogen-based PtL can scale in line with India’s renewable energy expansion. With ambitious targets of 500 GW of renewables by 2030, India has the potential to anchor a robust PtL supply chain for aviation.

Policy alignment: India has already launched four hydrogen valleys in Pune, Kerala, Odisha, and Rajasthan, as regional innovation clusters for hydrogen production, storage, and use. These could anchor future SAF production units by supplying hydrogen directly to airport-linked blending facilities.

Export opportunity: Mandates in the EU (2% by 2025, 70% by 2050), the UK (10% by 2030, 22% by 2040), the US (3 billion gallons by 2030 under the SAF Grand Challenge), and Japan (10% by 2030 for international flights) will create sustained global demand for SAF9. By aligning its SAF and hydrogen strategies with these international targets, India can position itself as a reliable contributor to global supply chains while strengthening its own energy transition.

Roadblocks on India’s Hydrogen-to-SAF Journey

While hydrogen offers a long-term solution for scalable SAF, its adoption faces significant economic, technological, and policy hurdles. Addressing these barriers is critical if India is to move beyond pilot projects and establish PtL as a viable pathway for aviation decarbonization.

High costs: Green hydrogen in India today costs around $4–5/kg, which translates into PtL SAF costs of $8–10/l. This is far higher than the conventional process. For PtL SAF to be commercially viable, hydrogen prices need to fall closer to $2/kg, a level not yet achieved.

Capital intensity and infrastructure needs: PtL production requires investment in large-scale electrolysers, CO₂ capture systems, and Fischer–Tropsch or methanol to jet conversion units. Developing this infrastructure involves multi-billion-dollar outlays and long construction timelines, making financing difficult without strong policy support or long-term offtake agreements.

CO₂ supply chain: PtL SAF depends on a steady stream of concentrated CO₂. In India, carbon capture and utilization infrastructure is still nascent, and transporting CO₂ from industrial clusters to SAF plants adds cost and complexity. Building reliable CO₂ logistics is therefore a major bottleneck.

Technology maturity: Unlike HEFA and AtJ, which are already proven at or near commercial scale, PtL remains at TRL 6–7 globally, with only a handful of pilot and early demonstration plants in operation. India lacks experience with such projects, creating uncertainty over efficiency, yields, and integration with refinery or airport operations.

Overcoming these challenges will require coordinated policy support, technology demonstration, and investment signals, without which hydrogen’s potential to anchor India’s SAF roadmap will remain unrealized.

The Way Forward: Unlocking Hydrogen-enabled SAF

To translate ambition into action, India must create the right policy, financing, and infrastructure environment. Key priorities include:

Global positioning: Leverage India’s potential for low-cost green hydrogen to tap into export opportunities. With the EU, UK, US, and Japan setting ambitious SAF mandates, India can position itself as a competitive supplier to meet the emerging demand gap.

Policy integration: Extend support under the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) to SAF projects, ensuring hydrogen use in aviation is explicitly recognized. This will align India’s aviation decarbonization with its broader hydrogen strategy.

Demonstration at scale: Fund and fast-track 1–2 PtL pilot projects (similar to Norsk e-Fuel in Norway or Atmosfair in Germany) to build local experience, validate technology performance, and de-risk investment.

Market creation: Provide targeted incentives for airlines through viability gap funding and tradable carbon credits to offset the current cost premium of SAF and send a clear demand signal.

Hub development: Position refineries and major airports as dual decarbonization hubs. Refineries bring hydrogen expertise and proximity to CO₂ sources, while airports can host SAF blending and hydrogen pilots with major hubs. Together, these can create integrated supply chains linking hydrogen, CO₂, and aviation fuel demand.

Conclusion

India’s aviation sector is at a pivotal moment in its energy transition. With surging domestic air travel and established SAF blending targets, the challenge lies not in ambition, but scale, and here hydrogen is the critical unlock. Conventional SAF routes like HEFA are constrained by weak and underdeveloped oil/fat supply chains, while AtJ depends on biomass, which is already stretched across other programs.

Hydrogen, by contrast, enables PtLs, a pathway independent of traditional biomass-based feedstocks, scalable with India’s renewable energy growth, and capable of meeting both domestic and global SAF demand. By aligning SAF ambitions with the NGHM, and leveraging airports and refineries as decarbonization hubs, India can establish hydrogen as the cornerstone of a sustainable aviation future.

Why the Middle East Several fundamental characteristics explain why the Middle East has become one of the world’s fastest-growing private aviation markets.
Infrastructure that supports scale The expansion of private aviation in the Middle East has also been accelerated by modern, well-financed infrastructure.
Regional economic transformations The rise of private aviation in the Middle East cannot be separated from the region’s economic transformation.
In this transformation, the Middle East is not simply participating in a global trend; it is helping define it.","Private aviation has long occupied a distinctive corner of global air transport. For most of its history, it served a narrow group of users: government leaders, corporate executives and high-net-worth individuals who required discretion, direct routing and time efficiency. Its scale was modest and its growth uneven. The economics of the sector rose and fell with corporate cycles, and demand was concentrated in the United States and Western Europe. For decades, private aviation was important to those who relied on it, but it remained peripheral to the wider aviation system.

Its limitations were technical as much as economic. Early jets could not fly long distances without multiple stops, and their operational flexibility was heavily constrained. They were true premium assets, but they were not yet strategic tools. The industry operated according to the rhythm of business travel in mature economies, and few expected that its global geography would one day shift.

Technology and wealth redraw the map

The first major turning point arrived in the early 2000s, when manufacturers introduced long-range, large-cabin aircraft capable of connecting distant financial and industrial centres.

The Gulfstream G550, Bombardier Global Express and Dassault Falcon 7X redefined the limits of private aviation. Journeys that once required multiple segments—Dubai to London, Jeddah to Singapore—became nonstop. Private aviation could now offer significant time savings, with considerably lower operational friction.

At the same time, global wealth distribution was becoming increasingly unequal. Emerging markets generated new investors, entrepreneurs and family conglomerates whose activities were increasingly international. Many were based in regions where commercial aviation was not fully aligned with executive requirements. Private aviation began to expand beyond its historical centres, establishing footholds in the Middle East, China, India and parts of Africa. The sector was no longer exclusively tied to Fortune-500 travel patterns; it was becoming part of the global investment landscape and cross-border business.

The pandemic and the rewiring of demand

The COVID-19 pandemic created the most significant shock in the history of private aviation. Commercial networks contracted sharply, and scheduling became unpredictable. Cross-border travel has become more complex, from testing requirements to limited routing options. In this environment, private aviation became not merely an alternative but a necessity for travellers who required certainty.

A substantial number of first-time users entered the market during this period, and many remained active even after commercial aviation recovered. Charter utilisation increased, fractional ownership expanded, and membership programmes gained momentum. By 2023, private aviation had moved from the fringes of the industry to a central position in the mobility strategies of corporations, investors and high-net-worth individuals.

This global restructuring created new questions about which regions would shape the next decade of growth. It soon became evident that the Middle East had the right mix of geography, wealth, and infrastructure to emerge as a leading centre of private aviation activity.

Why the Middle East

Several fundamental characteristics explain why the Middle East has become one of the world’s fastest-growing private aviation markets.

Geography is central. The region is positioned at the intersection of Europe, Asia and Africa, and its most common business routes are long-haul rather than short-distance. In this context, large-cabin and ultra-long-range jets offer clear advantages. No region outside North America relies so heavily on this upper segment of the private-jet fleet.

Economic structure reinforces this geographical advantage. The Gulf is home to some of the world’s highest concentrations of wealth, including sovereign funds, family offices and multinational corporate headquarters. These institutions operate across continents and require mobility that aligns with complex investment flows and project oversight. Private aviation enables direct travel between strategic locations without the constraints of commercial scheduling, making it an essential tool rather than a discretionary luxury.

Infrastructure that supports scale

The expansion of private aviation in the Middle East has also been accelerated by modern, well-financed infrastructure.

Countries such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia have invested heavily in fixed-base operators, private terminals and maintenance facilities that match or outperform those in more established aviation markets. This infrastructure reduces operational delays, enhances reliability and supports higher fleet utilisation. In turn, it has encouraged operators to expand their presence and invest in new aircraft.

These developments have enabled the region to support rapid, stable demand growth. Data shows that the Middle East and Africa business-jet market is valued at approximately $1.4 billion in 2025 and is expected to exceed $2.1 billion by 2030. This trajectory implies annual growth close to 9%, significantly higher than the global average. Projections for 2026 to 2035 indicate that the region will acquire roughly 160 new business aircraft valued at $8.6 billion, with the majority being long-range models suited to regional travel profiles.

Diversification of business models

One of the most important developments in the Middle Eastern private-aviation sector is the diversification of its customer base and business models.

Charter activity has expanded as digital platforms simplify access and reduce the administrative barriers associated with traditional private-jet booking. Fractional ownership and jet-membership schemes have also gained ground, creating more predictable revenue streams for operators and lowering the financial threshold for customers.

These shifts matter because they make the industry less vulnerable to economic cycles. While private aviation will always reflect broader macroeconomic trends, the expansion of charter and membership models has introduced a degree of stability that was not present two decades ago. The sector is evolving into a more mature, structurally supported component of the regional economy.

Regional economic transformations

The rise of private aviation in the Middle East cannot be separated from the region’s economic transformation.

Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 has created large, geographically dispersed industrial and tourism projects requiring frequent senior-level travel. The UAE’s continued development as a global business and tourism hub generates constant movement between international markets. Qatar’s growing investment portfolio reinforces similar patterns of mobility. In each case, private aviation enables the speed and flexibility required to manage projects, partnerships, and capital flows.

Tourism and events further strengthen demand. The Middle East has become a global host for investment conferences, major cultural gatherings and high-profile sporting events. These occasions significantly increase private-jet arrivals, and their frequency signals the region’s long-term role as an international events hub.

The next decade

As the region continues to expand its private-aviation footprint, several long-term trends will shape the next decade. One of the most visible is fleet modernisation. Operators are increasingly investing in aircraft with greater fuel efficiency, advanced avionics and improved operating economics. These upgrades reduce long-term costs and align with the region’s ambition to establish a modern, resilient aviation ecosystem.

Sustainability will play an increasingly important role in shaping both operational decisions and regulatory frameworks. Although private aviation faces scrutiny over emissions, manufacturers have begun producing aircraft that are compatible with higher blends of sustainable aviation fuel. The Middle East’s early investment in SAF production, particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, suggests that supply chains will gradually expand, enabling cleaner operations.

Advanced air mobility represents another shift. Electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft are expected to appear in the Gulf within the next decade. These aircraft will complement, rather than compete with, long-range business jets by providing short-distance connectivity between airports, city centres and coastal developments. Their integration into private-aviation networks could reshape how high-net-worth travellers move within metropolitan areas.

A moving market

Private aviation has travelled a long distance from its origins as a narrow, cyclical segment of global aviation.

The Middle East’s rise as a private-aviation hub reflects deeper economic and geographic trends: diversified economies, high levels of cross-border investment, world-class infrastructure and a strategic location between major global regions. As the industry modernises, adopts cleaner technologies and integrates new mobility systems, private aviation is becoming more embedded in the mechanisms of regional growth.

The next decade will not only bring more aircraft and higher utilisation, but also greater efficiency. It will reshape mobility in the Gulf’s economic model, making private aviation a structural element of investment flows, tourism development, industrial strategy, and global connectivity. In this transformation, the Middle East is not simply participating in a global trend; it is helping define it.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/11/27/Global-Express-XRS-Exterior-Australia-Sunset_1-scaled-1-scaled.webp,N,,2025-11-27 14:56:48.035118

“If we think about fuel and fuel security, we think there is a national interest that could come from that as well.
“The fleet renewal that is under way is the largest renewal we have ever done in our history,” Ms Hudson said.
All the aircraft, like the rest of the Qantas fleet, will carry Australian products and suppliers on board.
Making Australians proud of Qantas is what we are really purposeful about.” Vanessa Hudson is chief executive and managing director of Qantas.","Ms Hudson told The Australian that Qantas – which spends $5bn a year on fuel – believed Australia was well placed to develop its own local sustainable aviation fuel resource.

But ongoing government support would be crucial to make the fuel commercially viable.

“We think there is a great opportunity to work with the Australian government to find more of those opportunities and really set a course to create a new industry of sustainable aviation fuel in Australia,” the CEO said, citing a fledgling north Queensland operation turning sugar cane by-product into ethanol as the basis for aviation fuel.

“We are a country that should be able to lead technically in this space because we’ve got significant agriculture and feedstock for such an industry, which could create economic growth and 13,000 more jobs.

“If we think about fuel and fuel security, we think there is a national interest that could come from that as well. These things are never easy, it is new technology and the government has taken really positive steps so far on this journey and we are looking forward to continuing to work with them.”

It was revealed in September that after years of lobbying by the aviation industry, the federal government announced it would contribute $1.1bn to power the production of “greener” fuel that would help airlines reduce their carbon footprint.

Meanwhile, Ms Hudson confirmed that Qantas was on track with its plans to complete a historic fleet renewal, including the ambitious Project Sunrise, enabling direct flights from Sydney and Melbourne to New York and London from next year using the Airbus A350-1000.

“The fleet renewal that is under way is the largest renewal we have ever done in our history,” Ms Hudson said.

“We are renewing the Jetstar fleet, we are renewing the domestic narrow-body fleet, we’re introducing the breakthrough Project Sunrise long-range aircraft next year. Then we will start to renew the international fleet from there.”

As Airbus builds the aircraft in Toulouse, the Australian-based Project Sunrise team busily preparing for the historic flights include fleet programs teams, flight planning, network, flight operations, cabin crew, operations centres, airports, lounges, engineering and operational readiness teams. All the aircraft, like the rest of the Qantas fleet, will carry Australian products and suppliers on board.

Ms Hudson, celebrating two years in the top job, says her team made a decision to have a laser-focus on the basics to turn the airline’s fortunes around.

“At the top of the list is on-time performance and reliability. Qantas Domestic is now back as being the most reliable, Jetstar has lifted materially and so has Qantas International,” she said.

“We have stabilised things and we’ve got our customer satisfaction and our performance back to a really good place, but what is really important looking forward is that we get this fleet renewal done.

“We hold the fact that Australians have pride in Qantas close to our heart. Making Australians proud of Qantas is what we are really purposeful about.”

With the high profit margins giving VAM producers a positive outlook for increasing production and, therefore, flexibility to offer lower prices, many consumers were remaining cautious about making large purchases.

The decline in VAM prices was happening at the same time as there was a lot of available supply. Most of the needs were satisfied by domestic suppliers. There were no disruptions in either the Gulf Coast ethylene supply or natural gas supply. The moderate prices of energy helped maintain healthy operating profit margins for VAM producers, who therefore continued to operate at high levels of production capacity.

The combination of changes in feedstock dynamics contributed to the softness within the industry. Acetic acid's price decrease was rather limited, while ethylene experienced significantly larger drops, translating into lower costs for production. As a result, with both items decreasing, there is now less cost support from Acetic Acid and Ethylene, plus VAM's only remaining support will be competitive pressure.

The VAM demand signals are mixed with steady consumption in PVA applications such as packages, construction, adhesives, and detergent pods, indicating a degree of resiliency. However, the overall market confidence is being brought down by weakness in the EVA segment, where, due to declining orders for photovoltaic and foam products, there has been a slowdown in the production and sales of these products. The competitive nature of the overseas offers further adds to this pressure and restricts the potential for any domestic pricing rebound.

In November, Celanese, an industry-leading producer of VAM, announced its 3rd quarter results for 2025. These results are indicative of the larger difficulties being faced by chemical markets. For the 3rd quarter, Celanese had net sales for the quarter of $2.4 billion, representing a 4% decrease from the previous quarter; both volumes and prices have declined. Celanese indicated that demand headwinds are impacting all its end-use sectors, and thus, has created a cautious purchasing environment, which has affected the way VAM is being traded in the month of November.

As we move forward, the recent bearish trend for VAM prices will likely continue short term because of the influx of bears and the reliability of plants. However, given that a significant portion (61%) of VAM production comes from the industrial-grade market, there is still strong demand within the coatings and adhesives markets to help offset pricing decreases.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-27 11:57:39.379436

The report concludes that the global energy transition will only be fair and effective if it acknowledges the diversity of pathways.","The Bioeconomy Observatory of Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV) releases a groundbreaking study analyzing the effectiveness of tropical bioenergy in the global energy transition and the distortions caused by international policies that, under the guise of sustainability, end up favoring selected technologies over more effective alternatives for emission reductions.

The report, titled ""Tropical bioenergy and the dilemmas of the energy transition: technological neutrality and global valuation of national solutions,"" warns of the risks of an asymmetrically driven transition marked by climate barriers that could penalize low-carbon solutions developed by tropical countries. The study argues that climate and energy policies must be guided by technological neutrality and the evaluation of the effective climate performance of different decarbonization pathways—not by geopolitical, technological, or regional preferences.

""The energy transition needs to be guided by performance, not by preferences. Brazil demonstrates that it is possible to utilize local solutions to reduce emissions on a large scale with economic sustainability, social inclusion, and local innovation,"" summarizes Luciano Rodrigues, research coordinator.

Mobility: tropical efficiency exceeds global powers

The report takes vehicle mobility as an example and highlights how tropical solutions can be effective, accessible, and scalable in decarbonization.

Based on Life Cycle Analysis (LCA)—which considers emissions from vehicle and fuel production to usage and disposal—the study shows that new vehicles sold in Brazil emit, on average, 31% less CO₂ per kilometer than those in the European Union, 34% less than those in the United States, and 42% below the Chinese average.

A hydrated ethanol vehicle (E100) emits about 85 gCO₂e/km, a value nearly three times lower than that of gasoline vehicles in developed markets, whose averages range from 232 to 241 gCO₂e/km. Even flex-fuel models (E50)—fueled with half ethanol and half gasoline—maintain an advantage of 60 to 70 gCO₂e/km over international averages.

For hybrids (HEVs), Brazilian performance is even more impressive: a hybrid powered exclusively by ethanol (E100 HEV) emits only 79 gCO₂e/km, surpassing pure electric vehicles (BEVs) in the markets of Europe, the U.S., and China, where emissions range from 128 to 233 gCO₂e/km when including the footprints of battery production and disposal.

""Sustainable biofuel and electrification deliver immediate efficiency with competitive costs, existing supply networks, and low climate impact. It is a tropical solution with global results,"" adds Rodrigues.

Share of different classes of new vehicles in sales in 2024 and average GHG emissions (sales in % and emissions in g CO2 eq./km)

Distortions and barriers in global policies

The analysis challenges recurring narratives, such as the supposed ""food versus fuel"" dilemma—according to which the production of biofuels competes with food production. Data show that this hypothesis does not hold: bioenergy has contributed to generating jobs and income, elevating agricultural productivity, and strengthening food security, provided it is produced sustainably.

Another sensitive point is the application of so-called indirect land use change (iLUC) factors with generic parameters and without scientific consensus that disproportionately penalize biofuels. The study notes that these criteria are rarely applied to other energy sources that also alter land use and do not reflect the specificities of the Brazilian model, such as the use of second-crop corn and the recovery of degraded pastures.

In the European Union, recent policies impose strict limits on the use of agricultural biofuels and apply multiplication factors that artificially increase the weight of electricity and synthetic fuels in renewable energy targets. The ReFuelEU itself excludes conventional biofuels from the definition of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In the United States, Brazilian corn ethanol is treated the same as American ethanol, imposing penalties based on indirect emissions that do not reflect the tropical reality.

""Although Brazil's results are concrete and verifiable, biofuels are still viewed with suspicion by some countries. There is bias and an absence of objective criteria in defining what is ‘green’ or ‘clean’,"" emphasizes Rodrigues.

Technological neutrality and energy integration

The study recommends that technological neutrality be adopted as a guiding principle of decarbonization policies, ensuring equitable conditions of recognition and incentive for all pathways that demonstrate measurable and scientifically proven climate efficiency.

For Brazil, the authors propose strengthening structural programs such as RenovaBio, sustainable mobility policies, the biogas program, and the development of the market for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), ensuring regulatory predictability and eliminating fiscal distortions that favor technologies without proof of lower carbon intensity.

The importance of integrating bioenergy and electrification in mobility is also emphasized, creating a hybrid decarbonization model capable of uniting efficient combustion engines and complementary electric traction.

Climate diplomacy and the leadership of the Global South

The authors highlight that Brazil must strengthen its international role to reposition tropical solutions in the global climate agenda. This movement involves coordinated diplomatic action with emerging countries to harmonize criteria for recognizing sustainable biofuels and consolidate bioenergy as a legitimate tool for decarbonization.

The study emphasizes that Brazil should play an active leadership role in multilateral forums, advocating for metrics based on real emission performance rather than technological preferences. This strategy should be accompanied by knowledge generation regarding Brazilian systems and structured international communication, supported by comparative data, verifiable life cycle analyses, and scientific evidence.

Performance, equity, and recognition

With over 60% of the country's renewable energy deriving from bioenergy and nearly 30% of the internal energy supply connected to agribusiness, Brazil is already a green power, although not always recognized as such.

The report concludes that the global energy transition will only be fair and effective if it acknowledges the diversity of pathways. It is not about choosing a technology, but about measuring results fairly, transparently, and comparably.

The Bishop of Chester, the Rt Revd Mark Tanner, then rose to give his maiden speech during the first half-hour.
“I confess that sustainable aviation fuel was not a subject that I imagined I would be addressing when various noble Lords have given me advice about maiden speeches,” he began.
“We on the Liberal Democrat Benches welcome these steps to decarbonise our aviation industry, including investment in sustainable aviation fuels,” Baroness Pidgeon said.
“The Bill will kick-start the UK SAF industry, attracting investment and creating jobs,” he concluded.","THE world’s population has not been given “a spare planet” by God, a bishop said during the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill debate in the House of Lords last week.

Introducing the session, the Rail Minister, Lord Hendy, described the “huge economic benefits for the wider low-carbon fuels industry” of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and the UK’s initiatives “to decarbonise aviation”.

The Bishop of Chester, the Rt Revd Mark Tanner, then rose to give his maiden speech during the first half-hour. “I confess that sustainable aviation fuel was not a subject that I imagined I would be addressing when various noble Lords have given me advice about maiden speeches,” he began. “They said I would be working with high-flyers . . . that not everything was rocket science. Sustainability matters: the good Lord provided us with many things, but a spare planet was not among them, at least in this age.”

He referred to “this balance of pragmatisms” and the “need to be real about air travel being vital to modern life. It builds community, enables encounter, and crosses divides.” One such example was “Manchester Airport, where one actually lands in the diocese of Chester but disembarks in the diocese of Manchester”.

He said that “air travel does more than build community: it enables partnership and commerce. It is a vital part of the defence of our nation, as I witnessed when offering chaplaincy to our Armed Forces.” At the same time, “its environmental impact must be addressed. This means that Net Zero matters, but it is not the only sustainability consideration.”

He welcomed the “creation of an economic framework in which SAF becomes a viable investment”, but warned that “by itself, the Bill does not do nearly enough.” He spoke out for investment “in rail and in environmental road transport” and “timescales for substantive provision of third-generation SAF”: “Our infrastructure must line up with our fundamental identity and core vocation if we are to thrive.”

A former Transport Secretary, Lord Grayling (Conservative), said that the “aviation industry is under growing pressure over its carbon footprint” and it was subject to “flight shaming” from younger customers. “Our aviation sector is . . . a key part of our economy: it is the strongest sector in Europe; it is fundamental to our regions and to the economy of so many different parts of the country.” He urged the Government “to encourage serious investment here”.

Lord Berkeley (Labour) wanted to link the Bill to housing and domestic fuel with “a win-win solution for aviation and home heating”. For the Green Party’s Baroness Jones, the Government’s “aims for a greener, cleaner future for aviation” were “a very noble aim, but . . . impossible unless we radically rethink how we are going to deal with it”.

Viscount Trenchard (Conservative) was concerned that “the effect of the Bill is to distort the market for sustainable aviation fuel” and that “the cost of this distortion will be borne ultimately by consumers”. For Viscount Hanworth (Labour), the Bill was “a weak proposal for addressing a crisis”.

“We on the Liberal Democrat Benches welcome these steps to decarbonise our aviation industry, including investment in sustainable aviation fuels,” Baroness Pidgeon said. “However, we see SAF as just the first step: we want it to offer a real low-carbon alternative.”

Many of the speakers praised the Bishop of Chester’s first remarks in the Lords.

In summing up, Lord Hendy said that he agreed with Bishop Tanner “that sustainability matters” and that he was “sorry about his train service” where there were often delays. “The Bill will kick-start the UK SAF industry, attracting investment and creating jobs,” he concluded. “By addressing the market and investment uncertainty in SAF production, it will enable the UK to lead the way to greener aviation.”

Having been read a second time, the Bill will return to the Lords on 10 December, for the Committee Stage.","https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/media/5704233/3c0jc99-20251126115715501_web.jpg?center=0.39906103286384975,0.403125&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134087056010000000",N,,2025-11-27 07:56:43.067536

PUNE: Short-distance flights between Pune and Mumbai are environmentally disastrous, especially given the robust infrastructure connecting the two cities, said former Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) chairman Shrikant Vaidya on Tuesday. ""Flying is extremely harmful to the environment from the point of view of greenhouse gases. In fact, I was just doing a study... I think it is criminal to fly from Mumbai to Pune because of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions,"" Vaidya said at an event organised by the Pune International Centre. He noted that airplanes on this route emit four times the greenhouse gases compared to railways. Vaidya highlighted the difficulty of decarbonising the aviation sector. Global consumption of aviation turbine fuel currently stands at about 70 lakh barrels per day and is projected to rise to 90 lakh barrels due to the exponential growth in air travel. He added that battery technology is not a viable replacement for jet fuel ""by a long shot"" as it would make flying economically unviable. Instead of relying solely on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — which he estimates will contribute only 1% of total fuel needs —Vaidya suggested that the government must incentivise rail travel. He urged India to replicate the high-speed rail networks of Japan and China to reduce the carbon footprint. ""In India, 60% of flights are between the top eight metro cities. If we replicate high-speed rail infrastructure in these cities, it will reduce flight frequency. Even if railways replace 10-30% of these flights, it will be a major step towards decarbonisation,"" he said. On the topic of energy security, Vaidya addressed India's dependency on crude oil imports. He suggested looking to Asian peers like Japan, China, and South Korea by creating substantial strategic oil reserves to buffer against global price volatility. He also advocated for a policy of ""equity oil"" — buying stakes in offshore oilfields — to reduce import costs. ""This is the right time for implementing such policies, as oil prices are relatively stable and several new countries are discovering oil,"" he said.

The development of synthetic fuels compatible with existing infrastructure is presented as one of the most realistic ways to reduce emissions in these activities over the next decade.","The Bierzo region is preparing to host one of the most ambitious projects in the field of sustainable aviation fuels in Spain. The City of Energy Foundation (CIUDEN), based in Ponferrada and with a technology center in Cubillos del Sil (León), has launched the development of a synthetic fuels pilot plant designed to decarbonize air transport and other sectors where direct electrification is very difficult.

This new facility is part of the European energy transition strategy and will have the support of Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan through funds Next Generation USThe objective is clear: test on a semi-industrial scale technologies that allow the generation of next-generation renewable fuels, especially SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), ready to replace fossil kerosene without drastic changes to the current fleet.

A pilot plant for synthetic fuels in the heart of El Bierzo

CIUDEN's initiative envisions the construction of a experimental pilot plant at the Technology Development Center of Cubillos del Sil, conceived as a testing ground for the production of sustainable synthetic hydrocarbonsThe installation will allow working with both advanced biofuels derived from biomass as with non-biological renewable fuels (NBRF), all of which are compatible with current energy infrastructures.

The project has been awarded to the Eurecat Foundationwhich will be responsible for supplying and implementing the plant's main technology. The contract amounts to 823.895 Euros and sets as the execution horizon June 2026, the date on which the facility is expected to be fully operational for continued testing.

CIUDEN, an agency dependent on Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, emphasizes that the plant will be used to obtain technical data at near-industrial scale, an essential condition for making the subsequent leap to larger commercial projects in Spain and the rest of Europe.

According to the entity, the plant is designed as a flexible environment, capable of adapting to different synthesis gases and configurationsThis will allow the study of various technological routes towards sustainable aviation fuels and other energy products.

In parallel, the initiative is integrated into the just transition strategy for the Bierzo basin, seeking to transform a territory affected by the closure of thermal power plants into decarbonization innovation hub linked to green hydrogen and renewable fuels.

Fischer-Tropsch technology: the heart of the plant

The technological focus of the facility will be a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reactor, a technology known in the industry but which will be applied here with synthesis gases from renewable sourcesThis reactor will allow the transformation of different gas streams into sustainable liquid fuels, suitable for further refining and use in aviation or heavy transport.

The green synthesis gas that will fuel the reactor will be generated via four complementary routes, designed to test combinations and maximize the system versatilityOn the one hand, it will be used green hydrogen produced at CIUDEN through PEM and solid oxide electrolysers (SOEC), which will be combined with CO₂ captured to form the appropriate mixture. In addition, synthesis gas from the biomass gasifier already existing in the center.

These currents are in addition to the gas generated by the engine itself. SOEC electrolyzer in co-electrolysis modewhich allows the direct production of a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide from renewable electricity and CO₂. Finally, the installation is designed to hybridize these four paths, which makes it one of the most pilot plants flexible and unique in Europe in this ambit.

The design takes into account the possibility of test multiple catalysts and advanced materialsBy varying pressures, temperatures, and operating conditions, different configurations can be evaluated to optimize both performance and selectivity for specific hydrocarbon fractions.

The plant will have sampling systems capable of separating up to six different hydrocarbon fractionsThis will allow for a detailed study of the resulting mixtures. Overall, the planned processing more than 40 tons of gases per yeara sufficient quantity to carry out representative testing campaigns under near-industrial conditions.

Integration with methanol and synthetic natural gas in a power-to-X ecosystem

The sustainable aviation fuel plant will not be alone. CIUDEN is working in parallel on the commissioning of two other pilot installations intended to produce green methanol y synthetic natural gasalso from renewable hydrogen and CO₂ capturedThese plants have been awarded in previous phases and will be integrated with the new SAF facility.

The result will be a genuine ecosystem biomass/power-to-X, in which renewable electricity and the area will be transformed into different high value-added synthetic fuelsThis approach seeks to maximize the use of available resources and offer flexibility in the face of future energy demand.

Production renewable methanol It is considered especially relevant, both as a basic chemical and as a potential marine fuel and energy storage medium. In parallel, the synthetic natural gas It can be injected into gas networks or used in industrial applications, facilitating the gradual replacement of fossil gas.

The interaction between these three plants —SAF, methanol and synthetic natural gas— will allow us to study operational synergiesEnergy integration schemes and flexibility strategies that can then be replicated in commercial initiatives in other parts of Spain and Europe.

In addition, CIUDEN and the technology center Eurecat They had already made progress in the design of a specific high-purity green methanol plant, which strengthens the position of both players in the race to develop sustainable synthetic fuels at the European level.

Renewable energy, advanced storage and SAF production

One of the key points of the project is that the entire system will be powered by electrical energy from renewable sources generated within CIUDEN's own facilities, primarily from photovoltaic plantsTo manage this electricity efficiently, the foundation will deploy a advanced energy storage system based on various battery technologies.

Specifically, batteries will be installed lithium-ion, sodium-sulfur y vanadium fluxThese batteries will allow hydrogen production to be adapted to the availability of renewable energy, smoothing out the variations inherent in these sources. They will power the... PEM and SOEC electrolyzers, responsible for producing the green hydrogen that acts as the central energy vector in the project.

This renewable hydrogen will be used to generate three types of sustainable synthetic fuels: SAF or e-SAF (sustainable aviation fuel), renewable methanol y synthetic natural gasThe possibility of producing them in an integrated way in the same environment makes Cubillos del Sil a privileged laboratory for the transportation decarbonization and from the industry.

In the case of SAFThe goal is to obtain a fuel that can for direct use in aircraft engines existing, complying with international standards and contributing to the mandatory blending targets set by the European Regulation ReFuelEU AviationThis approach is especially relevant for airlines and operators that need short- and medium-term solutions to reduce their climate footprint.

The Ministry for Ecological Transition and CIUDEN emphasize that this set of facilities will operate in a semi-industrial environment, with a scale sufficient to assess the technical and economic viability of the technologies before their mass deployment in the European market.

Calendar, European funding and the role of Eurecat

The development of the pilot plant of sustainable aviation fuel It relies on funding from PRTR, the Spanish instrument for channeling funds Next Generation USThis European contribution allows for investments in R&D&I applied to decarbonization which could hardly be undertaken with national or private resources alone.

El supply contract The contract for the plant has been awarded to the Eurecat FoundationA technology center with expertise in advanced chemical processes and catalyst development. The amount totals 823.895 Euros, and the document sets an execution deadline that extends until June of 2026, at which point the installation must be completed and ready to operate.

In previous phases, CIUDEN and Eurecat had already collaborated on the design of a pilot plant for green methanolThe project began with an initial phase focused on the development and validation of reactors and catalysts, and a second phase dedicated to the construction of the facility in Cubillos del Sil. This prior experience is now being leveraged to accelerate the deployment of the new plant, which is geared towards SAF and other renewable fuels.

The project will not only have a technological impact, but also territorial impact, by contributing to consolidating in El Bierzo an industrial fabric linked to the energy transition, with the potential to generate skilled employment and new opportunities in an area marked by the closure of the old Compostilla thermal power plant.

Alongside the CIUDEN initiative, other production projects are being promoted in the same region. e-SAF and renewable hydrogen derivatives, which reinforces the idea of ​​turning Cubillos del Sil and its surroundings into a strategic hub for sustainable fuels at a national level.

International benchmark in decarbonization of aviation and heavy transport

La coordinated implementation The SAF plant and the methanol and synthetic natural gas facilities are planned for mid 2026Once operational, the complex will transform the CIUDEN center in Cubillos del Sil into a national and international benchmark in emerging technologies for the decarbonization of sectors where there are currently few alternatives.

The focus is especially on the commercial aviation and the long-haul heavy transportThese are sectors that cannot be easily electrified and require fuels with high energy density. The development of synthetic fuels compatible with existing infrastructure is presented as one of the most realistic ways to reduce emissions in these activities over the next decade.

As pointed out Alberto Gómez-Barea, technical director of CIUDEN's R&D&i area, the plant will allow the Bercian center to be consolidated as international reference facility in the production of sustainable synthetic fuels, a key piece on the path towards climate neutrality in sectors such as aviation.

The project aims to obtain detailed technical information The study examines the performance of different technologies under conditions close to industrial reality, including process efficiency, catalyst stability, integration with renewables, operating costs, and potential design improvements, among other aspects. This data will be essential for guiding future investments in commercial plants.

With this combination of Technological innovation, European funding and a territorial approachCIUDEN places Cubillos del Sil on the European map of applied research in sustainable fuels for aviation and other energy-intensive uses, opening the door to new industrial developments linked to green hydrogen and the use of residual biomass.",https://www.meteorologiaenred.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CIUDEN-planta-piloto-de-combustible-sostenible-para-aviacion.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 06:56:34.912369

With 158 million litres already consumed, the remaining need is 119 million litres.
The UK’s SAF market is entering a pivotal stage.
The UK’s SAF policy is achieving its goal — prompting real uptake, strengthening the market and signalling producers to expand capacity.","The UK’s transition toward Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is gathering pace, and the impact is now visible in the market as prices climb sharply, reports ResourceWise Blog.

The Department for Transport (DfT) has released the second edition of its provisional 2025 SAF report, offering the most detailed view so far of how obligated suppliers are progressing toward this year’s targets. The update, which includes data up to mid-September, outlines trends in jet fuel demand, SAF usage, fuel sources and the technologies used to produce SAF. Although the numbers are provisional, they remain the most reliable gauge of the UK’s progress toward meeting the 2% SAF blending requirement.

By mid-September, the UK had consumed 158 million litres of SAF. While this suggests steady growth, it still falls short of what is required for full compliance.

A true measure of progress requires comparing SAF consumption with three key metrics: fossil jet fuel usage, actual blending rates and mandated blend levels.

So far this year, only one reporting period has surpassed the 2% blending requirement. The national average blending rate stands at 1.63%, well below the target. With the year nearing its end, suppliers now face mounting pressure to close the gap — and that pressure is shaping market behaviour.

Throughout the previous year, SAF prices hovered around USD 1,800 per tonne. Beginning in July, however, prices surged from the steady USD 1,800 level to above USD 2,900 per tonne. This jump reflects the last-minute rush by obligated parties that postponed SAF procurement earlier in the year and are now working urgently to meet blending requirements.

The financial impact is significant:

A 2% blend at USD 1,800/t cost roughly USD 36/t.

At today’s prices above USD 2,900/t, the cost rises to about USD 58/t.

The USD 22/t difference is due entirely to timing, a major burden for an industry where profit margins are often very narrow.

The trend underscores the need for better planning. Delayed purchasing is proving costly for suppliers.

UK Still Needs 119 Million Litres of SAF This Year

A clearer picture of the supply gap emerges when projecting full-year jet fuel use:

Jet fuel consumed so far: 9.83 billion litres

Estimated consumption for the remainder of the year: 4.02 billion litres

Total projected 2025 consumption: 13.849 billion litres

A 2% SAF mandate requires 277 million litres of SAF for 2025. With 158 million litres already consumed, the remaining need is 119 million litres.

This means that 43% of the entire annual requirement must be supplied in the last 29% of the year — a key driver behind the current price spike.

The UK’s SAF market is entering a pivotal stage. Usage is increasing, mandates are tightening and suppliers are still adjusting to the new compliance landscape.

Prices are climbing not because supply has collapsed, but because demand is now concentrated in a compressed timeframe as parties try to meet the mandate before the year ends. As long as this pattern continues, price volatility is likely to persist.

However, the broader significance is clear: rising prices reflect rising demand. The UK’s SAF policy is achieving its goal — prompting real uptake, strengthening the market and signalling producers to expand capacity.

The key question now is whether suppliers will change their procurement strategies in time for the next compliance cycle.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-2.png,N,,2025-11-27 07:57:06.162661

Jurong Island is Singapore’s flagship energy and chemicals hub. And it is marking its 25th anniversary with a sweeping set of initiatives designed to reposition the island for a low-carbon future. Why is this important to CleanTechnica readers? Simply because despite all our desire for renewable energy, the path leading to that is to “defossil-fuelize” ourselves. And Jurong Island is a grounded and well thought of approach.

CleanTechnica visited Jurong Island in April 2024 and saw how the reclaimed island once defined by petrochemicals and refining is now being reimagined as one of Asia’s most ambitious testbeds for decarbonization technologies — including hydrogen, ammonia, microgrids, sustainable data centers, and advanced specialty-chemicals production.

Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong, speaking at the Jurong Island 25th Anniversary Dinner, witnessed the signing of six new partnerships involving global companies, government agencies, universities, and climate-tech solution providers. The agreements reflect Singapore’s effort to turn an industrial zone built for the fossil-fuel age into a proving ground for climate-aligned manufacturing.

A shift from hydrocarbons to higher-value, lower-carbon industries

When Jurong Island officially opened in 2000 after a massive land-reclamation program, Singapore’s goal was clear: anchor multinational petrochemical companies and build an integrated chemicals value chain. The model worked. Over 100 global firms now operate on the island, and the energy and chemicals industry remains a cornerstone of Singapore’s manufacturing sector.

But the global energy landscape is changing. Petrochemical demand is under pressure, plastics are facing regulation, and industrial emissions are coming under increasingly strict scrutiny. Singapore’s response is to pivot the island toward specialty chemicals, sustainable materials, and next-generation fuels — sectors with higher value and lower carbon intensity.

According to JTC and the Economic Development Board, specialty-chemicals investments in manufacturing and R&D are expected to deliver more than 1,000 new jobs. Meanwhile, nearly 300 hectares have been designated for new-energy infrastructure — including hydrogen production, ammonia storage and handling, sustainable aviation fuel pathways, and advanced battery systems.

For a country with limited land, devoting this much space to next-generation energy is a signal: Singapore sees Jurong Island not just as an industrial district, but as a platform for its national energy transition.

Testbeds as a competitive advantage

Three of the newly announced partnerships center on experimental platforms that allow companies to prove, validate, and scale low-carbon technologies under real operating conditions.

The Sustainable Tropical Data Center Testbed is among the most notable. JTC and the National University of Singapore are preparing to launch Phase 2 of the testbed, located directly on Jurong Island. With AI workloads straining power grids worldwide, Singapore is planning a 700-MW low-carbon data center park on the island. The testbed will allow operators to pilot immersion cooling, direct-chip cooling, smart energy-management systems, and AI-optimized workload distribution — all critical for reducing heat and energy use in a tropical environment.

Another major effort is A*STAR’s Low Carbon Technology Translational Testbed (LCT3), developed with Surbana Jurong. LCT3 will provide a turnkey environment for piloting industrial decarbonization solutions — from carbon-capture systems to low-emission thermal processes — with the engineering support needed to move from experimentation to commercial deployment.

Singapore is also planning a renewable-energy microgrid testbed in collaboration with Keppel. This system will explore advanced demand-response controls as well as thermal-energy networks capable of redistributing cooling loads across multiple industrial facilities — an approach that could reduce overall electricity demand significantly.

Hydrogen is the spotlight

Aster announced one of the most significant industrial investments: a SG$195 million (US$150 million) hydrogen-ready integrated gas turbine for its Jurong Island facility. The turbine will allow Aster to generate its own low-carbon electricity and export surplus to Singapore’s national grid.

Aster also signed an MOU with Air Liquide to explore producing low-carbon hydrogen using auto-thermal reforming (ATR) paired with carbon capture. ATR is one of the few commercially viable pathways capable of achieving high capture rates — a key requirement if hydrogen is to play a meaningful role in Singapore’s energy system.

Singapore’s National Hydrogen Strategy identifies hydrogen and hydrogen-derived fuels as long-term options for power generation, heavy industry, aviation, and maritime bunkering. Domestic production will not replace imports, but it could become an important complement, especially for industrial users on Jurong Island.

Startups, talent needed in industrial decarbonization

In a move that differentiates Jurong Island from traditional industrial parks, JTC is partnering with Third Derivative (D3), a global climate-tech accelerator supported by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI). The collaboration will connect more than 280 cleantech startups with large industrial players on Jurong Island.

For startups developing technologies that need industrial-scale testing, access to Jurong Island’s infrastructure could be transformative. For industry players, the partnership creates a pipeline of early-stage innovation that can be tested and adapted quickly.

Singapore’s strategy recognizes that new infrastructure is only as effective as the workforce that operates it. JTC and NUS are co-developing training modules, internships, and a potential specialization in industrial decarbonization and sustainable digital infrastructure to prepare future engineers and technicians.

Advario Singapore will work with Workforce Singapore to redesign roles and upskill 150 employees for handling emerging fuels such as ammonia — a critical capability as global shipping lines explore ammonia-powered propulsion.

A new blueprint for industrial regions worldwide

As older energy and chemicals hubs in the United States, Europe, and Asia grapple with decarbonization, Singapore is turning Jurong Island into a showcase of what a coordinated industrial transition can look like. Singapore is also looking at nuclear energy in its mix, because currently it generates 95% of its electricity from natural gas. And less than 3% of its energy comes from renewable source, particularly solar. The island nation is, however, actively expanding its solar capacity and plans to import wind energy from Vietnam, solar from Vietnam, and hydropower from Malaysia.

Wednesday, 26 November 2025 - 11:00 AM

The Australian Government co-hosted two Women Peace and Security (WPS) activities with Vietnam in Hanoi last week as part of Indo-Pacific Endeavour 2025.

Representatives from Australia’s Department of Defence and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade met with the Vietnam People’s Army to share experiences in a bilateral seminar on implementing a Women Peace and Security National Action Plan.

Together, Australia and Vietnam then co-hosted a minilateral Women Peace and Security seminar with participants from Cambodia, Laos and UN Women, as well as observers from Canada, Japan and New Zealand. The seminar focused on enabling activities for the full and meaningful participation of women in peace processes, including the consideration of effective recruitment and retention policies, as well as employing gender advisors.

Head of the visiting Australian delegation, Colonel Karen Such, said this year marked 25 years since the adoption of the UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 on Women, Peace and Security.

UNSCR 1325 recognises the disproportionate impact of conflict on women and girls, and affirms the vital role women play in preventing conflict, building peace and supporting recovery efforts.

“Despite progress since Resolution 1325, the transformative potential of WPS remains underrealised. As such, it was incredibly meaningful to see Australia and Vietnam collaborate to continue to push the boundaries of WPS in a regional context,” Colonel Such said.

Australia is grateful to Vietnam for hosting these important seminars and greatly values working with Vietnam to build a more inclusive, peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.

Aviation safety on the agenda in Thailand

Wednesday, 19 November 2025 - 15:30 PM

A Mobile Training Team from the Australian Defence Aviation Safety Authority recently completed a three-day Aviation Safety Training Seminar in Bangkok, Thailand.

The four-member team from the Education and Training Directorate delivered a tailored program on topics designed to strengthen bilateral engagement and aviation safety knowledge as part of Indo-Pacific Endeavour 25 (IPE25).

Participants included representatives from all three services of the Royal Thai military, with ranks ranging from group captain to pilot officer.

Key subjects covered included aviation safety management systems, human factors, aviation risk management, data collection and analysis, and the aviation safety investigation process.

Seminar lead Major Andrew Jones said air safety in the region was becoming increasingly important as regional partners expanded capabilities within complex environments to meet the needs of self-defence, as well as providing support to humanitarian and disaster response activities.

“With this increased capability comes a need for increased interoperability as partnerships and coalitions meet the needs of the Indo-Pacific region,” Major Jones said.

“It was a great opportunity to introduce the way the Australian Defence Force approaches aviation safety and share some of our lessons learned.

“It was also a great opportunity to network with our partners in the region on an increasingly important and complex area of work.”

Deputy Defence Attaché at the Australian Embassy in Bangkok Wing Commander Fernando Lay said it was fantastic to see the Australian contingent in Thailand engaging with counterparts.

“Indo-Pacific Endeavour’s Aviation Safety Seminar continues to strengthen bonds between Australian and Thailand while sharing expertise to enhance collective aviation safety knowledge,” he said.

Collaborate to innovate

Wednesday, 5 November 2025 - 14:16 PM

As part of Indo-Pacific Endeavour 2025, the ADF Drone Racing Team showed off their exciting sport and spoke about defence innovation through uncrewed systems programs at the Malaysian Ministry of Defence (Kementerian Pertahanan Malaysia).

Team leader, Squadron Leader Josh Vicino, touched on the importance of adaptability and innovation in defence and associated industries to meet new challenges.

An active ADF reservist working in the defence industry, Squadron Leader Vicino is a qualified electronics engineer who is helping to build the next generation of airborne intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platforms.

“Our security and prosperity relies on creative, curious and innovative people thinking outside the box,” Squadron Leader Vicino said.

“Security challenges evolve rapidly, and technology refresh cycles are getting shorter and shorter. We need to out-think and out-pace our adversaries.”

On the sidelines of the drone display, Australian officials met with representatives of STRIDE, the Malaysian Defence Science & Technology Research Institute.

This engagement paves the way for collaboration between Australia and Malaysia’s defence research, design and manufacturing sectors.

“We look forward to working closely with our Australian friends,” a Malaysian Ministry of Defence spokesman said.

“Our people are smart, creative and committed to protecting the stability of our region. Together they can achieve great things.”

Indo-Pacific Endeavour Chief of Staff, Group Captain Steven Henry, said drone racing was a fantastic way to introduce people to the exciting world of uncrewed systems and STEM activities.

“The ADF Drone Racing Team have put on a fantastic display and energised our conversations around innovation with our Malaysian counterparts,” he said.

Maintaining a secure region at the Oceans Dialogue in Vietnam

Monday, 27 October 2025 - 12:16 PM

The Indo-Pacific Endeavour Program sent a delegate from the National Security and Resilience Branch to Hanoi to participate in the Sixth Vietnam-Australia Oceans Dialogue.

Department of Defence delegate Louis Polkinghorne said the Dialogue provided a great opportunity to discuss strategic developments in the Indo-Pacific region and South China Sea, as well as our bilateral Australia-Vietnam maritime security cooperation.

The Dialogue provided the opportunity to find common ground on opportunities to strengthen peace and stability in the region, including through upholding international law and the freedom of navigation. Levering these opportunities would enable Australia and Vietnam to further strengthen the bilateral relationship and promote transparency and cooperation between the two countries.

It was refreshing to see like-minded representatives sharing their concerns about escalating national security risks in the maritime space. Vietnam was eager to exchange experiences with Australia and learn about Australia’s resilience-based approaches to protect undersea cables, Mr Polkinghorne said.

“I was impressed with attendees’ openness and willingness to discuss contemporary maritime security challenges in the South China Sea and honoured to work with a trusted international partner,” he said.

“It’s been a real privilege to be involved in this dialogue and see firsthand how person-to-person connection drives diplomacy efforts to maintain our peaceful and prosperous region.”

IPE hosts delegates from across the region

Tuesday, 21 October 2025 - 15:00 PM

The Indo-Pacific Endeavour (IPE) program was pleased to host South-East Asian delegations for the Australasian Military Medicine Association (AMMA) Conference in Adelaide.

Nineteen representatives from Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam converged on the Adelaide Convention Centre from October 17-19.

Major General Nishat Jubaida, the only female two-star general in the Bangladesh Army, said she was delighted to see female representation among senior leadership across the many nations represented at the AMMA conference.

Senior medical officers from each nation attending the conference held talks with ADF Surgeon General Rear Admiral Sonya Bennett.

Delegates also joined the AMMA program in specialised workshops that aligned with their respective medical specialisations.

Lieutenant Wan Nurul Naszeerah, from the Royal Brunei Land Forces, presented her research titled Listening to the Force – which uses artificial intelligence to categorise sentiment in health communications – at the conference.

In addition to military health personnel, the AMMA audience included civilian medical providers, contractors, state and federal health officials and emergency services personnel and academics.

The visiting IPE delegations were supported by IPE personnel and joined other host officers from the ADF’s Joint Health Command who have experience working alongside military health experts in South-East Asian nations.

Having deployed to Vietnam on IPE earlier this year, Captain Brendan Nguyen, a psychologist from 3rd Health Battalion, was on hand to assist the Vietnamese delegation alongside fellow Vietnamese-Australian Major Jacob Choi. Both members said it was a privilege to host officers from their parents’ country of birth, giving them a sense of meaningful purpose.

Developing a peacekeeping capability

Friday, 17 October 2025 - 15:30 PM

The Indo-Pacific Endeavour (IPE) program brought a delegation from the Lao People’s Army to Canberra to observe UN-accredited peace operations training, supporting Laos’ interest in developing its peacekeeping capability.

Department of Defence policy advisor to IPE25, Jordan Anderton, said the visit gave the delegation valuable insights into how Australia conducts UN-accredited training at the Peace Operations Training Centre (POTC).

The delegation watched participants from Thailand, the Philippines and Timor-Leste undertaking the United Nations Staff Officer Course and UN Military Observer Course at the Majura Range Training Area.

Ms Anderton said the simulated learning allowed the delegation to see role players in scenarios drawn from real UN missions, and Australia’s unique approach to preparing students for UN peacekeeping operations.

“Students learn how to conduct the [UN Military Decision-Making Process] UN MDMP and planning for activities for a UN mission. They also use a [simulation] SIM virtual vehicle patrol and avatar, simulating a military observer patrol and interactions with local people,” she said.

The program is a mandated peacekeeper observer’s course that prepares ADF and international personnel for the complexities of UN peacekeeping missions.

Participants were tested on critical skills including negotiation, mediation and dispute resolution, all under simulated operational conditions.

“The delegation was impressed with the training and said that the course appeared to prepare its participants to meet the complex situations and challenges of being deployed on a UN mission,” Ms Anderton said.

“It was great to have Lao representatives visit us and observe our courses. This visit is a concrete example of our growing Defence relationship with the Lao People’s Army.”

Strengthening people-to-people links through IPE25

Wednesday, 8 October 2025 - 16:00 PM

Australian Defence Adviser to Sri Lanka and Maldives Colonel Amanda Johnston reflects on IPE25 conducting knowledge exchanges in the north-east Indian Ocean:

Hot on the heels of a high-level visit by our Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Richard Marles to Sri Lanka and Maldives, Australian Defence Force personnel were back in the north-east Indian Ocean region to exchange knowledge and build people-to-people links through Indo-Pacific Endeavour (IPE) 2025.

Australia’s 2024 National Defence Strategy highlighted the strategic importance of the north-east Indian Ocean and directed increased defence engagement with countries like Sri Lanka and Maldives. IPE is a practical symbol of the deepening defence relationships with both.

In Sri Lanka, IPE included a number of different activities, all focused on knowledge-sharing. Army Engineers from the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment visited Sri Lanka’s School of Military Engineering for a workshop on humanitarian demining and search operations, while ADF personnel were embedded in a US-led multilateral exercise, Pacific Angel, to participate in subject matter expert exchanges in military medicine, mass casualty evacuation, aeromedical evacuation, and combat search and rescue operations.

Additionally, Australia led a bilateral knowledge exchange focused on maritime surveillance using the former-RAAF KA350 aircraft that Australia gifted to Sri Lanka in 2024. In a neat twist, RAAF Squadron Leader Glenn Canfield, who delivered the KA350 to Sri Lanka last October, returned to the island for a professional exchange with Sri Lanka Air Force’s 3 (Maritime) Squadron. The Sri Lanka Air Force pilots were thrilled to have the chance to pick Squadron Leader Canfield’s brain on everything about the aircraft and its maritime surveillance role.

Across the Laccadive Sea, ADF personnel also visited the Maldives for workshops focused on human capital. Royal Australian Navy Chaplain Mogamat Majidih Essa reached ‘celebrity imam’ status delivering televised Friday prayers and leading several command sessions in mental health and wellbeing, while staff from the Indo-Pacific Centre for Military Law and ADF workforce modellers guided Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) staff through discussions on their respective areas.

Commander IPE Brigadier Jen Harris also visited the Maldives and met with senior MNDF leaders and hosted a gender, peace and security forum.

As the only named activity on the ADF calendar for both countries, IPE is a key engagement activity that enables us to pursue specific National Defence Strategy objectives, in particular raising the visibility of the ADF in the north-east Indian Ocean and deepening the people-to-people links. IPE is a practical symbol of our deepening defence relationships with north-east Indian Ocean countries and demonstrates Australia’s commitment to a safer and more secure maritime backyard.

We look forward to IPE26!

Engaging with counterparts in Cambodia

Monday, 29 September 2025 - 12:00 PM

ADF personnel from the Indo-Pacific Endeavour (IPE) program and the Defence Section from the Australian Embassy to Cambodia visited the Multi-National Training Centre at Ream Naval Base, Cambodia, to collaborate with Royal Cambodian Navy personnel on maritime security and military diving capabilities.

Lieutenant Colonel Paul Henry, who led the IPE contingent, said it was great to be back in Cambodia, connecting with colleagues and workshopping ideas to develop capabilities in particular areas of mutual interest.

“Our team was accompanied by Australian Ambassador to Cambodia, H.E. Derek Yip, and we were fortunate to meet with the Commander of Ream Naval Base, Rear Admiral Mey Dina, to discuss IPE support to the Royal Cambodian Navy in the areas of maritime law, maritime security, and development of a military diving capability,” Lieutenant Colonel Henry said.

The team also met with the Commander of the National Committee for Maritime Security Tactical Headquarters, Rear Admiral Ly Huot, to discuss future collaboration on naval interdiction and military diving training for members of the Royal Cambodian Navy.

“The Royal Cambodian Navy has a strong interest in enhancing its capabilities in these specialist fields. We will continue to engage in this area, including considering providing Cambodia with diving equipment,” Lieutenant Colonel Henry said.

“Australia is keen to collaborate with our neighbours in the Indo-Pacific region on improving maritime security and our collective ability to respond to maritime security events, including on humanitarian and disaster relief operations.”

While in Cambodia, the IPE team also visited the Institute for Peacekeeping, Mine Clearance and ERW (IPMEC) in Phnom Penh.

The team discussed future collaboration with Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) personnel on training Cambodian peacekeepers for UN operations, including the Comprehensive Protection of Civilians, Gender Peace and Security, and English language training.

ADF personnel also met with a number of RCAF students currently undergoing training courses at IPMEC. The RCAF has a long history of involvement in peacekeeping operations, with more than 10,000 RCAF members deploying as peacekeepers since 2006.

Cambodia is one of 13 countries in the Indo-Pacific region that IPE will travel to this year to participate in workshops, engagements and knowledge exchanges. IPE aims to strengthen Australia’s regional relationships and build on trusted partnerships that have been developed and nurtured since the IPE program began in 2017.

Strengthening partnerships across the Indo-Pacific

Monday, 22 September 2025 - 15:30 PM

An update from Commander IPE Jen Harris:

Australia’s Indo-Pacific Endeavour (IPE) program is in full swing, with September seeing engagements across the breadth of the region. Teams travelled to the north-east Indian Ocean, renewing valued friendships in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Closer to home, we have been catching up with colleagues in Brunei and Timor-Leste.

In Sri Lanka, we have focused on maritime surveillance, search and rescue, military medicine and military engineering. IPE activities were designed to complement the regional multinational activity Pacific Angel, co-hosted by the Sri Lanka Air Force and the US Air Force. Pacific Angel focuses on humanitarian and disaster relief, and our teams undertook valuable training in emergency medical and evacuation procedures.

People were central to the program in the Maldives this year, working together to develop workforce modelling capability, and sharing knowledge and experience in military justice and gender, peace and security. A highlight was the return of Royal Australian Navy Chaplain Imam Mogamat Essa, who led faith-based engagements focused on the spiritual wellbeing and mental resilience of our forces.

In Brunei, IPE coincided with the 80th anniversary commemorations for Australia’s Operation Oboe landings for the liberation of Borneo. Australia and Brunei Darussalam enjoy a longstanding defence partnership stretching back to World War 2. Unique to this year, IPE ran concurrent with Exercise Penguin, a biennial maritime security exercise between our two nations. A Royal Australian Air Force P-8A Poseidon and Royal Australian Navy Anzac-class frigate HMAS Ballarat supported the exercise. These two parallel programs represent the breadth and depth of the relationship

During the week of IPE activities, Australian and Bruneian participants exchanged knowledge in the areas of defensive cyber, military law and workforce planning. Flight Lieutenant Imam Abdul Kader made his fifth visit to Brunei. During a five-day religious engagement program, Imam Kader delivered a presentation on emotional intelligence to youth leaders, providing practical demonstrations of the support chaplains provide in the field.

At the core of all these engagements are people-to-people connections, reinforcing the latticework of trusted partnerships that characterise this region we call home. We have seen the power of dialogue and knowledge sharing firsthand, especially when founded on mutual respect and understanding. It has been a true privilege to play a small part in the incredible work our Defence and whole of Australian Government colleagues do every day to cultivate these partnerships. Thank you.

IPE25 trilateral English Language Teacher Training strengthens ties

Tuesday, 9 September 2025 - 12:30 PM

Commander IPE25 Brigadier Jennifer Harris reflects on her visit to Hanoi this week for the opening of the English Language Teacher Training program:

It’s an absolute privilege to be in Hanoi this week, representing the Australian Defence Force and the Indo-Pacific Endeavour Program, to open this year’s English Language Teacher Training program.

Teachers from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia will undertake a week of intensive teacher training.

Australian language specialists from the Defence International Training Centre, Captain Jen Hackney and Mr Chris Wilkinson, will deliver the training.

Indo-Pacific Endeavour, Australia’s flagship regional engagement activity, is pleased to be back at Vietnam’s Foreign Relations Department, continuing our enduring collaboration with our friends from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.

This annual training is a testament to the strength of our partnerships and our shared commitment to a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region – where state sovereignty is protected, international law is followed and nations can make decisions free from coercion.

We are proud to support this training package, investing in teachers, our greatest knowledge sharers. The investment you will make in the next five days will enhance our respective language capability, but also deepens the people-to-people links that are at the heart of our defence cooperation, building relationships founded on openness and mutual respect.

In a world of many languages, English continues to play a central role in facilitating multinational cooperation, peacekeeping operations and joint military exercises. English language teachers are essential to enabling stronger collaboration and enhancing mutual understanding across borders.

This year marks the fourth year of this training program, which has become a key feature of the Indo-Pacific Endeavour Program. Our sincere thanks to the Foreign Relations Department, which continues to host this important activity. Each iteration builds on the last, strengthening our shared capacity and reinforcing the bonds of friendship and trust between our nations.

The Australian Defence Force values the opportunity to work alongside our regional partners in building skills that support not only military effectiveness but also broader regional stability. Thank you to all the teachers and the trainers for the continued investment you make every day in building our future leaders.

Together, we are building a stronger, more connected Indo-Pacific.

Alon and Keris Woomera evolve into major military exercises

Wednesday, 3 September 2025 - 12:00 PM

Commander IPE 2025 Brigadier Jennifer Harris was in the Philippines last week for the final stages of Exercise Alon 25. The exercise saw approximately 1600 Australia Defence Force personnel deployed abroad in the Indo-Pacific Region, the largest commitment in nearly 20 years.

Since first being conducted as an amphibious landing activity with the Philippine Marines in 2023, Exercise Alon 25 has evolved to encompass comprehensive cooperation between the ADF and all services of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).

Brigadier Harris said it was impressive to witness multi-domain cooperation between the ADF and the AFP, across air, land, maritime and special operations taskforces and elements, supported by Space and Cyber components.

“Exercise Alon grew out of Australia’s Indo-Pacific Endeavour (IPE) Program. This year’s iteration exemplifies the incredible growth in our partnership and it now stands alone as a key biennial joint activity between Australia and the Philippines,” she said.

Around 3600 personnel trained together between August 15 and 29 at locations around the islands of Palawan and Luzon.

This year’s Exercise Alon also included participation by the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ville de Québec, and the United States Marine Corps’ Marine Rotation Force – Darwin, which included MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft.

Exercise Alon is a biennial activity. In the alternate year, the ADF and the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) train together in Exercise Keris Woomera, deepening bonds and military interoperability.

“It is impressive to see how the foundation laid by IPE has supported the growth and evolution of these two major standalone activities embedded into the training schedules of each country. Alon and Keris Woomera were Australia’s largest overseas military exercises in 2024 and 25,” Brigadier Harris said.

“These significant training activities successfully demonstrate Australia’s ability to force project into our region to support our key regional partners.”

The joint exercises not only improve military skills, demonstrate enhanced interoperability and strengthen defence diplomacy between participating countries – they build a spirit of mutual trust and are important steps in building strong cooperation to maintain regional stability.

Focus on resilience at regional security forum in Brisbane

Wednesday, 20 August 2025 - 15:30 PM

The IPE team was represented at the 2025 Indo-Pacific Environmental Security Forum (IPESF) in Brisbane last week.

Chief of Staff Group Captain Steve Henry led the team in welcoming counterparts from Bangladesh to the forum who were keen to discuss sustainable fuels as part of a broader collaboration with the Defence Energy Transition Office (DETO).

The overarching theme of the four-day conference was operational resilience. Day one focused on disaster resilience and how partnerships strengthen collective responses to disasters. Day two was focused on energy resilience during disasters. Day three was about systems thinking, community resilience and conflict prevention. Day four culminated in discussions and presentations around strategic partnerships and capability sharing.

Attending the conference, Squadron Leader Robert Bride said it brought together military and civilian agencies and regional experts from 21 countries to discuss non-traditional security threats, including lack of disaster preparedness; energy insecurity; climate-related environmental impacts; illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; water insecurity; and energy transition, solutions and best practices.

The forum provided an invaluable opportunity to better understand emerging solutions and best practice in responding to these challenges.

“The IPESF is unique in that it brings military and civilian discussions to the forefront and showcases the need to have a whole-of-stakeholder approach to addressing disasters, oil spills, water scarcity, climate migration challenges, energy insecurity and other environmental security threats,” Squadron Leader Bride said.

Environmental security can be broadly defined as countering vulnerabilities caused by the abundance or scarcity of environmental resources and/or degradation.

“The IPESF provides an opportunity for civilian entities to gain a better understanding of the important work that militaries do to reduce risks to national security, better identify and map the military and civilian nexus, and for Defence forces to learn about innovative solutions that industry and educational institutions are implementing to combat the same or similar environmental security challenges,” Squadron Leader Bride said.

The Center for Excellence in Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance (CFE-DM), United States Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) and Australian Defence Force, in partnership with the New Zealand Defence Force and the New Zealand Ministry of Defence, coordinated the 14th annual forum.

The organization noted that jet fuel purchases are “almost always paid in dollars,” making currency movements a direct operational concern for carriers across multiple regions.
IATA highlighted that the divergence between fuel price declines and operating costs has been evident for a decade.
The group reported that the volatility of jet fuel prices in dollars “has intensified since 2020,” driven by the pandemic-related collapse in demand, supply-chain disruptions during the recovery, and ongoing geopolitical tensions.
IATA stated that 55%–60% of global airline costs are denominated in dollars, compared with only 50%–55% of revenues.","The depreciation of local currencies against the US dollar has become a key factor shaping airline cost structures, according to new analysis from the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The organization noted that jet fuel purchases are “almost always paid in dollars,” making currency movements a direct operational concern for carriers across multiple regions.

IATA highlighted that the divergence between fuel price declines and operating costs has been evident for a decade. The group reported that the volatility of jet fuel prices in dollars “has intensified since 2020,” driven by the pandemic-related collapse in demand, supply-chain disruptions during the recovery, and ongoing geopolitical tensions.

The most pronounced impacts are being felt in Russia and Brazil. IATA attributed Russia’s exposure to the weakening ruble following the invasion of Ukraine and to sanctions that “have limited the price of Russian oil since 2022.” Brazil, meanwhile, has faced currency pressure as markets anticipate monetary easing while the country continues to manage “persistent fiscal issues and the negative impact of tariffs on the balance of payments.”

IATA added that the European Union, China and India have also seen depreciation against the dollar since mid-2022, albeit to a lesser extent. It noted that the dollar has fallen “about 10% against many currencies this year,” helping reduce fuel bills for carriers whose domestic currencies strengthened during that period.

Fuel accounts for about 26% of airline operating costs. IATA stated that 55%–60% of global airline costs are denominated in dollars, compared with only 50%–55% of revenues. This imbalance means currency appreciation or depreciation has a direct impact on margins. According to the association, a 1% appreciation of the dollar against other currencies can reduce operating margins by “about 0.1 percentage points,” while a 1% depreciation can improve margins by a similar amount.

IATA’s August 2025 data shows the average jet fuel barrel at “about US$86 this year, compared with US$99 in 2024,” yielding “an estimated US$25 billion in global savings.” The association linked the drop to the dollar’s depreciation in several markets and a modest increase in SAF output, which currently represents “0.7% of total consumption” and is expected to “double its share in 2025.”

IATA noted that some airlines have “cut their losses by half in the first quarter,” helped by lower fuel costs and stable demand. Analysts cautioned, however, that the outlook remains sensitive to conflicts, supply-chain constraints, rising labor and maintenance costs, and delays in fleet renewal that could heighten exposure to future energy price swings.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-11/R%20%286%29.jpg?h=e3a8e1e1&itok=5j8KOdwt,N,,2025-11-26 19:56:37.985030

On this podcast, we bring you the latest reports from the GPB newsroom. On today's episode, the election interference case against President Donald Trump and others has been dismissed. A new study details the risk of sea level rise to Georgia's coast. And ahead of the final series of Stranger Things, an Airbnb in Fayetteville gives guests a unique and immersive experience tied to the popular series.

Alejandro Choza: I mean, ultimately, it's them that get excited about the property and they love to visit and we hope to do a lot of cool stuff over the next coming years.

Orlando Montoya: Today is Wednesday, Nov. 26, the day before Thanksgiving. I'm Orlando Montoya and this is Georgia Today.

Story 1:

Orlando Montoya: Georgia prosecutor Pete Skandalakis is dropping the state's election interference case against President Donald Trump and other defendants. In a court filing this morning, Skandalakis said he did not find clear evidence that there was a viable conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Georgia State University law professor Anthony Michael Kreis says momentum was against the case and he isn't surprised by the decision.

Anthony Michael Kreis: I think this is really, fundamentally, a gut check about whether you believe the president of the United States tried to overturn the 2020 election or not.

Orlando Montoya: Trump and 18 co-defendants were indicted in 2023, but the case was plagued by challenges, including the removal of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis as prosecutor. With the charges dropped, a judge quickly dismissed the case today, ending a multi-year saga and the last effort to prosecute Trump for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.

Story 2:

Orlando Montoya: Atlanta's Fulton County is preparing for the 2026 point in time or PIT count of unhoused people. GPB's Amanda Andrews reports leaders of the county's continuum of care, or COC, are looking for volunteers to help.

Amanda Andrews: The COC includes local officials and service providers. They use the PIT count to identify service gaps in Fulton County. This year, they identified 241 individuals who were unsheltered, which was a decrease from 2024. But they say challenges, including weather, likely caused an undercount. Maggie Goldman leads the effort. She says this time they're considering running an additional survey.

Maggie Goldman: It appears that the point-in-time count data does not stay with us directly to act on. And we'd like to make sure that the people that we touch are able to get some kind of follow-up through either a coordinate entry or another available group.

Amanda Andrews: The Fulton County PIT count takes place Jan. 22 and 23rd. Volunteers can sign up online. For GPB News, I'm Amanda Andrews.

Story 3:

Orlando Montoya: A Georgia foster care advocacy group held a Thanksgiving dinner last week for young adults who recently aged out of the foster care system. GPB's Sarah Kallis has that story.

Sarah Kallis: At the Fostering Success Act dinner, former foster children ages 18 to 26 enjoyed a sit-down dinner with waiters and heard from Jackson Health CEO, Rick Jackson, who is a former foster child himself. Fostering Success Act executive director Heidi Carr says the dinner helped attendees learn life skills that may have been otherwise hard for them to practice.

Heidi Carr: Just all the things that many of us really — maybe we weren't sat down and taught, but we got to witness through how our parents interact with others.

Sarah Kallis: Fostering Success Act is a nonprofit that provides resources to youth that have aged out of the foster care system and helps them access jobs, housing and college scholarships. For GPB News, I'm Sarah Kallis.

Story 4:

Orlando Montoya: Political and religious leaders are mourning the death of one of the most politically influential Black ministers in Georgia for many years. From 2016 to 2024, African Methodist Episcopal Bishop Reginald Jackson presided over more than 400 Georgia congregations before moving to a new post serving the church in the Washington, D.C., area. His family announced his unexpected death in a social media post today. Over the years, Jackson organized boycotts and rallies for progressive causes, supported Democratic candidates, and pushed church members to vote, as well as leading various religious and educational institutions. Words of condolence poured in today from Georgia Democrats, including U.S. Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff and Atlanta congresswoman Nikema Williams. Bishop Reginald Jackson was 71 years old.

Story 5:

Orlando Montoya: A new study published in the journal Nature Communications details the risks of sea level rise to industrial facilities, including those on Georgia's coast. GPB's Chase McGee has more.

Chase McGee: Researchers found around one dozen industrial production and defense facilities in Coastal Georgia at risk of flooding by 2050 in its best-case scenario, including sites in Savannah and Brunswick. Dr. Sacoby Wilson is a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. He outlines the risks these industrial and production sites can pose should they be flooded.

Dr. Sacoby Wilson: You have both short-term effects to chemical and microbial contaminants in the flood waters and also long-term effects in flood. And let me not forget mold, of course. So for those who are going back after the event, could be exposed to mold that could also have a respiratory effect.

Chase McGee: The study recommends better disaster planning and mitigation strategies to reduce the risk of harm posed to people. For GPB News, I'm Chase McGee.

Story 6:

Orlando Montoya: State transportation officials have awarded $24 million in federal funding to expand Georgia's network of charging stations for electric vehicles. The State Department of Transportation last week announced six winning bidders for 26 new stations on interstates and highways across Georgia. This was the second round of funding from the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a priority during the Joe Biden administration.

Story 7:

Orlando Montoya: The Netflix original series Stranger Things is back today for its final season. It's a milestone for both fans and Georgia's entertainment industry. The show features now-iconic locations across the state. GPB's Sofi Gratas takes us to one of them.

Sofi Gratas: A flickering '80s-style TV welcomes you to the Airbnb in suburban Fayetteville, the actual home of characters Joyce, Jonathan, and Will Byers from Stranger Things. Guests can play Dungeons and Dragons.

I don't know how to play.

Painted on the wall: an alphabet, lined by rainbow Christmas lights. Twisted vines in a red-lit hallway mimic the ""Upside Down"" from the show. In a bedroom on the left, there's a record player, teed up with canon music from the TV show, like this song by Kate Bush.

Alejandro Choza: For me, it's like going in and listening to some records in Jonathan's room, that's my favorite part.

Sofi Gratas: Alejandro Choza is a real estate investor who bought the Byers home in 2022. He says it took over a year to style, but since then, thousands of fans have bought shares to own a piece of the property. Choza hopes they and other guests will keep the house busy long after the series finale.

Alejandro Choza: I mean, ultimately it's them that get excited about the property and they love to visit and we hope to do a lot of cool stuff over the next coming years.

Sofi Gratas: The Byers House is currently booked through April of next year. For GPB News, I'm Sofi Gratas.

Story 8:

Orlando Montoya: Jet fuel maker LanzaJet has begun commercial-scale production of sustainable aviation fuel from ethanol at its facility in Middle Georgia's Trutland County. The company this month said the milestone was the world's first non-oil-based renewable jet fuel compatible with today's aircraft and the culmination of 15 years of research and development. Federal aviation officials hope the production becomes a model for a new wave of sustainable aviation fuel or SAF. LanzaJet and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport shared more than $3 million in Federal Aviation Administration grants announced last year to help deploy SAF.

Story 9:

Orlando Montoya: Federal workplace safety officials have fined three companies nearly $27,000 for violations that contributed to the death of a worker at the Hyundai vehicle plant in Southeast Georgia. The worker died in a gruesome forklift incident days before the plant's grand opening in March.

Story 10:

Orlando Montoya: Tomorrow, families all over Georgia will gather to celebrate Thanksgiving. At most of those tables, someone will say grace over the meal. There are probably as many ways to bless the food on a Southern table as there are Southerners waiting to eat it. We asked Salvation South editor Chuck Reese for his thoughts on table blessings.

Chuck Reece: When Thanksgiving is coming, I often think about my friend Ann Byrne, who was a food writer based in Nashville. Many years ago, Ann and I had a conversation about table blessings, and we talked about the various ways we had heard people say grace around our tables. I asked Ann to write about that, and later that year, as Thanksgiving rolled around, I've published a beautiful story she wrote called our ways of saying grace. For that piece, Ann spent, and I quote from her story here, ""several months talking to religious leaders, folklorists, teachers, friends, and families all over the South. I learned that the blessing of food on the Southern table, saying grace, is alive and well. But like our world, it has changed."" I'm sure it is still changing, particularly when political issues have become so divisive in our country. This time of year, it is easy to find stories in newspapers and magazines about people who ban the discussion of politics around the Thanksgiving table, or people who refuse to celebrate the holiday with this family member or that one because of their political beliefs. So, what can unite us this year? There are bound to be things we can all be thankful for. First, I think there is the table itself, and the people who gather around it.

In her story, Anne quoted the late Nashville journalist John Edgerton. A couple of sentences from his landmark book, Southern Food: ""Family life often revolved around the kitchen and the dining table. Prayers were said at the table, important decisions were made, and the principle of family unity was repeatedly reinforced there."" And second, there is the food that will sit on our tables. Whether your Thanksgiving dinner will be a grand feast for an extended family of a couple dozen folks or a more meager meal, the chance to nourish one's body for one more day of life must always be a source of gratitude. Third, there is that phrase that's so common among Southern table blessings: ""And the hands that prepared it."" Somebody once told me a story about a gathering of friends around a takeout meal: To-go barbecue that was bought from a chain that has locations all over the South. And the person who volunteered to say grace, ended the prayer this way: ""Bless this food and the hands that prepared it: Sonny's."" Even when the cook isn't someone in your own family, blessing the hands that prepared it is never a bad idea. And those three pieces, I think, make a fine recipe for a table blessing in times like these.

,,2025-11-26 20:58:04+00:00,autoevolution,Huge Milestone for One of the Most Advanced Five-Seat Hybrid VTOLs - autoevolution,Otilia Drăgan,,,,,https://www.autoevolution.com/news/huge-milestone-for-one-of-the-most-advanced-five-seat-hybrid-vtols-261679.html,"This new demonstrator will also validate all phases of VTOL flight at full scale, and all testing will be unmanned.
Metal is more affordable and more compatible with fast design modifications, which makes it suitable for demonstrator aircraft.
The upcoming TD 2.0 flight campaign will mark a significant milestone on the path to certifying the final Zuri hybrid-electric VTOL.
With its extended range and spacious five-seat configuration, the Zuri VTOL looks like an attractive alternative to standard regional jets.
Additionally, as SAF-ready from day one, the Zuri VTOL will also be able to reduce emissions almost as much as a fully-electric eVTOL.","The TD 2.0 builds on the success of the first-generation Zuri demonstrator and incorporates several upgrades meant to smooth the path to full certification of the commercial version. The upgraded design features a new tail and an improved propulsion layout for reduced drag and better stability.

This new demonstrator will also validate all phases of VTOL flight at full scale, and all testing will be unmanned. Lastly, it will integrate the hybrid-propulsion system for extended range.

The TD 2.0 will boast a maximum takeoff weight of almost 700 kg (1,540 lbs), compared to the 2,800 kg (6,000 lbs) MTOW of the future commercial Zuri aircraft, along with a significantly shorter range and lower cruise speed.

An important difference focuses on airframe materials; while the demonstrator will be made of metal, the final aircraft is set to switch to advanced composites. Metal is more affordable and more compatible with fast design modifications, which makes it suitable for demonstrator aircraft. On the other hand, composite materials will enable the final VTOL to boast a lighter weight, in line with certification standards, and increased aerodynamic efficiency.

Zuri has already started working on the new demonstrator airframe, with flight tests set to begin in late 2026 or even early 2027. The upcoming TD 2.0 flight campaign will mark a significant milestone on the path to certifying the final Zuri hybrid-electric VTOL.

Zuri primarily targets regional air mobility with fewer CO2 emissions. The Czech VTOL will not only boast hybrid-electric propulsion, but will also be SAF-ready from day one. This means that it will be compatible with the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel instead of conventional fuel, further reducing emissions for cleaner, more sustainable flight.

The Zuri VTOL promises a regional range of up to 700 km (435 miles) without the need to recharge, coupled with a cruise speed of 350 kph (218 mph). With its extended range and spacious five-seat configuration, the Zuri VTOL looks like an attractive alternative to standard regional jets.

Zuri operates an advanced research and development center in Prague and is currently developing an integrated systems ground test platform, named the Iron Bird, specifically dedicated to the validation of hybrid-electric systems.

Like all VTOL concepts, this Czech aircraft combines fixed-wing flight with vertical flight capabilities and is meant to operate independently from conventional airport infrastructure, which is another advantage for future regional operations and greater accessibility. Additionally, as SAF-ready from day one, the Zuri VTOL will also be able to reduce emissions almost as much as a fully-electric eVTOL.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/huge-milestone-for-one-of-the-most-advanced-five-seat-hybrid-vtols-261679_1.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 16:56:38.176951

In 2016, the Federal Court confirmed that the territory is of traditional Indigenous occupation.
Ribeiro’s corn supply contract with FS, in effect from August to December 2023, totaled R$ 12,700 (USD 2,400).","The BNDES (Brazilian Development Bank) has notified FS Indústria de Biocombustíveis, one of Brazil’s leading corn-ethanol producers, after Repórter Brasil informed the bank that a partner and supplier of the company had been fined by Ibama (Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources) for illegal planting on 5,300 hectares inside the Batelão Indigenous Land, located in Tabaporã, Mato Grosso, one of the country’s main grain-producing states.

Between 2023 and 2025, FS received at least R$ 600 million (USD 112,3 million) in BNDES financing to invest in its biofuel production. The largest loan—R$ 500 million (USD 94,3 million)—came from the National Climate Change Fund, known as the Climate Fund.

Miguel Vaz Ribeiro was fined R$ 2.9 million (USD 547,169) by Ibama in April this year for planting genetically modified corn and cotton on Fazenda São Jorge, which overlaps the Indigenous territory. Ribeiro is a partner at FS Indústria de Biocombustíveis and is listed as a supplier of corn to the company, according to supply contracts accessed by Repórter Brasil. The producer is also the mayor of Lucas do Rio Verde city, in Mato Grosso.

Brazilian law prohibits the cultivation of genetically modified organisms on Indigenous lands and in conservation units. Ibama also classified the violation as biopiracy—the illegal exploitation of biological resources and traditional knowledge—and ordered the destruction of the crops.

FS received R$ 500 million from BNDES for corn-ethanol investments

In September 2024, BNDES announced a R$ 500 million loan for FS to build a new corn-ethanol plant in Querência, Mato Grosso, with a capacity of up to 400,000 tons. The funding was provided through the Climate Fund. Linked to the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change (MMA), the fund was created to support projects that reduce the effects of climate change and is described by the ministry as “the main financial instrument for Brazil’s ecological transition.”

During COP30, the MMA and BNDES announced the raising of R$ 8.84 billion (USD 1,6 billion) for the Climate Fund through letters of intent signed with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and three European financial institutions.

In March 2023, FS had already received R$ 100 million (USD 18,8 million), this time through RenovaBio, a program under the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME). The resources were intended to improve the company’s energy-environmental efficiency, according to BNDES.

Asked about Ibama’s fine against one of FS’s partners and suppliers, BNDES stated that it had “formally notified the company and awaits clarification of the facts described in order to define its actions regarding the contracts.” The bank explained that all financing projects undergo social and environmental risk assessments and that FS “went through a thorough registration review” in which “no final judgments related to environmental and/or labor violations were found that would prevent the granting of financing.” The bank added that, if irregularities are identified in ongoing financing contracts, it may suspend disbursements and, “in more serious situations,” demand early repayment. Read here the bank full responses.

The MMA reiterated the response sent by BNDES, sharing the same statement.

The MME, responsible for RenovaBio, was contacted but had not responded by publication time. FS also did not respond to Repórter Brasil’s questions. The space remains open for future comments.

Funai says property title is void

In addition to Miguel Vaz Ribeiro, Fazenda São Jorge is registered under the name of Marino José Franz and Dankang Fiagril Administração de Bens, a company whose board of directors includes Franz. Both Franz and Dankang Fiagril are listed as partners of Fiagril, an agricultural inputs and grains producer based in Mato Grosso.

Franz is also a partner at FS Indústria de Biocombustíveis and has a history of supplying the biofuels producer, according to documents obtained by the investigation.

Ribeiro, Franz, and Dankang Fiagril jointly contest the Ibama fine in court. In May this year, they secured a court ruling suspending the destruction of the crops until a later judicial decision on the penalty.

The Batelão Indigenous Land, traditionally occupied by the Kayabi people, had its declaratory ordinance published in 2007. Since then, farmers—including Ribeiro and Franz—have claimed ownership of areas in ongoing court cases. In 2008, the Ministry of Justice suspended the previous year’s ordinance following a determination by the Superior Court of Justice. In 2016, the Federal Court confirmed that the territory is of traditional Indigenous occupation. It is currently listed by Funai (National Indigenous People Foundation) as “declared,” with physical demarcation and homologation still pending.

In September 2025, a ruling by the Federal Regional Court of the 1st Region (TRF1) ordered Funai to remove restrictive information regarding the use of farms within the territory until the Indigenous land was fully homologated.

When questioned, Ribeiro and Franz responded through their attorney that Ibama had stated there was an overlap between Fazenda São Jorge and a “still non-existent Indigenous land.” They referenced the TRF1 ruling and argued that restrictions on properties overlapping Indigenous territories “can only take effect after eventual homologation of the Batelão Indigenous Land.”

According to the farmers, “the party acting illegally is Funai, which shares false information with public agencies about Indigenous land overlapping private properties whose demarcation procedures have not been concluded.” They also claimed “there is no irregular planting by Miguel, Marino or Dankang Fiagril,” since “there is no demarcated Indigenous land overlapping the property.”

Miguel Ribeiro and Marino Franz—who has also served as mayor and deputy mayor of Lucas do Rio Verde—said FS is aware of the fine and that the company “continues to follow current environmental standards and procedures,” since the Indigenous land is not yet homologated and the planting “is regular and authorized” by the state environmental agency. Their full statement can be read here.

In a statement to the investigation, Funai reiterated that the Batelão Indigenous Land is properly delimited, that the courts have recognized the traditional occupation, and that the titles of properties overlapping the area—“such as the rural properties known as ‘Fazenda São Jorge’”—are null. The agency also said that since October it has been working to overturn the injunction ordering the removal of information on Fazenda São Jorge from its records, “given the unequivocal cartographic evidence of the overlap.” Read Funai’s full statement here.

Dankang Fiagril Administração de Bens and Fiagril did not comment by publication time. The space remains open for future responses.

Contracts with FS

Miguel Vaz Ribeiro and Marino José Franz supplied corn to FS under contracts in force between 2022 and 2024, according to capital-market documents accessed by Repórter Brasil.

Ribeiro’s corn supply contract with FS, in effect from August to December 2023, totaled R$ 12,700 (USD 2,400).

Franz’s corn contract with FS totaled R$ 1.3 million (USD 245,283), from June 2022 to April 2024. He also signed a R$ 2.2 million (USD 413,000) contract with FS for the supply—between September 2023 and July 2024—of DDG (Dried Distillers Grains), a corn by-product used for animal feed and one of the company’s main outputs.

After publication of the investigation, Franz and Ribeiro’s defense stated that the pair sells approximately 2% of the corn purchased by FS and that the contracts “comply with FS’s sustainability and compliance policies.” They also said Fazenda São Jorge has no active contracts and is not an FS supplier.

Sustainability discourse

At COP30, Brazil played a leading role in biofuels discussions. Government representatives, companies, and NGOs promoted the “Belém 4X” commitment, aimed at quadrupling the use of sustainable fuels by 2035.

The report “The Biofuels Bill”, released by Repórter Brasil in October 2025, revealed that the production chains of ethanol, biodiesel, and SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) are linked to deforestation, land conflicts, and slave labor.

With production units in Mato Grosso, FS presents itself as “Brazil’s first ethanol producer 100% from corn” and claims to be contributing “to the global effort against climate change” through sustainable production. At least four FS representatives were accredited to participate in COP30—three of them invited by the Brazilian government.

The company publicly promotes socio-environmental policies, including requirements for supplier compliance, such as “not carrying out agricultural or commercial activities in territories overlapping Indigenous Lands.”

Biopiracy on Indigenous land

Law 11.460/2007, cited by Ibama in the violation, prohibits “the research and cultivation of genetically modified organisms on Indigenous lands and in conservation units.”

In Ribeiro’s infraction notice, Ibama states that “the use of genetically modified crops puts local varieties—such as traditional landraces, developed over centuries by traditional farmers and Indigenous peoples—at risk.” It adds: “In addition, there is the possibility of harmful effects on the health of traditional communities and Indigenous peoples due to the increasingly potent pesticides and herbicides used.”

“When you bring these foods into the villages, you also bring agrochemicals,” says Alberto Terena, one of the executive coordinators of Apib (Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil). “It is a change in these people’s way of life, and it impacts their health.”

Legal battle

Most of the original inhabitants of the Batelão Indigenous Land were expelled and relocated to the Xingu Indigenous Park in the 1960s, two decades after colonization of the region began, according to data compiled by the NGO Instituto Socioambiental.

As the demarcation process drags on in court, the area faces conflicts and is a site of logging, deforestation, and agribusiness activity, according to a study published by the organizations Opan (Operação Amazônia Nativa) and ICV (Instituto Centro de Vida).

The study mapped rural-property claims over approximately 88,000 hectares overlapping the Batelão Indigenous Land—just over 75% of its total area.

“The legal tools used by invaders to delay judicial decisions are a strategy that, unfortunately, succeeds. While the legal matter remains unresolved, invaders are degrading the Kayabi people’s heritage,” analyzes Ricardo da Costa Carvalho, an indigenist with Opan.",https://reporterbrasil.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/card_bndes_eng.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 17:57:11.754127

This marks an important step towards establishing methanol bunkering at large scale and driving Singapore’s ambition to become a sustainable multi-fuel bunkering hub.

Licences will be awarded to Global Energy Trading Pte Ltd, Golden Island Pte Ltd, and PetroChina International (Singapore) Pte Ltd. The three companies were selected from a total of 13 applicants through a comprehensive evaluation process that assessed supply chain reliability, operational readiness, safety systems, and the sustainability certification of the methanol volume to be supplied. The strong interest reflects the sector’s growing focus on lower-emission marine fuels.

The licences will be valid for a five-year period, from January 1, 2026 to December 31, 2030, subject to successful applicants meeting relevant licensing conditions. The five-year period supports the early development of methanol bunkering by giving licensees sufficient scope to build capabilities, strengthen supply chains, and anchor initial investments as the market develops.

The MPA will continue to review the licensing framework, incorporating operational experience, technological developments, and evolving international standards so that the framework remains demand-responsive, practical, robust, and aligned with global standards and development.

Chevron plans to market the hydrogen fuel produced by Raven’s Richmond plant in Northern California.
The facility initially sought a solid waste facility permit, but was discouraged from taking in food waste by officials who said that the material should be diverted to compost.
The Trump administration has also pulled back federal support for hydrogen fuel, forcing California’s hydrogen hub to pause operations after losing $1.2 billion in funding.
Once it’s operational, the Richmond facility can produce a hydrogen fuel that is priced competitively to traditional hydrocarbons, Murdock said.","Dive Brief:

Raven SR, which has piloted technology capable of producing hydrogen fuel from organic waste, received an air permit and authority to construct its first planned facility in Richmond, California, the company announced last week.

Raven partnered with Republic Services to site its $75 million facility on the closed West Contra Costa Sanitary Landfill. Raven’s facility will process up to 99 wet tons of biomass — including yard waste, agricultural residues and untreated construction wood, but not food waste — per day.

The facility is expected to produce up to 2,400 metric tons of hydrogen annually once operational. It still needs a final permit from Richmond, which CEO and cofounder Matt Murdock said should be straightforward to attain. He expects construction will begin on the facility early next year.

Dive Insight:

Raven, founded in 2018 and based in Wyoming, aims to commercialize the process of converting organic waste to synthetic gas and then to hydrogen fuel. Raven says its process is more efficient than competing forms of hydrogen fuel production and does not use fresh water — a priority in California.

Early investors included Samsung Ventures and Chevron New Energies, the latter of which holds a 50% equity stake in Raven SR, with other partners coming on in subsequent funding rounds. Chevron plans to market the hydrogen fuel produced by Raven’s Richmond plant in Northern California. Hyzon Motors, which produced the first operable hydrogen fuel cell refuse vehicle in the U.S., was also an early investor in Raven but has since gone out of business.

Murdock said he’s learned a lot by watching other hydrogen fuel ventures launch and fail in recent years. He said he’s learned two key lessons: don’t be dependent on government subsidies and don’t load your venture with debt. Raven is funded through equity agreements, he noted. And while the company expects to benefit from certain tax credits, Murdock said they’re not necessary to make the Richmond facility pencil out.

The facility itself will take about an acre and a half of space, with half of that space used for trucks delivering waste and picking up the final hydrogen fuel. Raven will process about 100 tons per day of material and produce about 60% to 70% of its own energy, the rest of which Murdock hopes to obtain from other renewable sources. The facility will produce about 2,400 metric tons of hydrogen annually.

Raven and Republic first announced their partnership in 2021. Raven leases its site from the waste company, and is set to receive all of its feedstock from Republic’s existing transfer station on the closed landfill site. A spokesperson for Republic Services declined to comment further on the partnership.

The more than three years it’s taken to get the project permitted is longer than Raven and its partners hoped, Murdock said. The facility initially sought a solid waste facility permit, but was discouraged from taking in food waste by officials who said that the material should be diverted to compost. Raven switched to obtain a biomass conversion facility permit instead.

Along the way, Raven has continued to refine its facility plans to maximize its efficiency. Murdock said there was a lot of excitement for hydrogen fueling when Raven first announced its California facility. But that excitement has cooled somewhat as renewable sources of the fuel remain few. The Trump administration has also pulled back federal support for hydrogen fuel, forcing California’s hydrogen hub to pause operations after losing $1.2 billion in funding.

With the launch of Raven’s facility, which the company expects will occur in 2027, Murdock hopes the pendulum will swing back toward hydrogen vehicles.

Once it’s operational, the Richmond facility can produce a hydrogen fuel that is priced competitively to traditional hydrocarbons, Murdock said. The company already has another facility in development in Spain, and is planning additional locations in the United States. He said the technology is straightforward to replicate at future sites, and can be modified to support the production of sustainable aviation fuel, methanol or other next-generation fuels that are seeing rising demand.

“If we can produce a low-cost hydrogen and get it into the market... that’s going to be a big deal,” Murdock said. “My hope is that we can start pushing the dominoes the other way, and people start coming back into the market.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/plgaO3UZQLlGr9bywpnj-gRI8W9jSIohMXDwwDCAuDA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9SYXZlbl9TUl9TLVNlcmllc19IaVJlc19Ob19LZXlfMV9sb2dvbGVzcy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-26 12:57:23.255303

GHG Protocol’s Actions and Market Instruments workstream is developing a multi-statement reporting structure to complement corporate GHG inventories. The initiative responds to the fact that many company actions, including investments in emission reduction or removal projects and the use of market instruments, may fall outside inventory boundaries and are not reflected in scope 1, scope 2, or scope 3 data. The new structure is designed to enable transparent and complete reporting of these impacts while keeping them separate from physical inventories. It aims to support decarbonisation investments across all sectors and address reporting for instruments such as virtual power purchase agreements, biomethane certificates, and sustainable aviation fuel. A multistakeholder Technical Working Group is developing the approach. A Phase 1 White Paper is underway, with public consultation planned for early 2026 and Phase 2 beginning later that year.

Experts link dollar dependence to green investment challenges

G20 think tanks urged countries to reduce the dominance of the U.S. dollar in the global economy. The discussions took place in Johannesburg ahead of the G20 summit, where major economies and the European Union meet to address global financial issues. The T20, a network of research institutes that provides policy advice to G20 leaders, endorsed a communique calling for a more diversified international financial architecture. The group said reliance on a single currency exposed countries in the Global South to external shocks and debt crises. It recommended promoting the use of local currencies in trade and finance, developing multi-currency cross-border payment systems, and expanding swap lines and multilateral development bank loans in local currencies. Bruno De Conti of Positive Money led the initiative and said dollar dependence limited investment capacity, including in renewable energy. The T20 also warned that delaying the launch of central bank digital currencies could increase dollarisation, noting that most Global South debt is denominated in dollars.

AI and revenues reshape 2025 sustainability strategy

Deloitte Global’s 2025 survey of more than 2,100 executives shows strong sustainability engagement, with AI playing an expanding role. Eighty-one per cent of respondents said they already use AI for monitoring, reporting, scenario analysis, product innovation, and operational efficiency. Revenue generation emerged as the most frequently cited business benefit of sustainability actions, ahead of compliance outcomes, brand and reputation, and risk and resiliency. Some activities declined compared to 2024: tying senior leader compensation to sustainability performance, requiring suppliers to meet sustainability standards, and reducing emissions through renewable energy purchases. Overall investment remains high, with 83% of executives increasing spending in the past year. The survey also shows reduced stakeholder pressure since 2022. It indicates that climate change is viewed as less disruptive in the near term. Organisations are reassessing their ambitions, resources, and risks as sustainability strategies continue to evolve.

UK NGO urges mandatory measures to stop nurdle spills

Fidra, a Scottish environmental charity, is calling on governments worldwide to introduce legislation that enforces strict good-practice requirements across the plastic supply chain, and urging the International Maritime Organisation to adopt robust mandatory rules to prevent nurdle losses at sea. The appeal follows findings that nurdles, tiny plastic pellets used in plastic production, were found at 168 of 195 UK sites of special scientific interest, meaning 84% of protected locations are contaminated. The pellets were also found in six national parks, including Loch Lomond & the Trossachs and the North York Moors. Nurdles are frequently spilt during production and transport, with an estimated 53 billion lost annually in the UK. Fidra highlighted risks linked to toxic chemicals and the creation of microplastics, which harm wildlife and enter the human food chain, stressing that these impacts stem from preventable industrial pollution.

The expectation is that HAL will submit a formal application for development consent after completion of the ANPS review process.
Alexander said: “Heathrow is our only hub airport which supports trade, tourism and hundreds of thousands of jobs, underpinning prosperity not only in the South East but across the UK.
Heathrow, currently serving as the UK’s main hub airport, processed 23.4 million passengers during the peak summer season.
These measures are intended to accommodate future traffic projections and synchronise with anticipated throughput from an expanded Heathrow by 2035.","Heathrow Airport Limited’s (HAL) proposal for a third runway will serve as the foundation for the next stage of Heathrow expansion, following confirmation from UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander.

This decision sets Heathrow’s scheme as the basis for the review of the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS), which guides planning and regulatory decisions for airport development in the UK.

Any proposed modifications to the ANPS will open for public and industry consultation in summer 2026, with subsequent parliamentary scrutiny.

The government selected HAL’s proposal after evaluating submissions from the remaining candidates last month, assessing deliverability and alignment with parliamentary timelines for a development consent decision.

The expectation is that HAL will submit a formal application for development consent after completion of the ANPS review process.

Review procedures are designed to incorporate updated environmental and climate change considerations into airport planning frameworks.

Alexander stated that she contacted the independent Climate Change Committee to request advice, specifically regarding the role of aviation in meeting the UK’s carbon budgets.

She also invited feedback on proposed updates to the ANPS to ensure it aligns with climate commitments.

The committee’s input will inform whether capacity increases are consistent with net zero obligations.

Alexander said: “Heathrow is our only hub airport which supports trade, tourism and hundreds of thousands of jobs, underpinning prosperity not only in the South East but across the UK.

“Today is another important step to enable a third runway and build on these benefits, setting the direction for the remainder of our work to get the policy framework in place for airport expansion.”

The Department for Transport has indicated that selection of HAL’s scheme does not amount to final approval for construction or detailed design. Elements such as runway length or configuration will remain subject to technical evaluation through the review period.

The government reiterated that expansion proposals must comply with national legal requirements relating to carbon emissions, air quality, and noise in addition to economic criteria.

Heathrow, currently serving as the UK’s main hub airport, processed 23.4 million passengers during the peak summer season.

Expansion is expected to address capacity demands and is positioned by authorities as a strategic move for supporting connectivity and international commerce.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said: “We’re taking action where previous governments hesitated, and moving forward with Heathrow’s third runway to drive economic growth, international investment and better connections for our country.”

Simultaneously, work is underway on national airspace modernisation efforts aimed at optimising aircraft routing efficiency and reducing operational emissions.

Updated Airspace Design Strategic Objectives specify that Greater London’s airspace, which is currently handling over 1.1 million movements annually, will take precedence in redesign processes.

These measures are intended to accommodate future traffic projections and synchronise with anticipated throughput from an expanded Heathrow by 2035.

A government consultation has also commenced on revisions to Air Navigation Guidance, focusing on clarifying regulatory priorities related to airspace changes while maintaining mechanisms for public engagement.

This update follows recent approvals for expansion projects at Luton and Gatwick airports.

The guidelines introduce the use of Climate Transition Bonds (CTB), which can be used to finance climate transition projects through utilising the proceeds of the bonds. These projects work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the goals set out in the Paris Agreement.

The guidelines are intended to be used in conjunction with the handbook and set out four core components with which CTBs must align. These cover the use of proceeds, the process for the evaluation and selection of projects, the management of proceeds, and how project information should be reported.

Government consultation on the draft Climate Change Agreements (Energy-intensive Installations and Eligible Facilities) (Amendment) Regulations 2026

HM Revenue and Customs has published a consultation on the draft Climate Change Agreements (Energy-intensive Installations and Eligible Facilities) (Amendment) Regulations 2026. The regulations aim to bring three energy-intensive processes within scope of the climate change agreement (CCA). These are:

the mechanical recycling of plastic;

the packaging of spirits; and

the production of batteries for electric vehicles.

CCAs are voluntary agreements which commit sector associations and their members, who operate energy-intensive installations and facilities, to increase their energy efficiency or reduce their carbon emissions. In return, they will receive a reduced rate of the climate change levy (CCL).

From 1 January 2026 to 31 December 2030, sectors and operators will be required to enter into new CCAs with amended terms and new targets. Participants in the scheme will be eligible for reduced rates of CCL up to 31 March 2033.

The consultation will close on 2 December 2025, with the government intending to bring the changes into force by January 2027.

Government publishes consultation on proposals to accelerate the phasedown of HFCs

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has published a consultation on proposals to accelerate the phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in Great Britain. HFCs are an example of man-made fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases), which were introduced to replace chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). While F-gases (unlike CFCs) do not damage the ozone layer, they are powerful greenhouse gases with a global warming effect that is substantially larger than that of carbon dioxide.

The current proposals would accelerate the HFCs phasedown schedule to go further than the current target of cutting the amount coming onto the market by 79% by 2030. The aim is to achieve a phase-out of HFCs of 98.6% by 2048.

Environment Agency publishes new guidance on decarbonisation readiness under the Environmental Permitting Regime

The Environment Agency (EA) has published new guidance on decarbonisation readiness (DR) under the Environmental Permitting (EP) regime.

From 28 February 2026, operators of new and substantially refurbished combustion plants will be required to introduce a DR report as part of the EP application in England under the Environmental Permitting (Electricity Generating Stations) (Amendment) Regulations 2025 (SI 2025/154). Such plants are required to be built in a way that enables them to be decarbonised within their lifetime. This can either be by converting to hydrogen-firing or retrofit carbon capture technology. The regulations replace the requirements under the Carbon Capture Readiness (Electricity Generating Stations) Regulations 2013 (SI 2013/2969) in England.

The new guidance outlines how DR reports should be prepared under an EP application. The guidance:

clarifies the scope, exemptions and definitions;

reinforces its approach to proportionality and flexibility;

adds clarification boxes on transitioning to DR; and

gives further explanation on charging and how to update DR reports.

The EA has also published a consultation on proposals to change standard rules permits under the EP regime to reflect the new DR requirements. This consultation closes on 18 December 2025.

Government responds to consultation on changes to the network charging compensation scheme

The Department for Business and Trade has published the government response to its consultation on increasing the network charging compensation (NCC) scheme in support of energy-intensive industries. The NCC scheme forms part of a package of measures called the British Industry Supercharger, which aims to reduce carbon leakage by energy-intensive industries (EIIs). The NCC scheme offers relief to EIIs that hold a valid certificate under the EII exemption scheme by compensating them for a portion of their network charging costs.

The response to the consultation outlines that the government will:

increase the relief offered by the scheme from 60% to 90% from 1 April 2026; and

extend the application window for the scheme from one month to two months from 30 June 2026.

The response also suggests that the EII support levy will be increased from 1 April 2027 to cover the costs of the changes to the NCC scheme. Electricity suppliers will be given a six-month forecast of the increase in costs in October 2026. EIIs who submit a Q2 2026 claim will receive the uplifted compensation after April 2027.

Government publishes response to Climate Change Committee 2025 adaptation progress report

The Climate Change Committee (CCC) published its progress report in April 2025, assessing the extent to which the government's Third National Adaptation Programme (NAP3) and its implementation are preparing the UK for the impacts of climate change. Defra has now published the government's response to the report.

The government provided responses to the priority recommendations in the report relating to the key sectors of (i) land, (ii) nature and food, (iii) infrastructure, (iv) the built environment and communities, (v) health and well-being, and (vi) the economy. It also highlighted the steps taken by the government to build resilience to climate change risk since 2024.

The government responded to the CCC's recommended key areas of improvement to the NAP3 as follows:

It stated that it would publish a National Adaptation Programme Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Framework, to inform and improve data collection and reporting. This will guide objective development and plans for implementation ahead of NAP4.

It noted the work done on co-ordinating and integrating climate risk adaptation with wider resilience work, such as the Resilience Action Plan and the Chronic Risk Analysis.

It cited the updated supplementary Green Book guidance which considers the effects of climate change as an example of adaptation being integrated.

Government publishes updated Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan

The government has updated its Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan as part of a package of documents relating to the UK's net zero transition and energy security. The High Court had previously found the Carbon Budget Delivery Plan to be inadequate in May 2024, ordering the government to publish a revised plan. The updated plan has been published in response to this decision.

The government has stated that it ""builds on our action to accelerate clean, homegrown energy for the British people"". The emissions reduction targets set by the previous government have not changed under the updated plan.

The government has published a summary of the actions it is taking on clean energy and climate action to accompany the plan. This covers energy security and lower electricity bills, jobs and economic growth, quality of life and health and protecting the natural environment.

Supreme Court decision on nutrient neutrality and Habitats Regulations assessment requirements

On 22 October 2025, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in C G Fry & Son Ltd v Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government [2025] UKSC 35. This decision reaffirms the protections afforded to sites protected under the Habitats Regulations 2017.

The Supreme Court confirmed that the requirement to conduct an appropriate assessment could apply after the initial application for planning permission where sites are protected under the Habitat Regulations 2017. In doing so, the court highlighted ""the protective purpose of the Habitats Regulations"" and emphasised the importance of this.

The case has wider implications from a planning perspective, with the court setting out that a Local Planning Authority (LPA) is bound by specified planning conditions once an outline planning permission has been granted subject to those conditions. In making this decision, it confirmed that Ramsar sites are not protected by the Habitats Regulations as a matter of law. This may change if the current Planning and Infrastructure Bill before Parliament is implemented, which has just undergone its third reading in the House of Lords.

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero publishes independent review of greenhouse gas removals

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has published its independent review of greenhouse gas removals (GGRs). The increased use of GGRs is believed to help the UK meet its carbon budget and net zero targets under the Climate Change Act 2008.

The review offers five recommendations for the government to implement to facilitate GGR mechanisms in the UK, with options for GGR mechanisms including large-scale bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air carbon capture and storage. These recommendations include:

Developing a GGR strategy, identifying how GGR solutions can be used to help the UK meet its carbon budget and net zero targets. This strategy should outline the role for BECCS within this strategy, alongside a plan for maximising GGRs based on underutilised resources in the UK.

Minimising the UK's use of imported biomass feedstock, identifying ways in which UK sustainable feedstocks can be used as a basis for GGRs.

Renaming the sustainable aviation fuel mandate to the net zero aviation mandate. This mandate should be amended to ensure that all flights departing from the UK are climate neutral by 2045.

The review recommends that the UK should establish itself as an international leader on GGRs.

Welsh government plans to reform management of the water sector and Natural Resources Wales publishes consultation on water management in Wales

The deputy first minister for Wales, Huw Irranca-Davies, has announced the Welsh government's plans to reform the management of the water sector in response to the Independent Water Commission's final report.

The plans include the introduction of a new regulator for water in Wales. It also seeks powers that would allow Wales to legislate independently for the water industry. The Welsh government's aim is to progress regulation of the water sector ""towards an ethical, collaborative framework built on sustainability, affordability and fairness"". This will include introducing stronger environmental regulation, support for independent customer advocacy and exploration of an ombudsman for water in Wales, alongside economic regulations. There will be a consultation on the reforms later this year.

Also relevant to the Welsh water sector, Natural Resources Wales published a consultation on managing water quality in Wales using river basin management plans. This includes considering problems of flooding, pollution, invasive non-native species, nutrients, and the climate and nature emergencies. The consultation will close on 21 April 2026.

Government publishes consultation on strengthening civil sanctions for specified environmental offences by water companies

Defra has published a consultation on new penalties for water companies that commit environmental offences in England. The consultation seeks views on proposals which would allow the Environment Agency to impose variable monetary penalties (VMPs) on the basis of the civil standard of proof (""on the balance of probabilities"") rather than the criminal standard (""beyond reasonable doubt"") for certain moderate offences, essentially lowering the threshold for such penalty enforcement.

The revised standard would apply to offences under the regimes for environmental permitting, water abstraction, water impounding and drought. The proposals suggest that the maximum value of VMPs that could be imposed under the lower civil standard of proof would be £350,000 or £500,000.

Defra is also seeking views on requiring the EA to impose automatic fixed monetary penalties to the civil standard of proof for specific minor environmental offences. These would apply to specific environmental permitting or abstraction breaches, including a failure to report a significant pollution incident without four hours, breach of certain data requirements and using an emergency overflow more than three times a year. The consultation is seeking views on what the maximum level of the new automatic penalty should be.

The proposals under this consultation will require parliamentary approval of secondary legislation. The consultation will close on 3 December 2025.

Increased flexibilities for manufacturers in vehicle emissions trading schemes

The Vehicle Emissions Trading Schemes (Amendment) (No 2) Order 2025 (SI 2025/1101) (VETS No 2 Order 2025) comes into force on 1 January 2026, amending the Vehicle Emissions Trading Schemes Order 2023 (SI 2023/1394) (VETS Order 2023). The VETS Order 2023 set up four separate vehicle emission trading schemes, providing a route for phasing out new purely internal combustion engine vehicles, as all new cars and vans are to be fully zero emission by 2035.

The VETS No 2 Order implements the following amendments:

Providing manufacturers with additional routes to compliance, and allowing them greater flexibility to bank and borrow allowances and to convert over-compliance within one trading scheme to support them in complying with another.

Reducing the compliance payments payable where manufacturers fail to meet targets.

Implementing technical changes to assist manufacturers with treatment of plug-in hybrid vehicles.

The amendments are supported by guidance published by the Department for Transport, as well as an explanatory memorandum and policy note.

Government publishes a response to its consultation on Marine Recovery Fund for offshore wind developments

Defra has published the government response to its consultation on how the Marine Recovery Fund (MRF) will function in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The MRF aims to speed up the consenting process for offshore wind developments on Marine Protected Areas by introducing industry-funded measures to compensate for the adverse effects of such developments.

The response suggests that Defra:

will streamline the application process and issue guidance on how MRF delivers compensatory measures using a library of strategic compensatory measures; and

is working with the Scottish Government to ensure that Defra's MRF is aligned with the Scottish MRF.

U.S. farmland has rarely been as closely watched as it is today. After several years of rapid appreciation and inflation-linked gains, values appear to be entering a different phase, one marked by cooler growth, greater regional divergence and a closer tether to underlying income performance. MetLife Investment Management’s 2025 farmland outlook, entitled “The Road Ahead: U.S. Farmland Value Forecasts,” captures this shift in detail, noting that while average land appreciation remains positive, headwinds like high input costs, softer commodity prices and tighter margins are expected to challenge row-crop profitability in the near term.

Against this backdrop, MetLife Investment Management forecasts moderation rather than contraction at the national level, with some regions poised for further gains, particularly the Delta states (Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana) and Lake region, while others face mild declines as fundamentals recalibrate. The report also highlights a record-low cropland rent-to-value ratio of 2.8 percent, highlighting the extent to which appreciation, rather than income, has driven total returns over the past decade.

To unpack these findings, David J. Williams, PhD, Head of Agricultural Research & Strategy at MetLife Investment Management and co-author of the report, spent some time with GAI News. In the following Q&A, Williams shares his perspective on where U.S. farmland values may be headed through 2030, which regions he is watching most closely and how investors should think about risk and opportunity in this cooling but steadfastly resilient market.

1.) GAI News: MetLife Investment Management’s U.S. farmland value forecast points to both long-term tailwinds for U.S. agriculture (rising population, expanding middle class, strong demand for proteins, renewable fuel demand, etc.) as well as near-term headwinds from forces such as softer crop values, painfully elevated input costs, higher interest rates and trade war uncertainty. As you look out to the next three-to-five years, which of these forces do you see as most decisive for farmland values, and what should investors in U.S. farmland be paying closest attention to right now?

David J. Williams: “Among the many moving pieces shaping U.S. farmland values, input expenses stand out as perhaps the most important factor over the next several years. While there’s understandable concern around softer and fluctuating commodity prices, it’s important to recognize that the actual impacts on farm incomes can be quite disparate across the entire Ag landscape. When the prices of major row crops dip, there’s often a plus side for livestock and protein production, since much of that grain goes into animal feed. Similarly, some specialty crops aren’t experiencing the same pressures as row crops, so a blanket statement about prices misses some important nuance. In contrast, input costs like fertilizer, fuel, seed, and machinery have risen across the entire agricultural sector and show little sign of rapidly retreating to pre-pandemic levels. This pressure is felt by virtually every producer, regardless of what crop they’re growing. Easing in these costs would deliver broad-based relief and improve profitability without the side effects of shifting margins from one segment to another.”

2.) GAI News: Your analysis highlights U.S. farmland as a resilient investment that has outpaced inflation, with appreciation contributing over half of cropland returns in the past decade. However, rents have lagged, leading to a historic low for the national average rent-to-value ratio of 2.8 percent and influencing total returns more toward land appreciation than income. This trend seems to persist in the face of tight farmland margins (owning to lower commodity prices and elevated input costs.) Is this trend worrying, and do you expect this divergence between farmland appreciation and rents to persist? If so, could you weigh in on how it might influence investor strategies, such as focusing on regions with stronger cash flows or incorporating additional revenue sources like carbon credits or renewable energy leases?

David J. Williams: “I would say I’m a bit more concerned but not necessarily seeing this trend as a worry today. At a certain point, something has to give, and farmland investment returns need to be drawn from the tangible benefits that the land provides and not just the willingness of someone else to pay more for it later. If we continue to see above average increases in farmland values without a corresponding increase in profitability and rents, then we need to start asking tough questions about how far out of line valuations could become from profitability and what it would take to realign the two.

“As our report indicates, we expect a period of moderation in appreciation and localized declines in specific regions, and I think that cooling in farmland values could be good for the sector in that it would allow for profitability to catch up with valuations. That said, if the trend of compressing cap rates did continue, it would be because investors were willing to pay an increasingly large premium for the diversification benefits and low correlations that farmland provides.

“As for the trend’s implications on potential investment strategy, it will encourage more landowners to consider those lucrative renewable energy lease agreements. We continue to see long-term lease offers in the market that are multiples over the cash rental rates that farm operators will pay. Seeing more acres pulled out of production would also benefit those that weren’t offered a lease as it would result in less production and less competition in the crops that land could produce.”

3.) GAI News: The report points out that row crop returns are leaning more on land value growth than on steady income these days, especially with farmers facing squeezed profits from lower commodity prices and high input costs. Meanwhile, permanent crops in places like the Central Valley are dealing with challenges from water regulations and shifting profits. For institutional investors thinking about where to put their money next, what are the main risk differences and opportunities between row and permanent crops that they should focus on, and do you think we’ll see those gaps narrow or widen as demand for specialty crops like almonds, pistachios, grapes keeps rising?

David J. Williams: “Institutional investors deciding whether to invest in permanent crops or row crops should carefully think about their risk tolerances and return objectives. If you just want a safe low correlation asset and you’re relatively risk averse, then annual cropland is the way to go. If you’re looking for the possibility of above average returns, then permanent crops need to be discussed, but those expected returns come at a cost.

“The risk profile for permanent crops and row crops are very different. The costs to establish an orchard, or purchase one that’s already been established, can amount to multiples over the raw land value. And once established, the value of those biological assets will fluctuate with the profitability of the commodity and may be entirely wiped out if water becomes uneconomical. But that added risk comes with the opportunity for lucrative returns when market fundamentals are in balance.

“My primary concern with permanent crops is the possibility of a supply overhang caused by too many investors planting at one time in the pursuit of high commodity prices. If demand growth doesn’t match that increase in supply, a few years down the line you could have low prices and eventually very costly exits. In the commercial real estate sector this sometimes happens due to apartments taking several years to construct and lease-up, during which time many other developers may be breaking ground. For a permanent crop segment like apples, it can take five years or longer from planting to get full harvests.

“But when the supply side becomes more-or-less fixed, such as what’s happening in the Central Value due to the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), that downside becomes less of a concern. I believe those landowners that had parcels least affected by SGMA and that survive the transition will have the most effective barrier to entry they could ask for that will serve them well in the long run.”

4.) GAI News: Your analysis shows clear regional splits in U.S. farmland appreciation through 2030, with spots like the Delta States and Lake States seemingly well positioned for gains, while areas such as the Northern Plains and Mountain regions could face pullbacks. What do you see as the biggest factors driving these regional variances, and how should investors think about allocating capital when the market is becoming more of a patchwork than a nationwide trend?

David J. Williams: “There were numerous factors that went into determining our outlook, but one of the most significant in explaining the regional variation was trade exposure and relative reliance on foreign export markets. With the recent U.S. – China trade framework we have a lot more clarity on what the trade situation is going to look like over the next several years. The Chinese purchase commitments of 25 million metric tons of soybeans is actually a bit below the historical average. While it’s clear that the 25 MMT is a floor and theoretically we could see an increase, without concrete details on how or why that would happen I wouldn’t assume that we would see an increase in exports at this point in time. The region performing the weakest in our forecast, the Northern Plains, is forecast to decline in part due to the region’s high reliance on shipping by rail to Pacific Northwest ports for final export to China. For the investor, it’s important to understand that while the commodities being grown across the country might look identical, the cash prices and basis can vary significantly due to differences in local supply and demand, and to understand what risks you want to be more or less exposed to.”

5.) GAI News: What stands out to you as the most surprising part of this year’s farmland value outlook and what is bigger investor takeaway?

David J. Williams: “Our expectation of moderation in farmland appreciation is in large part due to the ongoing state of high supplies of major row crops. But there is huge demand potential for grains and oilseeds in the long run through sustainable aviation fuel and higher ethanol blend rates. Brazil is a leader in biofuel usage, with a 30 percent ethanol blend rate – triple the U.S. average. A 30 percent ethanol blend rate in the U.S. would require an additional 11 billion bushels of corn each year. Replacing all domestic aviation fuel usage with ethanol-to-jet based sustainable aviation fuel would require approximately 12.5 billion bushels of corn each year. These are huge numbers that could bolster the sector while reducing its vulnerability to foreign export markets.

“While these demand sources require policy change, and political support for them vary administration to administration, I see them as inevitable. Fossil fuels are a finite resource, and we will run out of them, or exhaust them to the point of economic infeasibility, eventually, and there will always be a need for fuels with the energy density that batteries cannot achieve. Crop yields will continue to increase with technological advancements, and the U.S. will lead the way in expanding global production levels. Over the last 50 years the U.S. average corn yield has more than doubled, from 86.4 to 186 bushels per acre, and they’ll continue to increase. These fuels will be key to providing a use for all those crops – eventually.”

Airbus is helping the aerospace industry to reach its long-term goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.

Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus, says: “This means expanding production of these new, fuel-efficient aircraft to help airlines accelerate the renewal of their fleets.

“With partners from across the world, Airbus is advocating for and investing in sustainable aviation fuels, which are critical to making progress in reducing emissions today.

“Our core principles of safety, quality, integrity, compliance and security will guide us in all we do.”

The energy transition in aviation

Airbus has developed a decarbonisation roadmap to help support the energy transition.

The company is aiming to increase the uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) across the industry.

Its aircraft are already capable of flying on a blend of up to 50% SAF and conventional fuel and it plans to make all of its aircraft and helicopters able to fly with up to 100% SAF by 2030.

Using SAF provides a potential reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of up to 80% throughout its lifecycle when compared to kerosene, according to the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

Airbus is working closely with fuel producers, airlines, governments and researchers to accelerate SAF production and increase its availability.

Promoting a lifecycle approach

Airbus designs its products with circularity in mind, building them to last for more than 20 years.

The company aims to reduce environmental impacts across its operations and supply chains.

It has been working on building resilience into its supply chain, starting with sourcing its materials up until its products’ end of life.

Airbus aims to minimise waste and raw material use to extend the lifespan of its services and products and encourages its customers and partners to do the same.

Its target is to reduce its waste collection by 20% and have 0% landfilling and incineration without energy recovery by 2030, compared to 2015 levels.

Julie Kitcher, Chief Sustainability Officer at Airbus, says: “We want to do business in a way that benefits society as a whole.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b8ca38c972e9f9d52119202571a93dac:d0b3b4ad50bd7063173a0b6157e2346a/airbus-beluga-plane.JPG.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 10:58:13.660987

With the help of advanced computer programs, bioenergy researchers can now make better predictions by looking at lots of complex data and finding patterns.
Focus on corn stover The INL team processed corn stover, which is the stalks, leaves, husks and cobs left over after corn is harvested.
From there, Xia’s team conducted biomass size reduction experiments with the PDU’s knife mill.
“Our industry partners have the expertise, but they might not be able to afford the sophisticated hardware and software tools needed to conduct this kind of research,” Xia said.","Turning materials like wood chips, crop residues and municipal solid waste into fuels and chemicals is important for our country’s energy independence.

Over the past two decades, the U.S. Department of Energy Bioenergy Technologies Office laid out ambitious goals for processing these biomass resources into useful, affordable industrial fuels and feedstocks.

However, figuring out how to make small pieces of biomass flow easily through machinery during processing remains a challenge. When machines get clogged, it leads to delays and increased costs. While grinding, milling and pelletizing have been done for decades with food, minerals and pharmaceuticals, there has been little research into how technologies and processes can be adapted to handle plant materials and municipal solid waste. Now, researchers at the Idaho National Laboratory have developed computer models that apply to processing bioenergy crops using equipment from those other industries.

BETO funded the project through the Feedstock-Conversion Interface Consortium. With the help of advanced computer programs, bioenergy researchers can now make better predictions by looking at lots of complex data and finding patterns.

“It helps engineers design better milling approaches that are more energy efficient and effective,” said Yidong Xia, senior research scientist in INL’s Physical Process Science and Realization group. In three journal articles, Xia and his colleagues detailed how existing and emerging computational tools can be used to solve challenges related to feedstock particle size, distribution and thermochemical conversion.

Focus on corn stover

The INL team processed corn stover, which is the stalks, leaves, husks and cobs left over after corn is harvested. Researchers used special cutting techniques to turn corn stover into material that can be processed evenly. Unlike rocks and powders, which can be milled into relative uniformity because of their density and rigidity, the material properties of individual biomass particles have complicated internal and surface structures. Inside industrial-scale biomass silos and screw conveyors, there can be millions of particles with a wide range of geometries and properties.

Located in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Biomass Feedstock National User Facility, INL’s Process Development Unit lets researchers and industry partners test grinding, drying, pelletizing and other mechanical and chemical separation options during the design and scale-up of bioenergy facilities.

“Our purpose is to share our expertise and facilities to help our industry partners better understand the complex interactions that go on at industrial scales,” said Damon Hartley, a senior bioenergy research scientist. “This provides simplified and actionable information that can be utilized to improve operational performance.”

Faster estimates for guiding physical operations

Their April 2022 paper in Biosystems Engineering detailed the elastoplastic flexural behavior known as elastoplasticity of corn stalks. Elastoplasticity describes how a material that is both elastic (returns to its original shape) and plastic (permanently deforms) bends under a load. A December 2023 follow-up paper in Biosystems Engineering detailed how discrete element method modeling revealed that while stalk length had little influence on particle size, larger cross sections generated larger milled particles. From there, Xia’s team conducted biomass size reduction experiments with the PDU’s knife mill. The study published in May 2024 in Powder Technology shows how using advanced computer models can help predict and recommend the best settings for equipment to reduce the size of particles.

The experiments provided insight into how fast estimates of particle size distribution can be used to guide physical operations. A model’s accuracy depends on the quality of the source data from physical testing. The more source data there is, the more reliable the model.

“First, we measure the cornstalks’ biomechanical properties,” Xia said. “Then we mill the material in the PDU to generate reference data as the basis to create a (discrete element method) simulation. From there, we can verify the data for use in fast predictive machine learning models.”

Assessing the data

Researchers found that the speed and power of the knife mill had minimal impact. Instead, the discharge screen size and moisture content played much more significant roles. With data in hand, the INL team developed a more comprehensive mathematical framework for predicting the evolution of particle size by adding moisture as a new input. Likewise, the deep neural operator model they developed allowed for influencing factors such as moisture content. Both models proved to be “remarkably accurate” in calibrating and defining training parameters.

“Large-scale physical testing is expensive and is a common challenge for scale-up engineering,” Xia said. “The more data we have ahead of time, and the more detail we have, the better our results are likely to be when we finally engage in large-scale testing.”

It’s a win-win for industry and BETO.

“Our industry partners have the expertise, but they might not be able to afford the sophisticated hardware and software tools needed to conduct this kind of research,” Xia said. “This is what national laboratories do. We’re here to help them optimize their processes and procedures, to help them be more successful. With the work we do, we hope to attract their interest and have them recognize our capabilities.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/INL_Nov25_1557f37af1.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 12:57:43.380555

He proudly pointed to a significant milestone: the first-ever sustainable aviation fuel facility using ethanol as its feedstock was built in Soperton, Georgia, and has recently reached commercial-scale production.","Geoff Cooper, CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), spoke with Intern Karleigh Erramouspe about the current market dynamics for U.S. ethanol, revealing record-setting export levels and highlighting a major new opportunity in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Legislative Roadblocks for E15

Cooper began by outlining the core function of the RFA: representing U.S. ethanol producers, who convert corn and grain sorghum into ethanol, and giving the industry a unified voice across the country.

The biggest hurdle for expanding domestic E15 sales (a blend of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline) remains legislative uncertainty. Currently, roughly 70% of the country cannot sell E15 year-round without a last-minute emergency waiver from the EPA.

“Really the biggest hurdle currently for nationwide year-round sales of E15 is we still don’t have legislation that allows the fuel to be sold year-round,” Cooper said.

This lack of certainty creates a massive disincentive for retailers to invest in the necessary infrastructure.

“If we don’t know whether we can sell this fuel year-round, you know, 365 days a year, we’re not going to make the investment in the infrastructure… to offer this product, if we can’t sell it every day of the year,” he explained, summarizing the retailer’s dilemma.

To solve this, Cooper stressed the urgent need for Congress to pass legislation allowing year-round E15 sales before the end of the year.

Record Exports and Trade Success

In stark contrast to the domestic regulatory hurdles, the ethanol industry is celebrating unprecedented success in the global marketplace.

“We’re actually seeing record exports in the ethanol industry. We’re expecting that this year about 2.4 billion gallons of ethanol will be exported, that will be an all-time record,” Cooper revealed.

This record volume means approximately 13% or 14% of total U.S. production is being exported.

Cooper noted that the industry has not seen adverse effects from recent tariff and trade disputes. In fact, ethanol has been front and center in the U.S. government’s trade negotiations. He specifically highlighted a recent success:

“The showpiece of that is is the trade deal that was done with the U.K. [United Kingdom]. The United Kingdom deal included a nice provision for ethanol that really expands our access to that market.”

A Huge Opportunity in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

The most exciting development for the industry is the emergence of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which promises to open an entirely new sector for corn-based ethanol.

Cooper detailed how ethanol is now being used as the foundational component for cleaner jet fuel.

“One of the things we’re we’re very focused on in the industry today is taking ethanol and using it as the building block for sustainable aviation fuel,” he said.

He proudly pointed to a significant milestone: the first-ever sustainable aviation fuel facility using ethanol as its feedstock was built in Soperton, Georgia, and has recently reached commercial-scale production.

“We think that’s a great sign and and and points to a bright future for the use of ethanol in the aviation sector,” Cooper concluded, noting that this is not a market the industry has previously played in, making it a “potentially a huge market opportunity” for ethanol producers and corn growers.",,N,,2025-11-26 10:58:17.707627

Producers must be able to show, with meters and records, that the amount of sustainable input matches the amount of sustainable fuel produced.
EU RED sets a high bar, and meeting it can be challenging, especially for emerging companies.","Imagine stepping into a plane that runs on recycled emissions, renewable electricity and water. That’s not a distant dream, but a direction aviation is moving in. Starting in 2030, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation requires that a share of all jet fuel used at EU airports must be synthetic, electricity-based sustainable aviation fuel called eSAF.

To ensure this fuel truly cuts emissions, the EU RED sets clear rules for how eSAF must be produced. These include strict control of supply chains, transparent tracking of sustainable materials, verified life-cycle emissions calculations, and a requirement that eSAF cuts emissions by at least 70 per cent compared to fossil-based jet fuel. In practice, this means eSAF producers must be certified before they can sell fuel in the EU.

Certified from source to sky

EU RED certification rests on three key requirements: sourcing sustainable inputs from approved suppliers, tracking material flows accurately through mass-balance, and verifying emissions across the full lifecycle.

Supply chain requirements

Every sustainable input used to produce eSAF, like captured biogenic CO₂ and green hydrogen, must come from EU RED-certified suppliers. Electricity providers don’t need certification themselves, but the electricity used must be genuinely renewable and, in many cases, meet strict criteria like being newly built, produced at the same time the fuel is made, and generated in the same region. These checks prevent eSAF production from competing with other sectors for renewable power.

Mass-balance tracking

In simple terms, the mass balance approach means that what goes in and what comes out during the production process is strictly accounted for. Producers must be able to show, with meters and records, that the amount of sustainable input matches the amount of sustainable fuel produced. This avoids situations where more “green” fuel is claimed than what is actually created.

Life-cycle emissions

To ensure real climate benefit, emissions are calculated across the whole journey from raw materials to fuel production, transport and final use. EU RED requires that eSAF cuts emissions by at least 70 per cent compared to fossil jet fuel, based on a standard EU formula.

Liquid Sun's path to certification

We have taken our first major step by becoming a member of the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) Association, one of the EU-approved schemes for demonstrating compliance with the EU RED. ISCC is widely trusted in the aviation and renewable energy sectors, making it a strong fit for our mission.

EU RED sets a high bar, and meeting it can be challenging, especially for emerging companies. But by joining ISCC early, we can build compliance into our processes from day one rather than retrofitting later. It gives us time to understand requirements, create the right systems and prepare for rigorous audits.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b87f17_48a13a0fb72e4d7392d0f19c6f5afd99~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_500,h_500,al_c,q_80/b87f17_48a13a0fb72e4d7392d0f19c6f5afd99~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-11-26 13:56:23.818849

Virgin Atlantic CEO Salary FAQs Stay tuned with us.","Virgin Atlantic (VS), one of the UK’s most iconic airlines, has always stood out for its flair, service, and daring marketing. Founded by Sir Richard Branson in 1984, it remains a symbol of British entrepreneurial spirit.

The airline’s story over the last few years, however, has been one of steady resilience rather than glamour. Having battled through the pandemic and rising fuel costs, Virgin Atlantic has managed to claw its way back to profitability under the leadership of Shai Weiss, who has been at the helm since 2019.

In 2024, the carrier recorded its first profit since 2019, reporting a £20 million pre-tax profit and revenues of £3.3 billion. The performance came on the back of strong demand on transatlantic routes, where Virgin Atlantic operates alongside its joint venture partners Delta Air Lines, Air France, and KLM.

Its operational fleet of around 42 aircraft, largely made up of Airbus A330s, A350s, and Boeing 787 Dreamliners, forms the core of a long-haul network connecting London to destinations across North America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia.

As the airline continues to stabilise, much attention has turned to the man guiding its comeback and, naturally, to how he’s compensated for the task.

Who is Shai Weiss?

Shai Weiss, originally from Israel, has been with Virgin Atlantic since 2014, starting as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) before being promoted to Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in 2019.

He previously held senior roles at Virgin Media and several investment firms, building his background across finance and management. Educated in both Israel and the United States, he holds an MBA from Columbia Business School.

Within Virgin Atlantic, Weiss is known for his pragmatic leadership and calm temperament, traits that proved vital during the pandemic years when the airline’s survival was in question.

His decision-making was instrumental in securing refinancing deals and driving the restructuring plan that saved thousands of jobs. Weiss is also known for his balanced approach — a mix of financial discipline and the brand’s characteristic optimism.

Virgin Atlantic CEO Shai Weiss’ Salary in 2025

As of the most recent disclosures, Shai Weiss’s base salary remains around £700,000 per year, consistent with his reported compensation since 2022. His performance-based bonus potential can reach up to £1.05 million, depending on how the airline performs financially and operationally.

Virgin Atlantic has not yet released a detailed remuneration report for the 2025 financial year. However, considering the airline’s return to profitability in 2024 and its positive earnings outlook, it’s expected that Weiss’s bonus component will have been partly or fully activated.

Based on comparable pay structures from previous years, his total estimated remuneration for 2025 likely falls between £1.2 million and £1.4 million, assuming moderate incentive payouts.

His package includes standard executive benefits such as health insurance, company car allowance, travel privileges, and participation in Virgin Group’s long-term incentive plan. Unlike some of his peers in low-cost or larger network airlines, Weiss’s compensation structure is heavily tied to long-term profitability rather than short-term stock bonuses.

Peer Comparisons: British Airways and easyJet

To understand Weiss’s compensation in context, it’s worth looking at two of his UK-based counterparts: Sean Doyle, CEO of British Airways, and Kenton Jarvis, CEO of easyJet.

Sean Doyle (British Airways) reportedly earned around £1.4 million in total remuneration in 2024, including a base salary of about £670,000 and bonus incentives.

BA’s size, being part of the International Airlines Group (IAG), naturally justifies a larger total pay envelope. The group’s profitability and global scale are also far higher than Virgin Atlantic’s.

Kenton Jarvis (easyJet), who assumed the CEO position in January 2025, earns a base salary of £800,000, with performance bonuses and share-based incentives tied to the airline’s financial results. His package is slightly higher on the fixed pay side but carries similar proportions in bonus opportunities.

Compared with these, Shai Weiss’s total compensation is competitive but restrained. Virgin Atlantic is smaller than both British Airways and easyJet in fleet and network scale, so the relative positioning of Weiss’s salary makes sense. What stands out is that his pay is deeply performance-weighted — an approach reflecting the airline’s cautious recovery and investor expectations.

Governance and Pay Structure

Virgin Atlantic’s remuneration philosophy has always leaned towards balance. As a privately held company (jointly owned by the Virgin Group with 51%, Delta Air Lines with 49%, and Air France-KLM with a small stake), its executive compensation is not subject to the same level of public scrutiny as listed airlines. Still, the board maintains a framework that rewards leadership stability and long-term financial health rather than large annual bonuses.

Following the challenges of 2020–2022, Weiss voluntarily waived parts of his pay and bonus when the airline was undergoing restructuring. That gesture earned him goodwill both internally and externally, reinforcing his image as a steady and grounded leader.

Since then, the company has re-aligned its bonus metrics towards profitability, cash flow, and operational reliability — three areas Weiss has openly prioritised. His pay for 2025, while not officially disclosed in full, is expected to reflect these performance goals more than headline figures.

Virgin Atlantic’s Plans for 2025

Looking ahead, Virgin Atlantic’s 2025 plans centre around sustainable expansion and financial strengthening. The airline is ramping up capacity on transatlantic routes, especially to the United States, where demand has remained robust.

It has also resumed services to key leisure destinations such as Dubai, Miami, and the Caribbean islands, while considering further frequency increases to India and South Africa.

Fleet modernisation continues, with the Airbus A330neo now joining the lineup, promising improved fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Sustainability sits at the heart of the company’s plans — Virgin Atlantic completed the world’s first 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) transatlantic flight in 2023 and is pushing forward with similar initiatives.

Operationally, the goal for 2025 is to achieve a stronger profit margin, improve punctuality, and manage rising fuel and maintenance costs. For Weiss, these objectives will directly influence any variable pay outcomes at the end of the fiscal year.

Bottom Line

Shai Weiss’s leadership has quietly stabilised Virgin Atlantic after a period of crisis and uncertainty. His pay structure reflects that measured, responsible approach — steady fixed compensation, and bonuses linked directly to the airline’s success. While not excessive by industry standards, it’s a fair reflection of the airline’s size, recovery stage, and ownership structure.

As Virgin Atlantic eyes a stronger 2025, Weiss’s role remains pivotal. His pay may not make headlines, but it symbolises a balance between ambition and realism — a fitting representation of how the airline itself has rebuilt from turbulence to renewed optimism.

This decision, which came into effect on Tuesday, November 25, 2025, marks the conclusion of an extensive investigation launched in June 2024 following an application by the Renewable Transport Fuels Association (RTFA).

The TRA's investigation determined that Chinese biodiesel was being ""dumped"" in the UK market—a practice that was found to be causing ""material injury"" to UK-based producers, including major industry players such as Argent Energy and Olleco.

The new measures are structured as ad valorem duties, which are calculated as a percentage of the value of the imported goods. The rates vary based on the level of cooperation shown by the exporting companies during the investigation:

• 14.79% for the Zhuoyue Group and other non-sampled cooperating exporters.

• 54.64% for all other exporters from China.

The application of these duties is broad, covering key types of biodiesel: fatty-acid mono-alkylesters (FAME) and paraffinic gasoils obtained from synthesis or hydrotreatment of non-fossil origin (HVO), whether imported in pure form or as part of a blend. This move aims to secure fair competition across the renewable road transport fuel sector.

Crucially, in a nod to future sustainability goals, the duties explicitly exclude sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), in pure form or in a blend.

The final recommendation by the TRA confirmed that applying an anti-dumping measure is decisively in the UK's economic interest. The authority's findings were based on a thorough analysis of evidence and responses from interested parties following the publication of the Statement of Essential Facts.

Engine and aircraft performance assessments, along with inspections, have delivered positive results.

“We are particularly pleased with these SAF flights in partnership with Bell,” said Jean-François Sauer, EVP Programs at Safran Helicopter Engines. “SAF plays a key role in making helicopter operations more sustainable. The Arrius 2R, like all our engines, can currently run on up to 50% drop-in SAF. Very soon, they will be capable of operating on 100% drop-in SAF, helping expand the use of this fuel across the sector.”

The Bell 505 combines the Safran Arrius 2R engine with dual-channel FADEC and the Garmin G1000H NXi all-glass avionics suite featuring a moving-map display. Its panoramic windows, open cabin layout and Synthetic Vision technology make it one of the most advanced aircraft in its class and suitable for a wide range of missions, including public safety, utility operations and military training.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-2.png,N,,2025-11-26 08:57:11.094212

To boost SAF production, Pertamina is working to increase the proportion of used cooking oil in its blends.
“This can also be achieved by increasing the capacity and productivity of the green refinery unit.” Indonesia has significant potential supply.
The country uses about 6 to 7 million tonnes of cooking oil each year, said Pertamina deputy president director Oki Muraza.
“In the beginning, we collected around 80 kg to 100 kg of used cooking oil a month.","Cilacap: Indonesia’s state-owned energy company Pertamina is intensifying efforts to scale up production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as part of the country’s broader plan to reduce carbon emissions from air travel, reports Channel News India.

Pertamina is expanding SAF output at its existing refineries and is studying the development of new green refineries. At present, SAF is produced at the company’s Cilacap refinery in Central Java, while green refinery capabilities are being developed or planned at facilities in South Sumatra, Riau, West Java and East Kalimantan.

The Indonesian government aims to raise the national SAF blend mandate for international flights to 5% by 2035. At the COP30 climate conference in Belem, Brazil, the country announced a target of producing more than 1 million kilolitres of SAF annually by 2030, with used cooking oil set to be a major feedstock.

At Cilacap, the green refinery under development can produce about 1.4 million litres of SAF a day — roughly half the volume of an Olympic-size swimming pool. Around 3% of the feedstock currently comes from used cooking oil.

The refinery converts used cooking oil into SAF using a series of chemical processes. The oil is mixed with kerosene, heated to about 70°C and then moved into a reactor where it is further heated to over 300°C and passed through layers of catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions. Hydrogen is also added to stabilise the mixture. The result is a cleaner fuel suitable for jet engines, which can cut aviation emissions by up to 80% compared with conventional jet fuel.

To boost SAF production, Pertamina is working to increase the proportion of used cooking oil in its blends. Engineers are also experimenting with improved catalysts to raise efficiency. The current catalyst was developed locally by Pertamina’s technology innovation team in collaboration with the Bandung Institute of Technology, as part of a national effort to reduce reliance on imported catalysts.

“Our research and development team is always trying to improve the catalyst so that the used cooking oil content can be increased to more than 3%,” said process engineer Novan Adhi Prakasa. “This can also be achieved by increasing the capacity and productivity of the green refinery unit.”

Indonesia has significant potential supply. The country uses about 6 to 7 million tonnes of cooking oil each year, said Pertamina deputy president director Oki Muraza. “If we could collect just 20% of that, like in developed countries, we would have a large amount of raw material — enough to supply the domestic industry.”

Communities are already contributing to the SAF supply chain. In the Tegalreja district near the Cilacap refinery, residents are selling their used cooking oil to local waste banks instead of discarding it. Each kilogram earns around US$0.30.

“Used cooking oil is something every household has. Selling it adds to our income. Even if it’s just a little, it helps,” said Bartinah, a resident of KB Gadis village. “It gives us motivation and hope that one day the price could rise even higher, maybe up to 10,000 rupiah (US$0.60) per kilogram.”

Indonesia has an estimated potential of around 1 million litres of used cooking oil annually, but nearly 95% of it is exported to Europe and other Asian markets. Local collection initiatives could redirect more of this toward domestic SAF production.

“In the beginning, we collected around 80 kg to 100 kg of used cooking oil a month. Now, it’s up to about 170 kg,” said Sri Widowati, coordinator of the Tegalreja Waste Bank.

This expanding community involvement, combined with Pertamina’s refinery upgrades, is expected to play a central role in Indonesia’s push to build a robust and scalable SAF ecosystem.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-9.png,N,,2025-11-26 08:57:18.350549

The company's Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Soperton, Georgia, is now fully operational, marking the first time its alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology has been deployed at a commercial scale following 15 years of research and development.

The fuel produced at the Georgia facility is a ‘drop-in’ solution, meaning it is fully compatible with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure and can be used as a direct replacement for traditional jet fuels.

This development could play a role in reducing the carbon footprint of the aviation industry. LanzaJet’s achievement is also notable as it represents the first time a non-oil-based renewable fuel of this type has reached commercial production levels.

Alcohol-to-jet manufacturing

Industry analysts have noted that SAF production using Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) may be nearing a limit based on feedstock availability. LanzaJet's technology offers an alternative pathway.

LanzaJet's proprietary process utilises widely available ethanol feedstocks, including agricultural residues and municipal solid waste, to bypass potential supply chain bottlenecks.

By focusing on ethanol, this technology could open up new avenues for waste and recycled carbon to be used in aviation fuel production.

""LanzaJet had made history: producing jet fuel from ethanol at the world's first commercial-scale plant,"" says Flyn van Ewijk, Regional Director for APAC at LanzaJet.

""This moment is not only hugely important for the LanzaJet family – the culmination of 15 years of research and development, collaboration, investment, and scale-up – but also for our industry as it marks the next wave of SAF technology to reach commercial readiness in nearly a decade.""

Scaling production with integrated technologies

LanzaJet refers to the Soperton plant as a ""first-of-its-kind"" integrated solution. The manufacturing process combines Technip Energies’ Hummingbird Ethanol-to-Ethylene technology with an oligomerisation process developed jointly by LanzaTech and the US Department of Energy.

The successful integration and troubleshooting of these technologies at the facility now serves as a blueprint for future deployments globally.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO at LanzaJet, comments: ""Today proves what happens when you bring together innovation, resilience, ingenuity and teamwork to think big and develop a new industry, overcome challenges and enable global growth.

“We’re now in a unique position with technology and operational know-how to shape this global industry in the decade ahead.”

Global implications for fuel manufacturing

LanzaJet is already working to deliver this manufacturing technology to several other regions, including the UK, the European Union, Japan, and Australia.

The move towards ethanol-based fuel production could offer nations a way to enhance their domestic energy security while also supporting their agricultural sectors.

The fuel produced through this process delivers substantially lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions when compared to conventional kerosene.

Flyn acknowledges the operational challenges faced during the project's development: ""Deploying a first-of-its-kind is not easy, but we've done it.

""I'm proud of our team for what they have achieved and grateful for Jimmy Samartzis's leadership and to Louay Masarweh for his many sleepless nights and unwavering dedication to the mission.""

During the Singapore Airshow four major aviation names signed the Global Sustainable Aviation Fuel Declaration. Airbus Rolls Royce Safran and Singapore Airlines endorsed the objective of rapidly increasing SAF production and use. The declaration is open for every airline and aerospace stakeholder to join, helping the sector align with Paris Agreement climate targets.

Why SAF truly matters

SAF can lower life cycle carbon emissions by up to eighty percent compared with traditional jet fuel. Because most existing aircraft can already operate with a fifty percent SAF blend, the solution delivers immediate impact without waiting for new airframes or engines. Airbus has pledged to certify its entire fleet for one hundred percent SAF by 2030, demonstrating that technical barriers are minimal and focus can shift to supply growth.

Collaboration unlocks scale

A notable feature of the declaration is its value chain approach. Manufacturers fuel producers airlines and policymakers are invited to coordinate investment calendars and policy frameworks so that refineries distribution networks and airport infrastructure expand together. This reduces risk for each participant, encouraging faster capital deployment.

Non-obvious insight

Airline demand signals alone are not enough; engine makers and airframers publicly backing SAF give financial institutions clear evidence that the technology will remain compatible with future aircraft architectures. As a result, long term fuel purchase agreements may secure lower interest rates, accelerating construction of first of a kind bio refineries.

What happens next

Signatories intend to publish transparent progress data annually. Singapore Airlines has indicated that early demonstration flights departing Changi Airport will feature higher blend levels, offering practical learning for regulators across the Asia Pacific region.

Conclusion

The Global SAF Declaration transforms isolated sustainability pledges into a united implementation roadmap, making commercial scale green aviation fuel a realistic near term prospect rather than a distant aspiration.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-9.svg,N,,2025-11-26 08:57:44.786246

The commencement of exports from the Simandou iron ore project is a potential game changer for the capesize market, whilst the cessation of Houthi attacks saw an upturn in Suez traffic, although a resumption of Somali pirate activity will see shipping kept on its toes in the Horn of Africa region. No month could pass without US politics filling the news agenda and this proved to be the case with the on/off argument over port fees taxing the mind of anyone involved in the transpacific trades. In amongst all this was the continued fallout from the previous month’s MEPC meeting whilst the COP 30 meeting in Brazil provided further depressing news for those hoping to see progress on climate action.

Ten years on from the Paris Accord, it really does look like the ‘Axis of Obstruction’ comprising those countries reluctant to quit fossil fuels is set to derail all the progress and the billions of dollars spent on addressing the climate change issue. On the eve of the COP 30 meeting, the International Energy Agency released a report advising that oil and gas demand will continue to rise for the next 25 years under a scenario “which reflects governments’ fading commitment to climate change” and further commented that it is now “all but certain that 1.5 degrees of warming will be exceeded within a decade or less and that the pathways that limit this overshoot to low levels are out of reach.’’

That crucial element which feeds the addiction to fossil fuels, the tanker market, is ending the year on a buoyant note. Newbuilding orders are being placed at a much accelerated rate. In many cases buyers are opting for the most efficient conventional propulsion systems rather than the more exotic options which have been touted over the past few years. Is the shipping industry, which has made huge strides in so many areas with energy saving devices and better voyage management, also now experiencing its own fading commitment to climate change?

There was plenty of optimism at the recent Bahri Week gathering of the tanker industry in Dubai. Despite actual fixtures during the event being a bit slower, with one broker report commenting that the mood was more “canapes than cargoes”, there were plenty of closed door discussions as owners and charterers jockeyed to position themselves in an ever changing geopolitical and regulatory environment.

As the tanker industry left Dubai, the next big event in the Middle East was the Dubai Airshow where an industry which is also grappling with it’s low carbon future put its wares on display, but again the main action was in discussions behind closed doors. In a preview of the airshow, the Monocle Minute described the aviation industry as “at a moment of flux in which technology is advancing faster than regulation can catch up” and further commented “the industry finally appears to be moving beyond platitudes and towards climate action instead…..still, the broader sector is in a bind: sustainable aviation fuel production is nowhere near scale. The airshow will present glimpses of a greener future but also lay bare just how far from that horizon the commercial fleet remains.”

All sounds familiar to our own industry? Perhaps the most optimistic words are that “technology is advancing faster than regulation can catch up”. Shipping is a much more fragmented sector than aviation, but if we can continue down a path where technology brings about the advances the regulators have failed to agree on but still provides material commercial savings to the participants, perhaps those green targets will become a little closer.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Maersk-Air-Cargo.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 06:56:11.395995

By mid-November, volumes rose from about 6 million tons in 2023 to about 7 million in 2024, reaching just over 10.3 million tons in 2025.","By Raphael Galo, Head of Agribusiness and Structured Operations at A7 Capital

For the U.S. producer looking at the 2025-26 crop after USDA’s WASDE reports resumed, the outlook for soybeans and corn in South America still appears “comfortable” in the official numbers, but once you dig into weather, costs and domestic demand, the safety margin looks much thinner than the headlines suggest.

In Brazil, soybean numbers keep climbing. CONAB’s second crop survey projects a record area of about 49 million hectares (+3.6% from the previous crop), with production estimated at 177.6016 million tons in 2025-26, slightly below the 171.4817 million tons of the 2024-25 cycle. USDA’s November WASDE, in turn, works with a Brazilian crop of 175 million tons, domestic use close to 63.3 million and exports around 112.5 million, cementing the country’s role as the world’s main supplier. These figures rest on still-reasonable conditions in Brazil’s Central-West, but behind them sits a more complex weather mosaic: climate reports point to a La Niña influence from late 2025 onward, with a tendency toward above-normal rainfall in parts of the Central-West and North, but a risk of irregular or below-normal volumes in southern Brazil and parts of Argentina and Paraguay, along with temperatures consistently above historical averages. That raises the odds of localized pockets of crop disappointment, especially in Rio Grande do Sul, Paraguay and northern Argentina, even if the national picture still looks comfortable.

In Mato Grosso, the main producing state, market reports show a soybean crop essentially fully planted (about 96.36% of area seeded, according to IMEA on Nov. 17, 2025), with good stand establishment in most regions. However, there are reports of spot replanting because of heavy rains or brief dry spells that created localized stress. The fast-planting pace supports expectations of more than 48-49 million tons of soybeans in the state, according to regional estimates, in line with CONAB’s view of a record national crop. At the same time, total production costs in Mato Grosso remain high: official cost-of-production estimates point to total outlays around R$8,000 per hectare (about US$1,506 per hectare at the Nov. 17, 2025, exchange rate) for the 2026-27 crop, with some relief on inputs such as seed and fertilizer, but higher operating and financial costs that keep margins tight at current price levels. That squeeze explains the defensive stance among many growers, who forward-sold a large portion of last season’s crop but are more cautious with 2025-26 sales, waiting for better windows in Chicago and in the foreign exchange market.

On the demand side, Brazil combines aggressive soybean exports in grain form — more than 100 million tons shipped between January and October 2025, with China accounting for more than 90% of monthly volumes at times — with growing domestic use. Meal demand remains strong, supported by record beef slaughter, rising hog and poultry slaughter and higher milk production, according to IBGE, which translates into solid feed demand across feedlots, hog and poultry operations, and dairy cooperatives nationwide. At the same time, a new biofuels policy is reinforcing demand for soybean oil: Brazil’s National Energy Policy Council raised the mandatory biodiesel blend in diesel from B14 to B15 as of Aug. 1, 2025, pushing projected biodiesel consumption to about 9.8 million cubic meters (+8-9% from 2024) and soybean-oil use to nearly 8 million tons. In parallel, the ethanol blend in gasoline was increased from 27% to 30% as part of an official strategy to reduce dependence on imported gasoline. In practice, this means a growing share of Brazil’s soybean crop is being locked in domestically through biodiesel and, increasingly, through renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, while meal and whole beans continue to anchor exports.

For corn, Brazil’s picture is one of high output but a much tighter balance once supply and demand are combined. CONAB’s second survey points to total production of about 141 million tons in 2024-25, with a small downward adjustment to about 138.8 million tons in 2025-26, despite increased area in both first and second crops. The decline comes mainly from more modest yield expectations after recent records. USDA’s November WASDE, however, projects 136 million tons for 2024-25 and 131 million for 2025-26 — in other words, a more cautious view of Brazil’s production potential. In both readings, the core point is the same: domestic use is growing rapidly. CONAB pegs Brazilian corn consumption at about 90.6 million tons in 2024-25, more than 7% growth year over year, with an additional 4-5% increase expected in 2025-26, driven by feed demand and, above all, the corn-ethanol boom. Official and industry reports indicate that ethanol from corn already accounts for roughly 20-25% of Brazil’s total ethanol output, having reached a bit over 8 billion liters in the Center-South in 2024-25, with strong expansion projected over the next decade as mandated ethanol blends rise and new plants come online.

This structural growth in domestic corn demand helps explain why, even with robust exports, Brazil’s balance sheet is not as loose as headline volume suggests. Trade data show shipments near 6.5 million tons in October and more than 23 million accumulated between July and October 2025, but projections for the 2024-25 cycle call for exports of around 40 million tons — and somewhat above that in 2025-26 — against a backdrop of rising internal consumption. At the ports, this translates into tighter basis: export-parity prices in the Central-West often run several reais below domestic cash prices, indicating that the internal market — especially corn-ethanol plants and feed mills — has become the main sponge for supply. In Mato Grosso, the state ag economics institute reports cash corn prices around R$46-47 per 60-kilogram sack in November, with B3 futures trading higher and export parity in the R$37-40 per-sack range, underscoring that domestic demand is supporting the market.

In Argentina, the picture is one of recovery with meaningful risks. After severe crop failures in 2022-23 and a still-uneven 2024-25 season, the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange and other local agencies project a total grain harvest of roughly 142-143 million tons in 2025-26, led by corn (about 58 million tons, +18% from the previous crop), while soybeans are expected to come in around 48-49 million tons, slightly below the prior season, mainly because of an estimated 4.3% reduction in area (totaling about 17.6 million hectares). In its most recent updates, the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange highlights delayed soybean planting: only about 13% of the area was sown by mid-November, compared with more than 20% at the same time last year, because of excess rainfall in parts of the core region and delays in Buenos Aires province. Initial production potential for soy sits near 47 million tons, but with significant uncertainty, as excessive moisture coexists with pockets of moisture deficit and heat in other areas. For corn, the situation is almost the mirror image: the same exchange reports planting progress around 36-37% of area, above last year, with good conditions in the fields already established, supporting projections for a strong crop. Overall, Argentina is reemerging as a relevant competitor in corn and soybean products (meal and oil), but the combination of La Niña, waterlogged soils in parts of the region and a recent history of sharp crop losses keeps weather risk above normal until the season is fully made.

Paraguay, meanwhile, is emerging as a quiet pivot in South American soy. International official reports project Paraguayan production at around 10.9 million tons in 2025-26, recovering from last season’s losses because of more favorable weather and modest gains in area and yield. Most of that volume still goes to export, either as whole beans or via crushing in plants in Paraguay itself, Brazil and Argentina. The country, however, faces structural challenges: rising costs, limited infrastructure, heavy reliance on river transport for exports and the need to adapt to regulations such as European Union deforestation rules, which could reshape regional soybean trade flows. Even so, a full Paraguayan crop adds seasonal downward pressure in a market already dependent on the Brazil-Argentina axis, reinforcing the idea that any supply shock in one of these players can be partially offset by the others.

From an international price standpoint, the recent environment has been one of explosive moves in Chicago. Soybean rallies — triggered by Chinese buying headlines, South American crop adjustments or technical buying — have at times pulled corn and wheat higher as well. Still, the November WASDE again cooled the bullish momentum by maintaining a view of reasonably comfortable global stocks. At the same time, South America keeps gaining share in global soybean trade — recent analysis shows the region consolidating control over the bulk of world exports — while China continues to diversify origins but remains heavily dependent on Brazil, Argentina and, to a lesser extent, Paraguay. In Brazil, domestic soybean cash prices in many regions are below what growers consider attractive relative to full production costs, which explains the slower pace of forward selling for the new crop, despite record shipments of the old one. The Brazilian real, which has strengthened since the start of the year, is also eroding export premiums in local currency, making FOB opportunities less compelling at the farm gate.

It is also important to remember that in China, the world’s largest soybean importer, port soybean stocks have clearly been rising year over year. At the end of October, stocks climbed from about 5 million tons in 2023 to about 8 million in 2024 and about 10 million tons in 2025. By mid-November, volumes rose from about 6 million tons in 2023 to about 7 million in 2024, reaching just over 10.3 million tons in 2025. This shows that Chinese ports are operating with record inventory levels for this time of year.

Finally, there is a policy and data component that cannot be ignored. In the United States, the end of the latest budget standoff only secured federal funding through early 2026, and there are indications that a full normalization of USDA’s publication calendar could face delays, precisely when the market needs reliable data to guide decisions. At the same time, Washington is debating tariff reductions on goods not produced domestically, such as coffee, signaling that trade and fiscal policy can quickly redraw the map of agricultural flows — a useful reminder for soybeans and corn, even if they are not at the center of these measures for now.

Qantas’ Vanessa Hudson, CBA CEO Matt Comyn and Origin chief executive Frank Calabria said it was important that business and government collaborated to create demand signals that would encourage markets to bring more sustainable options to customers.

“You need both supply and demand signals,” Qantas CEO Hudson said.

Fuelling more sustainable industries

There were major opportunities on offer for the nation in areas like sustainable aviation fuels, Hudson said. Long-haul commercial flights powered by anything other than liquid fuels were unlikely within our lifetimes, making alternative fuels vital in making flying sustainable.

“It takes a coalition of people and organisations to get that going,” she said. “The opportunity that we see is Australia has some of the largest sources of the feedstock for sustainable aviation in the world.”

That feedstock was currently being exported to Asia and then brought back to Australia as fuel, she said. “So this is an opportunity for us to potentially take a lead.”

Qantas was working with Queensland group Jet Zero to convert sugarcane waste to ethanol that could then be used to make sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, she said. It was also working with partners like Ampol to convert old fossil fuel infrastructure to support sustainable fuels.

“Aviation is an incredibly hard to abate industry, but that doesn't stop us being ambitious”.

Costs key for customers

Origin CEO Calabria said with substantial new infrastructure build required to support the transition, investing signals needed to be strong. The infrastructure build-out had the potential to be a game changer for national productivity, Calabria said, creating thousands of jobs.

Calabria said he preferred the term “energy expansion” to “energy transition” Rooftop solar had offset most new demand over the last decade, but data centres, EVs, and home electrification were changing the picture again, he said.

Managing energy was “no longer just buy commodity and manage risk”, he said. For example, there was now an enormous amount of “behind the meter” generation and storage happening on customer premises, he said.

While regulator focus was switching to security of supply, customers had costs at front of mind, he said. Attitudes to the transition also varied widely across the country “Regional people are feeling left behind,” he said.

CBA CEO Comyn echoed that sentiment, saying a conversation with customers in regional Queensland could be quite different to one with customers in metropolitan Melbourne when it came to sustainability.

CBA customers were also concerned with costs, Comyn said. “Cost pressures are coming through very strongly, much more than four or five years ago.”

Working together

Not everyone has the resources of big businesses to answer energy transition challenges, and businesses would need support Comyn said, saying CBA had provided $64.4bn in funding to businesses to help support sustainability initiatives since 2020.

But the CEOs agreed that the journey to sustainability carried challenges and costs.

“If Australia can get this right it puts us in a very strong position, but it’s challenging,” Comyn said. “We have to be engaging in the community and talking about the hard things.”

CBA’s role was to support and educate customers as well as finance them, he said. The bank is bringing a new electricity hedging product to market to help ease pressures in areas like pricing and reliability, Comyn said.

Fast follower

While all three CEOs agreed the sustainability transition was an economic opportunity for Australia, Hudson said we didn’t always need to be at the bleeding edge of that transition to be well positioned.

“Being a fast follower is a positive thing for Australia” she said, saying it provided the opportunity to look at what’s being done in other countries and make more informed decisions about our own path.

Qantas currently gets 70 per cent of its sustainable aviation fuel - which can cost up to three times as much as conventional fuel - from the US and particularly California, where demand was being encouraged and prices were starting to become comparable to fossil-based fuels, she said.

In contrast, Europe was leaning more towards a penalty-based system that discourages fossil fuel usage. Hudson said she found the US approach more appealing, but there were lessons Australia could learn from both sides of the Atlantic to encourage groups like Jet Zero to boost our own sustainability and security of supply.

Generation, a sustainable investment management firm, has published its 2025 Sustainability Trends Report examining the year's key developments in climate technology and policy.

The analysis highlights a divergence between political direction in some major economies and the continued expansion of renewable energy infrastructure and electric vehicle production.

Trade implications of policy shifts

The report documents changes in US federal climate policy under the Trump administration, including withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and steps to limit regulatory authority over greenhouse gas emissions.

According to Generation, these policy reversals have been linked to cancellations of nearly US$30bn in planned clean-industry investment in the US, with modelling suggesting potential investment losses could reach US$500bn over a decade.

This change appears to be creating opportunities for other manufacturing centres. China's industrial policy has positioned the country as a major exporter of renewable energy technology and electric vehicles, with the report noting that EVs already represent close to 60% of new car sales in China, compared to about 10% in the US in 2024.

The report describes China as a future ""electrostate"", with emissions potentially peaking well before the country's official 2030 target.

Supply chain developments in energy infrastructure

Global electricity generation from solar rose 28.3% last year, according to the report's analysis.

China added more solar capacity to its grid in a single month than any other country has built in an entire year, indicating the scale of manufacturing and installation supply chains now operational in that market.

Battery deployment is also affecting grid operations in some regions. In California, batteries meet about 20% of peak evening demand on some days, rising to about 30% in parts of Australia, displacing gas-fired generation during certain hours.

However, demand growth is complicating the picture.

EVs, heat pumps, data centres and air conditioning systems are pushing power demand growth towards 4% annually, almost double the long-term average. This has allowed fossil-fuel generation to rise, with coal's absolute usage remaining close to record highs, sustained by consumption in China and India even as these countries deploy new renewable capacity.

Transport sector and manufacturing competition

The International Energy Agency data cited in the report suggests electric cars are expected to account for 25% of global auto sales this year. Vehicles with plugs already constitute over half of new sales in China and about a quarter across Europe, indicating different rates of market penetration across major economies.

The US market shows a different pattern, with EVs making up only about 10% of sales in 2024. A modest increase is expected in 2025 as buyers move to access expiring subsidies before federal support programmes are potentially altered.

Tesla's market position has changed this year, particularly in Europe where the company has experienced double-digit sales declines in several markets. Chinese brands now offer models at lower price points, creating new competitive dynamics.

Electric lorry sales are rising from a small base, though infrastructure for high-power charging necessary for heavy goods vehicles remains at an early stage in most countries. Aviation and shipping remain further from decarbonisation targets, despite Europe's mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, which face financing challenges.

Negotiations for sustainable shipping legislation at the International Maritime Organization were adjourned this autumn, with the report noting that lobbyists from the US and Saudi Arabia played a role in the outcome.

Industrial supply chains and hydrogen projects

The report's analysis of hydrogen projects suggests a significant reassessment is underway.

A substantial portion of European projects have been cancelled and many more shelved as the cost gap with grey hydrogen remains wide.

The authors note that ""enthusiasm for hydrogen may have cost us years in which industrial decarbonisation could have been pursued by more practical means"", observing that early promotion came partly from oil majors.

Benchmark data indicates clean energy is attracting about twice as much investment globally as fossil fuels, with solar costs declining year-on-year since 2009, while gas-fired power costs have remained relatively stable.

Located in Abu Dhabi, the plant will covert around 500,000 tpy of waste into SAF, using a hybrid production pathway that combines renewable energy-powered electrolysis producing green hydrogen (H2) and waste gasification turning syngas into SAF through various proven chemical processes.

Once operational, the project is expected to serve multiple markets, positioning Abu Dhabi as a regional hub for SAF and supporting the decarbonization of a sector that accounted for over 18% of the UAE’s GDP in 2023, according to IATA data. SAF has the potential to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared with conventional jet fuel, according to International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates.

Fuels are the lifeblood of military operations. The resilience of fuel supply chains often determines who can move faster and more efficiently, fight longer and, ultimately, win the battle. Due to the renewed security risks on NATO’s Eastern Flank, there is a push to revitalise European fuel supply chains as essential ingredients for operational readiness.

It is essential to understand early on how the energy transition can be leveraged to enhance military effectiveness, considering the need for European Allies to revitalise fuel readiness while civilian decarbonization is reshaping the conditions of military operations. This report analyses challenges and opportunities of adopting alternative sustainable fuels across the air, land and maritime domains as of 2025.

The interdependence of civilian and military fuel infrastructure means that the energy transition will undoubtedly impact military fuel readiness. For this reason, this report identified and assessed challenges and opportunities of the civilian energy transition for military fuel readiness across the air, land and maritime domains as of 2025. Based on the analysis, the following five conclusions emerge:

The most important feature of a military fuel is its alignment with military performance requirements.

Changes in civilian fossil fuel availability and logistics infrastructure necessitate a reassessment of military fuel readiness.

The gradual adoption of domestically produced drop-in fuels can reduce dependence on oil imports, thereby enhancing supply chain resilience.

While it is in both the civilian and military sectors’ a near-term interest to increase adoption of drop-in fuels, the scale of this industry has not yet kicked-in.

Other alternative fuels such as synthetic and bio-based methanol and ammonia are not fit for military use.

Since completing Bangkok’s debut flight in November 2024 and launching the AAM Sandbox Initiative with continuous trial operations in October 2025, EHang has consistently advance the initiative with “safety first” approach.","EHang Holdings Limited (Nasdaq: EH) (""EHang"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in advanced air mobility (“AAM”) technology, today announced the successful launch of an urban human-carrying flight event in Bangkok with the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) and local partners, under the AAM Sandbox Initiative. Air Chief Marshal Manat Chavanaprayoon, Director General of CAAT, personally boarded and experienced the experimental flight, becoming the world’s first civil aviation authority chief globally to ride the pilotless EH216-S on an urban flight. This marks another milestone in EHang’s global AAM commercialization layout.

On November 24, EHang officially initiated the urban human-carrying flight event under the AAM Sandbox Initiative at the headquarters of Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), a Bangkok landmark located in the city’s central business district. The event received strong supports from senior Thai government officials, with distinguished attendees including Air Chief Marshal Manat Chavanaprayoon, Han Kok Juan, Director General of Singapore’s Civil Aviation Authority, Dr. Arak Sutivong, Deputy CEO of SCB X Public Company Limited, together with nearly 100 Thai business leaders and media representatives. Under widespread attention, the EH216-S completed a series of takeoffs and landings, as well as route flights. Air Chief Marshal Manat Chavanaprayoon and Dr. Arak Sutivong then boarded the EH216-S to experience a pilotless urban flight. The aircraft flew smoothly in the Bangkok’s core business district, with the Director General waving to audience, drawing extended applause.

These flights mark significant progress for the Thailand’s AAM Sandbox Initiative toward commercial operation and lay a solid foundation for EHang to deepen its presence in the Thai market and launch future commercial services. It also sets a benchmark for the path to commercialization of the AAM industry in Southeast Asia.

Under the support and oversight of the CAAT, the EHang work team, led by Senior Vice President Hu Longxuan, who oversees commercial operations department, dedicated full efforts to ensure the complete success of this flight event. This marked the first time EHang conducted overseas on-site demonstrations and validation of the EH216-S's comprehensive emergency scenario safety capabilities. During this collaboration, EHang and CAAT’s UAM team held in-depth discussions on four core pillars: flight safety, product technology, after-sales maintenance, and operating systems. Together they validated the EH216-S’s safety and commercial feasibility through nine extreme scenario tests and four dedicated technical exchanges. CAAT’s team expressed high recognition for EHang’s systematic support capabilities, including continuous airworthiness, full-lifecycle technical support, spare parts supply, professional talent training, and rapid maintenance support.

This overseas on-site demonstration and verification validated the EH216-S’s reliable performance under extreme conditions and its commercial operational readiness, highlighting EHang’s leadership in autonomous flying technology and end-to-end service capabilities. It establishes a solid technical foundation and regulatory trust, paving the way for the EH216-S to launch regular commercial operations under the Thailand’s AAM Sandbox Initiative.

As the world’s first pilotless human-carrying eVTOL company to obtain the Type Certificate, Production Certificate, and Standard Airworthiness Certificate from China’s Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC), EHang has identified Thailand as one of its core overseas strategic markets. Since completing Bangkok’s debut flight in November 2024 and launching the AAM Sandbox Initiative with continuous trial operations in October 2025, EHang has consistently advance the initiative with “safety first” approach. As a key achievement of Thailand’s Sandbox Initiative, the EH216-S not only maintained stable performance in point-to-point pilotless flight but also demonstrated strong adaptability to Bangkok’s traffic congestion and tourism scenarios across typical urban environments. According to plans, EHang will collaborate with local partners to gradually expand the sandbox area to popular destinations such as Pattaya, Phuket, and Koh Samui, building a diversified low-altitude route network covering urban commuting and aerial tourism.

Air Chief Marshal Manat Chavanaprayoon, Director General of CAAT, stated: “The advanced technology and autonomous safety performance demonstrated by the EH216-S are impressive. This flight demonstration represents not only a significant milestone in the development of AAM technologies which is expected to transform future air transportation systems, but forms part of Thailand’s ongoing efforts to become an Aviation Hub in the region. CAAT is committed to serving both as a regulator and a facilitator to ensure that modern aviation technologies can be safely and effectively implemented. We look forward to seeing Thailand achieve a breakthrough in establishing air routes connecting airports and urban areas. With the 2026 Advanced Air Mobility Symposium organized by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to be held in Thailand, we expect the country to become a global model for commercialization and large-scale development of AAM in 2026.

Luong Pham of Aerial Sea venture, supporting organization for the event, commented: “The EH216-S’s successful flight at core Bangkok landmarks such as the royal-owned SCB headquarters, coupled with the CAAT Director General’s personal participation, not only represents authoritative recognition of cutting-edge autonomous technology but also highlights Thailand’s strategic vision and commitment to embracing transportation innovation and developing its AAM ecosystem.”

Conor Yang, Chief Financial Officer of EHang, emphasized: “This event represents a key practical achievement of EHang’s overseas strategy. By continuously advancing human-carrying flights under the Sandbox Initiative in core urban scenarios such as Bangkok, EHang will further assist the Thai government and CAAT in improving Thailand’s AAM operation and regulatory framework.With the support of the CAAT, Thailand is highly likely to achieve the world’s first commercial eVTOL operations using an innovative regulatory approach of “sandbox”, creating a demonstration model for Southeast Asia and the world. EHang will continue to provide advanced integrated air mobility solutions to benefit more countries across the globe.”",https://www.asdnews.com/NewsImages/b/94859/102721_O.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 06:56:42.140746

Riyadh Air has a larger order for the Dreamliner at 39 firm commitments and 33 options.","Saudi Arabia's second flag carrier made headlines last month when it embarked on its first flight. A 787 took off from Riyadh, touching down at London Heathrow at sunrise. With funding secured, the carrier is now looking at global expansion, hoping to cover 100 destinations by 2030. Part of this expansion will come from the carrier's order for Airbus A350-1000 widebody jets, set to be powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines.

The order, made at Paris Air Show, includes an even split of firm commitments and options, and it will be fascinating to see how many of these options are taken over the next several years. In this article, learn more about the order and what it will mean for Riyadh Air, Airbus and Rolls-Royce. We then cover where they might fly and more on the carrier's first flights, making use of a second-hand 787 Dreamliner.

What Aircraft Are In The Order?

In June 2025, Riyadh Air put in an order for 50 Airbus A350-1000 widebody aircraft at the Paris Air Show. It was completed at a signing ceremony at Paris Le Bourget today, by Riyadh Air Chief Financial Officer Adam Boukadida and Airbus EVP Sales of Commercial Aircraft Business, Benoît de Saint-Exupéry. Also present was PIF Governor and Riyadh Air Chairman His Excellency Yasir Al-Rumayyan, CEO of Riyadh Air Tony Douglas and CEO of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, Christian Scherer.

It entails 25 firm commitments and 25 options, which would bring the new Saudi Arabian carrier's fleet up to 182 aircraft, should all the options be filled. Tony Douglas, the carrier's CEO, said: ""Riyadh Air is making significant progress as we move towards our first flight later this year and agreeing this deal for up to 50 Airbus A350-1000 aircraft is an important statement of intent.""

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus EVP Sales of the Commercial Aircraft business, was also optimistic about how the order could help Riyadh Air's development and build a partnership between the carrier and Airbus. He said: ""We are proud to extend our strategic partnership with Riyadh Air as it continues to build a pioneering carrier for the Kingdom. As the long-range leader, the A350-1000 will provide unrivalled efficiency, range and passenger comfort, making it the ideal choice to support the airline’s ambitious growth plans.""

The order also connects Riyadh Air to Sustainable Aviation Fuel, as the A350-1000, like all modern Airbus jets, can operate with a 50% SAF blend. This would seem to be a contradiction to Saudi Arabia's oil-based economy, which produced 12.4 million barrels of oil per day in 2024. It will be interesting to see if the carrier uses its new jets SAF capabilities or sticks with locally sourced oil-based aviation fuel.

The Jets Will Be Rolls-Royce Powered

The order from Riyadh Air is also a boost for Rolls-Royce as the jets will be powered by Trent XWB-97 engines. The British manufacturer, therefore, adds at least 50 engines to its order sheet, raising it to 100 if the options become commitments. Rob Watson, President, Civil Aerospace, Rolls-Royce, said:

""We’re looking forward to supporting the significant growth ambitions of Riyadh Air in its launch year. The Trent XWB-97 is an incredible engine and our TotalCare package will provide operational certainty across the fleet. The engine will benefit from the £1bn investment we’re making to the Trent engine family that improves their durability and efficiency across all operations. We look forward to supporting these new aircraft as they enter service.”

The table below includes specifications for the Trent XWB-97 engine according to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) type-certificate data sheet:

The agreement goes beyond simply providing the Trent XWB engines. Rolls-Royce and the airline have also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that commits the manufacturer to provide its comprehensive TotalCare service to keep the engines in working order.

What Is Riyadh Air?

Riyadh Air is a new Saudi Arabian flag carrier founded by Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The carrier's hub is at King Khalid International Airport, and it aims to find its place on the global market. The fleet consists of Airbus A321neo narrowbody aircraft, and Airbus A350-100 and Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner widebody aircraft. As with many Saudi infrastructure projects, the carrier is owned by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF). At the carrier's head is CEO Tony Douglas, who was previously CEO of Etihad Airways from 2018 to 2022.

It has ties to both SkyTeam and Star Alliance through a host of cooperation agreements, including with China Eastern Airlines, Saudi, Virgin Atlantic, Turkish Airlines and Singapore Airlines. Its current non-Saudi destination is London Heathrow. His Excellency Yasir Al-Rumayyan, PIF Governor and Chairman of Riyadh Air, described the importance of the carrier to the Saudi economy: ""Our new national carrier is set to take to the skies in the near future, and as a fundamental element of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s infrastructure, will connect our capital city to over 100 international destinations around the globe by 2030.""

Riyadh Air could form a significant part of the Middle Eastern nation's non-oil economy, which it will surely have to transition towards amid climate change and the inevitable exhaustion of reserves. It is predicted that the carrier will eventually add $20 billion to the nation's GDP and provide 200,000 direct and indirect jobs.

Where Will Riyadh Air's A350s Fly?

There have been no significant announcements of specific A350-1000 routes for Saudi Arabia's new flag carrier. However, we can assume, due to the aircraft's range and capacity, that the jet will fly to destinations in Asia and Europe. The carrier's first flights are planned to fly from Riyadh to European cities like London. They will then fly back to an alternative Saudi destination. An example could be Riyadh, as the A350 will then return to Riyadh to restart the cycle.

The clear limitation of Riyadh Air's network will be its fleet size while it waits for deliveries to be fulfilled. There have been no announcements of when the A350s will start to arrive, but we can assume they won't come for a few years. By this time, the network should be well established.

Riyadh Air expects to receive a new aircraft every month, which it will use to serve two new destinations each month. By 2030, the carrier expects to serve the major capital cities in Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East. While the network grows, its host of strategic partnerships, including code-sharing agreements, will facilitate further expansion.

Riyadh Air Takes To The Skies

Following delays in the carrier's 787 deliveries, which pushed the first flight back, Riyadh Air has now taken to the skies. In October 2026, it flew its new Boeing 787 Dreamliner, taking off from Riyadh at 3.26 am, and touching down at London Heathrow at 7.14 am. The flight made use of HZ-RXX, named Jamila, which was the carrier's only aircraft. The jet had previously been owned by Oman Air. This flight opened up the route to London Heathrow and it was not bookable by the public.

Instead, it carried an unknown number of the carrier and PIF's employees. These early flights aren't about making money, but about securing and maintaining competitive slots at London Heathrow. Tony Douglas, Riyadh's CEO, explained the reasoning for such a limited launch: ""If you go big bang on day one and assume everything will work perfectly on the first day, well, the reality is it won't. So we will use that short period to trial everything and make sure the feedback gives us the opportunity to polish every last little detail before I actually sell a ticket to you.""

The route to London Heathrow is set to become one of Riyadh Air's most frequent and important routes. Once its 787s start arriving, four by the end of 2025, the carrier should operate the route daily. This may increase further once the A350s start to arrive, although that will be dependent on the carrier securing additional slots.

It is unsurprising that the 787, rather than the A350, flew the carrier's first route. Riyadh Air has a larger order for the Dreamliner at 39 firm commitments and 33 options. More Boeing 787s should arrive soon, as its first purpose-built custom 787 rolled out of the paint shop in September and a second was finished soon after.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/latest.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-26 06:56:53.662175

“Tailings reprocessing offers genuine benefits, reducing pressure for new mining [and] addressing existing environmental liabilities,” said Mathikoza Dube, an expert on critical minerals based in Rustenburg.
New technology boosts metal recovery in waste New reprocessing technology has made it economically viable to extract platinum group metals from tailings, and several operations are already underway in South Africa’s platinum mining belt, around the city of Rustenburg.
“Reprocessing tailings does not erase the damage that created them.
My husband died of lung disease at 54.” Like many of her neighbours, she says any new cycle of mining activity – this time in the name of the clean energy transition – must not repeat the past.","Besides the dust that cloaks pathways, windowsills and gardens, the towering grey heaps of discarded rock are another unwelcome reminder of the platinum mine next door to the South African township of Chaneng.

In and around the city of Rustenburg, the low-grade platinum ore that has made South Africa the world’s top producer of the silvery metal creates massive waste piled in large rocky heaps known as tailings. For every tonne of metal extracted, hundreds of tonnes of waste rock is left behind in huge piles.

The transition to cleaner energy system is expected to push up global demand for platinum group metals (PGM) – which include palladium and other precious metals, as well as platinum. They are used in hydrogen-related technologies such as fuel cells and electrolysers that split water molecules as well as in hybrid cars that need catalytic converters to curb pollution.

To secure supplies, mining companies are starting to make use of what was once considered waste.

Efforts to green lithium extraction face scrutiny over water use

Reprocessing mine tailings using new technology can be a more sustainable form of producing minerals and metals needed for the energy transition because it is expected to reduce the size of existing waste heaps and boost output without the need to open new mines, which can cause more environmental destruction and community displacement.

“Tailings reprocessing offers genuine benefits, reducing pressure for new mining [and] addressing existing environmental liabilities,” said Mathikoza Dube, an expert on critical minerals based in Rustenburg.

“It offers the world a pathway to secure supplies of energy transition minerals while remediating waste that’s contaminated communities for generations,” Dube added, cautioning it is not a “magic solution” and should be approached in a way that ensures local communities benefit.

In Chaneng, where the tailings dumps loom over backyards, residents are wary.

“Same theft in new clothes”

They fear the plan to reprocess mining tailings at the neighbouring mine – operated by South African platinum miner Sibanye-Stillwater – is being dressed up as sustainable when in reality it will mean more contamination, blasting, dust and no end to their community’s problems.

Despite decades of mining, unemployment in the area remains high, many people say they never received compensation for the loss of their agricultural land and most households still lack access to basic sanitation infrastructure.

Water testing carried out by SRK Consulting in 2009 found elevated nitrate levels exceeding World Health Organization guidelines in community boreholes, and health practitioners document dramatic increases in respiratory diseases.

“Now they want to dig up the waste piles and call it progress? Show us the ownership papers. Show us the rehabilitation plan. Otherwise, it’s the same theft in new clothes,” said Johannes Kgomo, a community leader.

South Africa’s mining legislation requires that 26% of mining assets are held by historically disadvantaged people including Black South Africans, and Chaneng residents are demanding a stake of 15% to 30% in any tailings operation on their land, allowing them to have a say in how the business is run.

They say that should be granted to them as compensation for the health and environmental problems they have endured as a result of the mine.

The community is also demanding comprehensive water testing and treatment, adequately resourced clinics with respiratory specialists, compensation for destroyed agricultural land, infrastructure repair and long-term health monitoring.

“We are not asking for handouts,” said Gideon Chitanga of the National Union of Mineworkers, which often takes the side of local communities in disputes with companies.

“These people have already paid with their health, their water, their land. That contamination, that suffering – that is their investment. Now they want returns and decision-making power,” Chitanga added.

A spokesperson for Sibanye-Stillwater declined to comment.

A mining industry source, who asked not to be identified, said conversations with community members were ongoing.

“Nobody disputes these communities have suffered. The question is how to structure ownership in a way that’s legally sound, financially viable, and genuinely empowering,” the source said.

New technology boosts metal recovery in waste

New reprocessing technology has made it economically viable to extract platinum group metals from tailings, and several operations are already underway in South Africa’s platinum mining belt, around the city of Rustenburg.

Sibanye-Stillwater already operates multiple retreatment facilities, processing thousands of tonnes of waste ore monthly.

Another South African miner Tharisa processes chromite from PGM tailings commercially. Chromite is used to obtain chromium, a metal used in the manufacture of wind turbines and some energy storage batteries.

“Historical tailings facilities contain economically viable concentrations that were unrecoverable with older technology,” said Leo Vonopartis from the University of the Witwatersrand’s BUGEMET research programme, which studies the geology of South Africa’s Bushveld Complex mining belt.

Tailings in the area around Rustenburg can contain up to 2.5 grammes per tonne of combined platinum, palladium and rhodium – along with chromite. Vanadium, cobalt and rare earth elements have also been found.

At current prices, which have rallied this year, it is worth extracting the rare metals, despite the challenges.

Breaking with the cycle of extraction and injustice

“The technology exists. The economics work. The question is whether we can structure these projects to genuinely benefit the people who have paid mining’s costs,” a spokesperson for one mining company said, asking not to be named.

Without that, local expert Dube said, the reprocessing of tailings is scarcely better than other forms of mining.

“Reprocessing tailings does not erase the damage that created them. If it is structured as extraction by another name – where companies profit and communities remain marginalised – we have just found a new way to perpetuate old injustices.”

Australia’s COP31 Co-President vows to fight alongside Pacific for a fossil fuel transition

Gesturing toward the tailings dam visible from her yard, Noxolo Mthembu recalls the days when her vegetable patch used to feed the family.

“We used to grow spinach, tomatoes, pumpkins,” she told Climate Home News. “Now nothing grows. The dust kills everything. My children have asthma. My husband died of lung disease at 54.”

Like many of her neighbours, she says any new cycle of mining activity – this time in the name of the clean energy transition – must not repeat the past.

“Show me the ownership papers with our names. Show me the water treatment plant. Show me the clinic with enough staff. Then I will believe this time is different.”",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/11/IMG_2687-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-26 06:57:19.832234

The Government’s position is clear: expansion at Heathrow must be cost-effective, minimising the burden on passengers and coming at no cost to the taxpayer.
We know we must provide as much clarity and certainty for communities affected by expansion at Heathrow, as soon as possible.
Airports National Policy Statement Review The airports national policy statement provides the policy framework for the Government’s approach to securing additional airport capacity in the south-east of England.
We have begun detailed analytical and policy work to this effect.","Further to my oral statement to the House on 22 October, I am writing to update the House on the Government’s decision to identify the scheme promoted by Heathrow Airport Ltd as the scheme to take forward in informing the ongoing review of the airports national policy statement over the coming months. Any resulting proposed amendment to the ANPS, along with any other proposed amendments, will be subject to public consultation.

This decision marks an important milestone, one that reaffirms the UK’s commitment to maintaining its position as a world leader in aviation, innovation and economic growth. Heathrow is our only hub airport, which supports trade, tourism and hundreds of thousands of jobs, and underpins prosperity across both the south-east and regions of the United Kingdom. If Britain is to remain competitive in the decades ahead, we must ensure that our airport capacity matches our ambition as a modern, outward-looking and confident nation.

The Government’s position is clear: expansion at Heathrow must be cost-effective, minimising the burden on passengers and coming at no cost to the taxpayer. The project will be privately financed, including the core scheme and any associated surface access improvements.

Crucially, expansion must be delivered in a way that aligns with our legal obligations on air quality, environmental protection, noise and climate change.

We recognise that expansion brings both opportunity and responsibility. My Department will therefore continue to work closely with the Civil Aviation Authority, local authorities, community representatives and the wider aviation sector to ensure any scheme is delivered transparently, responsibly and in partnership with those it affects.

Assessment of proposals

Following my update last month to confirm that two proposed schemes remained under active consideration, my Department has now undertaken a further assessment of those two proposed schemes—Heathrow Airport Ltd and Arora Group-Heathrow West Ltd. I would like to thank both promoters of the proposed schemes for providing this additional information, and for their constructive engagement with my Department.

Following a comparative assessment of the remaining proposals for Heathrow expansion, the Government’s view is that the north-west runway scheme brought forward by Heathrow Airport Ltd offers the most credible and deliverable option, principally due to the relative maturity of its proposal, the comparative level of confidence in the feasibility and resilience of its surface access plans, and the stronger comfort it provides in relation to the efficient, resilient and sustainable operations of the airport over the long-term.

The HAL scheme is considered comparatively more mature in its approach to road infrastructure. While the HAL scheme requires major works to the M25, assessment indicates that the HWL scheme would also have a considerable impact on the M25.

We know we must provide as much clarity and certainty for communities affected by expansion at Heathrow, as soon as possible. While HAL’s scheme requires more land, it would require the acquisition of fewer residential properties around the airport than HWL’s scheme.

The runway length proposed by HAL—up to 3.5 km —is considered to be advantageous in terms of providing greater resilience and potential futureproofing for next-generation aircraft when compared with the 2.8 km runway proposed by HWL.

The Government therefore consider that overall, the HAL scheme provides the greatest likelihood of meeting our ambition for a decision on development consent application within this Parliament. This scheme will now inform the ongoing ANPS review. Any scheme identified in an amended ANPS will still need detailed consideration—including matters such as runway length, layout and supporting infrastructure—in any development consent order sought under planning legislation.

Airports National Policy Statement Review

The airports national policy statement provides the policy framework for the Government’s approach to securing additional airport capacity in the south-east of England.

I announced on 22 October that it would be reviewed, particularly to consider updated aviation forecasts and how any changes in policy and legislation—in particular relating to climate and the environment—since its designation in 2018 may need to be reflected, as well as how the Government’s four tests will be applied to expansion. We have begun detailed analytical and policy work to this effect.

Further to this, today I am publishing the Government’s stakeholder engagement approach. This represents an important step in ensuring that the development and review of the ANPS is conducted in a manner that is transparent, inclusive, and informed by a comprehensive range of stakeholder views.

I have always been clear that any proposals for airport expansion must meet the Government’s four tests, including those relating to climate commitments. I am confirming that I have today written to the Climate Change Committee setting out how I intend to engage with it, so that its views can be fully considered as this process progresses.

Regulatory work

As I said in October, rigorous and effective cost control will be essential to the scheme’s success both in minimising any impact on airline charges and costs to passengers and in maintaining credibility with financial markets.

The Civil Aviation Authority is continuing its work to develop the regulatory framework that will support delivery of expansion at Heathrow. It will shortly set out further detail on its approach to early cost recovery by promoters and is today publishing a paper setting out potential future regulatory options for an expanded Heathrow. The Government welcome this work and will continue to co-ordinate closely with the regulator to ensure that any new regulatory framework supports the timely and efficient financing of expansion and, in line with the CAA’s statutory duties, that passengers’ interests are protected and the best possible value is delivered.

This ongoing collaboration between Government and the CAA will continue to align regulatory and policy frameworks as the ANPS review progresses. The Department has a clear interest in ensuring the best possible value and service for passengers and will continue to review the CAA’s independent assessment of regulatory options to achieve this.

Broader programme progress

As we set out in October, the Government have acted in a range of areas that will enable expansion at Heathrow, including through the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, our work on judicial reviews, and the initiation of slot reform. Since October, we have continued to make progress on policies that enable the delivery of an operational third runway at Heathrow.

On airspace modernisation, the Department is today launching a consultation on a package of changes to help streamline airspace design while retaining the important principles of a transparent, evidence-based airspace change process.

Alongside this, we continue to make progress on work to decarbonise aviation, including increasing the uptake of sustainable aviation fuel, and innovation in aviation technology.

This is a historic opportunity for the UK aviation sector and wider economy. The Government are committed to ensuring expansion is delivered in a timely, cost-efficient, and environmentally responsible way, and we will consult on any amendments to the ANPS by July 2026.

Key highlights from the report for corporate travel programmes to consider include:

Risks and mitigation strategies

In 2026, as the global effects of tariffs continue to unfold, Oxford Economics believes the world may face its weakest economic growth since 2009 (excluding 2020), hovering at 2.6%. Inflation is expected to ease only slowly, averaging above 3%. In addition to this economic fragility, a broad range of risks may further compound the efforts of organisations to keep their business travellers safe and operations flowing smoothly.

The primary six risks to consider are extreme weather, regional tensions and ongoing conflicts, changing border policies, the rise of cyberattacks and misinformation arising from the use of AI, the continuing threat of illnesses and disease, and limited options for accommodations and ground transportation during large scale events.

Airfares

Overall, global airfares should see only limited inflation, primarily stimulated by the intercontinental air travel market as opposed to regional travel.

Globally, average ticket prices (ATPs) should rise by only 1.1% in 2026 reflecting weak airfares inflation in the Americas, and in North America especially. ATP increases in other regions should be above the global average, with the strongest inflation likely in Africa and Asia, at 2.5% and 2.0%, respectively.

In addition to airfare changes, the Global Air Practice at BCD’s Advito consultancy has identified five trends for travel buyers to keep in mind. These include a reduction in value of airline corporate contracts, cost avoidance, rising airline fuel surcharges, blanket NDC offerings, and continued travel programme leakage.

Hotel rates

Global hotel rates are forecasted to increase by 4.9% in average daily rates. There are many variables behind the variation in rates in different regions, from rising staffing and labor costs in Turkey to robust leisure demand in Japan. Aggregate figures for rate inflation in Africa, Asia and Europe should all lie within a narrow 4 to 6% range; the strongest rate inflation is expected across the Middle East at 8%. Hotels in Latin America are expected to average 6.4% in 2026. Rate inflation is likely to be weakest in the South-west Pacific and North America, at 2.6% and 2.2%, respectively.

Car rental

Car rental rates will generally continue to rise for corporate customers. A mix of aspects are contributing to this increase, including car rental companies’ acquisition and repair costs, city surcharges and higher parking rates. Corporate travellers are being forced to consider alternative options such as ride-hailing and taxis. In general, BCD expects rate increases in 2026 to be slightly lower than in 2025, sitting in a 2-4% range.

Sustainability

In 2026, sustainability will no longer be just a moral obligation. It is becoming a strategic business priority and a source of competitive advantage. Accountability will dominate the agenda as companies move from pledges to measurable action. According to GBTA’s latest benchmark, overall maturity remains low at 1.4 out of 5, with only 9% of companies applying carbon fees and 15% investing in sustainable aviation fuel.",https://ttgmice.2017.ttgasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/BCD-Travel-Outlook-2026_640.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 06:57:36.035825

The EIB, EBRD, and AfDB express their commitment to advancing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and cleaner energy projects in Africa. This aligns with the global aviation goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, supported by the ICAO Global Framework for SAF.

Regulatory Frameworks

The European Union adopted the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation in October 2023, while the African Union introduced a Continental Strategy for SAF in February 2025. The EU Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, launched in November 2025, emphasizes EU-Africa cooperation on SAF.

Economic and Environmental Impact

SAF is identified as a key driver for aviation decarbonization and economic growth, offering job creation and development opportunities for African states. Current production levels are low, necessitating global efforts to scale up SAF production and deployment.

Global Gateway Initiative

Supporting SAF development in Africa, Latin America/Caribbean, and Asia-Pacific is a Global Gateway flagship initiative. A coordinated effort by Team Europe aims to enhance market access and secure renewable fuel imports, aligning with the Global Europe regulation proposal.

The company plans to expand SAF production capacity at its existing refineries and is exploring the possibility of building new green refineries.

Currently, SAF is being produced at Pertamina’s Cilacap refinery in Central Java, and the company is either developing or planning green refinery capabilities to make such fuel at its facilities in South Sumatra, Riau, West Java and East Kalimantan.

The Indonesian government aims to raise the national SAF blend mandate for international flights to 5 per cent by 2035.

At the recent United Nations climate conference (COP30) in Belem, Brazil, Indonesia said it aims to produce over 1 million kilolitres of SAF annually by 2030, with used cooking oil as a key feedstock.

TURNING USED COOKING OIL INTO JET FUEL

Pertamina’s Cilacap facility is the largest oil refinery in the country, processing 348,000 barrels of crude oil per day and supplying roughly a third of Indonesia’s fuel needs.

It is being developed into a green refinery to produce sustainable aviation fuel, and can yield about 1.4 million litres a day – roughly half the volume of an Olympic-size swimming pool.

About 3 per cent of that comes from used cooking oil.

The refinery converts the used cooking oil into SAF through several chemical processes.

The oil is mixed with kerosene, heated to around 70°C, then transferred to a reactor where it is further heated to over 300°C and passed through layers of catalysts, which trigger and speed up chemical reactions.

Hydrogen is added to stabilise the mixture.

The result is a cleaner fuel suitable for jet engines, while cutting aviation’s carbon footprint by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel.

SCALING UP GREEN REFINERY CAPACITY

To increase Indonesia’s SAF output, Pertamina is working to raise the proportion of used cooking oil in its fuel blends.

Its engineers are also experimenting with catalyst improvements to increase production efficiency.

The current catalyst was developed by Indonesian scientists from Pertamina's technology innovation division in partnership with the Bandung Institute of Technology.

Developing a homegrown catalyst is part of a national initiative to reduce the country’s dependence on imported catalysts.

""Our research and development team is always trying to improve the catalyst so that the used cooking oil content can be increased to more than 3 per cent,"" said process engineer Novan Adhi Prakasa. ""This can also be achieved by increasing the capacity and productivity of the green refinery unit.""

Indonesia’s potential supply of used cooking oil is significant. The country uses about 6 to 7 million tonnes of cooking oil every year, said Pertamina’s deputy president director Oki Muraza.

“If we could collect just 20 per cent of that, like in developed countries, we would have a large amount of raw material – enough to supply the domestic industry.”

FROM KITCHEN WASTE TO CASH

Local communities are already contributing to this growing green supply chain.

In the Tegalreja district, near the Cilacap refinery, residents are selling their used cooking oil at local waste banks instead of pouring it down the drain. Each kilogram fetches around US$0.30.

“Used cooking oil is something every household has. Selling it adds to our income. Even if it’s just a little, it helps,” said Bartinah, a resident of KB Gadis village.

“It gives us motivation and hope that one day, the price could rise even higher, maybe up to 10,000 rupiah (US$0.60) per kilogram.”

Indonesia has a potential supply of around 1 million litres of used cooking oil annually, but about 95 per cent of it is exported to Europe and other parts of Asia.

Community collection initiatives could redirect more of that to domestic SAF production.

“In the beginning, we collected around 80kg to 100kg of used cooking oil a month. Now, it’s up to about 170kg,” said Sri Widowati, a coordinator at the Tegalreja Waste Bank.

PRICE SENSITIVITY REMAINS A CHALLENGE

Indonesia plans to introduce a 1 per cent SAF blend in its aviation fuel by 2027, but the high cost of production remains a major obstacle.

SAF can cost two to five times more than conventional jet fuel.

Industry experts say the government needs to step in to ensure that airlines’ use of SAF doesn’t end up driving up ticket prices.

“The Indonesian market for air transport is highly sensitive towards price. It’s so much so that the government has not allowed any price increase for tickets since 2019,” said Alvin Lie, chairman of the Indonesian Association of Air Transport Service Users.

“Now, the fact is that SAF is still expensive, so even a 1 per cent of SAF in the fuel will drive the cost up and inevitably the cost of air tickets will go up.”

Lie suggested that the government look into removing the 12 per cent value-added tax on aviation fuel and air tickets.

""If the government wants to progress with the use of SAF, the least (it) can do is abolish the value-added tax, both for air tickets as well as fuel for domestic routes,"" he said.

Despite these challenges, Indonesia’s ambition to become a regional leader in sustainable aviation fuel is gradually taking shape.

Real progress will depend on how quickly the country can scale up production and secure a steady supply of feedstock – the waste oils and other organic materials that are refined into sustainable fuel.

Indonesia’s transport sector accounts for around 22 per cent of the country’s energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.

For now, SAF remains central to Indonesia’s net-zero emissions goals – and could be its ticket to cleaner, greener skies.","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--gj-7txFB--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2021-08:cna,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2025/11/25/sustainable_aviation_fuel_1.png?itok=QZPT2cfI",N,,2025-11-25 21:56:11.151454

The SAF Grand Challenge, announced in 2021, aims to scale up domestic production of SAF to replace 100% of aviation fuel (about 35 billion gallons) by 2050. The U.S. Department of Energy Roadmap for SAF notes that these 2050 SAF goals cannot be reached without the use of biomass feedstocks, such as corn stover and dedicated energy crops1.

The US has the potential to produce a wide range of high-yielding energy crops, as well as crop residues from corn and wheat2. The per-unit cost of SAF and GHG intensity of SAF (GHG emissions per mega-joule of SAF) will differ with the feedstocks used3,4,5. There is also considerable spatial heterogeneity in yield and soil carbon sequestration rates for each of these feedstocks across the rainfed region of the U.S., which will affect the cost and GHG intensity of SAF with a feedstock across locations. Thus, the supply of SAF at various prices and the GHG savings with SAF relative to petroleum jet will depend on the mix of feedstocks incentivized across locations and the availability of suitable land, which will affect the amount that can be produced. Crop residues provide a lower-cost feedstock for SAF but have relatively low yield and higher GHG intensity than energy crops because they lead to loss of soil carbon instead of soil carbon sequestration like energy crops (see Supplementary Information (SI) Section 2). Energy crops are high-yielding and have high soil carbon sequestration potential, but they are costly to produce, and their production raises concerns about inducing diversion of land from existing uses.

Energy crops have the potential to be produced on “marginal land”6, and Khanna et al.7 show that economically marginal land (defined as land that is idle and would earn close to zero returns from crop production) would have economic incentives to convert to energy crops because its opportunity cost of conversion (or foregone returns from crop production) is low. However, the production of energy crops may not be limited to marginal land because cropland can also have an economic incentive to convert to energy crops if the biomass price is high. Other non-cropland under grass or pasture may similarly have an economic incentive to produce energy crops.

Since different types of land and locations vary in their suitability, yields of energy crops, and costs of producing energy crops, the availability of various types of land for feedstock production will affect the mix of feedstocks and the location of their production. With heterogeneity in yield per unit land across feedstocks and locations, this in turn will affect the land requirement of various aggregate levels of SAF production, the extent of diversion of cropland for energy crops production, and consequences for food/feed crop production and food crop prices.

The mix of feedstocks and the land requirements for their production also have implications for the GHG intensity of SAF. The production of energy crops on cropland and non-cropland will directly affect carbon stocks on that land8. Furthermore, the diversion of cropland to energy crops can raise food crop prices and indirectly induce the conversion of non-cropland to food crop production. Both the direct and indirect causes of land use change, referred to as induced land use change (ILUC), can lead to changes in carbon stocks in the land and affect the overall GHG intensity of SAF.

Existing research has focused on analyzing the breakeven prices, carbon intensity, and land use requirements of individual feedstocks for SAF. Specifically, Fan et al.9 conducted spatially varying techno-economic and life-cycle analysis to compare the spatially varying breakeven price of SAF and GHG intensity of miscanthus, switchgrass, sorghum, and corn stover, across the rainfed US. Gautam et al.10 examine the amount of cropland that could be converted to miscanthus, sorghum, and switchgrass at a given price of soil carbon sequestration and jet fuel; they consider the potential to produce these feedstocks one at a time and do not examine their competition for land or the competition with food crops. Both these studies incorporate the direct soil carbon effects due to feedstock production, but have not analyzed their potential to be grown on non-cropland and the GHG intensity implications of various levels of SAF production. Global partial equilibrium models (GLOBIOM4,11,12) and general equilibrium economic models (such as GTAP-Bio5,13) have analyzed the GHG intensity of specific biofuel feedstock pathways for SAF one at a time. The US Department of Energy’s Billion-ton Report2,14 has examined the supply of biomass from a variety of different cellulosic feedstocks at various biomass prices.

None of these studies has analyzed the economically optimal mix of feedstocks for various levels of aggregate supply of SAF and the implications of varying constraints of availability of land on which they can be produced for this mix of feedstocks. Existing research has also not quantified the aggregate impacts of scaling up SAF production on GHG emissions and land use change, and the extent to which this will vary with land availability constraints.

The goal of this study is to fill these research gaps by undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the economic and GHG implications of biomass-based SAF production in the US. There exist several different pathways and feedstocks for SAF production. These include the Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway for converting oils and fats to SAF and the Fischer–Tropsch (FT) method for converting cellulosic feedstocks to biomass-based SAF. Our analysis focuses on the Alcohol-to-Jet Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (ATJ-SPK) pathway, which has relatively lower breakeven costs than FT and is not constrained by feedstock availability like HEFA15. We examine the economically optimal supply of biomass-based ATJ-SPK, from a wide range of agricultural feedstocks, under alternative scenarios, and quantify the GHG emissions intensity of various levels of supply of ATJ-SAF (defined to include the life-cycle emissions from feedstock production and conversion to SAF and the ILUC-related changes in soil carbon stocks). The life-cycle emissions intensity includes the emissions of producing the feedstock, conversion to ethanol, and upgrading ethanol to ATJ-SPK; no emission credits were applied to cogenerated gasoline- and diesel-range products (as in ref. 9). The ILUC estimates are those within the US and do not consider international land use change.

We undertake this analysis by integrating the DayCent, a biogeochemical model of yield and GHG balance8 with BEPAM, a partial equilibrium, recursive-dynamic, open economy optimization model16,17, and BioSTEAM, a feedstock-specific process engineering model of biorefineries18,19 (see SI Fig. S1 and BEPAM model validation in SI Table S1 and Fig. S2; DayCent model validation in SI Figs. S3–S5). This modeling framework incorporates spatial heterogeneity in yields, costs, soil carbon sequestration rates, and land availability for a wide range of food/feed crops and biomass sources at a Crop Reporting District (CRD). The biomass sources include energy crops (miscanthus, switchgrass, energy sorghum, energy cane, short rotation woody crops (poplar and willow)), as well as crop residues from corn and wheat. The model considers competing demands for cropland and non-cropland for projected food, feed, and feedstock production and determines the welfare-maximizing allocation of land to a wide range of food and energy crops subject to technology, material balance, and land availability constraints. It determines land competition and allocation among alternative uses depending on the net present value of returns to each use. In addition to available cropland, we consider various types of non-cropland that can be converted to crop production, including economically marginal land, as well as grasslands in the US (SI Table S2).

Assessing the availability of economically marginal land is challenging, and Jiang et al.20 use a history of satellite data on land use change to identify 4.3 million hectares of economically marginal land with confidence in the US; of this, 1.7 million hectares is idle and in the rainfed region that is suitable for energy crop production. There is a relatively larger amount of idle land that can be classified as economically marginal with uncertainty in the rainfed region (16.9 million hectares) (details in SI, Section 1; SI Fig. S6). We construct three scenarios of land area that can be potentially converted to crop (food crop and energy crop) production based on Jiang et al.20. These are implemented in BEPAM as land availability constraints, defined at the CRD level (see “Methods” section, SI Fig. S1). In each of these three scenarios, we analyze the incentives for the available land to produce a range of biomass feedstocks under a wide range of biomass prices. These scenarios are motivated by the potential for concerns about ILUC driving policy restrictions on the types of land that can grow energy crops (similar to the restrictions placed by the Renewable Fuel Standard on only using land brought into cultivation before 2007 for producing feedstocks for renewable fuel21). Concerns about expanding cropland and potential for loss of ecosystem services and stored soil carbon stocks may limit energy crops to cropland and “marginal” land with certainty. On the other hand, the desire to ease effects on food crop prices may lead to a willingness to allow conversion of non-cropland (marginal land with uncertainty and grasslands and pastureland) to energy crops. We examine the implications of these land availability scenarios for the supply of SAF at various prices and for food crop prices.

Since there are varying estimates of the carbon stocks that can be released due to land use change, referred to here as emissions factors (EFs)22,23,24,25,26,27, we consider three different model-based estimates of these ILUC-related carbon emissions in computing the overall GHG savings due to SAF production with each land availability and biomass price scenario13,28,29,30. We compare the GHG emissions intensity of SAF with that of the energy-equivalent level of petroleum jet to determine the potential GHG savings with the displacement of petroleum jet. We compare these savings in GHG emissions (difference between the GHG intensity of petroleum jet and SAF) with the foregone opportunities for nature-based carbon sequestration that would have occurred if that land were instead maintained/restored as grasslands31.

Our analysis makes several scientific contributions. By linking an economic model with a biogeochemical and process engineering model, our analysis shows that assuming that energy crops would be produced only on cropland10, or only on marginal land6,32 will lead to underestimation of the economically viable potential to produce SAF from cellulosic feedstocks in the rainfed region of the US. Restricting energy crop production to cropland only, limits the potential of SAF production to 83 B l (24 billion gallons) with a carbon intensity of 23 gCO2e MJ−1. Allowing non-cropland conversion for energy crop production could allow the US to meet the SAF Grand Challenge with cellulosic feedstocks and lower carbon intensity of 15.5 gCO2e MJ−1. This leads to a counter-intuitive finding that the GHG intensity of SAF decreases as more cropland and non-cropland is allowed to be converted to energy crop production, even after we account for land use change emissions. This is due to the high carbon sequestration potential of energy crops, which more than offsets the initial reduction in carbon stocks due to conversion of non-cropland to energy crop production. Our analysis also shows the implications of meeting the SAF Grand Challenge for food crop prices; we find that it would require converting 29 million hectares (12%) of cropland and non-cropland (about half of which would be cropland) to energy crops and raise the food crop price index by 18%. Our analysis highlights the choices we confront, including land use change, crop price increase, and GHG intensity reduction, in promoting SAF for decarbonizing the aviation sector and informs policy choices for SAF production from cellulosic feedstocks.

Economically optimal supply of SAF

The total amount of cellulosic feedstock and SAF that was economically optimal to produce varied as biomass prices increased from $40 Mg−1 to $140 Mg−1 and as the flexibility for non-cropland to convert to crop production increased across the three scenarios of non-cropland availability (Fig. 1A–C and SI Table S3). Biomass production was economically viable at a minimum biomass price of $40 Mg−1, with a maximum of 480 million metric tons (M Mg) of biomass (measured in dry tons with zero moisture) being produced when the price was as high as $140 Mg−1 in scenario (I) (CL + MLC) with cropland and least marginal land availability (CL + MLC). In scenarios (II) and (III) (CL + MLC + U and CL + MLC + U + G) with moderate and high availability of land for bioenergy crop production, total biomass supply increased to 628 M Mg and 900 M Mg (about one billion US tons), respectively, at a price of $140 Mg−1.

The biomass prices analyzed above implied SAF prices ranging from $1.1 l−1 to $1.5 l−1 (in 2016 dollars) to cover the cost of feedstock, transportation cost of feedstock, production cost of cellulosic ethanol (net of co-product electricity credit), and the cost of conversion to ATJ-SPK (SAF). SAF production at these prices ranged from 29 to 171 B l (8–45 B gallons) across the three land availability scenarios (Fig. 1). As the availability of low-cost land for production of energy crops increased, the amount of SAF that could be produced at a given price per liter of SAF increased (see SI Fig. S7). At $1.4 l−1, the amount of SAF production ranged from 83 to 140 B l (22–37 B gallons); the upper end of this range of SAF production could displace 100% of the anticipated petroleum jet consumption in 2050. However, the minimum refinery-gate price of SAF of $1.4 l−1 ($5.3 gallon−1) is several-fold higher than the price of conventional jet fuel of $0.34 l−1 ($1.3 gallon−1) in 2016 dollars, and about twice as high as subsequent prices that rose to $0.8 l−1 ($3 gallon−1) in 2022. The gap in the price of SAF and the price of jet fuel of $0.33-$0.46 l−1 is substantially larger than the SAF tax credit that is currently being offered in the US1.

Economically optimal mix and location of cellulosic feedstock production

The mix of feedstocks produced varied with the price of biomass and the availability of marginal land and grassland. Corn stover and wheat straw were the lowest cost sources of biomass and became viable at biomass prices between $40 and $60 Mg−1. As biomass price increased, it created incentives for increasing the area under continuous corn and no-till (which allows a larger share of residue to be harvested) and reducing the area under corn-soybean rotation and the share of land under conventional tillage.

As biomass price increased and non-cropland availability increased, the share of two high-yielding but more costly feedstocks, miscanthus and energy sorghum, increased across all scenarios (Fig. 1 and SI Table S3). Higher biomass price made it economically viable to convert cropland to these energy crops. The share of other energy crops, such as willow and poplar, was positive but small because of their low yields and suitability for production in limited regions in the US.

The optimal locations for producing miscanthus, switchgrass, energy sorghum, and energy cane varied across the rainfed region of the US (see SI Fig. S8) due to differences in their yields, costs of production, and the opportunity cost of converting land for their production. Miscanthus production was economically viable largely in the Midwest and Atlantic states, while switchgrass was economically viable in the southern states. Energy cane production was confined to the Gulf states, while energy sorghum production was dispersed throughout the region.

Land-use change effects of SAF production

The type and amount of land used for cellulosic feedstock production varied with biomass price and the assumptions about land availability in the different scenarios, as shown in Fig. 2 and SI Table S4. In Scenario (I) (CL + MLC), energy crop production occurred mainly on cropland, followed by cropland that would become surplus in the future (if biomass price had remained at zero) and a small amount of marginal land. The maximum amount of SAF production would be limited to 91 B l (24 B gallons), of which 61 B l (16 B gallons) would be from energy crops and the rest from crop residues and require about 19 M hectares of land that was largely cropland. In scenario (II) (CL + MLC + U) with greater availability of marginal land for energy crops, the same amount of SAF could be produced with less diversion of cropland and greater conversion of marginal land to energy crops. The total amount of SAF that could now be produced is 120 B l (32 B gallons) and would require converting 27 M ha to energy crops, of which about 9 M ha would be marginal land.

In Scenario (III) (CL + MLC + U + G) with the potential for a large amount of grassland to convert to crops, the amount of SAF production can increase to 171 B l (45 B gallons) at a biomass price of $140 Mg−1. The production of 140 B l (37 B gallons) of SAF will require 39 M ha of land dedicated to energy crops, of which about 53% would be from non-cropland (SI Fig. S9 and Table S4). Despite the availability of large amounts of non-cropland in Scenario (III), cropland will be converted to produce energy crops, because much of the non-cropland is in the Great Plains and west of it (as shown in SI Fig. S6), where yields of energy crops are low and land is not rainfed and the cost of biomass production is higher on non-cropland than on cropland.

Production of energy crops will induce some spatial changes in food crop production and grazing land available for cattle. We find that in Scenario (III) with 37 B gallons of SAF production, there will be a loss of 11.7 million hectares of crop acreage in the rainfed region, and a 0.4 million hectare increase in irrigated acreage in states like Texas, Colorado, and California (SI Fig. S10). The conversion of non-cropland to energy crops reduced the availability of grazing land in some states (e.g., Arkansas, Texas, and Kentucky) and increased it in other states, such as Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Montana. Overall, however, there was only a marginal effect on the number of cattle and the quantity of beef production and its price.

Effect of SAF production on food crop prices

As biomass prices increased, more cropland would be diverted from food/feed crop production for energy crops. We find that production of the major crops included in the economic model, such as soybeans, wheat, and sorghum, would decline by more than 15% in the case with a biomass price of $140 Mg−1 relative to the case with a biomass price of zero (SI Fig. S11A). This will also result in a substantial (15–25%) reduction in the exports of these crops (SI Fig. S11B). The reduction in crop production and exports will lead to an increase in crop prices (SI Fig. S12). We computed the Laspeyres Price Index for three major food crops, corn, soybeans, and wheat, at various levels of SAF production in 2030. As SAF production increased beyond 76 B l (20 B gallons), this index increased by 15–30%; the extent of the increase was negatively related to the availability of non-cropland for conversion to crop production. The reduction in crop production and exports and the increase in food crop prices for a given level of SAF production were largest in Scenario (I), in which total active cropland for corn and soybeans was reduced by up to 10% and converted to energy crops. In Scenario (III), with the highest availability of non-cropland, the increase in food crop prices would be smaller because there would be less pressure on the use of land for crop production; an 18% increase in the food crop price index would accompany 37 B gallons of SAF production in Scenario (III) and 20 B gallons of SAF production in Scenario (I). Soybean prices increase more than corn prices because the area under soybeans sees a greater reduction than the area under corn as biomass prices increase. This is because the demand for corn stover creates incentives to switch from corn-soybean rotation to continuous corn, and this reduces the acreage under corn less than that under soybeans. Wheat prices increase the most due to lower opportunity cost of converting wheat acreage to energy crops compared to acreage under corn and soybean in the Midwest and the negligible effects of demand for wheat straw on wheat acreage; however, at the highest SAF price simulated here, there is significant conversion of soybean acreage to energy crops and a higher increase in soybean price compared to wheat.

GHG implications

Our estimates of the GHG intensity of SAF show that it declines as the scale of aggregate biomass and SAF production increases and as land availability increases (Fig. 3). This is because, as SAF production scales up at higher SAF prices, the feedstock mix transitions from being largely crop residues to having a higher share of energy crops. The ILUC emissions, which include a reduction in soil carbon stocks due to conversion of non-cropland to crop production and due to harvesting of crop residues (see SI Fig. S5), as well as the gain in soil carbon stocks due to energy crop production, become increasingly small and even negative in Scenarios (II) and (III) as SAF production increases. ILUC emissions are positive at low biomass prices due to the loss in soil carbon stocks caused by the harvesting of even limited amounts of crop residue. These ILUC become overall negative at higher biomass prices as the share of energy crops in the biomass mix increases; the soil carbon sequestration due to energy crop production is much larger than the carbon emissions generated by the conversion of non-cropland due to their production. We estimated the ILUC emissions with three different EFs and found that the ILUC-related GHG intensity is generally highest with the CCLUB EF and lowest with the DayCent EF. The overall GHG intensity of SAF was estimated to range between 23 and 27 gCO2e MJ−1 when there were 55–89 B l (15–24 B gallons) of SAF with the least marginal land availability. The GHG intensity of SAF would be reduced to 13–25 gCO2e MJ−1 when there were 65–171 B l (17–45 B gallons) of production of SAF with the most generous marginal land availability. The reduction in GHG emissions intensity of SAF ranged from 75% with 24 B gallons of SAF production in Scenario (I) to 83% with 37 B gallons of SAF production in Scenario (III) (SI Fig. S13). Despite differences in ILUC across different EF modeling approaches, the difference in estimates of net GHG intensity with the three EFs was small and within ±6% on average (see Fig. 3). The two alternative ILUC EFs increased the GHG intensity of SAF from the reference range of 13–27 gCO2e MJ−1 to 22–30 gCO2e MJ−1 (see SI Table S5).

A higher level of SAF production and non-cropland availability also led to a greater amount of aggregate GHG savings (due to greater displacement of energy-equivalent jet fuel) relative to the scenario with zero biomass price (Fig. 4). At a given price of SAF, the GHG savings increased as the amount of non-cropland for conversion to energy crops increased. These savings ranged from about 207 M Mg CO2e with 24 B gallons of SAF in Scenario (I) to about 359 M Mg CO2e with 37 B gallons of SAF in Scenario (III); these represented 75% and 83% of emissions from the aviation sector with energy equivalent gallons of petroleum jet fuel consumption (SI Fig. S14 and Table S6). These savings remained substantial even after we considered the uncertainty in various modeling assumptions about crop yields, SAF production costs, and ILUC EFs. The overall potential for reduction in GHG emissions from the aviation sector would range from 163 to 261 M Mg CO2e with 24 B gallons of SAF in Scenario (I) to 295–444 M Mg CO2e with 37 B gallons of SAF in Scenario (III) (Fig. 4).

Although we found that SAF production resulted in GHG savings relative to petroleum jet, the change in soil carbon stock varied over time (SI Fig. S15A). The conversion of land to energy crops generated an initial soil carbon loss derived from soil disturbance during the conversion of non-cropland to cropland (carbon debt). This soil carbon debt was larger at higher biomass and SAF prices, and as land availability increased due to a higher share of energy crops. The carbon debt payback period decreased with larger biomass price and land availability because there was greater production of miscanthus in these scenarios, and miscanthus had a high rate of soil carbon sequestration. We found that the ILUC due to energy crop production led to a soil carbon debt that would take 5–7 years to pay back through additional soil carbon sequestration by energy crops, with the shortest period occurring at the highest level of biomass price and land availability. The corresponding payback periods with CCLUB and AEZ-EF EFs were very close to those with the DayCent model. The 5–7 payback period of soil carbon debt was found to be robust to alternative assumptions of parameters analyzed in the sensitivity analysis.

We compared these savings with the foregone soil carbon sequestration that could have been achieved in the absence of biomass production (that is, with a biomass price of zero). The payback period required to compensate for the foregone soil carbon sequestration by energy crop production alone extended to 7–14 years across all scenarios; it was shortest in Scenario (I) with the lowest amount of forgone soil carbon sequestration and longest in Scenario (III). Corresponding payback periods for CCLUB and AEZ-EF were 5–12 years and 8–15 years, respectively, close to those with the DayCent model. These payback periods were significantly lower than the 90-year repayment period associated with producing corn grain ethanol on land under the Conservation Reserve Program33. Our findings are consistent with the results from a prior study that a 0–5 year payback period was achievable with biofuels supplied by miscanthus grown on grasslands at a global scale34.

However, this payback period would be reduced to less than 1 year when potential fossil fuel displacement benefits were considered, and was similar to all three LUC EFs (see SI Fig. S15B). After including the GHG savings due to the displacement of fossil fuels, we found that the GHG savings with SAF production were 20-fold larger than the savings obtained by restoring abandoned cropland and marginal land to grassland as in Scenario (I), and 8-fold larger than the level obtained by preserving the converted grasslands in Scenario (III).

Meeting the SAF Grand Challenge will require substantially expanding SAF production from 16 million gallons currently to more than 35 B gallons in the coming decades. With substantial shares of corn and soybeans already being used for biofuel, expansion of SAF production is expected to require going beyond food crops to cellulosic feedstocks. There are many choices of cellulosic feedstocks, including crop residues, perennial energy crops, and short rotation woody crops, and considerable spatial heterogeneity in their yields, costs of production, and GHG intensity across the rainfed region. There is also a policy choice of the types of land, cropland, marginal land, and grasslands, which should be allowed to produce energy crops to meet the demand for SAF. Our analysis shows the trade-offs that scaling up of SAF production will pose for land use change, GHG intensity, and food crop prices. We find that as the amount of non-cropland available to produce SAF feedstocks was allowed to increase, the amount of cropland converted to energy crops decreased, and the impact on food crop prices decreased. Moreover, the GHG intensity of SAF also decreased because it would become economically viable to produce more energy crops, which would lead to an increase in soil carbon sequestration that was greater than the loss in soil carbon stocks due to land use change.

More specifically, 24–37 B gallons of SAF production would require converting about 8–12% of available cropland, marginal land, and non-cropland in the model to energy crops. The increase in SAF production would reduce food/feed crop production and exports and increase crop prices; the extent to which this is the case varies across crops. The impact on some crops, such as soybeans and wheat, for which the US is a large producer and exporter in the world market, could pose risks to food security within the US and internationally.

The effects of a given level of SAF production on food crop prices were negatively related to the availability of non-cropland; 24 B gallon of SAF production would be accompanied by 30% increase in crop price index if feedstock production is restricted to cropland and to 15% increase in crop price index if marginal land and grassland can be utilized for feedstock production and a 37 B gallon SAF production would be accompanied by a 18% increase in the food crop price index. Additionally, allowing 24 B gallons of SAF feedstock production to expand on grasslands would result in a lower GHG intensity of 20.6 gCO2e MJ−1 compared to 22.7 gCO2e MJ−1 with restricting it to cropland and marginal land with confidence only.

The production of SAF from crop residues alone would reduce GHG emissions intensity by 50% relative to the level with a biomass price of zero. With higher levels of land conversion to energy crop production, the GHG emissions intensity reduction with SAF production of 24–37 B gallons ranged from 75% to 83% relative to petroleum jet. We also find that conversion of marginal and grasslands to energy crops that displace fossil fuels can lead to greater GHG savings than can be achieved by restoring and maintaining land as grasslands.

A key challenge to scaling up biomass-based SAF is its high cost relative to the price of petroleum jet. The SAF tax credit per unit of SAF currently being offered is insufficient to cover this price gap. Our analysis can be used to determine the tax credit (gap between the price of SAF and the price of petroleum jet per unit) that will be needed to incentivize various levels of biomass-based SAF production. It shows that the tax credit needed to induce a given volume of SAF will be lower as the land availability constraint is eased to include more marginal and non-cropland. Additionally, our analysis shows that given the numerous choices for feedstocks that differ in their carbon intensity, a tax credit per unit SAF that increases as the carbon intensity of SAF decreases will be more effective in inducing low-carbon SAF than a volumetric tax credit. The latter will incentivize the lowest cost feedstocks and not the feedstocks that have the lowest carbon intensity but relatively high cost of production.

There are several technical and infrastructural challenges to scaling up energy crop production, particularly on non-cropland, that were not considered in this analysis. Scaling up energy crop production will require planting material that could take several years to build. It may also require diverting non-cropland from other services such as hunting, open space, or wilderness, and this may make landowners reluctant to convert it to energy crops (Skevas et al.35); this could increase the opportunity cost of producing energy crops on this land and the biomass price needed to induce their production. Additionally, significant investment may be needed to create the roads and other infrastructure that will enable industrial-scale production of energy crops on land that had been abandoned from agriculture. The focus of this study is on analyzing the supply side of SAF production at the refinery gate and its land use change implications. We do not consider the transportation of SAF from biorefineries to the airports. Our analysis informs optimal location choices for feedstock production but leaves the biorefinery sitting to future research.

Our analysis also assumed that landowners would choose the crop with the highest discounted value of returns over a time period. Risk-averse farmers will also consider the riskiness of income streams with conventional crops and energy crops. High upfront costs of establishment, time lags between planting and harvesting of perennial energy crops, and the need for long-term commitments to earn returns over the lifespan of the crop can raise the biomass price at which farmers would be willing to grow these crops36.

The biomass production and GHG savings obtained here at various biomass prices and land availability scenarios should, therefore, be an upper bound. Our analysis focused on the technical potential to displace petroleum jet and mitigate GHG emissions. The extent to which biomass-based SAF will displace jet fuel in the market will depend on market conditions and may be limited by changes in oil prices due to large-scale SAF production, which may lead to a rebound effect in domestic and global fuel markets.

The supply of SAF under various land availability constraints simulated here is determined under implicit assumptions about macroeconomic factors, such as growth in population, growth in Gross Domestic Product, and so on. These factors can affect demand for food crops and derived products over time, and the competition for cropland with SAF feedstocks. The framework developed here can be extended by specifying alternative scenarios of demand for food crops and derived products, induced by macro-economic drivers, and simulating their effects on the availability of cropland for SAF feedstock production and its implications for the supply of SAF.

While scale-up of SAF is essential for decarbonizing the aviation sector, its deployment should be carefully managed to avoid worsening energy security in a climate-disrupted world. A diversified portfolio of feedstock sources for SAF and a mix of alternative fuels in the aviation sector may be needed to increase resilience to extreme events and climate change.

Lastly, we do not consider the potential to produce forest biomass for bioenergy or the implications of biomass markets for the conversion of land between crops and forest. We refer readers to Valin et al.37 and the Billion Ton Study14, which find a small share of biomass (for bioenergy) that would be produced from forests in the EU and US, respectively; the latter also notes that much of the land use change from forest land is expected to be towards urban land rather than cropland. We leave further investigation of these issues for future research.

Alternative scenarios

We obtained biomass supply curves, over a wide range of biomass prices, and their GHG outcomes under three scenarios that differed in their definition of land assumed to be available for conversion to crop production (see SI Fig. S1). Specifically we considered three land availability scenarios: Scenario (I) assumed that cropland (CL) and economically marginal land with confidence (CL + MLC) can convert to crop production; Scenario (II) assumed that cropland and economically marginal land with confidence and with uncertainty (CL + MLC + U) can convert to crop production; Scenario (III) assumed that cropland, as well as marginal land with confidence and uncertainty and permanent grassland (CL + MLC + U + G) can convert to cropland (see SI Fig. S6 and Table S2 for detailed description of land types).

With each of the land availability scenarios, we simulated the economic incentives, with biomass prices ranging from zero to $140 Mg−1, to produce a variety of energy crops and crop residues. We determined the type of land that will be converted to energy crops and their implications for land use change. In addition, in each of these scenarios, we also accounted for cropland that will become idle (surplus) over the 2016–2030 period in the absence of any biomass production (with a biomass price of zero) as growth in crop productivity outpaces demand for agricultural commodities. We allowed it to convert to energy crop production in scenarios with a positive price of biomass.

With each of the three land availability scenarios and biomass prices, we considered three alternative estimates of EFs. These are obtained from (i) DayCent Model simulations (DayCent-EF)8 (ii) Carbon Calculator for Land Use and Land Management Change from Biofuels Production (CCLUB-EF) based on CENTURY model38, and (iii) Agro-ecological zone emission factor model (AEZ-EF)26,27,29 (for more details see SI Section 5). The limitations and strengths of these models have been discussed in the existing literature22,26,27,39.

Modeling the economic incentives for land allocation

The version of BEPAM (Biofuel and Environmental Policy Analysis Model) applied here models the agricultural sector and determines economically optimal land-use and feedstock mix at the US scale by maximizing the sum of agricultural sector consumers’ and producers’ surplus subject to various resource balances, land availability, and technological constraints under a range of biomass prices, from zero to $140 Mg−1 over the 2016–2030 period. The model endogenously determines optimal land use allocation for thirteen row crops and six energy crops on both cropland and non-cropland endogenously based on the biomass prices, availability of land, and the net returns to crop production. The model includes several sources of biomass, including herbaceous energy crops (miscanthus, switchgrass, energy sorghum, energy cane), short rotation woody crops (poplar and willow), and crop residues (corn stover and wheat straw). It also includes livestock production and various processed commodity markets. In the crop and livestock markets, primary crop and livestock commodities are consumed either domestically or traded with the rest of the world. Domestic and export demand for each of the agricultural commodities is exogenously given. The model simulates food/feed crop, livestock, and biomass production, consumption, and prices that ensure market demand and supply are in equilibrium at various biomass prices.

The model was applied to simulate the land-use decisions for 304 CRDs by incorporating the spatially heterogeneous yields of different crops obtained from DayCent and returns to producing them, and land availability constraints. The DayCent model was applied to simulate yields and soil carbon sequestration with row crops (corn and soybeans), corn stover, and energy crops on cropland and on marginal land. This integrated modeling framework endogenously determined annual future returns and costs of production of each type of crop on each type of land (e.g., cropland, marginal land) at the CRD level. The costs of inputs and field operations were calculated at the CRD level for each crop and land type. The opportunity cost of land for producing energy crops was endogenously determined by the shadow price of the land constraint in the model.

Land allocation in BEPAM is determined by assuming that landowners use a 10-year rolling horizon to make decisions. Land is converted to alternative uses depending on the net present value of returns to alternative uses over the rolling horizon, including the cost of land conversion. The model is run for 10 years at a time and uses the first year’s solution to update market conditions and then runs the model again for the next 10 years, and so on, with a rolling horizon. Specifically, the model first solves for the 2016–2025 period; we then take the first-year solution values, such as land allocation among different uses and crop prices as ‘realized’, move the horizon one year forward, and solve the new problem, and iterate until the problem is solved for year 2030 (the last simulation for the period 2030–2039).

Since our focus is on analyzing the incremental land use effects of cellulosic feedstock production at various biomass prices, we keep all other demands on land the same as in the zero biomass case. We assumed that production of first-generation biofuels is maintained at their level in 2016 across scenarios and over the simulation period. For simplicity, annual corn-based ethanol production is assumed to be at the maximum permitted level of 15 billion gallons, and the model does not consider exports of corn ethanol. Demands for other first-generation biofuels are exogenously fixed at 2016 levels following the EIA Outlook.

We used three-year (2014–2016) average prices, consumption, exports, and imports of crop and livestock commodities to calibrate the domestic demand, export demand, and import supply functions for all commodities. Domestic demands, export demands, and import supply curves were assumed to grow over time at exogenously specified rates based on the FAPRI 2010 U.S. and World Agricultural Outlook. In our model, we assumed the average annual shift rates presented in this outlook applied to the entire simulated period. More details of the BEPAM and DayCent model and their validation can be found in the SI (Sections 2 and 3; SI Figs. S2–S5 and Table S1).

BEPAM has several features that make it appropriate for the analysis in this paper. First, it has a high level of spatial heterogeneity, which enables a more detailed representation of agricultural activities at the CRD-level (for 304 CRDs in the US). This enables us to incorporate spatial heterogeneity in yields, carbon sequestration and costs of production of various cellulosic feedstocks at a finer scale relative to existing integrated models which are at an agro-ecological zone, sub-national or US water basin level (e.g., GTAP and GCAM-USA)29,40,41 and to endogenously determine the mix of various energy crops that will be produced at various biomass prices and land availability scenarios. As our analysis shows, there is a significant difference in yields across feedstocks and the optimal location of feedstocks. Second, BEPAM enables us to develop an integrated framework with DayCent and BioSTEAM to include the spatially explicit yields and soil carbon sequestration with various feedstocks and to incorporate the techno-economic and life-cycle analysis for various biomass feedstocks and conversion processes at a feedstock-specific level. Third, it is a multi-period, recursive dynamic model, which makes it well-suited for studying perennial energy crops and updating the agricultural market conditions farmers face dynamically. The rolling horizon setting is more consistent with farmers’ planning process than the traditional forward-looking models, which involve a single run of the model for the entire simulation period.

Availability of non-cropland

We identified economically marginal land as land that is intermittently switching between crop and non-crop (see ref. 20). Estimates of economically marginal land availability in our modeling framework were derived from the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) provided by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) using methods described in Jiang et al.20 (see SI Section 1). We distinguished between land that can be classified as marginal with statistical confidence and marginal with uncertainty, as well as land that can be classified as permanent grassland and permanent cropland based on the analysis by Jiang et al.20. They found that the amount of land that could be classified as economically marginal with certainty in the rainfed region was small (1.7 million hectares) and that there was a substantial amount of land in the rainfed region that could only be classified as economically marginal with uncertainty (16.9 million hectares) in 2016. They also identified permanent grassland, which had been permanently in grass over the 2008–2015 period. Since we are unable to distinguish between grassland and pastureland from CDL data, both categories are included in the category defined as grassland. The availability and spatial distribution of non-cropland under each scenario are shown in SI Fig. S6.

GHG emissions assessment

The GHG emission effects of SAF accounted for in this study included the following two components: (1) life-cycle GHG emissions (that occur aboveground and are also referred to as supply chain emissions) and include all emissions due to the harvesting of crop residues for biomass (including harvesting and replacement fertilizer application), planting of energy cops to their harvest (emissions from fertilizer, chemicals, fuels and machinery), transport to the refinery and conversion to SAF in the refinery. The process of conversion of biomass to (ATJ-SPK) SAF leads to the co-generation of electricity that displaces grid electricity and creates a co-product carbon credit that is subtracted from these life-cycle emissions, (2) induced land-use change related changes in soil-carbon stocks caused directly by the production of energy crops and removal of crop residues for biomass, including soil organic carbon, nitrous oxide and methane fluxes and changes in vegetation when energy crops are planted on non-cropland, as well as changes in soil carbon stocks caused indirectly by the change in crop and land prices induced by the conversion of cropland to energy crop production (see SI Section 2).

We assessed GHG savings from the aviation sector by comparing the sum of the life-cycle and ILUC emissions with SAF production with corresponding emissions from petroleum jet, assuming displacement on an energy-equivalent basis. We quantified the GHG emissions in 2030 from sources described above. We compared these emissions with the emissions from petroleum jet fuel on an energy-equivalent basis. This represents the technical GHG mitigation potential of cellulosic feedstocks since it does not consider any feedback effects on aviation fuel markets of large-scale displacement of jet fuel. The GHG emissions from converting cellulosic feedstocks to cellulosic ethanol in gCO2e MJ−1 were measured based on the conversion coefficients of producing cellulosic ethanol from different feedstocks and carbon emission intensity as simulated by BioSTEAM. We assumed that cellulosic ethanol was converted to SAF via the ATJ-SPK pathway, and no emission credits were included for cogenerated gasoline- and diesel products. The emissions of upgrading ethanol to SAF were calculated based on the emission factor of producing jet from ethanol (21 gCO2e MJ−1 jet) reported by the GREET model. Emissions of converting ethanol to SAF were assumed to remain the same for all feedstock-based cellulosic ethanol.

We then compared the GHG savings with SAF obtained above to the foregone carbon sequestration on land that is converted to energy crop production instead of remaining or being restored to grasslands. We assessed this by including soil carbon sequestration that would have been obtained by (1) preserving grassland as unharvested; (2) restoring surplus cropland to grassland, and (3) restoring marginal land to grassland (instead of converting these lands to energy crops). Details of the methods for the computation of GHG savings and forgone carbon sequestration are presented in the SI Section 5. The average rates of annual soil carbon sequestration per hectare with various feedstocks are shown in SI Fig. S5.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-02913-x/MediaObjects/43247_2025_2913_Figa_HTML.png,N,,2025-11-25 21:56:15.880491

Olivia Palamountain reports

Magnifica Air has revealed plans for a new kind of airline that sits between private aviation and first-class commercial travel, offering what it describes as the privacy of a jet with the operational scope of a major carrier.

When it launches in 2027, the Florida-based startup will introduce a fleet of Airbus A220-300 and A321neo aircraft, each configured for between 45 and 54 passengers. The aim is to create a quieter, more personal flying experience at what the company claims will be a fraction of the cost of chartering a private jet.

According to The Independent, the airline believes it has identified “a gap in the market” for wealthy travellers who want a calmer, more human experience without paying private jet prices.

Boutique design

The concept blends low-density cabins with the scale and consistency of scheduled operations. Aircraft interiors will feature private suites, hand-crafted business-class seating and open spaces created by removing overhead bins. Renderings shared by the airline show two-by-two seating in warm brown tones, residential-style sofa suites and an onboard bar, highlighting its ambition to make the cabin feel more like a boutique hotel than an aircraft. Lighting will adapt throughout the flight, menus will be designed with chefs and sommeliers, and service will follow the rhythm of a private members’ club.

Seamless connections

Magnifica Air’s guest journey begins long before boarding. Travellers will arrive at private terminals only 30 minutes before departure, where baggage will be handled by concierge staff and security screening will take place within the lounge. Aided by facial recognition technology, the process is designed to be quick and unobtrusive. From there, guests will be escorted directly to the aircraft by sprinter van or private ramp walk. On arrival, baggage will be returned within minutes, chauffeurs will meet passengers at the kerb, and onward lounges will be available for those continuing their journey.

Clean tech

The company places sustainability at the centre of its design. Magnifica Air will launch as carbon neutral, supported by more than seven million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel integrated into its East Coast operations each year. Lounges will run on solar power and the airline is exploring hybrid-electric aircraft as part of future planning. On board, aircraft will introduce the world’s first commercial-scale surface purification system using Aviation Clean Air technology, paired with a humidification system to reduce the drying effects of long-haul travel.

Experience trips

The route network will begin with six to seven daily flights, connecting Miami, New York, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, Dallas and Houston, with seasonal services to Napa Valley and the Caribbean. Magnifica Air has already signed agreements for six Airbus A220s and two A321neos, with the first scheduled for delivery in early 2027 before refurbishment and entry to service later that year. Alongside scheduled flights, curated “experience trips” will be offered to cultural and sporting events, including Art Basel and Formula 1.

Affordable luxury

Supporting the launch is a leadership team drawn from both private and commercial aviation, led by chief executive Wade Black. He describes the airline as a response to a fragmented premium market where customers must choose between crowded first-class cabins or costly private jet charters. As he explains: “This is the space in between.” The Independent reports that the company’s blog positions the airline as “a fully private, seamless experience for a fraction of what you’d pay to charter a jet.”

Member perks

Magnifica Air has also introduced The Seven Club, a membership platform that blends air travel with art, wellness and cultural access. Members will receive priority booking, concierge support and invitations to curated events, from artist previews at Art Basel to tailored programmes at major sporting fixtures. Family and corporate memberships will be available through a tiered structure, with prices starting from US$14,950.

Black describes the programme as an opportunity to bring “joy and excitement back to the sky,” positioning the club as an emotional extension of the airline rather than a list of perks.",https://globetrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MAGAIR-INTERIOR-FINAL-3.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 21:56:23.189595

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt.

Now, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have discovered a novel way to address that problem—by converting food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets industry standards without relying on fossil fuel blends. Their process, described in a new Nature Communications study, could help the aviation industry meet its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The process in a nutshell is this: The researchers convert food waste into biocrude oil through a thermochemical conversion process called hydrothermal liquefaction, or HTL. Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil, and finally, they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel.

This approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE), part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at U. of I.

In this project, the researchers used waste from a nearby food processing facility. Globally, over 30% of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain — from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and recycling waste helps promote sustainability.

But HTL can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including food, sewage sludge, algal bloom, swine manure, and agricultural residue.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used a process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur—leaving behind only the hydrocarbons needed for fuel. After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.

To optimize the hydrotreatment process, the researchers adjusted variables such as temperature, catalyst and hydrogen loads, and retention time to identify the best conditions for producing jet fuel. They then tested their sustainable aviation fuel against rigorous standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration. Their SAF sample passed Tier Alpha and Beta prescreening tests and met all specifications for conventional jet fuel—without requiring any additives or blending with fossil fuels.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Uof_I_Nov25_0d6c61fd79.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 17:56:46.348756

After harvest, farmland often sits fallow and unused until growers seed in the next crop. Soil can erode, weeds can take root, and farmers don’t make any money during that time. Cover crops can eliminate or reduce some of those issues, but many farmers have concerns about their effects on soil quality, a reduced growing window for their primary crop, and the inability to sell the cover crop.

In a paper recently published in the journal Biomass and Bioenergy, a team led by Washington State University scientists looked at four cover crops grown for multiple years in western and central Washington fields. Two showed promising results.

Triticale, a hybrid of wheat and rye, produced the highest yields, and hairy vetch, a vine-like legume with hairy leaves, provided stable yields at low costs while adding nitrogen to the soil.

“The idea is to unlock new cover crop supplies,” said Miki Santosa, a graduate student in WSU’s Department of Biological Systems Engineering and corresponding author on the paper. “We don’t want to harm the economics for farmers or hurt the soil, so we looked closely at pain points farmers experience when cover crops are used.”

The project is a joint venture between WSU and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where Santosa is also a chemical engineer.

The team also looked at biofuel potential for each cover crop. That was aided by a new technique called hydrothermal liquefaction, during which the harvested crops, called biomass, are processed into fuel.

“The ultimate goal is to provide refineries and processors with more biomass and renewable feedstocks,” said Santosa, who plans to graduate with a PhD in 2026. “Working with farmers and the agriculture industry to find suitable crops is vital to reaching that goal.”

Currently, any crop used for biofuel has its own specialized process for how biomass is converted into fuel. That makes it difficult to establish a market when, for example, corn undergoes an entirely different process than soybeans. Hydrothermal liquefaction allows processors to mix different types of biomass to produce biofuel.

The study showed that each crop included in the field trials can be processed into biofuels through the liquefaction process.

“If processors can homogenize different materials to make fuel, that lets us think about growing a variety of crops that work well in different areas,” said Chad Kruger, director of WSU’s Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources and a co-author on the paper.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/WSU_Cover_Crop_Nov25_b59a7ae07e.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 16:57:06.836555

McKinsey & Company, a leading global management consultancy, is not only advising clients on how to navigate the complexities of sustainability and climate challenges but is also actively enhancing its own environmental commitments.

By setting stringent, science-aligned targets to reach a net zero future, McKinsey aims to cut emissions, scale climate solutions and drive broader climate initiatives globally.

Incorporating science-based targets

McKinsey has taken robust steps to align its climate strategy with science-based targets, aiming to meet the global climate goals outlined in the Paris Agreement.

The company has set ambitious milestones, the near-term target for 2025, mid-term goals for 2030 and a long-term vision for 2050, focusing on cutting GHG emissions across its global operations.

The commitment is evidenced by the firm’s plans to drastically reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions, with projections to reach a 90% cut by 2050.

“Our 2030 emissions reduction targets have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative, the industry’s most rigorous scientific standard,” writes Alizé Perrot, Environmental Sustainability Specialist at McKinsey, on LinkedIn.

“These targets set a clear path for our rapid, science-aligned progress, which is driven by a three part strategy – cutting emissions, compensating for remaining emissions and catalysing climate action beyond our firm.”

Alongside this effort, McKinsey has achieved early success by surpassing some of its 2025 targets ahead of schedule, showcasing the effectiveness of strategic initiatives like electrifying company vehicles and transitioning to renewable energy sources.

McKinsey has been named 47th in Sustainability Magazine’s Top 250 World’s Most Sustainable Companies 2025.

Addressing Scope 3 emissions

Scope 3 emissions form a significant portion of McKinsey’s carbon footprint, primarily due to business travel.

To tackle this, McKinsey has implemented a series of strategies to alter travel behaviours and influence market conditions, such as introducing a carbon fee on travel and engaging in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) procurement.

Where emissions cannot be entirely eliminated, McKinsey supports certified carbon removal projects.

The firm is committed to shifting its offset strategy to 100% carbon removals by 2030, leveraging both nature-based and technology-driven solutions to address emissions that are more complex to mitigate.

Climate solutions through collaboration

Beyond internal measures, McKinsey uses its influence to foster wider climate action by engaging in collaborative initiatives.

For example, McKinsey plays a pivotal role in projects like the Frontier initiative, providing financial backing for carbon removal technologies, and the LEAF Coalition, which aims to protect forests through large-scale financing.

Similarly, McKinsey has co-founded the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) to promote the scaling of SAF.

These strategic collaborations not only underline McKinsey’s commitment to reducing its footprint but also underscores its role as a significant private-sector catalyst for decarbonisation.

“I’m proud of the team for the hard and continuous work to decarbonise our own operations,” wrote Isabelle Schuhmann, Global Director of Environmental Sustainability at McKinsey, on LinkedIn.

“From fleet electrification, green building certifications, train travel, green hotels and electric taxis to signing long-term offtake agreements for sustainable aviation fuel to help decarbonise our air travel emissions.”

The path forward

The path to a sustainable and climate-conscious future demands coordination among stakeholders across sectors.

McKinsey is aware of this and is investing in sustainability-oriented services to aid clients in their decarbonisation journeys.

The firm's strategy involves supporting clients in understanding and implementing sustainability initiatives and tackling the transition to net zero.

This includes establishing the McKinsey Sustainability platform to equip organisations with the tools and knowledge needed to navigate the complex landscape of ESG challenges effectively.

The potential scale-up of sustainable aviation fuels production capacity to meet global and EU policy targets.","As the world grapples with the urgent necessity to combat climate change, the aviation sector emerges as one of the most challenging industries to decarbonize. Air travel, responsible for a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions, demands innovative solutions that can reconcile the soaring demand for mobility with the imperative to reduce carbon footprints. In this context, sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) have garnered increasing attention as a critical lever to transform the future of flight. A groundbreaking study recently published in Nature Communications by Martulli, Brandt, Allroggen, and colleagues explores the unprecedented potential to massively scale up SAF production capacity to align with both global and European Union climate targets.

The research taps into technological advances, policy frameworks, and economic modeling to investigate pathways through which the production of SAFs could feasibly meet stringent emissions reduction goals laid out for the coming decades. Unlike traditional jet fuels derived from fossil crude, SAFs are produced from renewable sources such as biomass, waste oils, and even synthetic pathways. These fuels offer the promise of dramatically reduced lifecycle carbon emissions—up to 80% less than conventional jet fuel—without necessitating major modifications to existing aircraft engines or infrastructure. However, scaling this industry remains an enormous challenge that intertwines supply chains, feedstock availability, technical hurdles, and regulatory complexities.

Core to the team’s analysis is a techno-economic assessment that incorporates current and projected capacities across various SAF production technologies. The study dissects the landscape into key segments: hydrotreating of vegetable oils and animal fats, pyrolysis and gasification of lignocellulosic biomass, power-to-liquid synthetic fuels utilizing green hydrogen, and emerging bioengineered pathways. By systematically evaluating resource constraints alongside production costs and energy balances, the researchers demonstrate that aggressive investments and policy support could elevate global SAF output to cover up to 50% of jet fuel demand by 2050.

One of the pivotal findings of the paper is the identification of biorefinery hubs optimized for regional feedstock availability, particularly in Europe. The EU’s policy environment, including the Renewable Energy Directive and the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, validates an optimistic scenario where sustainable aviation fuels are deeply embedded in the continent’s energy mix. The study emphasizes that regional cooperation and supply chain integration are instrumental in overcoming feedstock fragmentation—a significant bottleneck for large-scale SAF production. Furthermore, coupling SAF facilities with existing biofuel and chemical plants could create synergies that sharply reduce capital expenditures and operational risks.

Significantly, the research surfaces the critical role of advanced synthetic fuels, created via power-to-liquid routes that convert renewable electricity and captured carbon dioxide into drop-in jet fuels. These fuels, though currently expensive and in early stages of commercialization, have the theoretical advantage of unlimited feedstock potential since they use atmospheric CO2 and green hydrogen derived from wind and solar power. By integrating synthetic SAFs into the broader fuel portfolio, the aviation sector could further decouple itself from biomass limitations and volatile feedstock markets.

The authors also stress the urgency of overcoming economic barriers to widespread SAF adoption. Although operating SAF plants at a massive scale can achieve economies of scale, the initial capital outlays and infrastructure development require robust policy incentives. Carbon pricing mechanisms, blending mandates, and investment subsidies are highlighted as crucial measures to make SAF competitive against conventional jet fuels, which historically benefit from well-established, subsidized fossil fuel supply chains. The forthcoming EU Green Deal and the global alignment under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals provide an enabling backdrop for these policy interventions.

From a lifecycle emissions perspective, the study provides a granular comparison of different production pathways, considering factors such as land use change, water consumption, and indirect emissions. This comprehensive approach is vital for ensuring that SAFs deliver the intended environmental benefits without unintended negative side effects. For example, fuels derived from feedstocks linked to deforestation or intensive agriculture can undermine the sustainability claims of SAFs. Hence, the research underscores stringent sustainability certification schemes as indispensable to maintaining environmental integrity.

An important dimension the study explores is the synergy between SAF production and circular economy principles. Utilizing waste residues from agriculture, forestry, and municipal sources not only offers abundant feedstocks without competing with food production but also mitigates waste disposal issues. Furthermore, by valorizing carbon-rich waste streams, SAF production can function as a carbon sink, contributing to negative emissions in integrated systems. This holistic view aligns with emerging broader climate strategies that encompass carbon management, resource efficiency, and resilient energy systems.

On the technological front, the paper spotlights innovation trends that could tilt the balance in favor of SAFs. Advances in catalytic processes, microorganism engineering, and process intensification hold the promise of improving yield efficiencies, reducing energy inputs, and driving down costs. The integration of digital tools, such as AI-driven process optimization and supply chain analytics, are anticipated to accelerate the maturity of SAF technologies. Furthermore, the research calls for intensified collaboration between academia, industry, and policymakers to fast-track R&D efforts focused on scalable, low-carbon aviation solutions.

A notable policy insight from the study is the balancing act between short-term implementations and long-term strategic visions. While drop-in fuels derived from conventional biomass feedstocks can kickstart SAF deployment today, they may be insufficient for meeting net-zero targets in the mid-century horizon. Therefore, a progressive trajectory that increasingly incorporates synthetic fuels and carbon capture technologies is advocated. This phased approach allows for leveraging existing industrial capacity while incrementally integrating novel technologies as they mature and become commercially viable.

The research also highlights the geopolitical implications surrounding SAF feedstock supply chains. Dependence on certain biomass resources can be geopolitically sensitive, potentially leading to supply insecurities or price volatility. Diversification strategies, including domestic feedstock production and international collaboration frameworks, emerge as critical considerations for building resilient SAF supply chains. European countries, in particular, may need to balance imports with boosting local biomass cultivation and waste utilization to secure sustainable supply while fostering rural economies.

Importantly, the study contextualizes SAFs within broader aviation decarbonization strategies. While SAFs promise significant carbon reductions, they alone cannot achieve the sector’s ambitious climate commitments. Complementary measures, such as aircraft efficiency improvements, operational optimizations, demand management, and the development of electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft for short-haul flights, must proceed in tandem. SAFs thus act as a vital bridge technology facilitating near-to medium-term emissions reductions while the next-generation aircraft technologies advance.

The authors conclude with a compelling narrative of opportunity and responsibility. Mobilizing the capital, political will, and technological creativity required to scale SAF production at a global level is daunting, but feasible. With coordinated action and transparent frameworks, the aviation industry can fundamentally transform its emissions trajectory, securing sustainable skies for future generations. This transformative potential resonates not only for climate mitigation but also for economic innovation, energy security, and environmental justice.

Each pathway has its own feedstocks, conversion processes and advantages, but together they highlight the opportunities and challenges of scaling SAF for global aviation.","Decarbonizing flight will not happen overnight, but the journey for innovative pathways to create sustainable jet fuel has already taken off. The aviation sector is responsible for about 2.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and in the U.S., approximately 98% of aviation-related emissions result from jet fuel combustion.1,2 This highlights the critical role of fuel decarbonization strategies, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) being considered among the more feasible options available for reducing emissions from medium- to long-haul flights.3 Governments in the European Union (EU) and UK are pushing this transformation forward by setting mandates for the progressive use of aviation fuel originating from sustainable materials.4 For example, as of January 1, 2025, commercial flights taking off from EU airports must carry at least 2% of SAF in their tanks. By 2030, the mandate requires a minimum of 6% of SAF, including a 1.2% synthetic aviation fuel (eSAF) blend with conventional jet fuel.5 In addition, many airline members of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) have committed to a 10% reduction by 2030, aiming for net zero by 2050.6

The state of SAF. There are two primary categories of SAF: bio-SAF, derived from biomass and eSAF (also known as synthetic or power-to-liquid SAF), produced by combining green hydrogen (H₂) from water electrolysis with captured carbon dioxide (CO₂). These intermediates can be converted into hydrocarbons through several pathways, including Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, methanol-to-jet (MtJ) and alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) processes. Each route upgrades intermediates into jet-range hydrocarbons through a series of catalytic steps, which may include oligomerization, hydrogenation and hydroprocessing to meet jet fuel specifications.7,8 When produced from waste-based feedstocks, SAF can reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80%–90% compared to conventional jet fuel, depending on the production pathway.9

Today, SAF deployment faces investment barriers. Cost estimates indicate that SAF is 2─10 times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, depending on the feedstock and conversion technology used, largely due to high capital expenditure (CAPEX) for early-stage facilities, limited economies of scale and the expense of green H2 for eSAF pathways.10,11 While SAF is technically mature and scalable, achieving cost competitiveness will require coordinated investment, supportive policy and continued innovation across the value chain.12

Moreover, feedstock availability is limited. The Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) projects global SAF demand could reach 330 MM metric t (MMt)–450 MMt by 2050; however, production is only a fraction of this target.13 For example, Neste (an SAF producer) produces approximately 1.5 MMtpy,14 while Spanish energy company Moeve delivered 14,400 metric t of SAF in 2024 and aims to scale to 800,000 metric tpy by 2030 through a second-generation biofuels plant in Huelva, Spain.15 These figures underscore the scale-up challenge and the need for coordinated policy, investment and technology development to close the gap between capacity and future demand.

While there is a massive SAF market on the rise, the limited availability of waste-based feedstock makes it difficult to meet alternative fuel mandates with bio-based SAF alone. This opens the need for eSAF, made with green H2 and captured biogenic CO2, which is a byproduct of many industrial processes.

In line with the long-term global aspirational goal for international aviation of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and building on the ICAO-adopted Global Framework for SAF and other cleaner energy sources, this statement reinforces the shared European and African commitment to supporting the development, production and deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuels.

The European Union adopted the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation in October 2023 and the African Union adopted a Continental Strategy for SAF in February 2025. The European Union Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), which launched in November 2025, underscores the importance of an EU-Africa co-operation on SAF. Sustainable Aviation Fuels will be the main contributor to aviation decarbonisation, and its development will be a powerful economic catalyst driving the creation of new jobs and economic growth for developing states.

Current production levels of these fuels are still low and there is an urgent need for global action to accelerate the scale up in development, production and deployment of SAF and other cleaner energies, which are produced in a small number of states. Support for SAF and other cleaner energy projects in Africa could play a pivotal role in decentralization of such fuel production across the various regions in Africa, providing an opportunity to participate across the value chain, from feedstock to fuel production and use, therefore achieving common EU and AU objectives in the most efficient way.

In this context, “supporting the development, production and use of SAF in Africa, Latin America/Caribbean and Asia-Pacific” has been designated as a Global Gateway flagship initiative, identifying SAF as a critical priority.

A coordinated and coherent effort by “Team Europe”[1] could help ensure a transformative impact. This is also fully reflected in the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan adopted by the European Commission on November 4th 2025, which recognizes that mutually beneficial international partnerships remain critical to enhance access to markets, helping to secure imports of renewable and low-carbon fuels and feedstock materials, while facilitating the import/export of clean tech in line with the recently adopted ‘Global Europe’ regulation proposal.

The EIB and the EBRD, as Team Europe members, as well as the African Development Bank as a MDB focused on Africa, welcome the opportunity to collaborate with the European Commission and with partner institutions, such as AU and the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), to explore pathways for scaling up development, production and deployment of SAF and other cleaner energies in Africa.

Recognizing a concerted effort involving significant investment, enabling policy and regulatory frameworks and robust technical expertise required to achieve the long-term global aspirational goal, and in light of each MDBs respective mandate and complementarity, the signatories to this statement signal their ambition to:

Engage with stakeholders across the aviation ecosystem to advance the development of SAF and other cleaner energies projects across African continent that are aligned with the global aviation goals, with EU ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation and the AU Continental Strategy for SAF, in line with the operation mandate, policies and procedures for each MDB.

Capitalise on the EU-funded programmes supporting the SAF and other clean energy projects.

Further leverage existing cooperation mechanisms, such as the ""ICAO Assistance, Capacity-building and Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (ACT-SAF) programme""[2] and the “ICAO FINVEST Hub”[3].

This joint statement highlights a collective recognition of Africa's pivotal role in the future of sustainable aviation. By working together, the EIB, EBRD, and AfDB aim to unlock Africa's potential to become a significant contributor to the global SAF and other cleaner energies supply, driving sustainable economic growth and a greener future for the continent.

The government expects that an application for development consent for a Northwest Runway at Heathrow Airport will be brought forward by the promoter of the scheme, the airport operator, Heathrow Airport Limited (HAL), after the review of the Airports National Policy Statement.","A third runway at Heathrow is another step closer to take off by 2035, as the Transport Secretary confirms today (25 November 2025) that Heathrow Airport Limited’s (HAL’s) proposal will be used as the scheme to progress the project.

The proposal will shape the review of the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS), which is the framework within which the planning decision on expansion at the airport will be made, and any amendments to the ANPS will be subject to consultation next summer.

As the UK’s only hub airport, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country, expanding Heathrow will attract international investment, boost Britain’s connectivity, and support economic growth to deliver the Plan for Change. This summer a record 23.4 million passengers travelled via Heathrow, highlighting the level of passenger demand.

After requesting further information last month from the remaining two promoters, the government has assessed that HAL’s proposal offers the most deliverable option and provides the greatest likelihood of meeting the government’s ambition for a decision on a development consent application within this parliament.

Any amendments to the ANPS will be consulted on next summer after the Transport Secretary committed to completing the process 3 years faster than production of the policy statement in 2018. This will provide an important opportunity for businesses, communities, and the wider aviation sector to have their say.

Selection of the scheme to inform the remainder of the review does not represent a final decision on a third runway scheme or design, and any amendments to the ANPS will be subject to consultation and parliamentary scrutiny next year. Exact details such as the length of the third runway, layout, and associated infrastructure implications will continue to be considered throughout the remainder of the ANPS review.

Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander said:

Heathrow is our only hub airport which supports trade, tourism and hundreds of thousands of jobs, underpinning prosperity not only in the South East but across the UK.

Today is another important step to enable a third runway and build on these benefits, setting the direction for the remainder of our work to get the policy framework in place for airport expansion. This will allow a decision on a third runway plan this parliament which meets our key tests including on the environment and economic growth.

We’re acting swiftly and decisively to get this project off the ground so we can realise its transformational potential for passengers, businesses, and our economy sooner.

The government has been clear expansion plans must meet the UK’s legally binding climate obligations alongside balancing delivering economic growth as well as air quality and noise obligations.

The independent Climate Change Committee will be consulted on as part of the review to ensure expansion is consistent with the net zero framework. Today the Transport Secretary has written to the committee requesting advice including on the role of aviation in achieving the UK’s carbon budgets and inviting feedback on proposed updates to the ANPS to ensure alignment with climate commitments.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said:

We’re taking action where previous governments hesitated, and moving forward with Heathrow’s third runway to drive economic growth, international investment and better connections for our country.

That means opening the door to new growth and opportunity with Heathrow expansion – creating over 100,000 jobs, boosting our economy, and giving businesses and communities the certainty they need to thrive.

A swift and robust review of the ANPS was launched last month to consider airport expansion in light of new environmental and climate obligations and sets out the government’s criteria to consider future planning applications.

The selection of HAL’s scheme at this stage follows a rigorous assessment of the promoter’s proposals. This has determined that HAL’s proposal includes expansion plans that are resilient and efficient.

The government expects that an application for development consent for a Northwest Runway at Heathrow Airport will be brought forward by the promoter of the scheme, the airport operator, Heathrow Airport Limited (HAL), after the review of the Airports National Policy Statement.

The government is also pressing ahead with modernising airspace across the UK, to deliver quicker, quieter, and more efficient flights with lower emissions, reducing the sector’s climate change impacts.

The newly published Airspace Design Strategic Objectives will mean that the Greater London airspace block will be given priority in airspace modernisation processes. London’s airspace – which sees over 1.1 million takes offs and landings a year – will be redrawn to ensure the capital’s skies are ready for more departures from a third runway from 2035. This will also benefit passengers after record levels of people flying over the summer, by shortening flight routes and improving resilience in the sector.

A consultation has also been launched on simplifying the Air Navigation Guidance to set clear priorities, save carbon emissions, and ensure that people continue to have a meaningful say on airspace changes that affect them.

Today’s milestone follows the approval of Luton expansion earlier this year and Gatwick expansion last month, as the government continues to back aviation projects that will grow the economy and provide highly skilled jobs.

The government is backing the development of green aviation through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill. This bill will ensure Heathrow contributes to the UK meeting its climate targets by providing economic security for the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market by guaranteeing a set price per unit for UK producers.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-11-25 10:57:00.597804

At the same time, the entire industry is closely watching what the Senate will decide regarding free carry-on and checked baggage on flights in Brazil.

In the third quarter, the three airlines expanded seat capacity while maintaining strong load factors. The favorable supply scenario led to an increase in the average yield (the price paid per passenger to fly one kilometer) across the board. On average, the indicator rose 4.78%, to $0.089.

According to data from the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC), Brazilian domestic aviation reached the mark of 9 million passengers transported in October, up 9.1% year over year. The result sets a record for the month since official records began in 2000. ANAC noted that October’s volume was so strong that it became the fourth-largest monthly total ever recorded in the country—behind only January 2015 and January 2020, both with 9.3 million passengers, and July 2025, also with 9 million travelers.

Latam is currently the market leader, with about 40% of domestic demand in Brazil. The company closed the third quarter with net earnings of $379 million, a 25.8% increase year over year, supported by higher demand as well as fuel that was 11% cheaper. Revenue rose 17.3% to $3.85 billion. Brazil, considering both domestic and international operations, accounts for roughly 50% of the Latam group as a whole.

Carinata cleared for aviation fuel production

Given the third-quarter results and prospects for the final three months of the year, Latam raised its EBITDAR guidance (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or lease costs) from $3.65 billion–$3.85 billion to $4 billion–$4.1 billion.

With strong demand, Latam’s leadership announced new routes for next year. The company expects to operate in 63 domestic destinations in Brazil, compared with 59 today.

Latam Brasil CEO Jerome Cadier said there is room for further growth, noting that the group expects to receive at least 12 Embraer E2 aircraft next year. The routes to be operated with the Brazilian manufacturer’s model should be announced in early 2026.

Another company pushing to expand its flight offering in Brazil is Gol. After completing its Chapter 11 restructuring in the United States, the airline managed to return aircraft to service that had been grounded due to a lack of funds for maintenance. As a result, the company reached an average operational fleet of 119 aircraft in the third quarter, 13 more than in the same period last year.

With more aircraft available, the company transported 8.8 million passengers, up 10.7%. Revenue totaled R$5.5 billion, an 11.6% increase.

The completion of the restructuring led Gol’s debt to fall 21.6%, to R$19.6 billion. Less leveraged, the airline posted net income of R$248 million in the quarter, reversing losses of R$1.42 billion a year earlier.

Azul, which is also undergoing a Chapter 11 process, likewise saw significant gains in its operation. The company closed the quarter with net revenue of R$5.7 billion, up 11.8% year over year.

With its debt weighing on the balance sheet, however, Azul ended the quarter with a net loss of R$1.37 billion, reversing the R$121 million profit recorded a year earlier. The company’s financial result was a negative R$1.9 billion, a 200% increase in losses compared with the same period last year, which contributed to the red ink on the bottom line.

Beyond demand trends, the industry is now closely following discussions in Congress regarding baggage regulations for flights.

On October 28, the Chamber of Deputies (Lower House) approved a bill that prohibits the sale of tickets without a carry-on baggage allowance in Brazil’s domestic market. The opinion from the bill’s rapporteur, Congressman Neto Carletto, mandates free transport of carry-on bags and personal items weighing up to 12 kg on flights.

Lawmakers also approved an amendment reinstating free checked bags of up to 23 kg on both domestic and international flights. The free allowance had been suspended in 2017 and reaffirmed in 2021. The issue is sensitive for the sector, which is awaiting the bill’s next steps in the Senate.

Meanwhile, one opportunity on the horizon is a credit line backed by the National Civil Aviation Fund (FNAC). A total of R$4 billion from the fund will be made available for loans across six financing lines that range from purchasing Brazilian-made aircraft to acquiring domestically produced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

However, airlines argue that under the current terms, the credit line would be impossible for them to access, as they would not meet the requirements set by the government.

In a recent interview with Valor, ANAC president Tiago Faierstein acknowledged that the current rules may limit the industry’s interest. He noted that discussions are underway between the government and airlines to adjust the conditions.",http://s.glbimg.com/en/ho/static/globocom2012/img/fb_marca.png,N,,2025-11-25 12:56:39.337180

Hydrogen is more than a fuel - it’s a strategic energy vector that can decarbonize industries, power transport, and stabilize grids.
Its potential to store energy long-term and enable sustainable fuels like ammonia and aviation fuel makes could make it a key component of the clean energy future.","The physical and net zero characteristics of hydrogen are long-established but figuring out long term use cases, particularly at scale, is the real challenge. Globally, there is huge appetite in many countries and sectors for hydrogen production and development of hydrogen derivatives, such as sustainable aviation fuel and ammonia.

However, the sector suffers from constant and frequently exaggerated comparisons to other energy sectors - including fossil based and clean energy sources. To date, most global sources of energy have benefitted from historic subsidies and, for example, socialised infrastructure costs such as transportation and shipping.

Although the sector is still in its infancy, and nobody disputes the very real physical challenges to large scale deployment, the appetite to develop and integrate coherent national and international use cases for hydrogen is accelerating. This is underpinned by its potential to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors, enable long-term energy storage and create new industrial opportunities.

As governments and businesses race toward net-zero targets, hydrogen offers a versatile solution that could reshape energy systems for decades to come.

Ireland’s Hydrogen Strategy, published in 2023, and the EU’s broader policy framework, including RePowerEU and the Fit for 55 package, both reflect ambitious goals to integrate hydrogen into core energy policy.

Potential applications across sectors

Industrial Decarbonisation

Heavy industries that are difficult to electrify such as steel, cement, and chemicals account for a significant share of global emissions. Hydrogen can replace coal and natural gas in these applications, enabling deep decarbonization without compromising productivity.

Transport and Mobility

Hydrogen fuel cells are gaining traction in heavy-duty transport; trucks, buses, trains, and ships, where battery solutions face limitations in range and weight. Hydrogen-derived synthetic fuels and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) are being developed to reduce emissions in long-haul flights.

Power Generation and Grid Stability

Hydrogen can be used in gas turbines or fuel cells to generate electricity, providing flexible backup power for grids dominated by intermittent renewables.

Data Centres

Data centres account for a significant and growing share of national electricity demand. As a clean, dispatchable energy source, hydrogen can help power data centres while reducing reliance on fossil fuels and easing grid congestion.

Ammonia and Global Trade

Green hydrogen enables low-carbon ammonia production, essential for fertilizers and used as a hydrogen carrier for international transport.

Benefits and Opportunities

Long-Term Storage

One of hydrogen’s most compelling advantages is its ability to store large amounts of energy for extended periods, something batteries arguably cannot achieve economically at scale. Seasonal storage of hydrogen can help balance renewable generation.

Market Momentum

Although hydrogen is still in its early stages, the pace of development is significant:

Global hydrogen projects have surged in recent years, with billions committed to infrastructure and technology.

Governments are introducing subsidies, tax credits, and mandates to accelerate adoption.

Regions with abundant renewable resources, such as the Middle East, Australia, and parts of Europe, are positioning themselves as future hydrogen exporters.

Challenges Ahead

Despite its promise, hydrogen faces hurdles: high production costs, limited infrastructure, and uncertain demand.

Domestically and internationally, the hydrogen sector today mirrors the development of renewables generally in the past, nascent and full of promise yet clear hurdles that need to be overcome.

Crucially, at this stage, there is a far higher acceptance of the core role the energy transition now plays in the Irish economy , particularly across power generation, security and resilience of supply.

Hydrogen is more than a fuel - it’s a strategic energy vector that can decarbonize industries, power transport, and stabilize grids. Its potential to store energy long-term and enable sustainable fuels like ammonia and aviation fuel makes could make it a key component of the clean energy future.

While challenges remain, the growth in projects and investment signals that hydrogen is moving from concept to reality.",https://www.pinsentmasons.com/-/media/images/seo-social-media/editorial-use-only/energy/gettyimages-112635374_digital---seosocialeditorial-image.jpg?rev=7bacb2907bb543c49992dbe6a322cded,N,,2025-11-25 10:57:04.790436

Bell 505 achieves SAF milestone with 700 flight hours

Bell Textron announced at European Rotors 2025 that a single, dedicated Bell 505 has now exceeded 700 flight hours using blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This achievement marks a significant step forward in Bell’s wider sustainability drive and underscores the company’s commitment to accelerating SAF adoption across its flight operations.

Robin Wendling, Managing Director for Europe at Bell, said the milestone reinforces the industry’s broader carbon reduction goals. He noted that Bell’s collaboration with Safran Helicopter Engines has provided a vital advantage in testing and advancing greener aviation technologies.

The partnership began in March 2022, when Bell and Safran Helicopter Engines launched a joint initiative to study the technical performance and economic impact of SAF in the Bell 505, powered by the Arrius 2R engine. Less than a year later, the Bell 505 became the first single-engine helicopter to complete a demonstration flight operating on 100% SAF. Since July 2022, Bell has logged more than 700 flight hours using blended SAF on a single Bell 505 at the Bell Training Academy. Evaluations covering engine operability, aircraft performance, and detailed engine inspections have all delivered strong, positive results.

Jean-François Sauer, Safran Helicopter Engines, EVP Programs, commented, “We are particularly pleased with these SAF flights in partnership with Bell. SAF is key towards more sustainable helicopter use. The Arrius 2R, like all our engines, are currently able to operate with up to 50% drop-in SAF. Very soon, our engines will be capable of 100% drop-in SAF, paving the way for wider use of this type of fuel for increased sustainability of helicopter operations.”

The Bell 505 remains one of the most advanced platforms in its category, combining the Safran Arrius 2R engine with dual-channel FADEC and the Garmin G1000H NXi all-glass avionics suite, complete with moving map display. Its panoramic windows, open cabin design, and Synthetic Vision technology make it a versatile five-seat aircraft suited to public safety, utility work, and military training.

While Australia and China are positioned as potential production powerhouses due to their vast renewable resources and industrial CO2 sources, other key economies face significant infrastructure and resource hurdles.
Renewable electricity: Australia and China lead the way with exceptional solar and wind potential, although renewable electricity demand is rising rapidly.
Most APAC economies remain coal-dependent, limiting near-term renewable surplus for PtX production.
CO2 sources: Industrial CO2 is abundant in China and India, but direct air capture technology remains pre-commercial and prohibitively expensive.","Australia and China hold the strongest industrial and renewable energy foundations to drive the Asia-Pacific's transition to Power-to-X aviation fuels. However, the broader region remains hamstrung by ""uneven readiness"" and policy fragmentation, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials said Nov. 24 in a report.

In its first integrated assessment of the region, titled ""PtX and Sustainable Aviation: A Roadmap for Asia-Pacific,"" the RSB identified a distinct divide in the region's capacity to scale Power-to-Liquids and Power-and-Biomass-to-Liquids fuels.

While Australia and China are positioned as potential production powerhouses due to their vast renewable resources and industrial CO2 sources, other key economies face significant infrastructure and resource hurdles.

Divergent regional roles

The report categorizes the APAC market into distinct clusters, highlighting that no single country currently meets all enabling conditions for rapid deployment.

""Australia and China hold the strongest industrial and energy foundations,"" the RSB said, pointing to Australia's developing coastal hydrogen hubs and China's massive renewable generation capacity as critical assets for the sector.

Advanced economies such as Japan, South Korea, and Singapore were identified as leaders in governance, technology, and trading infrastructure; however, the report warned that they face explicit ""geographic and infrastructure constraints"" regarding raw materials.

Emerging economies such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand offer significant potential for biomass feedstock; however, they are currently limited by water stress, land-use pressures, and fragmented policy landscapes.

Barriers to scale

The RSB warned that the region's diversity creates both opportunities and structural risks. The road map outlined six ""interlinked structural challenges"" preventing PtX from scaling beyond niche projects: policy inconsistency, infrastructure gaps, financing and risk, inconsistent certification systems, and limited stakeholder capacity outside of major industrial economies.

No single country in the APAC region can independently cover all critical dimensions for PtX fuel scale-up, including renewable power, CO2 sources, feedstock supply, industrial capacity, and governance alignment.

Renewable electricity: Australia and China lead the way with exceptional solar and wind potential, although renewable electricity demand is rising rapidly. Most APAC economies remain coal-dependent, limiting near-term renewable surplus for PtX production.

Green hydrogen: Demand for hydrogen offtake agreements is concentrated in Japan, South Korea, and Australia, with China scaling rapidly but lagging in export frameworks. India is emerging as a significant producer of hydrogen, but it faces water stress constraints.

Biomass residues: India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand offer vast potential for agricultural residues — such as rice straw, sugarcane bagasse, palm, and forestry residues — yet their supply chains remain fragmented, and deforestation risks necessitate strict sustainability safeguards.

CO2 sources: Industrial CO2 is abundant in China and India, but direct air capture technology remains pre-commercial and prohibitively expensive. The road map warns that reliance on fossil-derived CO2 poses a ""transition risk"" and undermines the credibility of PtX.

Technology readiness levels:

PtL and PBtL pathways remain at pilot or early-demonstration stage. Current cost estimates are $3,800-8,600/metric tons versus $600-900/mt for fossil jet fuel, a gap wider than HEFA-SAF. The road map projects cost competitiveness only after 2040, as renewable electricity prices decline.

PtL-FT (Power-to-Liquids via Fischer-Tropsch): ASTM D7566 approved, TRL 6-7 (pilot-to-demo)

PBtL-GFT (Power-and-Biomass-to-Liquids): ASTM approved, TRL 6-7 (pilot-to-demo)

PtL-MtJ (Power-to-Methanol-to-Jet): Not yet approved, TRL 5-6 (demo stage)

PBtL-MtJ (Biomass-to-Methanol-to-Jet): Not approved, TRL 5-6 (demo stage)

Strategic road map

To bridge the readiness gap, the RSB called for coordinated regional cooperation rather than isolated national strategies. The road map suggests connecting the resource-rich ""opportunity clusters"" —such as Australia's hydrogen hubs and India's feedstock bases — with the technology and finance centers in Singapore, Japan, and South Korea.

Key recommendations for the next decade include aligning certification systems to facilitate cross-border trade, developing shared infrastructure corridors, and integrating future aviation demand into national renewable energy planning.

""The coming decade will determine whether PtX fuels become a niche innovation or a cornerstone of aviation decarbonization in APAC,"" the report concluded.

Direct SAF blending mandates remain scarce across the APAC region. Only Singapore and South Korea have enacted binding SAF mandates (Singapore: 1% by 2026, rising to 3-5% by 2030; South Korea: 1% from 2027). Japan is consulting on a 10% target by 2030, while China's binding timeline remains undefined.

Drop-in sustainable aviation fuel is one of the few scalable pathways to reduce emissions in an industry where electrification and alternative energy carriers are extraordinarily difficult,” Werner says.
This year in Georgia, LanzaJet became the first to commercially produce jet fuel from ethanol.","The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market is expected to reach nearly $66 billion by 2030 and soar to $655 billion by 2050, and jet fuel tech developers are latching on to waste as feedstock to meet demand. The first innovators have focused largely on agricultural byproducts, but there isn’t enough of the material to satiate airlines’ appetites as they commit to net-zero carbon by 2050. So, some developers are beginning to look at biogas from landfills, wastewater treatment plants, and dairy manure.

The University of Sydney developed a plasma technology to convert landfill gas into SAF. Syzygy Plasmonics says its system can also make SAF from landfill and wastewater biogas, among waste stream byproducts. Now, startup Circularity Fuels is working to make a go in this nascent but growing niche. The Redwood, California, company is beginning with dairy manure.

It seemed like a good pathway due to California’s low carbon-fuel standards (LCFS) incentive program, says Stephen Beaton, a jet fuel scientist turned entrepreneur who launched Circularity Fuels in 2023.

“By converting that gas, we're displacing fossil fuel. But we are also preventing the venting of methane through the atmosphere. So, we get more subsidies and incentives for the fuel,” he says.

Beaton believes SAF can open a lot more opportunities for the renewable natural gas (RNG) industry at a time when existing markets, mainly fuel for bus and truck fleet operators, are becoming increasingly saturated. Some developers are having a harder time getting their products into the few states that dole out incentives for RNG as transportation fuel.

“We can take advantage of many of the same subsidies, credits, and corporate programs by producing fuel for aviation in a market that is almost infinitely scalable,” Beaton says.

Still, there is more biogas worldwide than all the fuel-hungry airlines combined require. So the feedstock exists. The key to scaling is more a matter of developing technology and equipment that are affordable to deploy, which takes time.

In an earlier day, Beaton worked on novel fuels for the Air Force, then at the Pentagon, standing up the Air Force's synthetic aviation program. He has since spent years trying to figure out how to make jet fuel at scale and cheaper than has been done to date. Something a little different about Circularity’s model is that the company owns both primary steps of the process that follow anaerobic digestion: making the fuel precursor, syngas, then converting that syngas into jet fuel.

Verticalizing the technology stack to be able to perform the whole process in-house is generating cost and energy efficiencies, as is the technology itself. The system, which uses a modified automotive catalytic converter, is more compact and cheaper to run than traditional methane reforming equipment. Not having to filter out the carbon dioxide (CO2) from the waste stream helps.

“We actually use the CO2 in the process, which allows us to make more syngas per unit of biogas. And by combining the methane and CO2, the syngas is naturally at the ratio required for liquid fuel production [bypassing additional steps],” Beaton says.

While Beaton focuses on finetuning the first on-farm demo, he is thinking ahead, talking with landfills, feedlots, and wastewater treatment plants as well as biogas and RNG developers who are looking for outlets for their gas. On the offtake side, the young company so far has nondisclosure agreements with about half a dozen airlines. Optimizing is a slow-going process as there are some fundamental but complex principles to prove out.

Today’s pilot produces about a gallon of jet fuel a day. The plan is to scale to 100 million gallons per year by the mid-2030s. That would fuel roughly 10,000 transatlantic flights – about 35 million miles of long-haul air travel, Beaton says. So far, he and his team have secured about $9.5 million in seed funding and grants from venture capital firms, the National Science Foundation, California Energy Commission, and others.

The primary funder, DCVC, brought the startup into its entrepreneur-in-residence program, which backs “deep tech” developers aiming to transform underused or low-grade resources into valued products at scale. Producing fuels from waste fits squarely with that focus, says Milo Werner, a partner at DCVC focused on climate.

“Aviation is a natural priority because it is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. Drop-in sustainable aviation fuel is one of the few scalable pathways to reduce emissions in an industry where electrification and alternative energy carriers are extraordinarily difficult,” Werner says.

What stood out about Beaton and his team is that they found a way to avoid costly pre-treatment steps and infrastructure barriers that limit traditional reforming technologies (there is no need for a connection to a pipeline).

“Their approach has potential to bring down the cost of SAF production by an order of magnitude. That combination of technical advantage, cost disruption, and applicability to a hard-to-abate sector made Circularity a compelling investment,” Werner says.

Countries around the world are providing incentives and/or implementing SAF mandates to take these emerging technologies further. And these policies are driving demand. Commercial airlines are leaning in to figure out how to secure SAF years in advance of production. Right now, what product is available to them comes with sticker shock. Compared to the roughly $2.50 per gallon cost of traditional jet diesel, airlines pay $7 or $8 per gallon for clean fuels. Renewables that do not come from crop waste, and therefore don’t compete with food production, cost more. Making it more affordable is a work in progress.

Other issues are tough competition for the more widely used feedstocks (ag byproducts) and the availability of energy as companies compete for this resource too. Then there is regulatory uncertainty, particularly in the U.S., where the landscape has shifted.

While the Inflation Reduction Act created a $1.75 a gallon credit for SAF, that figure recently dropped to $1 per gallon. Now several members of Congress have introduced bills aiming to bolster incentives. Airlines can still tap into RINS credits through the U.S. EPA. Though key programs once offered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture have stalled, with uncertainty over whether they will reopen.

But slowly, a few domestic SAF projects are coming online and scaling up, with a handful more slated to launch soon. This year in Georgia, LanzaJet became the first to commercially produce jet fuel from ethanol. In Texas, Diamond Green Diesel is making SAF from used cooking oil and animal byproducts; with an annual capacity of 70 million tons, the corporation is reportedly the world’s largest producer of waste-based jet fuel.

But airlines will need 500 million tons of SAF a year to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association. As far as Beaton’s contribution, admittedly, he says, if he meets his aspired targets, he alone will only make a dent. Though he is an optimist. He sees potential for healthy growth ahead in a budding industry.

“California scaled quickly from a very small percentage of compressed natural gas to essentially having 100% of vehicles run on biogas today. We think that scale can exist [for SAF].”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt4a147f9e36f0754a/blt88dcb6ad44d503e5/69248db04df136c21f6aaf99/jet_fuel_2_1540.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-25 08:56:38.204099

The collaboration aims to explore pathways for developing economically feasible SAF production and supply infrastructure in Dubai, with ENOC evaluating its potential contribution to local production. A joint steering committee will guide the evaluation.

As a safe and fully certified drop-in fuel compatible with existing aircraft fleet and airport infrastructure, SAF can be blended with conventional jet fuel at a ratio of up to 50%, creating an aviation fuel that is significantly lower in lifecycle carbon emissions. In its neat form, SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.*

Emirates is actively engaged in advancing the UAE's sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem through membership in the Technical Group under the Aviation Fuels Executive Committee, convened by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, and the Dubai Biofuels, Hydrogen and Sustainable Aviation Fuel Committee, established by the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy.

The airline has contributed to the UAE's General Policy for Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which aims to transform the UAE into a regional hub for alternative aviation fuels with production targets of 700 million litres by 2030. Additionally, Emirates and the UAE GCAA have played key roles in developing the UAE's power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels roadmap, driven by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure and the World Economic Forum.

Emirates also spearheaded SAF demonstration flights on its Boeing 777 and A380 aircraft. In January 2023, the airline operated a Boeing 777 flight using 100% SAF in one engine, and in November 2023 conducted the first A380 demonstration flight using 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its four engines.

This will include case studies and scorecard templates which will allow buyers to make sustainable and data-driven decisions in procurement.

We’re proud to be recognized by SPLC, a respected leader in sustainable procurement. This recognition reinforces our conviction that strong collaboration across the travel supply chain can lead to meaningful transformation. Sustainable procurement is no longer optional—it’s becoming the foundation for how responsible businesses operate, and we’re excited to help drive that shift. Kelsey Frenkiel, Director of Sustainability at the GBTA Foundation

SPLC is delighted to acknowledge GBTA Foundation’s superb leadership in the field of sustainable procurement. The GBTA Foundation’s creative methodology and demonstrated, measurable impact underscore the vital, transformative role sustainable procurement plays. Their success offers a compelling example for organizations globally aiming to create a better future. Marc Heisterkamp, SPLC CEO

The SPLC Leadership Awards ceremony will be held virtually on Wednesday, December 3, at 2:00 pm EST. Registration details can be found on the SPLC Calendar of Events.

Under the partnership, Landmark Group will adopt DHL’s GoGreen Plus programme to reduce Scope 3 emissions across its international shipments using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The Group operates more than 2,200 retail stores across 21 countries and employs over 50,000 people, giving the agreement wide regional impact.

GoGreen Plus shifts away from traditional carbon-offsetting models by replacing fossil-based jet fuel with SAF produced from renewable feedstocks.

Each tonne of SAF used can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 80%, with reductions independently verified and certified by SGS for full accountability.

SAF deployment brings measurable reductions

The agreement was formalised in Dubai by Mahmoud Haj Hussein, Country Manager of DHL Express UAE, and Rajesh Garg, Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Sustainability Officer at Landmark Group.

Haj Hussein said that “DHL has committed to investing €7 billion globally in climate-neutral logistics by 2030, and partnerships like this demonstrate how we’re translating that ambition into measurable action,”

Adding, “Landmark Group’s decision to adopt GoGreen Plus reflects how progressive enterprises are keen on moving the industry toward a net-zero future.”

Garg said the partnership embeds sustainability deeper into the Group’s regional logistics footprint. “Our partnership with DHL marks an important step in reducing our Scope 3 emissions and advancing our decarbonisation goals through credible solutions like Sustainable Aviation Fuel.”

Alignment with UAE Net Zero 2050

The collaboration supports the UAE’s national Net Zero 2050 strategy, which positions the country as a global leader in climate action and sustainable economic development.

Scope 3 emissions, often the largest and most complex to address, remain the primary challenge for retail supply chains. DHL and Landmark said SAF adoption provides one of the most immediate and scalable pathways to lower-carbon logistics.

Beyond sustainability, Subhas urged governments to take a more active role in strengthening the region’s aviation supply chain.","The Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) has described Singapore’s upcoming sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy as an important push to encourage greater production and use of cleaner fuels in aviation, reports New Straits Times.

AAPA director general Subhas Menon said the levy is designed to motivate action, noting that travellers often express support for sustainability but do not always follow through.

He said many passengers claim they are willing to contribute to sustainability efforts, including supporting SAF, but often “words and actions do not match,” and the levy acts as the needed reminder.

According to him, most travellers are unlikely to object to paying between S$1 and S$41—depending on destination and travel class—because the money supports a meaningful cause.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore announced on November 10 that the SAF levy will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing Singapore from October 1, 2026. Charges will vary by distance and cabin class.

Subhas said Singapore has also assured the public that their contributions will be used properly. The levy will go directly toward the purchase of SAF, managed by the newly established Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Co Ltd. (SAFCo), which will handle procurement on behalf of the country.

He described Singapore’s model as a combination of firm government commitment and public willingness to support sustainability.

While the levy has drawn widespread attention, Subhas said it is unlikely that other Asia-Pacific countries will adopt a similar approach, as each government has different needs and policy structures.

“There is no one-size-fits-all,” he said, noting that countries are taking different pathways to increase SAF use.

Japan, for instance, is pursuing a public–private partnership model supported by its large supply of used cooking oil, creating new income opportunities for communities involved in collecting and processing it.

Malaysia, he added, has also laid out long-term plans to build domestic SAF production capacity, targeting significant output by 2050.

Subhas said most Asia-Pacific countries already have policies and regulations in place to expand SAF use, with the region now showing much faster progress than two years ago. He said these efforts are expected to lead to at least five percent SAF usage across the region.

Beyond sustainability, Subhas urged governments to take a more active role in strengthening the region’s aviation supply chain. He said airlines have repeatedly been called upon to push the sector forward, but governments also need to recognise aviation as a long-term economic opportunity worthy of investment.

He said governments can help local companies become regional suppliers of aircraft components—similar to efforts underway in China—and support investments in maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities and the broader aviation aftermarket.

On rising concerns over passengers carrying lithium-ion batteries, Subhas said airlines face challenges because different countries follow different rules, causing confusion among travellers.

He noted that some airlines believe no action is needed, while others want clearer guidelines. However, he stressed that regulators—not airlines—should issue the necessary rules.

He added that if regulators do not act, the association is willing to propose recommendations based on established safety procedures.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-14.png,N,,2025-11-25 08:58:46.100604

The initiative is expected to reduce emissions by up to 90%, supporting PIL’s long-term sustainability goals, reports Business Today.

Sriram Iyer, Chief Operating Officer of PIL, said SAF offers strong potential to advance climate targets while meeting the needs of air freight. He noted that as the push toward net-zero gains speed, renewable fuels provide a clear route to reducing emissions and the partnership with DHL reflects PIL’s commitment to greener operations and better carbon performance.

PIL, a global player in the edible oil and consumer goods industry, already manages its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions according to the GHG Protocol. By joining GoGreen Plus, it is also addressing Scope 3 emissions, which include indirect emissions from supply chain activities.

Sustainable aviation fuel, produced from materials such as used cooking oil and other waste, can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. DHL’s GoGreen Plus programme uses a book-and-claim model, allowing the environmental benefits of SAF to be credited to customers even when their shipments are not physically transported using SAF.

Julian Neo, Managing Director of DHL Express Malaysia and Brunei, said the company is pleased to have Pacific Inter-Link join the programme and help build wider acceptance of SAF as an important tool for lowering aviation emissions.

He added that both companies are taking key steps to scale the technology and speed up the shift toward solutions that can cut emissions across logistics operations, while continuing efforts to improve SAF production, supply and availability.

“We often say it’s not the producer who chooses carinata, it’s carinata that chooses the producer,” he said.

With harvesting completed in recent weeks, yields easily surpassed initial projections, paving the way for rapid expansion.

Commercial planting covered 100,000 hectares under agreements between farmers and Australia’s Nufarm, which supplied the seeds. The company also secured firm offtake contracts with BP, which uses carinata oil at its SAF biorefineries in Europe.

In Mato Grosso do Sul, which led national planting with 10,000 hectares and has nearly finished its harvest, average yields reached 30 bags per hectare. Although one of the lowest averages among producing states, the result was well above Nufarm’s initial national estimate of 20 to 25 bags per hectare.

Carinata was planted in eight states. All Cerrado areas performed above expectations. In Mato Grosso, yields ranged from 30 to 35 bags per hectare, while in Goiás they averaged 33. Paraná posted roughly 37 bags per hectare. Harvesting is still underway in Rio Grande do Sul, the country’s second-largest producer with 7,500 hectares.

According to Phillipp Minarelli, Nufarm Brasil’s carinata manager, the strong results reflect the profile of the producers selected for this first commercial cycle. “We often say it’s not the producer who chooses carinata, it’s carinata that chooses the producer,” he said. The crop is well suited as a cover crop, planted after soybeans and corn as part of soil-conservation practices typically adopted by farmers with more advanced management systems. “These are farmers who already work to keep soil covered and take care when planting,” he said.

So far, all harvests have comfortably exceeded the breakeven point of 15 to 18 bags per hectare, Minarelli said. Compared with other potential SAF feedstocks, carinata has both lower production costs and a smaller carbon footprint. On average, each megajoule of energy produced from carinata-based SAF emits 14 grams of CO₂, compared with 68 grams from soybean-oil-based SAF, he said. The low carbon intensity will likely boost demand from aviation, a sector facing binding decarbonization targets starting in 2027.

One factor that makes carinata more sustainable than soy is its lower need for nitrogen fertilizers, the largest source of agricultural emissions. “Some farmers in Paraná applied no nitrogen at all and will still harvest 30 bags,” Minarelli said.

Carinata also generates abundant crop residue and has deep roots that improve soil aeration, benefiting the following summer soybean crop. “It makes soybean planting easier, with less diesel consumption and less soil compaction,” he said. And because it belongs to a different botanical family than oilseeds and cereals, carinata helps break pest and disease cycles in grain-producing areas, potentially reducing pesticide use.

There are advantages on the industrial side as well. Carinata seeds contain 38% to 45% oil, roughly twice the oil yield of soybeans.

The crop also stands out among winter alternatives for its resilience to extreme weather. Native to Ethiopia, carinata tolerates temperatures above 30°C and withstands frost. That resilience proved critical this year, when some winter fields endured four frost events and remained intact, while crops like wheat and sugarcane suffered yield losses.

Nufarm aims to double its planted area in Brazil by 2026 through expanded partnerships with producers.

Oil

Last year, when Nufarm conducted pilot trials, the harvested carinata had to be shipped to Belgium for processing. This season, carinata grown in Brazil will be processed domestically at a canola-crushing facility opened this year by Celena Alimentos and Grupo Camera in São Luiz Gonzaga, Rio Grande do Sul. With that, Brazil will begin exporting carinata oil.

In October, the facility conducted a test crush of 2,500 tonnes of carinata, producing both oil and meal. Unlike canola oil, carinata oil is toxic for human consumption, requiring chemical treatment to remove harmful compounds.

Laboratory analyses have already confirmed that carinata meal contains adequate protein levels for feed use. Additional testing is expected to certify the removal of toxic elements, according to Vantuir Scarantti, agricultural manager at Celena Alimentos.

Once meal viability is fully confirmed, the plant is expected to process carinata for one month each year, crushing 20,000 tonnes, while canola will be processed during the remaining 11 months. As domestic output expands, the facility could extend carinata crushing time, either by reducing canola throughput or increasing overall capacity, Scarantti said.

In the coming years, Nufarm expects Brazil’s planned SAF plants to internalize the entire production chain. By 2030, SAF production is slated to begin at the Refinaria de Petróleo Riograndense (RPR) in Rio Grande (Rio Grande do Sul), at Petrobras’s refinery in Cubatão (São Paulo), and at an OilGroup facility under development in Bacabeira (Maranhão).
