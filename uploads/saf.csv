Now known as Par Hawaii East, the facility is the site of Hawaii’s first SAF project.
However, the state’s carbon reduction mandate requires the utilities to provide 100% renewable energy by 2045, according to Wright.
“The renewable fuel we’re making is going to help the utilities hit their mandated renewable energy goals.
After the technology was proved out, Par Pacific moved forward with the technology, installing it in their new system.","More than 2,400 miles from the mainland U.S., energy company Par Pacific Holdings Inc. serves as Hawaii’s lone refinery. In 2023, the company decided to add sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel to their product portfolio, creating a unit focused on developing renewable fuels projects. This unit developed the Hawaii Renewables Project at the Par Hawaii East refinery near Kapolei, Hawaii. Currently, the refinery’s capacity stand at 94,000 barrels per day (b/d) of conventional fuel. In 2023, the company committed to converting one of its units into a hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) process. When operation begins, the renewables unit will produce 4,000 b/d, or 60 MMgy, of renewable diesel and SAF.

Par Pacific made its debut in the Hawaiian market in 2013 with the purchase of a refinery formerly owned by Tesoro. Now known as Par Hawaii East, the facility is the site of Hawaii’s first SAF project.

Refining Resilience

The grit and determination of Par Pacific’s leadership led to its current market position, according to Jon Goldsmith, senior vice president of renewables with Par Pacific. When the then-startup company first entered the Hawaiian market, it was a case of David and Goliath, with Par competing against one of the world’s largest energy companies—Chevron. Tesoro was shuttering a 50-year-old refinery in Kapolei, a city on Hawaii’s Oahu Island. “We invested capital, we restarted the plant, and we were able to maintain all these critical jobs and on-island energy production,” he tells Biomass Magazine. “And Hawaii has limited high-quality manufacturing and industrial sector jobs.”

In 2016, Chevron sold its refinery to Island Energy Services. A few years later, the refinery was shuttered and Par Hawaii acquired most of the assets. Through strategic acquisitions of refineries from fuel suppliers, after seven years, Par Pacific emerged as the state’s only refiner. Not only playing a key role as a fuel supplier for the electrical grid, shipping and air transport, Par Hawaii also provides high-paying jobs in a market with few job options. Eric Wright, president of Par Hawaii, has lived in the state for eight years. Par Hawaii takes its role as one of few high-paying industrial employers very seriously. The refinery employs about 300 people, paying new workers $40 per hour.

“It’s not for everybody, but for people who are looking for a good career path, this is really a great option for them,” Wright says. “The renewable fuels project helps solidify our future and make sure that we stay relevant as a state pursues its clean energy goals.”

In-House Development

In 2019, the refinery invested in a distillate hydrogen treater, which removes sulfur from diesel and helps refiners hit the regulation specification of 15 parts per million. The unit ran for a couple years before the company observed the growth of the renewable fuels industry, and Par Pacific decided to explore converting the unit to a dedicated HEFA renewable fuels plant. In 2022, the company partnered with Hawaiian Airlines to explore SAF production. After a year of exploring the technical demands of the project with technology provider Topsoe, and as well as economic potential for SAF and renewable diesel production, Par Pacific committed to pressing forward on the project in 2023.

Goldsmith emphasizes the impressive capabilities of Par Hawaii’s experienced engineers, who allowed the company to develop, design and execute the project without hiring an engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Par Pacific’s new mission statement, “Humbly serving communities,” has been evidenced in the company’s engagement with the surrounding community, Goldsmith explains.

This in-house approach allowed Par Pacific to develop the 60 MMgy HEFA unit for less than $100 million dollars, a cost of around $1.50 per gallon. “If you look at other projects that have been announced, that’s relatively cheap and the reason for that is we have the refinery with a lot of existing infrastructure that we were able to utilize,” Wright says.

Combining Forces

Par Pacific recently announced the formation of Hawaii Renewables LLC, a joint venture company with Alohi Renewable Energy LLC (a partnership between Mitsubishi Corp. and ENEOS Corp., two of Japan’s largest energy and trading companies), where Par Pacific would contribute and operate the renewable fuel production assets in Hawaii.

The partnership will combine Par Pacific’s advantaged West Coast and Hawaii asset base and operational capabilities with improved market access via Mitsubishi’s terminal in Long Beach, California. Both ENEOS and Mitsubishi will enhance the business by leveraging their global integrated businesses and providing their technical, trading and feedstock origination capabilities across Asia-Pacific and North America.

“We are thrilled to be combining forces with Mitsubishi and ENEOS,” Goldsmith says. “We have been collaborating for well over a year and have had the opportunity to shape the partnership in a way that will bring value to all parties.”

Markets & Mandates

Hawaii is a unique market for renewable fuels, Wright explains. The state’s electrical grid primarily relies on diesel or fuel oil for power generation, with around 65% of the state’s energy derived from these sources. However, the state’s carbon reduction mandate requires the utilities to provide 100% renewable energy by 2045, according to Wright. “Liquid fuels will always be a part of the mix here,” he explains. “The renewable fuel we’re making is going to help the utilities hit their mandated renewable energy goals. But the great thing about our project is that we can sell the diesel to the utilities, and the sustainable aviation fuel we can sell to the airlines. The diesel can also go to the marine market shipping. So, we really hit a lot of different sectors of the economy with our project.”

The state must meet certain benchmarks progressing toward the ultimate goal of 100% renewable energy: 40% by 2030 and 70% by 2040. Hawaii’s liquid fuel demand stands at about 100,000 b/d, meaning that Par Hawaii’s renewable fuel unit will not overwhelm the market. Goldsmith explains that the max SAF volume is around 2,400 b/d, around 5% of the approximately 50,000 b/d jet fuel market. “The project scale is right-sized for the Hawaii market,” he says.

The infrastructure acquired and developed over the years enables the company to send products to market in a cost-efficient manner. Par Hawaii owns a 20-mile pipeline that runs from the refinery’s jet fuel storage to Honolulu Airport. Once production starts, the refinery can blend SAF with its conventional jet fuel and ship it down the pipeline, directly to the airport. “We’re very closely integrated with the airport and the jet fuel infrastructure in a way that a lot of other facilities aren’t,” Wright says.

Feedstock Flexibility

The unit is able to handle a wide range of feedstocks, including beef tallow, used cooking oil and more. To maximize economic benefits, Par Hawaii has installed an innovative, and first-of-its-kind pretreatment technology developed by Lutros LLC.

Par Pacific helped finance Lutros’ pilot plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. After the technology was proved out, Par Pacific moved forward with the technology, installing it in their new system. Wright explains that since the facility will utilize diverse feedstocks, pretreatment helps ensure that the oils are free of any contaminants that could poison the catalyst. The company recognized the importance of onsite pretreatment, rather than purchasing treated feedstock.

Collocating the renewable fuels unit alongside a refinery benefits the process in a number of ways. The presence of preexisting hydrogen infrastructure is one such benefit, according to Wright. Par Hawaii East used to process a lot of Alaskan crude oil, which has a high sulfur content. Due to that, the refinery added hydrogen to reach required fuel specifications. Currently, the refinery uses a “sweeter” crude slate with less sulfur, meaning that the hydrogen plants were underutilized.

The hydrogen is produced via a process similar to steam methane reforming but substituting propane for methane, the unit separates the carbon and hydrogen, allowing the hydrogen to be used in the SAF production. “The renewable fuels unit will actually, in the first stage of the unit, make a lot of renewable propane from the renewable feedstock,” Wright says. “And so, we’re able to feed that to the hydrogen unit and produce renewable hydrogen that then gets used to make the renewable fuel. We don’t make enough renewable propane to say … we’re using all green hydrogen, but we come pretty close.”

Currently, fuel production requires importing all feedstock by ship, both from the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. Jones Act requires cargo travelling from one U.S. port to another to be transported by a U.S.-built ship, flying a U.S. flag and crewed by Americans. Par Hawaii charters one of these ships under a long-term lease, which transports feedstock and products from Par Pacific’s refinery in Tacoma, Washington, out to Hawaii. Wright highlights that many HEFA plants use imported feedstock of some type, whether that be used cooking oil from Asia or canola oil from Canada.

A Second Life

Par Hawaii is already seeking solutions for its feedstock access challenges, exploring Hawaii-based feedstocks with Pono Pacific, the state’s largest private conservation company. The group tests the viability of growing various crops on fallow agricultural land across the state. One such crop is camelina, a promising HEFA feedstock.

Camelina has potential to not only serve as a feedstock for the oils needed for SAF, but also provide animal feed at an affordable price to livestock farmers within the state, explains Chris Bennett, vice president of sustainable energy solutions with Pono Pacific. The crop’s short growth cycle—80 to 100 days—could allow it to serve as a cover crop, rotating with food production during Hawaii’s long growing season. “If we’re successful, and we’re able to activate fallow lands, that actually means more land is in production,” Bennett says.

Pono completed pilot tests of several camelina varieties and identified the best strain for the region. The next step is to expand the project to 100-acre plots, with the five-year plan being to reach 50,000 acres. The ultimate goal is not to fully provide Par Hawaii’s feedstock, as there isn’t acreage available in the state to grow camelina at that scale, but Pono Pacific plans to provide 10% to 20% of the refinery’s feedstock if the project’s scale-up is successful.

“I think this is such a great project that shows that an oil refinery and a 25-year [old] land conservation company can find common ground and work together in a way that potentially could be very positive for the state of Hawaii,” Bennett says.

Hawaii’s unique, high-demand market offers a wide range of opportunities for renewable fuel producers. Renewable diesel demand originating from the cruise ship industry, marine fuel, electric grid and more, along with the state’s large, aviation fuel-reliant tourist industry and the state’s net-zero carbon emissions goals creates a perfect storm for renewable fuel demand. Although the logistics of feedstock supply and lack of a strong tax credit framework for renewable fuels constitute a challenge, they are not impossible to overcome. “I think it’s a great story that this refinery had a second life and now we’re making a big investment in it, and solidifying its future,” Wright adds. “As you can imagine, our people are really excited about it. It’s something new we get to learn how to do.”

MONTREAL – The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has introduced a set of significant updates to its global safety, security, and innovation frameworks during its latest Assembly, aligning with its strategic aspiration of achieving zero fatalities in aviation. Attended by representatives from all 192 ICAO Member States, the Assembly endorsed a range of actions to address emerging threats, enhance aviation oversight, and improve operational efficiency across the sector.

Key among the outcomes was the endorsement of the 2026–2028 Global Aviation Safety Plan, the eighth Global Air Navigation Plan, and the Second Edition of the Global Aviation Security Plan. Together, these plans form the cornerstone of ICAO’s forward strategy, providing a cohesive framework to harmonize regulatory standards and accelerate safety improvements at national and regional levels.

Conflict zone risks and cybersecurity

With growing threats from weaponized unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and radio frequency interference affecting Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), the Assembly mandated the ICAO Council to develop a dedicated conflict zone work programme and to revise critical guidance materials, such as the Risk Assessment Manual (Doc 10084).

In parallel, Member States were urged to implement ICAO’s Aviation Cybersecurity Strategy and Action Plan. This includes developing national cybersecurity frameworks, appointing competent authorities, and enhancing risk management processes tailored to the aviation sector.

Integration of AI and new airspace entrants

The Assembly also recognized the dual nature of artificial intelligence as both an opportunity and a challenge. It endorsed a new ICAO policy on innovation and approved the formation of a Task Force on AI, which will focus on implementation strategies, certification standards, and performance evaluation mechanisms specific to AI applications in aviation.

Additionally, the safe integration of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), and advanced air mobility (AAM) was prioritized. The Assembly called for expedited work on legal and operational frameworks for these new entrants, especially over high seas and across borders.

Strengthening audit oversight and regional cooperation

Member States reaffirmed their commitment to ICAO’s safety and security audit programmes, agreeing to timely participation in scheduled audits. The Assembly emphasized that audits provide critical data to prevent administrative disruptions and ensure the credibility of global oversight mechanisms.

Regional bodies such as RSOOs, RAIOs, and ICMs were also acknowledged for their role in supporting States with limited capacity. States were encouraged to enhance cooperation and contribute resources to strengthen regional capabilities in safety and security oversight.

Future-proofing systems and pilot policy review

The Assembly addressed the need to secure data link services, GNSS reliability, and cross-regional airspace coordination to support the global transition to Flight and Flow Information for a Collaborative Environment (FF-ICE).

Delegates also discussed the operational implications of new distress tracking technologies and reaffirmed ICAO’s role in enabling safe integration of space transport operations, in coordination with other UN agencies.

On the issue of pilot age limits, the Assembly agreed to continue a data-driven review. While no decision has been made, any potential increase of the age limit to 67 will be based strictly on evidence and safety data.

All new measures adopted are aligned with the Muscat Declaration and ICAO’s Strategic Plan for 2050, reinforcing the Organization’s long-term vision of safe, secure, and sustainable aviation growth. These outcomes aim to future-proof global aviation while ensuring States have the frameworks and support to address evolving challenges.

ICAO strengthens global aviation sustainability framework to support net-zero targets

Also, ICAO has taken a significant step toward accelerating the decarbonization of international aviation by adopting new global measures during its latest Assembly. These decisions strengthen ICAO’s long-term sustainability vision and reinforce international cooperation, investment, and implementation mechanisms to meet the sector’s net-zero carbon emissions goal by 2050.

The measures directly align with ICAO’s Strategic Plan for 2050 and build on the Resolution adopted at the 2022 Assembly, marking continued momentum for environmentally responsible air transport.

One of the key outcomes was the endorsement of the ICAO Global Framework for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels, and other cleaner energy sources. The framework sets a collective target of a 5% CO₂ reduction by 2030, providing a clear policy, regulatory, and financing pathway to support global SAF adoption. Member States have committed to advancing cleaner energy solutions through collaborative policy design and cross-border investment.

The Assembly emphasized the urgent need for climate investment and called for the full operationalization of the ICAO Finvest Hub. Designed to bridge the gap between decarbonization projects and financial stakeholders, the hub will play a critical role in mobilizing both public and private capital—particularly in developing countries that face significant financing constraints.

This initiative is expected to unlock access to climate finance, facilitating real-world progress in low-emission infrastructure, SAF production, and technology upgrades.

Member States reaffirmed their commitment to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which remains the world’s only global market-based emissions reduction mechanism for international flights. The Assembly confirmed that CORSIA is on track and that support will be intensified through the ACT-CORSIA programme, helping more countries implement and benefit from the scheme. Currently, 130 States are voluntarily participating in CORSIA, and the scheme’s environmental integrity was formally endorsed.

In a move that signals an expanded sustainability agenda, the Assembly advanced work on non-carbon-related environmental impacts, including aircraft noise, local air quality, single-use plastics, and non-CO₂ climate effects.

Additionally, the Assembly acknowledged the growing vulnerability of aviation infrastructure to climate-related impacts. It called for updated guidance and stronger climate risk assessment and adaptation strategies, with an emphasis on infrastructure resilience, disaster response, and emergency operations such as aerial firefighting.

The effectiveness of ICAO’s environmental efforts is demonstrated by the rising number of States submitting national Action Plans on CO₂ Emissions Reduction Activities, now reaching 154 (up from 133 in 2022).

The growing number of SAF production facilities worldwide, along with increased CORSIA participation, signals broader engagement from both States and industry in aligning with ICAO’s environmental objectives.",https://www.traveldailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ICAO-1-1200x580.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 01:56:21.852981

BloombergNEF’s Indonesia Transition Factbook aims to support policy, business and investment professionals by making available key data about the country’s energy transition, as well as the trends, challenges and opportunities that are shaping it.

Indonesia’s net-zero transformation presents a $3.8 trillion opportunity through 2050.

The country still relies heavily on fossil fuels for power generation, but it is also starting to accelerate its clean power deployment on the back of a new, renewables-rich power development plan and rapidly expanding solar and battery supply chains. Indonesia is already the world’s second-largest producer of geothermal power and is aiming for the top spot.

In the transport sector, electric vehicles are quickly gaining traction on Indonesian roads. EVs reached a 14% share of passenger vehicle sales from January to August 2025, and many foreign automakers are setting up EV production facilities in the country. Meanwhile, state-owned airlines have started commercial flights with sustainable aviation fuel made by the national oil and gas company, Pertamina.

Driven by rising fuel costs and sustainability goals, airlines are rediscovering the value of propeller-driven efficiency on short routes. Models like the De Havilland Dash 8, ATR 42, and the upcoming Deutsche Aircraft D328eco are proving that slower can sometimes mean smarter. With jets offering little advantage on 200–300-mile hops, turboprops burn far less fuel, operate from shorter runways, and cost less to maintain — a powerful equation in today’s tight-margin market.

From the US to Europe and Asia, regional carriers are returning to turboprops to connect smaller cities and remote regions. In North America, airlines like Porter and WestJet Encore use Dash 8s to serve rural hubs. Across island nations like Indonesia and the Philippines, they remain essential lifelines. The next generation, led by Germany’s D328eco, combines speed, range, and green technology — even capable of flying on 100% sustainable aviation fuel.

Once dismissed as outdated, turboprops are now being reimagined as the backbone of regional mobility — efficient, versatile, and ready for the era of low-emission flying. #fblifestyle"".",Not Available,https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/558087021_122250711842064089_5844283536119857744_n.jpg?stp=c216.0.648.648a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_tt6&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=18de74&efg=eyJlZmdfdGFnIjoiRkVFRC5iZXN0X2ltYWdlX3VybGdlbi5DMyJ9&_nc_ohc=HdBGVbh7BdYQ7kNvwEJF3fg&_nc_oc=Adl7YRCG8U56Wfp5k-Un7bSOs8udh9tpvwrnMZU7igskhfPsV2mDihGxKNMsTbC_TCw&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_gid=8Zqc2zsI-lPiRz6io4GESA&oh=00_AfdFE4OEcPkPG3A4irmdMk-FekHJBKbVGtGYlERyBxvELw&oe=68E90804,N,,2025-10-06 00:56:23.989930

Louisiana-based Diamond Green Diesel, a joint-venture between biofuel producer Darling Ingredients and petroleum refiner Valero Energy, has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into a refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, that turns cattle fat, called tallow, into a cleaner alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel and diesel.

Diamond Green Diesel is a major player in the U.S. sustainable fuel market. It has collected more than $3 billion in U.S. tax credits for producing biofues since 2022, according to filings.

Farmers urged to be grain-safe this fall

Working around grain bins comes with risk, from farmers falling to drowning in grain: Experts have five tips to help avoid grain-related accidents this harvest.

However, interviews and documents show at least two Brazilian factories that supplied Diamond Green Diesel with tens of thousands of tons of cattle fat since 2023 are sourcing some of it from slaughterhouses that have bought animals from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon rainforest.

Carriers such as JetBlue and Southwest Airlines, which struck deals with Valero to use the “green” jet fuel, can claim credit for lowering their emissions because Diamond Green Diesel’s plant is certified under a United Nations agreement curbing the impact of aviation on the climate called CORSIA.

The global market for sustainable jet fuel is small, about $2.9 billion in 2025, according to analysis firm SkyQuest Technology Group, compared to the $239 billion global market for conventional aviation fuel.

However, government incentives are expected to help the market grow exponentially, pumping more resources into the Brazilian cattle industry, which many consider the leading driver of the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

Pedro Piris-Cabezas, an economist at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said any additional demand “could result in the expansion of herds and directly or indirectly drive deforestation and forest degradation.”

It could also violate Brazilian law.

“Companies that profit from raw materials originating from a supply chain that involves deforestation are also responsible for these illegalities,” said Ricardo Negrini, a Brazilian federal prosecutor who has opened a number of government investigations into the cattle industry.

Diamond Green Diesel, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, Southwest and JetBlue did not reply to multiple requests for comment, including detailed questions about the Brazilian tallow supply chain.

To track the tallow trade from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, Reuters partnered with the nonprofit investigative outlet Reporter Brasil, which helped review court documents that link slaughterhouses to the tallow plants, corporate filings, trade data and government cattle tracking records.

Reuters also interviewed more than a dozen people involved in each step of the beef tallow supply chain, including traders, truck drivers, prosecutors, auditors and regulators.

Diamond Green Diesel sources tallow from multiple countries, and Reuters was unable to determine how much of it came from ranches in illegally cleared land in the Amazon.

In 2022, Darling Ingredients chief executive officer Randall Stuewe announced the $557 million acquisition of several plants in Brazil, including four in the Amazon region, that would supply “waste fats to be used in the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel,” according to a statement issued at the time.

Reuters found that one of those rendering plants in Para state, called Araguaia, sourced cattle fat from at least five meat packers that failed a May 2025 audit conducted by federal prosecutors for slaughtering 20,000 cattle from illegally deforested areas.

In 2023, Araguaia exported $4.4 million worth of beef tallow from the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, according to trade data from Import Genius.

In June, a Reuters journalist saw a truck with an Araguaia logo inside the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse, which failed an audit for buying cattle from farms on illegally deforested land.

The driver of the truck, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters he had been picking up carcasses at the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse and delivering them to the Araguaia plant for two years. Two other drivers and two Sao Francisco employees confirmed the slaughterhouse was an Araguaia supplier.

Sao Francisco didn’t confirm or deny that it is a supplier of the Araguaia plant. It said it has been co-operating with federal prosecutors since 2018 and that it hired an outside firm to monitor its supply chain.

Sao Francisco sources some of its cattle indirectly from Vale do Paraiso, a farm that had been blocked from grazing cattle since 2006 because 15 sq. miles of trees had been illegally razed, according to Brazil’s environmental protection agency, Ibama.

Cattle tracking data shows that the cattle were moved from Vale do Paraiso to a farm with a clean record before it reached the slaughterhouse.

The agency unblocked Vale do Paraiso last year because a court determined that the statute of limitations had expired, but its owner, Antonio Lucena Barros, still owes more than $3 million in fines for the deforestation there, according to government documents.

Barros’ lawyer, Calebe Rocha, said in a statement that his client is fighting the fines in court and has been granted an injunction that suspends the payment of the fine. He also said that no animals were sold from the part of Vale do Paraiso that Ibama had blocked due to deforestation.

Another plant owned by Darling Ingredients sourced fat from a slaughterhouse that confirmed to Reuters that it bought hundreds of cattle in 2022 and 2023 from rancher Bruno Heller, who Brazil’s Federal Police has described as possibly the Amazon’s biggest deforester in a 2023 investigation.

In a statement, Heller’s lawyer, Vinicius Segatto, said Brazil’s environmental law is “excessively rigorous” and that the criminal case against his client is ongoing.

Airlines have been under pressure to buy more green jet fuel, which is now produced in tiny quantities, to meet industry targets of net zero emissions by 2050.

Supporters of the use of tallow as a biofuel assert that demand for it alone is unlikely to push ranchers to clear rainforest to expand their pastures because of its economic value — less than three per cent of what slaughterhouses get for each animal.

Diamonds’ imports from Brazil were certified as sustainable by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), a third-party certification body that approved Diamond’s plant for CORSIA.

To be eligible, biomass used for fuel cannot come from land that was deforested after 2008 or protected areas, but the ISCC told Reuters it did not investigate Diamond’s supply chain because it considers tallow a byproduct of the beef industry under CORSIA.

Three experts who helped design CORSIA told Reuters that the program allows producers to omit the score for carbon emissions and deforestation of the Amazon rainforest because it assumes demand for tallow is unlikely to push ranchers to expand their herds.

The International Civil Aviation Organization declined to comment when asked about whether it viewed deforestation in the tallow supply chain as a violation of its sustainability standards.

However, the agency said it is “constantly monitoring the compliance” of third parties responsible for certifying sustainable aviation fuel producers and welcomes information on “any potential deviations” for further evaluation.",https://static.producer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02161144/190830_web1_2012-10-23T120000Z_974771627_GM1E8AN10Q101_RTRMADP_3_BRAZIL-SOY-CATTLE.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 22:56:12.507873

“This credibility helps counter negative campaigns in key export markets and assures buyers that Malaysian palm oil meets climate-conscious consumer demand,” he told Bernama.
Raising yield and productivity Ahmad Parveez said a 100% reinvestment allowance for oil palm replanting should be encouraged to accelerate replanting by both private and government agencies.
“This initiative is expected to increase the oil palm replanting rate from 2.5% (101,809ha) to 5.1% (210,000ha) annually,” he said.
He expressed hope that the government would approve RM280mil in funding for oil palm replanting programmes specifically for independent smallholders.","KUALA LUMPUR: The palm oil industry has called for more targeted incentives and policy support under Budget 2026 to enhance export competitiveness, boost yields and productivity, and strengthen sustainability, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB).

Its director-general, Datuk Dr Ahmad Parveez Ghulam Kadir, said the government should intensify trade promotion and branding initiatives to position Malaysian palm oil as a sustainable, climate-smart commodity.

“Stronger branding reinforces Malaysia’s commitment to sustainability standards such as Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification and the National Traceability System, which improves transparency and accountability.

“This credibility helps counter negative campaigns in key export markets and assures buyers that Malaysian palm oil meets climate-conscious consumer demand,” he told Bernama.

He said the industry is also seeking fiscal incentives for downstream products, including oleochemicals, specialty fats, bioenergy, and sustainable aviation fuel, describing them as key levers to future-proof the sector against regulatory pressures, shifting consumer preferences, and global sustainability requirements.

“We urge more strategic support for logistics efficiency, including incentives for greener and lower-cost export solutions, to address both immediate cost pressures and long-term market positioning, ensuring that Malaysia’s palm oil industry remains resilient and future-ready,” he added.

Raising yield and productivity

Ahmad Parveez said a 100% reinvestment allowance for oil palm replanting should be encouraged to accelerate replanting by both private and government agencies.

“This initiative is expected to increase the oil palm replanting rate from 2.5% (101,809ha) to 5.1% (210,000ha) annually,” he said.

He expressed hope that the government would approve RM280mil in funding for oil palm replanting programmes specifically for independent smallholders.

“Recognising the urgent need to rejuvenate ageing plantations, the government remains committed to supporting independent smallholders and will continue to fast-track the replanting programme under the 13th Malaysia Plan.

“This includes improving delivery mechanisms, facilitating access to financial assistance, and strengthening outreach and engagement with smallholder communities,” he said.

He noted that the introduction of a RM100mil soft loan scheme for small and medium oil palm estates was timely to rejuvenate ageing and unproductive trees, which currently contribute to declining yields and reduced competitiveness.

“Similar to Smallholder Oil Palm Replanting Programme, this scheme would allow smallholders to undertake replanting without heavy financial strain, thereby accelerating rejuvenation across a wider segment of the industry.

“In the medium to long term, this initiative will boost national crude palm oil production through higher-yielding palm varieties and better farm management practices,” he noted.

Promoting a sustainable future

Ahmad Parveez proposed imposing a 3% export duty on refined, bleached and deodorised palm stearin to discourage excessive exports and ensure sufficient supply for the domestic oleochemical sector.

He said maintaining an adequate domestic supply of raw materials would sustain production and competitiveness while indirectly supporting the palm-based oleochemical industry.

“By strengthening downstream industries, we create a more sustainable and resilient palm oil future, adding higher value locally and safeguarding long-term competitiveness,” he said.

He also suggested imposing a 10% to 20% export duty on waste oils, including used cooking oil and palm oil mill effluent.

This would promote local utilisation and value addition by securing sufficient feedstock for biodiesel, renewable fuels, and oleochemical production.

“Additionally, duties would help reinforce compliance with sustainability and certification standards such as MSPO and International Sustainability and Carbon Certification, which are crucial for both domestic use and export credibility.

“In the longer term, this measure would accelerate Malaysia’s transition towards a circular, greener palm oil industry and strengthen its global competitiveness as a responsible and future-ready commodity.”

Overcoming external challenges

Ahmad Parveez added that the Budget 2026 could play a pivotal role in helping the palm oil sector overcome external challenges while fostering growth, productivity and resilience.

He said replanting programmes for smallholders and small and medium enterprise plantations should be expanded, with an emphasis on high-yielding and disease-resistant planting materials.

“The focus should also be on strengthening sustainability compliance through universal MSPO adoption and robust traceability systems.

“Compliance with global environmental, social and governance standards is vital to safeguard Malaysia’s position in international markets.

“Incentives for mechanisation, digitalisation and precision agriculture would further help reduce reliance on manual labour and improve operational efficiency,” he added.",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/10/06/3556304.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 20:56:19.644707

AIS chief executive Somchai Lertsutiwong said the company plans to address climate change through efficient management of its business operations and supply chain.

Mr Somchai said the potential of digital technology and collaboration from several sectors are the keys to driving the country towards a sustainable future.

He said AIS's digital green initiative includes greener products and services, a greener supply chain and customers, a greener corporation and greener business growth.

GREEN NETWORK

The company upgraded equipment at its cellular network base stations nationwide and integrated them with clean energy, alongside conventional energy supplies.

For example, AIS recently installed solar energy systems at more than 13,000 cellular network base stations and buildings.

Mr Somchai said the move was crucial in remote areas, where 100% alternative energy is required to support communication services.

One of AIS's green initiatives is called ""Green Energy, Green Network for Thais"", delivering solar power-generated electricity to communities and installing solar-powered cellular base stations to create digital networks for communities.

AIS, Gulf Development, and the Highland Research and Development Institute (HRDI) teamed up for the project last year, seeking to improve the quality of life for Thais in highland areas.

Two pilot projects are running in the Ban Dok Mai Sod community and Moko Poke community in Tak province's Tha Song Yang district.

Mr Somchai said the goal is to reduce inequality, improve quality of life and foster sustainable economic growth within these communities.

The trio continued their partnership with the commencement of a second year of the project in June 2025.

Another project took place in Ban Doi Wiang in Chiang Mai's Chai Prakan district, where Gulf joined forces with AIS and satellite operator Thaicom to install solar panels at the Mae Fah Luang Community Learning Center.

The clean energy generated supports internet and satellite connectivity, enabling children and youth to access new knowledge and educational opportunities.

The AIS network also enhances digital access and communication for the entire community.

Furthermore, the project supported the construction of a solar-powered coffee processing facility and provided coffee milling equipment, allowing locals to add value to their produce and develop a community-owned coffee brand.

Mr Somchai said AIS leverages artificial intelligence to manage energy consumption at its base stations.

Regarding waste management, AIS focuses on reducing and recycling waste from its operations under its ""Zero E-Waste to Landfill"" goal -- meaning no electronic waste ends up in landfills.

The company also encouraged the public to properly manage e-waste, he said.

HUB OF E-WASTE

Saichon Submakudom, head of corporate communication and public affairs at AIS, said sustainability and environmental stewardship are at the heart of its operations, particularly in the area of e-waste management.

""We are committed to becoming Thailand's hub of e-waste,"" Ms Saichon said.

AIS, together with more than 250 public and private sector partners, has been raising awareness about the impact of e-waste and providing convenient disposal channels that ensure proper recycling, she said.

Since 2020, AIS's collaboration with Central Group on an e-waste project has expanded to include more than 42 e-waste drop-off points nationwide.

Every piece of e-waste deposited with AIS is handled through its partnership with Waste Management Siam (WMS), a member of Dowa Group.

According to AIS, the amount of e-waste increases every year globally. In 2024, 62 million tonnes of e-waste was generated and estimates suggest the quantity will increase to 74 million tonnes by 2030 and 110 tonnes by 2050.

Of the 62 million tonnes of e-waste produced in 2024, only 22% of it was managed properly, according to the company.

Some 439,495 tonnes of e-waste was generated in Thailand in 2024 and only 10% of it was handled properly, noted AIS.

Thailand ranks third in Southeast Asia for greatest quantity of e-waste produced.

FLY FOR FREE

AIS recently partnered with Central and Japan Airlines (JAL) to launch the ""Film Your E-Waste Drop & Fly to Japan for Free!"" campaign.

The campaign invites AIS customers, as well as eco-conscious shoppers using Central outlets, to unleash their creativity by producing short videos that inspire friends to dispose of e-waste correctly.

The winners are awarded an exclusive trip to Japan via JAL, featuring an all-inclusive dining, travelling and shopping experience. The campaign runs from now until Nov 30.

The trip includes a collaboration between AIS and Central to explore Japan's comprehensive e-waste management and recycling ecosystem at a Dowa company in Japan.

Dowa possesses a wealth of expertise in e-waste management and recycling, and is a global leader in e-waste solutions.

Achara Wisuttiwongrat, head of corporate marketing, communication and sustainability at Central, said the company set a target to reduce landfill waste by at least 30% by 2030, and achieve zero landfill waste by 2050 through its ""Love The Earth – Zero Waste Now"" project.

Takafumi Sawada, regional manager of Thailand, Indochina, and the South Asian subcontinent at JAL, said the airline is deeply committed to its environmental and social responsibilities.

He said the airline set a target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 by reducing carbon dioxide emissions and adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced from used cooking oil during flights.

JAL plans to increase the proportion of SAF it uses to 10% by 2030, while modernising its fleet with new, energy-efficient aircraft.

The airline is following the ""Reduce, Reuse, Recycle + Redesign"" principle by eliminating single-use plastics and introducing biodegradable food containers to reduce its environmental impact, said Mr Sawada.

SHIFTING GEARS

Yoshihiro Okada, president of WMS, said Dowa Group has been involved in mining and metal smelting for more than 140 years.

""We shifted our business direction to address the depletion of natural resources by turning e-waste into a valuable source of raw materials for precious metal extraction,"" he said.

In Thailand, Mr Okada said Dowa believes ""e-waste is not waste, but a valuable resource"".

Through its collaboration with AIS, the e-waste collected is sent to ESBEC, a subsidiary of WMS, for dismantling.

Most of the recyclable materials are processed domestically, while non-recyclable components such as mobile phone batteries are safely disposed of using energy recovery incineration.

For complex yet highly valuable components, such as printed circuit boards containing multiple precious metals, these are exported to Dowa's facilities in Japan for advanced recycling processes.

Mr Okada said as a global leader in resource extraction and circular utilisation, Dowa is committed to reintegrating these recovered metals back into industrial processes -- helping to build a more sustainable future for both society and the environment.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2025/10/06/5806160_700.jpeg,N,,2025-10-05 20:56:34.998147

“We are proud to collaborate with the African Development Bank in advancing Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Africa,” said Shoji Yamada, JGC’s President.
Sustainable aviation fuel represents a category of jet fuel derived from renewable sources rather than petroleum.
Sustainable aviation fuel has emerged as the most immediately viable option for reducing aviation emissions while existing aircraft continue operating.
Its involvement in sustainable aviation fuel development reflects a strategic bet that the sector offers genuine development potential rather than just environmental benefits.","Africa’s aviation industry could soon be producing its own sustainable fuel rather than relying entirely on imported jet fuel, following a new partnership between the African Development Bank (AfDB) and a major Japanese engineering company. The collaboration, announced Friday, aims to develop production capacity for sustainable aviation fuel across the continent while advancing climate goals and reducing dependence on fossil fuel imports.

The AfDB and JGC Corporation signed a Letter of Intent on August 21 in Yokohama during the Ninth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD9), establishing a framework for cooperation on green aviation projects. The timing reflects growing global momentum toward cleaner aviation fuels as airlines and governments seek ways to reduce the sector’s substantial carbon footprint.

Under the agreement, both organizations will share technical information, conduct demand assessments and feasibility studies, and explore opportunities to co finance sustainable aviation fuel projects across Africa. For the AfDB, the partnership fits within its broader sustainable transport and energy transition strategy, which increasingly targets sectors with high emissions and significant economic impact.

“Adopting Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Africa is a crucial component of the journey to cutting the continent’s carbon dioxide emissions,” said Solomon Quaynor, the bank’s Vice President for Private Sector, Infrastructure and Industrialization. “Moreover, it should boost the competitiveness of the sector over time.”

His emphasis on competitiveness highlights an economic dimension beyond environmental benefits. Airlines operating in Africa currently purchase conventional jet fuel at prices determined by global oil markets and supply chain logistics that favor established aviation hubs. Developing domestic sustainable aviation fuel production could eventually provide cost advantages while creating new industries and employment opportunities.

JGC Corporation, founded in 1928 and headquartered in Yokohama, brings substantial engineering expertise to the partnership. The company has expanded beyond traditional plant engineering into renewable energy and sustainable fuels in recent years, positioning itself to help African countries adapt technologies that have been tested in other markets to local conditions and feedstock availability.

“We are proud to collaborate with the African Development Bank in advancing Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Africa,” said Shoji Yamada, JGC’s President. “By leveraging our experience in plant engineering and sustainable energy, we aim to contribute to Africa’s decarbonization efforts while fostering local economic growth and innovation.”

The company’s role will include conducting demand assessments that determine how much sustainable aviation fuel African airlines and airports could realistically consume, performing technical feasibility studies to identify promising production locations and technologies, and exploring how Japanese sustainable aviation fuel systems might need modification to work effectively in African contexts.

The AfDB, meanwhile, will coordinate with public sector aviation stakeholders including national airlines, airport authorities, and transportation ministries. The bank plans to identify potential project pipelines, develop financing options that could make projects viable for private investors, and promote partnerships around sustainable aviation initiatives throughout its 41 African member countries.

Sustainable aviation fuel represents a category of jet fuel derived from renewable sources rather than petroleum. Common feedstocks include plant oils, agricultural waste materials, municipal solid waste, and even carbon captured from industrial processes. When produced and used properly, these fuels can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel, according to industry assessments.

The fuel isn’t entirely new. Airlines globally have been testing and using sustainable aviation fuel in limited quantities for years, often blending small percentages with conventional fuel. What’s changing is the scale of production and adoption as governments implement climate policies and airlines respond to pressure from customers and investors to reduce emissions.

For Africa, entering the sustainable aviation fuel market presents both opportunities and challenges. The continent has abundant agricultural resources and waste streams that could serve as feedstock for fuel production. Many African countries also have significant solar energy potential that could power production facilities, creating genuinely low carbon fuel production chains.

However, building sustainable aviation fuel production capacity requires substantial upfront investment in specialized facilities and supply chain infrastructure. The technology, while proven, remains more expensive than conventional refining in most contexts. And African countries would need to develop regulatory frameworks governing fuel quality standards, sustainability certifications, and integration with existing aviation fuel supply systems.

The partnership announcement comes as global aviation confronts its climate impact. The sector accounts for roughly 2 to 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, a share that’s been growing as air travel expands faster than efficiency improvements can offset. Unlike some industries where electrification offers a clear pathway to decarbonization, aviation faces significant technical hurdles in moving away from liquid fuels, particularly for long haul flights.

Sustainable aviation fuel has emerged as the most immediately viable option for reducing aviation emissions while existing aircraft continue operating. The fuel works in current engines without modification, unlike hydrogen or battery electric propulsion systems that would require entirely new aircraft designs.

For African nations, the economic calculus around sustainable aviation fuel development includes multiple factors beyond direct production costs. Countries currently spend significant foreign exchange importing jet fuel. Domestic production could improve trade balances while creating skilled manufacturing jobs. The agricultural and waste management sectors might find new revenue streams by supplying feedstock to fuel producers.

There’s also a competitive dimension. If sustainable aviation fuel production scales up in other regions while Africa remains dependent on imports, African airlines could face cost disadvantages as carbon pricing mechanisms and sustainability requirements proliferate. Developing domestic capacity now could position the continent advantageously for future market conditions.

The AfDB has been actively financing infrastructure and industrial projects across Africa, operating as the continent’s premier development finance institution with support for initiatives in 54 regional member states. Its involvement in sustainable aviation fuel development reflects a strategic bet that the sector offers genuine development potential rather than just environmental benefits.

Whether this partnership generates significant on the ground projects remains to be seen. Memoranda of understanding and letters of intent are common in development finance, sometimes leading to substantial initiatives but other times failing to advance beyond preliminary studies. Success will likely depend on identifying specific countries with favorable conditions for initial projects, securing adequate financing, and navigating regulatory complexities.

What’s clear is that both organizations see opportunity in Africa’s potential role in the emerging sustainable aviation fuel industry. As Quaynor suggested, the partnership could “unlock new opportunities for green aviation and position Africa as a pacesetter in the sector.” Whether that optimistic vision materializes will depend on execution in the months and years ahead, but the framework for collaboration is now established.",https://b843437.smushcdn.com/843437/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/logo-newsghana.png?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1,N,,2025-10-05 18:56:12.329894

The African Development Bank (AfDB) and Japan’s JGC Corporation have signed a Letter of Intent to collaborate on developing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects across Africa — a move that could help accelerate the continent’s transition toward greener air transport.

The agreement was signed on the sidelines of the Ninth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD9) held in Yokohama last month, by Solomon Quaynor, AfDB Vice President for Private Sector, Infrastructure and Industrialization, and Shoji Yamada, Representative Director and President of JGC Corporation.

SAF refers to jet fuel produced from renewable resources such as plant oils, waste materials, or captured carbon, which can significantly reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

The Letter of Intent establishes a framework for joint promotion, knowledge exchange, and co-financing opportunities in the development of SAF and other green aviation initiatives on the continent.

As part of the agreement, the AfDB will facilitate coordination with public-sector aviation stakeholders, identify potential project pipelines, and explore financing mechanisms — including feasibility study support and debt or equity financing.

Meanwhile, JGC Corporation will conduct demand and technical feasibility studies, assess deployment opportunities based on local infrastructure and resources, and help transfer Japanese clean-energy technology to African markets.

The initiative aligns with the AfDB’s sustainable transport, mobility, and energy transition strategy, aimed at decarbonizing key sectors of Africa’s economy while supporting industrial growth and innovation.

Quaynor said the partnership represents an important step toward reducing emissions and enhancing competitiveness in Africa’s aviation sector.

“Adopting sustainable aviation fuel in Africa is a crucial component of the journey to cutting the continent’s carbon dioxide emissions,” he said.

“Moreover, it should boost the competitiveness of the sector over time. This partnership with JGC will help unlock new opportunities for green aviation and position Africa as a pacesetter in the sector.”

JGC’s president, Shoji Yamada, said the company is eager to apply its engineering expertise to Africa’s decarbonization efforts.

“We are proud to collaborate with the African Development Bank in advancing sustainable aviation fuel in Africa,” Yamada said.

“By leveraging our experience in plant engineering and sustainable energy, we aim to contribute to Africa’s decarbonization efforts while fostering local economic growth and innovation.”

If successful, the partnership could mark a milestone in Africa’s clean-energy transition, positioning the continent to play a leading role in the global sustainable aviation market, expected to grow exponentially over the next decade.

Countries use a wide variety of financial management systems and processes, which are not standardized and seldom share information across platforms.

To address these issues, the World Bank is rolling out FundsChain.

This proprietary platform uses blockchain technology to track every dollar on a secure, immutable digital ledger that can be accessed by all project stakeholders.

By offering broader access to up-to-date transaction records, FundsChain is greatly enhancing efficiency, transparency, and accountability.

As the first multilateral development institution to implement blockchain for project oversight, the World Bank is leading the way in future-ready financial management.

Impact on financial management and communities

The use of FundsChain to track project funds is part of a broader effort to make World Bank Group (WBG) operations more efficient and streamlined, ultimately better serving clients and communities.

“FundsChain is a one-stop shop for financial reporting and transparent tracking. It quickly shows payments, contracts, and expenses, notifying suppliers the moment payments are ready, empowering teams to make timely, informed decisions and streamline project management,” said Lovella Tolentino-Morada, finance management specialist at the Metro Manila Development Authority.

The Philippines was one of the early adopters of FundsChain, which was rolled out to the Metro Manila Flood Management Project, a USD 500 million initiative funded by the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

The project aims to reduce Manila’s vulnerability to floods by upgrading water infrastructure.

In Bangladesh, FundsChain is being used in the Bangladesh Resilience, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood Improvement Project.

This initiative targets 3,200 villages to help women launch entrepreneurial ventures, cover pregnancy-related expenses, improve sanitation, and provide wider support for the community.

Since the project worth USD 600 million began in 2021, it has helped lift more than 115,000 people out of poverty.

“We are implementing FundsChain in 350 villages as a pilot. We are also implementing our Loan Management System (LMS) in all 3,200 villages of the project, providing laptops, and women leaders have been trained to use it.

When FundsChain is linked with the LMS, they will be able to use it directly, and every village organization will become part of the process and can track funds transparently,” explained Mahbubul Alam, director of the project at the Social Development Foundation, an autonomous organization under the Financial Institutions Division of the Ministry of Finance.

Alam underscored that FundsChain is also benefiting his finance management team by simplifying transaction records and digitalizing all project-related information, something especially important in a project with many suppliers and beneficiaries.

FundsChain is a one-stop shop for financial reporting and transparent tracking.

It quickly shows payments, contracts, and expenses, notifying suppliers the moment payments are ready, empowering teams to make timely, informed decisions and streamline project management.

How does FundsChain work?

FundsChain integrates technologies such as cryptography, distributed ledgers, and the internet to provide a secure and immutable platform for all types of transactions.

It uses Hyperledger Besu, a blockchain solution which allows transactions to be stored by all parties involved in a project and recorded permanently.

This enables development partners to track funds throughout the lifecycle of a project, and to prepare comprehensive project execution reports, allowing for robust data analysis.

The platform has already been recognized internationally.

In 2025, it received the Most Exciting Public Sector Innovation Project award from the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications and was featured in Citi’s Global Perspective and Solutions report for its role in modernizing financial systems and enabling new financial instruments.

FundsChain has been successfully tested in 13 projects across 10 countries, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Comoros Islands, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Moldova, Mozambique, and the Philippines.

It will now be scaled up and extended to approximately 250 projects in developing countries by the end of this fiscal year, in June 2026.

As FundsChain continues to expand across more projects and countries, it is important to ensure that development financing is fast and transparent, to deliver the best outcomes for people and the planet.",https://tanzaniatimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FundsChain-village.webp,N,,2025-10-05 17:56:15.893777

With the right investments and partnerships, Africa’s youth can climb the ladder of opportunity—and drive the continent toward a brighter future.","By Christian Bodewig, Camilla Holmemo, Suleiman Namara and Robert S. Chase

Sub-Saharan Africa is undergoing a demographic transition of global proportion.

By 2050, the region’s population is set to grow from 1.5 billion in 2024 to 2.5 billion, with more than 600 million people joining the working-age population.

By then, one in three individuals aged 15-34 globally will be African.

This provides an enormous opportunity for the continent to reap the demographic dividend of higher economic growth propelled by an expanding population.

That is, however, only if this expanding population can find productive employment opportunities. Jobs are the pathway to prosperity.

And yet, this is the crux: while Sub-Saharan Africa needs to create 15 million jobs each year to keep up, its economies create far fewer and are often poorly remunerated.

Today, many youths are idle, nor in education, employment, or training (NEET).

Adolescent girls specifically are too often dropping out of school due to early marriage or childbearing. There is real urgency.

World Bank Group President Ajay Banga has called for building “a ladder of opportunity” for young people in developing countries, where each rung represents a step towards better jobs and greater empowerment.

This is an appealing people-focused framework to think through what it takes to boost job opportunities at scale and quickly.

It recognizes that the path to inclusive growth in Africa lies in the generation of higher-quality jobs, with higher labour earnings being the main driver of poverty reduction.

Solving this challenge in Africa requires a multi-pronged strategy, from increased wage employment in today’s often small formal private sector to increased productivity in self-employment and micro-enterprises in Africa’s vast informal sector.

Managed migration programs can also enhance productive labour mobility within countries and internationally, including towards fast-aging economies.

Onto the ladder and up…

For young people to climb the ladder of opportunity, they must first get on it.

Extreme poverty and food insecurity often prevent this initial step.

Across Africa, social protection programs have proven effective in helping the poor onto the ladder by ensuring that food is on the table, children can access education and health services – key for building a strong workforce for tomorrow – and households can invest in productive assets like livestock or street vending.

Social protection also offers a safety net to those who fall off the ladder in the face of shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic or increasingly severe and frequent climate events.

Over the past two decades, Africa has pioneered “productive” social protection programs, starting with the flagship Ethiopia Productive Safety Net.

These initiatives now go beyond income support, incorporating public works employment that promote climate mitigation and resilience, engaging beneficiaries in entrepreneurship and life skills training, opening bank accounts, and promoting group savings schemes in addition to income support.

Programs like Senegal’s urban Yokk Koom Koom program, Ghana’s Productive Safety Net Program, and Zambia’s Supporting Women’s Livelihoods program, have significantly boosted household revenues and savings.

These programs are particularly successful among women who often self-select as the entrepreneurial dynamo in the household.

Youth employment programs are expanding to support African Youth in finding meaningful work. For example, Kenya’s Youth Employment and Opportunities program (KYEOP) has helped 155,000 young people launch 86,000 businesses, create 125,000 jobs, and increase incomes by 50 percent.

Building on this success, Kenya’s new National Youth Opportunities Towards Advancement (NYOTA) aims to reach 800,000 youth, addressing 35 percent of inactive, unemployed, or low paid young people aged 18-29.

Benin’s Azôli program (which means “path to employment”) similarly supports youth with job training, placement services, and entrepreneurship support.

These programs demonstrate that scaling such efforts can significantly impact youth employment, creating pathways to economic inclusion and resilience.

…and scaling the ladder

For the ladder of opportunity to support millions of aspiring workers, governments need to invest in robust systems.

Digital social registries of poor and vulnerable households, underpinned by identification systems, are the platform for targeting support to those most in need.

Digital government-to-person (G2P) payment systems can be used to transfer income support or start-up grants to beneficiaries and serve as an entry to access finance.

Labor market systems are critical to allow programs to scale. Senegal is building a system of informal apprenticeships with a formal validation of acquired competencies, delivering credentials to youth trained by informal businesses.

Benin’s national employment agency plays a key role in matching young job seekers to employment opportunities in the expanding private sector such as textiles in the Glo-Djigbé Industrial Zone.

Realizing Africa’s demographic dividend by 2050 requires dynamic private sector development to create productive jobs.

For the private sector to invest and create jobs, reforms need to be prioritized to enhance the business environment, boost market access, attract investment, and improve trade as well as sector and firm performance.

At the same time, education and skills development systems must prepare the workforce for the demands of a growing formal private sector.

While some of these reforms will take time to deliver results, scaling youth employment programs can deliver immediate results, helping millions onto the ladder of opportunity.

The urgency is real, but so is the opportunity.

The author is director of research at the Institute of Innovative and High-Quality Development (Hong Kong).","Hong Kong’s 2025 Policy Address lays out an ambitious green agenda to drive economic revitalization and sustainability hand in hand, embracing cleaner energy, modern transport, waste reduction, and nature-based tourism as engines for growth. It aligns with broader strategies — from the Northern Metropolis innovation hub to expansion of the headquarters economy — ensuring Hong Kong’s prosperity ties to environmental leadership.

Hong Kong is upgrading its infrastructure to improve efficiency and cut emissions. Building retrofits (better insulation, smart systems, on-site renewables) and district cooling projects will sharply reduce energy use in older commercial buildings. These measures also create new jobs — architects, engineers and green-product makers — bolstering the economy. The plans tie into the Northern Metropolis development strategy.

To power these advances, the city is expanding its clean energy infrastructure. A landmark commitment is the construction of an electric-vehicle battery recycling facility — the city’s first large-scale plant — which will start operation in the first half of 2026. Retired EV batteries will be broken down into “black mass” for reuse in new batteries, creating a circular supply chain. This not only reduces waste but also supplies materials to the Chinese mainland and the broader region, reinforcing Hong Kong’s role in a regional green economy. Fast charging for EVs is also being accelerated — a HK$300 million ($38.5 million) incentive program will add about 3,000 fast chargers by 2028, and bus depots will open chargers to public use. Together, these steps lower barriers for drivers to switch to EVs and cut transport emissions.

At the same time, the city is fostering innovation. The government continues funding emerging clean technologies through grants and partnerships. This includes the new HK$3 billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme, and an upcoming HK$1 billion artificial intelligence research institute, illustrating how the green and tech agendas reinforce each other.

Transportation is a major emission source, so Hong Kong is pushing aggressively to electrify vehicles. In addition to expanding charging networks, the government will support market development of battery-swapping technologies and automated swapping stations. In fact, taxi and bus operators are already deploying EV fleets under government programs.

Hong Kong’s leadership is tying sustainable development to economic revitalization, headquarters attraction, and regional integration. The overall tone is one of confidence: By blending ambition with realism, the city aims to become a model “green finance and innovation hub” for Asia

Hong Kong is advancing toward a “zero landfill” future, with the Waste Blueprint 2035 targeting adequate waste-to-resource capacity by the mid-2030s; I-Park1 will progressively begin operation by end-2025, with I-Park2 funding sought next year, and a paper-pulping facility to begin trial operation by the end of 2025.

Hydrogen energy is a centerpiece of Hong Kong’s decarbonization strategy. The city has already launched 28 hydrogen trial projects — from zero-emission buses and street scrubbers to a public hydrogen refueling station in the New Territories — under the Hydrogen Strategy announced last year. These pilots, in collaboration with Guangdong province, aim to make fuel-cell vehicles practical and prepare the way for industrial use. In 2025, authorities will set safety and quality standards for hydrogen fuel and extend refilling stations to Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. A notable goal is developing a Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Hydrogen Corridor — a cross-border network of production plants and pipelines linking Hong Kong with mainland facilities, which will enable Hong Kong to tap cheaper large-scale hydrogen from neighboring cities, while providing outlets for local innovations.

Alongside hydrogen, Hong Kong is pursuing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for air transport and a specified target SAF consumption ratio by 2030 for flights departing Hong Kong. This means large volumes of biofuels or synthetic kerosene will replace traditional jet fuel. To support this, the city will partner with mainland SAF producers to build local SAF plants and a blending terminal, creating a Greater Bay Area hub for green aviation fuel. This positions Hong Kong air travel on a low-carbon path.

HK as a green finance hub

Hong Kong’s financial sector is a core pillar of this green strategy. The city has already cemented itself as Asia’s leading sustainable finance hub. To guide markets, Hong Kong has developed a local green taxonomy, released in 2024, aligned with the mainland’s, the European Union’s, and global standards. This common framework helps investors identify bona fide “green” projects and avoid “greenwashing”. Regulators are also building carbon-market infrastructure. For instance, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd’s “Core Climate” carbon exchange is set to trial cross-boundary trading with Guangdong province pilot markets. Such links allow companies in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area to trade carbon credits seamlessly, broadening the market and depth of financing for clean projects. Together, these steps strengthen the city’s specialty as the gateway for green capital — attracting international issuers and funding while circulating private investment into local green jobs.

Hong Kong’s green push extends well beyond its borders, embracing the Greater Bay Area. The strategy explicitly builds on regional synergies. A centerpiece is the Beautiful Bay Area initiative — Hong Kong will co-lead efforts with Guangdong to clean up and protect coastal waters and ecosystems. It has pledged coordinated action on nearshore pollution control, shoreline restoration and ecosystem monitoring.

Energy and industrial cooperation also figure prominently. The planned Greater Bay Area Hydrogen Corridor is a joint effort: Guangdong’s large hydrogen-production facilities will link to Hong Kong’s end users, creating economies of scale. In aviation and shipping, Hong Kong aims to be the regional green-fuel trading hub, exporting SAF and promoting clean marine fuels throughout the bay. Financially, Hong Kong is deepening carbon and bond market integration. The upcoming Hong Kong-Shenzhen Stock Connect extensions and carbon-trading pilot programs will let businesses tap the combined Greater Bay Area capital pool for climate projects. Even in waste, the new EV battery recycling plant in Hong Kong will feed raw materials into mainland factories, and vice versa. In short, the policy envisions Hong Kong’s climate efforts as fully embedded in the Greater Bay Area ecosystem.

Hong Kong’s status as an international port and tourist destination is being leveraged for sustainability. Maritime services will go green: A new government Bunkering Incentive Scheme and budgetary tax breaks encourage early adoption of zero-carbon fuels like green methanol and liquefied natural gas. The 2025-26 Budget explicitly offers tax incentives for ships bunkering green methanol, to cut costs and make Hong Kong a leader in sustainable shipping. Marine Department action plans will build green fuel terminals and safety protocols. These moves will attract eco-conscious shipping lines and spur local investment (fuel logistics, vessel refits) — reinforcing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as a maritime hub while reducing pollutants in its harbor.

On land, nature and tourism are being integrated under an “Ecology + Tourism” banner. The Four Peaks project will upgrade trails and facilities on Hong Kong’s mountains, adding things like treetop adventure parks, open-air cultural museums, and campsite renewals, all built to blend into the landscape. Meanwhile, rural attractions are being linked into immersive eco-tours: A network of cycling and hiking routes will connect traditional villages, ancestral halls, farms and cultural sites, providing rural communities with new income while encouraging city dwellers to appreciate conservation. The 2025 Policy Address sets out clear timelines. Hong Kong’s leadership is tying sustainable development to economic revitalization, headquarters attraction, and regional integration. The overall tone is one of confidence: By blending ambition with realism, the city aims to become a model “green finance and innovation hub” for Asia.

The proposed legislation aims to establish a comprehensive legal and institutional framework that supports artists, filmmakers, musicians, designers, and other creative professionals, addressing long-standing challenges that have hindered the sector’s growth.

Bill to Create Fund and Institutional Support

The Creative Economy Support Bill, sponsored by Senator Eddy Oketch, proposes the establishment of a Creatives Fund that will provide grants and financial assistance to individuals and organisations in the creative industries. The Fund will be financed through parliamentary appropriations and other sources approved by the Cabinet Secretary responsible for the creative economy.

The Bill also introduces a credit guarantee scheme designed to facilitate easier access to financing for creatives from banks and financial institutions. Many artists and creative entrepreneurs in Kenya struggle to obtain loans due to the informal nature of their work and the lack of collateral. The proposed guarantee scheme aims to bridge that gap by offering risk coverage to lenders who support creative ventures.

Another key feature of the Bill is the creation of a Creative Industry Guild, which will serve as a professional body to represent the interests of creatives, promote ethical standards, and protect intellectual property rights. The Guild is expected to unify a sector that has long been fragmented, with artists operating in isolation and often without legal or institutional protection.

Empowering Youth and Building Capacity

The Bill places strong emphasis on youth empowerment, recognising that a large proportion of Kenya’s creative workforce comprises young people. It proposes targeted initiatives to provide training, mentorship, and access to infrastructure such as creative hubs and studios. These measures are intended to enhance creative skills, promote innovation, and position Kenya as a regional leader in the creative economy.

In addition, the Bill outlines programmes for capacity building and incubation to help creatives turn their talents into sustainable businesses. It also calls for improved digital infrastructure and support for creative exports, ensuring that Kenyan content can reach international markets and attract global audiences.

What the Bill Aims to Address

Kenya’s creative economy has faced multiple challenges for years, including limited access to financing, a lack of structured policy support, weak intellectual property protection, and poor market access. Many creatives work informally and earn unstable incomes, while others lose revenue due to piracy and unfair contractual arrangements.

The Creative Economy Support Bill aims to address these systemic problems by formalising the sector and establishing a clear regulatory framework. It aims to ensure that creatives are recognised as contributors to national development, with access to funding, training, and legal protection. By addressing these gaps, the Bill also supports the government’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda, which prioritises job creation and inclusive economic growth.

Debate Over “Money Bill” Status

The Bill’s introduction in the National Assembly has sparked debate over whether it qualifies as a Money Bill under Article 114 of the Constitution. While the drafters have stated that it does not, some legislators have questioned this classification because it involves the establishment of public funds. The Speaker of the National Assembly has since directed the Finance and National Planning Committee to review and advise on the matter before debate proceeds.

Significance for Kenya’s Creative Sector

If enacted, the Bill would mark a turning point for Kenya’s creative economy, which contributes significantly to employment and cultural identity but remains underfunded and undervalued. The sector includes a wide range of industries, from film and fashion to gaming, visual arts, publishing, advertising, and music.

By providing legal recognition and structured financial support, the proposed law is expected to boost investor confidence, improve working conditions for creatives, and position Kenya as a continental hub for creative innovation.

Public Participation

The Creative Economy Support Bill will now undergo committee scrutiny, public participation, and several readings before it can be passed into law. Stakeholders from across the arts and entertainment industry are closely watching its progress, with many expressing optimism that the legislation will finally bring long-awaited reforms.

If implemented effectively, the Bill could unlock Kenya’s creative potential, empower thousands of young artists, and transform the sector into a major driver of economic growth and cultural export.",https://newstrends.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WhatsApp-Image-2025-10-02-at-14.38.24-1024x683.jpeg,N,,2025-10-05 14:56:58.292292

In Yokohama, Japan, the Bank signed a Letter of Intent with JGC Corporation, a leading Japanese engineering company, to advance the production and adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on the continent. The agreement was concluded on the sidelines of the Ninth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD9) in August.

Under the framework, AfDB Vice President for Private Sector, Infrastructure and Industrialization, Solomon Quaynor, and JGC President, Shoji Yamada, agreed to collaborate on feasibility studies, technology transfer and potential co-financing of SAF projects across Africa. The Bank will coordinate with public sector aviation stakeholders, identify project pipelines and explore financing, while JGC will focus on technical assessments, demand studies and deployment of Japanese engineering solutions.

Quaynor described SAF as “a crucial component of the journey to cutting the continent’s carbon dioxide emissions” and stressed that the initiative could make Africa a pacesetter in green aviation. Yamada added that JGC’s involvement would leverage its expertise in plant engineering and sustainable energy to support Africa’s decarbonisation while stimulating economic growth.

In a separate deal, the AfDB Group signed a $144.7 million financing agreement with Niger to expand electricity access and strengthen economic resilience. The pact, signed in Abidjan between AfDB President Sidi Ould Tah and Nigerien Prime Minister Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine, will provide budgetary support through the Bank’s concessional lending arm, the African Development Fund.

The funds will finance Phase 1 of Niger’s Energy Sector Governance and Competitiveness Support Programme (PAGSEC), which aims to raise electricity access from 22.5 percent to 30 percent by 2026, increase manufacturing’s contribution to GDP, and deliver 240 MW of new solar capacity by 2030.

The programme also targets structural reforms, including stronger fiscal management, domestic arrears clearance, and policies to stimulate private-sector investment. It prioritises social inclusion, with tailored interventions for women, youth, and Niger’s more than 500,000 internally displaced people affected by insecurity in the Sahel.

“This agreement is part of our strong cooperation with the African Development Bank Group,” Prime Minister Zeine said, noting that the support would boost Niger’s competitiveness and resilience.

Ould Tah assured that the Bank would remain a strong partner to its member states in “their pursuit of harmonious development and shared prosperity.”

Together, the two initiatives underscore AfDB’s growing focus on clean energy, industrial competitiveness, and inclusive growth, as African economies seek to align development with climate and social imperatives.",https://hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Compress_20250723_081633_3536.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 12:56:22.213960

“The Prime Minister will first visit the terminal building, take a round of the premises, and then address the audience,” he said.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has assigned the airport the code ‘NMI’.

Domestic airlines, including the Air India Group, IndiGo, and Akasa Air, have already announced plans to shift part of their flight operations to the new facility.

Spread over 1,160 hectares, the airport will eventually house four terminals with a total passenger capacity of 90 million per year and cargo handling capacity of 3.25 million metric tonnes, positioning it among Asia’s largest aviation hubs.

“To begin with, we have completed Terminal One, with a capacity of 20 million passengers per annum, 0.8 million metric tonnes of cargo capacity, and one runway,” Singhal said.

“So, once this airport is fully completed, these two airports together will cater to almost 150 million passengers per annum, making the region a major aviation hub globally,” Singhal added.

While ₹19,647 crore has been spent on the first phase, the total project cost is expected to reach ₹1 lakh crore upon completion of all four terminals.

NMIA will also be India’s first airport to be seamlessly connected by expressways, highways, metro lines, suburban rail, and water taxi services.

A Lei do Combustível do Futuro, sancionada pelo governo federal em outubro do ano passado, estabelece que as companhias aéreas devem começar a operar com SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) a partir de 2027. As metas incluem uma redução gradual das emissões de gases de efeito estufa, começando com 1% até 2027 e alcançando 10% até 2037, com o objetivo principal de descarbonizar as operações.

Mas, além de tornar o transporte aéreo mais sustentável, a necessidade de ter plantas de produção do novo combustível próximas aos aeroportos pode trazer “janelas de oportunidades” e “grande desenvolvimento econômico” para todo o entorno. A visão otimista foi compartilhada pelos participantes do painel “O desafio de conciliar crescimento e sustentabilidade na modernização de portos e aeroportos”, apresentado no Fórum Norte Export, em Belém (PA), no último dia 25.

“O SAF traz oportunidades muito boas para o desenvolvimento econômico do país, especialmente para as regiões que vão abrigar as plantas produtoras do combustível. Até porque não faz sentido pegar o SAF produzido em Guarulhos para colocar em caminhões e trazer até Belém. Então é mandatório você ter as contratações do SAF próximas à sua matriz de consumo”, avaliou Arthur Thiago Costa, Diretor Administrativo, Financeiro e Comercial da NOA Airports, concessionária do aeroporto de Belém.

Thairyne Oliveira, secretária-executiva adjunta do Ministério dos Portos e Aeroportos, explicou que a pasta trabalha em diversas frentes para regulamentar o SAF, entre elas, a viabilização da certificação de qualidade do produto, pesquisa e desenvolvimento e políticas de incentivo e financiamento.

Em agosto do ano passado, o governo lançou um edital para financiar investimentos em plantas de SAF. Foram disponibilizados R$ 6 bilhões em recursos do Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (BNDES) e da Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (Finep), divididos em R$ 3 bi para cada. O intuito foi selecionar planos de negócios voltados à implantação de biorrefinarias no país.

The league involved six youth soccer teams and ran for four consecutive months, with matches taking place at Baraa Primary School grounds and Young Boys Venue.

Among the participating teams include the Peace Academy, CTIDO Academy, Usa Youth Academy, Black Eagle Academy, Satino and Young Boys.

However, the Black Eagle was compelled to drop out of the league midway, due to some controversies related to the ages of the participants.

The Satino Academy Coach, Abdulbast Siraji who teaches the Under-11 and Under-9 teams, said they have learned a lot during the league, especially the issue of taking seriously the ages of children who take part in the competitions.

The Young Boys Academy Coach, Jackson Tunda whose team emerged victorious stated that their mission was not just to win the trophy but to experience performance improvement among players.

“But cheating is rampant among many teams comprising young players, it therefore calls for proper awareness raising training on grassroots regarding the rules, regulations and requirements of youth leagues,” stated Tunda.

Young boys academy did not lose any match throughout the league and managed to rake in a total of 28 points.

Commenting on the league, the Chairperson of the Arumeru District Football Association (ADFA), Siza Masaka who graced the final match said the youth soccer events are the current trend globally.

“But it goes further than that here in Tanzania, where we use youth soccer leagues to identify, cultivate and produce future international players,” said Masaka.

According to the ADFA chairperson, it was high time all districts, and regions started grooming young sports personalities right from the grassroots.

“Even the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) recognizes youthful football events and we support the Young Boys Academy for the initiative of running annual leagues for the youth,” added Masaka.

Le SAF, en tant que substitut prometteur aux carburants fossiles traditionnels, pourrait bien être la clé d’une aviation plus respectueuse de notre planète.

Le SAF : un carburant révolutionnaire

Le SAF, ou carburant d’aviation durable, est un produit issu principalement de déchets organiques. Il se compose d’huiles de cuisson usagées et de graisses animales, transformées par un procédé appelé HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids). À ce mélange, s’ajoute environ 10 % de kérosène aromatique synthétique provenant de sucres végétaux. Ce carburant innovant est conçu pour être compatible avec les moteurs et infrastructures existants, ce qui facilite son intégration dans l’industrie. Virgin Atlantic met en avant l’importance du SAF pour atteindre l’objectif de zéro émission nette de carbone d’ici 2050.

Les traînées de condensation : un défi majeur

Le vol de Virgin Atlantic a servi aussi à explorer un autre aspect environnemental crucial : les traînées de condensation. Ces traînées, bien visibles derrière les avions, jouent un rôle important dans le réchauffement climatique. Selon certaines études, elles seraient responsables de 57 % de l'impact climatique de l'aviation entre 2000 et 2018, dépassant les émissions de CO2 des carburants. Le Rocky Mountain Institute, avec ses partenaires, travaille à réduire cet impact. Les données recueillies lors de ce vol sont partagées avec l'industrie aéronautique pour développer des stratégies et des technologies visant à atténuer les effets de ces traînées.

Despite global economic instability and intensifying competition, Tunisia’s textile and clothing industry has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth, securing its place as one of the European Union’s key apparel suppliers.

The sector comprises approximately 1,880 companies, with a striking 90% dedicated exclusively to exports. Foreign investment plays a significant role in this ecosystem—45% of these firms operate as joint ventures with international partners. As a cornerstone of the Tunisian economy, the textile and clothing industry accounts for around 20% of national exports and provides employment for about 176,000 workers, representing over 30% of the country’s manufacturing labor force.

In a recent statement on Mosaïque FM, Haythem Bouajila, President of the Tunisian Federation of Textile and Clothing, revealed that the industry’s exports have surpassed six billion Tunisian dinars. This performance, he noted, remains consistent with previous years, where annual exports ranged from 9 to 9.6 billion dinars, despite adverse global conditions and the rising competitiveness of regional players like Egypt, which is investing heavily in the denim and jeans market.

Bouajila emphasized that Tunisian textile products are moving upmarket, focusing on quality and innovation. This strategic pivot towards higher-end offerings has helped domestic producers withstand price-based competition from other countries where prices are falling but margins are shrinking.

Official trade statistics underscore this progress. Between 2019 and 2023, Tunisia’s textile exports to the EU rose significantly—from €1.966 billion in 2019 to €2.280 billion in 2022, and €2.358 billion in 2023—even as the EU’s overall textile imports fell by 16.22%.

In 2023 alone:

Clothing exports grew by 6.8%, totaling TND 8.18 billion

Textile exports increased by 3.07%

The total sector exports rose by 5.61%, reaching nearly TND 9.7 billion

The sectoral trade balance improved by 12.5 percentage points

Tunisia now ranks as the 10th largest supplier of clothing to the EU, ahead of major global producers such as the United Kingdom, Sri Lanka, and Egypt. This is a significant achievement, positioning the country as a key player in the European fashion and apparel supply chain.

However, the sector faces persistent structural challenges. Skilled labor shortages, logistical inefficiencies, rampant smuggling, and the expanding parallel market continue to place pressure on domestic manufacturers.

To further solidify its international competitiveness, Tunisia has launched an ambitious sustainability roadmap. By 2030, the country aims to:

Recycle 90% of wastewater used in textile production

Reduce the sector’s carbon footprint by 30%

These eco-friendly initiatives not only align with global sustainability trends but also enhance Tunisia’s appeal to environmentally conscious European partners and brands.

Mas o potencial não para aí. Subprodutos da própria usina, como a vinhaça e o CO2, quando combinados a processos que geram hidrogênio e oxigênio, abrem caminho para novos combustíveis e insumos estratégicos.

O hidrogênio renovável, por exemplo, pode ser usado em células a combustível — dispositivos que geram eletricidade a partir de reações químicas, sem poluir — ou servir de base para a amônia verde, essencial na produção de fertilizantes e vista como o futuro combustível para o transporte marítimo.

""Diferentemente do petróleo, que é um recurso finito e concentrado em poucos países, a cana é renovável, distribuída e já conta com uma cadeia produtiva consolidada no Brasil"" diz Thiago Lopes. ""Por isso, com os avanços tecnológicos, a cana deixa de ser apenas fonte de etanol e açúcar, tornando-se a base de uma nova indústria química verde, capaz de sustentar em escala setores hoje totalmente dependentes do petróleo"", completa.

Empresas já apostam na cana

Algumas empresas brasileiras já têm apostado na cana-de-açúcar como uma alternativa mais sustentável de matéria-prima. Desde 2016, o Grupo Boticário adotou o polietileno verde — plástico vegetal obtido da planta da cana — em suas embalagens.

""O plástico vegetal usado nas embalagens é fabricado por empresas que produzem polietileno a partir do etanol de cana (soluções bio-based), como a Braskem"", explica Gustavo Dieamant, diretor executivo de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento do Grupo Boticário. Hoje, há mais de 2 mil produtos no portfólio da empresa que utilizam plástico verde.

O grupo passou também a aproveitar resíduos da cana (como o bagaço) como matéria-prima para o EcoÁlcool, usado na produção de perfumes. ""Somente com isso, a partir de 2021, deixamos de emitir mais de 127 mil toneladas de gases de efeito estufa. Para dimensionar o impacto, essa redução é equivalente à captura de carbono realizada por uma área de plantio de eucaliptos do tamanho de 4.700 campos de futebol"", destaca Dieamant.

Parceira do Boticário com o EcoÁlcool, a Raízen tem investido na produção de biocombustíveis derivados da cana, como o E2G (etanol de segunda geração). Diferentemente do E1G (etanol de primeira geração), que utiliza a sacarose extraída do caldo da cana, o E2G aproveita o que antes seria descartado, tornando-se uma opção mais sustentável, com menor pegada de carbono e sem a necessidade de ampliar a área de plantio.

Em 2024, a Raízen inaugurou uma nova unidade de E2G, no Parque de Bioenergia Bonfim, em Guariba (SP). Com uma pegada de carbono 80% menor que a gasolina comum brasileira e 30% menor que o E1G, o etanol de segunda geração produzido pela empresa representa uma inovação tecnológica significativa no setor de bioenergia, pois aumenta em 50% a produção sem precisar de um hectare a mais de cana.

Biocombustíveis

Entre os diversos setores que podem se beneficiar da adoção da cana-de-açúcar como matéria-prima renovável, o de transportes se destaca como um dos mais promissores.

Atualmente, além do E2G, usinas brasileiras de cana já produzem o etanol combustível (hidratado e anidro), a bioeletricidade a partir da queima de bagaço e palha e o biogás e biometano a partir de vinhaça.

Mas a versatilidade da cana vêm sendo estudada para produção de outros biocombustíveis, como o Hidrogenio verde, que pode ser empregado em ônibus, caminhões e navios; o Metanol verde, voltado para veículos pesados; e o SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), biocombustível destinado à aviação.

Brasil na frente

O Brasil é o segundo maior produtor mundial de etanol, atrás apenas dos Estados Unidos, que fabrica o combustível a partir do milho.

Contudo, segundo especialistas, o país tem condições de ampliar sua participação e liderar as exportações globais de biocombustíveis de baixo carbono e intermediários derivados da cana-de-açúcar.

A combinação entre escala agrícola, experiência industrial, certificações e baixo carbono posicional — com potencial de captura do CO2 gerado na fermentação — pode representar uma importante vantagem comparativa.

""Enquanto o milho, nos Estados Unidos, rende de 4 a 5 mil litros de etanol por hectare, a cana brasileira produz, em média, 7 mil litros por hectare, podendo ultrapassar os 10 mil litros com a integração do etanol de segunda geração"", afirma Alexandre Alves, agrônomo e chefe-geral da Embrapa Agroenergia.

Segundo ele, em termos de mitigação, entre 2003 — ano do lançamento dos carros flex — e março de 2025, o uso do etanol em substituição à gasolina evitou que mais de 730 milhões de toneladas de CO2 fossem lançadas na atmosfera. Para alcançar efeito semelhante na natureza, seria necessário cultivar cerca de 5,1 bilhões de árvores ao longo dos próximos 20 anos.

""Outro diferencial que pode colocar o Brasil na liderança da produção de biocombustíveis é o fato de que os processos de colheita e de processamento industrial da cana já estão bastante consolidados, permitindo o aproveitamento quase integral da biomassa: caldo para etanol; bagaço e palha para eletricidade e E2G; vinhaça e torta para biogás; e CO2 da fermentação para e-fuels"", aponta o chefe-geral da Embrapa Agroenergia.

Além disso, o país dispõe de uma infraestrutura consolidada — agrícola, industrial e logística — e de um sistema de governança robusto, com certificações como o RenovaBio, que mede a intensidade de carbono da produção.

O país também conta com uma vantagem territorial. ""Estudos mostram que o Brasil possui uma extensa área de pastagens degradadas que pode ser aproveitada, permitindo ampliar diversas vezes a produção de etanol, sem causar impacto ambiental significativo"", ressalta Thiago Lopes, professor da USP.

Mas é preciso investimento para acelerar o estabelecimento da cana como fonte energética.

Alexandre Alves, da Embrapa Agroenergia, defende, como próximos passos, o fortalecimento do RenovaBio, o estabelecimento de marcos regulatórios para captura, uso e armazenamento de carbono aplicados às usinas de etanol, além do incentivo à produção de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) e fomento à produção de biometano e hidrogênio a partir da biomassa e do etanol.

Também são indispensáveis investimentos em infraestrutura e logística voltados à exportação de energéticos renováveis derivados da cana. E, para consolidar o Brasil como fornecedor confiável de energia limpa, é fundamental avançar em certificações reconhecidas internacionalmente.

""O Brasil já cultiva mais de 8 milhões de hectares de cana, mas tem potencial para expandir sobre pastagens de baixa produtividade, sem pressionar os biomas sensíveis. Ou seja, a cana pode sim de alguma maneira ser considerada o novo petróleo verde"", conclui Alves.",https://conteudo.imguol.com.br/c/noticias/bb/2025/07/18/cana-de-acucar-colhida-por-usina-em-alagoas-estado-que-mais-produz-no-nordeste-1752888976662_v2_615x300.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 06:56:48.689624

“It is with great pleasure that we have just formalized this agreement, which is very important for Niger,” said the Prime Minister. “The agreement is part of our strong cooperation with the African Development Bank Group.”

The support from the African Development Fund will increase national electricity access from 22.5 percent to 30 percent by 2026, while boosting the manufacturing sector’s contribution to GDP from 2.5 percent to 3.8 percent.

A key component of the project focuses on developing renewable energy capacity, with plans for 240 MW of solar power by 2030, including 50 MW by December 2026.

Prime Minister Zeine, who is also Niger’s Minister of Economy and Finance and serves as Governor of the Bank Group for his country, said the Bank’s support came at an important time, and the process has now led to the establishment of the program which aims to support the country’s economic competitiveness.

“It will also cushion Niger against multiple shocks through improved access to energy, promotion of the private sector, consolidation of the fiscal framework, and better consideration of vulnerable groups within public policies,” Premier Zaine added.

Beyond the energy sector, the program will strengthen public financial management systems while enhancing tax revenue mobilization and control systems.

It will further support the clearance of domestic arrears, enhance public-private partnerships dialogue, and promote the adoption of an industrial and trade policy to bolster Niger’s private sector.

“I can assure you that the African Development Bank Group will remain, as it has always been, a strong supporter of all our regional member states in their pursuit of harmonious development and shared prosperity,” said Dr Ould Tah.

“I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Bank’s teams for their hard work and also to thank the Board of Directors for its support for our efforts.”

Social inclusion

This high-impact program prioritizes social inclusion, and specialized support for internally displaced persons, women, and young persons.

With more than 507,000 internally displaced people due to security challenges in the Sahel region, PAGSEC has outlined a social and economic inclusion program to cushion vulnerable communities.

It will also establish high-level coordination mechanisms and update national energy policies to create a favorable environment for private-sector participation in mini-grid developments crucial for rural electrification.

With this program, Niger is set to capitalize on its vast renewable energy potential while building governance systems that support inclusive and sustainable development.

महाराष्ट्र शासनाच्या भूविकास प्राधिकरण CIDCO आणि अदानी समूह यांच्या संयुक्त विद्यमाने या भव्य प्रकल्पाची निर्मिती करण्यात आली आहे. या प्रकल्पात अदानी समूहाचा 74% आणि CIDCO चा 26% हिस्सा आहे. विमानतळ पूर्ण झाल्यावर मुंबई महानगर क्षेत्राला हवाई वाहतुकीचे जागतिक केंद्र बनवण्यासाठी हे पाऊल महत्त्वाचे ठरेल.

सिडकोचे उपाध्यक्ष आणि व्यवस्थापकीय संचालक विजय सिंघल यांनी माहिती दिली की, पंतप्रधान मोदी दुपारी 2.40 वाजता विमानतळावर दाखल होतील आणि जवळपास दोन तास उपस्थित राहतील. ते टर्मिनल इमारतीची पाहणी करून उपस्थितांना संबोधित करतील. या विमानतळावरून व्यावसायिक उड्डाणे डिसेंबर महिन्यापासून सुरू होतील, असेही त्यांनी स्पष्ट केले.

वाढीव क्षमता आणि कनेक्टिव्हिटी

नवी मुंबई आंतरराष्ट्रीय विमानतळ हे 1,160 हेक्टर परिसरात पसरलेले आहे. सर्व चार टप्पे पूर्ण झाल्यावर या विमानतळाची प्रवासी हाताळण्याची क्षमता वार्षिक 9 कोटी प्रवासी (MPPA) इतकी प्रचंड असेल, तर मालवाहतूक क्षमता 3.25 दशलक्ष मेट्रिक टन असेल. यामुळे हे आशियातील सर्वात मोठ्या विमान वाहतूक केंद्रांपैकी एक बनेल.

सिंघल यांनी सांगितले की, पहिल्या टप्प्यात पूर्ण झालेल्या टर्मिनल एकची क्षमता वार्षिक 20 दशलक्ष प्रवासी आणि 0.8 दशलक्ष मेट्रिक टन मालवाहतूक हाताळण्याची आहे. सध्याच्या मुंबईतील छत्रपती शिवाजी महाराज आंतरराष्ट्रीय विमानतळाची क्षमता वार्षिक सुमारे 55 दशलक्ष प्रवासी आहे. नवी मुंबईतील हे नवीन विमानतळ पूर्णपणे कार्यान्वित झाल्यावर, ही दोन्ही विमानतळे मिळून वार्षिक जवळपास 150 दशलक्ष प्रवाशांना सेवा देऊ शकतील, ज्यामुळे मुंबई महानगर क्षेत्र जागतिक स्तरावरील मोठे विमान वाहतूक केंद्र बनेल. DGCA या विमान वाहतूक सुरक्षा नियामकाकडून या विमानतळाला 30 सप्टेंबर रोजी आवश्यक असलेला एअरोड्रोम परवाना प्राप्त झाला आहे.

अत्याधुनिक सुविधा आणि हरित विमानतळ

नवी मुंबई आंतरराष्ट्रीय विमानतळ अनेक अत्याधुनिक सुविधांनी सुसज्ज असेल. हे देशातील पहिले विमानतळ असेल, जे एक्स्प्रेस-वे, महामार्ग, मेट्रो, उपनगरीय रेल्वे आणि वॉटर टॅक्सी अशा विविध वाहतूक माध्यमांनी जोडले जाईल.

हे एक हरित विमानतळ (Greenfield Airport) देखील आहे. यात शाश्वत विमान इंधनासाठी (sustainable aviation fuel) साठवणूक सुविधा उपलब्ध असेल. तसेच, विमानतळावर ऑटोमेटेड पॅसेंजर पीपल्स मूव्हर (APPM) सुविधा असेल, जी चारही टर्मिनलना अंतर्गत जोडेल, ज्यामुळे प्रवाशांचा प्रवास सुलभ होईल. या सर्व वैशिष्ट्यांमुळे NMIA हे भविष्यासाठी तयार असलेले एक अत्यंत कार्यक्षम विमानतळ ठरेल.","https://static.langimg.com/photo/imgsize-898430,msid-124315748/economictimes-marathi.jpg",N,,2025-10-05 06:56:59.164466

Den künftigen Passagieren fällt eine Neuheit sofort auf: Das Flugzeug hat keine Fenster. Stattdessen sollen große Bildschirme eine Panoramasicht ermöglichen.

Durch die eigentümliche Form wollen die Ingenieure der Phantom 3500 ein lange bekanntes Problem der Luftfahrt gelöst haben. Laut Hersteller soll das Modell den Kerosinverbrauch um 60 Prozent reduzieren. Beim Betrieb mit Sustainable Aviation Fuel rechnet das Unternehmen mit 92 Prozent weniger CO2-Ausstoß. Dies könnte laut dem ""Wallstreet Journal"" den Privatjet-Markt revolutionieren

Günstiger als Business-Class: Flughöhe und laminare Strömung machen Privat-Jet effizient

Das Flugzeug soll mit vier Passagieren an Bord 3200 nautische Meilen zurücklegen können, das ist vergleichbar mit dem Airbus A320 und entspricht über 5900 Kilometern. Die Reiseflughöhe ist dabei deutlich größer als bei bisherigen Verkehrsflugzeugen. Die Phantom 3500 soll bis auf 51.000 Fuß oder 15,5 Kilometer steigen. Doch das eigentlich innovative an dem Konzept ist die Form des Rumpfes.

Denn um das Flugzeug herum entsteht ein Effekt, der den Luftwiderstand dramatisch reduziert: laminare Strömung. Dabei fließt die Luft in einzelnen Ebenen um den Rumpf, ohne dass sich Verwirbelungen bilden, die das Flugzeug bremsen. Dieser Effekt ist lange bekannt, doch bisher nahmen Experten an, dass eine ineffiziente und turbulente Strömung bei Flugzeugen ab bestimmten Geschwindigkeiten unvermeidbar ist – wie bei einem Wasserstrahl, der zuerst durchsichtig ist und weiß wird, sobald der Hahn voll aufgedreht ist.

Doch Otto Aerospace gibt an, dass die Phantom 3500 selbst bei 950 Kilometern pro Stunde mit laminarer Strömung fließt.

Privatjet-Riese will 300 Flugzeuge bestellen

Flexjet, einer der größten Anbieter von gemieteten Privatjets, hat sich mit dieser Großbestellung stark zum Phantom 3500 positioniert. Laut einer Pressemitteilung von Otto Aerospace zeigte sich Flexjet-CEO begeistert von dem Flugzeug und seinem modernen Ansatz. Unterstützt von einer Kapitalerhöhung in Höhe von 800 Millionen US-Dollar plant das Unternehmen, den Jet schrittweise in seine Flotte zu integrieren. Der Einsatz des Phantom 3500 könnte den Standard im privaten Flugzeugmarkt neu definieren.

Auch die fensterlose Innenkabine mit 360-Grad-Panoramabildschirmen und einer komfortablen Höhe von 195 Centimetern machten die Phantom 3500 zu einem vielversprechenden Projekt, das den gesamten Markt verändern könnte.

Phantom 3500 soll ab 2030 fliegen

Laut ""Wall Street Journal"" soll der erste Testflug des Phantom 3500 im Jahr 2027 stattfinden, mit anschließenden Auslieferungen ab 2030. Die regulatorische Zulassung sieht keine Hindernisse vor, da Fenster laut der amerikanischen Flugaufsichtsbehörde FAA für Zertifizierungen nicht verpflichtend sind. Es soll aber Fenster an Notausgängen geben. Außerdem hat das Startup mit der Celera 500L bereits ein ähnliches Design mit Propellerantrieb in die Luft gebracht.

Privatjet günstiger als Business-Class: Das gibt es bereits heute

In Deutschland gibt es bereits Anbieter, die das Fliegen mit Privatjet zu vergleichbaren Preisen anbieten wie ein Business-Class-Ticket. Wer semi-privat fliegt, kann die Annehmlichkeiten wie weniger Wartezeit und exklusiven Zugang zum Rollfeld ohne Massenabfertigung bei der Sicherheitskontrolle genießen - nimmt aber auch mehr CO₂-Emissionen in Kauf.

Both scenarios put the SAF industry on the brink of an exponential increase in capacity and production towards an identified tipping point of 30 billion liters by 2030, with the right supportive policies.

The airlines commit to achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 and see SAF as a key contributor. Current estimates expect SAF to account for 65% of the mitigation needed for this, requiring a production capacity of 450 billion liters per year by 2050.

Having agreed a Long Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) on climate at the 41st Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in October 2022, governments now share the same goal for the decarbonisation of aviation and the interest in the success of SAF.

“There was at least triple the amount of SAF on the market in 2022 than there was in 2021. And airlines used every drop, even at very high prices! If more were available, it would have been purchased. That makes it clear that this is a supply problem and that market forces alone are insufficient to solve it. Governments, now sharing the same net-zero target for 2050, must implement comprehensive production incentives for SAF. It's what they did to successfully transition economies to renewable sources of electricity. And it is what aviation needs to decarbonise”, said Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.

To date, more than 450,000 commercial flights have been operated with SAF, and the increasing number of airlines signing purchase agreements with producers sends a clear signal to the markets that SAF is needed in greater quantities and, in the future, As of 2022, around 40 purchase agreements have been signed. been announced.

Incentive-based policies

Until we have commercialized options for alternative energy sources such as hydrogen, all SAF supply for aviation will be derived from biofuel refineries. These refineries produce renewable biodiesel and biogas, as well as SAF, and their refining capacity is expected to grow by more than 400% by 2025 compared to 2022.

JGC Corporation President, Shoji Yamada, expressed optimism about the collaboration, adding that it aligns with the company’s commitment to sustainable energy and economic development.

“By leveraging our experience in plant engineering and sustainable energy, we aim to contribute to Africa’s decarbonisation efforts while fostering local economic growth and innovation,” he said.

The partnership reinforces the AfDB’s sustainable transport and energy transition agenda, marking a significant stride toward Africa’s green aviation future.

O encontro teve como objetivo debater a integração entre a Petrobras e a agropecuária como impulsionadores do desenvolvimento do Brasil.
“É um orgulho ter sido o ministro que recebeu, pela primeira vez em 165 anos do Ministério da Agricultura, a presidente da Petrobras.
E o inverso, a gente entende o agro pode, deve e vai ser importante para a Petrobras”, destacou o ministro da Carlos Fávaro.

O encontro teve como objetivo debater a integração entre a Petrobras e a agropecuária como impulsionadores do desenvolvimento do Brasil.

“É um orgulho ter sido o ministro que recebeu, pela primeira vez em 165 anos do Ministério da Agricultura, a presidente da Petrobras. Esse encontro aproxima de forma concreta o agro e o setor de energia. É a relevância que o agro se tornou no Brasil, como ele é estratégico. E o inverso, a gente entende o agro pode, deve e vai ser importante para a Petrobras”, destacou o ministro da Carlos Fávaro.

Na ocasião, foi apresentado que a empresa se aproxima do agronegócio em três frentes distintas: originação de matérias-primas, polos de venda e venda direta para grandes consumidores.

A presidente da Petrobras evidenciou que a estratégia da estatal para os próximos anos passa pela integração entre os principais setores da economia brasileira. “O futuro do Brasil é um futuro em que o agronegócio e o setor petrolífero caminham juntos. São dois dos principais motores da nossa economia e precisam se complementar”, afirmou Magda Chambriard.

A empresa tem buscado a ampliação no Centro Oeste e MATOPIBA, regiões que tem vocação natural para a produção agrícola com disponibilidade de terras agriculturáveis e clima favorável â produção agrícola. A demanda do agronegócio nestas regiões mais que dobrou sua demanda de diesel nos últimos anos.

Também foi ressaltado que há oportunidades para expansão do transporte dutoviário e ferroviário, além de possibilidades de escoamento de produção e incremento na produção de biocombustíveis, como etanol de milho e biodiesel.

Com iniciativas existentes em produtos renováveis como óleos vegetais, gorduras animais, a Petrobras se aproximou do agronegócio para a originação de matérias-primas para a produção de Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) que consiste em um biocombustível avançado, produzido a partir de óleos vegetais (como soja, palma) ou gorduras animais, tratados com hidrogênio e do Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) que consiste em um combustível sustentável de aviação, feito de matérias-primas renováveis como óleos vegetais, gorduras animais, resíduos agrícolas ou até lixo urbano.

O ministro Fávaro ressaltou que esta integração abrirá novas perspectivas para o Brasil. “Estamos abrindo uma série de oportunidades em um novo caminho que o mundo está trilhando: a produção de energia renovável, verde e limpa, que nasce da terra”, afirmou.

Ainda, foi exposto que existem acordos formados entre o Mapa, a Petrobras e a Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (Embrapa) para parcerias com cooperativas para ofertas produtos e assistência técnica aos consumidores finais. Além disso, produzem juntamente com a Embrapa e com Centro de Pesquisas Leopoldo Américo Miguez de Mello (Cenpes) fertilizantes de eficiência aumentada para o uso de matérias primas alternativas.

A parceria entre o Mapa e a estatal no MATOPIBA iniciou em março deste ano, após reuniões técnicas em que foram identificadas oportunidades de atuação e ocorreu a articulação de uma operação de visita na região junto a associações e produtores rurais com o objetivo de ampliar ainda mais a atuação da Petrobras na região.

Segundo a presidente Magda Chambriard, a Petrobras reconhece a importância dessas iniciativas. “Não estamos aqui para destruir nenhuma política pública. Pelo contrário, entendemos que esses investimentos foram necessários para valorizar o que temos de melhor: o petróleo e o agro”, reforçou.

Then it’s always watching on both the state and the federal side burdensome regulations that directly impact farm income.","SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — Farm income concerns along with state and federal issues continue to be a focus of Illinois Farm Bureau.

Brian Duncan, a grain and livestock farmer near Polo in Ogle County and IFB president, discussed the many issues facing agriculture during an interview at the Illinois State Fair’s Ag Day.

What are the top concerns IFB is focusing on?

Duncan: I think the thing we talk about that’s kind of overarches everything right now is farm income. We’re very concerned as we continue to read the economic reports coming out of the University of Illinois.

Every farm’s got a little bit of a different economic story but, in general, this year, last year, next year, an awful lot of our members are going to be upside down.

We know the cattle industry is on a roll, and good for them, they deserve it because they had a rough ride before this.

The hog industry, which I’m a part of, is seeing some daylight, but has a big hole to backfill, and row crops, I’m hoping we can find a bottom pretty soon. But farm income is a real concern.

We are grateful for the passage of the ag provisions, that were contained in the budget bill. Those have the potential to be beneficial. We’re grateful of the tax provisions. Those are beneficial.

Is trade an ongoing concern?

Duncan: We are hoping for some significant wins here as trade has become cloudy. Our trade relationships are cloudy. We’re seeing a lot of frameworks announced and that’s good.

That provides a discussion for further deals, but I keep looking to read specific amounts of Illinois commodities or ethanol that are going to be moving into some of these countries, and it just appears we need to get some meat on the bones on some of these deals.

I try to look at things as challenges and opportunities, and a lot of challenges you can turn into an opportunity with the right work, the right connections and the right communication, and that’s what we’re trying to do as an organization.

There are also some trade wins. I met with the Office of Public Liaison at the White House. I talked about easy wins, low-hanging fruit, such as year-round E15, whole milk back in public schools. There are things here.

The “Make America Healthy Again” report creates some interesting challenges and opportunities. Challenges to our science that we rely on, that we want to make sure we’re using sound science, but maybe opportunities for good farm-raised protein to once again be talked about in a positive light.

Our pork or beef, our poultry products, our dairy products, planning their place in schools and in people’s diets. So, again, rising up and meeting the significant needs of farm income.

On the state level, we’re still working hard with stakeholders on getting estate tax relief. That is a battle we are not going to give up on.

We know property taxes have become an increasing concern for our members, and we are not taking that issue lightly either.

Then it’s always watching on both the state and the federal side burdensome regulations that directly impact farm income. It is a full plate.

Fortunately we’ve got a great team at Illinois Farm Bureau, and fortunately we’ve got great members that we rely on to help carry the message to the representatives, to their congressmen.

What are some of the things you’d like to see in the mini farm bill?

Duncan: Security for an interstate commerce. It goes beyond Proposition 12. If that is a not fixed it is a precedent that is dangerous for all of agriculture to allow one state to regulate how Illinois farmers grow their products. It’s a bad precedent.

I hope there’s an opportunity to perhaps discuss some of the Environmental Quality Incentives Program dollars. Some of that funding that was maybe not appropriated that we had farmers counting on.

Again, anything that we can do to talk about incentivizing biofuels, the trade title, there’s a ton yet to discuss. Those are a few of the biggies.

Year after year, there’s talk on Capitol Hill about year-round E15, sustainable aviation fuel and other renewable fuel issues, but no concrete action is taken by Congress. So, what can be done?

Duncan: We went the tax credits to be right, and we think the extension of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit is a good step.

And the next-generation biofuels, I think, has a positive story to tell. It takes time to build out infrastructure and we want to make sure the demand is there.

I had U.K. Consul General Richard Hyde at my farm and asked him about the opportunities for sustainable aviation fuel for planes coming from Europe and from the U.K. He says, “We’re all in.”

So, they have to refuel somewhere, right? And we know there’s biofuel producers in this state that are making commitments to produce both renewable fuels from both corn and soybeans and that’s a positive.

We want to make sure that the tax credits and the infrastructure remains something that we can rely on, because something that’s here today and gone tomorrow makes people very hesitant to invest the kind of dollars that are needed.",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/fhRE4GFPEm1RxzUKPfgigL02MYo=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/VNOHSJYTYFHZJB3PVTXVWRBDCQ.JPG,N,,2025-10-04 20:56:09.260469

To be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 8, NMIA spans 1,160 hectares and will feature four terminals—one of which is complete and scheduled to begin operations in December.

“NMIA can be compared with Heathrow Airport in London, which covers 1,227 hectares and has five terminals. Once fully operational, NMIA will handle 90 million passengers annually, transforming Mahamumbai into a major aviation hub,” said Vijay Singhal, Vice Chairman and Managing Director (VC & MD) of CIDCO.

PM Modi is expected to arrive at NMIA at 2:40 p.m., inspect the terminal building, and address a public gathering. After the inauguration, the airport will be handed over to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) for 45 days of security checks. Subsequently, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) will conduct detailed inspections to ensure compliance with national aviation safety standards. Following these procedures, both domestic and international flight operations will commence by December.

“This airport’s commissioning involves extensive security and regulatory checks. The October 8 ceremony marks the formal inauguration, but flight operations—domestic and international—will start by December,” explained Singhal.

Highlighting NMIA’s superior accessibility, Singhal added, “This is the country’s first international airport offering multi-modal connectivity—with road access from both eastern and western sides, a proposed metro corridor, and an upcoming water taxi service.”

Strategically located, NMIA will also strengthen connectivity to Pune, Nashik, and the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). “Being centrally positioned, the airport will provide international connectivity to Pune, PMR, Nashik, and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). It is not just an airport but a transformative infrastructure project that will accelerate regional growth,” he emphasized.

The new-age Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA), once fully completed, will feature an underground Automated People Mover (APM) — a mini underground train system designed to transport passengers seamlessly between Terminals 1 and 4, regardless of their check-in terminal. The airport will also include dedicated facilities for storing sustainable aviation fuel, making it both environmentally friendly and a model of sustainable airport infrastructure.

Project Overview

Total Area: 1,160 hectares

Completion: Scheduled in four phases

Design: Lotus-inspired terminal symbolizing modern, sustainable architecture with advanced technology and high operational efficiency

Phase-Wise Capacity:

Phase 1: 20 million passengers per annum (MPPA); 0.8 million metric tons (MMT) of cargo

Expansão e energias renováveis

A Petrobras tem buscado ampliar sua presença nas regiões do Centro-Oeste e MATOPIBA (Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí e Bahia), reconhecidas pela forte vocação agrícola. De acordo com o Mapa, a demanda por diesel nessas áreas mais que dobrou nos últimos anos devido ao crescimento do agronegócio. Durante o encontro, a estatal também destacou o potencial de expansão da infraestrutura logística, com foco no transporte dutoviário e ferroviário, além de alternativas para o escoamento da produção e o aumento da oferta de biocombustíveis como etanol de milho e biodiesel.

Em uma linha similar, Chambriard e Fávaro discutiram o aumento da produção desses combustíveis e o desenvolvimento de alternativas avançadas, como o Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) e o Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Esses biocombustíveis utilizam matérias-primas renováveis, incluindo óleos vegetais, gorduras animais e resíduos agrícolas, alinhando-se com a tendência mundial de energias limpas e renováveis.

Parcerias e colaborações estratégicas

Além da integração de energia renovável, o encontro também abordou as parcerias estabelecidas entre o Mapa, a Petrobras e a Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (Embrapa). Essas parcerias têm como objetivo ampliar a oferta de produtos e fornecer assistência técnica aos consumidores finais, por meio de cooperativas.

Industry leaders have just revealed during the Africa Energy Week (AEW) event in Cape Town, South Africa, running under the theme of ‘Invest in African Energies 2025.’

Emmanuelle Garinet, is the Vice President of Exploration Africa at TotalEnergies, who points out that Africa’s frontier basins hold significant volumes.

Garinet reveals that Namibia is an example of how seismic and subsurface data can de-risk projects.

“When we decided to drill the Venus well, it was frontier, but we had a probability of success of more than 50 percent because of the seismic data and direct hydrocarbon indicators,” says Garinet.

In the Republic of Congo, TotalEnergies’ exploration permitting process is moving at a markedly faster pace.

“We got our permit in less than six months and are preparing for drilling by the end of the year,” She said.

By contrast, South Africa’s permitting system has faced delays due to legal challenges, a problem she described as “unacceptable” given limited budgets for global exploration.

The Chief Executive at Chevron, Gavin Lewis, emphasized the critical role of comprehensive subsurface datasets in Africa.

“Before you can do any AI-driven workflows, you need a dataset that illuminates what the subsurface looks like,” he said.

“What Africa has lost is the ability to sponsor multi-client subsurface datasets. The only basin that allows for large, regional high-quality datasets is the Gulf of America, which has allowed that basin to reinvent itself multiple times.”

The Vice President of Exploration for BP, Bryan Ritchie, highlighted survey work in Egypt’s Nile Delta, where the company completed the first deepwater ocean-bottom node seismic survey over the Atoll field and noted that the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company plans to expand multi-client data coverage across a larger area of the delta.

‘We’re seeing new opportunities for these images,” he said.

Beyond exploration, Woodside Energy’s Vice President of Exploration, Terry Gebhardt, said geoscience and subsurface data are also key to carbon capture and storage projects, as well as “maximizing efficacy and recovery” in existing fields.

The panel discussion, sponsored by EnerGeo Alliance, also underlined the broader scale of investment in Africa’s oil and gas sector.

Nikki Martin, the Chief Executive Officer of EnerGeo Alliance, said African oil and gas capital expenditure is expected to rise to USD 54 billion by 2030, following a USD 6 billion surge in exploration spending in 2024.",https://tanzaniatimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/total-energy-chevron-in-africa-oil-exploration.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 13:56:49.855542

A bill currently going through parliament will ensure a fixed price for sustainable aviation fuel, to encourage investment in production.","One century ago, Italian aviator Francesco de Pinedo was attempting the unprecedented feat of traversing the Indian landmass in a flying boat. He later splashed down on the Tiber in Rome to national acclaim, having flown via Asia to Australia and returned after a seven-month period, taking off and landing in water 80 times.

The aviation sector has been characterized by stop-start journeys on previously unexplored routes to ambitious, if not unattainable, goals. The current shared belief – amid widespread doubt – is in pursuing a vague route toward eco-friendliness, via environmentally friendly fuels that are yet to be widely produced.

Industry Commitment and Challenges

Most in the aviation industry, if only for their own benefit, are on board with the theory. Of the identified emissions cuts needed for carbon neutrality, seven out of ten depend on sustainable aviation fuels, commonly known as SAF. “Lacking this,” notes Tim Alderslade from Airlines UK, “we cannot get anywhere near net zero by 2050.”

In the current year, initial measures were mandated in the EU and the UK, demanding that 2% of aircraft fuel be eco-friendly – by the year 2030, this rises to 6% in the EU and 10% in the UK.

Diverging Opinions Among Airlines

However, airlines have questioned whether supplies will be available and at what price. A fissure is developing between those that have secured sources of SAF and funded technological advancements, and those intensely focused on financial performance.

Ryanair’s CEO Michael O’Leary rejects SAF as impractical. He says: “It is all gradually dying a death, as it rightly should. We have just about met our 2% mandate. Reaching 6% by 2030 is unfeasible; attaining 10% is utterly hopeless. Net zero by 2050 is beyond our reach.”

More measured voices among SAF’s champions also have concerns. Willie Walsh, director general of the worldwide airline trade body Iata, had advocated for a 5% SAF blend in fuel by 2030. He admitted last week to disappointment in progress, noting he doubts the goal is attainable considering current SAF production levels”.

Government Initiatives and Production Hurdles

Britain is attempting to establish the structure with a guaranteed income system. A bill currently going through parliament will ensure a fixed price for sustainable aviation fuel, to encourage investment in production. The Department for Transport in July allocated £63m to seventeen firms aiming to produce SAF domestically. An official mentioned “promising initial indicators towards meeting the mandate” But only Phillips 66 in Humberside is making SAF at scale, while the five facilities pledged under the “jet zero” plan remain unrealized.

Incentives and penalties are essential, as major oil firms face diminishing reasons to adopt eco-friendly practices when invited to drill for easy profit. Shell’s decision to stop construction of a Rotterdam biofuel plant, anticipated as a major European waste-to-jet-fuel converter, will reduce SAF availability and increase costs. Concurrently, Donald Trump’s legislation cuts American subsidies for SAF manufacturing established under Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act – though, as a compromise to US agricultural producers, some subsidies on homegrown SAF feedstocks will continue for two more years.

International Views and Forward Projections

Philip New, a former BP alternative energy executive and government adviser on SAF, states: “I hold a bleak outlook for SAF in the United States. There’s no mandate or regulations or reason to use it.”

Beyond the US, geopolitics could weigh on supplies in various ways, he notes. Trade levies might redirect additional Chinese cooking oil to European SAF; simultaneously, Asian nations enacting their own requirements and limits could restrict exports.

New maintains that SAF will eventually materialize but warns: “It is going to be a lumpy transition.”

Technological Advances and Environmental Considerations

Current UK and EU mandates can be met entirely with HEFA-based SAF, made from sources such as recycled cooking oil – despite concerns about its origins. Greater challenges arise with governmental calls for second-generation SAF, made of feedstocks such as household rubbish.

Alderslade describes 2G output as “highly uncertain”. Failing to meet requirements, he states, will result in fines “which inevitably will be passed through to passengers”.

New remarks: “Theoretically, this offers an excellent waste disposal solution.” The challenge is getting the right level of support to back up the very high-risk first generations of these technologies.” Despite public support, 2030 goals for 2G are probably unattainable, he adds.

Investment and Long-Term Viability

Despite the risks, investors see the long-term value. An anonymous international investment manager said the US was an outlier in abandoning net zero, with mandates coming to Asia as well as Europe. “For oil majors, SAF is lower priority, it’s challenging – certain parties are withdrawing. However, carriers cannot forsake it. It’s going to be bumpy – but is it all coming down? No.”

Differing views among airlines, he suggests, may reflect the ease of access and price paid for SAF in their operational hubs: “There’s no shortage in the hubs.”

Business Approaches and Local Initiatives

The British Airways owner, IAG, says it has a “long-term commitment”, with some justification – it announced plans in 2011 for a pioneering waste-to-fuel plant in Essex, although it admitted defeat by 2017. IAG says there will be enough SAF to meet EU and UK mandates until 2030. But a spokesperson added: “Second and third generation SAFs do require more investment and development [and] support … Mandates are one lever to stimulate demand but investment in production is key.”

Positive developments continue to emerge: a Belfast company, Catagen, recently introduced proprietary modular systems capable of generating required SAF volumes in the vicinity of smaller airports, an innovation supported by Ryanair.

Airport-Specific Implications and Environmental Debates

For BA’s home airport, the debate has particular urgency: should the eco-aviation plan falter, Heathrow’s third runway becomes ever more politically difficult.

Heathrow’s carbon strategy director Matt Gorman insists: “SAF is not hypothetical. Heathrow is already leading globally in SAF use, 17% of global SAF in 2024 was consumed here. This is real progress, not a future promise.”

Some environmental campaigners, while remaining firmly against Heathrow expansion, have modified their stance on SAF, accepting it as a potential route to future decarbonisation – even if many fear it acts as a fig leaf to deflect environmental concerns today. Yet numerous advocates and researchers doubt the fundamental premise of SAF and its calculations of carbon reductions.

Aircraft will still release CO2 from engines – and in the broader context, will still be depleting resources. Matt Finch, in a report for the Aviation Environment Federation, said: “The blunt truth is that there is not a single SAF feedstock that can’t be used in another sector where it would bring a desirable environmental outcome. And in some cases, that outcome is already what a large proportion of the waste is used for.”

Sophisticated Fuel Varieties and Financial Constraints

That caveat applies even for the gold standard fuel, known as third-generation or e-SAF, produced through carbon capture and green power. It has been manufactured in limited amounts, and tested in a Swiss “solar fuel” flight this July. However, e-SAF needs eco-friendly hydrogen, resources that, Walsh notes, are “scarce and costly”. Current e-SAF backers, per a financial expert, “are likely to face losses”.

Past Precedents and Coming Forecasts

Historical patterns indicate uncertain technological trajectories. De Pinedo perished eight years post his seaplane accomplishments, in a conventional plane taking off from a runway in New York in 1933. Seaplanes were replaced by jet planes introduced during WWII.

“Forecasting will always entail some doubt,” Gorman remarks. “But what we’re doing is not guesswork. It’s based on evidence, expert consensus, and a clear roadmap.”",,N,,2025-10-04 22:56:49.400054

Many of those regional jets are made by Bombardier, Mitsubishi or, Embraer. Turboprop aircraft have not been the platform of choice for decades in the US, Europe, or Asia. Recently, that trend has shown signs of a shift as the rising need for environmentally sustainable and lower-cost aircraft may make turboprops the best choice in the coming years.

The likes of Embraer’s E-Jets and the Bombardier/Mitsubishi CRJ jet series may hold the dominant market share today, but as the oldest airframes begin to retire and the economics of jet operations get more difficult, an opening arises. Now we will dive into the key factors behind the new wave of turboprop hype that is driving demand for state-of-the-art models like the Dash 8 and D328.

The Prop Case

An airplane may be moved quite effectively with a propeller at the moderate speeds used for short regional flights (200 to 300 miles). It enables the engines to use a notably lower amount of fuel than the tiny jet engines seen on an Embraer 175 or CRJ-900. Since fuel is an airline's largest single-trip expense, the difference is key on the balance sheet.

Most of a regional flight is spent taxiing, climbing, and descending; the cruise portion, where the jet can stretch its legs, may last only fifteen minutes. A jet is likely to be only five or ten minutes ahead of propeller aircraft when they both arrive at the gate, which is negligible to offset the increased fuel consumption and ownership expenses.

Turboprops are also lighter and can operate from shorter runways. That gives airlines access to smaller airports with lower landing fees and lets them open routes that jets can’t serve economically. The initial cost of purchasing or renting a turboprop is also lower. Long-term maintenance costs can also be mitigated thanks to the ease and affordability of maintaining their engines and airframes. In a business notorious for razor-thin profit margins that can sink an airline, those numbers all add up to keep the bottom line in the black.

Keeping America Flying

In the US, regional flights are essential for linking rural and isolated communities to large cities and the national aviation network. Hundreds of small community airports depend on regional service. With smaller, more suitable aircraft, those carriers are essential in controlling traffic at large hubs, which reduces congestion. By expanding the reach of the national transportation system, these carriers provide accessibility for more localities. In addition to bridging remote regions, regional aviation enhances the nation's overall aviation infrastructure.

Larger airlines can expand their networks while keeping connections to low-traffic routes thanks to programs like American Eagle, Delta Connect, and United Express. An estimated $100 billion in annual economic product and one million American employees are supported by regional aviation, making it a significant economic driver. Regional aviation connects passengers to important hubs, promoting local travel, business, and tourism.

For people living in smaller towns, regional air travel provides quick access to urban amenities such as advanced healthcare and disaster relief. Regardless of the reason, regional flights drastically cut down on travel time and are often quicker and more practical than driving for short- to medium-distance travel.

Turboprops Around The World

Canada is characterized by large, sparsely inhabited regions with many isolated settlements that rely on air transportation. The Dash 8-400 is especially well-suited for connecting these smaller hubs to larger ones. For their regional networks, airlines like Porter Airlines and WestJet Encore make extensive use of the Dash 8-400. Canada is home to some of the world's busiest turboprop airports.

Turboprops are essential for improving connectivity in Southeast Asia and Oceania, regions with a large number of islands and frequently inadequate infrastructure. Indonesia, which has more than 17,000 islands, relies on turboprops extensively for flights between its islands, while the Philippines has a similar infrastructure.

The wide and varied topography of Africa, which includes several ""hot and high"" airports that favor turboprops, further highlights the usefulness of turboprops. A number of carriers have large fleets of turboprop aircraft. Ethiopian Airlines is one of the major operators of the Dash 8 in its domestic network, for example. Meanwhile, Brazil's extensive land territory and mature aviation network make turboprops an ideal choice for domestic flights, especially on shorter routes under 1,000 kilometers.

Australia and New Zealand use turboprops, much like in Canada or the US, to connect smaller fields with major hubs. The terrain of the two nations varies widely depending on the destination, which makes high reliability and performance under harsh conditions important. It can be tropical, “hot and high” or Alpine, depending on the itinerary.

In Europe, Norwegian Airlines uses a fleet of turboprops to navigate the difficult terrain of Norway, and Olympic Air uses turboprops for island-hopping flights in Greece. In the British Isles, turboprops are also used by airlines such as Aurigny in the Channel Islands and Loganair in Scotland. Operators in Malta and Spain's Canary Islands provide more evidence of the aircraft's applicability for short-distance flights across Europe.

Deutsche Aircraft D328eco

The D328 combines solid speed with turboprop efficiency, making it ideal for rugged regional routes. Airlines are able to serve airports in remote cities, mountains, and islands that are inaccessible to larger jets thanks to its innovative design. It has the quietest cabin in its class with pressurization and enlarged overhead bins. While fuel consumption and maintenance expenses remain modest, cruise speeds of about 300 miles per hour make it the fastest turboprop on the market.

It is powered by the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127XT engine and features the latest Garmin G5000 avionics in the cockpit. High reliability and low-maintenance cycles, with reduced costs per cycle, mean the plane has the lowest trip cost to operate in its class. Thomas Ahn, Chief Engineer of the D328eco at Deutsche Aircraft, remarked in a company statement earlier this May, saying:

“This is our moment to re-establish ourselves as a modern aircraft manufacturer with full system integration capabilities right here in Germany. We use advanced 3D modelling, seamless data sharing with suppliers, and state-of-the-art communication tools to enhance our development efficiency.”

The D328 is not only poised to be one of the most environmentally sustainable and affordable aircraft to fly, but its features and construction quality make it a “jack of all trades” that can support virtually any mission in the commercial, cargo, or specialized aviation markets. The plane will be competing to replace outgoing legacy models like the ATR 42 and Saab 340, matching the efficiency, capacity, and ruggedness of both in one package.

Deutsche Aircraft established its plant just outside Munich, in the historic home of Dornier, Oberpfaffenhofen. The first test aircraft is being assembled by a team of 550 staff with backgrounds from 40 different nations to create a plane that can fly on 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF-PtL). The 20-seat configuration is expected to have an impressive range of 1,772 nautical miles while the 40-seater will have a solid 621 nautical miles.

The Air Force’s Wolfhound

The main role of the C-146A Wolfhound is to support Theater Special Operations Commands by offering the US Special Operations Command the ability to deploy small teams and cargo in a flexible and rapid manner. Air Force Special Operations Command aircrews carry out airlift missions to semi-prepared airfields worldwide, which demands a rugged and reliable aircraft.

The C-146 has served in combatant commands on four continents, delivering troops and cargo on long-term deployments supporting continuous operations overseas. The aircraft has also been tailored to support medevac missions with defibrillators, cardiac monitoring equipment as well as hot and cold galley equipment. It is the first air ambulance aircraft with the capability to support Casevac and Medevac missions.

The D328 has succeeded in fulfilling the Air Force Special Operations Command’s (AFSOC) expectations since it entered service in 2011 as the Wolfhound. The airplane was even made to support intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and features an inflight operable door (IFOD) for free-fall parachute jumps. Deutsche Aircraft wants to transform that military track record into a launching pad for its commercial airframe to serve small communities all over the world just as well as it served the special forces.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/how-regional-turboprop-aircraft-are-making-a-comeback.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-04 12:56:21.370640

The state-of-the-art greenfield airport has been built at a cost of Rs 19,647 crore and will mark the second major airport in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region after the existing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport.

The commercial flight operations from Navi Mumbai Airport are expected to begin in December. The airport received its aerodrome licence from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on September 30.

The project is being developed in multiple phases by Navi Mumbai International Airport Ltd, with the Adani Group holding a 74 percent stake and the remaining 26 percent owned by the Maharashtra government’s City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO).

“The second airport of Maha Mumbai — Navi Mumbai International Airport — is going to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 8,” CIDCO Vice Chairman and Managing Director Vijay Singhal told PTI after a media briefing.

According to Singhal, the Prime Minister will land at the new airport at around 2:40 pm and will spend nearly two hours at the facility. “The Prime Minister will first visit the terminal building, and then take a round of the terminal building, and then he will be addressing the audience,” he said.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has assigned the code ‘NMI’ to Navi Mumbai International Airport. Domestic carriers, including Air India Group, IndiGo, and Akasa Air have already announced plans to shift part of their flight operations to the new facility.

Spread across 1,160 hectares, the airport will have four terminals with a total passenger capacity of 90 million per annum and a cargo capacity of 3.25 million metric tonnes once fully completed, making it one of Asia’s largest aviation hubs.

“To begin with, we have completed terminal one, with a capacity of 20 million passengers per annum, 0.8 million metric tonnes of cargo capacity and one runway,” Singhal said.

Currently, Mumbai International Airport handles around 55 million passengers annually. Once NMIA becomes fully operational, both airports together will manage nearly 150 million passengers per year.

“So, once this airport is fully completed, then these two airports together will cater to the almost 150 million passengers per annum, making the two airports a big aviation hub globally,” Singhal said.

He added that while Rs 19,647 crore has been spent on Phase 1, the total cost of completing all four terminals is expected to reach Rs 1 lakh crore.

Navi Mumbai International Airport will also be the first aerodrome in India to be connected by expressways, highways, metro lines, suburban rail, and even water taxi services.

“This is also a green airport as it has the storage facility for sustainable aviation fuel,” Singhal noted. He added that the facility will feature an Automated Passenger People’s Mover system to internally connect all four terminals.

Local Disruptions Add to Lufthansa’s Hurdles Regional transport challenges in Hesse have compounded Lufthansa’s operational load.","Frankfurt, October 4, 2025 – Lufthansa, Germany’s flagship carrier, is once again under the spotlight as flight delays and operational challenges impact travelers across the Hesse region this week. According to recent updates from Hessenschau, ongoing weather disturbances, traffic congestion, and regional infrastructure works have collectively disrupted air travel, particularly affecting Lufthansa’s primary hub at Frankfurt Airport.

Lufthansa Battles Delays Amid Weather and Infrastructure Strain

Lufthansa flights experienced multiple delays over the past few days due to dense fog, technical maintenance on Frankfurt’s runways, and heavy passenger congestion. Frankfurt Airport, one of Europe’s busiest aviation hubs, continues to face operational strain as Lufthansa navigates increased travel demand following a record-breaking summer season.

Passengers reported waiting for hours for both departures and arrivals, with some domestic and short-haul European flights rescheduled to later slots. Lufthansa confirmed that it is “working closely with airport authorities to ensure smoother operations and minimize passenger inconvenience.”

While these temporary disruptions are not uncommon during seasonal transitions, Lufthansa’s operations have been particularly stretched by a surge in travel volume and parallel infrastructure issues on the ground, such as partial U-Bahn closures in Frankfurt and a recent A66 highway accident near Wiesbaden that delayed passengers en route to the airport.

Lufthansa Maintains Strong Recovery Post-Pandemic

Despite the turbulence, Lufthansa’s broader recovery story remains strong. The airline’s financial performance in the last quarter of 2025 showed a marked improvement, with revenues exceeding expectations thanks to higher premium cabin occupancy and growing corporate travel demand.

Industry analysts note that Lufthansa’s profitability in 2025 signals a solid rebound from the post-pandemic slump. However, operational reliability remains an ongoing challenge as the airline strives to balance expansion and service consistency.

CEO Carsten Spohr has emphasized Lufthansa’s continued commitment to innovation, sustainability, and digital transformation. The airline’s focus on modernizing its fleet and investing in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) demonstrates its long-term vision for responsible growth. “Our mission is to lead Europe in sustainable aviation while ensuring passengers experience world-class reliability,” Spohr said during a recent industry briefing.

Lufthansa Expands Long-Haul Network and Green Initiatives

Lufthansa’s strategic roadmap includes expanding its long-haul network to major business destinations in North America and Asia. The airline has also introduced next-generation aircraft designed to reduce carbon emissions and improve fuel efficiency.

In alignment with its sustainability goals, Lufthansa aims to cut its net carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2030. The company is investing in partnerships for sustainable aviation fuel production and exploring innovative carbon offset programs to reduce environmental impact.

Moreover, Lufthansa continues to enhance customer experience through digital check-in systems, improved in-flight connectivity, and revamped lounges across major airports. These advancements are intended to reinforce Lufthansa’s position as a premium global carrier and restore customer confidence amid recent delays.

Local Disruptions Add to Lufthansa’s Hurdles

Regional transport challenges in Hesse have compounded Lufthansa’s operational load. With partial suspension of U-Bahn lines U6 and U7 in Frankfurt for track maintenance, and ongoing road repairs on major routes leading to Frankfurt Airport, many passengers have struggled to reach terminals on time.

The A66 highway closure near Wiesbaden, following a multi-vehicle accident earlier this week, resulted in widespread traffic jams that caused dozens of travelers to miss their Lufthansa flights. The airline responded by accommodating affected passengers on later flights and offering flexible rebooking options.

Lufthansa’s Resilience Reflects Broader Aviation Recovery

Lufthansa’s continued growth amidst such logistical hurdles reflects the resilience of Europe’s aviation industry. The airline’s ability to maintain high load factors despite sporadic disruptions underscores the enduring demand for air travel in both leisure and business segments.

Frankfurt, October 4, 2025 – Lufthansa, Germany’s flagship carrier, is once again under the spotlight as flight delays and operational challenges impact travelers across the Hesse region this week. According to recent updates from Hessenschau, ongoing weather disturbances, traffic congestion, and regional infrastructure works have collectively disrupted air travel, particularly affecting Lufthansa’s primary hub at Frankfurt Airport.

Lufthansa Battles Delays Amid Weather and Infrastructure Strain

Lufthansa flights experienced multiple delays over the past few days due to dense fog, technical maintenance on Frankfurt’s runways, and heavy passenger congestion. Frankfurt Airport, one of Europe’s busiest aviation hubs, continues to face operational strain as Lufthansa navigates increased travel demand following a record-breaking summer season.

Passengers reported waiting for hours for both departures and arrivals, with some domestic and short-haul European flights rescheduled to later slots. Lufthansa confirmed that it is “working closely with airport authorities to ensure smoother operations and minimize passenger inconvenience.”

While these temporary disruptions are not uncommon during seasonal transitions, Lufthansa’s operations have been particularly stretched by a surge in travel volume and parallel infrastructure issues on the ground, such as partial U-Bahn closures in Frankfurt and a recent A66 highway accident near Wiesbaden that delayed passengers en route to the airport.

Lufthansa Maintains Strong Recovery Post-Pandemic

Despite the turbulence, Lufthansa’s broader recovery story remains strong. The airline’s financial performance in the last quarter of 2025 showed a marked improvement, with revenues exceeding expectations thanks to higher premium cabin occupancy and growing corporate travel demand.

Industry analysts note that Lufthansa’s profitability in 2025 signals a solid rebound from the post-pandemic slump. However, operational reliability remains an ongoing challenge as the airline strives to balance expansion and service consistency.

CEO Carsten Spohr has emphasized Lufthansa’s continued commitment to innovation, sustainability, and digital transformation. The airline’s focus on modernizing its fleet and investing in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) demonstrates its long-term vision for responsible growth. “Our mission is to lead Europe in sustainable aviation while ensuring passengers experience world-class reliability,” Spohr said during a recent industry briefing.

Lufthansa Expands Long-Haul Network and Green Initiatives

Lufthansa’s strategic roadmap includes expanding its long-haul network to major business destinations in North America and Asia. The airline has also introduced next-generation aircraft designed to reduce carbon emissions and improve fuel efficiency.

In alignment with its sustainability goals, Lufthansa aims to cut its net carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2030. The company is investing in partnerships for sustainable aviation fuel production and exploring innovative carbon offset programs to reduce environmental impact.

Moreover, Lufthansa continues to enhance customer experience through digital check-in systems, improved in-flight connectivity, and revamped lounges across major airports. These advancements are intended to reinforce Lufthansa’s position as a premium global carrier and restore customer confidence amid recent delays.

Local Disruptions Add to Lufthansa’s Hurdles

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) recently received certification to produce SAF at its Panipat refinery, paving the way for domestic production.

The SAF blend will be developed using the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) method, relying on feedstock such as used cooking oil and agricultural residue like rice straw (parali).

Delhi was selected for the pilot as IOC’s Panipat refinery already supplies aviation turbine fuel (ATF) to the airport via a dedicated pipeline.

“That is the beauty of SAF. You don’t have to change the infrastructure to implement it. It’s like fossil fuel,” said the Deputy Director of the Environment Branch, Air Transport Bureau, at the UN body International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), as quoted by The Hindu BusinessLine.

Hupe noted that India’s existing fuel distribution pipeline is a major asset, reducing the need for costly new infrastructure.

“The infrastructure they already have to produce and distribute fuel to the airport can also be used for SAF, and that’s a big plus for this technology,” she told businessline.

SAF is central to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), a global effort to reduce aviation emissions. The scheme is being implemented in three phases, with voluntary participation from 2021 to 2026.

India has opted out of the voluntary phase but will begin offsetting obligations for international carriers under CORSIA from 2027. The scheme applies to international flights between two countries.

To meet these future obligations, the Indian government plans to introduce SAF blending targets in aviation fuel. These start with a 1% SAF blend in ATF in 2027, rising to 2% in 2028, and 5% by 2030.

The Gazette asked all candidates: What strategies would you pursue to strengthen collaboration with neighbouring municipalities and regional partners, and how would these efforts improve services or economic development in Sturgeon County?

Each mayoral candidate in Sturgeon County had 350 words to answer the question.

Patrick Tighe: I believe we have services within the county area that could become regional with minimal changes in service to the residents, but provide better value.

For example, the Roseridge Landfill Site for solid household waste (garbage) provides this service for the entire county region, as well as other areas.

Fire and Protective Services is another area that could be regionalized with little service disruption. By reducing existing boundaries and establishing a connected community fire response instead of isolated fire stations, we would have improved services and potentially lowered insurance premiums. Strategic locations for equipment and trained personnel would provide a much-improved collaborative approach to emergencies that would benefit residents both in response time as well as cost effectiveness.

Utilities is another area that could be regionalized for improved services. Again, reducing standalone services and establishing a regional approach would provide better equipment, tools and skill levels that would bring efficiencies and cost effectiveness to all residents in time of need.

Economic development using models like Strathcona, Lac La Biche, and West Hants’ Regional Municipality, N.S., would improve Sturgeon County. Having the right location for the right developments, providing a streamlined and welcoming approach for new and existing businesses in Sturgeon County would benefit all and bring prosperity for the future.

Alanna Hnatiw: I will continue the successful strategies developed over the past eight years. We have increased awareness and momentum around the Villeneuve Airport Area. Much of this can be attributed to the relationships developed with neighbouring stakeholders through the creation of the Villeneuve Landing Network. We have partnered with towns and cities, post-secondary and academic institutions, First Nations, Métis nations, business associations and the provincial government to assess the economic development opportunities and inform the Area Structure Plan that was approved in 2024. This initiative has increased investment interest and supported the Sturgeon Public School Division’s successful application for an Aviation Collegiate at the Villeneuve Airport. This partnership between the school and the Edmonton Airport Authority was a direct result of our successful strategy of advocacy and relationship building. There are immense opportunities at the Villeneuve Airport for pilot training, aviation mechanics, machine repair and overhaul, autonomous aircraft development, sustainable aviation fuel, aerospace defence and advanced materials manufacturing.

I initiated the update of the Sturgeon Regional Partnership where Sturgeon county and the mayors of the five towns within our borders meet regularly and have our administrations foster organizational efficiency and effectiveness without the creation of unnecessary bureaucracy. The guiding principles of our partnership is to support local autonomy while emphasizing that local goals can often best be achieved through regional cooperation and partnerships. We commit to explore opportunities to improve the delivery of service through cooperative efforts and promote regional prosperity and economic development through partnerships and collaboration.

Sturgeon County has worked collaboratively with the Alberta Industrial Heartland Association and the provincial government on the creation of the first Designated Industrial Zone in Alberta. Through this designation and collaboration, we have received grant dollars towards Phase One of the Industrial Heartland Process Water Initiative.

KLM and KLM Cityhopper are testing a suite of innovative measures to reduce the environmental impact of their flights as part of the 2025 edition of The Aviation Challenge (TAC), the annual SkyTeam initiative promoting sustainable aviation.

From AI-driven water calculations to filtered seawater, the airline is exploring solutions that can be scaled into daily operations to reduce the impact on the environment.

Cutting emissions through innovation

Among the trials, KLM is using an AI model to predict the exact amount of water required onboard, helping to cut weight and emissions.

Pilots are testing flight optimisation tools designed to minimise fuel consumption, while business class passengers are encouraged to pre-select meals to reduce food waste.

Filtered seawater bottles are being introduced to replace standard bottled water, and passengers contributing to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) receive priority boarding.

Digital boarding passes, which have already cut paper usage by 84%, continue to be promoted.

The focus this year is broader than in previous trials, covering multiple flights rather than a single showcase route.

From 4 to 10 October, selected services include Amsterdam to Rome on the new Airbus A321neo, Amsterdam to Nairobi on an undisclosed aircraft type, and Amsterdam to Kraków on KLM Cityhopper’s Embraer E195-E2.

Reducing aviation’s environmental footprint

Alongside the passenger-facing initiatives, the airline is testing lighter catering equipment, smarter cargo loading strategies, and electric pushback vehicles.

The challenge, inspired by the historic 1934 London-to-Melbourne air race, now seeks to reduce aviation’s environmental footprint while sharing best practices across SkyTeam carriers.

“KLM acknowledges its environmental and climate impact and recognises the limits of what the planet can sustain. Action is required to operate within these limits,” the airline said.

KLM is also linking its sustainability work with social impact through Wings of Support, the volunteer-run foundation supporting local projects at KLM destinations.

In Nairobi, for example, the Big Five Center teaches children trades and vocational skills to improve long-term prospects in underserved communities.

KLM announced the programme on the same day that it unveiled its first Airbus A350 simulator in the Netherlands, marking a significant step in preparing for the arrival of the A350 aircraft, which will join the fleet at the end of 2026.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/KLM-Airbus-A321neo-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 10:56:31.804193

And without deep community support for energy projects — including renewable energy facilities — the generation we need may never be built.
Nebraska’s energy demand is projected to grow nearly 20% over the next decade.
If we turn away wind, solar or other generation projects that want to locate here, we may inadvertently turn away the bioeconomy and manufacturing investments they help power.
Large projects diversify the local tax base, reduce reliance on property taxes and create a stable revenue stream communities can control.","Nearly a century ago, George Norris, a great United States senator, made the case for electrifying rural America.

“These young men and young women, America’s farmers of the future, observing all the wonders of the modern age of electricity, will not be content with the homes of earlier America,” Norris wrote in his autobiography. “Unless those homes in the countrysides are lighted electrically and equipped with the devices electricity provides — for comfort, convenience and efficiency — they will not be content. They will have been trained in the colleges and universities of this country for the most efficient agricultural methods, and electricity will be a part of their lives.”

He understood that without modern infrastructure, Nebraska couldn’t keep its young people, modernize agriculture or grow its economy. Electricity was the thread connecting it all.

Today, the challenge is similar but bigger. Nebraska’s economic future is tied to powering the next generation of industries, many of which are rooted in agriculture. Gov. Jim Pillen’s “Silicon Valley of the bioeconomy” vision calls for transforming our crops into sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel, bioplastics, fertilizer, enzymes and other high-value products. These facilities will create new markets for farmers, jobs in rural communities and a larger state tax base.

But they will also demand vast amounts of electricity. Without new generation, transmission and grid capacity, we can’t fully realize that vision. And without deep community support for energy projects — including renewable energy facilities — the generation we need may never be built. This tension is as urgent as the conflicts in our communities over building sufficient housing to address our housing shortages and rising costs.

Nebraska’s energy demand is projected to grow nearly 20% over the next decade. In the last few years, demand projections have been revised upward annually. That’s from bioeconomy projects, information technology, advanced manufacturing and more. Our public power providers are planning and investing for growth. But local resistance to building energy projects can slow or stop development that is vital to meeting the state’s generation needs.

Here’s where the dots connect:

• Communities want rural jobs, tax revenue and revitalization.

• The bioeconomy, which creates domestic markets for domestic producers, needs abundant energy to operate, as do the advanced manufacturing facilities that anchor employment bases.

• Building renewable projects, transmission lines, natural gas turbines and the nuclear tech of tomorrow unlock demand and create the rural jobs, tax revenue and revitalization described above.

If the last dot is missing, the picture breaks apart. If we turn away wind, solar or other generation projects that want to locate here, we may inadvertently turn away the bioeconomy and manufacturing investments they help power.

The benefits of welcoming energy development are real and visible across Nebraska.

Nebraska’s nameplate capacity tax on renewables generates millions of dollars each year for schools, roads and other public services. Large projects diversify the local tax base, reduce reliance on property taxes and create a stable revenue stream communities can control.

Construction and operational jobs inject new spending into the local economy, and, in many cases, towns with a local option sales tax see millions in new revenue from major projects. Look at northeast Nebraska, where inviting generation has led to a flywheel of growth and revitalization in cities like Norfolk.

The Nebraska Chamber works alongside our public utilities, private developers, local leaders and the agricultural community. We believe in an “all-of-the-above” energy approach — not just because it’s good policy, but because it’s the only realistic way to connect the dots between Nebraska’s growth ambitions and the infrastructure needed to support them.

George Norris fought to bring electricity to every corner of Nebraska, because he knew it would change the trajectory of rural life. In our time, the fight is to ensure we have enough generation to keep our state competitive, our communities strong and opportunities here at home.

We grow it here. We can process it here. But only if we power it here. It won’t be easy. These emotional discussions invoke our sense of place, conservation and unfortunately in some instances, partisanship. I believe we can work together, connect the dots and make Nebraska’s next century as bright as the last.

As the flag carrier of Egypt and a proud Star Alliance member, EgyptAir has officially filed with the US Department of Transportation for approval to launch two groundbreaking long-haul routes in 2026. The first will connect Cairo International Airport (CAI) directly to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) starting in May 2026, marking the airline's longest flight to date at approximately 7,500 miles and over 15 hours of flight time. This non-stop service revives a historic link, as EgyptAir previously operated flights to Los Angeles decades ago, before suspending them amid shifting global aviation dynamics. Complementing this, a Cairo to Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD) route is slated to commence in June 2026, further solidifying EgyptAir's North American footprint. These new US routes from EgyptAir are not just additions to the schedule; they represent a strategic pivot toward enhanced global connectivity, catering to the surging demand for efficient travel between the Middle East and the West Coast and Midwest of the United States. With Egypt's tourism sector booming, drawing millions annually to its ancient wonders, and strong business ties fostering cargo and passenger growth, these initiatives align perfectly with broader economic goals. EgyptAir's leadership has emphasized that the routes will leverage the airline's modern fleet, including the incoming Airbus A350-900 aircraft, to deliver premium comfort on these extended journeys. Early indications suggest initial frequencies of three to four weekly flights per route, with potential for daily operations as demand stabilizes, offering travelers unparalleled convenience without layovers in Europe or the Gulf.

The operational backbone for these new EgyptAir US routes lies in the airline's ongoing fleet modernization, a multi-billion-dollar investment that positions it as a competitive force in long-haul aviation. Currently, EgyptAir's wide-body arsenal includes Boeing 777-300ERs, Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, and Airbus A330 variants, but the real game-changer arrives with the phased delivery of up to 15 Airbus A350-900s beginning in early 2026. These state-of-the-art jets, equipped with advanced aerodynamics for fuel efficiency and reduced emissions, boast spacious cabins featuring lie-flat business class seats, enhanced economy legroom, and cutting-edge in-flight entertainment systems. For the Cairo to Los Angeles flight, the A350's range exceeding 9,700 miles ensures seamless non-stop service, while its quieter engines and lower cabin altitude promise a less fatiguing experience for passengers crossing multiple time zones. Similarly, the Chicago route will benefit from this technology, allowing EgyptAir to optimize schedules around peak travel windows. Beyond passenger comfort, these aircraft support substantial cargo holds, vital for transporting Egyptian exports like textiles and perishables alongside US imports. EgyptAir's integration into Star Alliance amplifies the appeal, enabling seamless connections to over 1,300 destinations worldwide through partners like United Airlines and Lufthansa. This fleet upgrade isn't isolated; it's part of a comprehensive strategy that includes enhanced crew training and sustainability measures, such as sustainable aviation fuel trials, ensuring that new routes like Cairo to LAX and ORD adhere to global environmental standards while boosting operational reliability.

For travelers eyeing EgyptAir's new US routes, the benefits extend far beyond the flight itself, weaving into the rich tapestry of cultural and economic exchanges between Egypt and America. Imagine departing Cairo's bustling terminals at dawn, arriving in sun-drenched Los Angeles by evening to explore Hollywood's glamour or Silicon Beach's innovation hubs, all without the hassle of connections. Chicago-bound flights, meanwhile, open doors to the Windy City's architectural marvels, deep-dish pizza scenes, and proximity to the Great Lakes, appealing to leisure seekers and business professionals alike. These routes are poised to invigorate Egypt's inbound tourism, projected to surpass 15 million visitors in 2026, by making iconic sites like the Pyramids of Giza and the Nile River cruises more accessible from the US heartland and the Pacific Coast. Economically, they promise to channel increased trade volumes, with bilateral commerce already topping $10 billion annually, facilitated by streamlined visa processes and dedicated lounges at CAI. EgyptAir anticipates a diverse passenger mix: Egyptian-Americans visiting family, adventure tourists chasing pharaonic history, and corporate delegates sealing deals in emerging sectors like renewable energy. Safety remains paramount, with EgyptAir's flawless IATA Operational Safety Audit score underscoring its commitment to rigorous standards. As these services roll out, ancillary offerings like premium meal selections blending Mediterranean flavors with American classics will elevate the onboard journey, turning long-haul flights into memorable previews of destination cultures.

Looking ahead, EgyptAir's pursuit of these new US routes in May and June 2026 signals a new era of aviation ambition for the airline, potentially reshaping competitive landscapes in the transatlantic sphere. While rivals like Emirates and Qatar Airways dominate with vast Gulf hubs, EgyptAir's direct Cairo gateways offer shorter travel times and cost efficiencies, especially for East Coast and Midwest US departures.

Ltd., announced on October 1 that they have signed an agreement to explore a worldwide partnership, reports Biodiesel magazine.

Their goal is to solve a major problem in the industry: the difficult and inefficient process of getting sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, from producers to airplanes. Currently, mixing SAF with traditional fuel usually happens only at large production sites, which isn’t very flexible. Most fuel terminals and airports don’t have the right equipment or approvals for this mixing process.

Together, the companies plan to create a complete solution. They will combine XCF’s knowledge in building SAF production systems with FlyORO’s unique, portable blending technology, called AlphaLite. This system is designed to be set up either at airports or before fuel reaches them. The collaboration aims to make it easier and more cost-effective for airports and airlines to start using SAF.

The need for solutions like this is growing quickly. By 2030, the worldwide market for SAF is predicted to be worth more than $25 billion, with demand expected to be over 5.5 billion gallons. New and flexible mixing technologies will be essential to connect fuel producers with airports and airlines globally.

This potential partnership fits with XCF’s plan to expand internationally using a modular and efficient approach. Teaming up with FlyORO would help XCF offer a more complete service, managing everything from producing the fuel to blending and delivering it around the world.

Mihir Dange, the head of XCF Global, stated, “This partnership could change how the aviation industry approaches SAF. Blending is a crucial part of the process that affects how quickly SAF can be adopted. By combining FlyORO’s technology with our global strategy, we are building a way to speed up its use, lower costs, and create new opportunities for everyone involved.”

Damian Mc Loughlin, a leader at FlyORO, added, “Our goal has always been to remove the obstacles to using SAF. Our portable AlphaLite system makes blending more adaptable and affordable. By working with XCF, we can bring this solution to airports and airlines worldwide, enabling faster and smarter deployment of clean fuel.”

This agreement shows the companies’ shared commitment to making clean aviation fuel more widely used. The final partnership depends on further reviews and the signing of formal contracts.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/XCF-global-image-logo-updated.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 10:56:47.848057

This sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is a cleaner alternative to regular jet fuel.
Delhi was selected for this test because the Panipat refinery already supplies regular airplane fuel to the airport through a direct pipeline.
“The system they already have to make and deliver fuel to the airport can also be used for this new eco-friendly fuel.
It plans to mix 1% of this eco-friendly fuel with regular airplane fuel in 2027.","New Delhi: India will soon start a test program to supply a new type of eco-friendly airplane fuel at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, reports The Hindu businessline.

This sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is a cleaner alternative to regular jet fuel. It is made from renewable sources or waste materials. The Indian Oil Corporation has recently been approved to make this fuel at its refinery in Panipat.

The fuel will be created using materials like used cooking oil and farm waste such as rice straw. Delhi was selected for this test because the Panipat refinery already supplies regular airplane fuel to the airport through a direct pipeline.

A major benefit of this new fuel is that it can be used with existing airport equipment and fuel systems.

“The great thing about this fuel is that you don’t need to change any of the current equipment to start using it. It works just like regular fuel,” said Jane Hupe, a deputy director at the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN body.

She highlighted that India’s existing pipeline network is a significant advantage because it means no expensive new transportation systems are required.

“The system they already have to make and deliver fuel to the airport can also be used for this new eco-friendly fuel. That’s a major benefit,” Hupe added.

Globally, this kind of fuel is important for a UN plan to reduce pollution from international flights. This plan is being introduced in stages, and countries can choose to join voluntarily until 2026.

India has decided not to take part in these early voluntary phases. However, starting in 2027, Indian airlines operating international flights will need to follow the plan’s rules.

To prepare, the Indian government has set initial goals. It plans to mix 1% of this eco-friendly fuel with regular airplane fuel in 2027. This would increase to 2% in 2028 and reach 5% by 2030.

The government is also creating a full policy to encourage the production and use of this sustainable fuel.

Last month, India’s Civil Aviation Minister, K. Ram Mohan Naidu, stated that India has a natural edge in this area.

“Our location helps us become an exporter, and we also have huge amounts of raw materials available,” the Minister said.

Currently, India has more than 750 million tonnes of biomass and nearly 230 million tonnes of extra farm waste that can be used to produce this green fuel.

“India has the potential to become a world leader in making this fuel,” the Minister said. He added that India is expected to produce more of this fuel than it needs, allowing it to become a major supplier to other countries.

India already exports half of the regular airplane fuel it produces.

“It makes sense for us to focus on this, given our dedication to a cleaner environment,” he said.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SAF-01.jpeg,N,,2025-10-04 10:56:55.657360

The university co-organized the event alongside the Ministry of Energy Transition, IRESEN, Green H2 Cluster, and MASEN. UM6P participated through its subsidiary Green Energy Park (GEP) and its affiliated venture builder INNOVX, which operates HydroJeel, a green hydrogen and ammonia production company.

The university’s involvement in the summit reflects its end-to-end role in Morocco’s hydrogen ecosystem. UM6P runs physical platforms, including the Green H2A facility at Jorf Lasfar, a joint UM6P-IRESEN-OCP platform with 4 megawatts of electrolysis capacity producing 4 tons of green ammonia daily.

It also operates a micro-pilot system at the Green Energy Park in Benguerir, Morocco’s first installed green hydrogen production system.

The summit focused on bankability, offtake contracts, certification, and export readiness. Key sessions included a high-level plenary on securing offtake with H2Global and MASEN, and panels on decarbonizing aviation, shipping, and road transport.

Morocco has earmarked up to one million hectares of public land for green hydrogen projects, with five investors pre-selected in March 2025 for six projects worth approximately $31.9 billion.

Research and development drive Morocco’s energy transition

Hicham Lalaoui Moutarajji, Pedagogical Manager at UM6P’s Laboratory of Inorganic Materials for Sustainable Energy Technologies (LIMSET), told Morocco World News (MWN) that the university operates along two main axes: research and innovative projects addressing Morocco’s energy sovereignty.

“We work on innovative projects, carrying out R&D to find sustainable energy solutions that address Morocco’s energy sovereignty and ensure a flexible and efficient energy transition for both Morocco and Africa,” Lalaoui Moutarajji explained.

The laboratory translates research into practical applications. Its work covers green hydrogen, batteries for energy storage, and various industrial applications. These research outcomes feed directly into teaching programs designed for both junior professionals seeking upskilling and senior executives requiring specialized training.

“The essential goal is to guarantee this transfer of knowledge and expertise to future Moroccan generations, enabling them to meet both national and global challenges in this domain,” Lalaoui Moutarajji said.

UM6P’s research infrastructure includes partnerships with Argonne National Laboratory for collaboration on green energy technology and grids.

The university has signed agreements to run electrolyzer pilots with Chariot and Oort Energy on its campus. A recent memorandum with OCP SBU Mining and EDF aims to use green hydrogen for “green drying” and mobility trials at UM6P’s Mining ARC in Benguerir.

Co-founded by UM6P and IRESEN, the Green Energy Park serves as a testing ground for photovoltaics, storage systems, smart grids, and hydrogen applications. Research groups at UM6P have published work on alkaline hydrogen production systems and novel materials for electrochemical devices.

Published studies examine control of solar variability, thermal integration, and efficiency mapping in kilowatt-scale systems. UM6P’s ACER and LIMSET teams focus on materials and devices for hydrogen production and reversible electrochemical systems.

Executive training prepares workforce for hydrogen economy

The university offers an executive master’s degree in green hydrogen that has reached its third cohort. The twelve-month program covers the entire hydrogen value chain through intensive one-week sessions for each module. Participants engage in practical workshops, case studies, and sessions with international experts.

“This executive master’s runs over twelve months, structured around intensive one-week sessions for each module,” Lalaoui Moutarajji noted. The curriculum addresses fundamentals, emerging technologies, including SWAC, alkaline, PEM, and AEM electrolysis, along with energy storage challenges.

The program includes modules on safety, health, and security. “Integrating a safety module is essential – a key ingredient for the success of the program and for the concrete realization of hydrogen projects,” Lalaoui Moutarajji stated.

Project structuring and technical aspects of developing hydrogen facilities form another core component. The program draws participants from Morocco’s major industrial entities, including OCP, GESA, INNOVX, UM6P, and the Public Laboratory for Testing and Studies. The current cohort includes international professionals from Mauritania and Tunisia.

“Individuals recognized the value of enrolling in this unique executive master’s – the only one of its kind in Morocco and the Arab world – and who see its potential to contribute to success across the African continent,” Lalaoui Moutarajji said.

Training timelines align with Morocco’s industrial ambitions. An engineer requires five years of training to operate new hydrogen facilities. Programs at UM6P, Green Energy Park, and national academic partners prepare the workforce for units expected to become operational between 2027 and 2032.

The university’s approach combines theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience at pilot facilities. Students gain exposure to real-world challenges in hydrogen production, storage, and application across different industrial sectors.

Industrial decarbonization links CO₂ and hydrogen strategies

Abdelghafour Zaabout, Associate Professor at UM6P’s Applied Chemistry and Engineering Research (ACER) Center of Excellence, specializing in decarbonization technologies, described his work on hard-to-abate industries. He told MWN that the university prepares technologies respecting Morocco’s specific industrial context.

“At UM6P, we do several things basically that are linked to preparing first through training and education, but second as well through R&D development so that we can prepare the technologies that can lead the decarbonization,” Zaabout explained.

The connection between carbon capture and hydrogen production forms a central element of the strategy. Zaabout outlined how captured CO₂ from specific industries can combine with hydrogen to create green molecules.

“The CO₂ that has been captured from specific industries to decarbonize can be combined with the hydrogen to make green molecules,” he said.

This approach positions CO₂ as an enabler rather than merely a waste product. “The CO₂ is an enabler of the hydrogen economy,” Zaabout noted. The university works extensively on identifying which technologies suit Morocco’s hard-to-decarbonize industries.

UM6P trains chemical engineers and process engineers to understand fundamental mechanisms underlying these technologies. The educational philosophy emphasizes economic viability alongside technical feasibility.

“We create the mindset that they can understand that no technological development for solving specific challenges can be made unless those technologies create an economic value for society and impact for society itself,” Zaabout stated.

The university’s decarbonization work connects directly to OCP’s green investment program and ENGIE-OCP frameworks for renewables and green ammonia feasibility. UM6P and HydroJeel provide research, pilots, and talent development supporting these broader industrial initiatives.

Renewable energy competitiveness determines hydrogen viability

Mohamed Bousseta, CEO of Green Energy Park, stressed renewable energy’s role in hydrogen economics. Speaking to MWN, he explained that competitiveness drives the entire ecosystem’s success.

“Renewable energy accounts for 70% of competitiveness in green hydrogen production. In other words, to produce one kilogram of competitive green hydrogen, 70% of the cost comes from the LCOE – the levelized cost of energy,” Bousseta said.

Green Energy Park serves as a research, innovation, and training center for renewable energies, particularly photovoltaics, thermal and electrochemical storage, energy efficiency, smart grids, and modeling. The facility operates as a UM6P and IRESEN subsidiary.

Meanwhile, the Green H2A platform under construction at Jorf Lasfar will test new technologies at scale. The facility features 4 megawatts of electrolysis capacity split between 2 megawatts PEM and 2 megawatts alkaline systems. It will produce 4 tons of green ammonia daily.

“The platform will have emulators designed to test profiles specific to southern Morocco, where the majority of industrial projects will be implemented,” Bousseta explained. These emulators allow testing under conditions matching actual deployment sites.

Bousseta pointed out that demonstrators prove critical for ecosystem development. “Because if we want to successfully develop this ecosystem, competitiveness is absolutely key. Competitiveness means achieving a competitive price, and that requires innovation across all domains,” he said.

Innovation must span renewable energy generation, hydrogen production technologies, and applications. The process includes electrolysis for splitting water molecules, nitrogen production, and ammonia synthesis combining hydrogen and nitrogen.

From pilots to industrial scale through venture building

UM6P’s approach extends beyond traditional academic boundaries into venture creation and industrial scale-up. INNOVX, the university’s affiliated venture builder, established HydroJeel specifically to execute green hydrogen and ammonia projects for OCP and export markets.

Operated by HydroJeel, the Jorf Hydrogen Platform targets 100,000 tons per year of green ammonia in its first phase. The project received a €30 million grant from Germany’s PtX Development Fund, administered by KfW and KGAL, to advance the demonstrator.

Morocco’s “Morocco Offer” policy framework, launched in March 2024, provides up to one million hectares of public land for hydrogen projects. The first 300,000 hectares entered active development. In March 2025, the steering committee pre-selected five investors for six projects valued at 319 billion dirhams across three southern regions.

Projects span green ammonia, e-fuels, and green steel production. TotalEnergies studies a 200,000-ton-per-year green ammonia export project near Guelmim-Oued Noun. OCP and ENGIE signed a multi-billion-euro memorandum covering renewables, green molecules, and desalination.

Tarfaya represents a scaling pathway with renewable ammonia production targeting approximately one million tons per year by 2027, expanding to three million tons by 2032. The project obtained renewable fuels of non-biological origin pre-certification, positioning it for European Union market access.

UM6P’s Green H2A facility partners with Proton Ventures of the Netherlands for turnkey pilot installation. The dual electrolyzer configuration with renewable load emulation creates a world-reference pilot setup. The system allows testing under variable solar and wind profiles matching southern Morocco conditions.

Process-use cases focus on mining applications where OCP operations provide immediate demand. Green hydrogen can replace fossil fuels for drying processes and mobile equipment. These anchor applications address the critical challenge of securing customers before production begins.

Strategic partnerships accelerate technology transfer and scale

International partnerships strengthen UM6P’s capabilities across the hydrogen value chain. The university signed a memorandum with 247Solar to study green hydrogen and ammonia production pathways linked to solar thermal and power platforms.

Partnerships with equipment manufacturers bring cutting-edge technology to Moroccan soil. Electrolyzer pilots with Chariot and Oort Energy allow testing of different system architectures under local conditions. The OCP SBU Mining partnership with EDF demonstrates process integration in industrial settings.

The Argonne National Laboratory collaboration provides access to high-performance computing, advanced materials research, and systems integration expertise. This connection accelerates the translation from laboratory research to operational plants.

Morocco’s geographic position supports export-oriented projects. Ports including Jorf Lasfar, Dakhla, and facilities near Guelmim offer Atlantic access to European and global markets. Summit discussions on port readiness and export corridors included Port of Rotterdam participation, signaling concrete logistics planning.

Since its establishment in 2024, Germany’s climate and energy alliance with Morocco positions the kingdom as a key supplier for European hydrogen demand. This framework provides policy backing for long-term offtake agreements and project financing.

The summit’s focus on certification and traceability reflects market requirements. INNOVX and Hinicio run Moroccan pilots for renewable fuels of non-biological origin certification. MED-GEM, an EU-funded initiative, coordinates pre-certification work essential for accessing European incentives and sustainable aviation fuel mandates.

Water supply through desalination co-located with renewable energy installations addresses a critical input. OCP and ENGIE plans integrate agricultural water needs with molecule production. Summit sessions examined water-energy nexus solutions.

Morocco’s hydrogen strategy targets replacing imported ammonia for fertilizers while creating export capacity. Green ammonia serves as both an industrial feedstock and a maritime fuel.

E-methanol and sustainable aviation fuel address shipping and aviation decarbonization. Early green steel projects leverage Morocco’s industrial base and respond to the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) dynamics.

UM6P’s comprehensive model combines scientific research, pilot-scale validation, workforce development, and venture creation. This integrated approach addresses the full spectrum of requirements for establishing a hydrogen economy.

The university’s platforms provide technology de-risking, operator training, and pathway validation from concept through commercial scale.",https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/UM6P-Takes-Center-Stage-at-Power-to-X-Summit-in-Marrakech.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 10:57:01.228353

Dr Ahmad Parveez said these efforts are critical to counteract negative campaigns in key export markets and assure buyers that Malaysian palm oil meets climate-conscious demands.

He also called for greater fiscal support to accelerate the growth of downstream sectors, including oleochemicals, specialty fats, bioenergy, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which he described as key to ensuring long-term resilience.

“We urge more strategic support for logistics efficiency, including incentives for greener and lower-cost export solutions,” he added, noting that such efforts would address both current cost pressures and long-term positioning in global markets.

On improving yields, he proposed a 100 per cent reinvestment allowance (RA) for oil palm replanting to accelerate the replacement of ageing trees. “This initiative is expected to increase the oil palm replanting rate from 2.5 per cent, or 101,809 hectares, to 5.1 per cent, or 210,000 hectares annually.”

He called for RM280 million in dedicated funding under Budget 2026 to support replanting programmes for independent smallholders. “Recognising the urgent need to rejuvenate ageing plantations, the government remains committed to supporting independent smallholders,” he said.

A further RM100 million soft loan scheme was proposed to support small and medium-sized estates in undertaking replanting without undue financial strain. “In the medium to long term, this initiative will boost national crude palm oil (CPO) production through higher-yielding varieties and improved farm management.”

Dr Ahmad Parveez also recommended imposing a three per cent export duty on refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm stearin to ensure sufficient domestic supply for the oleochemical sector, alongside a 10–20 per cent duty on the export of waste oils, such as used cooking oil (UCO) and palm oil mill effluent (POME oil), to promote local utilisation.

“These measures would support local production, encourage compliance with sustainability certification schemes such as MSPO and the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), and help transition the sector towards a circular, greener economy.”

He said Budget 2026 presents a timely opportunity to help the sector overcome external challenges, from trade restrictions to labour shortages, while strengthening its long-term productivity and market resilience.

“The focus should be on strengthening sustainability compliance through universal MSPO adoption and robust traceability systems,” he added. “Compliance with global environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards is vital to safeguard Malaysia’s position in international markets. Incentives for mechanisation, digitalisation and precision agriculture would further help reduce reliance on manual labour and improve operational efficiency.”

Alongside automotive and other industries, it has positioned Mexico as a global manufacturing powerhouse. But the era of industries operating in silos is ending. Driven by megatrends such as decarbonization, electrification, artificial intelligence, and supply chain resilience, the boundaries between sectors are dissolving.

In fact, this convergence is not only a global phenomenon, but it also represents one of Mexico’s greatest opportunities. By embracing cross-industry synergies, the country can move from being an assembler of global supply chains to becoming a true designer of innovation. The challenge is no longer whether these industries will intersect, but how Mexico can leverage their overlap to shape the future of mobility.

Aerospace and Automotive: Shared roads to Electrification and Autonomy

Few countries combine a robust aerospace presence with an equally strong automotive base. Mexico does both. Some regions in our country have become hubs for advanced aerospace engineering and manufacturing, while other regions anchor the automotive supply chain.

The parallels are striking. The automotive industry’s leap into electric vehicles and batteries offers valuable lessons for aerospace: Hybrid-Electric aircraft, eVTOLs, and Advanced Urban Air Mobility will depend on many of the same technologies. Lightweight materials and composites pioneered in car design are equally critical for next-generation aircraft. Similarly, autonomous driving systems share DNA with AI-driven flight safety and air traffic control.

If Mexico aligns its supply chains and innovation agendas, it could lead in developing the integrated mobility solutions of the future, in other words, where wings meet the wheels.

Aerospace and Energy: Powering the future of Sustainable Flight

The energy transition is rewriting the rules of the aerospace industry. Decarbonization requires breakthroughs in sustainable aviation fuels, hydrogen propulsion, and new infrastructure. Here, Mexico’s energy landscape offers untapped potential.

Solar projects in the state of Sonora, and wind corridors in the state of Oaxaca could power the production of green hydrogen in Mexico, which will be as important for aviation as it will be for other transportation modes.

Mexico’s agricultural and petrochemical base could support SAF production, turning the country into a potential hub for clean aviation fuels. Airports themselves could evolve into microgrids that supply renewable energy to aircraft and surrounding cities.

Partnerships between the government, global energy firms, and Mexico’s airlines and MRO networks could unlock synergies that accelerate sustainable aviation across the Latin America region.

Aerospace and Digital: AI, Data, and Industry 4.0

The digital revolution is blurring the boundaries between aerospace and other industries. Predictive maintenance, and AI-enabled systems are already transforming how fleets are operated and maintained.

Mexico’s IT hubs like Guadalajara, Monterrey and Mexico City provide a talent base that can bridge aerospace with other adjacent industries. Cybersecurity lessons from financial services can protect aircraft systems, Big Data and Analytics can optimize flight operations as much as they improve medical diagnostics.

This digital layer represents a great opportunity for Mexico to position itself not just as a manufacturing powerhouse, but as a designer of integrated, AI-driven mobility systems.

The Role of Industry Clusters: Living Labs for Synergies and Experimentation

Mexico’s industry clusters would be at the heart of this transformation.

To unlock synergies, these clusters must evolve from isolated centers of excellence into interconnected living labs where industries converge.

Clusters also play a vital role in workforce development. By aligning their educational programs, technical institutes, and research centers, they can build cross-sector talent pipelines that prepare engineers and technicians to work at the intersection of aerospace, automotive, and energy. In this way, clusters can act as catalysts for Mexico’s evolution from assembler to innovator.

Caveats and Conditions: Turning vision into reality

The opportunities above are real, but so are the challenges. For our country to transform potential into real leadership, several conditions must be addressed:

Energy policy alignment: Investors in renewables, SAF, and hydrogen need long-term clarity. Establishing clear incentives and stable regulatory frameworks will be key to unlocking the full potential of Mexico’s diverse energy resources.

Infrastructure modernization: Today’s refineries, electricity grids, and logistics networks are not prepared for large-scale SAF production or hydrogen distribution. Airports aspiring to become renewable microgrids also face significant challenges. A national plan for modernization is needed to align physical infrastructure with the innovation agenda.

R&D and IP protection: Mexico needs to increase investment in applied research, ensuring strong intellectual property frameworks, so that innovations developed locally generate local value. Protecting and commercializing locally developed IP, while aligning programs such as the National System of Researchers (SNI) with industrial priorities is critical.

Cross-industry governance: Isolated pilot projects are not enough. Mexico requires permanent mechanisms for collaboration among clusters, government agencies, academia, and industry. These governance platforms would ensure synergies move from isolated efforts to coordinated national strategies.

Talent development: Universities and technical institutes are producing strong engineers, but curricula remain industry specific. To lead in converging fields like electrified propulsion, AI-enabled mobility, and hydrogen systems, Mexico needs accelerated programs that cut across multiple industries.

Without these critical enablers, the vision of Mexico as a cross-industry innovation hub will remain aspirational. With them, it becomes a realistic path to competitiveness.

The industries of the future will not succeed in isolation. Industries like Aerospace, Automotive, and Digital are converging into a single innovation frontier, and Mexico is well positioned in all of them.

What Mexico needs now is the discipline to align policies, modernize infrastructure, accelerate talent, and institutionalize cross-industry collaboration. If these conditions are met, Mexico will not just assemble the technologies of tomorrow—it will design them, integrate them, and export them to the world.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/pictures/2025-03/GE-Infrastructure-Queretaro-IMG-2021-Alberto-Robles-1-apd-MBN.jpg?h=aa4588f2&itok=HTLWHtIx,N,,2025-10-04 10:57:24.344417

US-based startup Otto Aerospace is behind the Jetsons-like plane, called the Phantom 3500. It features a teardrop-shaped fuselage that significantly reduces fuel consumption and increases range, as well as screens in place of traditional windows.

Its first flight is scheduled for 2027, with delivery expected in 2030.

There is one caveat: this is an all-new, clean-sheet aircraft type that has yet to be built and certified. The question of whether it delivers on time remains uncertain, as new concepts often take longer than initially planned.

Still, Flexjet CEO Michael Silvestro told Business Insider that while development hurdles are possible, the company is fully committed to innovation and is seeking manufacturers willing to move the needle in ways the industry has not yet seen.

""Otto impressed us. The technology is incredibly efficient and very capable in terms of size, speed range, comfort, fuel flow, and sustainability, so why not?"" he said. ""Why not think about continuing to push the envelope on the latest technological advances in aviation?""

The move comes as the private aviation industry continues to boom post-pandemic, with more and more people — particularly young professionals in their 40s — flocking to the luxuries of business aviation.

Yes, there are no windows

Besides the cockpit, the new nine-seater Phantom 3500 will be windowless. Instead, large screens will blanket the passenger cabin walls and ceiling.

Silvestro said these ""smart windows"" are designed to do several things, such as imitating what's going on outside or creating your own virtual images. He added that the goal is that clients could put anything they want on the screen — including movies or videos.

Getting rid of the windows helps smooth out the fuselage, reducing drag and fuel burn. Silvestro said Otto will have to figure out the logistics of seeing outside the aircraft during emergency events, like an engine fire.

""Now we have cameras everywhere on the airplanes, on the larger ones in particular, so there would have to be a pretty robust video ability to see what's going on outside,"" he said.

Despite potential deterrents like claustrophobia, Silvestro said he expects the revolutionary design to attract clients in the long term.

However, he said Flexjet's younger and more technically advanced customers, who are more open to change, would be the early adopters.

""It's just like anything else, like Waymo is going everywhere,"" he said as an example of other futuristic innovations. ""I think as you get a little bit more comfortable with technology, that unnerves people, and it will become more of the norm.""

The futuristic tech comes as more young people fly private

Flexjet's bet on Otto comes as Silvestro pointed to an increase in young people flying private. This demographic is particularly more inclined to welcome futuristic tech like the Phantom 3500.

""The demographic is trending so much younger than it used to be,"" he said. ""We're capturing a good 10 years' worth of flyers; people in their 40s who can afford this are all in with regard to flying privately, and fractional ownership is the most desirable part.""

Once in service, the Phantom 3500 will become part of Flexjet's popular and ever-growing ""fractional ownership"" program.

This allows high-net-worth clients to enjoy the luxury and privacy of a private jet without owning one outright. Instead, they share one by purchasing flight hours.

It's essentially a timeshare for private flying and has become an increasingly attractive way to travel as billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Taylor Swift continue to battle jet trackers.

Data from Aviation Week's aircraft tracking tool indicates that the program is being used more than ever, with fractional ownership increasing by 10% between June and August compared to the same period in 2024, and by 70% compared to the same period in 2019.

What else does Flexjet get for $19.5 million

The Phantom 3500 is being developed as a super-midsized jet, competing with similar-sized planes such as the Bombardier Challenger 350 or the Embraer Praetor 600.

These jets typically have a cabin length of 23 to 28 feet and can seat eight to 10 passengers, depending on the configuration.

However, with a list price of $19.5 million, the Phantom 3500 is less expensive. The Bombardier and Embraer — both of which Flexjet already flies — cost about $27 million and $24 million new, respectively.

Otto's cost savings come from the plane's ""laminar-flow"" technology, which reduces drag by maintaining smoother airflow across the aircraft's carbon fiber composite surface. Otto said this would result in a 60% lower fuel burn than a comparable jet.

And smaller fuel tanks allow for smaller wings and engines, which also helps save on production and maintenance costs, per Otto.

Furthermore, the Phantom 3500 is designed to cruise at altitudes of up to 51,000 feet. This would allow it to fly above weather and turbulence, further reduce fuel consumption, and offer increased route flexibility. US airlines, by contrast, cruise at altitudes of up to 42,000 feet.

Overall, Otto said the jet would reduce operating costs by 50% and offer an expected range of 3,500 nautical miles (about 4,000 miles). That could connect Los Angeles and Hawaii or New York and London.

Otto already tested the laminar technology on a full-scale, piloted demonstrator jet called the Celera 500 for three years, starting in 2017. The company said the data collected proved the concept and projected savings.",https://i.insider.com/68ded8ac1c1f80efbec4d0a7?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-10-04 10:57:28.423068

Consolidated U.S. TMC: BCD (2025 move to Kayak BTX)

Big changes were underway for consulting giant Deloitte's travel program in 2024. An extensive travel agency request for proposal conducted for the U.S. program resulted by the beginning of 2025 in moving the U.S. firm to Kayak BTX, a TMC and booking tool collaboration between blockchain-based travel tech startup Blockskye and Kayak's enterprise grade booking platform.

The move took a massive piece of Deloitte's business away from BCD Travel, which had served the consulting firm globally for more than two decades and moved the U.S. firm off GetThere as a booking tool, though 2024 air spend went through the prior TMC and booking tool. BCD continues to serve the broader Deloitte account in more than two dozen other geographies.

The consulting giant maintained its No. 2 spot on this year's Corporate Travel 100 list, despite its U.S.-originating air travel volume dropping slightly from $300 million in 2023 to $295 million in 2024. The company projects, however, that it will have a considerable rebound in U.S. air volume next year—up to $325 million.

Because Kayak BTX brings new technology models and supplier payment mechanisms into play, it's conceivable other changes could be on the way for Deloitte's U.S. travel program. In the meantime, the firm made no updates to travel policy in 2024.

Deloitte did have other developments in 2024.

Consolidated Global TMC: Amex GBT

BTN estimates consulting firm McKinsey & Co. reached $228 million in U.S.-originating air spend, up considerably from 2024. The New York-based concern focused part of its travel management energy in 2024 on creating new artificial intelligence-driven processes for travelers, integrating large language model-based booking interface Skylink into existing Slack-based workflows. BTN named McKinsey director of travel and events technology Jamie Stewart as Travel Manager of the Year for his work on the project, which required buy-in from long-time travel management company partner American Express Global Business Travel to collaborate with a startup to achieve success.

Skylink users have seen their average booking times reduced to under two minutes from around 12 minutes previously. This includes an intuitive process for booking recurring trips in one AI-driven conversation rather than as separate itineraries in a booking tool. The firm still uses human agents at Amex GBT, and Concur serves as its legacy booking tool, but according to a company case study, more than 20 percent of bookings are now made through the Skylink AI interface, with 95 percent of users giving the tools a positive rating for experience and 85 percent becoming repeat users.

McKinsey is using the new interface to drive compliant bookings as well, whether that’s a nudge to book the roundtrip international fare or possibly to take a train instead of a flight, if the option is available—that latter nudge will be rolling out in a new Skylink implementation in the U.K. in the coming weeks. Right now, the tool is balanced to provide convenient, in-policy itineraries tailored to the individual traveler, and 85 percent of users are choosing among the first three options presented.

McKinsey additionally has been intent on lowering its carbon emissions from business travel. In addition to supporting remote and hybrid working models, strategic local staffing, web-based and localized recruiting and learning events, and initiatives that encourage colleagues to use rail travel and electric ground transportation when possible, the firm introduced a carbon fee for air bookings in 2023. The firm expanded those fees to accommodations in 2024 and mentioned in its annual sustainability report that the firm would be raising the fee over time.

With these measures in place, McKinsey achieved in 2024 a 50 percent reduction in air and ground travel-related emissions (this includes reductions as a result of purchasing sustainable aviation fuel and offsets).

The carbon fee, which is $50 per ton of CO2 equivalent emissions, funds offset purchases and SAF as part of an overall reduction strategy. The firm achieved 50 percent emissions reduction per full-time employee in 2024, beyond its 35 percent per FTE target.

McKinsey is looking to improve its offset purchasing strategies in the coming years—moving to 100 percent carbon removal projects by 2030.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/BTN/uploadedImages/2015_Site_Maintenance/BTN_Link_PreviewLogo.png?n=3260&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-10-03 20:58:10.246378

Oxxo, the Mexican convenience store chain with more than 24,000 locations across Latin America, underscored sustainability as a driver of business growth. “We are convinced that sustainability makes us a stronger and better business,” said Abraham Garza Álvarez, Oxxo’s sustainability manager.

Garza explained that modern Oxxo stores consume 40% less energy than those built 15 years ago, despite using nearly twice the equipment. The chain has implemented 29 energy-efficiency measures, including optimized lighting and refrigeration. More than 90% of its purchases come from local suppliers, who also benefit from training programs to enhance environmental, social, and economic practices. Oxxo recycles 30% of store waste and 80% of service center material, working with more than 50 partners.

The company is also testing sustainable mobility with 170 electric vehicles and pilot programs for electric trucks. By 2030, Oxxo aims to reduce emissions by 45%, source 85% of its energy from renewables, and lower supplier carbon footprints.

JAC Motors

Chinese automaker JAC Motors, which operates a plant in Ciudad Sahagún, Hidalgo, is expanding its electric and hybrid vehicle portfolio in Mexico. Its offerings range from family cars to last-mile delivery units, with technicians trained in high-voltage systems.

Vania Terrones, JAC’s EV manager, announced that the company will add a new production line dedicated to electric and hybrid vehicles, increasing capacity by 12,000 units per year. The facility will partially run on solar energy and create more than 500 green jobs. JAC also plans to promote adoption through “green rates,” offering more accessible financing for EV buyers.

Aeroméxico

Aeroméxico reaffirmed its target of net-zero emissions by 2050, supported by fleet renewal and efficiency measures. “Our aircraft are 20% more efficient than they were a few years ago,” said Karen Farías, director of sustainability and ESG.

The airline is training pilots to optimize fuel usage in every phase of flight and reducing auxiliary engine reliance on the ground. It is also developing a roadmap for producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Mexico, with Farías stressing the need for collaboration across government, industry partners, and consumers.

KIO IT Services

Tech firm KIO IT Services highlighted artificial intelligence as a tool for reducing emissions and boosting competitiveness. “Some logistics clients are already using hybrid or electric vehicles with AI-powered route optimization,” said José Da Silva, director of digital experience. He cited cases where delivery distances dropped from 100 to 20 kilometers, cutting energy use.

Da Silva referenced McKinsey research showing that one-third of companies worldwide have adopted AI into their business model. He added that KIO is expanding pilot projects while ensuring its data centers rely on renewable sources like solar, hydro, and geothermal energy.

According to EIA, biofuel production and consumption in the U.S. has generally increased each year since the early 1980s.
“There’s plenty of corn in the U.S.,” Fatka explains.
“When oil is really expensive, it’s easier to promote biofuels as an economic alternative to high oil prices,” Fatka observes.
She also notes a shift in SAF production could have an impact on the food sector and food prices, and conversations about this tradeoff are ongoing within the industry.","In a Sept. 17 edition of the North American Ag Spotlight podcast, hosted by Chrissy Wozniack, CoBank Farm Supply and Biofuels Lead Economist Jacqui Fatka offers her perspective on the shifting landscape of biofuels.

Titled “How Biofuels are Changing Opportunities for U.S. Producers,” the episode features a conversation on the current state of the biofuel industry and explores the potential impacts increased demand for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) may have on feedstock markets and, consequently, U.S. farmers.

Background on biofuels

Biofuels are renewable energy sources derived from biomass materials called feedstocks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Biomass materials include crop waste, forest residue, microalgae and food waste.

The most common types of biofuels used today are ethanol and biodiesel, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Ethanol production involves the fermentation of feedstocks like corn, sorghum, barley, sugar cane and sugarbeets, while biodiesel is produced by combining alcohol with vegetable oil, animal fat or recycled cooking grease.

According to EIA, biofuel production and consumption in the U.S. has generally increased each year since the early 1980s. As demand for biofuels continues to rise and research and development progresses, producers have the opportunity to take advantage of the changing landscape, but they must also be equipped to navigate challenges.

“With pressure growing around renewable energy and the rapid development of sustainable aviation fuels, producers and agribusinesses are facing new challenges and opportunities in feedstocks, investments and policy,” Wozniack begins.

She then introduces Fatka, who offers comments informed by “two decades of experience in ag policy, biofuels, trade and farm management.”

Highlights from Fatka’s comments include details on biofuel research and development, as well as how the demand for SAF might influence corn and soy production in the U.S.

She also gives advice on how producers can stay educated and protected in the face of shifting markets.

Sustainable aviation fuels

World Energy defines SAF as jet fuels made from materials like used cooking oils and agricultural waste.

In the podcast, Fatka notes most SAFs in the U.S. are produced through the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) process, which uses hydrogen to turn agricultural products like soybeans and canola oil – as well as waste oils and animal fats like beef tallow – into fuel.

Fatka further mentions hope for employing an “alcohol-to-jet” production process in greater quantities, which would use feedstocks similar to those found in ethanol production to make SAFs and, therefore, create benefits for farmers.

However, Fatka notes development is still ongoing and the process is expensive.

“There’s plenty of corn in the U.S.,” Fatka explains. “Being able to get feedstocks is not a problem, but the cost of alcohol-to-jet production for sustainable aviation fuel is much more expensive.”

“This is why we haven’t seen a lot of plants be able to scale commercially yet,” Fatka continues. “The important part is being able to make investments to drive costs down and make alcohol-to-jet production more cost competitive.”

Additionally, Fatka says lower global oil prices have led to challenges in sourcing investment in biofuel research and development and notes the U.S. is currently “a drop in the bucket” in terms of worldwide SAF use and domestic production.

“When oil is really expensive, it’s easier to promote biofuels as an economic alternative to high oil prices,” Fatka observes. “Oil prices are really low right now, so it’s hard to spin the need to invest in research and development.”

In terms of the big picture, Fatka says the future of domestic SAF production will depend on economic factors including tax incentives.

“SAF is not something you can turn on production of overnight,” Fatka says. “Unfortunately, we’re still years out. Without some of the policy levers to encourage things from the different tax incentives, we’re just not really going to see this truly take off.”

Furthermore, Fatka acknowledges some states including Minnesota and Illinois are trying to encourage SAF development to use at a local level, even without federal support.

“We’re still really early in this industry, and I think we have a lot to learn,” Fatka continues. “Some things we think we know now are going to change, but this also makes it really exciting. There are new things happening and new partnerships coming together.”

Staying informed

In the face of a shifting landscape, Fatka emphasizes keeping an ongoing dialogue with different players throughout the supply chain is important to remaining educated and prepared.

When asked about the potential for SAF adoption to change demand for traditional feedstocks like corn and soy, Fatka predicts a potential increase in demand for soybean oil, as well as any feedstock able to be run efficiently with a low carbon input score.

Fatka emphasizes there are many nuances to the biofuel market and research is constantly ongoing. She also notes a shift in SAF production could have an impact on the food sector and food prices, and conversations about this tradeoff are ongoing within the industry.

“This is one of those issues that is moving and changing a lot,” Fatka says. “There is a lot of hype and hope when it comes to SAF, but we have to be able to have a good, grounded understanding of what’s needed today.”

Overall, Fatka recommends farmers stay engaged with commodity groups and capture data on personal farming practices to remain educated and economically sustainable.

“If we keep pushing off investment, it’s going to keep pushing off return,” Fatka says. “We can’t capture any value if we’re not researching it now, figuring out what works and what doesn’t and maybe using different policy levers to help advocate for what’s needed.”

That may seem like science fiction, but the Pentagon’s naval research lab thinks shipboard fuel synthesis could be possible and is providing research and development funds to explore operationalising the technology.

If proven effective, the seawater-to-fuel conversion process could streamline naval logistics and unlock significant new tactical and strategic possibilities for Washington.

Consider a scenario in the not-so-distant future where one of the US Navy’s aircraft carriers is hiding deep in the vast expanse that is the western Pacific Ocean.

The flattop ship and its escorts have been forced far out to sea by the threat of long-range Chinese missiles, backed by orbital and airborne reconnaissance assets, which began hunting the carrier strike group after Beijing ordered a maritime quarantine of Taiwan.

Ships and aircraft for the People’s Liberation Army, bristling with anti-ship missiles, now ring the besieged island.

Although the US carrier is still generating sorties to probe the Chinese defences while Washington mulls a response, the strike group has been forced more than 1,000nm (1,852km) to remain safe from China’s vast arsenal of “carrier killer” weapons – including YJ-12 air-launched anti-ship missiles and shore-based anti-ship ballistic missiles, including the DF-21D and DF-26.

That latter category carriers a range beyond 2,000nm.

As a result of the stand-off, the carrier’s embarked air wing is forced to fly long-range sorties, with each aircraft refuelling multiple times per flight. Onboard stores of JP-5 jet fuel are being depleted, but the one-star admiral in command of the strike group is reluctant to rendezvous with one of the navy replenishment ships steaming across the Pacific – presumably under watch from Chinese reconnaissance satellites.

Instead, the strike group commander orders the captain of the carrier to fire up an experimental onboard generator, one that can produce fuel from the surrounding ocean water.

The navy thinks the concept holds enough promise that it is funding development of a maritime fuel production system that could be deployed aboard combat ships.

In August, the service issued a $9.4 million contract to a Texas-based company experimenting with a process that pulls carbon dioxide and hydrogen from seawater to synthesise jet fuel.

That firm, called Sea Dragon Energy, says that ocean water contains carbon dioxide in concentrations roughly 140 times that of air. Water is comprised of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen.

Under an initiative called Project Genesis, Sea Dragon is developing a system that could pull those raw material from seawater and convert them into a fuel equivalent to JP-5 – a process roughly analogous to the refining of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from agriculture products.

“The ability to do this in an efficient manner is precisely what Project Genesis is aiming to do,” Sea Dragon notes.

The company notes that the US Naval Research Laboratory has already patented technology that allows extraction of carbon dioxide from seawater and simultaneously produce hydrogen.

The goal now is to integrate that extraction process with a SAF production plant that is appropriately sized and efficient enough for shipboard operation.

“Preliminary studies of naval operational scenarios and naval architectural design suggest that a seaborne version of the process could sustain a carrier strike group’s operations indefinitely,” Sea Dragon notes.

“This ability is a huge advantage for the navy in a potential conflict situation,” the company adds.

Efficiency will be key to making the process viable in any real-world context. A 2014 report in Smithsonian Magazine noted the technology available at the time would require nearly 9 million cb m (318 million cb ft) of water to make 378,541 litres (100,000 USgal) of fuel – assuming 100% efficiency in the extraction and refining process.

Even outside an active conflict, Sea Dragon says the technology could reduce fuel and operating costs for the navy, while providing the service more flexibility and a reliable fuel supply.

The Pentagon famously converted its aircraft carrier fleet to nuclear propulsion when it commissioned the USS Enterprise – the world’s first nuclear-powered carrier – in 1965.

Nuclear reactors are standard on all of the currently-serving Nimitz-class carriers, which entered service in the 1970s, and the new Ford-class flattops – the first of which is now actiely generating sorties on the global frontlines.

While those floating airfields must still take on consumables, each carrier effectively has unlimited range and ample onboard power generation for functions like generation of fresh water via desalination.

An onboard jet fuel production capability could unlock a similar future for air wing operations, bound only by availability of spare parts and physical requirements of human crews.

Sea Dragon’s latest contract follows an even larger $19 million award from the navy in 2024 to design and build a seawater-to-jet fuel demonstrator unit.

Work on phase two of the project, which is funded by contract from August, will take place in San Diego over a two-year period, concluding in 2027.

That date notably coincides with the window after which senior US military and intelligence officials say Chinese premier Xi Jinping has ordered the PLA to be ready to seize Taiwan, should he give the go-ahead.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/0/4/1/113041_ussharrystrumanfa18fuellingcusnavy_393840.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 15:56:54.281769

Montréal, 3 October 2025 — The International Civil Aviation Organization Assembly has accelerated aviation’s transition to a more sustainable and decarbonized future by achieving broader global cooperation, strengthening the international framework, and laying the groundwork for increased investment.

The decisions made by the Assembly directly support the implementation of ICAO’s Strategic Plan for 2050. This long-term plan aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions from international air transport, building on a Resolution adopted by States at the 2022 Assembly session.

Key outcomes of the Assembly include:

Commitment to cleaner energy, with States endorsing the ICAO Global Framework for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels, and other cleaner energy sources. This includes endorsement of the Framework’s collective target of 5% CO₂ reduction by 2030 and the policy, regulation, support, and financing pathway it provides for achieving it.

Accelerated investment, with the Assembly calling for the full operationalization of the ICAO Finvest Hub. This Hub will connect decarbonization projects with public and private investors. It aims to address financing challenges, particularly in developing countries, by facilitating greater access to climate finance.

Strengthened commitment to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), the world’s only global market-based measure for international aviation. The Assembly reaffirmed the scheme’s environmental integrity and committed to increasing support to States through the ACT-CORSIA programme. CORSIA is on track and continues to progress with enhanced participation and expanded coverage.

Sustainability beyond carbon, with the Assembly advancing work on issues including aircraft noise, local air quality, single-use plastics, and non-CO₂ climate effects.

Enhanced resilience and accelerated adaptation, with States acknowledging the urgent need for stronger scientific input, strengthened international cooperation, and updated guidance on climate risk assessment and infrastructure resilience to adapt aviation infrastructure and operations to climate-related impacts. States also recognized the role of aviation in disaster response, such as forest firefighting operations.

The decisions taken by the Assembly will provide crucial momentum to real and measurable progress led by ICAO on environmental sustainability. This progress is demonstrated by increasing numbers of States submitting Action Plans on CO2 Emissions Reduction Activities (154, up from 133 in 2022), increasing voluntary participation in CORSIA (now 130 States), and a growing number of sustainable aviation fuel plants worldwide.

The broader participation and stronger commitments of these Resolutions also send a resounding signal to governments, industry, and investors alike: the global aviation community is united and determined to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Of the identified emissions cuts needed for carbon neutrality, 70% rely on sustainable aviation fuels, or SAF.
We’re not going to get to net zero by 2050.” More measured voices among SAF’s champions also have concerns.
He admitted last week to disappointment in progress, adding he did “not believe that target can be achieved given where we are in terms of SAF production”.
IAG says there will be enough SAF to meet EU and UK mandates until 2030.","One hundred years ago, the Italian aviator Francesco de Pinedo was attempting the unprecedented feat of crossing the Indian subcontinent in a flying boat. He later splashed down on the Tiber in Rome to national acclaim, having flown via Asia to Australia and back over seven months, taking off and landing in water 80 times.

Aviation has been marked by stop-start journeys on hitherto uncharted courses to unlikely, if not unreachable, destinations. Today’s collective act of faith – amid much scepticism – is in following an uncertain path to sustainability, through green fuels that are yet to be widely produced.

Most in the aviation industry, even if only through self-interest, are on board with the theory. Of the identified emissions cuts needed for carbon neutrality, 70% rely on sustainable aviation fuels, or SAF. “Without it,” says Tim Alderslade, of Airlines UK, “we cannot get anywhere near net zero by 2050.”

This year, the first steps were imposed by mandate in the EU and the UK, requiring 2% of jet fuel to be sustainable – by 2030, that reaches 6% in the EU and 10% in Britain.

However, airlines have questioned whether supplies will be available and at what price. A fissure is developing between those that have secured sources of SAF and invested in technologies, and others with a ferocious eye on the bottom line.

Michael O’Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, dismisses SAF as nonsense. He says: “It is all gradually dying a death, which is what it deserves to do. We have just about met our 2% mandate. There is no possibility of meeting 6% by 2030; 10%, not a hope in hell. We’re not going to get to net zero by 2050.”

More measured voices among SAF’s champions also have concerns. Willie Walsh, director general of the worldwide airline trade body Iata, had pushed for fuel tanks to contain 5% SAF by 2030. He admitted last week to disappointment in progress, adding he did “not believe that target can be achieved given where we are in terms of SAF production”.

At least, he said, the case for SAF had been proved: “We now need to turn what we know is technically possible into something that’s commercially possible and commercially viable for the industry.”

The UK is trying to create the framework with a revenue certainty mechanism. A bill currently going through parliament will guarantee a price for SAF, to encourage investment in production. The Department for Transport in July allocated £63m to 17 companies looking to make SAF in Britain. A spokesperson said there were “encouraging early signs towards meeting the mandate”. But only Phillips 66 in Humberside is making SAF at scale, with the five plants promised under Boris Johnson’s “jet zero” strategy yet to appear.

Carrots and sticks are needed, with big oil companies having ever less incentive to go green when invited to drill for easy profit. Shell’s decision to stop construction of a Rotterdam biofuel plant, expected to be one of Europe’s biggest converters of waste to jet fuel, will make SAF rarer and dearer. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill” slashes US incentives for SAF production introduced by Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act – although, in a concession to American crop farmers, some subsidies on homegrown SAF feedstocks will continue for two more years.

Philip New, a former BP alternative energy executive and government adviser on SAF, says: “I’m very pessimistic about SAF in the US. There’s no mandate or regulations or reason to use it.”

Beyond the US, geopolitics could weigh on supplies in various ways, he says. Tariffs could divert more Chinese cooking oil for SAF in Europe; meanwhile, Asian countries introducing their own mandates and quotas may not want to export.

New still believes SAF will come but warns: “It is going to be a lumpy transition.”

Current UK and EU mandates can be met entirely with HEFA (hydrotreated esters and fatty acid) based SAF, made from sources such as recycled cooking oil – though its provenance has been questioned. The bigger hurdles come as governments demand second generation (2G) SAF, made of feedstocks such as household rubbish.

Alderslade says production of 2G is “the great unknown”. Missing the mandate, he says, will bring financial penalties “which inevitably will be passed through to passengers”.

New says: “In theory this is a really great way of getting rid of our waste.” The challenge is getting the right level of support to back up the very high-risk first generations of these technologies.” Even with government backing, the 2G targets for 2030 are unlikely to be met, he adds.

Despite the risks, investors see the long-term value. One global asset manager, who declined to be named, said the US was an outlier in abandoning net zero, with mandates coming to Asia as well as Europe. “For oil majors, SAF is lower priority, it’s hard – some people are giving up. But airlines can’t abandon it. It’s going to be bumpy – but is it all coming down? No.”

Differing views among airlines, he suggests, may reflect the ease of access and price paid for SAF at the airports they use: “There’s no shortage in the hubs.”

The British Airways owner, IAG, says it has a “long-term commitment”, with some justification – it announced plans in 2011 for a pioneering waste-to-fuel plant in Essex, although it admitted defeat by 2017. IAG says there will be enough SAF to meet EU and UK mandates until 2030. But a spokesperson added: “Second and third generation SAFs do require more investment and development [and] support … Mandates are one lever to stimulate demand but investment in production is key.”

Green shoots are still appearing: a Belfast company, Catagen, last month launched patented modular technology which it said could produce SAF at quantities needed in the vicinity of smaller airports, a development endorsed by Ryanair.

For BA’s home airport, the debate has particular urgency: if the sustainable aviation roadmap crumbles, Heathrow’s third runway becomes ever more politically difficult.

Matt Gorman, director of carbon strategy at Heathrow, insists: “SAF is not hypothetical. Heathrow is already leading globally in SAF use, 17% of the world’s SAF in 2024 was used here. This is real progress, not a future promise.”

Some environmental campaigners, while remaining firmly against Heathrow expansion, have shifted on SAF, accepting it as a potential route to future decarbonisation – even if many fear it acts as a fig leaf to deflect environmental concerns today.

Planes will continue to emit CO2 as usual at the tailpipe – and in the broader context, will still be depleting resources. Matt Finch, in a report for the Aviation Environment Federation, said: “The blunt truth is that there is not a single SAF feedstock that can’t be used in another sector where it would bring a desirable environmental outcome. And in some cases, that outcome is already what a large proportion of the waste is used for. “

That caveat applies even for the gold standard fuel, third generation, or e-SAF, created via CO2 capture and renewable electricity. It has been synthesised in small quantities, and tested in a Swiss “solar fuel” flight this July. But e-SAF requires green hydrogen, supplies of which, Walsh says, are “very limited, and also extremely expensive”. Investors in e-SAF right now, according to the City insider, “will probably lose their money”.

Where the technology goes is unclear, history suggests. De Pinedo was to die eight years after his seaplane feats, in a conventional plane taking off from a runway in New York in 1933. Flying boats were superseded by the advent of jet aircraft during the second world war.

“Predicting the future will always involve some uncertainty,” Gorman says. “But what we’re doing is not guesswork. It’s based on evidence, expert consensus, and a clear roadmap.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea63461783d4286a0a31a916d56250068a4e3921/779_0_3960_3168/master/3960.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0293a3133755ce87f183190855417dc5",N,,2025-10-03 11:57:39.622226

The round was led by Dawn Capital, with backing from high-profile investors, including Frank Slootman (former CEO of Snowflake and ServiceNow), Arash Ferdowsi (co-founder of Dropbox), Y Combinator, and several experienced CISOs.

The new capital injection will accelerate its expansion by hiring more security engineers, advancing its technology capabilities, and scaling proven go-to-market strategies. A particular focus will be placed on enhancing the platform with intelligent automation across different areas of cybersecurity.

With this funding, Oneleet is also doubling down on its belief that compliance alone is not sufficient.

Closing the gap between paper compliance and real security

For many companies, earning SOC 2 or ISO 27001 certifications has become a checkbox exercise to secure contracts. Too often, this results in staged penetration tests, staged exercises, and screenshots that satisfy auditors but fail to build genuine protection. The outcome is a certificate on paper, but systems remain vulnerable.

Oneleet was founded by Bryan Onel and his wife Ora Onel and college friend Erik Vogelzang in 2022. With backgrounds in penetration testing against corporations and government agencies, saw a pattern wherein organisations with valid certifications were still breached quickly. This revealed a broken system where compliance outweighed real security.

Oneleet’s solution is to merge the two into one approach, ensuring that robust defences naturally meet compliance requirements rather than the other way around.

A unified platform

The company’s platform eliminates the need for multiple vendors by bringing together essential services into a single system. It integrates penetration testing, code scanning, cloud posture management, attack surface monitoring, mobile device management, and employee security training under one roof.

Instead of organisations piecing together fragmented tools, Oneleet delivers end-to-end coverage in one place. This integrated design speeds up compliance processes, helps companies exceed audit standards, and reduces risks that come from relying on third-party systems. By owning and managing its full security stack, the company provides consistent results and takes complete responsibility for keeping systems protected.

The platform also guarantees compliance outcomes by embedding rigorous security practices into day-to-day operations. Compliance becomes the outcome of good security rather than a separate process built around checklists.

Bryan Onel, CEO of Oneleet, said, “From our first call with Dawn, we knew we’d found the right partner. They understood the space deeply and immediately grasped what we’re building: compliance as the wedge, security as the substance. Their conviction, professionalism, and enthusiasm were evident from day one—Henry Mason was on a plane from London to San Francisco within 24 hours to meet in person.”

He added: “We use AI extensively—but responsibly. AI works in the background for threat modeling and risk assessments, but clients never see hallucinations because we verify everything first with human expertise, where technology falls short. The proof is in outcomes: We regularly win customers from major competitors after those companies lost deals due to inadequate security. We implement real security, and they close the deals they previously couldn’t.”",https://techfundingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Oneleet-founders.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 11:57:43.908541

Ltd., a global leader in digital modular blending solutions for SAF, on Oct. 1 announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU).

Under the MOU, XCF and FlyORO will explore the creation of a global partnership to help solve one of aviation's biggest bottlenecks: SAF supply chain and blending inefficiencies. As most blending occurs upstream at production facilities, there are limitations to flexibility and scalability. Midstream and downstream infrastructure such as terminals or airports often lack the equipment and certification processes needed for blending. Together, XCF and FlyORO intend to co-develop an end-to-end solution to enable the ready uplift of SAF. By combining XCF's expertise in SAF production infrastructure with FlyORO's patented modular blending technology - AlphaLite - designed for flexible deployment either on-airport or pre-airport, the collaboration aims to support cost-effective, compliant, and scalable SAF integration into the global aviation fuel system.

The urgency to deploy scalable SAF infrastructure has never been greater. By 2030, the global SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion, with worldwide demand expected to surpass 5.5 billion gallons. As this demand accelerates, next-generation blending solutions such as FlyORO's AlphaLite system, an innovative, flexible, and low-CAPEX technology, will be critical to bridging production with airports and fleets worldwide.

This potential partnership aligns directly with XCF's international expansion strategy announced in June 2025, under which the company is pursuing a capital-efficient, modular approach to global SAF deployment through regionally tailored partnerships. The potential collaboration with FlyORO would be expected to strengthen XCF's ability to deliver end-to-end SAF solutions, from production through blending and distribution, across the world.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global, commented, ""This partnership has the potential to rewire how the aviation industry thinks about SAF deployment. Blending isn't just a technical step, it's a critical piece of the infrastructure puzzle that determines how fast SAF can scale. By combining FlyORO's cutting-edge blending technology with XCF's global strategy, we're creating a pathway to accelerate adoption, reduce costs, and unlock new growth opportunities for investors and stakeholders alike.""

Damian Mc Loughlin, chief commercial officer of FlyORO, commented, ""FlyORO was founded with the mission to eliminate barriers to SAF adoption. Our modular AlphaLite system makes blending more flexible, scalable, and affordable. Working with XCF, we can expand this vision globally, bringing smarter logistics and faster SAF deployment to airports and airlines around the world.""

BY Advanced Biofuels Canada

Advanced Biofuels Canada (ABFC) on Sept. 22 released the 10th annual Navius Research Biofuels in Canada report, the national report on Canada’s renewable and low-carbon fuel markets. Recognized as one of the most effective ways to reduce transportation greenhouse gas emissions, biofuels have reached record use in Canada.

The report provides a clear, data-driven picture of consumption, emissions reductions, policy impacts, and market trends at the federal and provincial levels. “Biofuels turn Canadian crops into economic growth, supporting farm families and rural economies, strengthening national energy security by diversifying Canada’s fuel supply, all while reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” said Fred Ghatala, President of Advanced Biofuels Canada.

“The federal Clean Fuel Regulations, along with complementary provincial policies in all provinces (except Atlantic Canada), have been central to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from gasoline and diesel use. This year’s results show policy leadership is translating into real-world impacts on economic growth, consumer choice, and affordability,” said Ghatala.

The report finds that renewable fuel content reached a record high in 2024, with ethanol nearing the key 10% blend level and biofuels in diesel tripling the federal target, reaching nearly 7% in renewable content.

Other important 2025 findings include:

In 2024, biomass-based diesel (BBD)’s consumption rose 9% to almost 1.5 billion liters per year, while ethanol increased 6% to 4.2 billion liters per year.

The average carbon intensity (CI) of biomass-based diesel fuels is 86% less than fossil diesel, and the CI of ethanol is 57% less than gasoline.

Since 2010, the use of biofuels in Canada has reduced wholesale fuel costs by $1.25 billion.

In 2024, Canada achieved a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction of 13.3 million metric tons of CO₂, more than double the impact recorded in 2020.

In British Columbia, biomass-based diesel content was over 31% by volume in 2024 – the highest in Canada.

In 2024, ethanol blending resulted in savings of 7.4 cents per liter in gasoline and biodiesel and renewable diesel added costs of 2.5 cents per liter in diesel.

Biofuel blended in gasoline (e.g. ethanol) reduced wholesale costs by $1.7 billion in 2024. Since 2010, ethanol has reduced wholesale gasoline costs by over $13.2 billion.

Biofuels blended with diesel fuel (renewable diesel and biodiesel) increased diesel wholesale costs by around $870 million in 2024. Since 2010, biofuel in diesel has increased wholesale diesel costs by $8.2 billion. When taken together, renewable fuel blending in gasoline and diesel fuels has resulted in wholesale cost savings for Canadians.

Emission abatement benefits for ethanol improved sharply, with a ‘negative’ net cost of $151 per metric ton (compared to $116 per metric ton in 2023), while costs for diesel-based biofuels remained unchanged ($257).

Electricity consumption by light-duty vehicles rose 58% in 2024, following 41% growth in 2023, while EVs and PHEVs made up one in six of new light-duty vehicles.

New in the 2025 report methodology: trade-flow data (CIMT) profiles domestic and import fuel use. Fuel volumes and CFR market data are used to estimate net annual credit supply, track the credit bank or deficit, and forecast the balance through 2025.

“Canadian producers faced a particularly challenging year due to U.S. government subsidies, which continue to influence the flow of renewable fuels across the border. Imports from the U.S. are the largest component of Canada’s renewable fuel trade, with imported volumes six to seven times greater than exports. More than 95% of Canada’s renewable fuel imports and 80% of exports are with the U.S., underscoring the importance of a stable and supportive domestic policy environment.

“Strong policy is essential to keep Canadian production viable, particularly since most jobs related to biofuel are found in remote and rural regions. Both federal and provincial governments have made important commitments in 2025, including the launch of the federal Biofuels Incentive Program, which provides a per-litre subsidy for Canadian producers for up to 300 million litres per year. Provinces also took steps to support the sector: British Columbia increased its renewable fuel blend rate for diesel, and both B.C. and Ontario introduced “made-in-Canada” requirements for minimum blend rates. These measures strengthen demand for domestic production and help ensure that Canadian facilities remain competitive.

“Canada’s fuel policies are working as designed. The federal Clean Fuel Regulations drove an 11% increase in low-carbon fuel use in 2024. In British Columbia, where the government recognizes the Low Carbon Fuel Standard as the most effective method of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the province, biofuel use rose by 27%. Importantly, BC’s fuel regulations helped drive major capital investments in new biomass-based diesel production capacity that came online in 2024 and 2025 in Vancouver, Prince George, and Edmonton,” Ghatala added. “The report shows Canada has the opportunity to be a global leader in sustainable fuels. Growth in the sector will add resilience to our economy through diversification of supply chains and new trading relationships. We will be working directly with our federal and provincial governments to protect and grow Canada’s biofuels sector.”

IATA has urged governments to provide direct incentives to producers, harmonise global standards and reaffirm the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) as the only international framework for carbon offsetting.

The global market for SAF is small - about US$2.9bn in 2025 compared to the US$239bn global market for conventional aviation fuel, Reuters wrote on 16 September, citing analysis firm SkyQuest Technology Group.

However, additional SAF demand could result in the expansion of cattle herds and directly or indirectly drive deforestation and forest degradation, the news agency wrote, finding in an investigation that US firm Diamond Green Diesel (DGD) had been purchasing tallow from cattle raised on illegally cleared lands in the Amazon rainforest to produce renewable diesel and SAF.

The seminar, hosted on September 22 and 23 by the BAF as part of the Australian Defence Force’s Indo-Pacific Endeavour 2025 activities, covered the challenges of climate change and opportunities for militaries to invest in sustainable aviation fuel.

Air Vice Marshal Tariqul’s opening remarks were amplified by presentations during the seminar that revealed how Bangladesh, which contributes just 0.04 per cent of historical global carbon emissions, will disproportionately bear the impacts of rising temperatures as rising seawater could force millions from their coastal homes and into already crowded cities or neighbouring countries.

This would be not only be an humanitarian issue, but also a security and conflict challenge, placing militaries in the middle, tasked with maintaining stability and order.

Squadron Leader Israt Arza Fahima told the seminar how air forces were reckoning with the threats posed by climate change, saying air operations must evolve “not just to defend borders, but to protect our planet and our people”.

Apart from taking part in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, militaries – whose own carbon footprint an independent study from the Conflict and Environment Observatory estimates could account for about 5.5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions – were flagged as having a role to play in reducing their impact through measures such as transitioning to more sustainable fuels.

Royal Australian Navy officer Commander Steven Cole, of the Defence Energy Transition Office, led a discussion on sustainable aviation fuels, which can be sourced from crops and other organic materials. This presented opportunities for both Bangladesh and Australia to enhance self-sufficiency.

'I think we can learn a great deal from how they have achieved that level of action and care.'

This was important, given the vulnerabilities of relying on foreign fuel sources, particularly during conflict when supply routes can be disrupted.

He said the shift to sustainable fuels offered the chance to produce energy locally, delivering energy security and independence in times of conflict as a key benefit.

Another area of collaboration raised at the seminar was the certification of platforms for sustainable fuel use, a process that has taken Australia about 15 years, with all Army rotary-wing and Air Force fixed-wing aircraft now certified.

Commander Cole said Australia’s experience meant it could share knowledge to make the certification process easier for others.

Short-term solutions, e-fuels and e-SAF

Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. Batteries may work for short-haul flights, but energy density requirements make them impractical for long-haul.

Hydrogen offers a near-term solution in the form of e-fuels or e-SAF, produced by combining clean hydrogen with captured CO₂.

These synthetic fuels create a drop-in kerosene replacement compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure, making them the fastest route for hydrogen to enter aviation.

While both e-fuels and hydrogen are costly today, e-fuels allow airlines to begin reducing emissions immediately while leveraging existing supply chains and aircraft designs.

Long-term pathway, hydrogen-powered aircraft

The second, longer-term pathway is hydrogen-powered aircraft, including fuel cells for smaller planes or liquid hydrogen combustion turbines for medium-haul flights.

Using hydrogen directly in fuel cells or combustion avoids the 30–40% energy loss inherent in e-fuel production, delivering more flight miles per unit of renewable electricity.

Unlike bio-based SAF, which is feedstock-limited, or e-fuels, which recycle CO₂, hydrogen from renewables emits only water vapor. Falling electrolyser prices, abundant renewable power in regions such as the Middle East, and scale could make hydrogen cheaper than e-fuels by the 2030s.

Aircraft technology is advancing in parallel, with regional fuel-cell planes expected within the decade and medium-haul hydrogen turbines on the horizon. Hydrogen also increases energy security, reducing reliance on imported fuels and hedging against stricter carbon pricing.

In short, while SAF helps near-term and e-fuels provide compatibility, hydrogen is the scalable, clean, strategic fuel for the next generation of aviation. Aviation already accounts for 2–3% of global CO₂ emissions, a share that could grow as other sectors decarbonize.

IATA has pledged net-zero by 2050, and regulators in Europe, the US, and Asia are tightening emissions rules. Without hydrogen, these targets look increasingly out of reach.

Why aviation is lagging

AirBus CEO tells us, “we’re absolutely convinced that hydrogen is an energy for the future of aviation,”, yet, despite its potential, aviation hydrogen is far behind.

The Global Hydrogen Compass 2025 shows 70% of binding hydrogen offtake today is in refining and ammonia, aviation hardly registers.

Four major barriers persist:

Economics. Hydrogen-derived jet fuels remain three to five times costlier than fossil kerosene. Airlines operate on thin margins and cannot easily absorb costs.

Policy uncertainty. Mandates like the EU’s RED for RFNBOs create demand pull, but enforcement is uneven, making airlines hesitant to sign long-term contracts.

Infrastructure gaps. Hydrogen fueling systems, pipelines, and certification processes are nascent, unlike ammonia or refining which leverage existing supply chains.

Competing priorities. Airlines focus on bio-based SAF, cheaper and certified up to 50% blends, while hydrogen risks being sidelined until SAF scaling limits are reached.

As the report notes, many aviation hydrogen projects have “less momentum,” and only those with creative business models or policy support are currently able to advance.

Industry responses & case studies

Signs of progress exist. Project Roadrunner, a US commercial-scale e-fuels project, produces eSAF, eDiesel, and eNaphtha from renewable hydrogen and CO₂, securing long-term offtake from American Airlines and IAG.

Other projects, Stegra renewable steel in Sweden, NGHC green hydrogen in Saudi Arabia, and Yara green ammonia terminal in Germany, show how scale, regulatory clarity, and partnerships move projects from concept to reality.

Hydrogen CEOs consistently identify certainty of offtake as key. For aviation, this means long-term contracts, government-backed mechanisms like contracts-for-difference, and clearer regulatory roadmaps.

Opportunity in the Middle East

If aviation hydrogen struggles globally, the Middle East could accelerate it.

The region has committed 0.5 mtpa of clean hydrogen, split between renewable and low-carbon, with mega-projects like NGHC.

Ultra-low-cost solar and wind, established export infrastructure, and access to financing position the region to produce hydrogen-derived fuels for export.

The Gulf airlines, Emirates, Qatar Airways, Etihad, Saudia, face European mandates requiring increasing SAF and e-fuels, creating a captive demand base.

Producing hydrogen fuels locally and exporting globally could make the Middle East the refueling hub for the hydrogen aviation era.

Hydrogen is a strategic choice. Airlines, policymakers, and investors who commit now will shape the next era of flight, while those who wait risk being left behind.

At first glance, used cooking oil is about as uninspiring a material as one can imagine. It is greasy, sticky, and malodorous. It comes in dented tins left out in the heat behind roadside stalls, in sloshing plastic drums beside hotel kitchens, or in small bottles kept under household sinks. For decades, it was treated as a nuisance, something to be discarded rather than valued. Some poured it down drains, causing blockages and pollution. Others sold it to informal operators who found low-value and unhealthy uses for it in animal feed or soap making. Almost no one, however, ever thought of it as a strategic commodity. And certainly not as something that could help decarbonize one of the hardest-to-abate industries in the world: aviation.

The story of how used cooking oil made its way from trash bins to jet engines is one of persistence, vision, and stubborn belief. It is also the story of how Malaysia, through the work of FatHopes Energy, stood at the center of building the world’s first truly scalable used cooking oil supply chain. To understand how this unlikely waste stream became the bedrock of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, one must go back to the late 2000s, a time when the very idea was treated as laughable.

In 2007, when I first began speaking about the potential of used cooking oil as a biofuel feedstock, the reaction was almost universally dismissive. Policymakers smiled politely but quickly moved on to more serious topics like palm oil or rapeseed. Energy executives shook their heads and asked why anyone would bother with such a messy, inconsistent waste stream when clean, uniform crop oils were plentiful. Even within the emerging biofuels community, which prided itself on innovation, used cooking oil was considered marginal at best. The refrain was familiar: it was too dirty, too variable in quality, impossible to collect at scale, and unlikely ever to pass certification. Those who were generous called it an interesting curiosity. Those less charitable called it a distraction.

But I saw something different. I grew up surrounded by kitchens, hawker stalls, restaurants, and food factories that produced oil waste every single day. I saw that this material, ignored by everyone else, was everywhere and in enormous quantities. What others considered a liability, I saw as an untapped resource. Every bowl of fried noodles, every piece of fried chicken, every snack prepared on the streets generated a residue that could be captured, cleaned, and transformed into energy. If only a system existed to do so at scale, then this so-called waste could become a feedstock as significant as any crop oil.

The problem was not availability, but aggregation. There was no infrastructure to collect used cooking oil consistently. The market was dominated by informal traders operating in cash, with no concern for traceability, sustainability, or quality. Certification bodies were skeptical. Policymakers ignored it. Yet the kitchens kept producing it, day in and day out. I became convinced that the barrier was not the feedstock itself, but the absence of a structured supply chain. And so began the journey of building that system from the ground up.

The early years were brutal. Convincing vendors to give up their oil was difficult. Many saw no reason to part with it. Some disposed of it cheaply, others feared the hassle of collection, and almost none trusted that there would be a consistent buyer. On the other side, trying to persuade refiners or policymakers to take the material seriously was an even greater uphill battle. They asked why anyone would want to fuel vehicles, let alone aircraft, with fryer grease. The more polite audiences smiled at the idea; the harsher ones laughed openly. I was told repeatedly that aviation would never run on waste oils, that no regulator would approve it, and that even if it were technically possible, the economics would never make sense.

But every day I looked around me and saw proof that the skeptics were wrong. Waste oil was everywhere. The only thing missing was a system to channel it. And so I began to lay the foundations for what would later become FatHopes Energy’s defining achievement: the first large-scale, transparent, and traceable used cooking oil supply chain in Southeast Asia.

We started small, visiting eateries one by one, explaining the concept, offering to pay for the oil that would otherwise be discarded. It was slow and painstaking. Many were unconvinced. Some thought we were crazy. But a few agreed, and with each new vendor, the supply chain began to take shape. We invested in small collection trucks, later mini-tankers, designed to navigate narrow streets and pick up oil in small but regular volumes. We established depots where oil could be aggregated, filtered, tested, and stored safely before being exported. Week by week, month by month, the system grew. What began as an idea ridiculed by many began to take the shape of a functioning supply chain.

At the same time, I knew that building physical infrastructure was not enough. Perception had to change. Certification bodies had to be convinced. Policymakers had to be engaged. And so we began to travel relentlessly, taking the case for used cooking oil to every forum that would listen. From small workshops to major global conferences, I presented again and again on why wastes and residues, particularly UCO, represented the true sustainable pathway for biofuels. I argued that unlike crop oils, they did not displace food. Unlike fossil fuels, they did not add new carbon to the atmosphere. And unlike unregulated informal markets, a structured and certified system could provide trust and transparency. At first, the response was skeptical. But repetition matters. Presence matters. And gradually, the narrative began to shift.

By 2011, the first cracks in the wall of resistance began to appear. ASTM International, which sets the standards for aviation fuels, approved hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids — HEFA-SPK — as a blending component for jet fuel. This was the breakthrough. For the first time, lipid-based pathways, including those derived from used cooking oil, were officially recognized as viable for aviation. Around the same time, airlines began conducting their first demonstration flights on bio-jet blends. Some of these included UCO-derived fuels. What had seemed laughable only a few years before was now becoming a technical reality. The skepticism did not disappear overnight, but the door was open.

Even so, scaling remained daunting. Most of the global industry continued to rely on virgin vegetable oils as feedstocks. UCO volumes were small, fragmented, and uncertain. Certification remained complicated. Policymakers were slow to adapt. But the momentum had begun. And for FatHopes Energy, the mission was clear: prove that UCO could be aggregated at scale, prove that it could be certified, and prove that it could become a dependable cornerstone of biofuels.

In those years, conferences became our second home. From Amsterdam to London, from Singapore to Washington, I found myself on stages where the message was simple but urgent: wastes and residues must come first. The industry could not continue to lean on virgin oils if it wanted to claim sustainability with integrity. Again and again, I told rooms filled with skeptical faces that the fryer oil in their kitchens was the future of jet fuel. Slowly, the laughter faded. Slowly, the questions became less dismissive and more curious. How much volume could actually be collected? What would the cost structure look like? Could it really be scaled beyond niche markets?

To answer these questions, we had to show proof. We began publishing weekly buying prices, creating transparency in a market that had previously thrived on opacity. We expanded our fleet, optimized collection routes, and invested in depots that could handle growing volumes. Vendors who once distrusted us began to see that this was not a fly-by-night scheme but a genuine business model. They began to call us rather than wait for us to show up. Trust was forming, one vendor at a time, one liter at a time.

For refiners and policymakers, the credibility came from certification. We worked closely with ISCC to ensure that every drop could be traced, verified, and audited. We brought auditors to the depots, showed them the trucks, introduced them to the vendors. We proved that this was not theoretical but real. And gradually, UCO began to appear on official lists of recognized feedstocks. The once unthinkable was becoming accepted.

By 2013 and 2014, volumes were rising. European biodiesel plants were beginning to integrate UCO more consistently. The term “waste-based biodiesel” began appearing in regulatory documents. Airlines began exploring longer-term contracts for waste-based SAF. It was still early days, but the tide was turning. What had once been dismissed was now being considered. And in every forum, FatHopes Energy was there — not just as a participant but as the face of UCO.

As the supply chain matured, the importance of credibility only grew. Buyers in Europe and later in North America wanted assurances that the oil they were purchasing was truly waste and not disguised virgin palm or soy. The risk of fraud loomed large, and regulators were tightening their oversight. We recognized early on that if used cooking oil was to become a cornerstone feedstock, it could not rest on verbal promises or paper trails. It required traceability. This realization led us down a path that would become one of FatHopes Energy’s defining contributions to the industry: the development of a digital traceability system years before the world demanded it.

By 2016, we were investing heavily in digital infrastructure that would give us real-time visibility across the collection network. It was a bold move. Technology at the time was still catching up, and most operators were content with spreadsheets, receipts, and manual checks. But I was convinced that data integrity would become the single most important differentiator in the feedstock business. If you could prove origin, if you could show chain-of-custody, if you could quantify carbon savings, then you could build trust not only with refiners but also with regulators and airlines. Without it, growth would always be capped by suspicion.

We created a suite of applications that tied together vendors, drivers, rangers, and consumers in one ecosystem. Vendors could schedule collections, track payments, and monitor their performance through a mobile app. Drivers had an app that optimized their routes, accounted for truck capacity, and logged every collection in real time. Rangers, individuals who offered their homes or shops as collection points, could open and close their “stations” at optimal times suggested by AI to maximize income. Even consumers could participate, finding their nearest ranger and dropping off household UCO. Behind it all sat a back-end dashboard powered by algorithms that predicted waste generation, optimized collection schedules, and provided carbon accounting.

This was more than technology. It was a philosophy: transparency by design. Every liter collected had a digital footprint. Every handoff was recorded. Every vendor and driver could be rated, creating a feedback loop of accountability. Certification bodies embraced it because it made their job easier. Buyers loved it because it de-risked their purchases. And vendors, many of whom were small businesses or households, trusted it because it gave them clarity and fairness.

The industry did not yet realize it, but we had leapt ahead of the curve. Only years later, when “blockchain traceability” and “AI-powered supply chains” became buzzwords, did people begin to understand that we had been operating that way for years. What others described as future aspirations was, for us, already daily practice. This foresight gave us an enormous credibility advantage, and it strengthened our position as the global face of UCO.

At conferences in Europe and Asia, I began to notice a shift. The questions were no longer about whether UCO could be collected but about how much could be scaled, what costs looked like, and how quickly it could be integrated into aviation supply chains. Airlines that once dismissed the concept were now actively pursuing offtake agreements. Regulators who once ignored it were now writing it into their renewable energy directives. The narrative had flipped, and used cooking oil was suddenly in high demand.

But demand brought new challenges. As volumes increased, so did competition. Traders who had once dismissed UCO began to enter the market, some playing fair, others less so. The risk of adulteration — mixing virgin palm with UCO — increased as prices rose. This was precisely why our investment in digital traceability mattered. While others struggled to prove authenticity, we could show data, audits, and history. This gave us resilience and kept buyers loyal.

It also meant that we had to expand rapidly. By the late 2010s, our collection network stretched across Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and into other parts of Southeast Asia. Each country had its own dynamics, but the fundamentals were the same: waste oil was abundant, but it needed structure, trust, and certification. By building this across borders, we positioned Southeast Asia as a global hub for UCO exports, supplying refiners in Europe and North America with volumes they desperately needed to meet mandates.

The irony was striking. A feedstock once dismissed as too dirty and small-scale was now being shipped across oceans to power aircraft in some of the most advanced economies in the world. The same oil that once clogged drains in Kuala Lumpur or spoiled in drums behind hawker stalls was now certified, traceable, and refined into jet fuel for airlines in Frankfurt, San Francisco, and Singapore. What had changed was not the material itself but the systems around it — systems that we had built, often against the tide of skepticism.

As the world entered the 2020s, the urgency of aviation decarbonization became undeniable. The industry’s 2050 net-zero pledge, announced in 2021, made clear that sustainable aviation fuel would account for 65 percent of the sector’s required carbon reductions. The math was brutal: hundreds of millions of tonnes of SAF would be required annually by mid-century. No single feedstock could deliver that volume, but in the near term, only HEFA — the pathway based on oils and fats — could scale fast enough to meet demand. And within HEFA, used cooking oil stood out as the most sustainable, most socially acceptable, and most credible source.

This realization drove demand through the roof. Airlines scrambled to sign long-term contracts. Governments introduced mandates. Investors poured money into refinery projects. Yet behind the headlines, the reality remained the same: without credible, large-scale collection of wastes like UCO, the system could not deliver. Once again, the work we had done years earlier positioned us at the center of the solution.

By this time, FatHopes Energy was no longer just a collector. We had become an ecosystem: a logistics company, a technology company, a certification partner, and a trusted voice on global platforms. At events like the World Economic Forum, Argus Biofuels, and countless policy summits, I spoke not as someone trying to convince the world that UCO mattered but as someone showing proof that it already did. We had lived through the skepticism, we had built the systems, and now we were scaling them.

The role of UCO in SAF was now indisputable. Volumes were measured in millions of tonnes annually. UCO-based HEFA SAF was being used on commercial flights around the world. Policymakers explicitly prioritized wastes and residues in their regulations, making UCO not only desirable but essential. In Europe, RED II mandated double-counting for UCO, effectively giving it a higher value. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act created incentives that made waste-based SAF financially attractive. In Asia, countries like Singapore positioned themselves as refining hubs precisely because of their access to regional UCO flows.

Still, challenges persisted. Collection remained fragmented in many parts of the world. Fraud risks continued to haunt the industry. And the volumes, while impressive compared to a decade earlier, were still tiny compared to the total demand for jet fuel. UCO was never going to be the sole solution. But it was the best available bridge — the feedstock that could anchor SAF supply in the 2020s while other technologies matured. Without it, aviation’s net-zero targets would already be out of reach.

Looking back, the transformation is almost surreal. In 2007, I was told repeatedly that fryer grease would never fuel a plane. In 2025, the same material is considered indispensable to aviation’s future. The shift is not only technological but cultural. It reflects a broader rethinking of value: that what was once waste can be wealth, that sustainability is not about perfection but about pragmatism, and that sometimes the dirtiest feedstock can be the cleanest solution.

At conferences around the world, our presence became more than symbolic. It was a signal that used cooking oil had a voice, and that this voice came from Southeast Asia — a region that had long been overlooked in the global energy transition narrative. I stood on stages in Amsterdam, London, New York, and Beijing, often surrounded by representatives of the oil majors, government ministries, and large agricultural lobbies. Many of them still preferred to talk about rapeseed, soy, or palm. They had long histories, entrenched infrastructure, and powerful political backers. Yet our story was different. We were not offering a theory or an ambition. We were showing reality: real volumes, real trucks, real vendors, and real data.

It was not uncommon to be the lone voice advocating UCO in those early sessions. I remember vividly the looks I received when I would say that street hawkers in Kuala Lumpur were, in their own way, fuelling the future of aviation. Some chuckled, some shook their heads, but increasingly, some leaned forward and asked, “Tell us more.” Slowly, the skepticism began to transform into curiosity, and curiosity into belief. By being present, by telling our story over and over, we became the face of UCO.

Representation mattered because the world needed proof. On the ground in Malaysia, we were proving it by collecting thousands of liters every day. On the global stage, we were proving it by shifting narratives and persuading policymakers to enshrine UCO into law. At industry roundtables, when the debate turned to the sustainability of crop oils, I would remind them that waste streams like UCO had no food-versus-fuel controversy. When critics questioned scalability, I would point to our expanding network across Malaysia, Indonesia, and beyond. When certification bodies hesitated, I would walk them through our data, our audits, and our digital records. Piece by piece, we dismantled the objections that once seemed insurmountable.

But credibility in sustainability is fragile, and the higher the stakes, the higher the scrutiny. By the mid-2010s, as UCO volumes and prices increased, so too did the risks of fraud and manipulation. Stories began to surface of virgin oils being passed off as waste, of documents being forged, of middlemen cutting corners. These incidents threatened not only the reputations of individual companies but the credibility of UCO as a feedstock category. For us, this was a defining moment. If the integrity of the supply chain was compromised, all the work of the past decade could unravel.

This is why in 2016 we made the strategic leap into digital traceability. At the time, most of the industry was content with paperwork — receipts, delivery notes, audit visits once or twice a year. But we understood that the future would demand real-time verification. It would demand proof that could not be faked. And it would demand data that could withstand scrutiny from regulators, investors, and airlines alike.

We began building what would later be recognized as one of the most advanced digital ecosystems in the waste-to-biofuels industry. It was not just software; it was a philosophy of radical transparency. The vendor app gave small eateries and factories the ability to schedule pickups, track payments, and monitor their environmental impact. The driver app provided optimized routes, real-time volume logging, and performance tracking. Rangers, the community collectors who played such a crucial role in expanding access, were empowered with tools to decide when to open their collection points and how to maximize their returns. Even households, often overlooked in waste systems, were included through consumer-facing interfaces that allowed them to find the nearest drop-off points.

On the back end, we layered artificial intelligence to make the system smarter over time. It predicted which vendors would have oil ready and when, optimizing truck utilization and reducing wasted trips. It forecasted volumes across regions, enabling us to plan depot capacity and export flows more efficiently. And it calculated carbon savings with granularity, providing every stakeholder with a tangible measure of their contribution to decarbonization.

This digital ecosystem did more than make operations efficient. It made the supply chain trustworthy. Every collection created a digital footprint, geotagged and timestamped. Every liter could be traced back to its source. Every transaction was logged, and every stakeholder could be rated. This level of accountability transformed vendor relationships. For the first time, small restaurants and households could see their role in the global sustainability movement. They were no longer just disposing of waste; they were participants in the decarbonization of aviation.

For certification bodies, the platform was a gift. Auditors no longer had to rely on static paperwork. They could see live data, cross-check records, and verify claims with confidence. For refiners and airlines, it was a guarantee that the fuel they were buying was genuinely waste-based, not tainted by fraud. For regulators, it was proof that policy incentives were being directed at the right feedstocks. And for us, it was a shield — a way to defend the integrity of UCO even as the market grew more complex and competitive.

Looking back, this move was visionary. Today, in 2025, digital traceability has become an industry-wide buzzword. Everyone talks about blockchain, AI, and real-time verification. But we were practicing it nearly a decade earlier. That head start not only protected our credibility but positioned us as the standard-bearer for integrity in the UCO supply chain. When others speak of aspirations, we speak of experience. And that difference matters.

By the early 2020s, UCO had fully arrived on the global stage. Airlines that once ignored it were now signing long-term offtake agreements with refiners reliant on UCO. Policymakers in Europe, the UK, and the US had enshrined it in mandates and incentives. Analysts projected millions of tonnes of demand annually. The EU’s RED II directive gave UCO double-counting benefits, reflecting its sustainability advantages. The US Inflation Reduction Act created tax credits that made waste-based SAF commercially attractive. Singapore, leveraging its refining infrastructure, positioned itself as an Asian hub for SAF, reliant heavily on UCO imports. Everywhere one looked, UCO had gone from curiosity to cornerstone.

The carbon math was compelling. Lifecycle analyses showed that UCO-based HEFA SAF could deliver greenhouse gas savings of up to 80 percent compared to fossil jet fuel. Few other pathways could match that performance. Unlike crop oils, UCO carried no risk of indirect land-use change, one of the most contentious issues in biofuels. Unlike more experimental pathways, it was already proven at commercial scale. It was not just a good option; it was, in many ways, the best option available in the critical decade of the 2020s.

This did not mean the challenges disappeared. Fraud risks remained, particularly in regions without robust traceability. Collection was still fragmented in many countries, with vast volumes slipping through the cracks. Logistics costs were significant, and competition for feedstock was intense. And even at scale, UCO could only ever supply a fraction of global jet demand. But it was a vital fraction. It was the bridge that aviation desperately needed while other technologies matured. Without UCO, the industry’s 2030 targets would already be out of reach.

For us at FatHopes Energy, this was both validation and responsibility. We had spent more than a decade being told it was impossible, only to prove that it was not only possible but indispensable. We had fought battles for recognition, only to see policymakers now writing our arguments into law. We had built systems from scratch, only to see others scrambling to replicate them. And yet, the journey was far from over. Because while UCO had secured its place, the scale of the challenge ahead was immense. Aviation’s decarbonization would require not just millions but hundreds of millions of tonnes of SAF. UCO alone could not deliver that. But it could provide the foundation upon which the rest would be built.

When airlines began to move from trial flights to long-term commitments, the role of UCO shifted from symbolic to strategic. In the early 2010s, demonstration flights had been powerful but limited. Airlines such as KLM, Lufthansa, and United operated routes with small blends of bio-jet to show technical feasibility. These flights made headlines, but they were not yet commercially significant. By the late 2010s and early 2020s, however, the conversation changed. SAF was no longer a novelty — it was being integrated into decarbonization strategies, and UCO was at the center of these plans.

Consider the case of KLM. As one of the early movers in sustainable aviation, the Dutch carrier committed to incorporating SAF into its regular operations. In 2011, it operated its first commercial flight using a UCO-based blend. At the time, it was a milestone celebrated worldwide, but skeptics dismissed it as a stunt. Yet a decade later, KLM was investing in long-term SAF offtake agreements, much of which relied on HEFA fuels made from UCO. What had been symbolic had become structural.

In the United States, United Airlines took a similar path. It became the first airline to operate a commercial flight using a 100 percent SAF engine on one side, with fossil jet on the other for comparison. The SAF used was HEFA-based, produced in part from UCO. United then went on to sign multibillion-dollar offtake agreements with producers like World Energy and Neste. Each of these contracts hinged on the availability of reliable waste-based feedstocks — with UCO chief among them.

Singapore Airlines, positioned in a region where UCO availability was rich, became another case study. With its government committing to SAF as part of the nation’s green aviation strategy, Singapore Airlines secured SAF supplies from Neste’s Singapore refinery, one of the largest SAF production sites in the world. That refinery, which began operations in 2010 and later expanded specifically for SAF, relies heavily on imported UCO and residues from across Asia — including Malaysia. Here, geography mattered: Malaysia’s proximity and its established UCO collection systems made it a natural partner.

On the refining side, Neste’s story illustrates UCO’s centrality. Starting as a company focused on renewable diesel, Neste expanded into aviation by leveraging its expertise in HEFA pathways. By the 2020s, it had become the world’s largest producer of SAF, with UCO as a cornerstone feedstock. Its Singapore facility was strategically chosen not only for port access but for proximity to Southeast Asia’s vast waste oil flows. In California, World Energy’s Paramount facility followed a similar trajectory, converting refineries once used for fossil fuels into hubs for UCO-based SAF. These facilities demonstrated that scaling SAF was not a dream but a reality — provided feedstock supply chains were credible and reliable.

All of this underscored the irony of UCO’s journey. A material once dismissed as unsuitable, unscalable, and even laughable was now underwriting contracts worth billions of dollars, influencing government policy, and fueling the planes of some of the world’s largest carriers. For those of us who had fought the early battles, it was vindication — but also a reminder of the responsibility we carried.

Scaling UCO for SAF was never going to be without its challenges. Even at peak efficiency, the global pool of used cooking oil is limited by human behavior. The amount of UCO available is a function of how much food is fried, processed, and cooked in oil. Analysts estimate that globally, UCO availability could reach perhaps 30 million tonnes per year. That is a significant number, but it is small compared to total aviation demand, which exceeds 300 million tonnes of jet fuel annually. This means that while UCO can anchor SAF supply in the 2020s, it cannot be the sole solution for 2050. Other pathways — alcohol-to-jet, Fischer–Tropsch, and eventually power-to-liquids — must mature and scale.

Yet this limitation does not diminish UCO’s importance. Quite the opposite. Because the 2020s are the critical decade for SAF adoption, UCO is the feedstock that buys the world time. It provides the credibility, the carbon savings, and the volumes necessary to bridge aviation into the future. Without UCO, the 2030 blending mandates in Europe and the United States would be unattainable. Without UCO, airline decarbonization strategies would be hollow. Without UCO, SAF would remain a promise rather than a practice.

For Malaysia, this presented a profound opportunity. Unlike many countries, Malaysia was blessed with abundant access to UCO and other residues. Its dense urban centers — Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Johor Bahru — generated massive quantities of waste oil daily. Its food and beverage industry, one of the largest in Southeast Asia, contributed consistently to the supply. Its geographic location on the Straits of Malacca made it an ideal hub for aggregation and export. And critically, its industrial workforce, trained in the oleochemical and palm industries, already possessed the skills needed to handle lipid feedstocks at scale.

This combination of resources, infrastructure, and talent meant that Malaysia could be more than just a supplier of raw UCO. It could become a refining hub — turning waste oil into finished SAF for domestic airlines and for export across the region and beyond. The development of a SAF refinery in Port Klang exemplified this vision. Situated at one of the busiest transshipment hubs in the world, such a facility could leverage not only Malaysia’s domestic feedstock but also UCO flows from neighboring countries. It could serve as the anchor for a regional SAF ecosystem, positioning Malaysia as the leader of Southeast Asia’s contribution to aviation decarbonization.

Of course, leadership required more than infrastructure. It required credibility. This was where FatHopes Energy’s early investments in traceability paid dividends. By proving that UCO could be collected, certified, and digitally tracked at scale, we gave Malaysia an edge over competitors. When global refiners or airlines considered sourcing feedstock, they looked not only at volume but at integrity. They wanted assurance that the oil was real, that it was sustainable, and that it would withstand regulatory audits. By offering that assurance, Malaysia could distinguish itself in a crowded and competitive market.

The case for Malaysia’s leadership became even stronger with its upcoming chairmanship of ASEAN in 2025. As the region’s chair, Malaysia would have the platform to drive policy harmonization on SAF, encouraging neighboring countries to align on certification, traceability, and trade rules. This could unlock regional feedstock flows, reduce duplication, and build confidence among international buyers. Rather than competing in silos, ASEAN nations could present a unified front, with Malaysia at the helm. The potential impact was enormous. A coordinated ASEAN SAF strategy, anchored in Malaysia’s Port Klang refinery, could transform the region into a global hub, rivaling Europe and the United States.

For all of this to succeed, however, action was required. Policies needed to incentivize collection and refining. Investments needed to be mobilized for infrastructure. Airlines needed to sign binding offtake agreements that gave financiers confidence. And the public needed to be engaged, understanding that even the oil left over from household cooking could play a role in fueling planes sustainably. FatHopes Energy had already built much of the foundation — the collection networks, the traceability systems, the credibility. But scaling to the level aviation demanded required collective effort.

When I reflect on the journey from 2007 to 2025, I am struck by how much has changed and yet how much remains the same. The skepticism has faded, replaced by enthusiasm. The infrastructure has matured, with global refineries now running on UCO. The policy environment has shifted, with mandates and incentives in place. And yet, the work is still about convincing, building, and scaling. We no longer need to prove that UCO works. We now need to prove that it can meet the world’s urgent demand.

The future of used cooking oil in the SAF supply chain will not be without tension. On one hand, UCO has achieved what few could have imagined even a decade ago: it has become the cornerstone of aviation’s decarbonization strategy in the 2020s. On the other hand, its inherent limitations remind us that it cannot carry the weight of the industry alone. The global availability of UCO, even under the most optimistic scenarios, is capped. By 2030, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects SAF production to rise to around 30 million tonnes annually. UCO, at best, could account for one-third of that. By 2050, when aviation requires hundreds of millions of tonnes, UCO’s contribution will be proportionally smaller.

But the measure of UCO’s importance is not its ultimate volume share. It is the role it plays as a foundation. Without UCO, the SAF industry would lack the bridge feedstock it needs in this critical decade. Other pathways — alcohol-to-jet, Fischer–Tropsch from municipal waste, and eventually power-to-liquids from renewable hydrogen and captured carbon — will take years, even decades, to mature at scale. UCO is here now. It is available, it is certified, it is proven. That makes it indispensable.

The 2030s will likely be the decade when alternative pathways begin to come online in earnest. Already, pilot projects for e-fuels are producing small volumes, and FT plants using agricultural residues are being tested. But scaling them to tens of millions of tonnes will take enormous investment and political will. In the meantime, UCO will remain the backbone of SAF supply. Its role may evolve — perhaps supplying 20–25 percent of global SAF in 2030, and 10–15 percent by 2040 — but it will always be the feedstock that made the transition possible.

This reality is both comforting and challenging. Comforting, because it validates the work of those who spent decades building the UCO supply chain. Challenging, because it underscores the responsibility we bear to maximize its impact today. Every liter collected matters. Every vendor onboarded matters. Every household that participates matters. The success of aviation’s decarbonization in the 2020s hinges on whether UCO systems are robust, credible, and scalable. That is why FatHopes Energy continues to push relentlessly for expansion, innovation, and collaboration.

Malaysia’s role in this future is clear. With its combination of feedstock availability, geographic advantage, and industrial expertise, it is positioned to be more than just a participant. It can be the leader. The development of a SAF refinery in Port Klang is not just a business venture; it is a national project, one that symbolizes Malaysia’s ambition to stand at the forefront of the energy transition. Positioned at one of the busiest maritime crossroads in the world, the refinery will have access not only to domestic UCO but to flows from across Southeast Asia. With digital traceability ensuring integrity, and with global airlines hungry for supply, Port Klang can become the beating heart of SAF in Asia.

ASEAN leadership further amplifies this opportunity. In 2025, as chair of ASEAN, Malaysia has the chance to drive regional harmonization of SAF policies. Imagine a Southeast Asia where feedstock definitions are aligned, certification systems are interoperable, and trade barriers are minimized. Imagine a bloc that presents itself to the world not as fragmented markets but as a unified hub for waste-based SAF. The impact would be transformative. It would give global airlines confidence. It would attract investment. And it would ensure that Southeast Asia’s vast potential for waste-based feedstocks is fully realized.

For Malaysia, the strategic calculus is also compelling. While the nation has invested heavily in data centers, palm oil, and other industries, SAF provides a hedge — a sector with global demand, geopolitical relevance, and long-term growth. Unlike physical infrastructure projects that may lose competitiveness, SAF is tied directly to the world’s decarbonization agenda. Aviation will not stop flying; it will only seek cleaner fuels. By embedding itself in that future, Malaysia ensures resilience, relevance, and prosperity.

None of this is theoretical. The work has already begun. FatHopes Energy’s traceability systems are operational. Vendors across the region are already participating. Depots are in place, mini-tankers are running, exports are flowing. Certification bodies recognize the integrity of the system. Airlines are signing contracts. Refiners are expanding capacity. The foundation is solid. What is required now is acceleration — more investment, more policy support, more stakeholder engagement.

When I reflect on 2007, the contrast is striking. Back then, I stood in rooms where people laughed at the idea that fryer grease could fuel planes. Today, the same people — or their successors — speak of UCO as indispensable. The laughter is gone, replaced by urgency. The dismissal has turned into demand. What changed was not the feedstock itself but the belief around it. Belief that it could be collected, that it could be certified, that it could be trusted. That belief was not given; it was built. It was built through years of persistence, through data, through presence, and through proving it again and again.

The story of UCO is not just about waste oil. It is about reimagining value. It is about taking something discarded and making it essential. It is about challenging entrenched assumptions and proving that alternatives are possible. It is about the stubborn conviction that sustainability is not only necessary but achievable — if we are willing to do the work.

Looking forward, I see UCO continuing to play this role — not as the sole solution, but as the anchor. It will remain the feedstock that underwrites credibility, that sustains momentum, that bridges us into a future of diverse SAF pathways. Malaysia will remain central to this story, not only as a supplier but as a leader. And FatHopes Energy will remain committed to the mission we began nearly two decades ago: to prove that waste is not waste, that transparency is power, and that persistence can turn the unthinkable into the indispensable.

As aviation races toward 2050, the stakes could not be higher. Climate change is no longer a distant threat; it is a lived reality. Aviation’s social license to operate depends on decarbonization. Passengers, policymakers, and investors are watching closely. In this context, SAF is not a choice but a necessity. And within SAF, used cooking oil is not an afterthought but a foundation.

To all stakeholders — governments, airlines, refiners, vendors, and consumers — the call is clear: act now. Collect every liter. Certify every drop. Invest in every depot, every refinery, every piece of digital infrastructure. Do not wait for the perfect solution. Do not wait for tomorrow’s technologies to mature. Use what we have today, and scale it. Because every liter of UCO-based SAF used this decade is a liter of fossil fuel avoided, a ton of CO₂ not emitted, a step closer to the net-zero future we owe our children.

The journey from 2007 to 2025 is proof that change is possible. The journey from 2025 to 2050 will determine whether it is enough. Let us ensure that when history is written, used cooking oil is remembered not just as a feedstock but as the unlikely hero that made sustainable aviation fuel possible.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEBMU2_HzH9Vw/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/B56ZmY_8B9JoAI-/0/1759208525471?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=4pFoW2ZyT6VZh6Sx5Duc9qu9yWl83EGcTpEC4t3PhN8,N,,2025-10-03 10:56:11.810237

Denver International Airport is not simply updating facilities; it is reimagining the role of airports in a sustainable, interconnected world.","Denver International Airport (DEN) is one of the most ambitious airports in the world today. Located on the high plains of Colorado, surrounded by the Rocky Mountains, Denver is not only the largest airport site in North America but also the second largest by landmass globally. Its size gives it unique opportunities, and equally unique challenges, as it seeks to redefine what a 21st century airport should look like.

With passenger numbers surging, infrastructure ageing and environmental responsibilities intensifying, Denver’s leadership has set out an ambitious vision: to become the greenest airport in the world, while managing growth. Leading this effort include Phil Washington, Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Oldham, Senior Director of Asset Management, who together are shaping Denver towards a sustainable, technologically advanced future.

Declaring a green ambition

When Phil Washington assumed the role of CEO nearly four years ago, he made a decisive statement of intent: Denver Airport would become the world’s most sustainable airport.

“One of the first things I declared was that we wanted to be the greenest airport in the world,” Washington explained. “So, we immediately took action. Expanding our solar array, plugging 54 abandoned oil wells on airport property, and pushing forward partnerships with airlines on sustainable aviation fuel.”

These early interventions have already yielded visible results. The capped wells removed a legacy environmental hazard from the site, while the expanded solar infrastructure significantly boosted renewable capacity. Washington is quick to acknowledge, however, that sustainability at Denver is an ongoing process rather than a finished goal.

“We are well on our way, but there’s a lot more to do,” he admitted. “Every new project, every new system we implement, is viewed through a sustainability lens.”

Cutting carbon, saving energy

One of the most impactful measures has been Denver’s performance energy contract. An initiative designed to drive efficiency across the airport’s growing facilities. This includes simple but effective technologies, such as automated lighting systems that switch off when rooms are unoccupied, and broader upgrades to heating, ventilation and energy systems.

“These improvements will save us millions of dollars over the next decade,” Washington said. “But they also reduce reliance on fossil fuels, cutting emissions in line with our goal of reducing greenhouse gases by 80% by 2050.”

The push towards sustainability is multifaceted. Denver is actively transitioning its vehicle fleet to electric models, exploring advanced generator technologies that meet stricter environmental standards and pursuing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) collaborations with carriers. Together, these initiatives represent a comprehensive strategy to future-proof airport operations against both economic and climate pressures.

Land as a strategic advantage

A defining feature of Denver Airport is its size. With more land than any other airport in the world except one in Saudi Arabia (King Salaman International Airport), Denver is uniquely positioned to explore large-scale sustainability projects.

“Because we have so much land, we can set an example for the entire world in terms of sustainability,” Washington noted. “It gives us the flexibility to trial renewable energy, rethink infrastructure layouts, and invite private-sector innovators to use our airport as a proving ground.”

This open approach is formalised through the Centre for Equity and Excellence in Aviation (CEEA). A new initiative with three pillars: career development, research and innovation, and business development.

The CEEA has three core missions, all designed to expand aviation’s role in both the local and global economy:

Career pathways: creating structured opportunities for young people from surrounding communities to enter aviation professions, whether as pilots, aircraft mechanics, or engineers.

Research and innovation: studying aviation ‘megatrends’ such as climate change, demographic shifts and technological disruption, while welcoming private companies to bring forward new sustainability ideas.

Business development training: supporting historically underutilised businesses through a nine-week academy, equipping them with the knowledge to compete in the aviation supply chain.

“We’ve already started the curriculum,” Washington explained. “And we’re building a dedicated brick-and-mortar facility that will be complete by the end of 2025. This is about preparing the workforce and the industry for the future.”

CEEA also extends Denver’s ambitions internationally. As part of efforts to establish direct flights to Africa, Washington envisions the centre as a vehicle for knowledge exchange: “If we launch routes to Ethiopia, Ghana, or Senegal, we don’t just connect people, we share infrastructure expertise and training that can help develop aviation in those countries too.”

Asset management: planning for the next 30 years

This is where Brian Oldham’s asset management expertise comes in. Since joining Denver two years ago, Oldham has implemented a risk-based asset management programme with a 30-year timeline.

“The programme lets us prioritise replacements based on business risk,” Oldham explained. “We can predict when assets will fail, how much it will cost, and which year we’ll need to replace them.”

A critical tool in this strategy is Denver’s Operational Readiness and Transition (ORAT) programme, ensuring every new system or facility is seamlessly integrated into operations from day one. Staff training, operational manuals and asset data are all secured before handover, avoiding delays and gaps in knowledge.

This forward-looking philosophy is changing the way airports approach infrastructure. As Oldham emphasised: “Asset management isn’t just a maintenance tool, it’s a way of thinking. It’s about life-cycle planning and predictive capability.”

Both Washington and Oldham believe technology will transform airport operations. Denver is investing in IoT sensors to collect real-time data from across the airport, feeding into AI systems that can predict failures before they happen.

“We want to know when an asset is going to break down, not chase after it once it has,” Washington stated. “By combining conditional assessments with AI, we can create a predictive environment that keeps our infrastructure reliable.”

Oldham added that AI and machine learning will be vital for handling the complexity of Denver’s mix of ageing and newly built assets: “We can build models that say, ‘The last three times this pump failed, these four events occurred in the two weeks beforehand.’ That insight changes everything.”

Exploring nuclear power: a radical energy solution

Perhaps the boldest idea on the table is Denver’s exploration of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) to meet future power needs. The airport currently consumes about 50 megawatts of power, but projections suggest it will need 400 megawatts by 2045.

“There’s not an easy way to achieve that growth with traditional sources,” Oldham explained. “SMRs could allow us to meet our own demand, provide heating for facilities, and even sell surplus power back to the grid.”

The concept is still in its infancy in the US, with studies ongoing, but international examples are emerging. If realised, Denver could become the first airport in the world powered by nuclear energy, making it both 100% green and fully energy self-sufficient.

As of August 2025, the airport has Request for Proposals (RFP) to study the feasibility of building a small modular (nuclear) reactor (SMR) on the airport’s campus.

Washington sees it as consistent with the airport’s role as a pioneer: “We have the land and the ambition to trial bold solutions. Nuclear could be part of a future that makes aviation both cleaner and more resilient.”

The challenges ahead

Despite progress, challenges remain. Oldham pointed out that many airports are only beginning to grasp the true value of asset management. “Some think a maintenance management system equals asset management. It doesn’t. It’s just a tool. Asset management is a philosophy.”

Meanwhile, Washington emphasised that growth pressures will continue to test DEN’s capacity: “We’re one of the few airports simultaneously expanding and refurbishing at scale while passenger numbers keep rising. That’s not easy.”

Both agree that communication, between internal stakeholders, contractors, regulators, and the public, will be critical in maintaining transparency and trust throughout Denver’s transformation.

Denver International Airport is not simply updating facilities; it is reimagining the role of airports in a sustainable, interconnected world. From solar power and electric fleets to predictive AI systems and even the possibility of nuclear power, DEN is setting new benchmarks in innovation and environmental stewardship.

As Washington reflected: “We have the land, the ambition and the partnerships to make Denver the greenest airport in the world. With innovation and collaboration, we’ll get there.”

Oldham echoed the sentiment from an infrastructure perspective: “If we get life-cycle management right from day one, we’re not just saving costs, we’re building resilience for the next 30 years and beyond.”

Together, their vision presents not only a roadmap for Denver, but a potential blueprint for airports worldwide facing the dual challenges of ageing infrastructure and rising demand.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/DIA-peaks.gif,N,,2025-10-03 11:59:17.907042

Notably, Delhi was chosen as the pilot site as Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat refinery supplies aviation turbine fuel to a dedicated depot meant for the airport through a pipeline.
Overall, SAF plays a pivotal role in the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).
“India has the capacity to become a global leader in SAF production,” the Minister asserted, adding that SAF production in India is projected to exceed domestic demand, thereby positioning the country as a major exporter.
Currently, India’s refining capacity enables it to export 50 per cent of its aviation turbine fuel (ATF) production.","India is set to launch a pilot project to make sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) available at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport.

In technical terms, SAF refers to renewable or waste-derived jet fuel that meets sustainability criteria.

Recently, Indian Oil Corporation received certification to produce SAF at its Panipat refinery.

The SAF blend will be produced by using the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway, with feedstock such as used cooking oil or even rice straw (parali).

Notably, Delhi was chosen as the pilot site as Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat refinery supplies aviation turbine fuel to a dedicated depot meant for the airport through a pipeline.

“That is the beauty of SAF. You don’t have to change the infrastructure to implement it. It’s like fossil fuel,” said Jane Hupe, Deputy Director, Environment Branch, Air Transport Bureau, UN body International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Huge advantage

Hupe pointed out that the existing pipeline gives India a huge advantage, as it avoids the need for costly new transport and distribution systems.

“So, the infrastructure that they already have to produce and distribute the fuel to the airport can also be used for SAF, and that’s a big plus for this technology,” Hupe told businessline.

Overall, SAF plays a pivotal role in the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This scheme is being implemented in three phases, with participation voluntary between 2021 and 2026.

India has chosen not to participate in the voluntary phases. However, offsetting requirements under CORSIA for Indian carriers will begin in 2027.

The scheme applies to international flights originating from one country and landing in another.

Indicative targets

Accordingly, the Centre plans to implement the scheme with indicative targets of a one per cent SAF blend in ATF starting in 2027, increasing to two per cent in 2028, and eventually reaching five per cent by 2030.

In addition, India is in the process of framing a comprehensive policy to promote both the production and utilisation of SAF.

Last month, speaking to businessline, Union Civil Aviation Minister K. Ram Mohan Naidu emphasised that India holds a natural advantage in this segment.

“The first advantage is our geography, which allows us to become an exporter, and the second is the massive availability of feedstock,” Naidu said.

At present, India has over 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 230 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue that can be used to produce SAF.

“India has the capacity to become a global leader in SAF production,” the Minister asserted, adding that SAF production in India is projected to exceed domestic demand, thereby positioning the country as a major exporter.

Currently, India’s refining capacity enables it to export 50 per cent of its aviation turbine fuel (ATF) production.

“So it is natural for us to pursue this subject, given our commitment to sustainability,” he said.

She emphasises how CO₂-derived solutions can succeed where past alternatives failed by combining scalability with functionality and cost-efficiency. On the aviation front, she highlights LanzaTech’s unique positioning across multiple Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) pathways, backed by regulatory momentum in the U.S., EU, India, and China. She underscores the role of policy levers—from carbon pricing to long-term offtake agreements—in accelerating carbon-based SAF to commercial parity with fossil jet fuel. Looking ahead, Dr Jennifer Holmgren envisions a 2035 where airlines fly on CO₂-derived fuels and supermarket shelves carry carbon-based palm oil substitutes, marking a decisive shift toward a circular carbon economy.

LanzaTech has long been synonymous with carbon-to-fuels. With this palm oil alternative, you’re now reshaping supply chains beyond energy. How did this pivot emerge, and what does it signal about LanzaTech’s evolution ?

The pivot from a focus strictly on carbon-to-fuels to reshaping broader supply chains emerged as LanzaTech identified the critical need and opportunity for sustainable alternatives in global markets dependent on high-impact raw materials like palm oil. We have previously worked on chemicals such as ethylene that play a key role in the textiles space. This strategic shift signals LanzaTech’s evolution from a company focused solely on carbon recycling for energy purposes to a broader provider of sustainable solutions across various industries. It reflects a response to the need for systemic changes in supply networks that extend beyond energy.

Palm oil is arguably one of the world’s most entrenched commodities. Why do you believe this innovation could succeed where decades of alternatives have struggled ?

The unique aspect of this innovation lies in its ability to meet the functional needs of industries currently dependent on palm oil, coupled with a sustainable production method. Decades of alternatives have struggled due to scalability, cost-efficiency, or failing to meet functional requirements. LanzaTech’s technology leverages carbon waste as a feedstock, which is abundantly available, from waste CO2 to agricultural and forestry residues, thereby potentially undercutting the economic and environmental costs of palm oil production while maintaining the needed chemical properties.

The SAF market is projected to hit $250+ billion by 2050. Where does LanzaTech’s platform fit into that growth compared to legacy SAF technologies ?

LanzaTech is exceptionally positioned to capitalise on the burgeoning $250+ billion SAF market by 2050, thanks to our ability to engage with all key SAF production pathways, including Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ), Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), and Power-to-Liquid (PtL). Unlike legacy SAF technologies that often depend on specific feedstocks or face scalability limits, our versatile platform utilizes industrial off-gases and waste carbon, converting them into ethanol—a flexible and scalable intermediary for SAF production. This approach aligns perfectly with evolving global regulations that prioritize waste and residue-based fuels. By integrating into diverse markets and adapting to varied regulatory and raw material landscapes, we’re not just participating in the SAF market growth; we are actively driving it forward and setting new standards for sustainable aviation fuels.

Airlines are desperate for scalable, affordable SAF. What are the economics of CO₂-derived HEFA oils versus conventional feedstocks like palm, or soy ?

The economics of CO₂-derived HEFA oils could prove advantageous compared to conventional feedstocks due to lower raw material costs (captured carbon versus agricultural products) and potentially lower processing costs. These factors, combined with increasing regulatory support for low-carbon alternatives, could make CO₂-derived oils a scalable, affordable option for the aviation sector.

With the U.S. and EU offering billions in SAF subsidies and blending mandates, what policy levers are still missing to bring carbon-based SAF to parity with fossil jet fuel ?

Price Stabilisation Mechanisms: Establishing floor prices or minimum subsidy guarantees can stabilize the market and attract sustained investments.

Enhanced Tax Credits and Incentives: Increasing the value or duration of tax credits for carbon-based SAF could accelerate adoption and infrastructure investments.

Carbon Pricing: Implementing a robust carbon pricing system for fossil fuels can make SAF more economically viable by reflecting the true cost of carbon emissions.

Streamlined Regulatory Approvals: Simplifying the approval process for new SAF facilities can reduce the time and cost of market entry.

Public-Private Partnerships: Encouraging collaborative efforts between the public sector, private industry, and academia can share risks and facilitate technological exchange.

Long-term Offtake Agreements: Government-led long-term agreements can provide SAF producers with market stability and financial predictability.

Global Alignment on SAF Standards: Harmonizing international SAF standards can reduce compliance costs and facilitate global trade.

These policy adjustments can create a more favorable environment for carbon-based SAF, helping bridge the gap to fossil jet fuels and supporting the aviation sector’s transition to sustainable practices.

Europe is tightening deforestation-linked import bans; the U.S. is ramping up SAF credits. How do regulatory tailwinds in different geographies shape your commercialization roadmap ?

The EU’s mandate of a 2 per cent blend of SAF escalating to 6 per cent by 2030 creates a sizable, stable demand for SAF, particularly beneficial for LanzaTech’s recycled carbon fuels. Furthermore, the specific sub-mandate for e-SAF (PtL) channels LanzaTech into a niche but growing segment of the SAF market, especially as green hydrogen availability increases, allowing us to extend our offerings in the EU market.

The UK’s increasing SAF mandates, expected to reach 10 per cent by 2030, combined with a specific cap on HEFA-feedstock SAF and a premium placed on advanced SAF solutions like ours, tailor a unique advantage for LanzaTech.

India’s evolving SAF mandate, which anticipates a rise to 5 per cent by 2030, opens a new and burgeoning market for LanzaTech’s fuels derived from industrial off-gases and waste biomass. Our products qualify under the National Biofuels Policy, positioning us to be a key player in helping India achieve its SAF targets while supporting our expansion strategy in a highly populous and growing aviation market. By increasing the production of biofuels from waste carbon including agricultural residues, India can reduce its dependency on oil imports and promote energy sufficiency. This aligns with the Government of India’s targets under the National Biofuel Policy, aiming to increase the blend of biofuels in the energy mix.

Each region’s specific policy approach guides our focus and commercial exertions, enabling us to adapt and prioritize product lines and collaborations that align with regional SAF demand projections and policy incentives. This targeted approach enhances our ability to capitalize on emerging opportunities for growth and impact in the global SAF market.

How close are we to a carbon circular economy ?

With innovations like the palm oil substitute, we’re moving closer to a carbon circular economy by displacing ecologically harmful commodities. Transforming wastes into valuable products aligns with rethinking carbon as a resource, and promoting utilization of recycled carbon. There are several ways India’s unique agriculture sector can benefit from embracing these innovative technologies.

India generates a substantial amount of agricultural residues, like straw from rice and wheat, which often get burnt, contributing to severe air pollution issues, especially in Northern India. LanzaTech’s technology can convert these residues into valuable products such as ethanol, which can then be used to produce SAF or other biochemicals. This not only helps in reducing air pollution but also adds an economic value to what is otherwise considered waste.

By setting up bio-refineries that leverage local agricultural residues, there can be significant job creation in rural areas and the use of ethanol and other byproducts from bio-refineries can incentivize sustainable agricultural practices.

Will fossil and deforestation-linked commodities still dominate by 2035 ?

By 2035, I envision a world where airlines predominantly use CO₂-derived fuels and supermarket shelves are lined with sustainable, CO₂-based palm oil substitutes (and recycled carbon replaces virgin fossil carbon throughout!). This scenario is not just feasible; it’s within our grasp with continuous technological advancements and favorable regulatory environments.

We are pioneering a shift towards a circular carbon economy, turning carbon waste into a valuable resource. Our commitment to innovation and collaboration is paving the way for global transformations in both the aviation sector and consumer markets. Achieving this vision will depend on the scale of deployment, strong global partnerships, and maintaining an economic advantage over traditional commodities. Together, we are setting a legacy of sustainability, ensuring ecological responsibility and economic prosperity coexist, spearheading a sustainable era for generations to come.",https://agrospectrumindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sustainable_aviation_fuel_wallpaper.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 11:59:31.088700

Uzbekistan has committed to becoming carbon-neutral by the end of the decade, and the Khorezm biorefinery is expected to play a central role in that transition. By producing zero-carbon fuels for transport and industry, the project aims to reduce fossil fuel dependency and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

Rakhimov welcomed the decision to site the project in Khorezm, highlighting its significance for regional development. He stated that the initiative will create hundreds of skilled jobs, strengthen Khorezm’s position as a hub for green energy, and boost the local economy. Rakhimov also pledged to personally oversee the allocation of land and infrastructure needed to ensure successful implementation.",https://timesca.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/photo_2025-10-03_15-21-09.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 11:59:51.622416
