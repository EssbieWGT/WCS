Top media outlets, CNN, BBC, The New York Times, Reuters, and The Wall Street Journal remain trusted sources globally. Each continues to adapt to digital platforms while upholding core journalism values: accuracy, impartiality, and transparency.

As per the latest media reports and surveys, the following media outlets have stood out in 2025, delivering excellence and credible news.

CNN remains a global leader in breaking news and real-time reporting, with a strong international presence and digital reach.

BBC is recognized for its journalistic integrity, impartiality, and expansive global network, making it one of the most trusted and fastest-growing news websites.

The New York Times continues to set editorial standards with investigative journalism and in-depth analysis, maintaining a vast digital subscriber base and global influence.

Reuters is a primary source for unbiased business, financial, and world news, with a massive global footprint and syndication to other outlets.

The Wall Street Journal is a key resource for business and financial insights, trusted by professionals and recognized for its factual reporting and market analysis.

Misinformation spreads rapidly online. So trust is more critical than ever, and readers certainly prefer unbiased news. Such reporting not only builds public confidence but also keeps governments, institutions, and corporations accountable.

However, as media shifts from print to digital, its environmental impact also evolves. So here we would discuss the carbon footprint of these media giants and their sustainability efforts to meet net-zero targets.

The Media Industry’s Carbon Footprint

While switching from print to digital cuts down paper waste, it also creates carbon emissions. Online publishing, video streaming, and real-time updates rely on large data centers that use a lot of energy.

Thus, the carbon footprint of media outlets, especially those with significant digital and streaming operations, has become a major environmental concern.

Research from Futuresource and InterDigital estimates that the TV and video streaming industry accounts for 4% of total global emissions.

Print editions, like those from The New York Times, still generate emissions from production and delivery. Meanwhile, parent companies like Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN) are adopting renewable energy and reducing waste across operations.

Also, AI-driven reporting cuts travel emissions but adds energy demand. To remain sustainable, the media industry must invest in green data infrastructure and transparent carbon reporting.

1. CNN Rides Warner Bros.’ Green Goals

CNN hasn’t published a standalone carbon footprint or its own emissions report. However, its parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, has committed to clear sustainability goals that influence CNN’s operations.

Digital Shift Drives Emissions

CNN runs energy-heavy operations, including streaming, news gathering, and data centers. Its shift to digital-first content reduced paper waste but increased electricity use.

Streaming, a key part of CNN’s digital platform, drives global demand for data. Experts estimate that video streaming alone may cause up to 1% of global carbon emissions.

Thus, CNN benefits from its parent company’s broader sustainability plan. Warner Bros has taken steps to cut environmental impact and lower greenhouse gas emissions by:

Invested in renewable energy and energy efficiency across operations

Support industry-wide environmental standards

Rolled out waste reduction initiatives across its media brands.

Leading with Climate Coverage

CNN plays a vital role in climate journalism. It consistently reports on climate change, carbon emissions, clean energy, and sustainability innovation.

Its stories spotlight technologies like carbon capture, sustainable aviation fuel, and renewable power, keeping the public informed and engaged. CNN also covers major policy moves, such as the EU’s push for sustainable aviation fuel and the global net-zero by 2050 target.

These company-wide actions help reduce CNN’s indirect environmental impact.

2. BBC Targets Net Zero by 2050 with Strong Emissions Cuts

The BBC aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, aligning with the UK government’s climate goals. It has outlined its environmental sustainability strategy, emphasizing its commitment to becoming Net Zero and Nature Positive.

It plans to cut direct emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) by 46% and value chain emissions (Scope 3) by 28% by 2030, using 2019/20 as the baseline. The SBTi approved both short- and long-term goals.

Its total emissions amounted to 374,063 tons CO₂e in 2023/24, up 7% from the 2019/20 total of 350,893 tons.

The increase is attributed to value chain emissions as they remain a growing challenge.

However, by 2023/24, it reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 21%, exceeding its target of 17%. It achieved this by upgrading buildings, cutting gas use, and reducing diesel in production.

Notably, the media company now requires all non-news TV productions to meet the BAFTA Albert sustainability standard. Producers must submit carbon action plans and measure emissions. As of January 2024, the BBC ended mandatory offsetting and redirected efforts toward direct decarbonization.

With these initiatives, they remain committed to sustainable operations and credible climate reporting.

3. New York Times’ (NYT) Emission-Cutting Strategy

The New York Times has taken steps to lower its environmental impact by improving energy efficiency across its facilities and using more sustainable methods in printing and distribution.

It measures its Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions using the financial control boundary method defined by the GHG Protocol. This approach helps identify emission sources and areas for reduction. The company bases its carbon reduction target on the GHG Protocol’s market-based method.

Between 2019 and 2023, the company reduced its purchased electricity use by 16%. However, Scope 2 location-based emissions rose by 18% during the same period. This increase mainly resulted from a less renewable power mix in New York City.

The company’s progress toward its carbon-neutral target depends, in part, on the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) reaching its goal of 70% renewable electricity by 2030 and a zero-emission grid by 2040.

4. Thomson Reuters: Climate Action and ESG Progress

Reuters operates in over 200 locations, providing accurate, fact-based reporting.

Thomson Reuters sees ESG as important for long-term success. The board oversees key ESG areas, but employees lead efforts in sustainability, inclusion, and community work.

It supports global standards like the UN Global Compact and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It also works to promote UN Goal 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions.

Environmental Commitments and Climate Goals

The company continues to reduce its global environmental impact by using 100% renewable electricity across all operations. This is done by matching energy use with renewable energy credits worldwide. Thomson Reuters also works with suppliers to lower emissions across its value chain.

In 2020, it joined the SBTi, and its key goals include:

Cutting Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 (from a 2018 baseline)

Reducing Scope 3 emissions from energy, travel, and commuting by 25% by 2025 (from a 2019 baseline)

Ensuring 65% of supplier spending aligns with science-based targets by 2025

Since 2020, it has sourced 100% renewable power and reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by over 93% from 2018 levels. Business travel emissions are down 63% from 2019. Currently, 41% of its suppliers (by spend) have committed to science-based climate targets.

Thomson Reuters uses carbon offsets for its remaining emissions and to stay carbon neutral. It also spends 7% of its U.S.-based budget with diverse suppliers and plans to maintain this level through 2024.

5. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Carbon Footprint Not Separately Reported

The Wall Street Journal is owned by Dow Jones & Company, which in turn is a subsidiary of News Corp.

There is no publicly available, standalone carbon footprint report specifically for WSJ as of 2025. Any emissions data or sustainability disclosures would be included under the broader corporate reporting of Dow Jones or News Corp, not as a separate WSJ-specific document.

News Corp aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, WSJ’s environmental impact is mainly from digital and print operations, but specific figures are not published.

A study from The Business Research Company revealed that the global media market is set for strong growth in 2025, rising from $2,616.7 billion in 2024 to $2,833.22 billion in 2025, with a CAGR of 8.3%.

This upward trend is expected to continue, reaching $3,814.84 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 7.7%.

Growth is fueled by a rising global population, rapid tech advancement, media mergers, and increased mobile video consumption.

Meanwhile, Statista projects the global digital newspapers and magazines segment will generate $41.28 billion in 2025, growing to $44.54 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 1.92%. The U.S. will lead with an expected $16.73 billion in revenue. Subscription-based models are gaining popularity as audiences seek premium content.

By 2025, trusted media outlets will go beyond reporting news. They will embrace digital transformation, fight misinformation, and work to lower their environmental impact. In an era defined by data and climate awareness, credibility and sustainability will define the media landscape.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_1925524166.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 13:56:07.231053

We have set out below an overview of the current regulatory frameworks governing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the key jurisdictions of the UK, EU and USA.

SAF has emerged as a critical component in the global drive to decarbonise the aviation sector, a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike conventional jet fuels, SAF offers substantial reductions in lifecycle carbon emissions by incorporating renewable feedstocks and innovative production technologies.

Recognising its potential to drive sustainable growth, policymakers across the UK, EU, and USA are actively shaping regulatory frameworks to accelerate its deployment and adoption.

Note that this is an evolving regulatory landscape that is subject to change – however, this overview sets out the current regulations and initiatives of each of the UK, EU and USA – and strongly indicates the direction of travel of each of these jurisdictions.

We conclude with a comparison of these jurisdictions and analyse their strengths and limitations in fostering market growth. We also examine potential pathways for future development, including harmonisation of international standards, technological advancements, and policy synergies.

By presenting such analysis and exploring projected trends, this overview offers insights into the role of regulation in shaping the trajectory of SAF as an essential enabler of sustainable aviation.

United Kingdom

The UK SAF landscape

Current Status and Future Developments

The UK's SAF industry is progressing rapidly, driven by a number of policy measures that integrate SAF into the UK's broader decarbonisation goals. With increasing regulatory and financial support, the UK aims to position itself as a global leader in SAF development, production, commercialisation and use.

A key component of this strategy is the SAF Mandate, alongside other legislative and market-based incentives designed to accelerate SAF adoption. Under these principles, SAF is defined based on achieving a minimum level of greenhouse gas emission reductions and specific sustainability criteria.

The key features include the introduction of compulsory, incrementally increasing SAF supply requirements, a buy-out mechanism to enforce compliance, and funding incentives to support industry growth.

The Jet Zero Taskforce (JZT) (building on the previous Government's Jet Zero Council) was announced by the UK Government in November 2024 to advance sustainable aviation. Members include UK Government ministers, industry leaders and academics. Established to accelerate the transition to net zero aviation by 2050, the JZT aims to streamline aviation decarbonization priorities and support the development, production, commercialisation and use of SAF in the UK and globally.

The UK is at the forefront of SAF development as the one of the first countries in the world to legislate for mandatory SAF requirements. The UK's key policy to decarbonize aviation and secure demand for SAF is the SAF Mandate.

SAF Mandate

Key terms (2025 onwards):

The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) Order 2024 came into force on January 1, 2025. This introduced compulsory SAF requirements for suppliers of at least 15.9 terajoules (c.468,000 litres) per year of aviation fuel to the UK: from 2025, SAF is required to make up 2% of the total UK aviation fuel mix, increasing to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

SAF suppliers earn Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates for SAF supplied to the UK that meets certain GHG emission reductions and sustainability criteria (SAF must comprise fuel that achieves minimum GHG emission reductions of 40% relative to traditional fossil fuel-based jet fuel). Evidence of the SAF supplied to UK needs to be provided to the Department for Transport to assess and award corresponding certificates. The number of certificates issued will be proportionate to the level of GHG emission reductions achieved by the fuel delivered (i.e. the greater the reductions, the greater the number of certificates issued). Suppliers can either use their certificates to demonstrate that they have complied with their obligations or trade them to other suppliers.

HEFA Caps (2027 onwards):

SAF produced through hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) can contribute 100% of SAF for the first 2 years of the Mandate and thereafter decreasing to 71% in 2030 and 35% in 2040.

This is due primarily to HEFA's emission reduction inefficiencies (when compared to SAF alternatives) and feedstock sustainability concerns.

Power to Liquid (PtL) Obligations (2028-2040):

A separate PtL obligation requires 0.2% of UK aviation fuel to be sourced from PtL commencing in 2028 and thereafter rising to 4.4% by 2040.

PtL requires energy-derived production of aviation fuels (from e.g. green hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide).

Buy-out Mechanism (2025 onwards):

Fuel suppliers unable to meet their SAF Mandate requirements must pay a buy-out price determined by their SAF or PtL shortfall amounts.

The aim is to create a financial incentive to prioritize SAF, with the buy-out prices (currently £4.70 per litre for SAF and £5.00 per litre for PtL) being set at a level to encourage the supply of SAF over the use of the buy-out.

SAF Revenue Support

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Revenue Support Mechanism) Bill (2024) was announced in the King's speech on 17 July 2024, proposing a revenue certainty mechanism for SAF producers investing in UK-based facilities. A number of funding options were proposed and, in January 2025, the UK Government confirmed that the Guaranteed Strike Price mechanism was the preferred option.

The Guaranteed Strike Price is envisaged to operate akin to a contract-for-difference (as utilised in the UK renewable power sector), offering price stability for UK SAF producers. The mechanism will operate through a private law contract between a UK SAF producer and a designated Government agency, establishing a strike price (being the guaranteed price the producer will receive for eligible SAF over a specified period). If the reference price surpasses the strike price, the producer reimburses the Government agency for the difference, and, if the reference price falls below the strike price, the Government agency compensates the producer for the shortfall.

In line with the ""polluter pays"" principle, the UK Government has confirmed that it intends for the revenue certainty mechanism to be funded by aviation fuel suppliers.

Further SAF Incentives

To further promote UK SAF development, the UK Government has implemented various financial incentives:

Advanced Fuels Fund: First launched in 2022 with £165 million of grant funding available, the Advanced Fuels Fund aims to support the establishment and development of first-of-a-kind SAF projects in the UK.

SAF Clearing House: Any new aviation fuel must meet strict specifications and undergo testing to meet industry standards; the cost and complexity of which can be a significant barrier to new fuels entering the market. The UK SAF Clearing House provides technical support and funding to SAF producers.

Furthermore, aircraft operators can reduce their obligations under the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) by using eligible SAF, which qualifies for emissions reductions under the scheme.

Projections and Insight

It is estimated that, by 2050, the global aviation industry will need approximately 400 million tonnes of SAF annually to meet international decarbonization goal and, whilst the SAF market is still in a nascent stage of its development, the UK is positioned to play a significant role in the global effort to decarbonize aviation. The development of SAF production facilities in the UK are key for the successful implementation of the UK Government's SAF goals.

The SAF Mandate has only just come into force and the revenue certainty mechanism for SAF producers has yet to be finalized and take effect. As such it remains to be seen whether these mechanisms will be sufficient to meet international decarbonization goals and position the UK as a leader in SAF development, production, commercialisation and use:

The success of the buy-out mechanism in incentivizing the production and use of SAF will depend on the future production costs of SAF. Whilst the buyout rates are currently projected to exceed SAF production costs, if the buy-out price is set too low (for example, if production costs spiral), suppliers may choose to simply pay the buy- out price.

With respect to the revenue certainty mechanism, there are a number of questions and policy decisions that remain outstanding: what will be used as the ""reference price"" (unlike in the power market where there is a published market price for electricity, no such benchmark exists for SAF)? How will the strike price adjust over time? Precisely how will the mechanism be funded? At a most fundamental level, the deployment of significant capital into SAF development will require further clarity regarding the revenue certainty mechanism.

For further clarity on the information above, we set out below (at Figure 1) a timeline of key projected regulatory developments in the UK SAF market.

European Union

The EU SAF Landscape

Current Status and Future Developments

Despite efforts to curb its growth, commercial flights in the EU could rise by up to 42% by 2040 compared to 2017. Recognizing the pressing need to address the climate impact of the aviation sector, the EU has prioritized the development of a SAF market. By leveraging the collective action potential of its member states, the EU is uniquely positioned to lead in SAF implementation.

SAF is defined by the EU as a ""drop-in"" aviation fuel, including advanced biofuels or biofuels produced from sustainable feedstocks, recycled carbon fuels, or synthetic fuels.

With mandates introduced in 2023 and effective as from January 2025, the European Union is meticulously crafting a policy framework to stabilize the SAF market, foster innovation, and create a level playing field, driving progress toward its Fit-to-55 climate goals.

Legislation

The European regulatory framework for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been shaped by two key legislative milestones: the Renewable Energy Directives (RED) and the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation.

The RED have progressively established binding renewable energy targets across the EU, including for the transport sector, and have increasingly integrated SAF into the broader energy transition strategy. From RED I (2009), which set initial renewable energy targets, to RED II (2018), which introduced incentives for SAF, and finally RED III (2023), which reinforced sector-specific mandates, these directives have paved the way for SAF regulation.

Complementing this framework, the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, adopted in 2023, marks a decisive shift in SAF development by imposing direct obligations on fuel suppliers at EU airports. Unlike the RED directives, this regulation is immediately applicable across the EU and imposes a progressive incorporation of SAF into jet fuel, with binding quotas extending to 2050. Together, these two instruments define the roadmap for SAF deployment, balancing long-term policy incentives with immediate regulatory requirements.

RED Directives

RED served as the cornerstone for establishing the EU's shift toward greener fuels.

Adopted on April 23, 2009, the RED I Directive introduced ambitious renewable energy targets across EU Member States:

General Targets: Each Member State was assigned a binding target to achieve 20% renewable energy in its final energy consumption by 2020. These targets varied for each country: Some countries were optimistic about their renewable energy potential and set ambitious targets, such as Sweden with 49% by 2020, Denmark with 30%, and France with 23%. Others, however, were more cautious, with the Netherlands setting a target of 14% and Italy aiming for 17%.

Transport Sector: A specific target of 10% renewable energy was set for the transport sector by 2020. This included biofuels and other renewable fuels but did not explicitly address aviation.

Impact on SAF: While RED I did not explicitly include SAF, it established a foundation for their future integration by defining sustainability criteria and promoting advanced biofuels.

Entering into force on December 11, 2018, the RED II Directive strengthened the EU's renewable energy framework in response to increased climate ambitions:

Revised Targets: The overall binding target for emissions reduction was raised to 32%, with a renewable energy target of 14% for the transport sector.

Promotion of SAF

AdvancedBiofuelsand RFNBOs:The RED II Directive encouraged the use of advanced biofuels and Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs), explicitly including SAF. Advanced biofuels refer to biofuels produced from feedstocks that do not compete with food production or contribute to land-use changes that could negatively impact biodiversity. They are typically derived from waste and residues, or non-food crops such as algae and plant fibers. As for RFNBOs, they are fuels produced from renewable electricity rather than biological sources.

IncentiveMultipliers

Biofuels derived from feedstocks listed in Annex IX (including advanced biofuels) count twice their energy content towards renewable targets, meaning that for every unit of energy produced from these fuels, it counts as two units towards the target.

Fuels supplied to the aviation sector (including RFNBOs) count as 1.2 times their energy content, meaning that for every unit of energy from these fuels, it counts as 1.2 units toward the target.

Limitations on Food-Based Biofuels: These are capped at 7% to mitigate adverse effects on land use and food production.

Adopted on October 18, 2023, the RED III Directive was a decisive step towards integrating SAF into the EU's energy framework, by:

Enhanced Targets: The share of renewable energy in the EU's overall energy consumption must reach 42.5% by 2030, with a binding target of 29% for the transport sector.

Sectoral Sub-Targets: Specific targets were introduced for advanced biofuels and RFNBOs, solidifying SAF's role as a cornerstone of aviation decarbonization.

Aviation Catalyst: RED III emphasized increased SAF integration into national energy strategies while supporting emerging technologies, such as synthetic fuels.

Directives are legal acts that generally need be transposed into national law by EU member states, meaning that each country must adopt its own legislation to achieve the directive's objectives. Therefore, the RED directives' provisions need to be transposed into national law. There is generally an 18-month deadline for member states to do so, with an occasionally shorter deadline for some provisions.

Member States successfully met the RED I targets, despite varying national goals, demonstrating the EU's commitment to renewable energy. This progress laid the foundation for the more ambitious targets in RED II and RED III, and Member States are on track to achieve these goals. In particular, the push for SAF under these directives is progressing well, with ongoing efforts to scale production and expand infrastructure. While challenges remain, Member States are well- positioned to meet the targets for both renewable energy and SAF by 2030, especially with the introduction of the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation.

ReFuelEU Aviation regulation

Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of October 18, 2023 through ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport (ReFuelEU Aviation) represents a cornerstone of the EU's strategy to decarbonize aviation in line with the Green Deal objectives and the Fit-for-55 package. This regulation establishes a comprehensive legal framework to accelerate the adoption of SAF across the EU.

Finalized in 2023, most of its provisions entered into force on 1 January 2024, with Articles 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 becoming applicable from January 1, 2025. As an EU regulation, ReFuelEU Aviation is directly applicable in all Member States without requiring transposition into national law.

The regulation imposes binding SAF blending obligations on aviation fuel suppliers, requiring them to progressively integrate SAF into the aviation fuel supplied at EU airports. The mandated SAF share begins at 2% in 2025 and will increase incrementally to 70% by 2050, of which a dedicated sub-target for synthetic aviation fuels starts at 0.7% in 2030, reaching 35% by 2050 (see Figure 2). For instance, the goal for 2040 is to achieve a 42% share of SAF in the aviation fuel supplied to EU airports, with 15% of that being synthetic.

To be eligible, SAF must comply with the sustainability and emissions reduction criteria set out in RED I. Acceptable SAF sources include advanced biofuels, synthetic fuels derived from renewable hydrogen, and recycled carbon aviation fuels. Fuel suppliers may also utilize hydrogen for direct aircraft propulsion or synthetic low-carbon fuels.

Within this regulatory framework, synthetic fuels—particularly e-kerosene—are set to play an increasingly prominent role, with a specific mandate ensuring their integration into the fuel mix.

EU airport operators are required to facilitate access to SAF, while aviation fuel suppliers, airports, and aircraft operators must systematically collect and report data to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and national competent authorities to ensure regulatory compliance.

The regulation further establishes enforcement mechanisms, designating national competent authorities responsible for supervision. Fuel suppliers failing to meet their SAF blending obligations will face financial penalties and must compensate for any shortfall by supplying the missing volume the following year.

By setting clear, long-term SAF quotas through 2050, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation creates a stable and predictable market framework, reinforcing the EU's ambition to achieve a more sustainable aviation sector.

Figure 2:SAF Mandate Levels in the ReFuelEU Directive

Incentives for SAF Production and Innovation

The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and Financial Incentives for SAF

In addition to the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, the EU's climate strategy for the aviation sector is reinforced by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), established under Directive 2003/87/EC. As a ""cap-and-trade"" mechanism, the EU ETS aims to progressively reduce greenhouse gas emissions by setting a cap on total emissions while allowing market- based trading of emission allowances. Initially, free allowances were allocated to aircraft operators based on the average emission of the sector and their historical performance. In 2023, approximately 22.5 million aviation allowances were allocated for free, while about 5.7 million were auctioned.

To accelerate decarbonization, the EU has initiated a phased reduction of free emission allowances for aircraft operators:

In 2024, free allowances were reduced by 25%;

In 2025, they will be further cut by 50%;

By 2026, all free allowances will be phased out, requiring operators to fully cover their emissions through auctioning.

This transition is designed to incentivize the adoption of SAF, as airlines can lower their compliance costs by integrating SAF into their fuel mix. To support this shift, the EU has introduced targeted financial incentives within the EU ETS framework:

A dedicated SAF allowance mechanism provides 20 million allowances (valued at approximately €1.7 billion) until 2030, rewarding aircraft operators based on SAF usage. This mechanism helps bridge the price gap between conventional aviation fuel and SAF. SAF remains significantly more expensive to produce. However, by reducing compliance costs for airlines under the EU ETS, it makes SAF adoption more financially viable, supporting the transition to cleaner aviation fuels while maintaining competitiveness in the sector.

SAF that meets RED sustainability criteria is attributed zero emissions under the EU ETS, reducing the number of allowances airlines must purchase.

Beyond emissions trading, the EU has also introduced monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) measures for non-CO₂ aviation effects, with additional policy proposals expected by 2028.

Financial Support Mechanisms for SAF Development

Recognizing the financial and technological challenges associated with SAF production, the EU has established several funding instruments to support research, innovation, and large-scale deployment:

EU Innovation Fund (EUIF): A €40 billion fund aimed at de-risking SAF production across various technology readiness levels. For example, the Innovation Fund awarded in 2023 a €167 million grant to the Biorefinery Östrand project, which seeks to develop, construct, and operate the world's first large-scale biorefinery dedicated to producing renewable SAF and naphtha, in Östrand, Sweden.

Horizon Europe: The EU's flagship €95.5 billion research and innovation program, which funds SAF-related projects.

InvestEU: A €26.2 billion initiative supporting sustainable infrastructure investments, including SAF production facilities. One of the most notable projects funded by InvestEU is the INERATEC synthetic fuel production facility in Frankfurt. Backed by a €70 million investment, this initiative is supported by a €40 million venture loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and a €30 million non-repayable grant from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. The funding will help develop Europe's largest carbon-neutral synthetic fuel plant, set to open in 2025.

Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking: A €1.7 billion public-private partnership between the European Commission and the aeronautics industry to accelerate the development of new aviation technologies.

Projections and Insight

While the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation establishes a robust framework and clear mandates for SAF adoption, several policy areas will require further clarification and potential amendments. The regulation's overall timeline is generally aligned with industry expectations, but additional interventions may be necessary to ensure a smooth and effective implementation:

Penalty enforcement and cost volatility: The current penalty mechanism for suppliers failing to meet SAF quotas is directly tied to SAF costs, which remain highly volatile due to potential supply shortages. If SAF prices surge, penalties could become unsustainable, adding financial pressure on suppliers while delaying compliance. Additionally, without a price cap mechanism, rising SAF costs could impact air travel affordability, potentially triggering public and industry backlash.

Exploring a tradable SAF system: Under Article 15 of ReFuelEU, the European Commission is mandated to assess additional measures to enhance SAF market liquidity and ensure supply stability. One key consideration is the creation of a book-and-claim system, which would enable fuel suppliers and aircraft operators to purchase SAF credits and allocate them flexibly across EU airports. As of January 2025, the Commission's report on these measures remains pending.

Beyond regulatory refinements, the political landscape in the EU is evolving, with recent electoral shifts favoring parties historically opposed to Green Deal policies. As EU policymakers shift their focus toward an Industrial Deal, maintaining strong momentum for SAF adoption will be critical. Ensuring a stable regulatory environment and continued financial support will be essential to securing the long-term success of SAF integration within the aviation sector.

The effectiveness of SAF regulations in the EU stems from the fact that they are binding, compelling operators to take immediate action and enhance their performance.

Despite its relatively high cost, airlines and operators are eager to contribute and even exceed their obligated SAF targets as early as possible. They understand that this is the only way to assert themselves in the market and to ensure the long- term sustainability and viability of the industry, which must adapt to greener practices to secure its future.

United States of America

The U.S. SAF Landscape

Current Status and Future Developments

Aviation represents roughly 3.3% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and jet fuel consumption is forecasted to increase by 2-3% annually through to 2050. This obviously presents significant opportunities for SAF investment, and the market has responded: projects have been announced in recent years that are projected to meet over 10% of U.S. jet fuel demand. Nonetheless, the biggest challenge SAF faces in the U.S. is that it is not cost-competitive with fossil jet fuel. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, SAF currently costs two to ten times more than fossil jet fuel. Consequently, the federal and state incentives discussed in this section are playing and will continue to play a critical role in the growth of SAF in the U.S.

Federal Support for SAF

The U.S. government supports SAF development in several ways: annual renewable fuel regulatory mandates; tax policy; and grants. Several of these incentives are in flux, however, given the shift in the balance of political power in the U.S. Congress and the White House.

Regulatory Mandates:

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issues annual regulations under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program that require the national pool of transportation fuel to contain a certain percentage of alternative fuels such as SAF. Production and use of biofuels under these mandates is tracked using a system of tradeable credits (Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs). Among other requirements, eligible SAF must have lifecycle GHG emissions that are at least 50% below a 2005 fossil fuel baseline.

Although compliance with the program's mandates falls on fossil fuel producers and importers, RINs implicitly subsidize biofuels such as SAF. Depending upon the feedstock and production process, SAF can generate RINs that may be used to meet the biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel or cellulosic biofuel mandates and value of the RIN varies by type. RINs generated by producing SAF can be ""stacked"" with federal tax credits for SAF, such as those provided by the 2022 IRA, as well as state credits relevant to SAF.

Tax Policy:

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) has a significant impact on the SAF market in the U.S. by offering comprehensive support to encourage the production and adoption of this fuel. Instead of setting mandates, the IRA offers SAF credits for qualified neat fuels and provides grants for SAF production and distribution.

The IRA supports SAF through two credits. First, IRA created a new SAF blender's tax credit under Internal Revenue Code section 40B, available through to the end of 2024. Then, from January 1, 2025 through to December 31, 2027, the IRA made available a new technology neutral production credit for clean fuels including SAF, the section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit.

The section 45Z credit provides a tax credit for the production of clean fuels that are ""suitable for use in a highway vehicle or aircraft"" and meet a specified threshold for emissions reductions. The credit is worth up to $1.00 per gallon for transportation fuels and $1.75 or more per gallon for SAF, provided that prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met. The 45Z credit is claimed by the producers of SAF, rather than the blenders, but can be transferred or sold to third parties as a means of monetizing the credit.

Since August 2022, significant work has been done by a multi-disciplinary task force including the U.S. Treasury, the IRS, the Energy Department, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the White House to implement the section 45Z credit and publish tax guidance. Most recently, on January 10, 2025, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released Notice 2025-10 and Notice 2025-11, establishing an intent to propose regulations and clarifying annual emissions rates for the credit. At the same time, the 119th Congress is currently reviewing tax legislation that may include revisions to several clean energy tax credits established by the IRA, including section 45Z. As a result, airlines, SAF producers, and conventional energy companies are queuing up to talk to Congress and Trump tax officials about the future of federal tax support for clean fuels, since the current production credit is set to expire at the end of 2027.

Grants:

IRA Section 40007 establishes a grant program for eligible U.S. entities involved in SAF production, transportation, blending, or storage, administered by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through the Fueling Aviation's Sustainable Transition (FAST) grants program.

Section 324 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for 2023 allows the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to pilot SAF usage, with a plan to be implemented by FY2028, while permitting waivers under certain conditions.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023 and 2024 authorize discretionary grants for airport infrastructure that supports SAF's distribution and storage, provided they meet the 50% lifecycle GHG reduction requirement.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Energy for America program also provides grants and loan guarantees to rural businesses and agricultural producers for renewable energy projects, including SAF production facilities.

State Incentives for SAF Production and Innovation

State-level policies further support SAF production and consumption by allowing producers to generate and sell credits to fossil jet fuel suppliers. In 2009, California established the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) to reduce transportation sector GHG emissions in the state and develop a range of low- carbon and renewable alternatives to reduce petroleum dependency. This market-based program sets an annual average carbon intensity (CI) benchmark for all fuels – fossil and renewable – produced or imported into the state. Fuels with a CI below the benchmark (such as eligible SAF) generate credits that producers can sell to other fuel producers in the state as a revenue stream. Oregon, Washington, and New Mexico have adopted similar fuel programs.

In other states – Illinois, Minnesota, and Nebraska – per-gallon SAF production tax credits promote SAF alignment with national objectives.

Projections and Insight

By 2030, domestic SAF production is expected to reach 3 billion gallons annually – a 130-fold increase from 2030 consumption. By 2050, production could rise to 35 billion gallons per year, reflecting a 12-fold increase from the 2030 target.

The shift towards SAF represents a long-term transition in the aviation industry. Given the international nature of air travel, SAF is a clean fuel whose market drivers are largely insulated from the political swings of the US; and American airlines and airports will need to access this fuel to comply with global emissions standards. Driven by discretionary grants from the FAA, significant investments in airport infrastructure for SAF distribution and storage are anticipated. This could lead to an improved supply chain and logistics, facilitating broader SAF availability at major airports by 2025. Increased funding through grants and tax credits may accelerate research and development of new SAF feedstocks and production technologies, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs. This could also lead to advancements in alternative feedstocks, potentially doubling production efficiency by 2030. As government initiatives and incentives ramp up, it is likely that the market share of SAF in total jet fuel consumption will increase significantly from the current less than 0.1%. Projections estimate reaching 5 -10% market share by 2030, depending on regulatory support and industry adoption.

The incentives enacted under the IRA constitute a good beginning in establishing the support necessary for overcoming barriers to SAF adoption. With investors comparing the short three-year timeline of the IRA's section 45Z clean fuel production credit to ten-year timelines for other clean energy technologies, producers and airlines are making a long-term legislative extension of the credit a top priority for 2025. State level initiatives, like the California LCFS program, look to play a critical role in driving SAF adoption. Other states may follow suit, creating a patchwork of supportive policies that could incentivize producers while also fostering competition among states for SAF leadership.

Conclusion: Comparative Analysis of SAF

Regulatory Frameworks in the UK, EU, and US

The regulatory approaches adopted by the UK, EU, and US to promote SAF reflect distinct policy priorities, economic

structures, and aviation market dynamics. Whilst all three jurisdictions recognize the need to scale SAF production to achieve net-zero aviation emissions, their methods for incentivization, mandate enforcement, and industry engagement exhibit some notable divergences.

Key Similarities

Despite differences in policy mechanisms, several overarching themes emerge across all three jurisdictions:

Mandatory Blending Requirements: The UK, EU, and US each employ a mix of blending mandates and incentives to encourage SAF adoption. The UK's SAF Mandate (starting at 2% in 2025 and increasing to 22% by 2040) aligns with the EU's ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which also begins at 2% in 2025 but escalates to 70% by 2050. Although the US lacks a direct federal blending mandate, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and state-level Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) programs create market-driven demand for SAF.

Financial Incentives: Each jurisdiction incorporates financial incentives to lower SAF's production costs and bridge the price gap with fossil-based jet fuel. The UK's proposed Revenue Support Mechanism, the EU's SAF Allowance Mechanism under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), and the US's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits all aim to de-risk SAF investment. Notably, the US offers the most aggressive tax-based support via the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which directly rewards SAF producers.

Technology-Specific Targets: Recognizing the need for diversification in SAF production pathways, the UK and EU establish dedicated quotas for Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels and synthetic fuels, whereas the US allows greater flexibility in feedstocks, as seen in its Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and LCFS programs. The UK's PtL obligation has similar aims to the EU's sub-target for synthetic fuels, indicating a shared commitment to emerging technologies.

Market-Based Compliance Mechanisms: Each jurisdiction incorporates a credit trading system to enhance compliance flexibility. The UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs), the EU's ETS allowances and (if to be applied) book-and-claim system, and the US's RIN (Renewable Identification Number) market under the RFS facilitate compliance while stimulating a secondary market for SAF credits.

Key Differences

Despite these similarities, the jurisdictions differ in several key respects:

Direct v Market-Based Approach:

The EU and UK impose direct mandates on fuel suppliers, ensuring binding obligations for SAF blending. The UK's buy-out mechanism acts as a penalty for non-compliance, while the EU enforces fines and requires compensation for missed SAF quotas.

The US primarily relies on market-driven incentives, with no direct SAF blending mandate at the federal level. Instead, state-based programs such as California's LCFS and financial incentives like the IRA credits encourage voluntary SAF adoption.

Policy Longevity and Stability:

The EU offers the longest regulatory certainty, with ReFuelEU Aviation's SAF mandates extending to 2050. The UK's SAF Mandate provides clarity through 2040 but leaves open questions regarding future expansion.

The US approach is, potentially, more politically vulnerable. The IRA's Section 45Z tax credit is set to expire by the end of 2027, raising questions about long-term investor confidence. This contrasts with the EU's more predictable long-term regulatory trajectory.

Scope of SAF Eligibility and Feedstock Restrictions

The UK and EU impose stricter sustainability criteria, progressively limiting HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) (or similar) feedstock eligibility. The UK caps HEFA at 92% by 2027, declining to 35% by 2040, while the EU limits food-based biofuels to prevent indirect land-use impacts.

The US allows broader feedstock eligibility, including corn ethanol-derived alcohol-to-jet SAF, which the EU explicitly excludes. This reflects the political influence of the US agricultural sector, leading to a pragmatic approach to scaling SAF production with available resources.

Enforcement Mechanisms and Market Oversight

The EU employs oversight through the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and national regulatory bodies, ensuring strict compliance through direct penalties. The UK SAF Mandate will be administered by the UK's Department for Transport and will be responsible for enforcing the scheme with power to revoke certificates or issue civil penalties.

The US relies on tax compliance mechanisms and voluntary participation in state-based LCFS (or similar) markets, which, as an incentive-driven approach results inleading to comparatively less stringent enforcement as can be expected in the EU and UK.

Comparative Insights and Future Implications

Each jurisdiction's SAF strategy reflects its unique regulatory philosophy and economic priorities. The EU's highly structured, mandate-driven approach aims to achieve rapid SAF integration but places cost burdens on fuel suppliers and buyers. The UK's hybrid model, combining mandates with revenue support mechanisms, seeks to balance regulatory certainty with investment incentives. Meanwhile, the US favors a market-driven, incentive-based model, fostering innovation but opening up potential regulatory uncertainty due to shifting political landscapes.

This evolving landscape reflects a multi-faceted approach, balancing stringent emissions reduction targets with mechanisms that incentivise investment and production. The UK has introduced ambitious mandates within its Jet Zero strategy, while the EU's Fit-to-55 package integrates SAF quotas through the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative.

Meanwhile, the USA leverages tax credits and grant programs under initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act to stimulate domestic SAF production. These diverse regulatory tools aim to address the significant challenges of scaling SAF, including high production costs, limited feedstock availability, and infrastructure constraints.

Looking ahead, international policy harmonization will be critical to ensuring the global scalability of SAF. The International Civil Aviation Organization and industry stakeholders may push for greater alignment between EU- style mandates and US-style incentives, potentially influencing future SAF policies. Additionally, ongoing bilateral agreements between the UK, EU, and US on carbon accounting, emissions reporting, and SAF certification will play a crucial role in fostering a globally integrated SAF market.

Despite their differences, the UK, EU, and US share the common goal of scaling SAF production to enable a net zero aviation future. While their paths to achieving this differ, their collective efforts will be instrumental in driving the technological and economic transformation needed for sustainable aviation. As regulatory frameworks evolve, continued cross-border collaboration and policy adjustments will be essential to maximizing SAF's impact on global decarbonization goals.",http://www.mondaq.com/images/MondaqThumb.png,N,,2025-05-26 09:56:32.998635

The Air Force plans to use the plane both as a military cargo transport and as a long-range refueling aircraft.
Both of these grants are in support of the company’s main contract with the Air Force.
This coming week, it faces a critical design review in conjunction with the Air Force and NASA.
JetZero also plans to target the air freight market, with a plane similar in interior design to the military transport.","The future of commercial aviation could be taking shape inside a hangar next to Long Beach Airport.

This is where Long Beach startup JetZero Inc. is developing a “flying wing” aircraft that’s shaped like a B-2 Stealth Bomber, can seat up to 250 passengers and fly across the country using up to 50% less fuel.

If successful, the new plane would mark the first fuel-efficient aircraft to hit the mainline commercial aviation market. Many of the prior efforts to produce more energy-efficient aircrafts have involved zero-emission or hybrid power trains; they are initially using smaller planes aimed at the short-haul market with a range of less than 500 miles.

“Until now, there’s been no next-generation plane in the middle-market, capable of carrying up to 250 passengers and traveling in the 3,000-mile to 5,000-mile range,” said Tom O’Leary, JetZero’s chief executive. “Ours is the most efficient airplane possible at this time.”

Interest from airlines

Instead of focusing on the engine or the powertrain of the plane, JetZero is concentrating on the overall design. This means the all-wing configuration that has greater lift and improved airflow to reduce drag, thereby achieving up to 50% fuel savings compared to the conventional tube-and-wing design of all commercial jets flying today. And because the jet engines are mounted on top, much of the noise they generate would be deflected away from the ground.

On the inside, the all-wing configuration allows for larger cabin space and more varied seating arrangements, improving passenger access and comfort. These include wider pathways, modular setups, more entrances and exits, and higher ceilings that allow for more carry-on luggage capacity, among other things.

“Just changing the shape of the aircraft addresses every major need this industry faces,” when it comes to reducing fuel costs and improving the passenger experience, O’Leary said.

He added that all this can be done using existing engines and equipment.

Already three major commercial airlines have either invested in, or placed orders with, JetZero, even though the first test flight of the aircraft, known for now as the Z4, isn’t planned until late 2027:

• Alaska Airlines, a unit of Seattle-based Alaska Air Group Inc., announced last summer it was investing in JetZero. The investment includes an option to place an order for an unspecified number of JetZero planes;

• Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc. announced in March it was also investing an unspecified sum in JetZero; and

• Chicago-based United Airlines Inc. announced in late April that it is also investing an unspecified sum in JetZero; its investment includes a path to order 100 JetZero aircraft with an option to purchase another 100 planes.

Air Force contract

These deals are just on the commercial side. Since 2023, JetZero has also had a $235 million contract with the United States Air Force to fast-track the development of a full-scale demonstration plane. The Air Force plans to use the plane both as a military cargo transport and as a long-range refueling aircraft.

“Right now, the most critical need for the Air Force is for a longer-range refueling aircraft,” O’Leary said.

The Air Force has been deploying in recent years the Boeing KC 46 Pegasus refueling tanker based on the Boeing 767 aircraft, with a range of up to 7,000 miles, though considerably less with a full payload. O’Leary said JetZero’s aircraft, would use up to 50% less fuel than the KC 46, allowing for a significant boost in range. This could be crucial as the Air Force and other military branches try to boost their force projection to the Western Pacific to counter the rising military threat from China.

Under this contract, JetZero has committed to having a demonstrator plane ready for a test flight by the end of 2027.

JetZero also has a $9 million grant from NASA and an $8 million grant from the Federal Aviation Administration. Both of these grants are in support of the company’s main contract with the Air Force.

Billions needed

In all, including both the federal contracts and the airline investment, JetZero has raised more than $300 million to date. O’Leary said the company is in the midst of a series B raise with a target “well into the nine-figure range.”

But it’s going to take billions of dollars to produce enough planes to meet the potential orders that have already been announced.

“We’re talking in the range of $5 billion to $10 billion,” said Ben Marcus, co-founder and managing partner of Up.Partners, a Santa Monica-based venture capital and venture studio firm that helps build companies.

JetZero is not the only company in the race to develop a flying wing.

San Diego-based Natilus Inc. is developing two such planes. Known as the Kona, one aircraft would be for regional cargo flights. The other one, called Horizon, would be for the airline passenger market. The Horizon aircraft, unveiled last fall, would have a passenger capacity of about 200 and a range of about 3,000 miles, enough to cover most transcontinental flights. These aircraft would use about 25% less fuel than traditional planes. Natilus has said it is targeting 2030 for the first commercial flights.

Given this, JetZero has a lot riding on the 2027 test of its full-scale demonstrator plane that it’s preparing to build. This coming week, it faces a critical design review in conjunction with the Air Force and NASA.

“The moment that demonstrator plane flies, it will unlock a lot of capital,” Marcus said.

But if the demonstration test falls behind schedule or is not fully successful, then JetZero could lose its edge in the race to come up with a more fuel-efficient plane for the transcontinental market.

All-wing design dates back 30 years

The benefits of an all-wing configuration have long been recognized for its increased surface area to generate more lift and improved air flow that reduces drag. Sporadic attempts were made at various points over the past 100 years, but the tests either failed or the concept abandoned as the wing-and-tube design took hold.

The most serious effort at what became known in the industry as the “blended wing” approach took place in the early 1990s at McDonnell Douglas (since acquired by Boeing Co.), in partnership with NASA and Stanford University. That effort went as far as the successful test of a 17-foot scale model. But McDonnell Douglas and then Boeing declined to invest the capital necessary to develop and test a full-scale plane.

“The major aircraft manufacturers have little incentive to invest in something as revolutionary as this because it has such potential to cannibalize their existing business,” Marcus said.

Since aircrafts can have lifespans of up to 30 years, if the prospect of a new and better technology is in the offing a few years out, airlines may be unwilling to buy new conventional aircraft, he added.

That leaves the field open to new players – provided they can raise the capital.

In 2020, Mark Page, who led the McDonnell Douglas design effort, teamed up with O’Leary, a serial entrepreneur in both the aviation and auto industries, to launch JetZero.

Dual-market approach

The new company targeted both the commercial and the military markets from the outset.

On the commercial side, Marcus said there has been a growing frustration among commercial airlines about the lack of environment-friendly alternatives to traditional aircraft. He noted that at European airlines especially, there have been increased incidents of “flight shaming,” where environmentally-conscious consumers have targeted greenhouse gas emissions from planes. Switching to biomass-based sustainable aviation fuel has yielded only incremental benefits and is still more expensive than conventional fuel, he said.

Another factor spurring airline interest since the pandemic has been the delay in getting new conventional tube and wing planes into operation as Boeing has grappled with multiple issues, including quality control, supply chain disruptions and a culture that has been sharply criticized for not focusing enough on safety. All this has led to a backlog of nearly 11 years from the time an order is received to delivery of the plane, according to a recent analysis from Forecast International. (Airbus, the European manufacturing consortium, has a similar backlog.)

JetZero also plans to target the air freight market, with a plane similar in interior design to the military transport.

Early 2030s for first commercial flights

O’Leary said that assuming the 2027 test flight for the Air Force is successful, the next target will be FAA certification for commercial use. “We hope to achieve that by the end of 2030,” he said.

After that, assuming sufficient funds can be raised to scale up the manufacturing process, the first all-wing planes could be put into service by airlines in the early 2030s.

“It is going to be a gradual process,” he said.

The hope is that 10 years from now, the number of JetZero-made planes will number in the low hundreds – “enough that general passengers will use them on a regular basis.”",https://labusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PG01_JetZero_Tom_OLeary_pcThomWasper19-copy.jpeg,N,,2025-05-26 09:57:00.574278

“Infinium’s Project Roadrunner marks a huge achievement for the fuel industry,” said CEO Robert Schuetzle, highlighting its economic and environmental benefits. With support from investors Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, the facility promises to bring skilled jobs to Texas and help solidify U.S. leadership in energy innovation.

eFuels, made from waste CO2 and renewable energy, can replace petroleum-based fuels without changing engines or infrastructure. Infinium made history in 2023 with Project Pathfinder in Corpus Christi, becoming the first to ship commercial eFuels to the U.S. and Europe.

Roadrunner has secured major commercial agreements and financing, including 150 MW of wind energy from a NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary. Electric Hydrogen will supply its 100 MW HYPRPlant for green hydrogen production.

eFuels Set to Power Sustainable Aviation with Global Backing

The Roadrunner project will serve both U.S. and international markets. Under a deal with IAG, eSAF will be shipped to the UK to meet the UK SAF Mandate, requiring 10% of jet fuel from sustainable sources by 2030. “This represents a real step forward in the production of sustainable aviation fuel at scale,” said IAG’s Jonathon Counsell.

Commercial operations are expected by 2027 and backers say the project is a model for how next-gen climate tech can scale quickly. Brookfield’s Laura Hellman called the investment a strategic move to decarbonize aviation, while BE Catalyst’s Mario Fernandez praised the project’s finance-readiness.

North Dakota plant also in the works for Infinium

The company is also working on a site to be constructed in either North or South Dakota. In February 2025 it signed a deal with Summit Carbon Solutions that would potentially provide up to 670,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year for its planned eFuels plant in one of the two states.

Although they can be carbon neutral, e-fuels are the most expensive option due to high carbon capture and electrolysis costs.
Camille Mutrelle, an aviation policy officer at Transport & Environment, believes e-kerosene could drastically reduce aviation sector's carbon footprint.
Unlike bio-based SAF, which is limited by feedstock availability and land use concerns, e-kerosene can be scaled up sustainably to meet aviation fuel demand without competing with food production.
Twelve's first commercial demonstration plant, AirPlant One, is set to open in Washington state this year, with plans to produce 50,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel annually.","Sustainable aviation fuels are broadly classified into two types: bio-based SAF and e-SAF.

Bio-based SAF is made from organic materials like used cooking oil and agricultural waste, while e-SAF (also called electrofuels or e-kerosene) is made from renewable hydrogen and CO2 captured from the air.

Although they can be carbon neutral, e-fuels are the most expensive option due to high carbon capture and electrolysis costs.

Camille Mutrelle, an aviation policy officer at Transport & Environment, believes e-kerosene could drastically reduce aviation sector's carbon footprint.

Unlike bio-based SAF, which is limited by feedstock availability and land use concerns, e-kerosene can be scaled up sustainably to meet aviation fuel demand without competing with food production.

However, e-fuels are still more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

Carbon capture fuels provide an eco-friendly alternative to conventional biofuels, which are often based on monoculture crops such as sugarcane.

These crops can negatively impact biodiversity and compete with food production.

E-fuels use CO2 from the atmosphere or industrial emissions, along with hydrogen obtained from water through electrolysis with renewable electricity.

The end product is a synthetic jet fuel that can be used in current aircraft engines, recycling carbon instead of contributing more to the atmosphere.

California-based start-up Twelve is leading the charge with its low-temperature CO2 electrolysis method.

The energy-efficient process transforms CO2 and water into synthetic gas, the building block of synthetic fuel.

According to representatives at Twelve, these ""air-based fuels"" can cut emissions by up to 90% compared to fossil jet fuel—without the environmental toll of drilling, refining, or transporting oil.

Twelve's first commercial demonstration plant, AirPlant One, is set to open in Washington state this year, with plans to produce 50,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel annually.

United Airlines is a major supporter of this initiative. The company has also signed a deal to supply 260 million gallons of SAF over 14 years to Europe's International Airlines Group (IAG).

Despite the promise of e-fuels, moving from fossil fuels to genuinely sustainable aviation is a complicated affair due to current investments in oil, politics, and regulatory speed.

The deal was signed in Hanoi during French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Vietnam. Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao and Airbus International President Wouter van Wersch signed the agreement in the presence of both President Macron and Vietnamese President Luong Cuong, reported Travel and Tour World.

This new order is part of Vietjet’s long-term plan to grow its international flights. The new wide-body aircraft will allow the airline to increase the number of flights on busy routes across Asia and begin new long-distance routes, including to Europe.

Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao said that Vietjet will continue to grow with support from modern Airbus aircraft, which help the airline save fuel and operate more efficiently. She added that the airline is committed to offering more travel options and environmentally friendly services to people around the world.

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry from Airbus said Vietjet is one of the world’s fastest-growing airlines and that Airbus is proud to support the airline’s future growth.

Vietjet currently operates 115 narrow-body aircraft from the Airbus A320 series and seven A330-300 aircraft. With the addition of the 40 new A330-900 planes, the airline is preparing to increase both short and long-distance services. The airline already flies to countries like Australia, India, and Kazakhstan using its existing A330s. These routes are important for business and tourism, and Vietjet plans to use the new aircraft to serve even more destinations.

The A330-900 aircraft can fly up to about 13,300 kilometers without stopping. They are designed to use less fuel and produce fewer emissions. The inside of the aircraft also offers more space, better lighting to reduce jet lag, and modern entertainment and internet access, helping passengers enjoy long trips more comfortably. Vietjet’s business class on these planes includes more comfortable seating and improved service.

The aircraft can also fly using up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which helps reduce the environmental impact of air travel. Airbus hopes to make all of its aircraft capable of using 100% SAF by 2030. Vietjet’s order supports this goal and reflects the airline’s plan to grow while being more environmentally responsible.

Airbus has received more than 1,800 orders for its A330 aircraft from over 130 airlines worldwide. For Vietjet, the new order is a clear sign of its ambition to move beyond the regional market and become a major international airline.

'Aviation is in its fourth revolution. After mastering flight, ensuring its safety and making air travel accessible, the next frontier for aviation is decarbonisation,' postulated Airbus in its briefing ahead of the company’s recent summit on the future of sustainable aviation.

Julie Kitcher, Chief Sustainability Officer and Communications at Airbus, stated boldly all Airbus aircraft are already certified to fly with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This has the potential to reduce lifecycle CO₂e emissions by up to 80% on average for their Scope 3 emissions, claims the company.

The next generation of Airbus aircraft are pledged to fly with a blend of up to 100% SAF.

But Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Hudson was clear that to continue this trajectory, government has an important role to play in driving demand and supply. Kitcher pointed to a 'chicken and egg situation' because SAF is three-to-five times the price of kerosene.

She described the alcohol-to-jet-fuel SAF innovation as 'promising' and noted mixed-blend SAF can be developed at scale without needing new refineries, but there is still a 'green premium'.

There needs to be a 'convergence of innovation and capital', she said. 'This is an opportunity to develop a new industry.'

Ilona Sitova, Vice Chair of FABEC SC ESO MUAC, asserted, 'We are not policymakers…We do our best to share our knowledge.' She saw a need for those in government to take a leap of faith. She believes if policymakers set the pace, then industry will find ways of keeping up. 'We do need someone to set the pace here and say, guys, get this done.'

Hudson added, 'I think the consumer of the future is going to make choices based on sustainability.'

Jimmy Samartzis, Chief Executive Officer of LanzaJet, believed there is a 'need [for] scalability, supportive policy and risk-happy capital'. Although he is encouraged by what he sees, he still felt things are moving too slow. Asserting, 'someday is now'.

Booking a ticket

In a step towards scaling SAF adoption, Airbus is testing a ‘book and claim’ approach to boost supply and demand within the sector. The system allows a buyer to ‘book’ a certain amount of SAF and claim the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere.

Through a pilot programme running throughout 2025, Airbus seeks to improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those with limited volumes and far from supply points.

The first memorandum of understanding was signed by SMBC Aviation Capital, followed by AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment and SAF Aerogroup.

Airbus will purchase SAF certificates and manage the associated sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognised sustainability certification body. These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft operators, thereby stimulating short-term demand for SAF.

Elena Schmidt, Executive Director at RSB, believes ‘book and claim’ makes SAF more affordable and accountable.

While Julia Fidler, in charge of environmental sustainability, carbon reduction, fuels and materials decarbonisation at Microsoft, suggested the ‘book and claim’ system will enable long-term contracts to be signed for SAF.

Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, added, 'Supporting the SAF ‘book and claim’ mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market.

'For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to SAF can be challenging depending on the amount of SAF needed. Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and derisk the process for operators and SAF suppliers, by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them.

'This is also a great opportunity to demonstrate ‘book and claim’ is reliable and its usage should be extended in voluntary and regulatory markets.'

Gabrielle Walker, Co-Founder and Chief Scientist at CUR8, a platform that helps global companies buy and manage carbon removals, asserted there is 'massive capacity for development in all parts of the world. Don’t forget how expensive it is to do nothing.'

Counteracting contrails

Mark Bentall, Head of Research and Technology at Airbus, shed light on another milestone for the firm in assessing contrail formation and the impact of fuel composition on particle emissions.

There are flights with atmospheric payloads on board, but these cannot measure what is left in the air once the aeroplane has landed, causing uncertainty about impact.

Steven Barrett, Regius Professor of Engineering at Cambridge University, asserted, 'This is not the Manhattan project.'

Airbus, within a consortium of 10 partners from four European countries, has launched PACIFIC (Particle emissions, air quality and climate impact related to fuel composition and engine cycle) to study the aviation sector’s non-CO₂ emissions with a focus on contrails. The results will support future fuel specifications and policy recommendations.

Recent studies suggest the use of SAFs could reduce both soot particles and contrail ice crystals. However, additional information on fuel composition and its processing in the engine is necessary to better understand the effects and benefits of SAFs.

The project will test a range of fuels under controlled conditions, with consistency in combustion parameters and hardware. Lab-scale experiments at the German Aerospace Center will extend to full-aircraft engine tests at Airbus Toulouse in France.

The research will focus on understanding how soot forms during fuel combustion, using improved prediction tools to better anticipate its presence in engine emissions.

It will also analyse the quantity of fine particles released at different engine power levels, refining methods to estimate their impact from ground tests to real flight conditions.

Another key aspect is assessing how these particles contribute to ice crystal formation, a major factor in contrail development, using advanced measurement techniques.

Finally, the project will evaluate the broader climate effects of these emissions by examining how different fuel compositions and engine settings influence contrail formation and properties, and their impact on global warming.

The Hydrogen Blue Condor experiment is now being analysed. Results are anticipated for the fourth quarter of the year.

Barrett noted, 'We have a strong research base for a generation of research', but he encouraged action rather than burying their heads in the sand. Barrett shared how the current data suggests contrail elimination will mitigate about 2% of global warming. Adding that even if this is wrong and the benefit is small, it might be worth the risk.

However, changing one flight path to mitigate contrail impact has a ricochet effect, so it is not a simple process and may create a safety and capacity issue.

While ironically, the summit highlighted how older, less-efficient aircraft create more heat and, conversely, fewer contrails, so more efficient aircraft will necessitate contrail-avoidance mechanisms. Further research will enable the industry to respond on a tactical basis.

A foldable flight future

Sue Partridge, Airbus Commercial Aircraft UK Country Manager and Head of its Wing of Tomorrow Programme, highlighted the need for wing designs to be longer and slenderer for improved performance, but this had been constrained by gate size. She revealed Airbus was designing foldable wings.

Airbus is also proposing advances in propulsion. It is working with CFM International on the Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) open-fan engine demonstrator, which aims to show how this technology could reduce fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions by 20% compared to today’s most efficient single-aisle engines. Airbus plans to flight test RISE on its A380 aircraft by the end of the decade.

They are also working on advancing hybrid-electric propulsion, which supplements conventional jet fuel or SAF with electricity from batteries or fuel cells.

The EcoPulse demonstrator, a joint project between Airbus, Daher and Safran, gave significant insight into the use of lithium-ion batteries onboard an aircraft with a high-voltage network. While the potential of solid-state batteries is also being explored.

High hopes for hydrogen

Airbus reconfirmed its commitment to bring to market a commercially viable hydrogen aircraft. It presented some of the key technology building blocks at the summit that will enable the advent of a fully electric, fuel-cell powered, commercial aircraft – a pathway they say stands out as the most promising, following years of research into hydrogen aviation.

Airbus Head of Future Programmes, Bruno Fichefeux, said, 'While we’ve adjusted our roadmap, our dedication to hydrogen-powered flight is unwavering. Just as we saw in the automotive sector, fully electric aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells have the potential in the longer term to revolutionise air transport for the better, complementing the SAF pathway.'

These technologies were showcased as part of a new, notional concept of a hydrogen aircraft powered by four, 2MW, electric-propulsion engines, each driven by a fuel cell system that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. The four fuel-cell systems would be supplied via two liquid hydrogen tanks.

Airbus Head of the ZEROe Project, Glenn Llewellyn, added, 'Over the last five years, we have explored multiple hydrogen-propulsion concepts, before down-selecting this fully electric concept.",https://www.iom3.org/static/7552e0d6-35c6-43a2-bc8621c8f22c8428/opengraphimage_83f4e8796336604b59d7216d0ecd81a5_4a7c7e45a350/shutterstock2300524269.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 09:57:47.049602

Vietnamese low-cost carrier Vietjet has finalized a major deal with Airbus for twenty A330-900 widebody jets, reinforcing its long-term strategy to grow internationally over the next ten years.

The agreement was formalized in Hanoi, where Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao and Airbus International President Wouter van Wersch signed the order. The contract exchange took place during the official visit of French President Emmanuel Macron, witnessed by both him and Vietnamese President Luong Cuong.

This significant fleet addition marks a pivotal step in Vietjet’s broader expansion roadmap. The widebody aircraft will empower the airline to boost frequency on heavily traveled routes across the Asia-Pacific and lay the groundwork for launching new long-haul services, including anticipated future connections to Europe.

Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao said: “Modern Airbus aircraft, with the latest levels of efficiency and lower fuel consumption, have accompanied Vietjet’s growth and will continue to support our global flight network expansion. Vietjet remains dedicated to delivering greater connectivity and sustainable air travel for millions of passengers and around the world.”

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, EVP Sales Commercial Aircraft at Airbus said: “Vietjet has established itself as one of the fastest-growing airlines in the world, bringing low fares with warm Vietnamese hospitality. We are proud that the carrier has selected the A330neo as its widebody aircraft of choice to build on its success, and we look forward to continuing our partnership as Vietjet expands its reach.”

Vietjet Doubles A330neo Order to Forty Aircraft in Strategic Expansion of Its Long-Haul Ambitions

Vietjet is making bold moves to solidify its position in the global aviation market by doubling its firm order for the Airbus A330neo wide-body aircraft. The Vietnamese low-cost carrier has now committed to a total of forty A330neo aircraft, marking a significant expansion from its previous order. This strategic decision not only enhances Vietjet’s long-haul capabilities but also reflects its broader vision to transform from a regional operator into a formidable player in international markets.

This new order complements Vietjet’s existing order of ninety-six A320neo Family aircraft, demonstrating a balanced approach in building both short-haul and long-haul operations. Currently, the airline’s operational fleet consists of one hundred fifteen Airbus A320 Family narrow-body aircraft and seven A330-300 wide-bodies, underscoring its strong and exclusive relationship with Airbus. Vietjet’s reliance on an all-Airbus fleet ensures operational consistency, cost efficiency, and simplified maintenance procedures—key factors for sustained profitability and growth.

Vietjet’s A330-300s are already active on several popular international routes, including long-haul destinations such as Australia, India, and Kazakhstan. These routes are particularly significant as they align with the airline’s goal of tapping into high-demand travel corridors and meeting the needs of both leisure and business travelers. Onboard, passengers benefit from a premium experience, especially in Business Class, where they enjoy superior comfort, more spacious seating, and a wider selection of inflight services. Vietjet’s commitment to customer satisfaction is evident in how these wide-body aircraft are configured to elevate the overall flying experience.

With its expanding A330 fleet, Vietjet is positioning itself to capture a larger share of the international air travel market. The A330-900, which is part of the Airbus A330neo family, represents the latest in aviation technology. It is powered by advanced Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines and offers an extended range of up to 7,200 nautical miles—or about 13,300 kilometers—on a single flight. This range allows Vietjet to connect Vietnam with far-flung global destinations without compromising on efficiency or fuel economy.

Inside, the A330neo features the cutting-edge Airspace cabin—Airbus’s signature design known for maximizing passenger comfort and setting new standards in cabin experience. The Airspace interior offers wider seats, increased personal space, larger overhead bins, customizable ambient lighting to reduce jet lag, and access to the latest in inflight entertainment and high-speed connectivity options. These features make long-haul travel more enjoyable and underscore Vietjet’s aspiration to provide premium experiences at low-cost prices.

Environmental responsibility is also a key aspect of the A330neo’s appeal. The aircraft is built with sustainability in mind and is currently certified to fly using up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus has set a goal to achieve 100% SAF capability by the year 2030, aligning with global efforts to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint. Vietjet’s choice of the A330neo fits within this broader framework, helping the airline reduce emissions while expanding operations.

As of April 2025, Airbus had received more than 1,800 orders for the A330 Family from over 130 airlines worldwide. The popularity of the aircraft reflects the confidence airlines have in its versatility, efficiency, and passenger-friendly features. For Vietjet, doubling its A330neo order is not just a fleet expansion—it is a statement of intent. The airline is clearly preparing for a new phase of growth, one that will see it compete more aggressively in long-haul markets while offering enhanced services and maintaining its cost-competitive edge.

With global air travel continuing to rebound and expand, Vietjet’s investment in the A330neo is both timely and visionary.

Montevideo | BioEconomía* | Todo El Campo | La escena podría parecer salida de una novela de ciencia ficción ecológica: residuos de construcción convertidos en combustible para aviones. Pero no se trata de una utopía, sino de una realidad en desarrollo en Japón, donde Sumitomo Forestry y Rengo Co. se han aliado para producir bioetanol a partir de madera, con el objetivo de abastecer la creciente demanda de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

Sumitomo Forestry, uno de los mayores conglomerados japoneses en gestión forestal, arquitectura sustentable y desarrollo de viviendas de madera, aportará los residuos provenientes de sus obras de construcción. Por su parte, Rengo Co., una histórica empresa con sede en Osaka dedicada al packaging, el reciclaje de papel y el desarrollo de materiales de biomasa, liderará el desarrollo tecnológico y la producción.

BIOETANOL A PARTIR DE MADERA: HOJA DE RUTA Y ESCALA INDUSTRIAL

El proyecto contempla establecer una alianza estratégica entre ambas compañías para diciembre de 2025, con vistas a alcanzar una producción anual de 20.000 kilolitros de bioetanol a partir de 2027. La materia prima serán residuos de madera certificada según el esquema internacional Corsia (**), lo que garantiza su origen sostenible para el uso en aviación.

La conversión del material lignocelulósico a etanol se llevará a cabo utilizando tecnología desarrollada por Biomaterial in Tokyo, una filial de Rengo especializada en innovación química a partir de biomasa. La producción tendrá lugar en la sede y planta de Taiko Paper, otra subsidiaria de Rengo que actualmente se dedica a fabricar papel para embalaje y reciclar residuos industriales.

MÁS QUE BIOCOMBUSTIBLE: UN MODELO CIRCULAR.

Lo que distingue a esta iniciativa es su ambición de ir más allá del biocombustible. En paralelo al etanol, se generarán subproductos como lignina, un componente clave de la madera que podría transformarse en pinturas residenciales y otros insumos para la construcción sostenible. De este modo, las empresas buscan cerrar el ciclo del uso de recursos forestales, maximizando su aprovechamiento en línea con los principios de la bioeconomía circular.

UNA TENDENCIA QUE CRECE.

El interés japonés por el bioetanol no se limita a esta alianza. A comienzos de este año, Nippon Paper Industries -una de las mayores compañías papeleras del país- se unió a Sumitomo Corporation, gigante del comercio y la inversión internacional, y a Green Earth Institute (GEI), una empresa biotecnológica que desarrolla tecnologías fermentativas para convertir biomasa en productos renovables. Juntos formaron la empresa Morisora Bio Energy.

El objetivo de esta nueva sociedad es construir una planta semi-comercial en la fábrica de Nippon Paper en Iwanuma, en la prefectura de Miyagi. Allí se emplearán recursos forestales sostenibles de la región de Tohoku -como restos de aserraderos- para producir más de 1.000 kL de bioetanol al año a partir de 2027, utilizando procesos fermentativos patentados por GEI.

LECCIONES DE JAPÓN: ¿PUEDE EL RESIDUO FORESTAL SER ORO LÍQUIDO?

Este doble avance muestra una hoja de ruta clara: con infraestructura, tecnología y visión, los residuos de madera pueden transformarse en un activo clave para la transición energética. El enfoque integral de empresas como Sumitomo Forestry y Rengo, sumado a las capacidades biotecnológicas de GEI, plantea un nuevo paradigma donde el bosque no solo da sombra y madera, sino también energía limpia para volar.

En un mundo que necesita soluciones urgentes para descarbonizar el transporte, el ejemplo japonés propone una alternativa concreta, replicable y sustentable: mirar al residuo como el punto de partida de la innovación.

A relatively new plant to Australia called Carinata is changing the biofuels industry, and trials are happening now west of the Great Dividing Range.

Cotton growers have been giving it a go as a rotation crop.

The results are pretty golden so far.

Carinata oil, when refined, is considered a 'drop-in' replacement for existing fossil fuels: the biofuel can be used without updating or retrofitting current machines, and blends with existing fossil fuels.

Biofuels: replacement fossil fuels, usually bioethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels, made out of sustainable biogenic resources. Everything from wood offcuts, to agricultural by-products, used cooking oil or beef tallow and even algae can be turned into biofuels.

Queensland Government's definition of Biofuels

Cream of the Crop

Carinata looks similar to canola; bright yellow flowers on towering green stems.

It's grown in winter and suits drier soil types.

It boasts lower water needs than Canola, due to a longer rootstock.

The crop is being pitched as an emerging option for broadacre farmers over winter.

Having a 'cover crop' is being adopted by many growers looking to reduce topsoil losses, in between their traditional cropping seasons.

The oil from the Brassica family plant is classed as non-food: unlike Canola, it can't be consumed by humans.

Harvest and crushing

Currently, once matured and harvested, Carinata is shipped to Europe for processing. There are no operational processing facilities in Australia yet.

The grain is processed into two products: biofuel, and high protein plant feed for stock.

Biofuel use has already been written into EU's aviation fuel regulations, and Asia has indicated it will follow.

In Australia, Qantas has committed to using 10% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in its overall fuel mix by 2030.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Produced from sustainable feedstocks and is very similar in its chemistry to traditional fossil jet fuel.

BP's definition of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The aviation industry has shown serious interest in Carinata-derived biofuel.

Plant Power

The plant's pre-commercial trials in Australia are being overseen by Nufarm.

Rachel Palumbo is Nufarm's Global General Manager for seeds, and is hopeful Australia could become a world-leader.

""Australia has the land, resources, and expertise to lead in renewable fuels, sustainable agriculture, and homegrown manufacturing,"" she said.

""In South America, farmers already produce low-carbon fuel at scale. With the right support Australian growers can do the same.

Growers benefit from having a profitable break crop that improves soil health

Government support needed

Earlier this year, the Australian Government announced it would invest $250 million into low-carbon liquid fuels.

""This funding will drive innovation and open new opportunities for farmers to supply feedstocks like Carinata,"" Ms Palumbo said.

The Queensland Government has also shown interest in the blooming industry, recently commissioning Deloitte to review global SAF markets.

The 2024 report found:

""Australia's SAF industry is still in its infancy and this is unlikely to change on the scale needed to support decarbonisation without government intervention and a proactive industry.""

Ms Palumbo also pointed to government-driven SAF mandates as a crucial step to fostering a local biofuels industry.

Για την παραγωγή του η HelleniQ Energy προωθεί τη δημιουργία μονάδας για «πράσινα» αεροπορικά καύσιμα με παραγωγή 150.000 τόνων ετησίως, ποσότητα που υπερβαίνει τις ανάγκες της ελληνικής αγοράς γεγονός που σημαίνει ότι σημαντικές ποσότητες θα κατευθυνθούν σε εξαγωγές.
Στον ναυτιλιακό τομέα, η Helleniq Energy έχει ξεκινήσει την παραγωγή μείγματος ναυτιλιακού καυσίμου (mazut) με βιοντίζελ, χρησιμοποιώντας αποκλειστικά απορρίμματα ελαίων.","Με τα ορυκτά καύσιμα να καλύπτουν περίπου το 50% του παγκόσμιου ενεργειακού μείγματος το 2050 και τον OPEC να προβλέπει ότι η παγκόσμια ζήτηση πετρελαίου θα αυξηθεί κατά 1,45 εκατ. βαρέλια/ημερησίως το 2025 και κατά 1,43 εκατ. βαρέλια/ημερησίως ημέρα το 2026, οι ελληνικές εταιρίες διύλισης στο πλαίσιο της ενεργειακής μετάβασης και ακολουθώντας τους κανονισμούς της ΕΕ, προετοιμάζονται για την παραγωγή «πράσινων» καυσίμων όλων των κατηγοριών.

Σύμφωνα με εκτιμήσεις του κλάδου η αυξανόμενη ζήτηση καυσίμων τα επόμενα χρόνια θα οδηγήσει σε αύξηση των επενδύσεων έως το 2030, παρά το γεγονός ότι τη διετία 2023-2024 σημειώθηκε σημαντική κάμψη.

Τα «πράσινα» καύσιμα αναμένεται να βρεθούν στο επίκεντρο αυτών των επενδύσεων καθώς η πρόσμιξη τους στις βενζίνες, το ντίζελ, τα αεροπορικά καύσιμα και τα καύσιμα ναυτιλίας, αποτελεί υποχρέωση που επιβάλλουν οι κανονισμοί της ΕΕ όχι μόνο για τους χρήστες αλλά και για τους παραγωγούς που πρέπει να προετοιμαστούν κατάλληλα.

Αεροπορικά καύσιμα

Στο επίκεντρο των συζητήσεων αυτή την περίοδο βρίσκονται τα «πράσινα» αεροπορικά καύσιμα μέσω της εφαρμογής του ευρωπαϊκού κανονισμού ReFuelEU από το 2025, με αρχικό ποσοστό πρόσμιξης SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) 2%. Το ποσοστό αυτό προβλέπεται να αυξηθεί στο 6% το 2030, για να φθάσει σταδιακά στο 70% το 2050.

Οι ελληνικές εταιρίες διύλισης HelleniQ Energy και Motor Oil ήδη από τις αρχές του 2025 διαθέτουν αεροπορικά καύσιμα με πρόσμιξη 2% SAF.

Μάλιστα η HelleniQ Energy από το 2021 εφάρμοσε ένα πιλοτικό πρόγραμμα διαθέτοντας καύσιμα με πρόσμιξη SAF στην Aegean για τις πτήσεις της από το αεροδρόμιο Μακεδονία της Θεσσαλονίκης. Το καύσιμο προέρχονταν αρχικά από τη φιλανδική εταιρεία Neste, αλλά ο ελληνικός όμιλος συνεργάζεται πλέον με ολοένα και περισσότερους προμηθευτές.

Το SAF είναι αεροπορικό καύσιμο που παράγεται από ανακυκλωμένα έλαια, λίπη, ή οργανικά απόβλητα και μπορεί να μειώσει τις εκπομπές έως και κατά 80%, χωρίς να απαιτείται τροποποίηση στους κινητήρες των αεροσκαφών.

Για την παραγωγή του η HelleniQ Energy προωθεί τη δημιουργία μονάδας για «πράσινα» αεροπορικά καύσιμα με παραγωγή 150.000 τόνων ετησίως, ποσότητα που υπερβαίνει τις ανάγκες της ελληνικής αγοράς γεγονός που σημαίνει ότι σημαντικές ποσότητες θα κατευθυνθούν σε εξαγωγές. Η μονάδα θα βασιστεί σε πρώτες ύλες όπως τα υπολείμματα τροφών, τα τηγανόλαδα και τα ζωικά λίπη, ακολουθώντας το ευρωπαϊκό μοντέλο που αποκλείει προϊόντα που ενδέχεται να επιβαρύνουν την τροφική αλυσίδα.

Παράλληλα στη Θεσσαλονίκη, η HelleniQ Energy δημιουργεί το Green Hub North Project το οποίο στοχεύει να εξελιχθεί σε κόμβο παραγωγής υγρών καυσίμων χαμηλού άνθρακα, ενσωματώνοντας παραγωγή HVO, βιο-αιθέρων, πράσινου υδρογόνου, καθώς και εγκαταστάσεις αποθήκευσης και ΑΠΕ. Εξάλλου η επεξεργασία πρώτων υλών φυτικής προέλευσης στις υπάρχουσες μονάδες αποθείωσης, επιτρέπει την παραγωγή «πράσινου ντίζελ».

Στον ναυτιλιακό τομέα, η Helleniq Energy έχει ξεκινήσει την παραγωγή μείγματος ναυτιλιακού καυσίμου (mazut) με βιοντίζελ, χρησιμοποιώντας αποκλειστικά απορρίμματα ελαίων. Η χρήση βιοκαυσίμων στη ναυτιλία εντάσσεται στο πλαίσιο του FuelEU Maritime, με τις εταιρίες να αναζητούν τρόπους συμμόρφωσης ενόψει της ενσωμάτωσης του τομέα στο Σύστημα Εμπορίας Εκπομπών.

Παραγωγή βιοκαυσίμων

Σε ανάλογο μήκος κύματος η Motor Oil προωθεί τη δημιουργία εγκαταστάσεων προηγμένων βιοκαυσίμων, με στόχο την παραγωγή άνω των 250.000 τόνων ετησίως. Επιπλέον, βρίσκονται στα σκαριά επενδύσεις για την ανάπτυξη e-μεθανόλης, με προγραμματισμένη παραγωγή 25.000 τόνων έως το 2029.

Το 2022 ο όμιλος εξαγόρασε την Elin Verde με αντικείμενο την παραγωγή και εμπορία βιοκαυσίμων, η οποία διαθέτει εργοστάσιο παραγωγής βιοντίζελ στη ΒΙ.ΠΕ Βόλου, ενώ ελέγχει και την «Πράσινο Λάδι» που δραστηριοποιείται στη συλλογή και εμπορία χρησιμοποιημένων μαγειρικών ελαίων και ζωικών λιπών (που αποτελούν την πρώτη ύλη για τα βιοκαύσιμα).

Το κόστος των συγκεκριμένων καυσίμων αλλά και κυρίως η ανεπάρκεια πρώτων υλών είναι από τα κυριότερα προβλήματα στην παραγωγή και τη χρήση τους. Αξίζει αναφερθεί ότι το κόστος του SAF αρχικά ήταν πενταπλάσιο από το απλό καύσιμο αεροπορίας και σήμερα είναι διπλάσιο. Βεβαίως το χαμηλό ποσοστό πρόσμιξης μειώνει δραστικά την επίπτωση στην τελική τιμή του προϊόντος.

Persidangan Kemuncak ASEAN 2025 yang bakal berlangsung pada 26 dan 27 Mei 2025 di Pusat Konvensyen Kuala Lumpur (KLCC) menjadi titik tolak penting dalam sejarah rantau ini. Dengan Malaysia sebagai Pengerusi ASEAN, perhimpunan ini membawa satu naratif besar melalui temanya – “Keterangkuman dan Kemampanan”. Tema ini bukan sahaja mencerminkan aspirasi serantau, malah selari dengan prinsip Malaysia MADANI yang diterajui oleh YAB Perdana Menteri, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.

Peranan Sejarah Malaysia dalam ASEAN

Malaysia merupakan negara pengasas ASEAN sejak tahun 1967. Sepanjang dekad-dekad yang lalu, negara ini telah memainkan peranan penting dalam mempromosikan kerjasama serantau, keamanan dan pembangunan ekonomi. Sebagai Pengerusi ASEAN buat kali kelima, Malaysia membawa pendekatan progresif yang menggabungkan elemen kemanusiaan dan keterangkuman sosial. Hal ini merupakan satu pendekatan yang amat diperlukan dalam dunia pasca-pandemik dan perubahan iklim yang drastik.

Makna Tema “Keterangkuman dan Kemampanan”

Tema ini menggabungkan dua nilai teras:

 Keterangkuman (Inclusivity) menekankan kepada penyertaan menyeluruh semua golongan masyarakat tanpa mengira latar belakang – termasuk wanita, golongan orang kurang upaya (OKU), belia, warga emas, dan masyarakat luar bandar. Keterangkuman ini juga mencakupi penglibatan negara-negara anggota ASEAN dalam membuat keputusan kolektif tanpa dominasi oleh negara tertentu.

 Kemampanan (Sustainability) pula merujuk kepada pembangunan yang menjaga keseimbangan antara keperluan ekonomi, kelestarian alam sekitar, dan kesejahteraan sosial. Dalam erti kata lain, kemajuan mesti diwarisi oleh generasi masa depan tanpa menjejaskan sumber sedia ada.

Langkah-Langkah Malaysia sebagai Pengerusi ASEAN 2025

1. Pengukuhan Ekonomi Digital dan Rantaian Bekalan Inklusif

Malaysia memimpin inisiatif Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA), satu rangka kerja pertama di ASEAN bagi menyelaraskan ekosistem digital antara negara anggota. Ini bukan sahaja membuka peluang pekerjaan dan pelaburan, malah memberi akses kepada masyarakat luar bandar dan golongan mikro-PKI untuk terlibat dalam ekonomi digital.

Selain itu, pihak kerajaan turut menekankan ekonomi gig dan pembelajaran sepanjang hayat bagi memastikan semua golongan, termasuk belia dan OKU, tidak tertinggal dalam perubahan ini.

2. Agenda Alam Sekitar dan Tenaga Lestari

Malaysia telah mengemukakan beberapa inisiatif termasuk pengeluaran Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), pelabuhan hijau, dan grid tenaga karbon rendah merentas ASEAN. Usaha ini diselaraskan dengan Pelan Peralihan Tenaga Nasional dan aspirasi Net-Zero 2050. ASEAN turut menyokong pembangunan ekopelancongan dan pertanian lestari sebagai sumber pertumbuhan hijau baharu.

Selain itu, Malaysia juga akan mengadvokasi kerjasama serantau yang lebih erat dalam tindakan iklim, tenaga hijau dan pembangunan mampa. Lebih memberansangkan, Malaysia kini merupakan hab utama global bagi pengeluaran komponen solar fotovoltaik (PV), dengan enam daripada sepuluh syarikat pengeluar PV terbesar dunia beroperasi di negara ini.

Hal ini melambangkan menifestasi Malaysia yang komited sepenuhnya terhadap peralihan hijau, bukan sahaja dalam negara malah merentasi Asia Tenggara. Kita terus memperjuangkan dasar, teknologi dan amalan lestari yang memberi manfaat kepada ASEAN secara keseluruhannya.

3. Pengarusutamaan Golongan Rentan dan OKU dalam Dasar Serantau

Satu aspek penting yang ditekankan Malaysia ialah penglibatan aktif golongan OKU dalam pembangunan. Melalui pelaksanaan Rangka Tindakan ASEAN mengenai Keterangkuman Sosial (ASEAN Enabling Masterplan 2025), Malaysia mengambil langkah untuk menyediakan infrastruktur mesra OKU, peluang pekerjaan, serta sokongan kesihatan mental dan fizikal.

Antara program yang dilaksanakan termasuk sokongan sosial berbentuk latihan digital, insentif majikan mesra OKU, dan kempen kesedaran di institusi awam dan pendidikan.

4. Pendidikan Inklusif dan Penglibatan Belia

Malaysia menekankan kepada keterlibatan belia sebagai agen perubahan. Pendidikan rentas sempadan, biasiswa ASEAN, dan program pertukaran budaya dijadikan platform memupuk semangat serantau dan toleransi. Dalam masa sama, pendekatan STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) turut digalakkan bagi melahirkan tenaga kerja berkemahiran tinggi yang inklusif gender dan etnik.

5. Pengukuhan Tadbir Urus Serantau dan Rangka Dasar MADANI

Kepimpinan Malaysia dalam ASEAN 2025 juga menjadi pentas untuk mempromosikan nilai-nilai MADANI dalam konteks antarabangsa. Ini termasuklah:

 Kemampanan melalui dasar peralihan tenaga dan ekonomi hijau

 Kesejahteraan melalui agenda sosial yang menyeluruh

 Keterangkuman dalam pembentukan dasar awam dan diplomasi rakyat

Aspirasi MADANI ini diterapkan dalam sidang kemuncak melalui pelibatan pelbagai sektor – awam, swasta dan masyarakat sivil – dalam proses perundingan dan pelaksanaan dasar.

Kajian Perbandingan dan Sokongan Serantau

Negara jiran seperti Thailand dan Indonesia menyambut baik pendekatan Malaysia. Thailand misalnya, menyatakan sokongan terbuka terhadap visi keterangkuman Malaysia, khususnya dalam pelibatan masyarakat tempatan dan penjagaan biodiversiti serantau. Indonesia pula melihat Malaysia sebagai rakan kongsi penting dalam menstrukturkan ekosistem digital dan pemerkasaan komuniti melalui inisiatif ekonomi hijau.

Cabaran dan Syor Penambahbaikan

1. Jurang Digital antara Kawasan Bandar dan Luar Bandar Cabaran:

Melalui laporan Biro Perdagangan Antarabangsa Amerika mengenai Malaysia pada tahun 2024 menyatakan, walaupun kadar penembusan internet di kawasan bandar Malaysia mencapai 92%, kawasan luar bandar masih ketinggalan dengan hanya 68% akses internet. Jurang ini menghalang penyertaan penuh komuniti luar bandar dalam ekonomi digital, pendidikan dalam talian, dan perkhidmatan kerajaan elektronik.

Syor:

 Pelaksanaan Audit Inklusiviti Digital: Menilai dan mengenal pasti kawasan yang memerlukan peningkatan infrastruktur digital.

 Peningkatan Peruntukan untuk Pendidikan Keterangkuman Digital: Menyediakan latihan dan sumber kepada komuniti luar bandar untuk meningkatkan literasi digital.

 Kerjasama Awam-Swasta: Mendorong pelaburan dalam infrastruktur digital di kawasan kurang liputan melalui insentif dan kerjasama strategik.

2. Kesedaran tentang Kelestarian Alam Sekitar dalam Kalangan Industri Kecil dan Sederhana (PKS)

Cabaran:

The Malaysiaan Reserve melaporkan walaupun kesedaran ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) dalam kalangan PKS Malaysia meningkat dari 14% kepada 80% dalam dua tahun terakhir, banyak PKS masih menghadapi cabaran dalam melaksanakan amalan lestari sepenuhnya.

Syor:

 Penyediaan Panduan ESG yang Mudah Difahami: Memperkenalkan panduan ESG yang disesuaikan dengan keperluan PKS untuk memudahkan pelaksanaan.

 Insentif Kewangan dan Sokongan Teknikal: Menyediakan geran, pinjaman mudah, dan bantuan teknikal kepada PKS yang berusaha mengamalkan kelestarian.

 Program Latihan dan Kesedaran: Mengadakan bengkel dan seminar untuk meningkatkan pemahaman PKS mengenai kepentingan dan manfaat amalan lestari.

3. Penglibatan Orang Kurang Upaya (OKU) yang Masih Bersifat Simbolik

Cabaran:

Walaupun terdapat dasar seperti ASEAN Enabling Masterplan 2025, penglibatan OKU dalam pembangunan sosial dan ekonomi masih terhad dan sering bersifat simbolik dan terdapat syor supaya keteribatan OKU mesti dipertingkatkan dengan beberapa syor berikut.

Syor:

 Memperluas Akses Kesihatan dan Infrastruktur Mesra OKU: Meningkatkan kemudahan awam dan perkhidmatan kesihatan yang mesra OKU di seluruh negara.

 Pelaksanaan Audit Inklusiviti dalam Semua Dasar ASEAN: Menilai sejauh mana dasar-dasar sedia ada memenuhi keperluan OKU dan membuat penambahbaikan

yang diperlukan.

 Memperkenalkan Indeks ASEAN-MADANI: Membangunkan penanda aras untuk menilai kemajuan keterangkuman dan kemampanan, termasuk penglibatan OKU, di peringkat serantau.

Dengan mengatasi cabaran-cabaran ini melalui syor-syor yang dicadangkan, Malaysia dapat memimpin ASEAN ke arah masa depan yang lebih inklusif dan lestari, selaras dengan aspirasi tema &quot;Keterangkuman dan Kemampanan&quot; serta prinsip Malaysia MADANI.

Penjajaran dengan Aspirasi Malaysia MADANI

Aspirasi Malaysia MADANI yang menekankan nilai-nilai kemampanan, kesejahteraan, dan keterangkuman sosial sejajar dengan tema ASEAN 2025. Melalui kepimpinan dalam ASEAN, Malaysia berpeluang untuk mempromosikan nilai-nilai ini di peringkat serantau, memperkukuh perpaduan dan kemakmuran bersama.

Kesimpulan: Harapan dan Aspirasi Rakyat Malaysia

Persidangan Kemuncak ASEAN 2025 merupakan medan penting bagi Malaysia memperlihatkan kepemimpinan berwibawa yang bukan sahaja berpaksikan ekonomi dan geopolitik, malah nilai-nilai kemanusiaan dan rahmah. Dengan menekankan aspek keterangkuman dan kemampanan, Malaysia boleh menjadi contoh kepada dunia bahawa pembangunan yang bersifat menyeluruh dan lestari mampu menjadi realiti.

Sebagai Pengerusi ASEAN 2025, Malaysia memainkan peranan penting dalam memacu pembangunan serantau yang inklusif dan lestari. Melalui pelbagai inisiatif dalam bidang Ekonomi digital, kemampanan alam sekitar, keterangkuman sosial, dan infrastruktur, Malaysia berusaha untuk memastikan bahawa tiada siapa yang ketinggalan dalam arus pembangunan. Penjajaran dengan aspirasi Malaysia MADANI memperkukuh lagi komitmen negara untuk membina masyarakat yang adil, makmur, dan berdaya tahan di peringkat serantau.

Rakyat Malaysia, khususnya golongan muda dan OKU, mengharapkan bahawa inisiatif ini tidak hanya tinggal sebagai slogan atau dokumen dasar, tetapi diterjemahkan ke dalam tindakan konkrit dan berkesan.

Kedua langkah tersebut menjadi kunci bagi perusahaan dalam menghadapi situasi geopolitik yang sangat dinamis dalam beberapa waktu terakhir.

Sejumlah kondisi geopolitik masih menjadi sorotan bagi aktivitas perdagangan global. Kebijakan tarif, perang antara Rusia dan Ukraina, ketegangan India dan Pakistan, hingga konflik kawasan di sejumlah negara di Timur Tengah yang tak kunjung mereda, adalah contoh dinamika yang berdampak cukup besar saat ini.

Sebagai antisipasi menghadapi kondisi itu, PIS terus memperkuat lini bisnis dengan strategi terukur. PIS akan mengungkap racikan perusahaan itu secara menyeluruh di ajang Indonesia Maritime Week (IMW) 2025 yang akan digelar pada 26–28 Mei 2025 di Jakarta.

Direktur Perencanaan Bisnis PIS Eka Suhendra menyampaikan, “Ekspansi pasar dan diversifikasi kargo masih menjadi landasan strategi PIS dalam menghadapi dinamika geopolitik yang begitu fluktuatif. Langkah ini kami ambil untuk mencegah ketergantungan perusahaan terhadap suatu pasar dan produk kargo tertentu.”

PIS terus memperluas rute pelayaran di domestik dan luar negeri. Hingga hari ini, rute pelayaran internasional PIS sudah mencapai 65 negara. Selain itu, PIS juga telah memiliki tiga kantor perwakilan di Singapura, Dubai, dan London. Dengan terus memperluas pasar dan layanan, PIS sebagai subholding dan bagian dari Pertamina Group, menegaskan posisinya sebagai pemain global di sektor logistik energi dan maritim.

“Keberhasilan langkah ini terbukti meningkatkan kontribusi pendapatan dari pasar non-captive hingga 64% sepanjang tahun 2024 dibandingkan tahun sebelumnya,” imbuh Eka.

Dalam setiap langkah strategisnya, PIS tidak hanya berorientasi pada pertumbuhan bisnis, tetapi juga pada kontribusi nyata bagi bangsa. Sebagai bagian dari BUMN logistik dan energi, PIS menjalankan peran penting dalam menjaga ketahanan energi nasional melalui rantai logistik laut yang andal dan berkelanjutan.

Dengan memperluas jangkauan dan diversifikasi layanan, PIS turut memperkuat posisi Indonesia sebagai poros maritim dunia serta mendukung terciptanya konektivitas laut yang efisien dan kompetitif, baik untuk kepentingan nasional maupun regional.

Di samping perluasan pasar, PIS juga terus menggencarkan diversifikasi produk. Meskipun tetap fokus terhadap bisnis inti dalam pengangkutan energi, PIS senantiasa menatap sektor lain yang memiliki potensi besar untuk digarap seperti halnya dry bulk.

“PIS aktif mengkaji berbagai produk di luar sektor energi sebagai diversifikasi produk angkutan kami.

A relatively new plant to Australia called Carinata is changing the biofuels industry, and trials are happening now west of the Great Dividing Range.

Cotton growers have been giving it a go as a rotation crop.

The results are pretty golden so far.

Carinata oil, when refined, is considered a ‘drop-in’ replacement for existing fossil fuels: the biofuel can be used without updating or retrofitting current machines, and blends with existing fossil fuels.

Biofuels: replacement fossil fuels, usually bioethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels, made out of sustainable biogenic resources. Everything from wood offcuts, to agricultural by-products, used cooking oil or beef tallow and even algae can be turned into biofuels.

Queensland Government’s definition of Biofuels

Cream of the Crop

Carinata looks similar to canola; bright yellow flowers on towering green stems.

It’s grown in winter and suits drier soil types.

It boasts lower water needs than Canola, due to a longer rootstock.

The crop is being pitched as an emerging option for broadacre farmers over winter.

Having a ‘cover crop’ is being adopted by many growers looking to reduce topsoil losses, in between their traditional cropping seasons.

The oil from the Brassica family plant is classed as non-food: unlike Canola, it can’t be consumed by humans.

Harvest and crushing

Currently, once matured and harvested, Carinata is shipped to Europe for processing. There are no operational processing facilities in Australia yet.

The grain is processed into two products: biofuel, and high protein plant feed for stock.

Biofuel use has already been written into EU’s aviation fuel regulations, and Asia has indicated it will follow.

In Australia, Qantas has committed to using 10% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in its overall fuel mix by 2030.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Produced from sustainable feedstocks and is very similar in its chemistry to traditional fossil jet fuel.

BP’s definition of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The aviation industry has shown serious interest in Carinata-derived biofuel.

Plant Power

The plant’s pre-commercial trials in Australia are being overseen by Nufarm.

Rachel Palumbo is Nufarm’s Global General Manager for seeds, and is hopeful Australia could become a world-leader.

“Australia has the land, resources, and expertise to lead in renewable fuels, sustainable agriculture, and homegrown manufacturing,” she said.

“In South America, farmers already produce low-carbon fuel at scale. With the right support Australian growers can do the same.

Growers benefit from having a profitable break crop that improves soil health

Government support needed

Earlier this year, the Australian Government announced it would invest $250 million into low-carbon liquid fuels.

“This funding will drive innovation and open new opportunities for farmers to supply feedstocks like Carinata,” Ms Palumbo said.

The Queensland Government has also shown interest in the blooming industry, recently commissioning Deloitte to review global SAF markets.

The 2024 report found:

“Australia’s SAF industry is still in its infancy and this is unlikely to change on the scale needed to support decarbonisation without government intervention and a proactive industry.”

Ms Palumbo also pointed to government-driven SAF mandates as a crucial step to fostering a local biofuels industry.

“We need a clear policy framework so Australian-grown biofuels can support local industries, just as Australian-grown canola already does for European biofuels.”

“This is a proven, sustainable, and scalable option for securing our fuel future while supporting growers and cutting emissions,” Ms Palumbo said.",https://farmers.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Carinata-feilds-photo-credit-Nuseed.png,N,,2025-05-26 01:56:13.164558

So, what do we know about the changes in the global footprint of companies and government policies towards foreign business and trade?
Business executives would do well to recall Deming’s dictum: stakeholders that claim that the polycrisis changes everything should be asked to provide hard evidence.
For international business nowadays those risks are just as likely to arise at home than from abroad.
But what executives must not do is allow narrative alone to induce a retreat from foreign markets.","One example is a recent speech by Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s deputy prime minister, finance minister and former foreign minister, in which she re-examines the results of spending “three decades building an interconnected global economy” .

The view that flows from some of this thinking is that the international footprint of companies must be rethought because executives failed to take proper account of risks evident in today’s fraught world.

And the drum beat from certain key policymakers is relentless. Apparent “weaponization” of trade ties by China and Russia has put wind in their sails, as Mark Leonard shows in his 2021 book The Age of Unpeace. This has led to calls for supply chains to be designed with “just in case” considerations in mind rather than with “just in time”.

Senior national security officials from Germany, the US, and the UK are on record twisting the knife further – adding an “us versus them” angle to corporate deliberations on supply chain reconfiguration. In a speech in London in July, 2022, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Christopher Wray, said that China posed a “far more complex and pervasive threat to businesses than even most sophisticated company leaders realize” .

Other policymakers are not content with leaving it to international business to adjust (or not) as they see fit; they have begun to take action. US Commerce and Treasury Secretaries now advocate a “friend-shoring” approach to recasting international supply chains. This has been backed up by controversial tax incentives in the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act in the US.

For their part, the European Commission has adopted a policy of “Open Strategic Autonomy,” an approach that puts more emphasis on the last word rather than the first two. One of the first policymakers to call for action was late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose government set up in April 2020 a $2 billion fund to encourage Japanese firms to shift factories out of China..

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine added fuel to the fire to those claiming that globalization has gone too far. Western businesses operating in Russia were urged to divest, lest they be accused of “trading with the enemy”. Yet the reality has been more complicated. Straight divestment has consequences. The chairman of one large pharmaceutical company told me that they should not leave Russia and punish their customers, the logic being: why should a sick Russian be denied Western medicines because of Putin’s war?

From the start, forward-looking analysts and executives saw Western government sanctions on Russia and the concomitant pressure exerted on business as a dress rehearsal for the disruption to corporate plans that would follow a future Chinese attempt to forcibly reunite with Taiwan.

The question is whether this drum beat of criticism is actually prompting widespread retreat from globalization in terms of corporate decisions and of government policy capable of shaping those decisions. At this point, there are good reasons for doubting that broad-based retreat is occurring or, perhaps more importantly, on the cards.

Adding to the rhetoric is the awkward fact that most trusted sources of information on business and policy developments publish facts long after key decisions were taken. It was notable that during the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments did not have up-to-date information on the where to source medical equipment.

When it comes to the data waymarkers of globalization, the US Department of Commerce publishes quite detailed statistics on the global footprint of American multinationals with a three-year lag. Global cross-border data on goods shipments is obtainable from the United Nations, for example, but comes with a minimum 12-month lag.

Moreover, only twice a year does the World Trade Organization publish reports on the policy steps taken by governments – and much of the policy relevant to business isn’t covered in those WTO reports. No international organization has a mandate to collect detailed information on policies affecting service sectors or the digital economy. In these circumstances, when credible information is either non-existent or delivered very late – and to paraphrase the oft-used maxim – a narrative can get halfway around the world before the truth can get its shoes on.

So, what do we know about the changes in the global footprint of companies and government policies towards foreign business and trade? The best advice here is to pierce the veil of rhetoric and demand hard facts on what is changing on the ground. As renowned US engineer and statistician W. Edwards Deming once said: “In God we trust. All others must bring data.”

Yes, foreign direct investment – a prominent manifestation of globalization – is growing more slowly than domestic capital expenditures. But this has been the tendency since 2005, well before the Global Financial Crisis, the US-China trade war, and the current polycrisis.

Beyond the tariffs imposed during the US-China trade war (where total trade affected amounts to less than 5% of world goods trade) and this year’s Western sanctions on Russia, calculations based on the Global Trade Alert database reveal that just 5.6% of world goods trade is affected by protectionist measures that single out another nation’s exports.

When it comes to government policies towards foreign business and trade, awarding corporate subsidies is the most common form of government favoritism around the world (not just in China). Some of that largesse is designed to shore up competitive positions in home markets, some in foreign markets. But few state incentives exist to repatriate factories from abroad.

When governments put money on the table to reconfigure supply chains, compared to the corporate stakes involved, the sums are trivial. Japan’s scheme mentioned earlier garnered a lot of headlines because of its budget envelope – but it turned out that, on average, Japanese firms that benefited received less than $15 million each. The recent CHIPS and Science Act in the US includes tens of billions of dollars of incentives to set up semiconductor fabs in the country, yet industry analysts are unanimous in saying that these sums are a fraction of the costs borne by business.

At least four studies of sourcing patterns of those medical goods scarce at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic – including a peer-reviewed examination of the issue by me in 2020, and another by European Centre for International Political Economy senior economist Oscar Guinea the same year – revealed very few cases where most supplies came from China. Little remarked upon was the fact that mask shortages and the like quickly subsided once Chinese factories geared up production in mid-2020.

While some Western politicians and foreign policy analysts reckon that the world is on its way to a definitive split between rival democratic and autocratic blocks, the reality is that democratic nations crimp the exports of other democratic nations proportionally more than they do from autocracies. Yet, the reluctance of US and EU officials to contemplate new binding trade deals shuts off one-way democratic nations could form a block that could create meaningful gains for international business.

Many companies said after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that they were exiting or planned to. Some large multinationals did, but a surprising number remain, and some of those that fully divested have even negotiated clauses to buy their assets back later.

What to make of this? Globalization and cross-border supply chains have been traduced. To the extent that trade and investment flows have been weaponized, this is localized and doesn’t merit a systemic rethink. Business executives would do well to recall Deming’s dictum: stakeholders that claim that the polycrisis changes everything should be asked to provide hard evidence. Officials have yet to follow through on their advocacy of decoupling, so there is a mismatch between rhetoric and actions taken. Furthermore, business isn’t retreating wholesale from emerging markets.

FBI Director Wray was right to encourage accurate risk assessments in his speech. But this applies to policy risks as well as to the loss of intellectual property in China. For international business nowadays those risks are just as likely to arise at home than from abroad. Risk assessment should be based on best available evidence. Executives should first identify which emergent geopolitical risks pose the greatest threat to their existing business models (not all do) and then seek out the experts prepared to piece together disparate information and insights on relevant policy dynamics.

From time-to-time, executives and board members should schedule discussions on how they would react to different contingencies and whether to adjust their global footprint to “known unknows” as the late Donald Rumsfeld would have put it.

Globalization will continue to evolve. But what executives must not do is allow narrative alone to induce a retreat from foreign markets.",https://www.imd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alexandr-podvalny-FvBVVf0ctnk-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 22:56:41.376558

Kim Reynolds' desk. A number of those pieces of legislation directly impact agriculture.

Biofuels

In early May, Reynolds increased funding for the Iowa Renewable Fuel Infrastructure Program. In July, the annual support will rise from $10 million to $14 million. The Iowa Soybean Association said the funds will be used to help gas stations and other fueling sites update their equipment to use renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel.

“Increasing demand and accessibility for biodiesel is a top priority for Iowa farmers,” Suzanne Shirbroun, ISA president and farmer from Farmersburg, said in a press release. “A strong biodiesel market helps support our state’s thriving agriculture industry by increasing the per-bushel price of soybeans.”

Iowa is the top producer of both ethanol and biodiesel. The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association says those fuels account for $5.7 billion of the state's GDP.

Property Taxes

Iowa Corn Growers Association Vice President of Government Relations Kevin Studer said farmers will not see property tax relief this year from the state legislature. He said it's an institutional part of the state's government, but also a place the organization's members would like to see reform.

""It's not a very sexy issue, but it's one that's very vital to our members,"" Studer said. ""It's kind of like, yes, if you have $7 corn, that's awesome, but if you get property taxes and all your input costs and everything keep creeping away at your at your balance sheet, that's always a negative from our standpoint.""

CO2 Pipelines

HF 639, a bill that places more requirements on carbon dioxide pipeline projects, was passed by the state legislature. On Thursday, ethanol industry members and a number of farmers held a press call asking the governor to veto the legislation.

Mike Jerke is the CEO of Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, an ethanol plant in southwest Iowa. He says all the landowners involved with their CO2 project have agreed voluntarily. He said the permit limit is a deal-breaker.

""The existing language in statute said the maximum was 25 years, but then the death blow is you cannot renew a permit if you're transporting liquefied carbon dioxide. You cannot renew it,"" Jerke said.

Der Industriekonzern treibt gezielte Portfolioanpassungen voran – mit einem klaren Fokus auf nachhaltige Technologien und profitables Wachstum. Doch was steckt hinter den jüngsten Transaktionen, und wie positioniert sich das Unternehmen für die Zukunft?

Ausstieg aus dem Schutzausrüstungsgeschäft

In einem strategischen Schritt hat Honeywell sein Geschäft mit persönlicher Schutzausrüstung (PPE) für 1,325 Milliarden Dollar in bar an Protective Industrial Products verkauft. Diese Entscheidung markiert den vollständigen Rückzug aus dem PPE-Markt und soll das Portfolio des Unternehmens optimieren. Ziel ist es, sich stärker auf Kernbereiche mit höherem Wachstumspotenzial und besserer Cash-Generierung zu konzentrieren.

Milliarden-Deal für nachhaltige Technologien

Parallel zum Verkauf kündigte Honeywell die Übernahme des Katalysatortechnik-Geschäfts von Johnson Matthey für rund 2,42 Milliarden Dollar an. Diese Akquisition soll das Energiesparte des Konzerns entscheidend stärken, insbesondere die UOP-Sparte, die auf Katalysatoren und Prozesstechnologien spezialisiert ist.

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Honeywell?

Die Integration des neuen Geschäftsbereichs wird Honeywells Präsenz in den Bereichen Raffinerie und Petrochemie deutlich ausbauen. Besonders im Fokus stehen dabei Technologien für:

Nachhaltige Kraftstoffe wie SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel)

Blaue Wasserstoff- und Ammoniakproduktion

CO2-arme Methanolherstellung

Die Transaktion, die voraussichtlich bis zur ersten Hälfte 2026 abgeschlossen sein soll, wird bereits im ersten vollen Geschäftsjahr einen positiven Beitrag zum Ergebnis leisten.

Klare strategische Ausrichtung

Diese jüngsten Maßnahmen zeigen Honeywells Entschlossenheit, sein Portfolio aktiv an zukunftsträchtige Wachstumsfelder anzupassen.

Low-carbon liquid fuels are often described as ""drop in"" solutions, as they can work with existing petrol tankers, fuel bowsers and internal combustion engines.
A compromise can be found by blending synthetic fuel with the fossil equivalent, lowering emissions and making it more affordable.
The transition from fossil to low-carbon liquid fuels is already underway in some of these sectors.
The nation's science agency believes making low-carbon liquid fuels domestically would help shore up the country's energy security.","When Formula 1 cars nudge speeds of 330 kilometres per hour next year, hundreds of millions of people will witness existing engines and infrastructure working with a fuel once considered futuristic.

The fuel burning inside the turbocharged V6 engines won't be gutted from the Earth like traditional fossil fuels; instead, most will be chemically synthesised and involve the recycling of existing carbon dioxide — making it close to carbon neutral.

""It would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent,"" Liam Parker said, chief communications officer at Formula 1.

""The technical analysis shows zero drop in performance, so you're racing green, you're providing a solution for the automotive sector and the wider consumer, but you're also giving the public and the fans what they want.""

Five different companies — many of them sponsors — will be supplying the 100 per cent synthetic and biofuel to the 11 teams on the grid, once again positioning Formula 1 as the breeding ground of the kind of innovation that trickles to road cars and other vehicles.

Industry stakeholders believe these low-carbon liquid fuels provide a window of opportunity for Australia, claiming it can help connect the vehicles, ships and planes of today to a net-zero tomorrow, and create a multi-billion-dollar domestic manufacturing industry that would also bolster the nation's fuel security.

""We estimate the Australian low-carbon liquid fuel market could be in the order of $36 billion a year by 2050, and a feedstock market of about $15 billion,"" said Rupert Maloney, executive director of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), a Commonwealth-funded investment firm backing green initiatives.

What makes synthetic and biofuel different?

There are two main types of low-carbon liquid fuels: synthetic and biofuel.

Both of them source carbon from the atmosphere when they're being developed, effectively recycling it once it is burned by an engine.

But whereas biofuel is processed from organic material such as sugarcane, used cooking oil and sawmill residue, the latest synthetic fuel doesn't affect food production.

It chemically synthesises the elements that make fuel: hydrogen and carbon.

The hydrogen is split from water in a process powered by renewable electricity, while the carbon is either captured from the air using emerging technology, extracted from algae, or gleaned from sustainable sources like waste.

The domestic biofuel industry is already growing as local feedstock is exported internationally, but industry stakeholders believe synthetic fuel has greater scale-up potential.

Global companies want to make synthetic fuel in Australia

At least two companies are looking at manufacturing synthetic fuel in Australia — HIF (Highly Innovative Fuels) and Zero Petroleum — with each expected to start construction on plants in 2026.

HIF is aiming to produce 100 million litres of synthetic fuel a year once its manufacturing plant is up and running in 2030 — about 500 times more than its concept plant in Chile.

The company, which counts Porsche among its investors, claims it is spending about $2 billion constructing the plant in Tasmania.

""What we look for are locations where the feed stocks that we need to make this product are available and are also cost efficient,"" said Ignacio Hernandez, chief executive of HIF Asia Pacific.

""One of the main ingredients that we need is renewable energy, and Australia is well known globally for having a big renewable energy potential.""

Meanwhile, Zero Petroleum — founded by former F1 engineer Paddy Lowe and chemical engineer Nilay Shah — is examining the feasibility of building a plant in South Australia.

The facility would produce up to 10 million litres of synthetic aviation fuel, gasoline and diesel a year.

It works with our cars today, but will we use it?

Low-carbon liquid fuels are often described as ""drop in"" solutions, as they can work with existing petrol tankers, fuel bowsers and internal combustion engines.

But there's disagreement on whether the fuel would be used in the nearly 16 million passenger vehicles registered in Australia.

How much it costs at the bowser will be a key determinant.

A compromise can be found by blending synthetic fuel with the fossil equivalent, lowering emissions and making it more affordable.

""The cost of the product will come down, and eventually you're able to transition to 100 per cent synthetic, without impacting materially the cost to the final consumer,"" Mr Hernandez said.

A key factor in the price coming down is the cost of renewable electricity, as wind and solar farms would power the manufacturing process to keep the carbon footprint as low as possible.

""We need very low renewable energy costs in order to get that hydrogen price down,"" Max Temminghoff said, Mineral Resources Lead at the CSIRO Futures.

""And then on the other flip side is the carbon dioxide. Pulling that out of the atmosphere currently is technologically not as mature and is a bit expensive, so that's what the CSIRO is working on.""

Betting on electric vehicles and new infrastructure

Instead, there is a concerted effort to transition cars and the infrastructure powering them to electric — but there's a long way to go to meet the CSIRO's target of 97 per cent by 2050.

The latest data from the federal government, dated January 2024, reveals there are 15.7 million passenger vehicles registered in Australia.

One per cent — or 159,460 — were electric.

Vehicles powered by petrol or diesel made up 95.5 per cent — or 14,958,462 vehicles.

""There will be an existing fleet of internal combustion engines, we think, still operating at that point [in 2050], and there needs to be a solution for those cars,"" HIF's Mr Hernandez said.

Sustainable fuel could be used in vehicles that are hard to electrify

The demand, policy and money opportunities suggest synthetic fuel will be used to power trucks driving interstate, ships travelling across oceans and planes flying internationally.

""By 2050, about 30 billion litres in Australia will likely be hard to electrify and will likely require low carbon liquid fuels or other decarbonisation technologies,"" the CEFC's Mr Maloney said.

The transition from fossil to low-carbon liquid fuels is already underway in some of these sectors.

Qantas imported 1.7 million litres of sustainable fuel in early May, hoping to blend it at a ratio of 18 per cent with traditional jet fuel.

The airline claims it could power the equivalent of 900 flights from Sydney to Auckland, reducing carbon emissions by 3,400 tonnes.

But it had to shop overseas, importing the biofuel from Malaysia.

""The creation of a domestic sustainable aviation fuel industry is key to our efforts towards the decarbonisation of aviation,"" said Vanessa Hudson, the chief executive of Qantas Group.

Manufactures say updated policy will drive investment

The federal government is hoping to foster a low-carbon liquid fuel manufacturing industry in Australia, announcing $250 million in grants in March.

""Australia has the know-how and skills to meet the crucial task of decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation, heavy transport and mining that rely on liquid fuels,"" Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said.

But the industry is asking for the kind of regulations popping up in other parts of the world, including mandates that would require select sectors to blend a percentage of synthetic fuel with their current fossil stock.

""Some of the mandates that are getting rolled out across Asia are in the order of 1 per cent blend, so it will not have a large impact on end use pricing,"" Mr Maloney said.

""It provides an investment signal back to the production side of the market to develop these facilities, and that brings down the cost.""

HIF's facility could produce enough synthetic fuel to meet a quarter of Tasmania's demand, Mr Hernandez said, but instead it'll likely export supply to other countries.

""There are other markets in the world that have more advanced regulation to support the uptake of these products,"" he said.

Australia relies on liquid fuels for more than half of its energy demand, according to federal government data, but the number of local refineries has dwindled from seven to two.

The nation's science agency believes making low-carbon liquid fuels domestically would help shore up the country's energy security.

High costs have discouraged potential offtakers, dampening interest in the idea of extracting hydrogen from renewable resources instead of simply squeezing it from natural gas or coal. However, China did not get the memo…

China’s Excellent Green Hydrogen Adventure

Three weeks ago, S&P Global took note of a new hydrogen report posted by China’s National Energy Administration. Although China continues to produce a prodigious amount of hydrogen from from fossil resources, the nation’s green hydrogen footprint is growing into a market force to be reckoned with.

“China now accounts for 50% of global green hydrogen production capacity,” S&P summarized. The strong showing suggests that competition from Chinese producers is one reason why diversified energy stakeholders in the US and elsewhere have rolled back their plans for renewable H2, to concentrate on their traditional business.

Further wracking nerves among green H2 producers in other regions is China’s pursuit of patents. Earlier this month the Asia-Pacific news organization Recessary was among those taking note of an analysis by the Japanese firm Astamuse, indicating that China has been scrambling to file renewable hydrogen patents at a furious pace since 2020, when the nation announced its carbon targets.

“The large number of patents has driven down the cost of hydrogen production equipment in China to just a quarter of that in Europe,” Recessary noted, referring to electrolyzer systems powered by renewable energy, which deploy electricity and a catalyst to push hydrogen gas from water (see more green H2 background here).

Scaling Up Green Hydrogen For Green Ammonia

Rounding out the news from China, last week the firm Envision Energy announced that the global testing and inspection firm Bureau Veritas has certified its forthcoming 500-megawatt Chifeng facility in Inner Mongolai for industrial-scale renewable ammonia, to be produced with green hydrogen. The facility began limited production last year and is on track to reach full volume this September.

Although much attention has been paid to the role of green hydrogen as a fuel for fuel cell vehicles of various sorts, hydrogen is also an industrial input with a firm grip on the ammonia fertilizer field, and that is where another opportunity lies. Last week Envision reached an agreement with the leading Japanese infrastructure and commodities trading firm Marubeni, indicating that the demand for green ammonia can support industrial scale electrolyzer systems.

“The project uses Envision’s advanced electrolyzer technology, powered by wind and solar, to produce 300,000 tons of green ammonia annually, making it one of the world’s first and largest commercial projects of its kind,” Envision explained.

“It is a testament to how innovation and sustainability can go hand-in-hand – from our advanced electrolyzer technology to the use of 100% renewable power, we’re redefining what’s possible in green hydrogen and ammonia production,” emphasized Envision VP Frank Yu in a press statement.

Meanwhile, Over Here In The USA …

The US is one of those other regions where green hydrogen producers are getting a case of the yips, though not particularly on account of forthcoming competition from China. Instead, the call is coming from inside the house.

Just a few years ago, hydrogen stakeholders were anticipating a bonanza of federal and investor support through the new $7 billion Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program. Launched during the Biden administration, the initiative was supposed to stimulate and diversify hydrogen production across the US. The program included space for natural gas extraction as required by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but much of the emphasis was on renewable hydrogen, including biomass resources as well as water electrolysis.

Trump put the program on ice after taking office, except for the natural gas end of things. Shocker!

Still, outside of the program some green hydrogen projects have wriggled through. Earlier this year, for example, the startup TalusAg launched a green ammonia venture in Iowa, featuring a reproduceable business model aimed at producing ammonia fertilizer locally for rural markets.

The E-Fuels Solution: Follow The Money … To Texas

The emerging e-fuels (aka electrofuels) industry is another source of support for the global green hydrogen market. E-fuels stakeholders began drifting into Texas several years ago, lured by copious wind and solar resources along with access to seaports and inland energy infrastructure.

The e-fuels industry leverages green hydrogen and captured carbon to produce synthetic, drop-in replacements for liquid fuels, with SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) being a priority target.

The California startup Infinium was among the first to foray into Texas. The company’s Project Pathfinder e-fuels operation is already up and running in Corpus Christie, and neither competition from China nor the frowning face of the Trump administration has stopped it from moving forward with plans for a second facility.

On May 19 the company dropped word that construction has begun on Project Roadrunner in Texas, near the city of Pecos. The venture was publicized after Infinium closed on financing from A-listers Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst.

“The site is expected to become the world’s largest eFuels production facility when operational, producing 23,000 tonnes per year (7.6 million gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other eFuel products,” Infinium enthused.

Infinium already has offtake relationships with American Airlines here in the US, and with the UK firm IAG, which owns British Airways, Aer Lingus. IAG has already agreed to import its eSAF to the UK.

“Commercial agreements for the project—including feedstock, vendor and offtake contracts — have been structured and de-risked to attract the infrastructure capital and debt required for the continued scaling of the eFuels market,” Infinium emphasized.

If all goes according to plan, production will begin in 2027, with power supplied from a nearby wind farm under the umbrella of NextEra Energy Resources. Infinium also anticipates that the system will overproduce hydrogen, enabling it to pursue additional offtake agreements for green hydrogen as well complete e-fuels.

Green Hydrogen: The Electrolyzer Factor

Infinium has tapped the Massachusetts firm Electric Hydrogen to supply its turnkey “HYPRPlant” electrolyzer system to produce the green hydrogen for Project Roadrunner. According to Electric Hydrogen, the pre-assembled solution can cut the installed cost of green hydrogen by up to 60%, compared to conventional electrolyzers systems. Electric Hydrogen also pre-tests the system before shipping it out, relieving producers from on-site troubleshooting.

In March, Electric Hydrogen announced that its electrolyzer system will be manufactured by the Texas firm Titan Production Equipment. Regardless of global trends, the firm is confident that opportunities persist here on its home turf and in Europe as well.

“The partnership with Titan illustrates how growth in the hydrogen industry creates opportunities for expansion of energy businesses and jobs in Texas,” Electric Hydrogen noted in a press statement.

Perhaps they are on to something. Despite President Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” energy policy, longtime oil and gas stakeholders have been casting around for new business in the clean energy field, and Titan is a good example. The company traces its roots as a manufacturer of oil and gas process equipment back to the 1920’s, and now it is applying that know-how to electrolysis systems.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/green-hydrogen-china-envision-us-infinium.png,N,,2025-05-25 14:56:48.594981

The division boasts strong expertise in catalyst systems that cut emissions, reduce industrial waste, and improve efficiency across chemical manufacturing, refining, and renewable energy.

This move positions Honeywell as a leader in producing blue hydrogen, blue ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuel, directly addressing increasing global regulations for cleaner fuels.

Johnson Matthey is using most sale proceeds to reward shareholders and refocus its business strategy, following a streak of divestitures for a leaner operation.

The deal marks a pivotal shift toward large-scale decarbonization and strengthens both companies’ roles in shaping the future of sustainable industrial technology.

A sleek, steel future glimmers on the horizon as Honeywell International positions itself at the heart of the global push for cleaner energy. The industrial titan—long known for shaping industries from aerospace to advanced materials—has made a bold move, agreeing to purchase Johnson Matthey’s catalyst technologies division for £1.8 billion ($2.4 billion). This transaction, executed entirely in cash, signals not just a merger of assets but the convergence of ambition and expertise, shaking up the landscape of sustainable fuel solutions.

Inside the walls of Johnson Matthey’s London headquarters, teams of engineers and chemists have spent decades refining catalyst systems. These innovations don’t just boost profits—they slash waste, curtail emissions, and vastly improve efficiency in chemical manufacturing, refining, and renewable energy applications. With 1,900 employees spread from London to India and the U.S., the unit reported a robust £86 million operating profit last year, notching a nearly 23% increase over the previous period—a testament to the surging demand for cleaner industrial processes.

On the global stage, regulators are sharpening their focus on green mandates. Honeywell’s acquisition is a direct response to mounting pressure: both governments and consumers want cleaner fuels now. Honeywell’s CEO, Vimal Kapur, envisions an energy ecosystem where advanced catalysts play starring roles in producing blue hydrogen, blue ammonia, and renewable aviation fuel—each representing crucial steps in slashing global carbon footprints while fueling economies.

For Johnson Matthey, already a cornerstone of the UK’s FTSE 250, the sale marks an inflection point. By channeling £1.4 billion of the proceeds back to shareholders and retaining a fraction for leaner, more strategic operations, the company is carving out a sharper, more focused identity. This deal follows a decisive streak of divestitures, including a $700 million sale of its medical device components arm in early 2024.

Teams of elite advisers from Latham & Watkins and Slaughter and May are smoothing the legal terrain, while financial giants like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup orchestrate the numbers behind the scenes. Yet above the legal fine print and boardroom negotiations, the key narrative takes shape: two industrial powerhouses aligning, pooling technology and talent, and accelerating the global race for scalable, commercial clean energy.

The key takeaway: This acquisition isn’t a mere reshuffling of corporate cards. It’s a calculated leap toward decarbonizing some of the world’s most energy-intensive sectors. As catalyst technology takes center stage, Honeywell deepens its commitment to tangible, sustainable innovation, potentially shaping how the world will fuel its future. In a marketplace chasing not just profit but purpose and progress, the stakes have never been higher—or the competitive landscape more exhilarating.

The Iowa Legislature approved House File 639 on May 12. The bill was presented by its proponents as a measure to protect Iowa landowners from the use of eminent domain. The rights of landowners are important, and the state Legislature was the appropriate forum to discuss this issue.

However, House File 639 does not address the matter effectively. Instead of focusing solely on the eminent domain concern, the enacted language will significantly affect — and potentially terminate — projects for reasons unrelated to eminent domain. These provisions will obstruct CO2 sequestration projects that are socially acceptable and beneficial to landowners, ethanol producers, farmers, and citizens.

Therefore, Gov. Kim Reynolds should veto the bill.

Here are some specific issues with House File 639:

Section 9. This provision would alter Iowa Code Section 476.33 to permit intervention in any Iowa Utilities Commission proceeding by state lawmakers, other elected officials, or residents with a ""minimally plausible interest."" There is no definition provided for “minimally plausible interest,” and no geographic restrictions, allowing for potential delays from unrelated entities opposed to agricultural production or proposed projects.

Section 11. This adds insurance requirements for a permittee, in Code Section 479B.13A : “The surety or insurance policy must fully cover … any loss from negligent or intentional discharge from the pipeline.” Insurance coverage for an intentional violation of a permit is not available for purchase, as such a product does not exist.

Section 15. Section 479B.14, subsection 2, would be amended to limit the permit duration to 25 years. It states, ""The commission shall not renew a permit granted to a pipeline that transports liquefied carbon dioxide."" This amendment would eliminate access to markets such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel after the 25-year period.

Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, which we oversee, has been part of the ethanol success story in Iowa since 2009. The company has a significant economic impact on southwest Iowa. The organization employs about 70 people, annually purchases more than 40 million bushels of corn from local farmers, engages with various trades and support entities, and distributes dividends to its 814 shareholders. Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy employees, directors, and shareholders are deeply concerned that the passage of House 639 will have significant adverse effects on our Carbon Capture and Sequestration project currently in progress and will severely restrict the company’s future market opportunities.

Following a comprehensive assessment of sequestration pipeline alternatives, the Board of Directors finalized an agreement with Tallgrass, a leading infrastructure company managing over 10,000 miles of pipelines nationwide. Tallgrass has repurposed an existing pipeline for CO2 transportation that traverses across Nebraska to sequestration sites in Wyoming. Due to Southwest Iowa’s strategic location in Council Bluffs, the company can join ethanol plants in Nebraska to utilize this pipeline.

Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy has already received 100% of the easements from landowners along the pipeline for right-of-way that will allow the pipeline construction. All the easements were voluntary. SIRE and Tallgrass have followed the Iowa Utilities Commission requirements for pipelines that are less than 5 miles long and filed our permit application on Feb. 18, 2025. SIRE has entered into a contract to build the CO2 capture and compression equipment on site at an expected cost of about $45 million. And the company has acquired the necessary equipment and intends to commence construction in the fall of 2025.

The Tallgrass pipeline project, which includes Southwest Iowa, will compensate landowners with an initial payment, and annual royalties based on the volume of CO2 transported through the pipeline. Local communities and fire departments will benefit from Tallgrass’ “community benefits agreement,” which includes $600,000 for training and equipping first responders on the Trailblazer pipeline route and a donation of $500,000 to nonprofits in the counties on the route. The Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy ethanol plant will be able to access low-carbon markets such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel, and farmers will have an improved market for the corn they grow.

House File 639 poses a threat to these developments.

In conclusion, we acknowledge that the Legislature is the appropriate forum for addressing matters such as landowner rights. However, House File 639 fails to consider projects like ours, where all easements are entirely voluntary. The adverse economic impacts to Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy are significant and cannot be overlooked.

It is imperative that Reynolds veto House File 639.

Vale la pena citare il bacino amazzonico, che è la più grande riserva di acqua dolce del pianeta, e l’infinita varietà di piante tropicali messa a disposizione da un territorio immenso e ricco di biodiversità. L’ultima trovata suggerisce un binomio fantascientifico: usare una pianta parente dei friarielli per far volare gli aerei. Spieghiamoci meglio: il cavolo d'Abissinia, detto anche senape abissina (nome scientifico “Brassica carinata”), è della stessa famiglia della colza, dei cavolfiori e dei broccoli, e si può coltivare come sovescio invernale, cioè tra una coltura e l’altra, tanto che in Sudamerica è chiamato «la soia d’inverno» per le sue proprietà oleaginose da sfruttare negli intervalli del raccolto della materia prima più conosciuta, di cui il Brasile è peraltro primo produttore mondiale.

Ora il Paese sudamericano si candida a diventare anche il primo produttore mondiale di “carinata”: secondo Nuseed, l’azienda statunitense che ne detiene la maggiore quantità di germoplasma, la produzione brasiliana esploderà del 900% quest’anno, passando da 10mila a 100mila tonnellate. Da questa pianta praticamente sconosciuta si può estrarre biocombustibile per soddisfare la crescente domanda di Saf - Sustainable Aviation Fuel – e raggiungere l’ambiziosissimo traguardo che il settore aereo mondiale si è posto, cioè di diventare al 100% carbon free entro il 2050. Insomma, una pianta utilizzata per la rotazione colturale può rivoluzionare il trasporto aereo, ad oggi responsabile di circa il 3% delle emissioni globali di CO2 prodotta dall'attività umana. Un dato che può sembrare piccolo ma che in termini assoluti è significativo, considerando che l'aviazione ha raddoppiato le sue emissioni di anidride carbonica dal 1990 al 2019.

Quando la “carinata” è matura, è in grado di assorbire carbonio e restituire nutrienti al terreno, riducendo le emissioni ad effetto climalterante. In 3 tonnellate/ettaro di granella raccolta vi è circa un 36,8% di olio: si tratta di un rendimento inferiore a quello della colza e del lino, però con maggiori concentrazioni di acido erucico, il che rende l'olio non commestibile ma appunto molto adatto ad usi industriali oltre che come fertilizzante naturale dei terreni, facilitando l’attività agricola. La “carinata” infatti è particolarmente resiliente e si adatta a condizioni climatiche estreme, come quelle del Brasile che è uno dei Paesi più esposti agli effetti del riscaldamento globale, registrando continuamente ondate di calore, siccità, inondazioni. La sua capacità di migliorare la salute del terreno è inoltre un grande alleato contro l’uso di fertilizzanti chimici e il Brasile ha bisogno pure di questo, dato che è il primo esportatore mondiale di ben 10 commodities agricole (caffè, carne bovina, zucchero, etc) ma che nel 2024 ha registrato il record di pesticidi: il governo ne ha autorizzati 663, nel 2000 erano solo 82.",https://www.avvenire.it/c/2025/PublishingImages/3d77e0dea76a4704a89a9579350a71e3/cari.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 07:56:13.477122

Metafuels and Evos Rotterdam are working together to take the next steps to progress the development of the project. Evos is a liquid energy and chemicals storage company in Europe committed to supporting innovative energy solutions.

This project builds on Metafuels’ expanding European footprint, following the 2024 announcement of Pizol—its planned production facility in Denmark. The Rotterdam plant, named Turbe, will initially produce 12,000 liters of e-SAF per day, with plans for a second phase to increase production tenfold to 120,000 liters per day.

The Evos Rotterdam terminal is a dedicated multimodal methanol hub and the largest ethanol storage provider in Europe. It offers full connectivity across vessel, barge, truck, and rail, with facilities to store renewable methanol that meets International Methanol Producers and Consumers Association (IMPCA) specifications.

As a promising alternative to fossil fuels, renewable methanol plays a critical role in sectors where decarbonization is challenging, serving as a clean bunker fuel in marine transport and as an intermediate product in sustainable aviation fuel production, particularly within innovative e-SAF pathways.

Metafuels’ aerobrew technology converts sustainably produced methanol into jet fuel with high energetic efficiency and ultra-high carbon conversion. The result is a drop-in fuel that reduces life cycle emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional jet fuel, without requiring aircraft re-engineering or infrastructure changes.

aerobrew SAF plants can process bio-methanol or e-methanol interchangeably, allowing the production of bio-SAF or e-SAF, or both simultaneously, in response to market signals. Bio-methanol can be produced, for example, from biological waste, while e-SAF uses renewable electricity and captured carbon to create synthetic fuels, offering a truly scalable and future-proof solution for aviation decarbonization.

The development of the Turbe plant is progressing steadily, with key milestones already achieved. The next phase for Metafuels will be the launch of front-end engineering and design (FEED), followed by a Final Investment Decision (FID) in mid-2026.

The project aligns with major European sustainability initiatives, including RefuelEU Aviation, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), and other legislation aimed at advancing the aviation industry’s transition to net-zero emissions.

Europe is expected to lead the adoption of synthetic or e-fuels, driven by strong regulatory support. Policymakers are relying on a substantial increase in e-SAF capacity over the next decade, with the EU’s synthetic SAF sub-mandate set to begin at 1.2% from 2030 rising to 35% from 2050.",,N,,2025-05-25 03:56:07.476156

Zorzoli analizza un articolo di Susanna Tamaro che parla di sostenibilità e cambiamento climatico

Lo scorso 21 marzo il Corriere della Sera ha pubblicato un articolo, intitolato “L’ansia green non salverà il pianeta”, ad opera dell’autrice di romanzi bestseller Susanna Tamaro. Dopo aver affermato di essere sempre stata in prima linea nella difesa della natura, come testimoniano la sua casa da 25 anni alimentata da energia solare, l’utilizzo della bicicletta per spostamenti locali e di una piccola auto ibrida per quelli più lunghi, e vivendo in campagna con l’autoproduzione di ciò che mangia, per cui “in un ipotetico paradiso dell’impronta carbonica volerei immediatamente nell’empireo dei cherubini”, la Tamaro, un po’ ottimisticamente, sostiene che 50 anni fa la preoccupazione per la salvaguardia dell’ambiente era patrimonio di una minoranza di appassionati, mentre ora coinvolge la stragrande maggioranza degli abitanti del pianeta.

GLI STRAVOLGIMENTI DEL CLIMA

Come scrive l’analista G.B. Zorzoli nell’ultimo numero della rivista Pianeta Terra, “occorre però ricordare che tutta la storia della terra e dell’evoluzione del vivente è stata segnata da stravolgimenti climatici, ma solo con l’irrompere dell’antropocene il rapporto si è unilateralmente sbilanciato” e saper sempre distinguere tra il bene e il male. Questa premessa l’autorizza a manifestare una grande inquietudine per alcune terapie che ci vengono prescritte per salvare il mondo.

IL CLIMA ITALIANO E IL CAPPOTTO TERMICO

“Che dire, ad esempio, del cappotto termico? In un Paese dal clima ormai tropicalizzato come il nostro, che senso ha fasciare le case con un materiale che impedisce la traspirazione dei muri, creando sacche di umidità pessime per la solidità degli edifici e per la salute di chi ci vive dentro?”.

Provi a suggerirlo ai trentini o ai valdostani. Questo è però solo l’antipasto. Secondo la Tamaro, in un Paese come l’Italia, ormai privo di vento (sic!), e custode di un patrimonio di bellezza ambientale e architettonica unica al mondo, le pale eoliche rischiano di essere un inutile scempio, anche perché “le pale rimarranno in testimonianza di un Paese che ha venduto la sua primogenitura di bellezza per un piatto di lenticchie”. Evidentemente troppo occupata a scrivere, Susanna Tamaro non ha tempo disponibile per documentarsi, dato che ignora l’obbligo di smantellamento dei parchi eolici a fine vita e, preoccupata, si chiede “quanta energia producono le pale tristemente immobili disseminate sul nostro territorio? Sarebbe utile saperlo, per capire se il gioco vale davvero la candela”.

LA QUESTIONE DELLE AUTO ELETTRICHE

Non contenta, la Tamaro se la prende anche con l’auto elettrica, “utilissima nelle città congestionate, se si ha la fortuna di possedere un garage con la ricarica, ma assolutamente folle se si decide di imporla a tutti mezzi di locomozione da qui a 10 anni, mentre non si fa mai menzione dell’ormai affollatissimo cielo in cui milioni di aerei scaricano quotidianamente i loro agenti inquinanti nell’atmosfera”; come se non esistessero i Sustainable Aviation Fuel e gli ETS per gli aerei.

Insomma, la Tamaro ci ricorda l’austriaca “eccellenza” a cui in “Sant’Ambrogio” finge di rivolgersi il poeta Giuseppe Giusti. “Che fa il nesci, Eccellenza? O non l’ha letto? Ah, intendo: il suo cervel, Dio lo riposi, in tutt’altre faccende affaccendato, a questa roba è morto e sotterrato”. Dopo di che, la Tamaro sferra il colpo finale: intorno al cosiddetto green si addensano importanti capitali.

LE PROPOSTE DI SUSANNA TAMARO PER CONTRASTARE IL CAMBIAMENTO CLIMATICO

Di conseguenza, forse per evitare indebiti arricchimenti, propone di dare per scontato che il cambiamento climatico è in atto e di utilizzare tutte le risorse tecnologiche e scientifiche che abbiamo a disposizione per mitigarne gli effetti. E, come esempi di soluzioni alternative, elenca la costruzione di dissalatori, la selezione di sementi capaci di crescere in ambienti avversi, l’utilizzo razionale dell’acqua piovana, le colture di frutti tropicali in Sicilia (non le pale eoliche, per carità).

LA POSIZIONE DI LUCIO CARACCIOLO DI LIMES

Con qualche mese di ritardo, Susanna Tamaro replica sostanzialmente le conclusioni di un altro intellettuale. Nel numero di novembre 2024 della rivista “Limes” da lui diretta, in un lungo editoriale, Lucio Caracciolo dichiara che “la battaglia contro la CO2 è perduta”. E, come risposta al presunto fallimento della politica di mitigazione, propone l’egoismo di gruppo: adattarsi per salvarsi, rendendo più resilienti le strutture e le infrastrutture del proprio Paese, in tal modo prolungandone la sopravvivenza, pur consapevoli che prima o poi il cambiamento climatico renderà comunque impossibile sopravvivere.

IL RUOLO DEGLI INTELLETTUALI

Nel suo saggio del 1927 “La Trahison des Clercs (“Il tradimento dei chierici”)”, Julien Benda, allora un importante opinion maker, criticò gli intellettuali francesi e tedeschi che tradivano il valore della giustizia e della democrazia, dedicandosi sempre più a “passioni politiche”, per alcuni la lotta di classe, per altri il nazionalismo. Allora gli intellettuali erano un punto di riferimento, in grado di orientare l’opinione pubblica.

Airbus sees Thailand not just as a hub for Aircraft Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) services but as a significant centRE for advanced technology and engineering within the region’s aviation sector.

Stanley pointed out that the Asia-Pacific region is the fastest-growing aviation market in the world, and Airbus forecasts a demand for about 20,000 new aircraft in the region over the next 20 years, accounting for half of the global aircraft demand. Thailand is identified as one of the largest markets within this growth, he said.

“This year, we expect to deliver a total of 820 aircraft globally, with the majority of orders coming from the Asia-Pacific region,” he said. “In Thailand, Airbus aircraft are operated by Thai Airways International, Bangkok Airways, Thai AirAsia, and Thai VietJet. Soon, Thai Airways will be launching its A321neo aircraft, featuring a new business-class seating configuration by the end of this year.”

Stanley further emphasised that Airbus is committed to supporting Thailand’s aviation industry, contributing to the country's economic development. The aviation sector in Thailand plays a key role in employment, with over 130,000 jobs and contributing over seven per cent to the country’s GDP before the Covid-19 pandemic. Thailand is also recognised as a leader in sustainability in the region.

Additionally, Airbus believes Thailand has the potential to produce more than five million tonnes of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) annually. The country’s agricultural sector, which can provide excellent raw materials for SAF production—such as molasses, rice straw, corn stalks, and animal waste—aligns with Airbus’s commitment to working with the Thai government and SAF producers to promote sustainable aviation fuel production.

To further underscore its commitment to Thailand, Airbus has invested in a new 1,200-square-metre office in the country, which also houses NAVBLUE, Airbus’s digital aviation operations unit. The new office will serve as a testing and verification centre for software solutions before delivery to global airline customers.

Além do coco, Dr. Antônio viu potencial em plantas nativas do Cerrado, como o babaçu e a macaúba.","A trajetória do médico goiano Antônio Carlos Martins da Cunha de 70 anos começa em Porangatu, Norte de Goiás, onde nasceu, passa por Londres, Áustria e termina – ou melhor, recomeça, com um projeto ambicioso para sua terra natal: transformar o município em um centro de referência na industrialização do Babaçu. O objetivo é produzir biocombustível (conhecido como “querosene verde”) e grafeno, revolucionando a economia local e promovendo o reflorestamento indireto do Cerrado.

Conhecido na Europa como Dr. Antonio Martins, o goiano concedeu uma entrevista exclusiva ao Jornal Opção, diretamente de Viena, capital da Áustria, onde vive com a mulher e os três filhos — todos médicos.

Durante a conversa, ele compartilhou detalhes de sua trajetória desde os 16 anos, quando conquistou uma bolsa para estudar na Inglaterra. Falou sobre sua formação em medicina pediátrica e engenharia de alimentos, sua atuação como empresário e os novos projetos que envolvem sua cidade amada, Porangatu.

“Eu não quero só visitar Porangatu. Eu quero retribuir. É uma responsabilidade com as minhas origens”, afirma Antonio Martins, que vive na Europa há mais de 40 anos. “Agora é a hora de devolver com trabalho e tecnologia.”

Raízes goianas e salto para a Europa

A família Martins tem longa história em Porangatu, pois faz parte da fundação da cidade. O bisavô de Antônio, Eusébio Martins, foi o primeiro prefeito da cidade. “A minha avó era da família Gonçalves da Cruz, muito tradicional na região. Martins se casava com Gonçalves, sempre foi assim.”

As memórias de infância em Porangatu são vívidas. “Mesmo morando em Goiânia para estudar, as férias eram todas lá. Saía de Goiânia às seis da manhã e chegava às dez da noite. Não tinha estrada. Às vezes o ônibus atolava, tinha que levar farofa porque não tinha comida no caminho”, conta, rindo.

Foi em meio a esse cenário que os pais de Antônio o incentivaram a estudar e explorar o mundo. Aos 16 anos, conseguiu uma bolsa para estudar medicina em Londres. “Trabalhava lavando privada à noite para pagar meus cursos. Fiz medicina, iniciei pediatria em Londres e depois vim para a Áustria. Aqui conheci minha esposa, estamos casados há 41 anos.”

Seus três filhos também seguiram a medicina – são radiologista, pneumologista e ortopedista.

Babaçu como ferramenta de transformação

Após a finalização do curso de medicina e a especialização em pediatria e instalado na Áustria, Martins fundou uma clínica, uma empresa e construiu estabilidade financeira. Agora, seu foco é o Babaçu – fruto abundante no norte do Brasil, mas pouco explorado economicamente.

“Quando vi que os árabes estavam investindo na Macaúba, em Minas Gerais para produzir querosene verde, pensei: ‘o Babaçu tem ainda mais potencial’. É aí que quero apostar.”

Com apoio técnico de instituições como o IBGE, Ministério da Agricultura e estudos da Embrapa, Antonio quer implantar em Porangatu uma indústria para transformar o Babaçu em biocombustível sustentável (SAF) e grafeno, material ultrarresistente e estratégico para indústrias de defesa e tecnologia.

Dr. Antonio que, além de pediatra, também é engenheiro de alimentos, transformou um projeto acadêmico em um império empresarial baseado na água de coco e aposta agora na produção de querosene verde e grafeno a partir de babaçu.

O médico, cientista e pesquisador, como se define, se destacou no combate à obesidade infantil e transformou um projeto científico em uma empresa que hoje distribui água de coco para 24 países da Europa. A Green Coco Europe, com sede em Nuremberg na Alemanha.

Dr. Antonio Martins, no entanto, ampliou a variedade de produtos derivados do coco e, além da água, passou a comercializar leite de coco, iogurte e cappuccino. Todos os produtos são veganos, ou seja, não contêm leite de origem animal.

Com mais de 35 anos de atuação na pediatria, o Dr. Antônio percebeu em seu consultório que a obesidade infantil crescia de forma alarmante. “A obesidade é um problema social, político e econômico. O número de dias que crianças e adultos perdem no trabalho ou na escola por doenças ligadas ao excesso de peso é imenso”, explica.

Especialista em endocrinologia, ele presidiu a Sociedade Europeia de Endocrinologia Pediátrica e voltou à universidade nos anos 1990 para estudar Engenharia de Alimentos. Durante esse período, descobriu o potencial da água de coco como alimento funcional e saudável — e fez dela o tema de sua tese de doutorado.

O principal desafio? Aumentar a vida útil do produto nas prateleiras. “Se o shelf life (prazo de validade) for curto, o supermercado não compra. Precisávamos chegar a pelo menos um ano de validade”, afirma. Ele conseguiu: desenvolveu e patenteou uma tecnologia de conservação e fundou com a esposa uma pequena empresa para vender água de coco em consultórios médicos. O negócio, no entanto, cresceu vertiginosamente.

Hoje, a empresa é líder de mercado na Europa e está em expansão para os Estados Unidos e Canadá. “Comecei pequeno, mas a demanda cresceu tanto que tive que abrir uma holding na Alemanha e buscar investidores. Hoje, distribuímos para 24 países na Europa e Oriente Médio”, conta.

Apesar de brasileiro, o médico não utiliza mais coco nacional. “O Brasil não atendia à quantidade nem à qualidade necessárias. Hoje, minha matéria-prima vem da Ásia, de fábricas nas Filipinas, Indonésia, Sri Lanka e Índia.”

Mas o aproveitamento do coco não se restringiu à água. Pensando em economia circular, Dr. Antônio Carlos buscou alternativas para o que era descartado como lixo: a fibra e a casca.

Agora, sua nova aposta é o biocombustível sustentável feito a partir dos resíduos do coco e do babaçu: o SAF (sigla em inglês para Sustainable Aviation Fuel), além da produção de grafeno, material valioso na indústria tecnológica e de defesa.

Impacto ambiental e social

O projeto de Martins não pretende apenas industrializar. Ele prevê um processo de recuperação ecológica, especialmente do cerrado. “O Babaçu é nativo. Só precisa não ser destruído. Onde tem um pé, nascem milhões em volta. O problema é que cortam para plantar soja”, explica.

Segundo ele, a iniciativa pode evitar o avanço da desertificação, recuperar nascentes e proteger a fauna. “É o bioma mais rico do Brasil. Tatu, tamanduá, siriema, lobo-guará… estão desaparecendo. O cerrado precisa de equilíbrio. E o Babaçu pode trazer isso.”

Martins destaca ainda que existe uma lei federal que protege as quebradeiras de coco de Babaçu, permitindo acesso ao fruto mesmo em terras privadas, o que reforça o papel social do projeto. “Hoje, o óleo do Babaçu não tem valor agregado. Mas com a industrialização, isso muda. É uma revolução social e ambiental.”

Babaçu é elo entre Cerrado e Amazônia e símbolo de futuro sustentável, diz pesquisador

Para o pesquisador, o Brasil abriga dois ecossistemas fundamentais para o equilíbrio ambiental do planeta: a Floresta Amazônica e o Cerrado. Entre esses dois biomas, ele destaca a existência de uma zona de transição extremamente rica em biodiversidade e com alto potencial para o desenvolvimento sustentável.

“O coco babaçu se destaca como um verdadeiro símbolo de regeneração e equilíbrio ecológico”, afirma Martins.

O Cerrado, segundo o especialista, é o “coração hídrico do Brasil”, por abrigar uma vasta biodiversidade adaptada ao clima seco e alimentar as principais bacias hidrográficas do país. “Infelizmente, mais da metade desse bioma já foi desmatada”, alerta.

É nesse contexto que o babaçu ganha protagonismo. De acordo com Martins, a palmeira nativa tem o poder de fazer a conexão entre os biomas brasileiros. “O babaçu é resistente, regenerador e cresce espontaneamente em áreas de transição. Ele representa uma ponte viva entre a Amazônia e o Cerrado”, explica.

O valor ambiental do babaçu é amplo: “Ele recupera solos degradados, previne a erosão, mantém a umidade e atrai fauna, contribuindo para o reflorestamento natural com espécies nativas.”

Além dos benefícios ecológicos, o babaçu também possui grande importância econômica e social. “A cadeia do babaçu gera renda para comunidades tradicionais e para milhares de mulheres quebradeiras de coco. Ela impulsiona a economia de base florestal, reduz o êxodo rural e promove a inclusão produtiva”, destaca.

Para o pesquisador, fortalecer essa cadeia produtiva é um dos caminhos mais promissores para a sustentabilidade no país. “Precisamos de políticas públicas consistentes e incentivos à bioeconomia, com foco na recuperação de áreas degradadas por meio de espécies nativas.”

Martins defende que preservar a Amazônia e o Cerrado deve ser uma ação conjunta. “O babaçu é o elo vivo entre esses dois biomas e um verdadeiro símbolo de um futuro sustentável. Proteger o babaçu é proteger os corações verdes do Brasil”, conclui.

O modelo de financiamento

Para viabilizar o projeto, Martins busca apoio institucional. “Existem recursos. A União Europeia pode liberar verbas se houver garantias. Tenho cartas de intenção de grandes empresas de defesa interessadas no grafeno. Mas também preciso do apoio político no Brasil”, diz.

Segundo ele, o BNDES e fundos ambientais são fontes possíveis. A proposta é montar uma parceria ampla, com participação de empresários, produtores e governo. “Não é o meu projeto. É o nosso projeto”, reforça.

Caminho sem volta

A última vez que Dr Antonio Martins pisou em Porangatu foi há mais de quatro décadas. Agora, articula com parentes e lideranças políticas locais, como o ex-deputado Carlos Rosenberg e o primo Elilmar Gonçalves – para viabilizar a instalação da indústria. “Estamos unindo forças. Sozinho não dá. É como o monumento do Palácio das Esmeraldas, com várias mãos levantando o mastro.”

Ele acredita que a iniciativa pode transformar Porangatu num polo industrial limpo e sustentável, com geração de empregos e valorização regional. “Porangatu pode ser a nova Arábia Saudita, mas do biocombustível.”

E conclui: “Se eu consegui trazer água de coco para a Europa, por que não vou conseguir isso? Só saio desse planeta depois de deixar esse projeto de pé”, afirma.

O salto para o biocombustível e o grafeno

Há cerca de 10 anos, Dr. Antonio Martins passou a investir na pesquisa de derivados do coco para produção de combustíveis sustentáveis. Com apoio do Instituto SENAI de Inovação (Cimatec), em Salvador, passou a desenvolver SAF — querosene verde para aviação.

“Todos os países estão criando legislações para reduzir as emissões de carbono. O Brasil, por exemplo, já exige que 1% do combustível de aviação seja SAF, aumentando a cada ano. Isso cria uma demanda bilionária”, explica.

Além do coco, Dr. Antônio viu potencial em plantas nativas do Cerrado, como o babaçu e a macaúba. “O babaçu é uma planta ancestral, com papel fundamental na conservação hídrica do Cerrado e da Amazônia. Sua casca dura pode ser carbonizada e transformada em grafite e, depois, em grafeno.”

O grafeno, destaca, é o material mais resistente do planeta e está presente em tecnologias de ponta — de telas sensíveis ao toque a componentes de drones e mísseis. “A Europa está se rearmando por causa da guerra na Ucrânia. A demanda por grafeno vai explodir.

Porangatu no centro da nova fase

O médico-empresário planeja agora um projeto de impacto ambiental, econômico e social: transformar sua cidade natal em polo de produção de biocombustíveis e grafeno. “Porangatu está no coração do Cerrado. A região é estratégica para o plantio de babaçu e macaúba, e pode se tornar referência mundial em energia limpa.”

Ele já abriu uma empresa no Brasil em parceria com um investidor do Ceará e mantém diálogo com grupos internacionais interessados em financiar a recuperação do Cerrado por meio de cadeias produtivas sustentáveis. “Só plantar árvores na Amazônia não basta. Sem o Cerrado, a floresta não sobrevive. Precisamos recuperar o bioma e dar valor econômico às plantas nativas”, defende.

A visão de Dr. Antônio Carlos vai além do lucro. Ele acredita que a sustentabilidade é o caminho para transformar realidades locais e enfrentar desafios globais. “O produto mais valioso hoje é a energia. E temos, aqui no Brasil, condições únicas para produzi-la de forma limpa, eficiente e sustentável.”

Com um pé na ciência e outro nos negócios, o médico de Porangatu se tornou uma ponte entre o conhecimento acadêmico e soluções de mercado que podem ajudar a frear as mudanças climáticas e impulsionar o desenvolvimento econômico verde.

Grafeno: o material do futuro que pode revolucionar a indústria e a tecnologia

Descoberto em 2004 pelos cientistas Andrei Geim e Konstantin Novoselov, o grafeno é apontado como um dos materiais mais promissores da ciência moderna. Composto por uma camada única de átomos de carbono organizados em estrutura hexagonal, ele é considerado o material mais leve e resistente já conhecido — e ainda se destaca pela alta condutividade elétrica e térmica.

A relevância da descoberta foi reconhecida com o Prêmio Nobel de Física em 2010. Desde então, o grafeno vem atraindo atenção global por seu potencial em diversas áreas. Com o objetivo de acelerar a pesquisa e aplicação comercial desse material, a União Europeia criou o projeto internacional “Graphene Flagship”, que investe em inovações tecnológicas baseadas nessa estrutura incomum.

Aplicações que já despontam

As possíveis aplicações do grafeno são amplas e impactam desde a indústria até o setor de saúde. Entre os usos com maior potencial, estão:

Modernização de redes elétricas;

Fontes de luz mais eficientes energeticamente;

Novos semicondutores para a chamada spintrônica;

Revestimentos anticorrosivos mais duráveis;

Sistemas de purificação e dessalinização da água;

Comunicação por meio de sistemas optoeletrônicos.

A pesquisa também avança para o uso do grafeno em estruturas de veículos, como carros, aviões e navios, com o objetivo de torná-los mais leves e resistentes. Em combinação com outros materiais, como borracha, o grafeno pode originar compostos condutores de calor, como uma borracha termicamente condutiva. Já foram desenvolvidas inclusive folhas de “papel de grafeno”, extremamente fortes e capazes de conduzir eletricidade.

Propriedades únicas

O grafeno possui uma combinação rara de características que o tornam objeto de estudo intensivo:

Mecânicas: mais resistente que o aço e altamente flexível;

Elétricas: excelente condutor de eletricidade, ideal para eletrônicos;

Térmicas: dissipa calor mais rápido que qualquer outro material conhecido;

Químicas: é quimicamente estável, com baixa reatividade.

Presente e futuro da aplicação

Hoje, o grafeno já começa a ser incorporado em protótipos de telas sensíveis ao toque, baterias, sensores biomédicos, materiais de construção e até mesmo na indústria da moda. Na saúde, promete avanços em próteses, tratamento de câncer e liberação controlada de medicamentos. No setor energético, é estudado para o desenvolvimento de supercondensadores e painéis solares mais eficientes.

Apesar de suas vantagens, a produção em larga escala do grafeno ainda enfrenta desafios, principalmente relacionados ao custo e à complexidade para manter a qualidade do material.

Potencial revolucionário

Pesquisadores acreditam que o grafeno pode causar uma revolução comparável à do silício nos anos 1950. Com sua combinação de leveza, resistência e condutividade, o material é visto como peça-chave para o avanço de diversas tecnologias nos próximos anos.

Grafeno avança na biomedicina com aplicações em diagnóstico, terapias e combate a infecções

O grafeno tem se destacado como uma promissora inovação na área da biomedicina, com aplicações tanto diagnósticas quanto terapêuticas. Na forma de óxido, o material apresenta alta biocompatibilidade e solubilidade, facilitando a administração precisa de medicamentos, como anti-inflamatórios e agentes anticancerígenos.

Sua excelente condutividade térmica permite o uso em tratamentos contra o câncer, com a destruição de tumores por meio de termolesão — técnica que utiliza calor para reduzir dores e tratar tecidos lesionados. Já estão em desenvolvimento roupas e acessórios médicos aquecidos com o material.

Além disso, folhas de grafeno funcionam como biossensores em dispositivos portáteis capazes de detectar doenças como câncer, epilepsia e Parkinson. Uma sonda desenvolvida por pesquisadores poloneses promete revolucionar exames de ECG, ao medir sinais diretamente do coração.

O grafeno também se mostra eficaz no combate a infecções, graças às suas propriedades antibacterianas, e pode ser base para novos desinfetantes e curativos. Na engenharia de tecidos, andaimes de grafeno têm se mostrado altamente resistentes e capazes de acelerar a regeneração celular e a diferenciação de células-tronco.

Novo, mas promissor

Você já imaginou recarregar seu smartphone em apenas 15 minutos e só precisar conectá-lo à tomada uma semana depois? Ou ainda poder dobrar, amassar e contorcer seu aparelho telefônico sem comprometer seu funcionamento? Pois é, tudo isso pode se tornar realidade em alguns anos, graças ao grafeno.

A descoberta ainda é recente, o que explica por que muitas pessoas ainda não conhecem esse material e seus benefícios. No entanto, em breve ele estará presente em nossos tablets, smartphones e outros dispositivos do dia a dia. A era do grafeno está apenas começando.

Pipeline bill threatens infrastructure and Iowa’s economy

Veto the anti-pipeline bill. Let’s get it right next year.

Iowa’s ethanol industry stands at a crossroads. For decades, we’ve fueled America’s cars with homegrown energy. But as electric vehicle sales rise — 1.3 million in 2024 alone, now nearly 10% of new cars — we must evolve to stay competitive.

Enter Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) — the biggest opportunity Iowa agriculture has seen in decades. Planes won’t run on batteries anytime soon, and SAF needs low-carbon, liquid fuel. That’s a lane Iowa ethanol can dominate, but only if we have the infrastructure to compete.

Carbon capture unlocks that path. By storing CO2 emissions from ethanol plants, we lower the carbon intensity of ethanol and qualify for the booming SAF market — a market projected to demand billions of gallons annually. That means stronger corn demand, more stability for farmers, and long-term investment in Iowa’s future.

This isn’t theoretical. More than 1,320 Iowans have voluntarily signed easements with Summit Carbon Solutions to make this future real. In some counties, voluntary participation is 70%, 80%, even 90%. These are farmers and landowners — people who understand exactly what’s at stake and are choosing to lead.

That’s what makes the legislation passed by the Iowa House and Senate so disappointing. It doesn’t get the job done. It doesn’t solve the problem. And it sets back the very industry it claims to support.

Today I am asking Gov. Kim Reynolds to veto this bill.

Not because she supports any one company, but because she supports Iowa’s largest industry — agriculture — and one of its most important products — ethanol. She knows what’s at stake for our state, and for the 42 ethanol plants already producing 4.6 billion gallons annually. Without access to SAF markets, we’re cutting off their future.

This bill is a step backward. It adds confusion, weakens our competitive edge, and threatens the kind of private investment Iowa needs to grow. And the unintended consequences are real. This bill doesn’t just apply to carbon pipelines — it affects all hazardous liquid infrastructure. If we start blocking one type of project, what’s next? Today it’s ethanol infrastructure — tomorrow it could be broadband, transmission lines, or even rural water systems. That’s a slippery slope Iowa can’t afford.

Let’s come back next year and do it the right way. Let’s bring agriculture, ethanol producers, landowners, and lawmakers to the table and find a real solution that balances property rights with progress. That protects our rural communities while paving the way for market access and long-term growth.

The sky’s the limit for Iowa — but only if we clear the runway. Governor Reynolds, veto this bill.

Bill Couser, Nevada

Pipeline bill threatens infrastructure and Iowa’s economy

House File 639, passed late in the 2025 session, would spell disaster for critical oil and gas pipelines and infrastructure development across Iowa.

Agriculture — the state’s top industry — is vitally dependent on affordable, reliable energy delivered by pipeline. Iowa has few natural gas or oil resources and no refineries. Yet, the natural gas and oil industry drives much of the economy in the state, supporting 117,000 jobs and nearly $10 billion in economic output.

More than 42,000 miles of pipelines lie beneath Iowa’s rich soil, quietly and safely delivering energy to working families, ag producers, and many other sectors. Certainty and stability are essential to maintain this critical infrastructure network.

House File 639 would undermine that. It creates sweeping intervenor rights, allowing Iowans with no direct stake to intervene and delay or derail infrastructure projects. This would inject immense uncertainty into a process that depends on predictability, threatening future investment.

Worse, the bill imposes unprecedented and unfeasible insurance mandates on pipeline developers. Companies must pay for coverage for residents who can’t get insurance or whose premiums go up before a permit is even issued. Developers have no reliable way to confirm who was affected, by how much, or even whether their project was behind the increase. And trying to discern these details raises serious privacy concerns.

House File 639 is poorly written, imposes impossible standards, and threatens Iowa’s infrastructure and economic future.

For these reasons and many more, Gov. Kim Reynolds must veto House File 639.

Once operational in 2027, the facility is expected to become the world’s largest producer of eFuels, generating 23,000 tonnes—or 7.6 million gallons—of sustainable aviation fuel and other low-emission fuel products annually, reports Mrt.

These fuels will be supplied to major customers, including American Airlines and IAG, the parent company of British Airways and Aer Lingus.

eFuels are synthetic alternatives to fossil fuels, made from waste carbon dioxide and renewable energy. They are chemically identical to traditional fuels but with a lower carbon footprint. “We use waste CO2 as a key input and have a strong partnership with Kinetik Holdings to make that happen,” said Robert Schuetzle, CEO of Infinium.

In addition to supporting clean fuel production, Project Roadrunner offers new revenue opportunities for oil and gas partners by transforming CO2 into a valuable product.

Schuetzle noted that Infinium has experience building in West Texas, calling the region’s labor force strong and local officials supportive. The project is expected to create a significant number of construction and permanent jobs in areas like operations, maintenance, logistics, and field management.

The plant will be powered by 150 megawatts of new wind energy secured through a long-term agreement with a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources. It will also be connected to the local power grid, allowing for continuous 24/7 operations.

Infinium has selected Electric Hydrogen to supply the project’s 100-megawatt hydrogen production system, called HYPRPlant. The system will generate green hydrogen to help make synthetic aviation fuel and support future hydrogen-related projects.

“This is our first project with Infinium and an important step forward for our operations in Texas,” said Raffi Garabedian, CEO of Electric Hydrogen. “We build our equipment in Massachusetts and assemble it in Texas, which keeps us close to projects like Roadrunner while supporting local industries.”

He added that the contract demonstrates the growing ability of U.S. technology to produce clean hydrogen at an industrial scale for sectors such as aviation, trucking, and shipping.

Most of the fuel produced at the new facility will be exported, according to Schuetzle. “We see this following a similar path to liquefied natural gas—an abundant U.S. energy resource that powers both domestic needs and global demand,” he said.

Along with aviation fuel, Project Roadrunner will produce eDiesel, which is used by companies like Amazon in long-haul trucking, and eNaphtha, which will be sent to Europe for use in plastics manufacturing.

KUCHING, May 24: Sarawak is looking to set up a central body to collect palm oil waste from all 85 mills across the State to make sure there’s enough volume to support downstream industries like biofuel and animal feed.

Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg said he will discuss with Sarawak Minister for Food Industry, Commodity and Regional Development Dato Sri Dr Stephen Rundi Utom and Sarawak Attorney-General Dato Sri Saferi Ali to review Sarawak’s laws on the matter.

“Because when it comes to waste like this, if everyone handles it in small separate groups, there is no economy of scale.

“Some people are not willing to contribute their waste. So, we have to look into the legal aspect,” he said when speaking during the launch of Sarawak Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority’s (SALCRA) Kernel Crushing Plant held at Lubok Antu Palm Oil Mill, broadcast live by Sarawak Public Communication Unit (UKAS) on Facebook today.

Abang Johari further said the Sarawak government may need to make it mandatory—a combined effort between the private sector and the government—to establish a central entity to collect all this waste from the 85 mills.

“That way, we can ensure sufficient volume. When we have volume, we achieve economy of scale, and this allows us to produce the downstream products in a more sustainable way,” he added.

According to him, many mills only produce two or three tonnes of waste each—too little to be useful.

“But if we combine them all, we can get 100 tonnes. That’s where it becomes efficient,” he pointed out.

Earlier in his speech, Abang Johari explained how Sarawak aims to turn palm oil waste into valuable products that benefit smallholders and the State’s economy.

The first key product is animal feed made from the by-products of crushed palm kernels. This feed can be used for livestock such as goats, cattle, and chickens. The Premier highlighted that by integrating livestock farming with oil palm plantations, smallholders can increase their income streams—producing both palm oil and animal products on the same land.

The second product is biofuel, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from biomass derived from palm oil waste. This biofuel can power aircraft, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and supporting Sarawak’s goal of greener energy.

The third downstream product is hydrogen gas, which can be extracted during the processing of palm oil waste. Hydrogen has growing potential as a clean energy source for transportation and electricity generation, including use in Autonomous Rapid Transit (ART) public transportation.

By developing these industries, Sarawak aims to create a circular economy where waste is converted into valuable products—increasing sustainability and providing new income streams for local communities involved in palm oil farming.

Η επιλογή των διυλιστηρίων να επενδύσουν στα βιώσιμα αεροπορικά καύσιμα δεν είναι ούτε συγκυριακή ούτε επικοινωνιακή. Αντίθετα, αποτελεί απάντηση σε μια τριπλή πρόκληση. Πρώτον, οι υποχρεώσεις που απορρέουν από τον κανονισμό ReFuelEU καθιστούν τη συμμετοχή σε αυτή τη νέα αγορά αναπόφευκτη για όποιον θέλει να διατηρήσει μερίδιο σε κλάδους υψηλής κινητικότητας όπως η αεροπλοΐα. Δεύτερον, το SAF προσφέρει ένα από τα ελάχιστα σενάρια πραγματικής απανθρακοποίησης σε τομείς που δεν μπορούν να ηλεκτροδοτηθούν, γεγονός που το καθιστά στρατηγικό καύσιμο για τη νέα εποχή. Και τρίτον, τα διυλιστήρια αναζητούν νέα προϊόντα υψηλής προστιθέμενης αξίας, καθώς η ζήτηση για συμβατικά ορυκτά καύσιμα προβλέπεται να μειωθεί σταδιακά εντός της επόμενης εικοσαετίας. Η επένδυση στο SAF, υπό αυτή την έννοια, λειτουργεί ως αναβάθμιση της ίδιας της παραγωγικής τους ταυτότητας. Σύμφωνα με πληροφορίες, η αγορά δεν ζητεί μόνο συμμόρφωση, αλλά τεχνολογική επάρκεια, επενδυτική σιγουριά και προσβάσιμη πρώτη ύλη, προκειμένου τα βιώσιμα αεροπορικά καύσιμα να περάσουν από τη θεωρία στην πράξη.

Το σημείο εκκίνησης αυτής της μετάβασης εντοπίζεται σε μια τεχνολογία που μέχρι πρότινος λειτουργούσε περιφερειακά ως προς τον στρατηγικό σχεδιασμό: το βιοντίζελ. Στην Ελλάδα, η υποχρεωτική πρόσμιξη 7% FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters) στο πετρέλαιο κίνησης παραμένει βασική υποχρέωση συμμόρφωσης με την ευρωπαϊκή οδηγία RED II. Από αυτή τη βάση εκκινεί η μετάβαση προς τα προηγμένα βιοκαύσιμα, με πρώτο σταθμό το SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel). Ο κανονισμός ReFuelEU Aviation της Ευρωπαϊκής Ένωσης εισάγει νέο πλαίσιο υποχρεωτικής ενσωμάτωσης SAF στα αεροπορικά καύσιμα, ξεκινώντας από 2% το 2025 και φθάνοντας σταδιακά στο 70% έως το 2050. Το SAF είναι jet fuel που παράγεται από ανακυκλωμένα έλαια, λίπη ή οργανικά απόβλητα και μπορεί να μειώσει τις εκπομπές έως και κατά 80%, χωρίς να απαιτείται τροποποίηση στους κινητήρες των αεροσκαφών.

Ήδη από το 2021, η Helleniq Energy συμμετείχε σε πτήσεις της Aegean με καύσιμο που περιείχε SAF, σε πιλοτική εφαρμογή πριν ακόμη τεθεί σε ισχύ η σχετική υποχρέωση. Η εμπειρία αυτή λειτούργησε ως δοκιμή αντοχής για το πιστοποιητικό εφοδιαστικής αλυσίδας, αλλά και για την τεχνική αξιοπιστία του καυσίμου. Σήμερα, προετοιμάζει την κατασκευή της πρώτης πλήρους μονάδας SAF στην Ελλάδα, στην εγκατάσταση της Ελευσίνας, με προγραμματισμένη δυναμικότητα 150 κιλών/ώρα. Η μονάδα θα βασιστεί σε πρώτες ύλες όπως τα υπολείμματα τροφών, τα τηγανόλαδα και τα ζωικά λίπη, ακολουθώντας το ευρωπαϊκό μοντέλο βιωσιμότητας που αποκλείει προϊόντα που ενδέχεται να επιβαρύνουν την τροφική αλυσίδα.

Η στρατηγική δεν εξαντλείται στην αεροπορία. Στη Θεσσαλονίκη, το Green Hub North Project φιλοδοξεί να εξελιχθεί σε κόμβο παραγωγής υγρών καυσίμων χαμηλού άνθρακα, ενσωματώνοντας παραγωγή HVO, βιο-αιθέρων, πράσινου υδρογόνου, καθώς και εγκαταστάσεις αποθήκευσης και ΑΠΕ. Εκεί αναπτύσσονται υποδομές για την παραγωγή HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil), βιο-αιθέρων, πράσινου υδρογόνου, καθώς και εγκαταστάσεις αποθήκευσης και φωτοβολταϊκά. Η συν-επεξεργασία πρώτων υλών φυτικής προέλευσης στις υπάρχουσες μονάδες αποθείωσης, επιτρέπει την παραγωγή «πράσινου ντίζελ» χωρίς μεταβολές στον τελικό χρήστη ή στο σύστημα διανομής.

Halting clean energy plans comes on the heels of a more strategic overhaul BP announced in February.
If major players don't actively invest in and champion the growth of cleaner alternatives, there won't be an economy or environment.","Oil giant BP has ceased a project to produce ""clean jet fuel"" at its Castellon refinery in Spain. The move signals a broader concern and shift in the company's approach to cleaner energy initiatives. BP's decision raises questions about the commitment of major energy corporations to transitioning away from polluting, dirty energy sources.

What's happening?

According to a Bloomberg News report cited by Reuters, BP paused its investment in producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at the Spanish facility. The reason given was ""weaker-than-anticipated growth in the market"" for these cleaner alternatives.

Halting clean energy plans comes on the heels of a more strategic overhaul BP announced in February. The company revealed plans to increase its investments in oil and gas production while slashing spending on renewable energy projects by over $5 billion annually.

Why is BP's backpedaling on clean energy important?

This pivot from a major global energy player like BP is a significant blow to fighting planet-overheating pollution. SAF is considered a crucial tool for reducing the environmental impact of air travel. Moreover, aviation is one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonize.

Slowing or ending investments in cleaner alternatives, while boosting oil and gas operations, denies the urgent need to transition to less polluting energy sources.

BP CEO Murray Auchincloss stated that the energy transition ""has not proceeded at the pace we would have thought,"" citing strong ongoing demand for oil and gas, per Reuters. His perspective might reflect current market dynamics.

Being economical instead of ecological can also become a self-fulfilling prophecy. If major players don't actively invest in and champion the growth of cleaner alternatives, there won't be an economy or environment.

The world needs to turn away from dirty fuels to avoid the worst consequences of an overheating planet. Extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and threats to global food security will occur otherwise. Relying on oil and gas without fostering alternatives delays this vital transition.

What's being done about corporate clean energy?

Despite these setbacks, the broader push for cleaner energy continues globally. Governments are implementing policies to encourage the production and adoption of sustainable fuels and renewable energy. Technological innovations — battery storage, green hydrogen, and SAF production — are advancing, making these options increasingly viable.

Consumers also play a role by supporting companies genuinely committed to sustainability. Both are advocating for stronger climate policies that reduce their carbon footprints. Conscious choices like sustainable travel, energy-efficient homes, or renewable energy projects all work toward this common goal.

Staying informed about corporate actions, like understanding greenwashing tactics, empowers individuals to hold companies accountable. While corporate strategies can result in poor decisions, the collective demand for a cleaner future remains a powerful catalyst for the right change.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BP-sustainable-aviation-fuelimage-rec8EtaVAw3YJbUIh.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 14:56:40.910719

Η κριτική στην Ε.Ε.
Πηγές της αγοράς εκφράζουν προβληματισμούς στο συγκεκριμένο κομμάτι, αναφέροντας χαρακτηριστικά ότι «η Ε.Ε.","Σε «σήμα κατατεθέν» της εσωτερικής αγοράς αναδεικνύονται τα αεροπορικά καύσιμα, σε συνέχεια της αυξανόμενης κίνησης του τουρισμού, με τα νούμερα να δείχνουν αυξητική τάση χρόνο με τον χρόνο.

Ενδεικτικά, πηγές της αγοράς αναφέρουν ότι η ζήτηση αεροπορικών καυσίμων έχει επανακάμψει και ξεπεράσει τα προ πανδημίας επίπεδα, με τη Helleniq Energy, επί παραδείγματι, να μετρά περισσότερες πωλήσεις στην εσωτερική αγορά έναντι των εξαγωγών.

Υπενθυμίζεται ότι, από 1ης Ιανουαρίου 2025, βρίσκεται σε ισχύ ευρωπαϊκός κανονισμός, σύμφωνα με τον οποίο τα αεροπορικά καύσιμα θα πρέπει να εμπεριέχουν 2% SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), ήτοι στοιχεία βιώσιμων αεροπορικών καυσίμων. Σημειώνεται ότι η χρήση βιοκαυσίμων δεν αφορά χρήση τους κατά 100%, παρά μόνο συνδυαστικά με τα κανονικά καύσιμα.

Υπό το πρίσμα αυτό και στο πλαίσιο απανθρακοποίησης των μεταφορών, η Κομισιόν έχει υιοθετήσει μια συγκεκριμένη στοχοθεσία στην πορεία προς το 2050, με αυξανόμενους στόχους πρόσμιξης ανά πενταετία, ξεκινώντας από το 2% το 2025. Ειδικότερα, ο κανονισμός ReFuelEU Aviation προβλέπει υποχρεωτική ενσωμάτωση SAF στα αεροπορικά καύσιμα με 2% φέτος και ακολούθως 6% το 2030, 20% το 2035, 34% το 2040, 42% το 2045 και 70% το 2050.

Ταυτόχρονα, οι στόχοι του ΕΣΕΚ για το SAF ανεβάζουν το μερίδιο από 1,0% το 2025 σε 41,9% το 2040, με προβλέψεις να δείχνουν εκρηκτική αύξηση της χρήσης ανανεώσιμων καυσίμων μη βιολογικής προέλευσης. Ο τομέας των αερομεταφορών είναι υπεύθυνος για το 2,5% περίπου των παγκόσμιων εκπομπών CO2 και το μερίδιο αυτό αναμένεται να αυξηθεί, καθώς αυξάνεται η ζήτηση για τα αεροπορικά ταξίδια. Ως γνωστόν, η Ε.Ε. έχει θέσει στόχο για μείωση των εκπομπών κατά 55% μέχρι το 2030 (Fit for 55 Package) και, στο πλαίσιο αυτό, προχωρά το σχέδιο αξιοποίησης SAF στις αεροπορικές μεταφορές. Ως SAF χαρακτηρίζονται αεροπορικά καύσιμα τα οποία είναι:

Συνθετικά αεροπορικά καύσιμα από ανανεώσιμο υδρογόνο και δεσμευμένο άνθρακα

Προηγμένα βιοκαύσιμα από απόβλητα και υπολείμματα κυρίως

Βιοκαύσιμα που παράγονται από έλαια και λίπη

Ανακυκλωμένα συμβατικά αεροπορικά καύσιμα. Σύμφωνα με ειδικούς της αγοράς, η αξιοποίηση SAF στις αερομεταφορές έχει δυνατότητα να μειώσει τις εκπομπές CO2 έως και 80%. Στην περίπτωση της Ελλάδας εφαρμόζεται ήδη σε πτήσεις της Aegean Airlines σε συνεργασία με την Helleniq Energy.

Χρειάζεται, βέβαια, να σημειωθεί ότι η εν λόγω δραστηριότητα, όπως επισημαίνουν πηγές της αγοράς με γνώση του θέματος, αν και σε πρωτόλειο επίπεδο ωρίμανσης ακόμη, τείνει να αποτελέσει εκ των βασικών δραστηριοτήτων για τα διυλιστήρια της Ευρώπης και δη της Ελλάδας, δεδομένης της πυκνότητας των αερομεταφορών.

Η κριτική στην Ε.Ε. Μια δεύτερη παράμετρος που θα κρίνει την ταχύτητα ανάπτυξης του κλάδου, καθώς και την εφικτότητα των στόχων που έχουν τεθεί σε ευρωπαϊκό επίπεδο, αφορά την πολιτική και θεσμική υποστήριξη που θα τύχει η εν λόγω δραστηριότητα.

Πηγές της αγοράς εκφράζουν προβληματισμούς στο συγκεκριμένο κομμάτι, αναφέροντας χαρακτηριστικά ότι «η Ε.Ε. επιδίδεται σταθερά στην αυστηροποίηση των κριτηρίων για τον ορισμό των βιώσιμων αεροπορικών καυσίμων, όταν στην αντίπερα όχθη, στις ΗΠΑ, τα πράγματα εξελίσσονται πιο συντεταγμένα για την ωρίμανση του κλάδου».

While this article covers only a handful of electrical systems, a comprehensive list of systems and equipment requiring electrical power is shown here.
Electricity power consumption during each phase of flight of a Boeing 777-300ER is shown here.
As such, estimating aircraft electrical power requirements allows aircraft manufacturers and aviation researchers to find alternative ways to source the required amount of energy for aircraft systems.","Aircraft power requirements are driven by the need to offer passengers higher levels of luxury and comfort. Whether it is mood lighting, in-flight entertainment, or power ports for personal devices, aircraft manufacturers ensure sufficient power is generated for onboard systems. This shift has significantly increased the demand for onboard electrical power throughout the cabin.

The magnitude of power consumption onboard aircraft primarily depends on the size of the aircraft (including cabin), the number of passengers, and the phase of flight. The onboard generators must produce sufficient power to facilitate all aircraft occupants during the flight.

Several cabin systems that run on electrical power, such as the environmental control system, lighting system, etc., are shared across the cabin. However, the power required for inflight entertainment systems, reading lights, and power ports depends on the usage. The electrical power requirement on smaller, narrowbody aircraft, such as the Airbus A320 family, ranges between 20 kW and 390 kW.

However, larger aircraft, such as the Boeing 777-300ER, require anywhere between 110 kW and 720 kW, depending on the occupancy rate and phase of flight. The Airbus A380, the world's largest commercial jet, requires between 180 kW and 1,250 kW. This article highlights power requirements for the most common cabin systems, including lighting, in-flight entertainment, and power ports for personal devices.

Electrical Power Requirements of a Boeing 777-300ER

The Boeing 777-300ER is a long-range widebody aircraft with a typical seating for 400 passengers in two classes. While the type has an exit limit of 550 passengers, airlines generally configure their planes to accommodate anywhere between 340 and 420 passengers. With a Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) of 775,000 lb (351,533 kg), the aircraft can fly a range of 7,370 NM (13,649 km; 8,480 miles).

Two GE Aerospace GE90-115B turbofan engines power the aircraft, each generating up to 115,300 lbf (513 kM) thrust at takeoff. Since its launch, it has become a primary driver of the type's sales for the manufacturer and an economical long-haul workhorse for airlines. According to Boeing:

""The Boeing 777's unique combination of superior range, outstanding fuel efficiency, and passenger-preferred comfort has created long-range success for carriers around the world. And the 777-300ER now gives operators a perfect opportunity to extend that success. Recent upgrades further reduce costs and boost revenue, and the 777's flying experience is still number one with passengers. A more profitable fleet and more satisfied passengers. That's a better way to fly.""

The 777-300ER, like most other planes, features a range of systems that require electrical power. While this article covers only a handful of electrical systems, a comprehensive list of systems and equipment requiring electrical power is shown here.

On-seat Power Requirements of a Boeing 777-300ER

While some cabin systems require constant power regardless of the phase of flight or occupancy, on-seat power is based on occupancy and usage. On-seat systems typically include in-flight entertainment (IFE), personal reading lights, and power ports for personal devices.

Theoretically, demands for these systems vary from 50 W to 110 W per passenger, depending on the type of system and usage. Some passengers tend to use their personal devices and charge them onboard, while others spend more time using the in-flight IFE. According to a study published in the Aerospace Journal, researchers conducted passenger surveys and airline statistics to examine the media preferences of passengers during their flights. The study concluded,

""The findings indicated that 20% of respondents reported traveling for business purposes. For this group, it was assumed in the study that they would use their laptops during the flight and recharge them on board. The rest of the passengers spent 44% of the flight time using IFE and 46% using personal electronic devices (PEDs). In flight, 10% of passengers switched between IFE and PEDs. The study also presumed that passengers utilizing PEDs would charge them during the flight.""

As a general rule of thumb, laptops consume approximately 70 W, whereas personal handheld devices, including tablets, consume approximately 15 W. An IFE screen integrated into the back of the seats onboard Boeing 777-300ERs draws anywhere between 15 W and 20 W throughout the flight.

A large aircraft like the Boeing 777-300ER, with its typical seating capacity, cabin length, and maximum takeoff weight, requires approximately 720 kW of electrical power for systems. Notably, taxi-out (before departure) and taxi-in (after landing) phases have the lowest electricity requirement, at 425 kW, whereas cruise has the highest, with 720 kW. Electricity power consumption during each phase of flight of a Boeing 777-300ER is shown here.

Advantages of Calculating Electric Power Requirements For Commercial Aircraft

Research indicates that global aviation is responsible for nearly 2.5% of anthropogenic carbon emissions in the environment. This situation is only getting worse as global air traffic continues to grow. As such, estimating aircraft electrical power requirements allows aircraft manufacturers and aviation researchers to find alternative ways to source the required amount of energy for aircraft systems.

Electrical generators provide power produced through conventional engines, requiring fossil fuels that result in carbon emissions. Engine-driven generators are driven by the gearbox and the high-pressure spool of the engine. To achieve net-zero carbon emissions, hydrogen fuel cells are being used to curb the environmental impact. The technology uses electrochemical energy converters to convert chemical energy into electrical energy without emitting noise or other pollutants into the environment.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/main-image-16_9-52.png,N,,2025-05-24 13:56:12.552006

Των καυσίμων δηλαδή του μέλλοντος, που υπολογίζεται ότι θα ξεπεράσουν παγκοσμίως τα 25 δισ. δολάρια ως το 2030 και τα οποία παράγονται από ανανεώσιμο υδρογόνο και δεσμευμένο άνθρακα, απόβλητα και υπολείμματα από έλαια και λίπη, καθώς και ανακυκλωμένα συμβατικά αεροπορικά καύσιμα.

Το καύσιμο προέρχονταν αρχικά από τη φιλανδική εταιρεία Neste που έχει εργοστάσια στο Ρότερνταμ και τη Σιγκαπούρη, αλλά ο ελληνικός όμιλος συνεργάζεται πλέον με ολοένα και περισσότερους προμηθευτές.

Στόχος για green hub στα καύσιμα

Κοιτάζοντας τη μεγάλη εικόνα, τα νέας γενιάς αεροπορικά καύσιμα αποτελούν ένα κομμάτι μόνο από την προσπάθεια της Helleniq Energy να εξελιχθεί σε όμιλο παραγωγής πετρελαιοειδών χαμηλού άνθρακα, ενσωματώνοντας παραγωγή HVO, βιοαιθέρων, πράσινου υδρογόνου, καθώς και εγκαταστάσεις αποθήκευσης και ΑΠΕ.

Στον Ασπρόπυργο έχει ήδη ολοκληρωθεί μια επένδυση σε βιοαιθέρες που παράγει 160.000 τόνους το χρόνο, ωστόσο το πλέον μεγαλόπνοο project αφορά τη μετατροπή του διυλιστηρίου της Θεσσαλονίκης σε πράσινο.

Σε αυτό δρομολογείται η δημιουργία ενός hub καθαρής ενέργειας, που θα παράγει green hydrogen, αμμωνία και ανακυκλωμένα πλαστικά, ενώ είναι έτοιμη να ξεκινήσει η παραγωγή 45.000 τόνων ετησίως πράσινου ντίζελ. Το συγκεκριμένο προϊόν θα προέρχεται από τη κοινή κατεργασία τηγανόλαδων και ορυκτού ντίζελ.

Στην αγορά των πράσινων καυσίμων κινείται δυναμικά και η Motor Oil που έχει εντάξει στο στρατηγικό της σχεδιασμό την παραγωγή τόσο προηγμένων βιοκαυσίμων (biofuels) όσο και συνθετικών καυσίμων (e-fuels).

Εδώ έχουν τη σημασία τους και οι συνέργειες μέσω της πλατφόρμας της Elin Verde που εξαγόρασε το 2022 με αντικείμενο την παραγωγή και εμπορία βιοκαυσίμων, διαθέτοντας μεταξύ άλλων εργοστάσιο παραγωγής βιοντίζελ στη ΒΙ.ΠΕ Βόλου αλλά και την «Πράσινο Λάδι» που δραστηριοποιείται στη συλλογή και εμπορία χρησιμοποιημένων μαγειρικών ελαίων και ζωικών λιπών (που αποτελούν την πρώτη ύλη για τα βιοκαύσιμα).

Σχήμα στήριξης και πρώτες ύλες

Το πανευρωπαϊκό, ωστόσο, παιχνίδι των νέας γενιάς καυσίμων όπως το SAF, παρ’ ότι η τεχνολογία είναι ώριμη και πιστοποιημένη, απαιτεί μεγάλους όγκους πρώτης ύλης με τις διαθέσιμες ποσότητες τηγανόλαδων, ζωικών λιπών και άλλων αποβλήτων να μην επαρκούν για να καλύψουν τους τεράστιους όγκους που απαιτούνται για την επίτευξη των στόχων του ReFuelEU Aviation.

Δίχως τη ταχεία ανάπτυξη νέων μονάδων επεξεργασίας και χωρίς τη δημιουργία ενός δικτύου συλλογής και προεπεξεργασίας αποβλήτων σε όλη τη χώρα, το στοίχημα δεν πρόκειται να κερδηθεί.

Το ίδιο ισχύει και για την ανάγκη παροχής κινήτρων στους δύο μεγάλους διυλιστηριακούς ομίλους προκειμένου να ενθαρρυνθεί η παραγωγή βιώσιμων αεροπορικών καυσίμων χαμηλού ανθρακικού αποτυπώματος, η ζήτηση για τα οποία θα αυξάνεται όλο και περισσότερο από τις αερομεταφορές.

Η προηγούμενη πολιτική ηγεσία του ΥΠΕΝ είχε προκοινοποιήσει στην Κομισιόν πρόταση για σχήμα στήριξης της παραγωγής SAF στην Ελλάδα, καθώς η έγκριση της Γενικής Επιτροπής Ανταγωνισμού της EE (DG COMP) αποτελεί προαπαιτούμενο για να υπάρξει κρατική επιδότηση.

Το σκεπτικό ήταν ότι οι πόροι θα προέλθουν από το Ταμείο Εκσυγχρονισμού της ΕΕ, ένα νέο εργαλείο για τη στήριξη δράσεων απανθρακοποίησης που χρηματοδοτείται από τα έσοδα του Συστήματος Εμπορίας Δικαιωμάτων Εκπομπών Ρύπων, με τον συνολικό «κουμπαρά» για την Ελλάδα να εκτιμάται σε 1,32 δισ. ευρώ.

Στη προκειμένη περίπτωση, το σχέδιο αφορούσε τις κεφαλαιουχικές δαπάνες (capex) για την δημιουργία των μονάδων παραγωγής, καθώς οι πόροι δεν επαρκούν για να καλύψουν τη διαφορά του κόστους μεταξύ των συμβατικών ορυκτών καυσίμων και των ακριβών συνθετικών καυσίμων, κάτι που συνιστά πρόκληση για ολόκληρη την εφοδιαστική αλυσίδα των SAF, συμπεριλαμβανομένης και της αεροπορικής βιομηχανίας.

From its home at Dubai International Airport (DXB), the airline is celebrating its record $6.2 billion in recorded profit for the financial year ending March 31. How is the airline celebrating such a historic year?

Emirates, the hometown airline for Dubai, competes head-to-head with several other Middle Eastern heavyweights, namely Etihad Airways , Saudia, and Qatar Airways. Emirates has made a name for itself with the Airbus A380, which has flown to a number of key international destinations around the world and offers more seats between London and Dubai than many other carriers combined. It's news that $6.2 billion in annual profit for the 2024 financial year has made this one of the airline's strongest financial performances.

What Has Driven Such Strong Profits?

Emirates has seen a significant increase in revenue compared to the previous financial year; this has been driven by strong passenger demand, more efficient operations, and the continued rebound for long-haul travel in the post-pandemic world. In the last financial year, the airline transported more than 512 million passengers, resulting in an average load factor of 83% on most flights. This has demonstrated strong demand across its entire international network.

The airline's Chairman and CEO, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed, has attributed Emirates' success to the carrier's ability to adapt to new travel trends, including the surge in premium bookings, and the introduction of its hotly anticipated premium economy cabin. The year's strong performance has reflected the resilience of the Middle Eastern carrier and its dedication to growing demand for high-quality air travel. Emirates, which is owned by the government of Dubai's Investment Corporation of Dubai, operates more than 3,600 flights a week from its home at DXB, with direct flights to more than 150 cities across 80 countries.

This year, Emirates continues to expand its international network from Dubai International Airport, one of the busiest airports on the planet. In 2025, Emirates will take off to several new destinations, including Da Nang (from June 2), Hangzhou (from July 30), Shenzhen (from July 1), Siem Reap (from June 3), and Tel Aviv (returning from October 1).

Rewarding Emirates Employees With A Big Bonus

Following Emirates' successful year, the airline will reward its employees with a six-month salary bonus. The carrier decided to give this very generous reward to recognize its staff's continued commitment and contributions to Emirates' overall success. This reward aligns with the airline's traditions of sharing profits with its employees during successful years. Emirates is the world's third-largest airline by scheduled revenue passenger kilometers, and the second-largest by freight tonne kilometers flown.

This benefit, distributed among its tens of thousands of employees, includes all ends of the spectrum, including cabin crew, pilots, ground staff, and administrative personnel. The airline has also enhanced its staff benefits by extending travel discounts and healthcare packages. The airline has reiterated that behind this bonus, its people have been instrumental in achieving such successful results in the last financial year.

The record figure of over $6 billion in profit is the best in the carrier's history and reaffirms the carrier as one of the world's most profitable airlines. The figures that concluded at the end of March represent a year-on-year increase of 18%, with the group's cash assets increasing 13% ($14.6 billion).

Investing In More Aircraft

Emirates is reinvesting huge capital from its financial success in accelerating its fleet modernization program. The Middle Eastern carrier has placed additional orders for the Airbus A350 and Boeing 777X, these aircraft will further drive fuel efficiency and expand the airlines long-haul capabilities.

Emirates has also started retrofitting its existing Airbus A380 fleet (of which it has the largest in the world by a long shot), rejuvenating its cabins, and adding premium economy, a first for the airline in a push to respond to the ever-growing mid-tier luxury travel market. While the Airbus A380 is no longer in production, Emirates remains committed to the double-decker aircraft, deploying it on some of its most iconic and busiest routes, including London, Paris, Christchurch, and New York. Below is a list of aircraft on order with the carrier:

Currently, the Emirates fleet consists entirely of widebody aircraft, a model that the airline expects to continue. Several aircraft types already operate in the airline's network, including four Airbus A350-900, 116 Airbus A380-800, ten Boeing 777-200LR, and 120 Boeing 777-300ER.

Enhancing The Emirates Experience

Not only is Emirates expanding its global network by introducing a number of new routes, but the carrier is also leveraging its partnership with flydubai . The regional, low-cost carrier based at Dubai International Airport is Emirates' sister carrier, operating to a range of short—and medium-haul destinations from Dubai, such as those throughout the Adriatic and neighbouring Middle Eastern countries.

Emirates continues reinvesting in the passenger experience and has seen recent premium cabin upgrades. Expanded menus and dining options have been fueled through partnerships with Michelin-starred chefs, and those who like to sit back and relax with a good film can enjoy more than 6,500 channels on the airline's award-winning ICE entertainment system.

Fast Wi-Fi is also now available across the Emirates fleet, providing both business—and leisure-focused passengers with the ability to stay connected with friends and family around the world during flight. With Emirates being the largest A380 operator worldwide, 81 of its double deckers are progressively being retrofitted with its new premium economy seats.

Remaining Committed To The Carrier's Carbon Neutrality Goals

While Emirates will cash out millions with this year's bonus offer, the airline continues investing heavily in its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Through sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) partnerships and investments for more fuel-efficient aircraft, the airline will reach its net-zero carbon emissions target by the middle of the century.

Passengers and businesses using Emirates can also participate in this programme by offsetting their carbon emissions when booking. Here are some ways Emirates continues to make strides in lowering its carbon footprint:

Other initiatives that have supported this move to lower carbon emissions include electric vehicles in its fleet of cars that chauffeur its flight crew to and from their Dubai accommodations, which alone reduces around 14 tonnes of CO2 per month.

A Bright Future Is Ahead For Emirates

However you may look at it, Emirates's future looks bright. The carrier, synonymous with long-haul, luxury air travel, will head into the 2025 financial year with a stride in its step, coming off the back of a resounding 2024. The airline's $6.2 billion profit underscores its continued dominance in the aviation industry. As of May 2025, Emirates operates a fleet of more than 250 aircraft, with 300 planes expected to be delivered within the next decade.

Emirates' extensive international network, which operates to all six inhabited continents in the world, serves to most major cities across the globe, flying as far as Auckland, Sao Paulo, Toronto, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Cape Town, Antananarivo, Lyon, Oslo, Colombo, Prague, Hong Kong, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Moscow, to name just a few. The airline's dominance has been driven by its strong leadership team and a loyal workforce that is made up of more than 150 nationalities around the world. Many flight attendants and pilots strive to work for the carrier, lured in by free accommodation provided by the airline, chauffeur-driven vehicles to get to and from work, and living in the tourist mecca of Dubai, surrounded by glitz and glamour.

The airline is committed to innovation, where it continues to invest in new strategies and developments that will continue pushing the carrier's envelope. The latest employee bonus and continued fleet upgrades will support the airline's expanding global network, which has positioned the airline well to provide continued growth for the years to come. International travel demand remains high, and Emirates' strategic location in the Middle East allows the carrier to be within only a few hours of huge population centres. With the airline's ability to adapt and reinvest in its future, it is set to remain a key player in the market for decades.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/how-is-emirates-celebrating-its-record-6-billion-profit-performance-16x9.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 12:56:08.088099

Themed “Inclusivity and Sustainability”, the 46th ASEAN Summit and Related Summits are expected to chart fresh pathways for regional cooperation.
Touching on Vietnam – Malaysia relations, the diplomat stressed that PM Chinh’s visit will help deepen the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two countries.
Vietnam has positioned its people as the centre, subject, goal, driving force, and resource for sustainable national development.","In a recent interview with the press, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Do Hung Viet, also Head of ASEAN SOM of Vietnam, stressed that the trip, made at the invitation of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and his spouse, is of significance as it coincides with the 30th anniversary of Vietnam’s ASEAN membership, marking the beginning of the nation’s regional and international process.

It demonstrates Vietnam’s strong support for Malaysia’s role as the ASEAN Chair this year and reflects the shared determination for build a community that embodies sustainability, inclusiveness, solidarity and strength while consolidating ASEAN’s central role in regional peace and stability, he said, highlighting Vietnam seeks to collaborate with other ASEAN member states to shape up strategic orientations and concrete measures to solidify regional cooperation foundation while elevating the bloc’s stature in the coming time.

Vietnam's three-decade ASEAN membership shows that it is increasingly mature, confident, and proactive in both regional bloc participation and broader international integration. This period has confirmed ASEAN as a cornerstone in Vietnam's foreign policy, with General Secretary To Lam emphasising in his speech at the ASEAN Secretariat in January that standing at a new historical starting point, Vietnam and ASEAN are working together towards ambitious goals.

Over the recent past, Vietnam has collaborated closely with other ASEAN nations in developing strategic documents, particularly the ""ASEAN 2045: Our Shared Future"" to be adopted by leaders at this summit. Vietnamese ministries actively contributed from the initial stages, balancing core principles like internal solidarity and ASEAN centrality while proposing innovative, practical ideas to create breakthroughs across all three pillars of politics-security, economy, and socio-culture, and cross-sectoral areas.

Vietnam’s leadership is evident through its role in organising the ASEAN Future Forums in 2024 and 2025, facilitating discussions on essential regional issues and substantively contributing to shaping ASEAN cooperation through 2045.

Themed “Inclusivity and Sustainability”, the 46th ASEAN Summit and Related Summits are expected to chart fresh pathways for regional cooperation.

Vietnam will work with other member states across three priorities, namely reaffirming multilateralism’s values while enhancing ASEAN’s central role in the region amidst strategic volatilities; launching a new roadmap for community building towards a self-reliant, innovative, proactive, and people-centred bloc; and promoting internal and external connectivity through expanded trade-investment cooperation and fair, transparent, and rules-based multilateral trading systems, according to Viet.

Touching on Vietnam – Malaysia relations, the diplomat stressed that PM Chinh’s visit will help deepen the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two countries. Leaders of both sides will exchange notes on specific orientations and measures to inject new momentum and develop the bilateral cooperation and connectivity in a deeper and more effective manner.

He went on to emphasise that the elevation of the bilateral relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership last November represents the most solid assessment and highest expectation for the Vietnam-Malaysia relationship.

Senior leaders of the two countries have maintained regular visits and exchanges, highlighted by General Secretary To Lam's official visit to Malaysia in 2024 and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's visit to Vietnam for attendance at the second ASEAN Future Forum in February 2025.

Recent diplomatic engagement has intensified remarkably, with PM Chinh conducting two telephone conversations with his Malaysian counterpart within a single month to share assessments of the global and regional situation while discussing measures to promote bilateral cooperation and ASEAN collaboration.

Viet described economic cooperation as an important pillar in the Vietnam – Malaysia relationship, stating Malaysia currently ranks as Vietnam's third-largest trading partner within ASEAN and 9th globally, while also standing as Vietnam's third-largest investor among ASEAN countries.

Both countries share similar development aspirations and place people at the heart of national development. Vietnam has positioned its people as the centre, subject, goal, driving force, and resource for sustainable national development.

In June 2018, the Indian government set the MSP of sugar for the first time at Rs 29 per kg, when the FRP for sugarcane was Rs 2,550 per tonne. Since then, while the FRP has steadily increased, rising to Rs 3,550 per tonne for the 2025–26 season, the MSP of sugar has remained unchanged at Rs 31 per kg since February 2019.

In an exclusive interview with ChiniMandi, Tarun Sawhney, Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Triveni Engineering & Industries Ltd, highlights the urgent need to revise the sugar MSP and discusses key issues facing the sugar industry, as well as the company’s strategy and outlook.

Q. India has recorded a decline in sugar production this season compared to the previous year. What, in your view, are the main factors contributing to this drop?

India has recorded a decline in sugar production this season compared to the previous year—from 31.9 million tonnes in Sugar Season (SS) 2023–24 to an estimated 25.74 million tonnes in SS 2024–25 (as of May 15, 2025). This drop can be attributed to a combination of factors. Firstly, adverse weather conditions in key producing states like Maharashtra and Karnataka which led to lower sugarcane yields and reduced availability for crushing. Secondly, diversion of sugarcane juice and B-heavy molasses in line with the Government’s biofuel targets, has also impacted sugar output. Additionally, the crushing season was shorter in some regions due to early exhaustion of sugarcane supplies. Improved plant cane yield and better sugar recovery in the latter half of the season have contributed to extended operations in Uttar Pradesh. Furthermore, special crushing operations in South Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are expected to commence, potentially adding 0.4 to 0.5 million tonnes of sugar to the final tally. Despite the decline in overall production, with a projected closing stock of 5.4 million tonnes and no domestic supply concerns, the industry remains confident about meeting demand and maintaining price stability.

Q. How do you assess the current trends in sugar consumption in India? Are there any change in demand?

The current trends in sugar consumption in India remain steady and largely stable, with no significant decline in domestic demand. Despite a drop in the sugar production there is no visible stress on supply, and price stability has been maintained, indicating that consumption levels have not drastically changed.

India typically consumes around 28 million tonnes of sugar annually, and this year’s projected closing stock of 5.4 million tonnes which will allow to comfortably meet country’s demand for sugar. There’s also no evidence of a demand surge or significant shift in consumption patterns. However, the industry remains watchful as seasonal demand tends to rise during summer months and festive seasons. In that context, continued operations in select mills in UP, TN, and Maharashtra into May are helping manage regional supply efficiently.

Q. How much important role do sugar and ethanol play in the overall business of Triveni Engineering & Industries?

We are one of India’s largest sugar producers, operating eight sugar plants across Uttar Pradesh. We produced ~0.89 million tonnes of sugar in the Sugar Season (SS) 2023-24. In our Alcohol business, we produced over 180 million litres of alcohol during the Financial Year 2023-24, through our five distillery facilities, also located in Uttar Pradesh. Among these, two facilities are multi-feed and can process both molasses and grains, ensuring operational flexibility.

Sugar and Alcohol contributes approximately 90% to our overall turnover. The remaining 10% comes from our engineering operations, which include manufacturing high-speed power transmission equipment such as gearboxes, and another business focused on water and wastewater treatment solutions.

Q. Do you consider the revision of the sugar Minimum Support Price (MSP) and ethanol pricing to be top priorities for the sugar industry at present?

Sugar prices have remained largely stable, with a recent modest uptick of 2–2.5%. However, five years of price stagnation—coupled with rising sugarcane, labour, and operational costs—have severely compressed industry margins. With the FRP for sugarcane now revised to Rs 355/quintal (for Sugar Season 2025-26), revising sugar MSP to Rs 39.14/kg is critical to restore mill viability and ensure fair farmer returns. At Triveni, we continue to lead by example with timely, arrears-free farmer payments.

Agronomic challenges, especially the red rot disease plaguing the CO238 variety, demand immediate investment in resilient sugarcane alternatives for North India’s 25 million farmers—making a sugar price hike even more necessary.

Similarly, ethanol remains a key pillar in farmer income, rural development, and national energy security. While pricing varies by feedstock, ethanol from sugarcane juice commands Rs 65.61/litre, B-heavy molasses Rs 60.73/litre, and C-heavy molasses recently revised to Rs 57.97/litre. The industry expected upward revisions for B-heavy and juice-based ethanol to ease value chain pressures.

India is on track to meet its 20% ethanol blending target, with NITI Aayog now exploring higher thresholds. Achieving these goals hinges on capacity expansion, underpinned by a sustainable ethanol pricing model.

Q. As artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to evolve, how is Triveni adopting these technologies to improve its production processes and operational efficiency?

To increase production, streamline procedures, and improve operational efficiency, Triveni Engineering & Industries Limited is adopting digitalization, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) as essential pillars of our transformation path. Across our sugar manufacturing and other business verticals, we have implemented a comprehensive digital strategy that incorporates cutting-edge technologies, intelligent automation, and advanced analytics.

A major milestone in this journey has been the establishment of our Digital Centre of Excellence (DCoE). This hub is central to driving innovation, enabling us to monitor operations in real-time, predict equipment failures, and make faster, data-backed decisions. By leveraging AI and ML tools, we’re able to improve plant performance, increase equipment uptime, and cut down on energy use—creating a more agile and sustainable manufacturing setup.

We’ve implemented AI-powered solutions in our sugar business to improve logistics, streamline cane buying, and digitize field operations using smart dashboards and GPS tracking. Our supply chain is now more open and effective thanks to these advancements. Furthermore, we can decrease manual interventions and guarantee higher consistency and quality in our output by utilizing IoT-enabled sensors and intelligent automation on the manufacturing floor.

Digitalization is also helping us empower our people. We’re equipping our teams with digital tools and training to foster a culture of innovation and adaptability. By combining human expertise with AI capabilities, we’re making our operations smarter and more responsive.

Looking ahead, we’re actively exploring technologies like digital twins and advanced process control systems to simulate our operations and unlock real-time process improvements. These initiatives are not just about keeping up with Industry 4.0—they’re about leading it. We’re committed to making Triveni a model for how traditional industries can evolve through technology.

Q. Any future plans for Triveni to venture into biogas, SAF, or other areas of the bioenergy business?

At Triveni Engineering & Industries Limited, we’re deeply committed to supporting India’s energy transition, and our growing footprint in the bioenergy sector reflects that. Our primary focus right now is on strengthening ethanol production, in line with the Government’s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) program.

Our production backbone includes five state-of-the-art distillation facilities strategically located across Uttar Pradesh. Notably, our grain-based plants also produce Dried Distillers Grain with Solubles (DDGS)—a high-protein animal feed by-product that has been well received by premium institutions.

While ethanol remains our immediate priority, we absolutely recognize the vast potential in emerging areas of the bioenergy space, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Compressed Biogas (CBG). India is entering a transformative phase—what many are calling an ethanol revolution—where second-generation biofuels, SAF, and CBG are expected to play a major role in the country’s long-term energy roadmap.

Though we haven’t announced specific initiatives in SAF or biogas just yet, we’re closely watching the developments in these areas and exploring opportunities that align with our capabilities and long-term sustainability vision. Our focus is on building scalable, high-impact solutions—and as the ecosystem evolves, we’re ready to diversify and lead wherever the opportunity arises.",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tarun-Sawhney.jpeg,N,,2025-05-24 11:56:20.054675

KUCHING, May 24: Smallholders in Sarawak can boost their income by integrating livestock farming into their oil palm plantations, said Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg.

He explained that this integrated model allows farmers to generate two income streams from the same land—through the production of palm oil and livestock such as goats, cattle, or chickens.

“If we plant oil palm on one hectare of land according to the proper planting structure, there’s space between the trees.

“Why not raise animals in between? Chickens, goats or cattle,” he said when launching the Sarawak Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority’s (SALCRA) Kernel Crushing Plant at the Lubok Antu Palm Oil Mill today.

Abang Johari said the by-products from palm kernel crushing can be processed into animal feed, enabling farmers to feed their livestock at minimal cost using palm-based waste.

He pointed out that cattle prices have soared, with a single cow selling for up to RM12,000 during Hari Raya Aidiladha.

By turning palm waste into feed, rural farmers can rear livestock more affordably and profitably. From just one hectare of oil palm land, they can produce palm oil, raise animals, and feed their livestock at no additional cost.

“If we can produce more goats and cattle, we can export them overseas. That means more income. This is what we call waste-to-energy,” he added.

Abang Johari also highlighted that palm oil waste can be turned into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), reducing reliance on fossil fuels to power aircraft.

“In Singapore, companies like Neste collect used cooking oil from restaurants and turn it into SAF. But in Sarawak, we are doing it using plantation waste, and the value goes back to the farmers,” he said.

He noted that the RM30 million allocated by the Sarawak government to SALCRA served as seed capital to establish the Kernel Crushing Plant in Lubok Antu, designed as a model to demonstrate how downstream activities can benefit smallholders.

“Oil palm smallholders are no longer just oil palm farmers. They can become livestock entrepreneurs too. And with two income streams, the village’s overall earnings will increase,” he said.

While the focus now is on livestock feed and SAF, Abang Johari revealed that kernel processing can also produce hydrogen gas—a clean energy source Sarawak aims to tap in future public transport systems like the Autonomous Rapid Transit (ART).

He also suggested automating waste handling in mills with conveyor belts to reduce labour and improve cleanliness.

Sarawak is the largest oil palm producer in Malaysia based on planted area.

Mærket bruger 29 millioner kroner på 3,8 millioner liter brændstof til resten af flåden.

McLarens Formel 1-biler er ikke de eneste, som kører på syntetisk benzin.

I en netop offentliggjort bæredygtighedsrapport, gør det tidligere britiske bilmærke det klart, at man i 2024 brugte millioner af kroner på syntetisk brændstof til resten af Formel 1-flåden.

Her i blandt lastbiler. Helt konkret skriver McLaren, der sidste år blev solgt til Abu Dhabi, at man sidste år købte Sustainable Aviation Fuel-certificeret brændstof for 29 millioner kroner.

Det svarer til 3,8 millioner liter. En mængde brændstof som McLaren har kunnet køre hele sin flåde af lastbiler, og dele af mærkets flyfragt, på det syntetiske brændstof.

SAF-brændstof fremstilles af affald eller fornybare kilder og kan reducere udledningen med op til 90 procent sammenlignet med almindeligt jetbrændstof, skriver Formel 1-holdet.

Når det så er sagt, stopper McLaren ikke ved brændstoffet. Ifølge bæredygtighedsrapporten er holdet oppe på nu at have genbrugt 37 procent af materialerne fra sidste års Formel 1-bil, McLaren MCL38, bliver genbrugt.

På den anden side er det ikke alt, er det ikke alt, der er røde roser i McLaren-garagen. Holdet riskerer nemlig at stå med en ekstremt stor udgift til det syntetiske brændstof lige om lidt.

That is why we are actively positioning ourselves in China and working towards establishing a presence in India.
Ahmad Sabirin said Sirim is accelerating its global expansion by establishing more international offices, with the broader objective of enabling not only its own growth but also supporting the internationalisation of Malaysian small and medium enterprises.
Asked about examples of Sirim’s research and development initiatives in the electric vehicle space, Ahmad Sabirin said, “For EV, we have the most complex system for the industries.
Currently, much of the industrial focus is centred on advancing the EV sector,“ Ahmad Sabirin said.","LANGKAWI: Sirim Bhd aims to certify 50,000 domestic companies over the next two to three years – more than double the 20,000 local firms it supported last year – as part of its broader strategy to help Malaysian businesses expand globally, with a particular focus on tapping into the vast growth and revenue opportunities in India and China.

President and group CEO Datuk Dr Ahmad Sabirin Arshad said, “We are placing strong strategic focus on two of the world’s most populous and dynamic markets – China and India. Together, these nations represent nearly three billion people, accounting for a significant portion of the global population.

“Referred to symbolically as the ‘dragon’ and the ‘elephant’, missing out on these markets would be a substantial lost opportunity. That is why we are actively positioning ourselves in China and working towards establishing a presence in India.

“Additionally, as a multiracial nation with strong Chinese and Indian communities, Malaysia is uniquely positioned to leverage this diversity as a bridge into these ecosystems,” Ahmad Sabirin told SunBiz at the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition (Lima 2025) yesterday.

Ahmad Sabirin said Sirim is accelerating its global expansion by establishing more international offices, with the broader objective of enabling not only its own growth but also supporting the internationalisation of Malaysian small and medium enterprises.

Given the limitations of Malaysia’s relatively small market, Sirim is also strategically targeting the broader Asean region – with its population of about 680 million and substantial consumer base – as a key market, he said.

Touching on the aerospace sector, Ahmad Sabirin said as Malaysia assumes the Asean chairmanship this year, efforts are under way to position local aerospace players for regional growth, with a vision to expand beyond domestic government contracts and establish the country as a key aerospace hub in Southeast Asia – an ambition supported by ongoing collaboration between agencies such as Sirim, the Defence Ministry and regional investment partners.

“This year, Sirim is advancing its commitment to standard and technology diplomacy by extending its services to Asean member countries, including several least developed nations. Acknowledging the disparities within the region, Sirim aims to foster a more inclusive and vibrant ecosystem, with Malaysia taking a leadership role.

“Sirim hopes this initiative will align with the prime minister’s efforts to champion regional cooperation in technology, standards, and human capital development.

“In line with global sustainability goals, Sirim continues to position itself as a key enabler in Malaysia’s net zero ambitions –particularly through its long-standing work in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),” Ahmad Sabirin said.

He added that Sirim is in discussions with Petroliam Nasional Bhd to explore the potential of utilising locally sourced biomass for the production of SAF, recognising its critical role in advancing Malaysia’s net-zero carbon by 2050 goal.

With an emphasis on increasing SAF adoption across sectors, including national defence, this initiative positions Malaysia as a potential pioneer in the global SAF framework, leveraging its readily available and cost-effective raw materials to support both domestic use and international supply.

“Currently, we are purchasing SAF at a higher cost. However, by shifting processing capabilities to our own country, we can export higher-value products instead of importing them, ultimately improving our trade balance through more strategic value-added production and exports,” Ahmad Sabirin said.

Last year, Plantation and Commodities Minister Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani said Malaysia planned to start producing SAF in 2027, with an initial production capacity of one million tonnes per year.

The production capacity will gradually increase based on factory output and feedstock availability, the minister told parliament.

Malaysia, the world’s second-largest palm oil producer, is in a strategic position to become one of the world’s leading SAF producers, he was quoted saying in a Reuters report.

In April of this year, Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad said Malaysia was set to boost its role in the global clean energy sector with the development of a world-scale SAF refinery.

The project is a result of a strategic partnership between Bin Zayed International and local biofuel pioneer FatHopes Energy.

Describing the partnership as a “game-changer” for the country’s energy and aviation sectors, Nik Nazmi said this investment would serve as a catalyst for far-reaching transformation.

“It heralds Malaysia’s arrival as a serious player in the global clean energy and low-carbon economy,“ he said at the project’s memorandum of understanding signing ceremony.

Asked about examples of Sirim’s research and development initiatives in the electric vehicle space, Ahmad Sabirin said, “For EV, we have the most complex system for the industries. Before implementing an EV system in Malaysia, patent approval is required, and it must be validated by the country’s designated petroleum and energy research institute.

“Following patent approval, all EV systems must undergo testing and certification by Sirim QAS, while battery development and testing are handled by Sirim Research – forming a comprehensive ecosystem to support national battery innovation.

“In parallel, Sirim is actively developing standards for hydrogen, particularly as several states begin hydrogen-related initiatives.

“Ensuring safety remains a top priority, with clear standards and consistent compliance frameworks being established to guide industry practices. Currently, much of the industrial focus is centred on advancing the EV sector,“ Ahmad Sabirin said.",https://thesun.my/binrepository/480x373/0c62/480d250/none/11808/VDEC/ahmad-sabirin-za_5235551_20250523174308.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 12:56:21.133573

“We need volume as with volume comes efficiency. Then we can sustainably produce the outputs I mentioned earlier.

“Only then can we create a green agricultural sector – non-polluting and well-managed.

“This will benefit all mills. If one place produces two tonnes, another three tonnes, it’s not enough.

“But if we combine them, it can reach 100 tonnes, which is an efficient volume to produce the desired outputs,” he said.

Over his impressive career, Thomson has been a key player in the establishment of the Canadian renewable fuels industry.
One of his many career highlights was establishing the BC Biodiesel Association (2005) and the Alberta Biodiesel Association (2006).
“These two entities led industry development in Western Canada, eventually becoming the Western Canada Biodiesel Association in 2014.
In 2015, the scope of representation expanded, and the association became Advanced Biofuels Canada Association (ABFC).","There are few people whose names are more synonymous with biofuels in Canada than Ian Thomson. Just ask Fred Ghatala, president of Advanced Biofuels Canada.

“Ian is a pioneer leader in the development of Canada’s renewable and low carbon fuel sector,” he said.

Ghatala cites Thomson’s dedication to the industry since 2002, when he first focused on the potential use of biodiesel for reducing emissions from diesel fuel engines.

“In 2002, I started looking at fuels and alternatives and zeroed in on biodiesel as something that had potential, but nobody was really doing anything with it in Western Canada,” Thomson said.

Over his impressive career, Thomson has been a key player in the establishment of the Canadian renewable fuels industry. One of his many career highlights was establishing the BC Biodiesel Association (2005) and the Alberta Biodiesel Association (2006).

“These two entities led industry development in Western Canada, eventually becoming the Western Canada Biodiesel Association in 2014. In 2015, the scope of representation expanded, and the association became Advanced Biofuels Canada Association (ABFC). ABFC is Canada’s leading renewable fuels industry organization, promoting the production and use of sustainable, low carbon fuel alternatives to gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels,” Ghatala said.

Thomson served as president of the association from 2005 to 2024, stepping aside in 2025 to serve as past-president to assist the new executive team.

In 2005, Thomson co-founded the Canadian Bioenergy Corporation (CBEC), the first biodiesel distribution business in B.C. Ghatala said the company “quickly grew from importing 1,000 litres totes of U.S.-made biodiesel to establishing tankage at terminals in North Vancouver and Calgary, and shipping railcars as far east as Nova Scotia.”

While serving as president of CBEC, Thomson also worked on the Canadian biodiesel sector’s testing and standards work with the Canadian General Standards Board.

“The first quality standards for biodiesel and biodiesel blends were finalized around 2011, which were key to providing functional fuel assurance,” Ghatala said.

That same year, Thomson and his partners shut down CBEC to co-found Waterfall Advisors Group, which staffs ABFC’s operations and serves the Canadian biofuels sector with consulting expertise and coast-to-coast coverage.

Between 2010 and 2012, Thomson led the industry associations in assisting governments with adopting the first diesel fuel RFS blending regulations in B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and federally with the Canadian Renewable Fuel Regulations.

“In 2013, B.C. finally implemented its ground-breaking Low Carbon Fuel Standard; and Ontario followed with its hybrid (RFS/LCFS) Greener Diesel Regulation in 2014,” Ghatala notes.

Thomson has also played a key role in helping develop what eventually became Archer Daniels Midland’s biodiesel project, which commissioned Canada’s largest biodiesel facility (320MLY) in Lloydminster, AB. in October 2013.

“At that point we had enough demand, we reckoned, to build a plant. So, with a small group of other colleagues, put together a company that eventually co-adventured with a large global agribusiness company to build the Lloydminster biodiesel plant run by Archer Daniels Midland,” Thomson recalled.

Over the next 12 years, Thomson continued to lead the way in the growth of the renewable fuels sector with milestones such as:

Assisting with the six-year regulatory development phase of the Clean Fuel Regulations that were finalized in June 2022, and became effective July 1, 2023;

Helping develop the first low carbon fuel regulations in Quebec (2023); and B.C.’s new LCFS statute and regulation (2024); which is Canada’s most stringent fuel regulation, and includes the first SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) mandate in the Americas.

“The regulations referred to above were ground-breaking achievements in Canada, and, over 2010 to 2024, they have proven to be the most successful mechanism to reduce GHGs from fossil fuel use in transportation,” Ghatala said.

Thomson gives kudos to his colleagues of two decades including dedicated and deeply knowledgeable association staff. He also flags the indispensable work of provincial governments, especially B.C., Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, and Quebec, and the federal government for helping create a friendlier environment.

“The provinces have taken real leadership in getting regulations that give the kind of assurances that people who have capital and aspirations to build production assets need,” Thomson said. “The federal government undertaking the Clean Fuels Regulations starting in 2016, and wrapping up in 2022, was great work. It took longer than we had hoped, and ended up coming full circle back to a pretty basic local carbon fuel standard, but that was a real highlight.”

Seeing the clean fuel sectors collaborating recently has also been a highlight.

“It’s way too easy for people in the alternative fuel space to feel like they have to compete with each other,” he said. “I mean, at the end of the day, they compete. But first you’ve got to collaborate to get a market, and I think we’ve seen some really effective collaborations in Canada.”

When asked what advice he would offer the next generation looking to become active in the renewable fuels sector, Thomson says to be prepared for two steps forward and one-and-a-half steps back.

“I talk with people who are graduating from engineering programs or getting into them, or wanting to get into this space, and they think everything’s going to go hydrogen. They think everything is going to go electrification,” he said. “The view that many of us in the clean fuels space have is there’s going to be a long road for high energy density, low carbon liquid fuels. Whether those are fossil fuels with significantly lower their carbon emissions, biofuels produced out of refineries with co-processing or renewable diesel, or biofuels produced in standalone biofuel plants with low carbon intensity increasingly made from a wider range of feedstocks than just agricultural crops, the need to fuel internal combustion engines is going to be around for a long time.” •",https://www.canadianbiomassmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lifetime-Achievement-Awards-Ian-Thomson.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 11:56:51.032490

Honeywell International has agreed to purchase Johnson Matthey’s catalyst technologies business for about $2.3 billion. It plans to combine the business with its UOP subsidiary to create a chemical process engineering and catalysis giant.

Johnson Matthey’s catalyst business generated $930 million in sales during the company’s most recent fiscal year. The business specializes in processes related to synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and is a leading provider of technology for making syngas-derived products such as ammonia, methanol, and formaldehyde.

In recent years, the UK-based firm has been applying its know-how to low-carbon chemical production. For instance, it says its autothermal reforming technology for making hydrogen from natural gas can be easily integrated with carbon capture and storage.

Honeywell’s UOP unit had 2024 sales of about $2.6 billion from processes and catalysts for refining and petrochemicals. UOP has a particularly strong position in aromatics and derivatives. It is also active in olefins with its Oleflex propane dehydrogenation technology. In recent years, UOP has added sustainable chemistry technology, such as the Ecofining process it developed with Italian energy company Eni. Ecofining makes diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from waste fats and oils.

Last November, UOP and Johnson Matthey signed an agreement to join forces in Fischer-Tropsch and methanol routes to fuels from feedstocks such as municipal solid waste, residual biomass, and biogas.

“Acquiring Johnson Matthey's Catalyst Technologies business will provide our customers a comprehensive and cost-effective approach to transition their businesses to high-value products with lower emissions,"" says Ken West, president of Honeywell's Energy and Sustainability Solutions segment, in the company’s announcement of the deal.

Honeywell is in the middle of an ambitious portfolio transformation that includes spinning off its Aerospace Technologies and Advanced Materials businesses. The latter business, which generated $3.8 billion in sales in 2024, makes refrigerants and Spectra ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene fiber.

Johnson Matthey has been under pressure to streamline from major shareholder Standard Investments, an affiliate of Standard Industries, which owns the catalyst firm W. R. Grace. In December, Standard Investments called on Johnson Matthey to conduct a strategic review that could include the sale of all or part of itself. Standard didn’t respond to a request for comment on Johnson Matthey’s plan to sell the catalyst business.

With the sale of the catalyst technologies business to Honeywell, Johnson Matthey will be focused on its Clean Air business, which makes vehicle emissions catalysts, and platinum group metal services.

The sale price, Johnson Matthey CEO Liam Condon says in a statement, allows the company “to realise a very attractive valuation for this business that fully reflects its strong long-term growth prospects.”

Nearly 90% of the proceeds from the transaction will be paid out to shareholders. “We would expect a strong positive share price response,” says Jefferies stock analyst Charlie Bentley in a note to clients about the deal.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/Honeywell-buying-Johnson-Matthey-catalyst-technologies-business---86771?$responsive$&wid=700&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2",N,,2025-05-24 05:56:39.826537

Given China is Airbus' largest single-country market, it will strengthen local collaboration with suppliers to promote SAF use as a potential replacement for conventional jet fuel, which can achieve carbon reductions of around 80% over its life cycle using conventional jets.

Key Highlights:

Airbus supports China’s efforts to build a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry, citing the country’s strategic advantages.

China’s available feedstock could support SAF production of up to 12 million metric tons annually by 2030.

Airbus continues to deepen partnerships with China, expanding its A320 final assembly line in Tianjin.

Claire Kauffmann, Head of SAF and carbon dioxide removal at Airbus, added that China has useful advantages with plentiful feedstock, such as waste cooking oil and agricultural waste, rapidly-developing renewable energy infrastructure, and stable policy support. These drivers provide a good foundation for the sustainable aviation fuel industry to prosper in a sustainable way, she said.

The legislation adopts a series of amendments to the Texas Business Organizations Code (TBOC), which governs Texas corporations, limited liability companies, limited partnerships and other legal entities, that are designed to make Texas more attractive for entity formation and redomestication.

Senate Bill 29

On May 14, 2025, Governor Abbott signed Senate Bill 29 (S.B. 29) into law with immediate effect. The changes to the TBOC enacted by S.B. 29 clarify areas of existing Texas law and strengthen a company’s defenses against certain types of shareholder litigation.

Business Judgment Rule Statute

S.B. 29 enacts new Section 21.419 codifying the “business judgment rule” presumption. The statute applies automatically to public corporations (any corporation with a class or series of voting shares listed on a national securities exchange) and includes an option for any private corporation to “opt-in” by including an affirmative election in its governing documents.

Directors and officers of corporations that are subject to the statute are presumed to have acted (1) in good faith; (2) on an informed basis; (3) in furtherance of the interests of the corporation; and (4) in obedience to the law and the corporation’s governing documents, in taking or declining to take any action on any matters of the corporation’s business.

Further, the statute provides that neither the corporation nor any of its shareholders has a cause of action against a director or officer as a result of any act or omission in the person’s capacity as a director or officer unless (1) the claimant rebuts one or more of the codified presumptions and (2) it is proven by the claimant that (A) the director’s or officer’s act or omission constituted a breach of the person’s duties as a director or officer and (B) the breach involved fraud, intentional misconduct, an ultra vires act or a knowing violation of law.

Advance Independence Determination

S.B. 29 also overhauls provisions of the TBOC relevant to the evaluation and approval of certain conflict of interest transactions.

Specifically, the new legislation expressly empowers a board of directors of a public corporation or a private corporation that has opted-in to the business judgment rule statute (new Section 21.419) to form a committee of independent and disinterested directors to review and approve transactions involving the corporation or any of its subsidiaries and a controlling shareholder, director or officer, and to petition the Texas Business Court (or the district court in the county in which the corporation’s principal place of business in Texas is located, if that county is not located within an operating division of the Texas Business Court), to seek an advance determination as to whether the directors on the committee are independent and disinterested.

The court’s determination in such a proceeding is dispositive in the absence of evidence not presented to the court that one or more of the directors is not independent and disinterested with respect to a particular transaction involving the corporation or any of its subsidiaries and a controlling shareholder, director or officer.

Minimum Ownership Threshold for Derivative Actions

S.B. 29 allows public corporations and private corporations that have opted-in to the business judgment rule statute and have 500 or more shareholders (at the time the derivative proceeding is instituted) to proscribe, in the corporation’s certificate of formation or bylaws, a minimum ownership threshold for shareholders that are eligible to bring a derivative lawsuit, provided that such minimum ownership threshold does not exceed three percent of the corporation’s outstanding shares.

Limitation of Books and Records Demands

For public corporations and private corporations that have opted-in to the business judgment rule statute, S.B. 29 provides that a shareholder is not entitled to bring a books and records demand if it is reasonably determined by the corporation that the demand is in connection with (1) an active or pending derivative proceeding in the right of the corporation that is or is expected to be instituted or maintained by the holder or the holder’s affiliate or (2) an active or pending civil lawsuit to which the corporation or its affiliate and the holder or the holder’s affiliate are or are expected to be adversarial.

S.B. 29 also clarifies that, for all Texas corporations, “e-mails, text messages or similar electronic communications, or information from social media accounts” are not records that may be subject to a books and records demand, unless the particular communication effectuates action by the corporation.

Limiting Recovery of Attorney’s Fees in “Disclosure Only” Settlements

Under existing provisions of the TBOC, a court may order a corporation to reimburse a plaintiff’s attorney’s fees and other litigation costs incurred in a derivative proceeding if it is determined that the proceeding has resulted in a “substantial benefit” to the corporation. Under S.B. 29, the provision is amended to provide that additional or amended disclosures made to the shareholders, regardless of materiality, are not a “substantial benefit” to the corporation.

Waiver of Jury Trial

S.B. 29 codifies the right of a Texas entity to contain in its governing documents a provision waiving the right to a jury trial concerning any “internal entity claim,” which is a claim of any nature, including a derivative claim, that is based on, arises from, or relates to the internal affairs of the entity.

Exclusive Forum Selection

S.B. 29 also codifies the right of a Texas entity to contain in its governing documents a provision stipulating one or more courts in Texas as the exclusive forum and venue for “internal entity claims.”

Class and Series Voting Rights

S.B. 29 eliminates certain mandatory separate class and series voting requirements, providing greater flexibility for a Texas corporation to structure its voting rights among different classes and series of stock. The amendment addresses one of the more significant hurdles that corporations seeking to redomicile in Texas have historically encountered, as the rigidity of the prior regime was often incompatible with the way voting rights are typically structured in certain types of corporations with multiple classes or series of stock.

Limited Liability Companies and Limited Partnerships

While S.B. 29 will have the greatest impact on Texas corporations, the legislation also includes a number of analogous reforms for Texas limited liability companies and limited partnerships.

Senate Bill 1057

Senate Bill 1057 (S.B. 1057) was signed by Governor Abott on May 19, 2025, and will become effective on September 1, 2025. While not as expansive as S.B. 29, S.B. 1057 allows public companies with a specific nexus to Texas, either due to the location of its principal office or its decision to list its shares on one of the new Texas-based stock exchanges, the ability to “opt-in” to a statute that applies minimum ownership requirements to shareholder proposals.

A Texas corporation is eligible to opt-in to the statute by adopting an amendment to its governing documents if it (1) has a class of equity securities registered under Section 12(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (2) is admitted to listing on a national securities exchange; and (3) either (A) has its principal office in Texas or (B) is admitted to listing on a Texas-based stock exchange.

Once a corporation has opted-in, in order to be eligible to submit a proposal on a matter to the shareholders for approval, a shareholder or group of shareholders must (1) hold an amount of voting shares of the corporation equal to at least (A) $1 million in market value or (B) three percent of the corporation’s outstanding voting shares; (2) hold the shares for a continuous period of at least six months before the date of the meeting and throughout the duration of the meeting; and (3) solicit the holders of shares representing at least 67 percent of the voting power of shares entitled to vote on the proposal.

Summary

The changes implemented by S.B. 29 and S.B. 1057 represent a significant evolution in Texas corporate law. We expect the changes will promote new entity formation in Texas and will influence many companies organized in Delaware and other jurisdictions to consider a move to Texas. We also expect many existing Texas companies to adopt amendments to their governing documents to take advantage of various features of the new legislation.

“We are thrilled to welcome Green Fuels to Acadia Parish, and we’re excited that their arrival will bring good-paying jobs for our residents,” Acadia Police Jury President Beau Petitjean said.","State and regional officials confirmed earlier reports and offered new details regarding a net-zero emissions refinery that will be built in Acadia Parish, but indicated the project will employ fewer than what was initially reported.

Officials with the Louisiana Economic Development office announced the deal Friday morning with Oklahoma-based Green Fuels Operating PC that will occupy the former Evangeline Processing Facility along the Mermentau River in the southwest part of the parish.

The company will invest $110 million to transform the facility into a net-zero emissions facility and employ 60 with an average salary of $80,000.

An announcement from Clean Refineries Inc., which claims GFO as an operating subsidiary, last week indicated the plant would employ 160 and have an average salary of more than $105,000.

GFO handles the company’s daily operations at specific sites and will be over the Acadia site, a company spokesperson said. The $110 million price tag is only part of what is planned for south Louisiana, the spokesperson said.

It has a $1 billion commitment to building net-zero emissions refining facilities throughout the state.

“This project is a major first step in a much bigger effort,” Green Fuels Operating spokesperson Madison Beam said.

The company plans to develop a 20,000 barrel-per-day refining unit dedicated to producing marine-grade diesel and bunker fuel, state officials said. The existing facility has 15 storage tanks that have a capacity to exceed 350,000 barrels and will remain operational while the new GFO refining unit is developed.

It plans to upgrade the facility to support the production of sustainable marine fuels and house a full-scale waste and brine water treatment system, company officials said. It will also source local crude to support regional producers alongside feedstock delivered via pipeline and barge.

Construction is expected to begin in November and be complete in May 2026.

“We are thrilled to welcome Green Fuels to Acadia Parish, and we’re excited that their arrival will bring good-paying jobs for our residents,” Acadia Police Jury President Beau Petitjean said. “This facility has a long history in Acadia Parish, and seeing new investment in a legacy industrial refinery is a testament to the strength of our community and the potential for new development.”

The company received a competitive incentive project from LED, including the comprehensive workforce development solutions of LED FastStart. The company is also expected to participate in the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption and Quality Jobs programs.

“Under Louisiana’s ‘all of the above’ energy strategy, it is critical that we keep pace with the changing needs of the industry, including reopening and reenergizing legacy operations like Canal Companies with technology-driven strategies,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said.

In December Green Fuels Operating announced a similar refinery project in northern Oklahoma that will make jet fuel and farm-grade diesel that will be able to bought on site, reports indicate. That facility is expected to employ 30-35.

The company says its net-zero emission technology system is revolutionizing oil refining with its odor-free clean refining technology to become a world leader in low-cost, environmentally responsible hydrocarbon processing solutions.

GFO facilities produce locally needed supplies of sustainable fuels, including diesel, jet fuel, sustainable aviation fuel, marine-grade bunker fuels, road and roof asphalt binders.

“America's energy independence requires more than just drilling,” GFO CEO Derek Wiliamson said. “It demands that we refine our own oil here at home rather than shipping it overseas only to buy back finished fuels at premium prices.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/e6/1e678e79-80bf-5ebe-8a6c-2a54fd543a74/6435701dc8413.image.jpg?crop=1776%2C932%2C0%2C116&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-05-24 05:56:48.635872

The business jet market entered 2024 with demand finally matching the calmer rhythm typical before 2020, yet orderbooks remain anything but sluggish. According to GAMA’s February 2024 shipment report, OEMs delivered 730 aircraft in 2023 and have penciled in 755 deliveries for 2024, supported by a backlog of roughly 3 100 jets—its highest level in nearly a decade. Corporate operators that delayed upgrades during the pandemic are now executing multi-year replacement schedules, particularly for aircraft manufactured between 2003 and 2009 whose maintenance costs ballooned once flight activity rebounded in 2021-2023. ARGUS TraqPak data underscore this shift: flight hours for jets older than fifteen years fell by 210 000 cycles in 2023, while hours on aircraft younger than five years climbed steadily. In the business jet market, that behavioral change signals a sustained pull for newer models, even though overall utilization growth has leveled.

OEM production lines are adjusting accordingly. Bombardier moved Global 5500 final assembly to its modernized Toronto facility, unlocking slots for more Global 8000 units. Embraer’s São José dos Campos plant, already running two shifts, has added a dedicated Phenom 100EV line to capitalize on entry-level demand. Meanwhile, Gulfstream is maintaining G400 certification timing by reallocating engineers from the nearly complete G800 program. Such realignments reveal an industry prioritizing throughput without overheating. By creating delivery positions in the 2026-2027 window, manufacturers are meeting fleet-renewal needs while insulating the business jet market from the boom-and-bust cycles that characterized earlier decades.

Ultra-Long-Range Jets Dominate Backlogs, Challenging Traditional Large-Cabin Leaders Across OEMs

A granular look at business jet market orderbooks shows that ultra-long-range models—those capable of 7,000 nautical miles or more—capture the lion’s share of fresh commitments in the business jet market. Gulfstream’s G700 accounts for nearly 580 firm orders, Bombardier’s Global 8000 has crossed the 300-order mark since its 2022 launch, and Dassault records 132 Falcon 10X positions ahead of first flight. These figures eclipse the combined backlog for traditional large-cabin types such as the G500/600 and Falcon 8X. The narrative is being driven by multinational firms seeking nonstop links between second-tier financial centers: think Los Angeles–Riyadh or Singapore–San José.

Equally significant, performance extras are no longer the sole differentiator. Cabin cross-sections above eight feet, lower 4,000-foot-equivalent pressurization, and certified altitude ceilings of 51,000 feet are proving decisive in purchase committees. In the business jet market, passengers care less about shaving ten minutes off flight time and more about arriving rested and connected. OEMs are therefore embedding dual-band Ka-satcom antennas, predictive maintenance gateways, and inflight humidification systems as baseline, not optional. The success of this segment is reshaping portfolio strategies: Textron Aviation has shelved studies for a Citation Longitude+ and is instead evaluating an all-new platform to stretch beyond 6 500 nautical miles. Meanwhile, engine makers Rolls-Royce and GE Honda Aero are accelerating next-generation core demonstrators aimed squarely at 20,000-pound-thrust applications, underscoring how the ultra-long-range wave is redirecting R&D dollars across the entire market landscape.

Corporate Sustainability Pivots Investment Toward SAF-Compatible Engine Platforms In Fleets

Environmental scrutiny is reshaping board-level aviation policies faster than any regulation. By March 2024, 27 U.S. airports consistently supplied sustainable aviation fuel, while total global SAF deliveries to business aviation reached 300 million liters, reports the Air Transport Action Group. Multinational corporations such as Microsoft, Gucci, and Siemens have begun contractually mandating that charter providers document SAF uplift per mission. Consequently, fleet managers assessing new purchases now give ample weight to fuel-burn baselines and feedstock compatibility. In the business jet market, that tilt has dramatically favored platforms powered by Rolls-Royce Pearl and Pratt & Whitney PW800 series engines, both certified for 100% SAF blends.

Concrete investment follows principle in the business jet market. Three Fortune 100 companies placed launch orders for Bombardier’s EcoJet technology demonstrator after the Canadian OEM disclosed wind-tunnel data showing a 20-meter span blended-wing body and laminar flow savings of about 1 000 pounds of fuel on a 4 000-nautical-mile leg. At the operational level, the market logged 14 500 book-and-claim SAF transactions in 2023—triple the 2021 tally and a figure already surpassed in the first four months of 2024. The market is also exploring electric taxi systems and lightweight cabin materials: F/LIST delivered 60 ship-sets of bio-resin sidewalls to two OEMs this year, demonstrating that sustainability influences not only propulsion but every specification line item. For decision-makers, the message is unambiguous—decarbonization is no longer peripheral; it is a central filter guiding purchase approvals and residual-value expectations in the evolving business jet market.

Pre-Owned Inventory Rebounds, Reshaping Pricing And OEM Production Strategies Today

After historic scarcity in 2022, the pre-owned channel is swinging back toward equilibrium in the business jet market. JetNet iQ’s Q4 2024 briefing lists 1,098 business jets actively for sale, up from 730 a year ago yet still below the 1,600 listings considered “normal” prior to 2020. Average aircraft age on market—17.4 years—and time to sell—198 days—provide granular clues to buyer sentiment: value shoppers remain disciplined, but any aircraft with deferred maintenance languishes. This incremental supply has moderated ask prices, which settled at a median $13.2 million by April 2024. That transparent correction is welcome news for corporate flight departments budgeting replacements.

OEMs are monitoring every uptick. Gulfstream dialed back G650ER production from 36 to 28 units for 2024 to avoid overlap with gently-used 2018 airframes returning from private equity owners. Textron Aviation, by contrast, saw improving Citation Latitude residuals as a green light to add seven additional white-tail slots. Such nimble responses underscore a broader truth in the business jet market: the health of the pre-owned segment directly governs factory cadence. In the market, stakeholders now treat inventory metrics with the same gravity once reserved for macro-economic indicators. Brokers expect listings to approach 1 300 jets by year-end, but they also predict more first-time owners drawn by improved choice and transparent maintenance records thanks to digital logbooks. Thus, resurgent pre-owned supply is not a harbinger of downturn; rather, it is a pressure-relief valve keeping the market balanced and credible.

Regional Hotspots Show Divergent Growth Drivers And Delivery Profiles Patterns

Region-specific data illuminate why a single global narrative rarely suffices. North America maintained its traditional lead in the business jet market with 430 deliveries in 2023, fueled by strong corporate profits and the convenience of 5 000 paved runways suitable for jets. Europe followed with 160 units, though sanctions-related airspace constraints over Russia altered routing patterns and nudged some owners toward longer-range types. Asia-Pacific recorded 72 deliveries, with India absorbing 18 of them—its highest intake on record—as family-owned conglomerates upgraded to midsize cabins to reach Africa nonstop. Meanwhile, the Middle East and North Africa accepted 40 aircraft, boosted by sovereign funds demanding ultra-long-range models for travel to the Americas. Latin America rounded out the tally with 28 deliveries, where Mexico’s fractional start-ups ordered Phenom 100EVs to serve high-elevation strips.

These granular figures reveal distinct purchase rationales in the business jet market. Whereas U.S. buyers in the market emphasize dispatch reliability, European owners increasingly highlight emissions compliance under the EU ETS cap. In Asia-Pacific, availability of skilled crews is paramount; operators spent the first quarter of 2024 recruiting 250 additional pilots, many from commercial airlines retrenching capacity. The Middle Eastern market, by contrast, measures value through bespoke cabin finishes and quick-change medevac kits. For stakeholders, acknowledging these disparate drivers is essential when forecasting opportunities or deciding where to allocate maintenance bases. A one-size-fits-all strategy no longer suffices; rather, the business jet market requires region-tuned offerings, financing terms, and support infrastructures to capture latent demand and ensure enduring customer satisfaction.

Digitalization And Cabin Connectivity Emerge As Prime Differentiators For Buyers

In 2024, connectivity has advanced from amenity to prerequisite in the business jet market. Inmarsat counts 4,500 active Jet ConneX Ka-band terminals, up 600 units year on year, while Gogo reports 1,375 Avance L5 installations. Corporate travelers treat uninterrupted video conferencing as non-negotiable; thus, aircraft lacking dual-provider redundancy face longer selling cycles. Equally transformative is predictive maintenance. Dassault’s FalconScan and Gulfstream’s PlaneConnect Fleet are now logging more than 18 terabytes of aircraft-health data every week. These streams feed digital twins that forecast component lifetimes down to singular flight legs, cutting unscheduled events. In the business jet market, such dependability translates directly into retained value and higher dispatch rates.

Cabin interfaces follow suit. Touchless controls, OLED lighting zones, and AI-assisted voice commands powered by Collins’ Venue CMS upgrade packages are penetrating retrofit programs. Moreover, cloud-based weight-and-balance apps and Bluetooth-enabled e-tasters for baggage compartments shorten pre-flight checks, enhancing operational efficiency. The uptick in digital sophistication is not purely technical; it is commercial. Financing agreements now routinely stipulate that borrowers keep flight-data-monitoring subscriptions active, allowing lessors real-time insight into asset utilization. Put simply, the business jet market treats connectivity and data transparency as baseline value propositions that influence charter rates, residual curves, and even insurance premiums. Decision makers ignoring this shift risk fielding aircraft perceived as technologically dated well before their airframe hours suggest obsolescence.

Supply Chain Constraints Easing, But Skilled Labor Gaps Remain Persistent

Parts shortages that hampered 2022 production have largely moderated. Honeywell reduced average lead times for TFE731 turbine blades to 210 days, down from 265, while Spirit AeroSystems cleared its 1,800-unit backlog of G500/600 fuselage barrels. Nevertheless, the business jet market still contends with labor bottlenecks. NBAA’s 2024 workforce study shows 13 000 open positions for A&P technicians across North America, and Embraer’s executive-jet division cites mechanic vacancies as the sole factor limiting Phenom output. OEMs are responding with apprenticeship partnerships at Wichita State, Savannah Technical College, and École Nationale de l’Aviation Civile, collectively training 1 200 students this year.

Materials availability is another nuance. Toray’s carbon-fiber allocation for private-airframe customers is stable, yet Grade-5 titanium forgings used in wing spars remain scarce, forcing Dassault to re-sequence Falcon 10X build blocks. At the same time, avionics suppliers are normalizing chip inventories: Garmin now guarantees 16-week delivery for G3000 processors, aiding on-time completions at Eclipse and HondaJet. Still, risk lurks in concentrated sub-tier vendors; a fire at a single resin plant in March 2024 briefly halted cabin floorboard production across three OEMs. Thus, vigilance is critical. Stakeholders must strengthen dual-sourcing, invest in additive manufacturing, and, most of all, attract and retain skilled labor. Only through such holistic resilience can the business jet market transition from reactive production adjustments to a sustainable cadence that meets customer expectations without compromising quality.

Leasing And Fractional Ownership Expand Access, Redefining Utilization Metrics Globally

Leasing and fractional models are rewriting the rulebook on ownership economics. NetJets operates a fleet that surpassed 1 000 aircraft in January 2024, while Flexjet’s tally stands at 270, both posting record-high flight schedules. VistaJet reported 220 000 program hours flown in 2023 and is on pace to exceed that by mid-November 2024. Ascend by Cirium counts 280 business jets under operating lease worldwide, up from 190 in 2021, reflecting stronger appetite among banks and alternative lenders. These structures offer capital-light entry points for companies hesitant to place full purchase orders yet unwilling to depend on ad-hoc charter.

Their impact ripples beyond financing. Fractional operators drive aircraft at least twice as intensively as corporate owners, pushing mid-life airframes into heavy checks sooner and thus generating MRO demand. High utilization also accelerates cabin refresh cycles, spurring interior-modification revenue streams. In the business jet market, the resulting data troves—hours flown, mission profiles, maintenance touchpoints—feed algorithms that refine residual-value forecasts and influence insurance underwriting. New entrants such as France’s OpenJet and Dubai’s JetLease also employ app-based booking platforms that integrate carbon calculators and slot-availability forecasts, satisfying the modern traveler’s craving for transparency. For decision makers, the lesson is clear: integrating leasing or fractional options into fleet strategy not only optimizes capital but also aligns with shifting expectations of flexibility, sustainability, and digital convenience that now define the forward-looking market.

The process can result in three end products — what Infinium calls eDiesel, eSAF, and eNaphtha — considered to be drop-in replacements for traditional products, with the product mix varying based on demand. Project Roadrunner will convert waste CO2 and use 150 MW of new wind generation capacity secured from a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources through a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA).

The fuels produced will be sold domestically in the U.S. and exported. Under an agreement with airline group IAG, the SAF will be shipped to the UK to satisfy compliance requirements under a recently enacted SAF mandate, which requires that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK be sourced from sustainable feedstocks by 2030.",,N,,2025-05-23 17:56:39.649762

From reducing emissions to promoting greener technologies, industry players must navigate complex regulations, funding constraints, and evolving customer expectations.

At the forefront of this transition is the International Air Cargo Association (TIACA), which spearheads initiatives to guide businesses—large and small—toward more sustainable operations. In this exclusive C-Suite interview, Glyn Hughes, TIACA’s Director General, shares his insights on the industry’s key challenges, the role of collaboration, and the concrete steps TIACA is taking to drive long-term sustainability in air cargo.

Leadership and innovation in sustainability For TIACA, sustainability is a broad commitment that extends beyond carbon emissions. Speaking about the TIACA BlueSky program, Hughes emphasises, “Each organisation should establish a strategy specific to their operation, encompassing environmental, waste, people, efficiency, and community aspects.” Designed to support businesses on their sustainability journey, the program assesses their current performance across key criteria. It provides a personalised dashboard with targeted insights, guiding organisations on areas for improvement.

Global collaboration for a greener future Sustainability in air cargo requires a collective effort, and TIACA has made partnerships a core part of its strategy. “TIACA very much focuses on collaboration and partnerships,” Hughes says. The organisation shares its Insights Report, Roadmap to Industry Sustainability, and other key resources across the industry. Additionally, TIACA works closely with ESG experts and hosts the annual TIACA Sustainability Awards to highlight innovative solutions driving environmental progress.

Navigating challenges in sustainable air cargo

Achieving sustainability goals is not without obstacles. “Information overload is as challenging as lack of information,” Hughes points out, noting that regulations such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates, CORSIA, EU ETS, CSRD, and ReFuelEU, create complexities for businesses, particularly smaller ones. “Carbon Offsetting is a good example,” Hughes shares. “Some smaller organisations would like to offset their emissions, either on a shipment level or for a complete business activity.” To help make that process simple, TIACA launched an Invest in Climate Action platform, enabling companies to purchase carbon credits and invest in sustainable projects in developing regions.

Projects making an impact

TIACA is actively leading several initiatives to make sustainability more accessible. “As mentioned, we have our annual Sustainability Survey, Industry Sustainability Roadmap, BlueSky assessment program, Climate Action platform, and a newly launched Training library which provides numerous ESG and general cargo training solutions,” Hughes outlines. These programs offer industry-wide assessments and targeted tools to help companies take concrete steps toward sustainability.

The future of sustainable air cargo Looking ahead, TIACA is aligning its efforts with global net-zero goals. “TIACA fully supports industry net-zero by 2050 targets. We also advocate for enhancing industry action in support of the United Nations 17 SDGs,” Hughes states. This includes pushing for greater investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production and the global accessibility of SAF technology.

Beyond SAF, alternative energy sources will also play a crucial role. “SAF will need to grow exponentially from the less than 1% we see today to about 65% of industry fuel usage to help achieve the net-zero target by 2050,” Hughes says. He also emphasises the importance of green hydrogen, electrification for ground transport, and AI-driven efficiency improvements in making air cargo operations more sustainable.

Tracking progress and measuring success TIACA’s sustainability surveys provide valuable insights into industry progress. “On the positive side, the industry has taken huge steps to reduce usage of single-use plastic, and has invested heavily in modern energy-efficient fleets of aircraft and ground vehicles,” Hughes shares. However, he also notes a growing gap: “We are seeing fragmentation with larger organisations having dedicated teams and strategies in place, while smaller organisations find it more of a challenge.”

Supporting smaller businesses Bridging this gap, TIACA is helping SMEs access tailored sustainability solutions. “The BlueSky program is the best vehicle as it allows a company to receive specific personalised dashboards highlighting what they are doing well and where they need to provide more attention,” Hughes explains. By providing SMEs with structured insights and resources, TIACA ensures that sustainability is not just for major players but for businesses of all sizes.

A vision for sustainable air cargo As the industry continues its journey toward sustainability, Hughes underscores the importance of a responsible and inclusive approach. “The role air cargo plays in supporting the global economy is crucial in enabling enhanced global prosperity for all. So, we must safeguard this industry by being responsible, good global citizens,” he says. Beyond environmental impact, sustainability must also address social factors, creating opportunities for all, “regardless of gender, religion, academic background, or physical abilities.”

The power of collective action For Hughes, collective action is not just beneficial—it’s essential. “Sustainability is increasingly becoming a key enabler of business with partners, customers, employees, regulators, and financial institutions demanding action. We should all therefore do what we can,” he urges. He stresses that the industry’s collective efforts will not only drive meaningful change but also help demonstrate to regulators that air cargo is capable of managing its own sustainability journey, potentially reducing the need for additional regulation.

As TIACA continues to lead the charge in sustainability, its initiatives, partnerships, and strategic programs will play a critical role in shaping the air cargo industry’s greener future.

They revealed how the use of a different catalyst material can overcome issues with current Li-CO₂ batteries, making them more commercially viable and eco-friendly.

Li-CO₂ batteries are considered to be the next frontier energy-storage technology because of their ability to greatly outperform today’s lithium-ion batteries. They have a high energy density and reduce carbon emissions by absorbing CO2. But key challenges to making the batteries commercially viable include wearing out quickly, failing to recharge and relying on expensive rare materials such as platinum.

Recharging a Li-CO₂ battery requires breaking down lithium carbonate (Li₂CO₃), which is formed as part of the chemical reaction, to release lithium and CO₂.

“One of the biggest challenges with these batteries is something called ‘overpotential’ – the extra energy needed to get the reaction going. You can think of it like cycling uphill before you can coast,” explained Siddharth Gadkari, co-author of the study and lecturer in chemical process engineering.

To overcome this ‘overpotential’ requires printing the right catalyst material on the porous positive electrode. Yet these catalysts are typically made from expensive, rare metals.

The team found an alternative catalyst, caesium phosphomolybdate (CPM), which is low-cost and can be manufactured at room temperature.

To understand how CPM worked, the researchers dismantled the battery after charging and discharging to study the chemical changes inside. They found that Li₂CO₃ could be reliably built up and removed, essential for long-term use.

Computer modelling then revealed how CPM offered the ideal surface for key chemical reactions. The material was shown to make the battery stable for 107 cycles, while storing 2.5 times the amount of charge of a lithium-ion battery.

“What we’ve shown is that CPM flattens that hill, meaning the battery loses far less energy during each charge and discharge,” said Gadkari.

Daniel Commandeur, study co-author, said: “What’s exciting about this discovery is that it combines strong performance with simplicity.

“We’ve shown that it’s possible to build efficient lithium-CO₂ batteries using affordable, scalable materials – no rare metals required. Our findings also open the door to designing even better catalysts in the future.”

If commercialised, these batteries could help cut emissions from vehicles and industrial sources – and scientists even imagine they could operate on Mars, where the atmosphere is 95% CO₂.

The Surrey team will now conduct further research into how these catalysts interact with electrodes and electrolytes. They will also focus upcoming tests on evaluating how the battery performs under different CO₂ pressures.",https://eandt.theiet.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2025-05/web_battery-space-green-energy-charge-icon_Credit_Dima-Zel_shutterstock_1786180883_800x500.png?itok=QgPebtzL,N,,2025-05-23 17:56:49.912969

The integration of Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies is expected to not only expand the division’s technology offerings but also help global customers advance their decarbonization goals.","Honeywell has agreed to acquire Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies business in a strategic move that significantly strengthens its position in energy transition technologies. The all-cash transaction, valued at £1.8 billion, will integrate the UK-based catalyst and process technology provider into Honeywell’s Energy and Sustainability Solutions (ESS) segment.

The deal enhances Honeywell’s ability to serve the refining and petrochemical markets while enabling it, for the first time, to deliver a comprehensive suite of technologies for producing low-emission fuels. These include sustainable methanol, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), blue hydrogen, and blue ammonia — all central to energy security and decarbonization strategies worldwide.

“The acquisition of Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies business broadens Honeywell’s role as a world-class technology provider of critical energy needed to drive growth into the future,” said Vimal Kapur, Chairman and CEO of Honeywell. “As demand for diversified sources of energy continues accelerating, we will better enable Honeywell to offer the innovation our customers need.”

Complementary technology and expanded reach

Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies segment brings over 1,900 employees and a global footprint, with headquarters in London and operations across the U.S., Europe, and India. The business specializes in catalyst manufacturing and licensing of process technologies, directly complementing Honeywell’s UOP unit, which already supplies catalysts and process solutions to the refining and petrochemicals sectors.

By combining the two portfolios, Honeywell will expand its installed base and gain access to new, high-growth end markets. Customers will benefit from integrated offerings that span technology licensing, engineering, services, and catalyst supply — all designed to convert hydrocarbon and renewable feedstocks into valuable products with lower carbon intensity.

“As we continue to expand and evolve our ESS portfolio, acquiring Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies business will provide our customers a comprehensive and cost-effective approach to transition their businesses to high-value products with lower emissions,” said Ken West, President and CEO of Honeywell’s ESS segment.

Strategic realignment continues

The acquisition forms part of a broader transformation at Honeywell, which is repositioning its portfolio around three core growth areas: automation, aviation, and energy transition. Earlier this year, Honeywell announced plans to spin off its Aerospace Technologies and Advanced Materials businesses, creating three standalone public companies, each with focused strategies and markets.

Since December 2023, Honeywell has undertaken several major transactions to reshape its industrial portfolio. These include acquiring Civitanavi Systems, CAES Systems, the LNG business from Air Products, Sundyne, and Carrier Global’s Access Solutions division. Concurrently, the company has moved to divest its Personal Protective Equipment business, which is expected to close by mid-2025.

These transactions align with Honeywell’s capital deployment strategy and aim to drive organic growth, simplify operations, and strengthen the company’s core capabilities in technology and process automation.

Accelerating the energy transition

Honeywell’s growing ESS division has become a cornerstone of its push into cleaner, more efficient energy solutions. The integration of Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies is expected to not only expand the division’s technology offerings but also help global customers advance their decarbonization goals.

The combined portfolio will enable refiners and chemical producers to navigate stricter emissions regulations and shifting energy demand by providing a full set of tools for sustainable production. Technologies aimed at converting feedstocks to SAF, methanol, hydrogen, and ammonia are particularly attractive in light of rising demand for cleaner alternatives in aviation and industrial sectors.

The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2026.",https://www.compressortech2.com/Images/1260x628/index-20250523-144515-Johnson-Matthey.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 16:56:50.428470

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producer Neste has inked an agreement to supply FedEx with more than 3 million gallons of blended SAF for delivery at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

FedEx on May 20 said the fuel it purchased includes a minimum of 30% neat Neste MY SAF. As used in its blended form, the fuel will account for roughly one-fifth of all jet fuel consumed annually by FedEx at LAX, based on fiscal-year 2025 fuel forecasts, the package deliverer said. Neste’s SAF is made completely from renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste.

“Our aviation network represents the largest amount of FedEx fuel use globally and, as a result, is our biggest opportunity to drive down emissions,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, chief sustainability officer and vice president of environmental affairs at FedEx. “As we work toward our goal of carbon-neural operations by 2040, we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.”

Fuel delivery started earlier in May and is expected to continue throughout the next year, according to the news release.

Infinium Begins Construction of eFuels Facility in Texas

Efuels producer Infinium has started construction of its Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy-backed Project Roadrunner eFuels production site in Reeves County, Texas, near Pecos, according to a May 19 news release.

Chemically identical to conventional petroleum-based fuels, eFuels are made with waste CO2 and renewable energy.

The project will produce about 23,000 tonnes per year (7.6 million gallons) of synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other eFuel products when it becomes operational. That would make it the world’s largest eFuels production facility, according to the release.

“Infinium’s Project Roadrunner marks a huge achievement for the fuel industry,” said Infinium CEO Robert Schuetzle. “Not only will the project produce commercial eSAF for its customers, it will bring highly skilled jobs and economic growth to the Pecos community and state of Texas. This project demonstrates the ongoing commitment of Infinium, its investors and partners to help ensure that the United States remains a global leader in energy security, resilience and innovation.”

In related news, Electric Hydrogen announced May 19 its 100-megawatt (MW) HYPRPlant was selected for Project Roadrunner. Electric Hydrogen said its modular solution lowers hydrogen total installed project costs by up to 60% compared to other electrolyzer solutions.

The eFuels facility is expected to begin commercial e-fuels production in 2027.

E3 Lithium, Pure Lithium Progress Lithium Extraction, Battery Technology

Initial results of a study show lithium concentrate made by E3 Lithium can produce battery-ready lithium metal anodes using Pure Lithium’s technology, according to a May 22 news release.

As part of the study, E3 said several variations of its lithium chloride concentrate were used to make lithium metal anodes at Pure Lithium’s Boston facility. The lithium chloride was electrodeposited as pure lithium metal onto a copper substrate to create battery ready anodes, which were then assembled by Pure Lithium into batteries.

“The results of this study concluded that an easily producible version of E3’s lithium concentrate provided the most cost-effective feedstock for use in Pure Lithium’s batteries,” E3 said in the release. “It also demonstrated the robustness of Pure Lithium’s process, showing no performance differences between batteries made using lithium chloride from E3’s Leduc Brines, and those made from Pure Lithium’s standard sources.”

Results, according to the news release, showed the brine streams all achieved a very high purity level, greater than 99.9% pure lithium metal; and cells achieved over 500 cycles to date.

E3 said it continues to collaborate with Pure Lithium to develop and plan an integrated process capable of delivering the highest purity, lowest cost lithium metal anodes.

USGS: Geothermal Energy in Nevada’s Great Basin Could Play Larger Role

(Reuters) Geothermal energy in the Great Basin of Nevada and adjoining states could produce electricity equivalent to 10% of the current U.S. power supply, the U.S. Geological Survey said May 22.

The projected 10% would be a major increase, considering geothermal energy currently contributes less than 1% to the nation’s power supply, the agency said in a note.

“Provisional assessment shows potential for 135 gigawatts of baseload power—if current technology works at scale in Nevada and 5 adjoining states,” it noted.

Geothermal energy refers to heat generated within the Earth that can be harnessed for uses including heating, cooling and electricity generation.

With adequate technological advancements in coming years, the geothermal potential in the Great Basin is sufficient to fulfill a significant portion of the nation's electrical requirements, the agency added.

Following the assessment in the Great Basin, the next region to be evaluated will be the Williston Basin in North Dakota, according to the agency.

Deutsche ReGas Gets EU Funding for Lubmin Hydrogen Project

(Reuters) Deutsche ReGas on May 21 said it will receive 112 million euros (US$126.97 million) worth of public grants from the EU’s Hydrogen Bank for a renewable hydrogen project at Lubmin on Germany’s Baltic Sea coast.

The grant comes under EU funding schemes to promote electrolysis processes that use carbon-free electricity to kick-start a local economy producing hydrogen as an alternative to fossil fuels.

ReGas said the hydrogen production at Lubmin, for which the funding will be spread over 10 years, can cut 1.6 MMmt of CO2.

The EU subsidy is designed to help to close price differences between green hydrogen production costs and conventional energy prices.

The funding was awarded in a 992 million-euro auction, the second for the Hydrogen Bank, in which 15 projects from five countries were awarded money, ReGas said in a statement.

ReGas is a private developer and operator of energy infrastructure, including floating storage and regasification units and hydrogen electrolyzers.

The Lubmin plant, located near where ReGas used to import LNG on a floating reception terminal in the aftermath of the 2022 energy crisis, aims to make use of access to offshore wind energy and Baltic Sea water that can be used in the electrolysis process to make hydrogen. It is also close to both power transmission grids and a new hydrogen core transport network, set to start between 2025 and 2032.

AES, Meta Seal Deals for Solar Power

Power company AES Corp. on May 21 said it has entered two long-term power purchase agreements to supply Meta with electricity from 650 MW of solar projects in Texas and Kansas.

The electricity from AES’s power projects in the Southwest Power Pool market will help power Meta’s data centers, according to the news release. ""These solutions support our goal for 100% clean and renewable energy and will add new generation to the grid in these markets,” said Urvi Parekh, global head of energy for Meta.

The agreements lift AES’ contractual arrangements with major global hyperscalers to 10.1 gigawatts (GW), the company said.

“By providing energy solutions that offer fast time-to-power and low-cost electricity, we continue to be the partner of choice for companies, like Meta, at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation,” said AES President and CEO Andrés Gluski.

TotalEnergies Flips On Its Largest Solar Project in Europe

Paris-based oil major TotalEnergies has inaugurated a cluster of five solar projects in Seville, Spain, that together make the company’s largest solar field in Europe.

Combined, the solar projects have an installed capacity of 263 MW and the ability to produce 515 gigawatt hours per year of electricity, the company said May 22 in a news release. That is equivalent to the amount needed to power 150,000 households. The field has about 400,000 bifacial solar panels with trackers.

Olivier Jouny, senior vice President of renewables at TotalEnergies, said the project contributes to Spain’s goal of having renewables make up 80% of its energy mix by 2030. “With our 1,700 employees in Spain, we are building a competitive integrated power portfolio that combines renewables and flexible gas-fired power plants to deliver clean firm power to our customers,” Jouny said.

Most of the electricity produced will be sold via long-term power purchase agreements, and the rest sold on the wholesale market.

India’s Reliance to Start Solar Module Factory This Year, Exec Says

(Reuters) Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries will start its solar photovoltaic modules factory this year, a company executive said May 22.

“We are today building three bigger factories ... in order to produce clean energy requirements,” said Partha P. Maitra, president of strategy and initiatives at Reliance Industries.

India has been scrambling to meet its clean energy targets after falling short in 2022.

Over the past year, the country has ramped up investments in the sector, but needs to double capacity additions over the next five years to meet its target of 500-GW non-fossil power capacity by 2030, a Global Energy Monitor report showed.

Reliance aims to eventually scale up solar module capacity to 20 GW per year, Maitra said.

Its battery and micro power electronics factory will start next year, he said.

“If it happens we will be the no. 2 solar PV producer in the world. We will produce roughly 14% of total solar PV modules outside China,” the executive said.

Doral Renewables Secures $1.5B in Financing for Mammoth Solar Projects

Philadelphia-based Doral Renewables has closed on $1.5 billion of debt and tax equity financing for solar projects that are part of its 1.3-GW Mammoth Solar facility, the company said May 19.

The construction financing is for the Mammoth South, Mammoth Central I and Mammoth Central II projects, which each have a capacity of 300 MW and long-term power purchase agreements with utilities in place. Combined, the three solar projects—located in Indiana’s Pulaski County—will utilize more than 1 million U.S.-made solar panels, Doral said in the news release.

“We are thrilled to close these landmark financings in support of the construction of the remaining three phases of our Mammoth Solar project,” Doral Renewables CFO Evan Speece said.

KeyBanc Capital Markets, Banco Santander and HSBC Bank USA acted as coordinated lead arrangers for the $1.3 billion construction debt financing for the projects, which consisted of $412 million of construction-to-term loan facilities, $614 million of tax equity bridge loans and a $259 million letter of credit facility, according to the release

Doral also executed its first tax equity with Truist Bank, which made a more than $200-million tax equity commitment for Mammoth South.

Marathon Capital Markets served as the tax equity adviser, while McDermott Will & Emery provided legal counsel to Doral. CCA Group served as the tax equity adviser and Milbank LLP provided tax equity legal counsel to Truist. Norton Rose Fulbright provided legal counsel to the lenders, according to the release.

The three solar projects are scheduled to begin commercial operations in fourth-quarter 2026.

Wind

Equinor, Polenergia Agree on Polish Offshore Wind Project

(Reuters) Norway’s Equinor and Poland’s Polenergia made a final investment decision for the project to build two wind farms off the Polish coast of the Baltic Sea, the Warsaw-based company said May 19.

The two farms, each with a generation capacity of 720 MW are set to cost a total of about 6.4 billion euros (US$7.20 billion) and start generating power in 2027 and be completed in 2028.

Investors—including PGE, Orlen, Equinor and Ørsted—are developing 6 GW of offshore capacity along the Polish coast set to come online by 2030. Auctions for projects in the second round are planned for 2025.

Poland is boosting offshore potential in the Baltic Sea estimated to be as high as 33 GW, according to the Polish Wind Energy Association.

Denmark Plans Offshore Wind Tender with up to $8.3B Subsidy

(Reuters) Denmark will launch an offshore wind tender with a capacity of 3 GW, enough to power three million homes, its energy ministry said May 19, offering subsidies to developers of up to 55.2 billion Danish crowns (US$8.32 billion).

The offshore wind industry has grappled with skyrocketing costs, higher interest rates and supply chain bottlenecks—prompting governments to halt or postpone tenders due to a lack of interest from bidders.

“We need more secure green power and energy to make Denmark and Europe independent of energy from Russia,” Energy Minister Lars Aagaard said in a statement.

The bids offered in the tender will determine the level of subsidy needed, with a cap set at 55.2 billion crowns over 20 years.

“It is the bid price and the development of electricity prices that determine whether it will be necessary to support the projects, or whether money will come to the state,” the ministry said.

Denmark in January announced it would halt all ongoing offshore wind tenders to revamp its model, saying that a framework where no subsidies were offered did not work under existing market conditions.

A month earlier, the Nordic country failed to attract any bids in its biggest offshore wind tender yet, with analysts pointing to a rigid auction model and a failure to adapt to a changed economic reality for renewable energy projects.
