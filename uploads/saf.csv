The Sustainable Markets Initiative, founded by UK’s King Charles III in 2020 when he was Prince of Wales, has appointed Paul Griffiths, chief executive of Dubai Airports, as CEO Champion of its Sustainable Aviation Fuel Pathfinder Initiative, the organisation said on Thursday.

The initiative aims to accelerate the production and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is widely seen as the most viable near-term option for cutting aviation emissions. SAF can reduce flight emissions by up to 80 per cent, but currently accounts for less than 1 per cent of global jet fuel supply.

The SAF Pathfinder Initiative focuses on mobilising investment and demand signals to unlock production, advocating for harmonised global policies and incentives, enabling critical infrastructure upgrades, and driving collaboration across the aviation supply chain to address production and cost barriers.

Griffiths’ appointment comes as pressure mounts on the aviation industry to meet its long-term climate targets, including a sector-wide goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

Paul Griffiths: ‘SAF is one of the most important levers … to decarbonise flight’

“I’m honoured to take on this role at such a critical time for our industry,” Griffiths said in a statement. “Sustainable aviation fuel is one of the most important levers we have to decarbonise flight, and I’m committed to accelerating its availability and adoption across the sector.”

Griffiths said the work would align with the oneDXB Sustainability Alliance, a multi-stakeholder initiative led by Dubai Airports, which aims to drive decarbonisation, innovation, and resilience across Dubai International Airport and Dubai World Central – Al Maktoum International.

Under Griffiths’ leadership, Dubai Airports has achieved Level 4 “Transformation” accreditation from Airports Council International, placing it among the top 5 per cent of airports globally.

The accreditation reflects measures including collaboration with partners, the use of biodiesel-powered ground fleets, and the rollout of green infrastructure projects at Dubai International Airport.

SAF’s Claim on Biomass Global efforts to displace fossil jet fuel with renewable SAF will have a significant impact on biomass economics.
Maritime: The Next Major Biomass Competitor The maritime sector’s decarbonization requirements are beginning to exert a meaningful pull on the global renewable feedstock pool.","The center of gravity in biofuels is shifting, and an emerging pressure point is biomass. For years, road transport has dominated demand for waste- and residue-based feedstocks, absorbing most of the available supply of used cooking oil, tallow, distillers corn oil and other key inputs for renewable diesel and biodiesel production.

That era is ending.

Aviation and maritime mandates are accelerating at a time when biomass markets are tightening. The shift is creating a more competitive landscape for all participants, from refiners and traders to compliance teams and feedstock aggregators.

The question is no longer which fuel pathway grows fastest, but which sector secures the biomass first.

The New Demand Equation for Biomass

Across global markets, policy is no longer the sole driver of change. Physical biomass availability is emerging as a defining constraint. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and maritime fuels are adding new demand for the same limited pool of waste and residue oils. Both sectors will compete on price with road transport fuels to secure the feedstock needed to supply decarbonized fuels.

Several forces are tightening biomass markets simultaneously:

• Rising obligation levels in Europe for 2026 under RED III

• Stricter sustainability and traceability requirements narrowing usable supply

• Higher-value SAF pathways diverting upstream material

• Early-stage maritime adoption scaling trials into contracted volumes

As each sector claims more tonnage, the competition becomes structural rather than cyclical. Growing demand across all segments will continue to alter how these sectors operate.

SAF’s Claim on Biomass

Global efforts to displace fossil jet fuel with renewable SAF will have a significant impact on biomass economics. Refiners are increasingly testing every marginal unit of feedstock against potential SAF value, not just renewable diesel output.

What is changing:

• Current SAF production relies heavily on the same feedstocks as hydrotreated vegetable oil and renewable diesel.

• Compliance and voluntary airline demand are creating price premiums competitors cannot ignore.

• European SAF mandates are sharply increasing blending requirements.

• U.S. producers are optimizing for Section 40B and 45Z incentives, driving increased domestic SAF production.

As SAF scales, residual feedstock availability for transport renewables will tighten, requiring price adjustments to reflect these shifts.

Maritime: The Next Major Biomass Competitor

The maritime sector’s decarbonization requirements are beginning to exert a meaningful pull on the global renewable feedstock pool. The EU’s FuelEU Maritime emissions-intensity reductions, which began in 2025, require carriers to adopt low-carbon fuels well before ammonia, methanol or hydrogen reach broad commercial viability.

As a result, advanced biofuels such as used cooking oil methyl ester, fatty acid methyl ester blends and other bio-bunker fuels are entering direct competition for waste oils with road and aviation fuels.

The maritime sector may prove disruptive for several reasons:

• Large-volume consumption potential

• Immediate ability to use drop-in fuel blends

• Increased visibility of customer-driven decarbonization

While maritime demand remains relatively small today, its growth trajectory will draw biomass into a third major sector, further tightening supply.

A Feedstock Bottleneck is Forming

The most important market reality for 2026 is clear: The available biomass pool is not growing fast enough to meet policy-driven demand across all sectors.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cont1_biomass_shipyard_lede_0126_c249a52b97.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 05:58:23.652749

On Thursday, Washington leaders launched a nonprofit committed to sustainable aviation fuel, which promises to reduce aviation carbon emissions by 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

The nonprofit, called the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator, secured $20 million from state funding and a private donation to “de-risk” the production of sustainable aviation fuel, making it easier for companies, universities and institutions to study, develop and, eventually, produce the alternative fuel source.

Sustainable aviation fuel has been in the works for nearly two decades, but the industry has not taken off. SAF is slow and costly to produce and, though the technology is mature, there are few facilities producing the alternative fuel.

SAF accounted for less than 1% of annual jet fuel consumption last year, according to a December report from the International Air Transport Association.

On Thursday, Washington’s elected officials and aviation leaders gathered at Boeing’s Future of Flight museum in Mukilteo to celebrate the new initiative. Leaders from Boeing, Alaska, Amazon, Washington State University and the state Department of Commerce pledged again and again that Washington would be at the forefront of sustainable aviation, carrying on a legacy of aviation firsts in the state.

“We have all the pieces in place to ensure this once-in-a-generation economic opportunity is realized, and this accelerator will make that happen,” Gov. Bob Ferguson said.

“You have a partner in the state of Washington,” he told the aviation industry. “For this truly historic opportunity, we have to move our state forward.”

SAF is an alternative to petroleum that makes fuel from so-called “feedstocks.” There are several ways to make it, but all capture gases from renewable sources, like used cooking oils or animal waste. After a complicated process, SAF is eventually mixed with traditional jet fuel to lower carbon emissions during flight.

The accelerator introduced Thursday is meant to speed up both research and production, which will enable the state to produce SAF on a large scale. It will put Washington at the forefront of what the state expects will be the next economic boom in the aviation industry, the nonprofit’s leaders said.

Washington already passed legislation to accelerate permitting and environmental review for construction of clean energy plants and introduced a tax credit that provides subsidies for SAF.

At the celebratory event Thursday, Boeing announced that, starting this year, all its flights for operations and deliveries from Renton, Everett and Paine Field will fly on up to 30% SAF.

And SkyNRG, a Dutch company building a sustainable fuel production facility in Walla Walla, said Thursday it had completed state and county environmental reviews that will allow it to move forward with construction.

A ‘catalyst’ for the industry

The aviation industry has been chasing SAF for decades. Boeing conducted the world’s first test flight powered by biofuels with Virgin Atlantic in 2008.

Yet SAF production accounted for just 0.6% of annual jet fuel consumption last year, according to the December report from the International Air Transport Association.

SAF production doubled from 2024 to 2025, IATA found, totaling about 634 million gallons last year. For comparison, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport alone uses about 600 million gallons of jet fuel annually, according to the Port of Seattle.

The alternative fuel is also still pricey, IATA found. In 2025, the extra costs associated with SAF added $3.6 billion in fuel costs for the aviation industry.

On Thursday, Washington’s aviation industry nonetheless projected optimism. The accelerator it introduced is meant to tackle those problems, its supporters repeated over the course of the event.

Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell told the group “it’s probably late to the game to begin solving it at this scale, but it’s not too little. It’s exactly what’s needed.”

The accelerator’s list of partners is extensive: Alaska Airlines, Amazon, Boeing, the Port of Seattle, Snohomish County, the state Department of Commerce and Washington State University.

The group received $10 million in state appropriations last year and another $10 million from a philanthropic gift, said Sen. Marko Liias, a Democrat representing Edmonds. “We are now sitting on $20 million to catalyze this industry,” he said.

It’s not clear how far that funding will go, though.

SkyNRG, the Dutch company, originally estimated it would need $600 million to $800 million to get its facility up and running.

SkyNRG plant moves forward

John Plaza, the CEO of SkyNRG Americas, acknowledged at Thursday’s event that the industry has more demand for SAF than supply, but urged attendees to consider how far the initiative has come in the last 20 years.

“Lots of people like to say ‘there’s not enough SAF, we haven’t made enough progress,’” Plaza said. “Today, we’re past the theory. We’re into the implementation.”

SkyNRG set out to develop its Washington site in 2023, calling it Project Wigeon. The facility will sit on a 165-acre site at Wallula Gap and, once up and running, will produce 50 million gallons of SAF a year.

SkyNRG said Thursday the company secured approval from the state Department of Ecology and Walla Walla County to begin construction.

The company will start construction in 2028 and begin producing SAF in 2030.

Plaza declined to share how much private funding the company has for the Walla Walla facility. In 2025, the state Department of Commerce awarded a $1.5 million grant to the Port of Walla Walla to support SkyNRG’s construction of the facility.

Andy Billig, a former Washington state senator and now senior adviser for SkyNRG, said passing those environmental reviews was the hardest part of the process. The technology SkyNRG will use to make SAF is already in use elsewhere, Billig said, so he isn’t worried about putting it into practice.

“Now it feels like not easy sailing, but easier sailing,” he said.

However, actual price cuts depend on changes to domestic aviation fuel pricing mechanisms, industry insiders told Yicai.","(Yicai) Jan. 9 -- The merger between China Petroleum and Chemical, better known as Sinopec, and China National Aviation Fuel Group could help the aviation industry achieve its carbon reduction goals and may create room for a reduction in fuel costs, according to analysts.

The Sinopec-CNAF merger, announced by the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission yesterday, following approval from the State Council, the country's cabinet, is a landmark event in the latest round of state-owned enterprise reorganization, said Li Jin, chief researcher at the China Enterprise Research Institute. It is a proactive response to global competition and green transformation, he noted.

In addition, it is a crucial step in optimizing core business operations, which could catalyze more specialized integration among state-owned enterprises, Li pointed out.

The merger is expected to unlock significant potential in aviation's green transition. CNAF is Asia's largest aviation fuel service provider, integrating procurement, transportation, storage, testing, sales, and refueling, focusing on aviation fuel, petroleum, logistics, international business, and general aviation, while Sinopec is the world's largest refining firm and second-largest chemical company, ranking sixth in the 2025 Fortune Global 500.

Sustainable aviation fuel is crucial for the green transition, Li noted. Sinopec's SAF production tech, combined with CNAF's distribution channels, could accelerate the fuel's commercialization, helping the aviation industry meet carbon reduction goals and integrate green fuel into regular flights, he pointed out.

China's aviation fuel consumption will likely top 75 million tons by 2040 from 39.3 million tons in 2024, according to a forecast by S&P Global Ratings.

CNAF holds a virtual monopoly in the Chinese aviation fuel market, supplying all domestic and international airlines operating in the country, while also building or managing fueling facilities at most airports. However, the firm does not produce the fuel, sourcing it mainly from Sinopec, PetroChina, China National Offshore Oil, and overseas markets through its Singaporean subsidiary.

The merger will provide CNAF with more stable upstream resources while expanding Sinopec's sales channels. It could also reduce intermediary steps, potentially lowering aviation fuel prices.

The Sinopec-CNAF merger aims to optimize state capital allocation and prevent redundant competition, said Zhou Lisha, a researcher at the China Enterprise Reform and Development Research Association. CNAF occupies a crucial downstream position in the aviation fuel supply chain, with a sales network covering national airports and airline customers, so the move creates a ""refining-distribution"" system that could enhance supply chain stability and bargaining power, she noted.

However, actual price cuts depend on changes to domestic aviation fuel pricing mechanisms, industry insiders told Yicai. The ""comprehensive procurement cost"" combines factory prices with certain discounts, they said.

Factory prices are negotiated between suppliers and buyers, not exceeding the Singaporean market import prices after tax, which are announced monthly by the National Development and Reform Commission, incorporating international oil prices, exchange rates, and taxes, the insiders pointed out.

Some industry observers suggest that if the Sinopec-CNAF merger creates an integrated ""production-supply-sales"" chain, airlines that lack pricing power might find themselves in an even weaker position.

The blending target fixed by the government for SAF is 1%, 2% and 5% for 2027, 2028 and 2030, respectively. The industry’s optimism stems from the fact that the recent International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) SAF Report, launched in collaboration with Ministry of Civil Aviation, considers production of SAF through the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) process as the largest opportunity for India.

Incidentally, production of SAF through ATJ process is not a time tested technology. The first plant which uses this technology has just come up in Atlanta, US. If Indian bio-energy companies can build capacities and capability to use ethanol to produce SAF to be blended with aviation fuel, the country could be an early player in this segment.

India can produce 150 cr litre sugarcane SAF by 2030

Indian Sugar and Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) estimates India has the potential to produce 125-150 crore litre of sugarcane driven SAF by 2030 without affecting ethanol demand for petrol blending and alternative use cases. CORSIA Blending Targets (2030) as well as Global CORSIA Export Market (5%) can itself generate a demand for 150 crore litres by 2030, the industry body says.

Sameer Sinha, CEO, Sugar Business, Triveni Engineering and Industries Ltd agrees. According to him, if SAF happens, India has a very significant potential to emerge as an export hub as CORSIA blending targets will see demand for SAF increase globally and ethanol based SAF can be the cleanest option with demand coming from aviation hubs like Singapore in India’s East Coast and Dubai in the West Coast.

“India has a surplus of ethanol. The feedstock is already available, and Indian ethanol, compared to that of Brazil has less carbon intensity. Which means the cleaning of the environment is larger if I use the Indian ethanol versus the Brazilian ethanol. India is already exporting refined petroleum products to many countries, and SAF can be an addition. So India has multiple advantages”, he says.

Ethanol SAF manufacturing units cannot come up overnight

However, ethanol based SAF manufacturing facilities cannot come up overnight. Experts say it takes at least three and a half years to set up a green field facility running. Even if Indian companies invest in SAF today, the production will begin only when India’s annual SAF blending target reaches near 5%. That’s the time when volume demand will rise, ISMA says.

Sinha says government policy can play a major role in making SAF an attractive investment option for the industry. He expects government to assure 100% off take in the initial years, and also an administered pricing structure for SAF. A policy regime similar to what help ethanol blending in petrol in the country can help, he feels. “We have been engaged with the government and we believe the government is working on a policy and the policy should be out before the end of the financial year. That is our hope and expectation”, he said.

The SAF blending plan for 2027 will not be driven by ethanol based SAF. It will be based on used cooking oil (UCO). Indian Oil Corporation Limited had became the first Indian company to receive ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat Refinery, followed by the signing of an MoU between IOCL and Air India for SAF supply last year. The alcohol based SAF will take over only when the demand surge happens after the initial phase. In that sense, 2030 seems to be a good target.","https://media.fortuneindia.com/fortune-india/import/2022-03/0e53e74c-40b5-4ab1-9554-57c979ca9bce/atf.jpg?rect=0,0,1219,640&w=1200&ar=40:21&auto=format,compress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100",N,,2026-01-09 00:57:43.791923

That is the core idea behind sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.
The International Council on Clean Transportation says the fuel still costs two to five times more than conventional jet fuel.","EVERETT, Wash. — Just weeks after Washington officials acknowledged they overstated the climate benefits of past projects, the state is making a bold new promise about the future of flight.

The announcement came Thursday inside Boeing’s Future of Flight Museum, where state and aviation leaders unveiled what they are calling a multi-million-dollar push to turn Washington into a sustainable jet fuel powerhouse.

“We have all the pieces in place to ensure this once in a generation economic opportunity is realized and this accelerator will make that happen,” Governor Bob Ferguson said.

The event marked the official launch of the Cascadia Sustainable Accelerator, a new nonprofit designed to grow the region’s clean-fuel industry. The accelerator is funded by $10 million in state money and a separate $10 million private donation.

“It’s good for jobs, it’s good for the economy, it’s good for the environment and sustainable aviation fuel is the future of this industry,” Ferguson added.

At the same event, the Dutch-based company SkyNRG announced its first U.S. project: a 50-million-gallon-a-year sustainable aviation fuel facility planned for Walla Walla County.

“It’s been less than 20 years since the first airplane flew on something other than jet-fuel powered kerosene,” said John Plaza, SkyNRG’s chief executive.

The company says the plant will turn renewable natural gas, captured from landfills, farms and wastewater systems, into jet fuel. That is the core idea behind sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.

The Port of Seattle says SAF can cut lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions by about 50 to 80 percent. However, the cost is still higher than regular jet fuel. The International Council on Clean Transportation says the fuel still costs two to five times more than conventional jet fuel.

“Aviation has very few solutions to decarbonize,” Plaza said.

That optimism is now being tempered by fresh scrutiny of the state’s climate accounting. The push for SAF comes just weeks after Washington officials acknowledged they overstated emissions reductions in their latest climate impact report.

“86% of what they claimed was simply fake,” said Todd Myers, of the Washington Policy Center. “So what they said was we thought that these projects reduced 7.5 million metric tons of CO2 and the actual number was 78,000. That’s a huge error.”

SkyNRG says its carbon-reduction claims will be subject to oversight by both federal and state regulators.

“Everything we do will be overseen and implemented by both federal and state government as required to benefit from policy that helps reduce cost to the consumer,” Plaza said.",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/aea81acc-61b9-45c7-ae6f-3a0ecf555bd3/20260109T022450/aea81acc-61b9-45c7-ae6f-3a0ecf555bd3_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 00:57:56.104682

Reports accompanying the legislation include guidance on small refinery exemptions (SREs) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The House and Senate Appropriations Committee on Jan. 5 released the legislative package, which includes three bicameral, bipartisan fiscal year appropriations bills. The three bills include fiscal year 2026 appropriations for Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies; Energy and Water Development; and Interior, Environment and Related Agencies.

The legislative package, H.R. 6938, includes language on policies related to biomass energy. Specifically, Section 429 of the bill directs the U.S. Department of Energy, the USDA, and the U.S. EPA to jointly ensure that federal policy relating to biomass energy is consistent across all federal departments and agencies and recognizes the full benefits of the use of forest biomass for energy, conservation and responsible forest management. The agencies are also directed to establish clear and simple policies for the use of forest biomass as an energy solution, including policies that reflect the carbon neutrality of forest bioenergy and recognize biomass as a renewable energy source, provided the use of forest biomass for energy production does not cause conversion of forests to non-forest use. Biomass policies are also expected to encourage provide investment throughout the biomass supply chain, including forest bioenergy production.

The Senate Appropriations Committee on Jan. 5 also released an explanatory statement that accompanies the EPA appropriations bill. The report does not carry the force of law. Rather, it includes guidance on congressional intent regarding a variety of matters, including those related to the RFS and small refinery exemption (SRE) program.

Regarding the SRE program, the explanatory statement stresses that the EPA may exempt small refineries from compliance with the RFS in certain circumstances, and that small refineries “may at any time petition the Administrator for an extension of the exemption for the reason of disproportionate economic hardship.” The statement also directs EPA to develop policies and procedures for making SRE decisions consistent with a report published by the Government Accountability Office in November 2022.

That GAO report, titled ""Renewable Fuel Standard: Actions Needed to Improve Decision-Making in the Small Refinery Exemption Program,” was slammed as shoddy and obsolete by representatives of the U.S. biofuel industry.

Within the report, the GOA made seven specific recommendations. First, the agency recommended that the EPA reassess its conclusion that small refineries recover their RFS compliance costs in the price of gasoline and diesel they sell. Second, the GAO recommended the DOE develop an approach for consulting on SREs that provides EPA with useful information on disproportionate economic hardship. In addition, the GAO said the EPA should identify and communicate what refineries would need to submit to demonstrate disproportionate economic hardship; develop policies and procedures for making SRE decisions; develop policies and procedures to ensure the agency meets statutory deadlines; and assess the effect of SRE decision timing on the benefit provided to small refineries, as well as the effect on fuel markets, and reconsider petition requirements. The report also encouraged the DOE to develop policies and procedures for its consultation with EPA on SRE petitions.

The explanatory statement also directs the EPA to provide a briefing within 60 days on its proposed actions related to eRINs within the RFS program. In addition, the agency is directed to submit a report to lawmakers within 30 days that is focused on fuel derived from waste plastic or waste tires, including any plans the EPA may have to qualify such fuels as cellulosic biofuel under the RFS.

A separate explanatory statement released in conjunction with the portion of the legislative package providing fiscal year 2026 funding for the U.S. Department of Energy notes up to $5 million can be made available to continue supporting the development of new domestically manufactured, low-emission, high-efficiency resident wood heaters.

Lawmakers also specify that the appropriations funding agreement provides up to $5 million to support research and development aimed as advancing the supply of renewable natural gas (RNG), clean hydrogen, and other impactful products form syngas; up to $25 million for algae-related activities; and up to $10 million for research and development of the anaerobic bioproduction of 3-hydroxypropionic acid utilizing existing Midwest ethanol fermentation infrastructure and renewable whole-kernel corn feedstock.

Within the statement, lawmakers also encourage the DOE “to conduct research related to the development, pre-piloting, piloting, and demonstration scale-up of renewable liquefied petroleum gas or alternative fuels production, in parallel with the department’s focus on the scale-up of sustainable aviation fuel technologies.” The DOE is also “encouraged to pursue the advancement and development of pre-commercial, advanced sustainable aviation fuel feedstocks and technologies to include non-biogenic feedstocks and technologies, such as hydrogen-based e-fuels.”

MUKILTEO, Wash. — Industry leaders from the Pacific Northwest convened on Thursday at the Boeing Future of Flight Aviation Center to inaugurate the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator, a new initiative designed to establish the region as a leader in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) innovation. The event brought together elected officials, corporate executives, and academic figures to emphasize the region’s commitment to advancing cleaner aviation technologies.

Washington Governor Bob Ferguson emphasized the unique economic opportunity presented by the accelerator, stating, “We have all the pieces in place to ensure this once-in-a-generation economic opportunity is realized, and this accelerator will make that happen.” The initiative aims to overcome existing barriers to SAF adoption by fostering a robust marketplace, closing the price gap with conventional jet fuel, and increasing production capacity.

Addressing Challenges in Sustainable Aviation Fuel Adoption

Sustainable aviation fuel, typically derived from plant-based sources and waste materials, is widely regarded as the most promising and scalable solution to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector. Despite its potential, SAF remains at least twice as expensive as traditional jet fuel, limiting its widespread use even as airlines and logistics companies commit to sustainability goals.

The Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator launches with a combined $20 million in funding, including $10 million from the state and an equal amount from philanthropic sources. Amazon’s director of public policy, Guy Palumbo, highlighted the company’s role as a major SAF customer, noting Amazon’s planned purchase of 3.7 million gallons of SAF in 2024 to reduce the carbon footprint of its air cargo operations. Palumbo underscored the systemic nature of the challenge, stating, “This is a systems issue that no one company can solve. You’ve got great companies up here in this room right now that are ready to use this fuel, but we have to make it available.”

The launch event showcased the accelerator’s public-private partnership model, featuring remarks from Washington State Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyen, Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell, and executives from Alaska Airlines, Boeing, and SkyNRG. A panel discussion included representatives from Amazon, SkyNRG, the Machinists Union, and the Port of Seattle, reflecting the broad coalition supporting the initiative.

Strategic Focus and Industry Outlook

The accelerator’s strategy encompasses several key areas: providing research and development resources to startups and fuel manufacturers; advocating for SAF-friendly policies at both state and federal levels; facilitating funding and purchase agreements for producers; developing supply chains for diverse feedstocks such as agricultural waste, algae, cooking oils, and animal fats; and supporting infrastructure for transporting and blending low-carbon fuels with conventional aviation fuels.

Despite the Pacific Northwest’s strong aerospace heritage and concentration of industry leaders, significant challenges persist. Regulatory dependencies and protracted certification processes remain critical concerns, particularly for Boeing, whose future earnings and cash flow are closely linked to the commercial viability of SAF. Market responses to the accelerator’s launch have been mixed, with demand for freighter aircraft providing some support amid broader economic uncertainties influenced by Federal Reserve policy debates and fluctuating economic indicators.

Global competition is also intensifying. European governments and the European Space Agency are increasing investments in space and aviation technologies, while Amazon’s Leo space communications business competes against both established and emerging players in the sector.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?","MUKILTEO—Washington State Governor Bob Ferguson, Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers, Senator Marko Liias, other law makers, and leaders in aviation technology research and sustainability launched the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator (CSAA) today – a new initiative designed to accelerate Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production deployment and adoption across the Pacific Northwest.

“Clean fuels are a priority for Washington State. It’s good for jobs, it’s good for the economy, it’s good for the environment. And I think we can all agree that sustainable aviation fuel is literally the future of this industry,” said Gov. Ferguson. “The good news is that Washington is uniquely situated to be the leader in this massive fuel industry for decades, and generations, to come.”

In partnership with the Washington State Department of Commerce, CSAA is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the renewable fuels industry in the Pacific Northwest.

The announcement came at Boeing’s Future of Flight Aviation Center in Mukilteo on Thursday, January 8. The event consisted of remarks by government, and industry leaders and partners, followed by a panel discussion with CSAA Board vice chair and Managing Director, Earth Finance Tim Zenk, Amazon executive Guy Palumbo, SkyNRG executive and former State Sen. Andy Billig, Port of Seattle Executive Director Steve Metruck, and Machinists Union, District 751, Jon Holden. The topic of the panel discussion was focused on investment innovation and workforce development.

“Today we’re launching the next chapter in our state’s history, as a global, environmental, economic, and technology leader,” said Senator Liias. “In the last couple of years, I’ve been proud to champion for investments in the state legislature, most recently $10 million from WA State, met with a $10 million philanthropic match. So we’re sitting on a $20 million investment on catalyzing on this industry and that is so exciting.”

Liias thanked the Boeing Company, Alaska Airlines, Snohomish County, Microsoft, the Port of Seattle, Washington State University, Amazon, and the Washington State Department of Commerce for their continual support and partnership.

Gov. Ferguson, who followed Senator Liias in remarks, first deemed Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers as the “Washingtonian of the Day” for being the one person who has been forefront in the State’s initiative of bringing sustainable aviation fuel to, not only to Snohomish County, but to the state at large.

In 2023, the County, under Somers’ leadership, opened the world’s very first SAF Research and Development facility at the Snohomish County-operated Paine Field Airport. While the site is currently temporary, the county has plans to open a permanent facility at a later date – yet to be determined, according to Snohomish County Communications Director Kari Bray.

Well before, and even after, the opening of Paine Field’s SAF R&D facility, Somers has continued to be a champion for sustainable aviation fuel in Snohomish County and beyond, Ferguson said Thursday.

“We have the resources, we have the will, we have the leadership, and we have the partnership who are all here today. In other words, we all have pieces to play to ensure this once in a generation economic opportunity is realized,” said Gov. Ferguson.

Ferguson also thanked Washington State University for the continued research on SAF.

The ‘Washingtonian of the Day’ himself, and Chair of the CSAA, Executive Dave Somers, was next to speak beginning with a joke: “Sustainable jet fuel is great; same jet lag, but with a cleaner conscious.”

Somers was proud of Snohomish County’s role in Washington State’s economic footprint, being the home of the Boeing company who employees approximately 130,000 Washingtonians and contributes roughly $60 billion to the state annually.

“For all of these reasons, Snohomish County is really the perfect place to house the Cascadia Institute,” said Executive Somers. “The County has four keyholes for the future of research and development. First, we’ll bridge the gap between academia and history by partnering with Washington State University and eventually other national, and international institutions. The second is to lead the world in development, distribution, and adoption of new technologies to reduce the carbon-based footprint. The third is to address the skill shortage and to continue our efforts to create a gold standard in workforce development by connecting local youth to high-quality jobs in the field. Fourth is to attract international investment to our innovation, economy, and create jobs.”

Other speakers included Washington State Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyen, Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell, Hawaiian Airlines President and CEO Diana Birkett Rakow, and Boeing Vice President of State and Local Government Operations Bill McSherry. State, tribal, and community leaders were also in attendance to show their support.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the most viable pathway today to significantly reduce aviation emissions. Cascadia has the natural resources, research expertise, policy environment, infrastructure, workforce and industry leadership needed to become a global leader in SAF production.

The launch of CSAA marks a major step toward aligning public policy, private investment, research and community support to secure long-term economic and environmental benefits for our region. The launch is made possible by $10M in state funding and a $10M private gift.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

SAF’s are a biofuel with similar properties and safety requirements as conventional jet fuel used in aircraft but with a smaller carbon footprint. These certified “Jet-A1” fuels are made by blending conventional kerosene (fossil-based) with renewable hydrocarbon. Currently, SAFs are used as a “drop-in” replacement to conventional petroleum-based jet fuel that when combined called a blend. The minimal acceptance blend is 10% SAF to a high of 50%. The goal is a certified 100% replacement blend of SAF to conventional jet fuel.

A huge benefit to SAFs than alternative green aviation solutions such as electric and hydrogen powered aircraft fleets is the minimal disruption to implement into existing infrastructure. It is cost beneficial to ensure that manufacturers do not have to redesign engines nor aircraft, and that fuel suppliers and airports do not have to build new fuel delivery systems.

SkyNRG Secures Key Environmental Approvals to Advance Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Eastern Washington

Following Thursday’s remarks and panel discussion, SkyNRG announced a key milestone for Project Wigeon, a planned sustainable aviation fuel facility in Eastern Washington, after securing environmental approvals from the Washington State Department of Ecology and Walla Walla County.

The approvals confirm that the project meets state and local environmental standards, including requirements related to land use, water protection, and fuel transportation. Project Wigeon will be among North America’s first commercial-scale SAF projects producing jet fuel from renewable natural gas (RNG).

“Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to reduce harmful emissions, which is why SkyNRG is building SAF facilities such as Project Wigeon around the world,” said John Plaza, Chief Executive Officer of SkyRNG Americas. “The Department of Ecology’s environmental review and Walla Walla County’s approval demonstrate our commitment to building this facility the right way – using industry-leading technology and conducting robust analysis of environmental impacts. This milestone allows SkyNRG to continue delivering clean fuel to major airports, building economic opportunity in Eastern Washington, and protecting natural resources and community health for years to come.”

SkyNRG’s new facility will support a fast-expanding global demand, which is projected to reach five billion gallons by 2030 and more than 12 billion gallons by 2035.",https://lynnwoodtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_0623-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 19:57:15.590284

Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuel will be the future, said Ray Stephanson, president and CEO of Economic Alliance Snohomish County.","MUKILTEO — Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson joined Snohomish County officials and aviation executives Thursday morning to formally launch a sustainable jet fuel research center at Paine Field.

“I think we can all agree that sustainable aviation fuel is literally the future of this (aviation) industry,” Ferguson told the several hundred people gathered at the Boeing Future of Flight museum and tour center.

He said the state was uniquely positioned to host the center because Washington State University has become a key research center for the development of sustainable fuels.

The center, with $10 million in new funding from the state Legislature and $10 million from an anonymous donor, aims to make Snohomish County a global hub for the development of green aviation fuel. It’s scheduled to be built on an 8-acre site south of the main Paine Field runway.

Called the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator, the nonprofit would be run in conjunction with Snohomish County and Washington State University.

But Sen. Marko Liias, D-Everett, who helped secure an initial $6.5 million grant from the state Department of Transportation grant for the center back in April 2023, told the audience that the use of sustainable aviation fuel for airlines today accounts for less than 1% of the fuel carriers use.

He said increasing usage will be a difficult proposition.

“This is going to be a tremendous challenge,” he said. “It’s going to be hard. There are still barriers that we need to overcome.”

After the program, Liias said that building a permanent home for the center will require up to $40 million in additional funding.

He said he expects the legislature to be asked to appropriate additional funds in the future, and that a campaign will be mounted to secure additional grants and private funding. Liias said federal funds could also be a possibility but, for now, Congress has let previous sustainable fuel aid programs expire.

Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers, who chairs the Cascadia Accelerator board, said after the program that a temporary facility will open in the next several months in a rented building at Paine Field, with suites for labs and offices. He said several storage tanks will also be built in the next year to house the sustainable fuel.

Somers said funding challenges do remain, but he was confident that the center would be built.

Somers, speaking earlier at the event, said the accelerator’s partnership with Washington State University will establish a “world-class research and development facility.”

“Combined with our region’s aviation industry cluster, these developments ensure we will be a leader in global aviation sustainability and investment well into the future,” he said.

Proponents of sustainable aviation fuel, which is made from plants, sewage and or food, tout it as the future of aviation mobility. However, the current costs for airlines to use the fuel are two to three times the cost of conventional jet fuel, said Joshua Heyne, director of the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab at Washington State University in Pullman.

Heyne, who said he has tested sustainable jet fuel from 40 companies in his lab, said that, currently, the sustainable fuel must be blended with conventional jet fuel to power an airline.

He said more research is needed on fuels that don’t require blending.

Consequently, he said, airlines use very little of the fuel as they aim to be price-competitive with other airlines.

“Fuel costs are a major contributor to airline fares,” he said.

Heyne said that sustainable aviation fuel accounts for a minor share of the fuel airlines use today.

The International Air Transport Association, which represents 300 airlines globally, said its statistics show that SAF production accounted for only 0.3% of global jet fuel production, though it has double the 2023 level.

The association said initial projections for 2024 show that companies had planned to produce more than three times what they estimated.

SAF volumes are increasing, but disappointingly slowly,” the association said in a press release on its website. “Governments are sending mixed signals to oil companies, which continue to receive subsidies for their exploration and production of fossil oil and gas.”

The commercial aviation industry has pledged to transition to 100% sustainable fuel use by 2050.

How the center will work and how many people it will employ is still being worked out, Heyne said. Under the accelerator model being explored, companies could work with the center’s staff to help develop their sustainable fuel products, he said.

Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuel will be the future, said Ray Stephanson, president and CEO of Economic Alliance Snohomish County.

He said the establishment of the center is a positive for Snohomish County, but it’s pretty early in the process and unclear how many jobs it will bring for now.

“We’re going to have to accelerate our learning curve and bring this fuel to market in a way that it could be used in substantial quantities,” he said.",https://www.heraldnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/41260607_web1_TSR-EDH-SustainableAviation-EDH-260108-fs.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:57:53.433723

Announced Jan. 8 at the Boeing Future of Flight in Everett, the accelerator brings together state leaders, aviation and manufacturing partners, research institutions, Tribal representatives, labor, and community organizations to rapidly scale the production and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Funded through a 2025 state legislative appropriation and an additional $10 million in private philanthropic support, CSAA is the most comprehensive initiative of its kind in the Pacific Northwest.

WSU President Betsy Cantwell said the partnership reflects both the urgency and the opportunity facing the aviation sector.

“Aviation connects people, communities, and economies across Washington, the nation, and the world,” Cantwell said. “But for aviation to remain strong and resilient in the decades ahead, sustainability must be part of its future. That’s why partnerships like this one matter so much.”

Research driving real-world impact

WSU researchers from eight programs across three colleges are advancing work on sustainable aviation fuels, spanning alternative feedstocks, fuel testing and certification, supply-chain logistics, economic impacts, and policy frameworks. That breadth of work positions the university to contribute at every stage of SAF development, from early research to commercial deployment.

“We are fortunate to have some of the world’s leading experts in this field at WSU,” Cantwell said, recognizing faculty leaders Josh Heyne and Mike Wolcott during the launch event. “Their leadership, along with the dedication of their colleagues and students, has helped position WSU at the forefront of sustainable aviation fuels research, both nationally and globally.”

SAF is produced from renewable and waste-based feedstocks such as oilseed crops, agricultural residues and forestry byproducts. When used in place of conventional jet fuel, SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% while meeting the safety and performance standards required for commercial aviation.

As part of these efforts, WSU is partnering with Snohomish County to establish a world-leading Sustainable Aviation Fuel Research and Development Center at Paine Field Airport. This work will accelerate research, testing, and adoption of sustainable aviation fuels that can dramatically reduce the aviation industry’s dependence on carbon-based fuels and help decarbonize air travel.

The Center will host the world’s first SAF repository, where fuel samples are collected, tested at laboratory and larger scales, indexed, and distributed globally to support research and commercialization. WSU researchers, including experts from WSU’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Laboratory, will lead efforts in fuel testing, finishing, and scaling while collaborating with government, industry, and academic partners to foster innovation, workforce development, and economic growth in the region.

National leadership in sustainable aviation

WSU’s role in CSAA builds on nearly a decade of national leadership in the field. The university also serves as a co-leader, alongside the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, of ASCENT — the FAA-convened Center of Excellence for Alternative Jet Fuels and Environment.

The consortium brings together universities, federal agencies, national laboratories and private-sector partners to advance sustainable air transportation.

Looking ahead

Aviation currently accounts for roughly 2–3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, and demand for air travel is expected to grow. Leaders at the launch event emphasized that SAF offers one of the most promising near-term pathways to reduce emissions while maintaining safety, affordability, and reliability.

As CSAA moves forward, WSU will continue contributing its research expertise, convening power, and land grant perspective to help ensure sustainable aviation fuels are developed responsibly and at scale.",https://wpcdn.web.wsu.edu/news/uploads/sites/2797/2026/01/planes-on-tarmac.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:57:59.260789

In 2025, the company advanced several key levers of its sustainability strategy, from scaling sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to electrifying last‑mile delivery and building solar‑powered infrastructure.

These achievements mark meaningful progress toward DHL’s goal of net‑zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and reinforce its role in building more sustainable, efficient, and resilient global trade.

Here are five milestones that defined this progress.

Advancing sustainable aviation: Largest SAF agreement in the U.S.

Air freight remains the most carbon-intensive mode of transport per ton-kilometer, and DHL has been a pioneer in adopting SAF since 2021. In 2025, DHL signed one of its largest-ever SAF agreements with Phillips 66: over 240,000 metric tons (approximately 314 million liters) of SAF over three years. This will reduce lifecycle emissions by approximately 737,000 metric tons of CO2e – about the same impact as 2,400 one-way flights from Los Angeles to Frankfurt. The fuel, produced in California, will primarily serve DHL’s West Coast operations.

Cutting emissions at sea: Partnership with CMA CGM

Ocean freight moves most global goods, making sustainable marine fuel (SMF) critical for reducing emissions. DHL and CMA CGM partnered to purchase 8,800 metric tons of UCOME second-generation biofuel, enabling an estimated 25,000 metric tons of CO₂e emissions reduction on a well-to-wake basis (covering the full lifecycle of fuel emissions). That is roughly equivalent to powering a large container ship for several days of operation. This collaboration demonstrates a significant step for low-carbon maritime transport.

Hydrogen on the horizon: First pilot in the Middle East

Hydrogen-powered trucks are emerging as a solution for decarbonizing long-haul logistics, providing longer range than electric trucks. DHL has been actively testing hydrogen trucks in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific, and will now introduce them in the Middle East. Last year, DHL signed an MoU with Hyperview in Saudi Arabia to pilot hydrogen-powered trucks. The project aligns with Saudi Vision 2030 and includes a feasibility study for hydrogen infrastructure, reinforcing DHL’s commitment to reduce logistics-related greenhouse gas emissions in emerging markets.

Fully electric delivery across Germany

DHL aims to electrify 66% of its last-mile fleet – the final step of getting a shipment to the end customer – by 2030, with Germany leading the charge. In 2025, the company announced one of its largest electric‑vehicle purchases: 2,400 new Ford electric vans for its Post & Parcel Germany division, the majority of which have already been delivered and are in operation. This milestone means that onethird of all German postcodes will benefit from zero-GHG-emission last-mile delivery, powered by a fleet of more than 35,000 electric vehicles, including e-trikes, e-vans, and e-bikes.

Solar-powered warehousing in Asia

Beyond operational carbon neutrality, DHL is exploring facilities that produce or source renewable energy on-site, combining sustainability with energy self-sufficiency. In Thailand last year, DHL launched a solar-powered warehouse expected to generate 100% of its energy on-site through a 4.2 MWp solar array and advanced battery storage. This facility eliminates reliance on fossil-based grid electricity and sets a blueprint for future logistics infrastructure worldwide.",https://www.thebwa.com/wp-content/uploads/Solar.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 04:12:57.225564

In the coming months, the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator is moving temporarily into a commercial space at Everett’s Paine Field airport.","MUKILTEO, Wash. — Pacific Northwest leaders on Thursday celebrated the official launch of the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator, an initiative that aspires to establish the region as a leader in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“We have all the pieces in place to ensure this once-in-a-generation economic opportunity is realized, and this accelerator will make that happen,” said Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson.

SAF is widely viewed as the most promising, scalable solution for cutting carbon emissions from aviation. The fuel is typically made from plant-based sources and can be blended with conventional fossil fuels used to power aircraft. But it costs twice as much or more than existing fuels, and the industry has struggled to take off in the U.S. or internationally despite sustainability pledges by airlines and others.

The new accelerator hopes to close that price gap, create a SAF marketplace and boost fuel production. It’s kicking off with $10 million in state funding and a $10 million philanthropic gift.

Guy Palumbo, Amazon’s director of public policy, said the company is a SAF customer, buying 3.7 million gallons of the fuel in 2024 to make a small dent in the carbon impact of its air cargo transportation. And it would buy much more, he added, but the fuel isn’t available.

“This is a systems issue that no one company can solve,” Palumbo said. “You’ve got great companies up here in this room right now that are ready to use this fuel, but we have to make it available.”

The event highlighted the initiative’s public-private partnership by featuring speakers that also included Washington State Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyen, Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell, county and state elected officials, leaders from Alaska Airlines, Boeing, SkyNRG and others.

The accelerator has a multi-pronged strategy that includes:

Providing R&D resources for startups and other fuel manufacturers, including equipment and expertise.

Promoting SAF-friendly policies.

Helping facilitate funding for SAF producers, including purchase agreements with SAF customers.

Developing feedstock supply chains for the fuel, which can include waste from agriculture and logging, algae, cooking oils, animal fats and manure.

Supporting infrastructure development for transporting and blending low-carbon fuels with traditional aviation fuels to create SAF.

Establishing the sector is a Herculean task, but supporters argue this region is well-positioned for a SAF hub, citing its status as Boeing’s original home, its robust aviation industry, the availability of feedstocks, its strong environmental policies, and other strengths.

Despite years of work by organizations in Washington and around the globe, SAF comprises less than 1% of the aviation fuel in use today. And geopolitics — most recently including President Trump’s plans to begin cranking up oil production in Venezuela — continue to complicate progress.

“This is going to be a tremendous challenge. It’s going to be hard,” said Sen. Marko Liias. But, he added, “we know the rest of the world is going all in on SAF and this is the fuel of the future. There’s no better place than Washington state to catalyze the production of sustainable aviation fuel at scale.”

The need is pressing. Aviation’s impact on carbon emissions is growing as flights serving passenger travel and air cargo increase. There are companies developing sustainable aircraft, such as those powered by batteries and hydrogen fuel cells, but that technology will take decades to scale and its applications are uncertain. SAF, on the other hand, can be used in existing aircraft.

Multiple SAF companies are already operating in the Pacific Northwest:

SkyNRG is a Dutch company building a SAF facility in Walla Walla, Wash., and will use renewable natural gas that’s captured at landfills and from dairy waste as a feedstock. On Thursday the company announced it has secured key environmental approvals from the state, and plans to start commercial operations in 2030.

Montana Renewables is manufacturing approximately 30 million gallons of synthetic paraffinic kerosene, or SPK, per year which is blended with jet fuel to make SAF. The Montana company employs used cooking oils, animal fat from meat production, and plant oils as its feedstock and plans to dramatically increase production.

NXTClean Fuels has plans to develop two clean fuels facilities in Oregon. Its flagship site, a $3 billion plant at Port Westward on the Columbia River, is in the final stages of federal permitting and could break ground this year, with operations starting in late 2028 at the earliest.

Twelve is a California-based company that broke ground in 2023 on a SAF facility called AirPlant One in Moses Lake, Wash., and is currently commissioning its facility. It plans to use liquid ethanol produced in the state as its carbon source.

In the coming months, the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator is moving temporarily into a commercial space at Everett’s Paine Field airport. Initial funding has been secured to build a new facility, with the hope of completing construction no later than 2029.

The accelerator effort took root two years ago when Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers announced plans for a SAF center and state legislators from the county committed to seek funding for the initiative.

“Washington has been the SAF leader from the beginning,” said SkyNRG executive and former state Sen. Andy Billig. The first commercial test flight using SAF came from a Washington producer and was used on a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747-400 flying from London to Amsterdam in 2008.",https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PXL_20260108_1850586221.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 17:58:30.636508

Announced at the Boeing Future of Flight, the initiative is the most comprehensive and well-funded across the region of its kind to accelerate the production, deployment and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Funded through a 2025 State of Washington appropriation and private philanthropic donation of an additional $10 million, the CSAA positions the Pacific Northwest as a global leader in an accelerated transition to sustainable aviation fuel while capitalizing on the once-in-a-generation economic opportunity of scaling local SAF production. In partnership with the Washington State Department of Commerce, CSAA is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the renewable fuels industry in the Pacific Northwest.

The Cascadia region has been a trailblazer in aerospace innovation for over a century, and today it is uniquely positioned as a global center of aviation innovation, with an opportunity to unlock the next generation of sustainable fuel. With access to local, low carbon feedstocks, affordable clean energy, established infrastructure and a skilled workforce, the region has all the elements necessary to support production of up to one billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2035. Scaling production at this level would drive economic prosperity and development, strengthen regional energy security and independence, support state and regional climate initiatives and build on Cascadia’s long legacy as an aviation innovator.

The global aviation industry, which generates some $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, in addition to other environmental impacts. SAF is a safe, effective drop-in solution projected to be used for the next 70-plus years that can reduce emissions by 80% compared to fossil-based fuels and the transition to a thriving circular economy through locally produced SAF.

The Jan. 8 launch event featured remarks from leaders across the aviation, research and public sectors. Executives from Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines and Boeing spoke to the importance of aligning the full ecosystem of manufacturers and operators, policy, research, financing and public awareness to scale sustainable aviation fuel and secure the long-term future of aviation. Representative Mia Gregerson highlighted the need to center sustainability and airport communities as the industry transitions to cleaner fuels. Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell underscored the role of research and innovation in advancing sustainable aviation fuel from the lab to commercial deployment, while Washington State Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn addressed the state’s investments in clean energy, economic development and partnerships with Tribal nations.

The event also hosted a panel discussion moderated by Tim Zenk, a sustainable aviation fuel expert at Earth Finance, featuring executives Guy Palumbo at Amazon; Andy Billig, board member at SkyNRG; labor leader Jon Holden, Machinists Union, District 751; and Port of Seattle Executive Director Steve Metruck. The panel focused on investment pathways, workforce development and the economic opportunity presented by large scale sustainable aviation fuel production.

Word of the merger initiated by Beijing first emerged in November 2025, involving CAO’s parent China National Aviation Fuel (CNAF) and Sinopec – also known as China Petrochemical.

CAO said that following deliberation by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Council, an institution under the State Council of China, the two companies would proceed with the “corporate restructuring”.

It added that the restructuring remains subject to further approvals and filing procedures in accordance with applicable regulations.

Sinopec is China’s biggest oil and petrochemical products supplier. The company is also the largest refining company and the second-largest chemical company in the world. The Fortune 500 firm’s Singapore interests include petrochemical trading, marine bunkering operations and the sale of refined and chemical products. It also operates petrol stations in Yishun and Bukit Timah.

Sinopec is expected to absorb all of CNAF’s assets and operations if the merger goes through, Bloomberg reported, quoting a source.

CNAF owns 51 per cent of CAO, and, on occasion, balances domestic supplies by importing or exporting cargoes via trading arms such as the company.

The core business of CAO is in jet fuel supply and trading. It is the largest physical jet fuel buyer in the Asia-Pacific and the key importer of such fuel into China.

China is one of the world’s biggest civil aviation markets. Demand for air travel has rebounded sharply since the end of the pandemic, with flights returning to the skies.

The country is expected to consume more than 40 million tonnes of jet fuel this year, or close to a million barrels a day – valued at about US$30 billion at prevailing prices.

Research from Sweden’s Linnaeus University suggests that operating near-full, economy-only seating, combined with efficient airframes, could halve CO2 emissions.

Frequently described as one of the most carbon-intensive activities, aviation accounts for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, but has contributed around 4% to global warming to date.

Commercial airlines burned the equivalent of 892-936 million tonnes of CO2 in 2019, and without intervention, this figure is projected to rise as air travel demand grows.

Airline efficiency could halve aviation CO2 emissions

In the study published by Communications Earth & Environment, researchers highlight that policymakers, airlines and other stakeholders need to think beyond alternative fuels and new technologies to reduce aviation’s CO2 emissions. They should also rethink how aircraft are configured and operated.

The report led by Prof. Stefan Gössling at Linnaeus University found that operating flights with only economy-class seating on efficient aircraft with optimum load factors could theoretically reduce commercial aviation’s CO2 emissions by nearly 50% compared with current practices.

Commenting on the study, Gössling said: “We found that at least 50% (and up to 75%) of current fuel use could be avoided if airlines were forced to operate at maximum efficiency, while still transporting the same number of passengers over the same distances.”

He also argued that while much of the focus to reduce CO2 emissions has been on sustainable fuels, producing SAF is an expensive and uncertain process with a “significant business risk.” Instead, “It is far more prudent to reduce fuel use,” he said.

Carbon-intensive city pairs and airports

Gössling and his fellow researchers analysed data on 27.5 million flights between 26,156 city pairs in 2023 to understand the variations in CO2 emissions per passenger. The results showed that efficiency differs by region.

Flights departing from airports in the US, Australia and parts of Africa were found to be the most polluting. Atlanta and New York were among the airports with the least efficient flights overall. The study also found that the US – the largest emitting country in the world – had over 14% more polluting flights than the global average.

Airports in India, Brazil and Southeast Asia were primarily served by less polluting flights.

Typically, larger airports have a higher efficiency averaged across arriving and departing flights, while smaller airports that often serve less busy flights have a lower efficiency rating.

Crucially, the report highlighted that operating all routes at their demonstrated optimum could cut emissions by 10.7%. The theoretical 50% reduction is possible with all-economy layouts on the most efficient aircraft and 95% load factors.

Key efficiency measures for reducing CO2 emissions of airlines

Phasing out inefficient aircraft models (27% to 34% efficiency gain)

(Plus) removing premium-class seating (total 46% to 71% efficiency gain)

(Plus) increasing load factors (55% to 76% efficiency gain)

Why economy-only seating matters for airline carbon emissions

While factors influencing fuel consumption and the wider adoption of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are well documented, variations in operational efficiency across global markets have received far less attention.

In response, the Linnaeus University study explores not only the total fuel burned but also how that fuel translates into emissions per revenue passenger-kilometre (RPK) – or the amount of CO2 emitted to carry one paying passenger per km.

Researchers also found that modern aircraft vary widely in their CO2 intensity. The most efficient route (31.6g CO2/RPK) was from Milan in Italy to Incheon Airport in South Korea, while the least efficient (888.3g CO2/ RPK) was between two destinations – Kavieng and Tokua Laukunai, in Papua New Guinea.

It’s no great surprise that newer, lighter and more aerodynamic aircraft will burn significantly less fuel per passenger than their older counterparts. However, the seating layout and passenger load matter because emissions are spread over more people.

Premium seating takes up more space per passenger but generates roughly the same emissions as economy seats for the same flight distance. Configuring an aircraft with all-economy layouts increases the number of seats filled and spreads the emissions more thinly.

The International Air Transportation Association (IATA) reiterates this. It suggests that business and first-class seats are up to five times more CO2-intensive than economy class seats.

The report also highlighted that beyond seating, procedural and more efficient routing also contribute to additional gains. When implemented at scale across airline networks and regions, it’s this ecosystem of operational improvements combined that underpins the theoretical halving of emissions.

Real-world challenges and trade-offs

While the report’s theoretical reduction in CO2 emissions is compelling, significant practical challenges remain.

Passenger preferences continue to influence both seating choices and airline selection. Many travellers value the space, comfort and discretion offered in premium cabins. There is also the risk that previously premium passengers will switch to business jets, which would only further increase the global emissions per passenger-kilometre.

For airlines, these higher-yield products are also integral to commercial strategies, subsidising economy fares and supporting route viability.

What’s more, achieving 95% load factors or at least close to it and all-economy configurations could require policy incentives or restrictions, as well as higher chargers.

Gossling argues that “while strong resistance can be expected, the trade-off is essentially a temporary reduction in personal comfort for a minority of passengers in exchange for avoiding around half a gigatonne of CO2 emissions (in addition to non-CO2 effects).” In fuel terms, this would be equivalent to eliminating the need for approximately 150Mt of SAF.”

Ultimately, the study underlines that meaningful CO2 emission reductions do not rely solely on innovative fuel technology and new aircraft. Changes in how aircraft are configured and operated could also deliver substantial gains. It also reinforces that emissions per passenger are shaped as much by how we fly as what we fly.

As a result, Outokumpu Tornio site provides an optimal location for large-scale, cost-efficient eSAF production in Europe.","Outokumpu initiated a collaboration with Norsk e-Fuel to convert carbon side streams into eSAF – enabling 200,000-ton direct emission reduction for Outokumpu

Outokumpu, the global leader in sustainable stainless steel, and Norsk e-Fuel, a Nordic pioneer in Power-to-Liquid project development, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to work together towards realizing a CO-to-SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) production plant to be located next to Outokumpu’s stainless steel mill in Koivuluoto, Tornio, Finland. Under the signed MoU, Norsk e-Fuel will start a feasibility study in 2026. If the study leads to positive results, Norsk e-Fuel anticipates taking an investment decision around 2028, with production start planned for 2032.

Outokumpu would provide carbon monoxide (CO) side streams from its ferrochrome production as a feedstock for the production of 80,000-100,000 tons of eSAF annually, supporting the EU’s eSAF quota and advancing the decarbonization of aviation – one of the hard-to-abate sectors. Once operational, the eSAF plant would create financial value for Outokumpu through increased side stream utilization. The project will support Outokumpu’s decarbonization journey by allowing the company to reduce direct CO₂ emissions by 200,000 tons annually, representing 20% of Outokumpu's global direct emissions. In addition, it would contribute to the EU’s targets for the clean energy transition and increase the EU’s resilience and strategic independence through strengthening domestic fuels supply.

Norsk e-Fuel will lead the project development, drawing on its longstanding experience and strong partner network to carry out engineering, secure financing and engage future customers for the produced fuels. Responsible for funding the project, Norsk e-Fuel estimates the investment to be approximately EUR ~1.2–1.5 billion while expecting to create approximately 250 new jobs locally.

“Decarbonization is at the core of Outokumpu’s strategy and demonstrates our vision to lead in sustainable materials and technologies. We continuously seek new smart ways to reduce climate emissions across the entire value chain, and our Kemi-Tornio ecosystem provides an excellent platform to further strengthen the circular economy, while delivering financial value to Outokumpu. The partnership with Norsk e-Fuel demonstrates how Outokumpu’s commitment to sustainability extends beyond low-emission stainless steel and ferrochrome production to the utilization of our side streams”, says Martti Sassi, President for Business Area Ferrochrome at Outokumpu.

“The collaboration with Outokumpu brings together two companies with complementary strengths and a shared ambition to advance the energy transition in Finland and Europe. Outokumpu’s industrial platform and available side streams, combined with our experience in developing Power-to-Liquid projects, create a strong foundation for competitive eSAF production in Tornio. We value the openness and ambition Outokumpu brings to this partnership, and we are looking forward to evaluating the potentials of this eSAF project that will support both aviation decarbonization and Europe’s energy resilience”, says Lars Bjørn Larsen, CCO at Norsk e-Fuel.

Finland – one of the best locations in Europe for SAF production. Driven by abundant supply of clean electricity, public support for hydrogen economy development and access to relevant resources, Finland ranks among the best locations in Europe for eSAF production*. Within Finland, the Bothnia Bay region stands out due to its robust industrial infrastructure and access to recycled carbon streams with Outokumpu Tornio site offering the most competitive carbon sources available. Its carbon monoxide (CO) stream is continuously available throughout the year in high volumes and concentrations and is collected at a single point. This enables eSAF production with lower investment requirements and operating costs compared to projects based on captured CO₂. As a result, Outokumpu Tornio site provides an optimal location for large-scale, cost-efficient eSAF production in Europe.

The planned eSAF production facility is intended to become a benchmark project of Outokumpu's circular ecosystem in the Koivuluoto area of Tornio. The cooperation with Norsk e-Fuel will mark the first industrial development in the area supporting Outokumpu’s ambition to build a vibrant circular economy ecosystem.

“Our Tornio site is already among the largest recycling hubs in Europe, processing over one million tonnes of scrap annually. Our long-term vision is to host multiple new projects at the Koivuluoto area that would utilize our other side streams and attract new partnerships to join the ecosystem”, says Tommi Silvennoinen, Senior Manager, Strategic Partnerships in CCUS and New Energy Solutions at Outokumpu.

At that scale, Etlas expects to enable the production of more than 800,000 metric tonnes of biofuels per year.
Global demand for SAF is projected to increase sharply, reaching up to 10 million tonnes by 2030, compared with roughly 1 million tonnes in 2024.
Similarly, demand for renewable diesel is expected to grow from around 17 million tonnes in 2024 to as much as 35 million tonnes by 2030.
Etlas aims to connect agricultural innovation with energy demand, scaling production globally while creating new revenue opportunities for farming communities.","Corteva Inc. and bp have announced the formation of Etlas™, a newly established 50:50 joint venture focused on developing and supplying plant-based oil feedstocks for the rapidly expanding biofuels market. The venture is designed to support the production of low-carbon fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel (RD), by sourcing oil from crops such as canola, mustard, and sunflower.

Etlas combines the complementary strengths of its two parent companies. Corteva brings more than a century of experience in seed science, crop genetics, and agricultural innovation, which will be applied to develop and optimize oilseed crops specifically tailored for biofuel applications. bp contributes its extensive expertise in fuel refining, processing, distribution, and marketing, along with deep connections to the global commercial transportation sector. Together, these capabilities are intended to create a reliable, scalable, and commercially viable feedstock supply chain that can support the long-term growth of biofuels.

The joint venture has set an ambitious production target of one million metric tonnes of feedstock annually by the mid-2030s. At that scale, Etlas expects to enable the production of more than 800,000 metric tonnes of biofuels per year. Initial volumes of feedstock are planned to become available from 2027 onward, supplying both co-processing units at existing refineries and dedicated biofuel production facilities. This phased approach allows Etlas to integrate smoothly into current refining infrastructure while also supporting the expansion of specialized biofuel plants.

Industry forecasts highlight why such initiatives are gaining momentum. Global demand for SAF is projected to increase sharply, reaching up to 10 million tonnes by 2030, compared with roughly 1 million tonnes in 2024. Similarly, demand for renewable diesel is expected to grow from around 17 million tonnes in 2024 to as much as 35 million tonnes by 2030. Etlas has been structured specifically to address this anticipated growth by ensuring consistent availability of sustainable feedstocks at scale.

A defining feature of the Etlas model is its agricultural approach. The feedstock crops will be grown on existing farmland during periods between primary food crop cycles. These intermediate or cover-season crops can enhance soil health, improve nutrient management, and reduce erosion, while also generating additional income for farmers. Importantly, because these crops utilize land that would otherwise remain fallow or underused, they do not increase pressure on land resources or compete directly with food production.

Judd O’Connor, executive vice president of Corteva’s seed business unit, emphasized that Etlas reflects Corteva’s broader mission of supporting both global energy needs and agricultural communities. He noted that agriculture can play a meaningful role in the energy transition, and that Etlas demonstrates how innovation in farming can contribute to lower-carbon fuel solutions while benefiting growers.

From bp’s perspective, Philipp Schoelzel, senior vice president for biofuels growth, described the joint venture as a capital-light strategy that adds flexibility to bp’s biofuels value chain. By partnering with Corteva, bp aims to strengthen its market position, respond to evolving customer demand, and generate competitive returns.

Leadership for the new company has also been announced. Ignacio Conti, Global Business Development Director at Corteva, will serve as Chief Executive Officer of Etlas, while Gaurav Sonar, bp’s vice president for Novel Feedstocks, will take on the role of Chair of the Board of Directors. According to Conti, as aviation and transport sectors seek dependable, cost-effective, and sustainable fuel options, farmers will play a central role. Etlas aims to connect agricultural innovation with energy demand, scaling production globally while creating new revenue opportunities for farming communities.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-08 09:57:14.131619

Top five asks

Ask #1: Extending concessional corporate tax rate for new manufacturing companies

The existing 15 percent concessional corporate tax rate has played a key role in attracting investments into India. Under Section 115BAB, new domestic manufacturing companies are eligible for this rate. However, a crucial requirement for these companies is that they must have started manufacturing by 31 March 2024.

By attracting foreign investments, this provision has been crucial in achieving economic objectives. As a result, the tax administration may extend the regime’s sunset clause for two additional years. This extension will undoubtedly boost India’s economic growth and increase the country’s attractiveness to investors.

Extending the concessional tax rate would help manufacturing sector investors, who are currently considering or setting up businesses in India, to take advantage of this opportunity.

Ask #2: Providing concessional tax rate on sale of all carbon credits and Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and, not limited to carbon credits validated by the UN Framework on Climate Change (UNFCC), along with clarification on set-off of losses and unabsorbed depreciation thereof

Sale of carbon credits validated by the UNFCC is currently eligible for a concessional tax rate under Section 115BBG of the Income Tax Act. This provision does not apply to VERs, RECs, etc.

Therefore, a concessional tax rate should be offered to all carbon credits, RECs, etc., to encourage the sector, reduce litigation and bring carbon credits at par. Additionally, specific clarification allowing the set-off of losses and unabsorbed depreciation against sale of such carbon credits, VERs and RECs should be provided.

Ask #3: Offering tax incentives for Green Bonds – New section recommended

Interest income earned by investors in Green Bonds may be considered tax exempt in the hands of investors.

Additionally, profits earned by investors in Green Bonds from the sale/transfer of such bonds may be treated as tax exempt in the hands of the investors, irrespective of whether such profits/gains are offered to tax in India by investors as business profits or capital gains. It will also indirectly help bond issuers, as they will be able to get a lower borrowing rate.

To ensure clarity, the definition of Green Bonds may be aligned with the regulatory prescription issued by SEBI for granting such income tax benefits.

The income tax exemption may be granted to such bond investors, irrespective of whether (i) the bonds are issued under the FDI, FPI or the ECB window, (ii) the bonds are issued by an Indian issuer entity or a financier such as a bank/NBFC/HFC, or (iii) the bonds are listed or unlisted.

Ask #4: Providing guidelines for revenue recognition in case of BOOT/BOT projects/HAM for power, roadways and other ERI projects

BOT/BOOT/HAM models are commonly used in the ERI sector. Considering the extant ambiguity, specific guidelines regarding the adoption of straight-line method instead of percentage completion method, provided for roadways, power and similar ERI projects, can be used to reduce litigation and increase clarity.

Additionally, any other specific guidelines/clarifications needed with respect to taxation of income and manner of claiming deduction of expenses.

Ask #5: Offering settlement scheme to resolve past tax disputes arising from differential treaty interpretations

The Supreme Court’s decision in the Nestle SA case has had wide ramifications on treaty interpretation and various treaty benefits historically availed. A key takeaway from the ruling is the necessity for specific notifications from the tax policy administration under the act, to implement treaty protocols, especially in the context of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause.

The tax policy administration has started releasing specific guidelines regarding the interpretation of protocols to treaties between India and other countries, which will be implemented in future transactions, promoting clarity and consistency in treaty interpretation.

However, recognising the need to provide certainty and resolution for present cases where lower rate has already been claimed, the tax policy administration should consider establishing guidelines under a settlement scheme, which may provide one-time window to make voluntary tax payments of differential taxes, without interest or penalty. This initiative would offer relief and certainty to taxpayers, while facilitating efficient tax collection.

Ask #6: Optimising indirect tax cost for the green hydrogen sector

Currently, indirect tax has become a major cost component for Green Hydrogen (GH) sector in two ways. First, the customs duty paid on the import of solar modules or solar cells used in setting up solar power plants for supplying renewable energy to GH plant. Second, the loss of GST input pertaining to all procurements made by solar/wind power plant in setting up the unit, as the output electricity is exempt.

The electricity supply by a solar/wind power plant to a GH unit should be considered as deemed export, so that the solar/wind power plant is eligible to claim refund of input GST, which then does not become a cost for the GH unit. Alternatively, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) should also allow direct refund of the GST paid on all capital goods, inputs and input services used in generating power to solar/wind power plants, with the condition that output electricity is supplied exclusively to a GH unit.

For customs duty, the CBIC should provide upfront exemption from a 40 percent basic customs duty on the import of solar modules, with specified end-use condition of using such solar power plant for supplying electricity exclusively to a GH project, or provide the benefit of project import with concessional basic customs duty of 7.5 percent on solar power plant or solar power project, being set-up for supply of electricity exclusively to GH project.

Policy recommendations and expected impact/outcome

Recommendation #1

Hydrogen purchase obligation for sectors such as refinery and fertiliser to drive domestic demand. This would provide the necessary fillip to the sector similar to the renewable purchase obligation.

Recommendation #2

Considering the contribution of the aviation sector to carbon emissions, an incentive programme for production of sustainable aviation fuel could be considered by the government. This would help reduce emissions from the aviation sector.",https://media.deloitte.com/is/image/deloitte/promo-image-global-trade-advisory-tax-1920x880:1200-x-627,N,,2026-01-08 09:57:19.679212

It’s a rare career progression among corporate sustainability professionals, but Birkett Rakow argues it should be more common because CSOs and CEOs share a common challenge: creating business value while navigating systems change.

“Fundamentally, the definition of sustainability is durability,” she said during the latest episode of our Climate Pioneers interview series. “It’s being here and being successful for a long time.”

Hawaiian celebrated its 96th anniversary in 2025, making it one of the oldest U.S. airlines. It was acquired by Alaska Air in September 2024, and Birkett Rakow was closely involved with the integration planning as part of the executive committee led by her boss, Alaska Air CEO Ben Minicucci. She was named to Hawaiian’s board when the integration was completed, ahead of her promotion. Her mission: build on the airlines’ investments in sustainable aviation fuel and efficiency measures, such as local sourcing, to position the combined company for low-carbon business growth.

“Knowing climate science is a real asset, increasingly, for chief sustainability officers, but not just knowing that science, knowing how to translate it into business integration and business outcomes and into initiatives that will actually drive impact,” she said. “I think the duality of that experience is also really important.”

Birkett Rakow’s long-time experience in public affairs and community relations was also a key factor in her promotion to CEO one year later. Before her experience at Alaska Air, she worked on public health policy in the U.S. Senate and in corporate roles at Group Health and Kaiser Permanente (which bought Group Health in 2017).

“One of the things that has always been part of my career is working with multiple stakeholders to get to a solution,” she said. “You can’t go off in a corner and come up with a piece of legislation and expect that it’s going to get done, partly because no one person has all the answers.”

Airline CEOs love fuel efficiency

Birkett Rakow remains accountable for Alaska Air’s overall sustainability strategy and for Alaska Star Ventures, created four years ago, and the work to reduce emissions across the airlines’ operations is top of mind in both her roles. One of the combined company’s environmental goals (adopted from Alaska Air’s sustainability playbook) is to be the most fuel-efficient premium U.S. airline, a title it already claims.

Alaska Air cut 6.4 million gallons of jet fuel in 2024; almost half that amount came from a procedure that requires planes to taxi to runways using just one engine before turning both on for takeoff. It saved 900,000 gallons by using Flyways, an AI software application Alaska developed in collaboration with Air Space Intelligence. The system optimizes flight path information for dispatchers and pilots in real time, so adjustments can be made on the fly that decrease fuel consumption.

Alaska Air doesn’t publish how much fuel it burns annually, but it used close to 300 million gallons in the first half of 2024. “Fuel that we don’t burn is emissions that we don’t need to create,” Birkett Rakow said. “It’s a win-win for the business, because it also is fuel that we don’t need to pay for.”

Alaska Air’s partnership with Air Space Intelligence inspired the creation of Alaska Star Ventures. “Seeing how technology could be built and serve us in the future started us thinking about the role we should play in enabling that new technology,” Birkett Rakow said. “Some of the role we should play is using it. Some of it is informing its development with our own expertise.”

SAF ambitions

The venture group invests in startups and technologies that support the airlines’ operational efficiency goals, fleet renewal initiatives and the transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For example, Alaska Air in August 2024 funded JetZero, which is developing a blended wing aircraft design designed to burn 50 percent less fuel than current planes.

Alaska Air has funded several SAF companies, with the goal of building supplies for its hubs in Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest. For example, Hawaiian and Alaska will receive the first SAF deliveries in the first quarter made from locally grown Camelina crops through its partnership with Par Hawaii and Pono Energy. Alaska is investing in carbontech company Twelve through a venture with Microsoft and others in Washington state, the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator. It is also backing a new Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund that aims to scale commercial availability of sustainable aviation fuel. To build awareness with customers, Alaska Air awards elite qualifying miles to flyers who buy SAF credits.

SAF production is building slowly, and it will take a combination of definitive airline purchasing commitments, policy development and customer engagement to accelerate commercial availability. Alaska Air’s corporate customers including Autodesk, Meta, Microsoft, Skanska, Watershed and We are buying into the mission

“It’s really exciting, but it’s going to take time,” Birkett Rakow said. “I think a couple of years ago with SAF, we thought if we just created … demand signals, if we just purchase SAF, the market will grow. I think there was some rationale to that, but it hasn’t worked in part because the regulatory environment hasn’t been consistently supportive in a way that was probably required for that to happen, and the cost of building new technologies and new production and the capital needed to stand that up is very significant.”",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/trellis_climate_pioneers_diana_birkett_rakow_feature_image_1470x894.png,N,,2026-01-08 09:57:24.842402

Corteva Inc. and bp have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to form a joint venture (JV) focused on producing biofuel feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The JV plans to scale production to deliver one million metric tons per year of SAF feedstocks by the mid-2030s.

Corteva will contract with farmers in North America, South America, and Europe to grow proprietary mustard seed, sunflower, and canola feedstocks suited for SAF production.

The collaboration aligns with global SAF mandates, such as the EU requirement for 20% SAF content in aviation fuel by 2035, rising to 70% by 2050.

Definitive agreements are expected to be finalized in 2025, with operations targeted to begin later that year.

Addressing Growing Demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Corteva and bp announced their shared intent to form a joint venture aimed at producing biofuel feedstocks to meet increasing global demand for SAF. With aviation sector decarbonization becoming a focus of government mandates and incentives, the proposed JV aims to contribute to achieving these sustainability goals.

The EU, for example, has mandated a minimum of 20% SAF content in aviation fuel by 2035, with the target rising to 70% by 2050. Similar incentives are emerging globally, creating opportunities for scaling SAF feedstock production.

Leveraging Agricultural and Energy Expertise

Under the collaboration, Corteva plans to work with farmers across the Americas and Europe to grow proprietary crops such as mustard seed, sunflower, and canola. These crops are designed to meet sustainability criteria under EU RED III standards and qualify for U.S. low-carbon intensity policy incentives. The initiative also introduces new cropping systems to generate revenue for farmers while supporting sustainable practices.

Brook Cunningham, Corteva’s Chief Strategy Officer, commented: “This partnership shows that agriculture can play a vital role in addressing global decarbonization goals. By leveraging Corteva’s technology, scale, and grower relationships, we look forward to supporting the European airline industry while offering farmers new income streams.”

bp will contribute its expertise in refining and trading to optimize the supply chain for SAF production.

Emma Delaney, bp’s executive vice president for customers & products, stated: “We see significant potential in partnering with Corteva. Together, we are positioned to create value by combining Corteva’s agricultural innovations with bp’s refining capabilities.”

Path to Commercialization

The JV envisions progressively scaling up feedstock production, with the goal of delivering one million metric tons annually of biofuel feedstocks by the mid-2030s. This feedstock will support SAF production at bp’s facilities, with plans to finalize agreements by 2025 and begin operations later that year.

By Amber Bryan

In 2023, each paying passenger flying on planes around the world emitted 84.4 grams of CO₂ per kilometre. A study, however, co-led by the University of Oxford, has found three ways of mitigating such emissions and potentially reducing them by up to 75 per cent. These include operating only the most fuel-efficient aircraft, removing premium-class seating to carry more passengers, and raising passenger loads to 95 per cent. In addition, the study shows that an immediate reduction of 11 per cent could be achieved simply by using the most efficient aircraft.

The Boeing 787-9, used for long-haul flights, and the Airbus A321neo, used for short and medium-haul flights, are the most carbon-effective planes. Replacing all aircraft with these would result in fuel savings of 25–28 per cent, according to the study.

Business and first-class seating are five times more CO2-intensive than economy class. By increasing passenger capacity to maximum for the most efficient aircraft, emissions would further reduce by 22-57 per cent. The average aircraft passenger occupancy in 2023 was 79 per cent. By increasing this to 95 per cent, emissions would reduce by 16 per cent.

The study was published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment and involved analysing more than 27 million commercial flights in 2023, covering 26,000 city pairs and nearly 3.5 billion passengers. Some routes were found to be producing nearly 900 grams of CO2 per kilometre for each passenger – which is almost 30 times higher than the most efficient (around 30 grams of CO₂ per kilometre).

The study was based on data from Airline Data, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, and the International Air Transport Association. The regions with the most inefficient flights were Africa, Oceania, the Middle East, Central Asia, and North America. However, the most effective regions were Brazil, India and Southeast Asia.

The researchers suggest efficiency improvements could be promoted using marketing tools, similar to those used for household appliances and vehicles. For example, emissions ratings, adjusted landing fees and carbon intensity caps.

Lead author and Professor at Linnaeus University, Stefan Gössling, said: ‘Efficiency-based policies have a great potential to curb aviation emissions, and can be in airlines’ own economic interest. But the reality is that many airlines continue to fly with old aircraft, low passenger occupancies, and growing proportions of premium-class seating.’

Co-author and Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Dr Milan Klöwer said: ‘While economically and practically unfeasible to replace all older aircraft short term, this analysis shows the potential more efficient aircraft have in comparison to other efficiency gains. Realistically, this would be a long-term transition – one that could be promoted by policies that reward efficiency, so that the most efficient aircraft are favoured whenever replacement decisions are made.’

How to choose low-carbon flights

While airlines themselves may not make the changes needed to reduce global aviation emissions, there are some things that passengers can be conscious of to reduce their own carbon footprint when flying.

Different models of aircraft determine engine type and fuel efficiency. Age is also a factor, as newer models have better fuel economy. The carbon footprint of a flight is worked out per person. This means the more people on a flight, the more people share that flight’s total carbon footprint.

The route taken can also make a difference. Direct flights rather than layovers reduce carbon emissions, as take-off and landing use much more fuel than cruising at altitude – as well as the fact that the route will take longer if it stops off. Also, ensuring the airline you’re flying with is using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is another way to choose a low-carbon flight.

Greenland holds vast but hard-to-access mineral and fossil-fuel riches, driving renewed US interest and Donald Trump’s threats to annex the Danish territory, which Denmark warns could spell the end of the NATO alliance. The island, roughly the size of the Democratic Republic of Congo, contains “critical” and rare-earth minerals needed for the national security of certain countries and the energy transition, with global demand for such resources expected to quadruple by 2040.

Yet only about 20% of Greenland is ice‑free. There are no intercity roads, and for every 100 mineral exploration projects, only one may become a mine, making development slow, risky, and capital‑intensive. Past mines left heavy metal pollution still detectable 50 years later, fueling public skepticism.

Oil prices falls after Trump’s statements on Venezuelan oil

Oil fell for a second day as Trump’s deal to import up to $2 billion of Venezuelan crude signalled higher U.S. supplies, with Brent down 1.2% to $59.96 per barrel and WTI (West Texas Intermediate) off 2% to $55.99 per barrel. Trump said Venezuela will be “turning over between 30 million and 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil” to the U.S., likely rerouted from China, keeping crude “on the defensive,” according to BOK Financial’s

The U.S. also seized an empty Russian‑flagged Venezuela‑linked tanker as part of its broader control over Caracas’ exports after Maduro’s capture, which Venezuelan officials call a “kidnapping.” Data from the U.S. EIA (Energy Information Administration) showed a 3.8 million‑barrel drop in U.S. crude stocks versus expectations for a 447,000‑barrel build, but gasoline and distillates rose 7.7 million and 5.6 million barrels, respectively.

Venezuela’s Merey crude is selling at about $22 below Brent, and BMI warns that cheap flows could “raise the expected price of oil over the medium term” if the regime endures.

The promise of electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft has captured headlines and imagination, yet both technologies face fundamental barriers that limit their near-term viability for commercial aviation. Electric aircraft confront the harsh reality of battery energy density constraints. Current lithium-ion technology achieves approximately 200 to 250 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg), with expectations to plateau at around 300 Wh/kg due to fundamental chemistry limitations, compared to 12,000 Wh/kg for jet fuel. However, studies have identified that electric aviation would require 400 Wh/kg for general aviation applications and 750 Wh/kg for commercial regional air service, representing a two- to three-fold improvement that remains beyond current capabilities. While electric aircraft may serve a role on short-haul regional routes, their energy density limitations constrain their applicability to the majority of commercial aviation.

The infrastructure implications are equally daunting. Electric aviation would necessitate comprehensive airport charging systems, overhauls of electrical grid capacity, and aircraft redesign. To date, not a single commercial electric aircraft deployment has occurred in scheduled passenger service, underscoring the technological and economic hurdles that remain.

Hydrogen propulsion presents similar challenges. While hydrogen offers impressive energy density by weight, its storage requirements create significant design constraints. Liquid hydrogen must be maintained at -253 degrees Celsius, requiring specialized cryogenic storage systems that fundamentally alter aircraft architecture. The safety considerations, airport infrastructure modifications and lengthy recertification processes have proven so challenging that even Airbus recently scaled back its hydrogen aircraft program timeline.

These realities underscore that electric and hydrogen technologies will require significant technological breakthroughs before their full potential can be realized, highlighting the aviation industry’s need for immediate solutions to achieve its decarbonization goals.

SAF: The Drop-In Solution

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) offers a direct path to decarbonization by working within existing systems rather than requiring wholesale transformation. Produced from renewable feedstocks—including alcohols, used cooking oil, animal fats, municipal solid waste, agricultural residues and even captured CO2—SAF can blend with conventional jet fuel without modifying aircraft engines or airport infrastructure.

This compatibility is critical. Airlines operate on thin margins, and aircraft lifecycles span decades. A fuel that integrates with existing fleets enables immediate deployment without the massive capital investments required by alternative technologies.

The market has responded. Global SAF production is projected to reach 6.1 billion to 8.2 billion gallons annually by 2030, according to RMI’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Outlook, up from about 350 million gallons in 2024—underscoring both industry commitment and scalability.

Today’s Leading Pathway

The dominant SAF production technology today is hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), which converts fats, oils and greases into jet fuel through hydrogen treatment. Its appeal lies in compatibility with existing refinery infrastructure, allowing producers to leverage current equipment with modifications.

However, HEFA faces constraints that limit long-term scalability; chief among them is feedstock availability. The U.S. produces about 23 million tons of suitable feedstock annually, with soybean oil accounting for 57% of supply. Used cooking oil is limited by collection logistics, while animal fats are geographically concentrated in states such as Nebraska, Texas and Iowa, increasing transportation costs and carbon intensity.

Competition from the renewable diesel market further complicates HEFA economics, as incentives often favor diesel production and intensify feedstock competition. Maximizing SAF yields also generates substantial naphtha byproducts—up to 25% of total output—which can become a low-value burden for facilities located far from petrochemical markets.

These factors create a complex optimization challenge. HEFA produces only paraffinic components, while conventional jet fuel requires 8% to 25% aromatics for proper engine performance. As a result, HEFA SAF must be blended with fossil jet fuel, limiting its carbon reduction potential. Producers must balance feedstock costs, blending requirements and infrastructure proximity while navigating agricultural commodity volatility.

Innovation in SAF Production

The industry’s response to HEFA’s challenges has been to diversify production pathways and optimize existing processes. Fischer-Tropsch technology, which converts solid waste after gasification into syngas into synthetic fuels, offers access to more abundant feedstocks but at higher capital and operating costs. Alcohol-to-jet pathways provide another alternative, though current processes remain energy-intensive and expensive.

Current ASTM standards limit most SAF pathways to 50% blending with conventional jet fuel. Still, the industry is moving toward higher blend ratios and eventually 100% drop-in synthetic fuels. Achieving this goal requires addressing the aromatic component gap in HEFA SAF production, making economical sources of these molecules crucial for future fuel specifications.

One particularly promising area involves upgrading the naphtha byproducts from HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes into aromatic components of SAF that are otherwise missing from these outputs. Rather than treating these naphtha materials as low-value byproducts, emerging add-on technologies can convert them into high-value aromatics. For example, Universal Fuel Technologies has developed a chemical processing technology that complements HEFA and FT by converting their naphtha byproducts into high-quality aromatic components essential for jet fuel.

The challenge of upgrading naphtha byproducts stems from two key factors: the chemical properties of paraffinic molecules, which make them difficult to convert into aromatics, and the small quantities produced at individual HEFA facilities, which preclude economies of scale. These chemical and economic dual constraints explain why few technologies have emerged to convert this low-value stream into higher-value products. However, this approach not only improves the economics of existing SAF production, but also addresses a critical technical requirement for future 100% SAF blends.

Economic Viability Through Integration

The future of SAF production likely depends on integrated approaches that maximize resource utilization and minimize waste. Rather than viewing each production pathway in isolation, the industry must consider how different technologies can complement each other.

The flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions becomes crucial as well. Feedstock availability and pricing fluctuate in response to agricultural cycles, regulatory changes, and competing demand. Production facilities that can adjust their operations—switching between different feedstocks or product slates based on market conditions—will have significant competitive advantages.

Scaling for Impact

Meeting aviation’s decarbonization goals requires SAF production to scale from hundreds of millions of gallons annually to tens of billions of gallons per year. This expansion demands not only technological improvements but also supply chain development, policy support and effective financing mechanisms. The industry must also develop production technologies that can compete economically with conventional jet fuel while maintaining the performance characteristics that aviation demands. This requires continued innovation in processing technologies, feedstock development and systems integration. In many cases, investors may be reluctant to fund HEFA and FT plants where the naphtha byproduct stream cannot be effectively monetized. Technologies that solve this byproduct utilization challenge become critical enablers, potentially transforming otherwise uneconomical projects into viable investments and accelerating the deployment of SAF production capacity.

An Immediate Path to Sustainable Aviation

While electric and hydrogen aircraft may eventually transform aviation, SAF offers the most viable path to immediate emissions reduction. Unlike alternative propulsion technologies that require fundamental changes to aircraft design and infrastructure, SAF works within existing systems while delivering measurable environmental benefits.

The industry’s commitment to sustainability is clear, yet progress depends on solutions that can be deployed at scale. SAF provides that bridge, linking today’s fossil fuel reliance with a fully sustainable aviation future. By advancing production technologies that address current economic and technical barriers, the industry can accelerate SAF adoption while moving toward the goal of 100% SAF.

The facility is owned and run by its long-time partner Sekisui Chemical Co. Ltd. and has demonstrated the feasibility of converting mixed waste into ethanol at a near-commercial scale, reports The Globe And Mail.

The pilot plant, built at one-tenth of a full commercial size, can produce about 400 tonnes of ethanol each year. It remained in operation for nearly four years after mechanical completion in April 2022. During this time, the plant showed that LanzaTech’s fermentation technology can reliably handle mixed, non-recyclable waste that would otherwise be sent to landfills or incinerators. The ability to manage uneven and changing waste streams is seen as important for supporting circular use of carbon resources across different regions.

The project was funded through investments by SBR, a joint venture between Sekisui Chemical and INCJ, a public-private investment fund overseen by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Financial support was also provided by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment.

According to the company, the plant met all its guaranteed performance targets and sustained ethanol production above guaranteed levels for more than 14 consecutive days after reaching stable operations. This marked the most productive fermentation period achieved at the site so far, even while operating with challenging gas conditions.

The facility processed synthesis gas made up of carbon monoxide and hydrogen in varying proportions that are generally difficult for many technologies to handle. Despite this, ethanol output remained steady, highlighting the flexibility and strength of the fermentation process.

Gasification is a commonly used method for treating solid waste, and LanzaTech has previously combined its fermentation system with established gasifier technologies.

The EU Innovation Fund has selected 61 projects for funding

The EU Innovation Fund was established to advance innovative energy projects that could reshape the global energy industry as the need to diversify energy output across the world intensifies. Towards the end of last year, the Innovation Fund identified 61 projects across Europe that will receive funding.

Five Finnish projects were selected as part of the 61 approved applications. Finland has become a progressive nation thanks to its ambitions to increase renewable biofuel production through several projects being led by market-leading companies in Europe.

Renewable biofuel and diesel play an important role in decarbonizing the global energy market

Over the past few years, it has become abundantly clear to the world that we need to decarbonize the energy market to meet clean energy and emission targets. While the world still needs oil and gas, one method of decarbonization may be to increase biofuel and renewable diesel production.

Neste has now opted to expand its already impressive standing in the European energy market by establishing a co-processing facility for biofuels and renewable diesel at its Porvoo oil refinery in Finland. The company is a market leader in the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel, and has now received the backing of the EU Innovation Fund for its refinery project in Finland.

“Switching to renewable diesel is a cost-effective and straightforward process aiming to enhance sustainability. This fuel is fully compatible with existing diesel storage tanks, fueling equipment and vehicles eliminating the need for expensive new infrastructure.” – Advanced BioFuels USA

Neste aims to develop an entirely new co-processing technology in Finland

The company has some lofty ambitions for the Finnish project. Neste aims to establish an entirely new co-processing technology at its Porvoo oil refinery in Finland. SCOOP will make use of crude tall oil to produce vast amounts of sustainable biofuels as well as renewable diesel for the regional market.

Thanks to the significant funding allocation from the EU Innovation Fund, the project is now seen as strategically important for the European continent and may pave the way forward for other nations to follow suit and develop new, innovative projects that will deliver vast amounts of energy while not placing the climate in peril.

Crude tall oil is a residue created at mills from the use of pine wood, which mostly goes to waste. Neste aims to develop an all-new technology to process said residue and use it to create biofuels and renewable diesel, which will help Neste’s customers reduce their carbon footprint.

As several energy-rich nations aim to increase petrochemical production over the coming years, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the market is in a constant state of evolution as nations and companies aim to meet clean energy and emission reduction targets by the end of the decade.

Neste is fostering a new era of decarbonization for the industry

The need to diversify the energy market is only matched by the challenge it faces in securing funding for innovative projects that will reshape the global industry.

In an update to its 2025 airline industry financial outlook, released at its AGM in New Delhi, India, IATA predicted industry net profits of USD36.0 billion, improved from the USD32.4 billion earned in 2024.
The projected net profit margin at 3.7% is an improvement from the 3.4% earned in 2024 and up 0.1pp on the previously projected 3.6%.
As 2023 begins, CAPA presents a snapshot of the global airline industry in 15 numbers.
Read on to assess the state of the airline industry in 15 numbers.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) anticipates improved airline profitability for 2025 and resilience in the face of continued global economic and political shifts. However, its projections represent a fall in net profits on its previous released numbers, but margins are expected to increase.

In an update to its 2025 airline industry financial outlook, released at its AGM in New Delhi, India, IATA predicted industry net profits of USD36.0 billion, improved from the USD32.4 billion earned in 2024. This is slightly down on the previously projected USD36.6 billion (Dec-2024).

The projected net profit margin at 3.7% is an improvement from the 3.4% earned in 2024 and up 0.1pp on the previously projected 3.6%. Return on invested capital at 6.7%, is also an improvement from the 6.6% earned in 2024, but largely unchanged from previous projections.

Operating profits at USD66.0 billion, are also an improvement from an estimated USD61.9 billion in 2024, but down from the previously projected USD67.5 billion.

The standout projection though is that the industry will not exceed the anticipated USD1 trillion revenues, albeit will still hit record annual levels. Total revenues are projected to reach USD979 billion (+1.3% on 2024). Total expenses will hit USD913 billion (+1.0% on 2024, but below the previously projected USD940 billion).

Total traveller numbers will also reach a record high but will again miss a key milestone. An anticipated 4% rise over 2024 will bring annual passenger traffic to 4.99 billion for 2025, a revision from the 5.22 billion projection from the end of 2024.

Total air cargo volumes will follow the same trend reaching 69 million tonnes, up 0.6% on 2024, but below the previously projected 72.5 million tonnes.

2024 was a historic year for the aviation industry, as global passenger traffic finally achieved a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels, supported by continued strong travel demand.

This strong demand coupled with restricted capacity drove higher load factors and impacted consumers in the form of higher airfares.

Airlines benefited from lower fuel prices, but non-fuel costs generally increased across the board.

These market dynamics are expected to help keep airline operating profits at historically high levels.

Supply chain issues remained a major restriction on industry growth throughout the year, headlined by aircraft delivery delays and significant additional engine maintenance requirements.

Airlines were particularly impacted by being unable to introduce new aircraft as planned, limiting their growth potential, increasing the average fleet age, hampering efforts to improve efficiency and cut emissions, and driving greater demand and costs for maintenance and aircraft leasing.

Service providers to airlines were among the major beneficiaries of the supply chain problems, with many lessors and MRO providers reporting high demand and record financial performance.

As 2023 begins, CAPA presents a snapshot of the global airline industry in 15 numbers.

Based on a presentation given at CAPA's World Aviation Summit in Gibraltar in Dec-2022, with updated numbers as appropriate, this graphic report summarises a range of key aviation metrics.

It paints a picture of an industry recovering from a period when it faced the most serious challenges ever encountered.

In the three years 2020-2022 the world's airlines lost 80% of the industry's all-time accumulated profit of all previous years.

Yet, capacity and traffic have made significant steps towards recovering 2019 levels, and there has been no net reduction in the number of airlines over the past three years.

The Global Biofuels Alliance, strengthened by our new Global Biofuel Champion Fellowship to nurture young scientists, stands at the forefront of this shift.
The Global South has proven that biofuels are a sophisticated, high-tech, and socially inclusive pathway to Net Zero.","In the race to decarbonize the global economy, the world often finds itself paralyzed by a search for perfection. We wait for battery technologies that do not yet exist at scale, or for green hydrogen infrastructure that is decades away from ubiquity. But last month at COP30, amidst the backdrop of the Amazon, a different narrative emerged—one grounded not in future miracles, but in immediate, scalable reality.

The message from Belem is clear: We cannot afford to wait. And we don’t have to.

Brazil, leveraging its presidency of the climate talks, introduced the “Belem 4X Pledge,” a bold commitment to quadruple the global use of sustainable fuels by 2035. While nations debate the politics of pledges, the GBA is already building the technical scaffold to make ambitions, targets, pledges, and commitments a reality. We see biofuels not as a “bridge technology,” but as a destination—a critical, permanent pillar of a just energy transition.

For too long, the debate on bioenergy has been stifled by the “food versus fuel” myth. Critics argue that growing crops for energy threatens global food security. However, data shared at our high-level roundtables dismantles this zero-sum thinking. In Brazil, fifty years of ethanol production have coincided with record food output. Modern biofuel production is circular; the by-products of corn ethanol, such as distillers’ grains, serve as high-protein animal feed, actually supporting food systems rather than competing with them.

The urgency of this shift is most visible in the sectors we call “hard-to-abate.” Consider shipping and aviation. While electric vehicles are transforming road transport, batteries cannot fly a jumbo jet across the Atlantic or power a container ship across the Pacific. Here, biofuels are the only commercially viable, drop-in solution available today.

The maritime sector is already pivoting. Data presented at COP30 reveals that 50 percent of new ship orders are now capable of using alternative fuels. Unlike hydrogen or ammonia, which require massive new infrastructure and safety overhauls, sustainable biofuels can decarbonize the existing global fleet immediately.

Yet, barriers remain. As noted in the GBA’s new whitepaper released at the summit, “Green Fuels for Blue Skies,” Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) currently costs three to four times more than conventional jet fuel. Airlines cannot bridge this gap alone. We need harmonized global policies—blending mandates, book-and-claim systems, and tax incentives—to drive costs down and production up. We also need to harmonize sustainability standards so that a litre of SAF produced in the Global South is recognized and valued the same way in Europe or Asia.

Perhaps most importantly, the bioenergy revolution is a matter of equity. The energy transition cannot just be about Teslas in California; it must be about clean cooking in Kenya. Today, 2.4 billion people still breathe toxic smoke from cooking with wood and charcoal. Bioethanol offers a clean, localized solution that improves health and empowers women. Initiatives like the KOKO Networks in Kenya demonstrate that when we treat biofuels as a tool for development, we can solve the climate crisis and the energy poverty crisis simultaneously.

The Global Biofuels Alliance, strengthened by our new Global Biofuel Champion Fellowship to nurture young scientists, stands at the forefront of this shift. We are moving from diplomatic pledges to implementation.

The Global South has proven that biofuels are a sophisticated, high-tech, and socially inclusive pathway to Net Zero. The technology is ready. The feedstock is available. The only missing ingredient is the political will to standardize our markets and finance the scale-up.

We have the tools to clean our skies and oceans today. Let us not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.",https://etedge-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/default-article-banner.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 22:56:23.714866

For companies managing large shipping networks, indirect greenhouse-gas emissions—particularly those classified as GHG Protocol’s Scope 3—represent both the greatest challenge and the greatest opportunity. Scope 3 encompasses all indirect emissions (i.e., emissions that aren’t directly produced by the company of origin but are produced by other organizations in their supply chain) that result from the beginning of the corporate value chain to the end, from transportation to distribution and the final use of sold products.

As a global company serving over 220 countries, DHL relies on an extensive network outside of our own organization, which makes tracking and minimizing Scope 3 shipping emissions an imperative part of our sustainability initiative. Regardless of scale, however, tracking is important for businesses of every size.

Why Scope 3 matters for your shipping network

While Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (purchased energy) are important, for logistics providers and shippers alike, Scope 3 frequently comprises the majority of the carbon footprint — up to 80-90%.

For a shipping network, Scope 3 includes:

Emissions from upstream activities (e.g., procurement of packaging materials, inbound transport).

Emissions from downstream distribution (e.g., onward transport, customer delivery, returns).

Emissions embedded in third-party logistics providers or carrier services.

Tracking Scope 3 is vital because:

It enables you to identify the biggest lever for decarbonization in your supply chain and network.

It allows you to respond to regulatory and customer demand for transparency. 66% of respondents say that they consider sustainability when making a purchase, so responsible carbon reporting is increasingly important.

It gives you a data-driven foundation for setting reduction targets, differentiating on green credentials and building competitive advantage.

Step-by-step: How to track Scope 3 emissions across your shipping network

How do you get started with measuring Scope 3 emissions and implementing a supply chain decarbonization plan? Let’s break it down into four actionable steps.

Step 1: Measure your footprint and set targets

Inventory all emissions sources across your network (inbound, outbound, warehousing, returns).

Use standard frameworks such as the GHG Protocol to classify and quantify Scope 3. AI for emissions tracking in logistics is also an increasingly useful tool.

Where exact data is unavailable, use estimation methods or benchmarking to fill gaps (e.g., carrier vehicles, air vs. sea freight, packaging).

Establish measurable reduction targets for your network (e.g., “reduce downstream delivery emissions by 20% by 2030”).

Step 2: Secure resources & stakeholder buy-in

Engage your carriers, logistics partners and internal departments (procurement, operations, sustainability) to align on data sharing.

Invest in analytics tools, dashboards and data capture systems that enable visibility across network nodes (transport modes, carriers, packaging).

Ensure budget and governance are in place — tracking emissions across a complex network requires dedicated effort.

Step 3: Implement tracking systems and reduction strategies

Map the shipping network: origin-to-destination flows, transport modes, intermediaries, packaging types, returns flows.

For each segment, capture data such as distance, mode (road, rail, sea, air), load factor, fuel type, packaging weight and material.

Use carriers and providers who disclose their fuel usage, electrification status or use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) if airfreight. For example, our GoGreen Plus shipping option uses SAF and helps reduce shipping emissions.

Build a dashboard that aggregates all this data, segments it by upstream vs downstream, by carrier, by mode, by packaging, and tracks your baseline vs target.

Don’t forget reverse logistics: returns increase emissions. DHL advises reducing returns and using parcel-lockers or optimized return flows.

Leverage trends and innovations: route optimization, green packaging, EV fleets and other sustainable freight solutions, etc.

Step 4: Monitor progress, review & communicate

Regularly benchmark performance and track trend lines.

Review which carriers, modes, packaging types or regions are under-performing? Where are the greatest reduction opportunities?

Use the measurements to inform procurement: select partners based on sustainability credentials (e.g., green packaging, EV fleets, SAF adoption). Provide transparent communication to customers, stakeholders, regulators. Shipping and logistics emissions reporting is an increasingly important part of fortifying brand image and building trust

Why choosing the right logistics partner matters

Your choice of logistics provider is not just about cost and speed. It’s also about emissions transparency, sustainable transport modes, carrier data access and packaging innovation. DHL has strategies and toolkits in place to help you actively and effectively reduce your company’s carbon footprint, including Scope 3 emissions.

For example, our GoGreen Plus shipping option uses Sustainable Aviation Fuel, allowing you to increase the impact of your sustainability initiatives in a way that works for your journey. GoGreen Plus also makes tracking your emissions reductions easy by providing a detailed emissions report and a CO2e reduction certificate.

Because so many moving parts and partners are involved, tracking Scope 3 emissions across a shipping network is complex, but it’s also where the largest sustainability gains lie. For B2B logistics operations, the opportunity to measure, manage and reduce these emissions translates into cost savings, risk mitigation, brand value and competitive advantage.

By integrating your shipping network’s data with a partner that shares your sustainability ambition, tracking and reducing Scope 3 becomes far more attainable.

At DHL, we believe that with the right tools, partner alignment, and data-driven strategy, your organization can turn what seems like an indirect, intangible challenge into a measurable, manageable pathway to a greener future.

Caption The gasification furnace in Chiba (Provided by JFE Engineering Corp.)","CHIBA--JFE Engineering Corp. started a pilot operation on what it says is the world’s only furnace that can turn household waste into synthetic gas for use in creating plastics and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The small gasification furnace was built within the premises of JFE Steel Corp.’s East Japan Works in Chiba city.

The furnace injects oxygen into household and industrial waste, and uses the waste’s own heat to drive a reaction that produces synthetic gas composed mainly of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

The resulting gas can be used as a raw material for plastics and SAF, the company said.

This technology is called “chemical recycling,” in which waste is chemically decomposed and returned it to its molecular-level raw state.

It differs from “material recycling,” which physically reverts plastic bottles back into raw material.

Chemical recycling also requires significantly less energy and releases far fewer carbon dioxide than “thermal recycling,” which burns waste to generate heat energy.

In the trial operation that began in December, JFE’s goal is to stably produce synthetic gas and establish a chemical recycling technology that can be economically self-sustaining.

“By redefining the concept of waste, this technology will push green innovation in the manufacturing industry to a new stage,” Susumu Ayukawa, a director of JFE Engineering, said.

The trial operation will continue until June 2026. The waste used will be accepted mainly from Chiba city.

The facility has the capacity to process up to 20 tons of waste per day. A large-scale verification test capable of processing 150 tons daily is planned for fiscal 2029.

In Japan, municipal incineration plants are aging and final disposal sites are in short supply while demand for recycling continues to grow.

JFE Engineering is in discussions with chemical manufacturers to start a chemical recycling business by the end of fiscal 2030.

Successfully operated on complex syngas streams with CO + H ₂ contents as low as 40%

Demonstrated robust waste-to-ethanol process under varying feedstock conditions

SKOKIE, Ill., Jan. 07, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA), a leader in industrial carbon recycling, has announced successful operational results at the municipal solid waste (MSW) to ethanol pilot plant in Kuji City, Iwate, Japan owned and operated by longstanding partner, SEKISUI CHEMICAL CO., LTD. (TSE: 4204) (SEKISUI). This 1/10th commercial scale facility, with the capacity to produce approximately 400 tons of ethanol per year, operated for nearly four years following mechanical completion in April 2022. Throughout this period, the plant demonstrated that LanzaTech’s gas fermentation platform can reliably process highly inhomogeneous, unsorted mixed non-recyclable waste streams—materials that would otherwise be destined for landfill or incineration. The demonstrated ability to manage challenging and variable waste sources is especially significant, as it shows that the technology can adapt to diverse regional waste profiles and support the development of a global circular carbon economy.

The waste-to-ethanol plant was funded with investment by SBR, a joint venture between Sekisui Chemical and INCJ, a private-public fund overseen by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI). It also received funding from the Japanese Ministry of the Environment.

The plant achieved its guaranteed performance, sustaining specific ethanol yields above guaranteed values for over 14 consecutive days after reaching steady state - making this the most productive fermentation campaign at the site to date. Notably, the ethanol yield was maintained above guaranteed performance despite operating on particularly challenging gas mixtures. The plant processed syngas (a blend of carbon monoxide and hydrogen) with a combined CO + H ₂ content ranging from 40% to 55%, and an H ₂ :CO ratio between 1.1 and 1.4, a balance that can be especially demanding for other catalytic technologies. To put this in context, achieving high performance under these conditions is akin to running a marathon at high altitude; it demonstrates both the adaptability and resilience of the LanzaTech process.

Gasification is a widely used and established technology for processing solid waste streams, with LanzaTech having successfully integrated its fermentation platform with several proven, traditional gasifier systems. The project at Kuji provided an opportunity to collaborate on a novel gasifier design, underscoring both the value of ongoing innovation in waste conversion technologies and the adaptability of LanzaTech’s fermentation process. Even with varied feed gas conditions, the process not only remained robust but also met key performance targets, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of LanzaTech’s platform.

“We are immensely proud of what we’ve achieved together at our Japan demonstration facility,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech. “Our sincere thanks go to our partner Sekisui Chemical and the prefecture of Iwate and the city of Kuji for their outstanding collaboration and support. The results at Kuji once again demonstrate the scalability and technical viability of our fermentation platform. We are also grateful to the Government of Japan for its continued support and investment in sustainable technologies. We look forward to building on this progress and expanding sustainable fuels and chemicals in Japan and beyond.”

LanzaTech remains committed to advancing waste-to-energy solutions that are essential for a circular economy and that create valuable feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel and other chemicals. By turning challenging waste streams into critical resources, projects like this help enable low-carbon industries and accelerate the global transition to more sustainable fuels.

SAF, which the aviation industry predicts could reduce emissions by up to 70%, only accounts for 0.8% of jet fuel.
“In the future, we do know we won’t have enough SAF to make a real dent in emissions from air transport,” he said.
The Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A321neo burn up to 25% less fuel than older models, reducing both emissions and operating costs.
That’s due to more inefficient aircraft, air traffic control issues, and planes that are less than 90% full.","Airlines could immediately cut carbon emissions by as much as 50% by taking just three steps: eliminating premium seating, flying newer aircraft, and maximizing seat occupancy, according to a new study that analyzed more than 27 million flights.

Thinking in these terms is an important shift from reliance on sustainable aviation fuel, according to Stefan Gössling, professor of Tourism Research at Linnaeus University, who led the study.

SAF, which the aviation industry predicts could reduce emissions by up to 70%, only accounts for 0.8% of jet fuel. Projections are that there won’t be enough for airlines to meet their 2050 net-zero goal.

Gössling said that achieving the reductions his study identified would lower passenger comfort but could mean that the SAF available could make a difference.

“In the future, we do know we won’t have enough SAF to make a real dent in emissions from air transport,” he said. “If air transport fuel demand doubles, following these three points, it makes it far more likely we can move closer towards using SAF in the future.”

Are Airlines Flying Inefficiently?

The Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A321neo burn up to 25% less fuel than older models, reducing both emissions and operating costs. But the growth in flight numbers means the sector’s total emissions keep rising.

One source of inefficiency: Premium seating configurations. Removing them would reduce the amount of emissions per passenger.

“That means we can transport more people on the same flight, meaning we can go to the same destinations with the same amount of people,” Gössling said.

But airlines are increasingly retrofitting cabins with more premium seats in order to meet rising demand. They have seen a surge in demand for premium tickets from leisure travelers in the past five years, and it’s a trend that shows no sign of slowing down.

For example, United Airlines executives said during an earnings call in 2025 that premium cabin revenues were increasing by 5.6% year-over-year, and that the airline planned to invest more in premium capacity in the coming years.

U.S. Flights Lag Behind Global Efficiency

The research found that the United States, which accounts for a quarter of all aviation emissions, operated flights that were 14% more polluting than the global average.

That’s due to more inefficient aircraft, air traffic control issues, and planes that are less than 90% full.

Atlanta and New York were among the airports with the least efficient flights overall, according to the study: They were almost 50% worse than airports like Abu Dhabi and Madrid.

China, the second biggest aviation polluter, had flight efficiencies slightly above the global average. The UK, the world’s third biggest air travel polluter, was slightly below average.

Industry Response

IATA, which represents most airlines and has set the sector’s decarbonization goals, said progress toward its climate goals will come from deploying SAF and using carbon credits. It added that backlogs of new aircraft have resulted in carriers using older, less efficient planes.

“Airlines have a strong self-interest to reduce fuel burn and maximize load factors, the latter is now at a record 84%,” Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president sustainability and chief economist, told Skift.

“However, supply-chain failures have caused an aircraft order backlog of over 5,000 planes, stalling habitual annual fuel-efficiency gains. Real progress lies in building new energy markets, as the world did regarding wind and solar.”

According to LinkedIn, between 501 and 1,000 people work at Hacienda Alsacia, from farmers to customer service staff, making it a mid-sized employer in the region.
As the company’s first wholly-owned coffee farm, the site is a model for other large international coffee companies to follow.","The opportunity was exclusively available to SkyMiles Members and kicked off Delta’s Group Drop on SkyMiles Experiences — a “ new way for SkyMiles Members to access unforgettable events with a group of friends, zero miles needed,” as the brand puts it.

The In-Air Coffeehouse flight departed from the far end of the international terminal at Atlanta-Hartsfield Jackson International Airport following a pre-party that included far more excitement than I’m used to at 9 AM on a Tuesday. We heard the revelry as we approached the gate, which had been tricked out with a makeshift Starbucks coffee bar and deep-green flora evoking the mood of Costa Rica’s tropical environs. Mimosas flowed freely among the 150 or so travelers gathered for the charter flight.

The new experiential perk also coincided with Delta’s 100th anniversary. But back in the terminal, the present took precedence, as did the future. Primarily, what it means to be a part of an airline loyalty program, and what it could mean in the future.

I’d never been on a charter flight before this one. Full disclosure, my travel media career allowed me to bypass the actual sweepstakes, but I still felt like quite the winner as I observed the layman travelers sitting lumpily at the adjacent gate, looking jealously at the early morning shenanigans happening at ours.

The plane itself was a standard Boeing 737 modified for the occasion with faux leather accents and seatback nametags made of burlap coffee sacks. It felt as much like a coffeehouse as economy class could, with the added bonus of empty middle seats. En route, a Starbucks barista led us through a guided tasting of two blends from Hacienda Alsacia, the coffee farm we’d visit in Costa Rica. The mood was revelrous – I’ve never heard such clapping and whooping on a flight. We cheered after the coffee tasting, and again when it was announced that affogatos would be served after lunch. There were multiple rounds of applause for the stewardesses, and even a few claps when the pilot announced the time change as we pulled into the gate in San Jose (something certainly not stirred by the free Imperial beers on board).

Sustainable coffee at Hacienda Alsacia

The next morning, we boarded a bus for Hacienda Alsacia. The farm is in the hills outside of San Jose, overlooking the Central Valley region where some 70 percent of Costa Rica’s 5 million residents live. As we toured the beautiful farm, guides explaining sustainable farming and “safeguarding the future of coffee,” I found myself looking for evidence of corporate greenwashing. Or at least a sense that we were being duped by a giant corporation that buys 3 percent of the world’s coffee from growing regions around the world, yet somehow manages to keep it tasting the same every time.

The farm exists for research and development – nothing grown here is exported out of Costa Rica. The goal is to create coffee plants that are resistant to both climate change and disease, and that use less water and energy. Studies have found that coffee farms will need to move to higher elevations as regions warm, and the threat of diseases like leaf rust (also made worse by climate change) are ever-present and devastating.

Hacienda Alsacia grows a plant resistant to climate change, and blends it with a plant resistant to disease for a durable hybrid. More than 800,000 coffee trees are on the farm, and each of the guests with Delta planted one more on the trip. My wife Alisha was particularly interested in this project as the owner of a boutique heirloom seed company in Colorado. How can sustainable farming practices in Central America be translated to growers in Asia, in the United States, or in the Southern Hemisphere?

It’s easy to blame big corporations for negatively impacting local businesses and communities, and in many cases that finger pointing is justified. When a Starbucks first opened in the small mountain town where I attended college, an angry mob of over-caffeinated locals threw bricks through the windows and publicly vowed never to support the big guy threatening local coffee shops. I didn’t participate in the window smashing, though I agreed with some of the sentiment. I figured that continuing to patronize local cafes was a strong enough vote. Two decades of added wisdom have since taught me that holding big companies to account also means recognizing when they do something right.

Hacienda Alsacia is, from what I gathered during our short time in Costa Rica, a prime example. During a guided tasting of three house blends, we learned about how the R&D farm’s research is open-sourced to growers around the world through the Starbucks Costa Rica Farmer Support Center, one of 10 in coffee growing regions around the globe. It serves as a database of knowledge about how to grow coffee for the future. According to LinkedIn, between 501 and 1,000 people work at Hacienda Alsacia, from farmers to customer service staff, making it a mid-sized employer in the region. As the company’s first wholly-owned coffee farm, the site is a model for other large international coffee companies to follow.

Experiencing a new side of Starbucks

Anyone can visit Hacienda Alsacia and enjoy the unique coffees grown and roasted onsite, and can even watch the roasting happen live while they sip. Our return flight to Atlanta was a regular commercial flight, and I sat next to an American expat who lived in San Jose. He told me when family or friends visit him from back home, he asks if they want to “stop and get a Starbucks” on the way in from the airport, only to detour 40 minutes into the hills to Hacienda Alsacia to treat them to a Starbucks they’ve never tasted, complete with epic mountain views.

At Hacienda Alsacia’s onsite coffeeshop, looking over a waterfall spilling into a canyon below, I spoke with Joshua Kaehler, Delta’s managing director of Loyalty Partnerships, about whether experiences like the In-Air Coffeehouse are going to be more common. I told him I felt that Delta, or really any major airline willing to do so, has a strong opportunity to add memorable moments to the otherwise anxiety-inducing experience of air travel. In the view of this travel editor, knowing something as simple as a good cup of coffee and decent free Wi-Fi await onboard is more than enough to earn my business.

“I think our goal is to figure out what do customers want from brands they care about,” Kaelher says. “We’ve seen really good success so far when we do collaborations on the experiences side with brands that customers know.”

He noted that this means not just more in-air collaborations with Starbucks, but also with services travelers use regularly, such as Uber. These collaborations can help make a full-service experience for Delta flyers that rewards them for choosing Delta and its partners. He emphasized the airline’s focus on establishing itself as the premium American airline, and that it has to maintain that trust with flyers in order to up the ante on experiences. Delta is frequently cited as the most on-time US airline, and has built an image as “premium” for an experience and ticketing process that is more streamlined than budget airlines, though customers pay for that convenience. Some studies have found Delta to be 20 to 40 percent more expensive than these budget carriers.

​​”We wouldn’t have the right to do this if we didn’t run a reliable, careful airline,” Kaelher says. “We’ve spent the last two decades building that and then you sort of can stack these memorable experiences on top of that. It comes back to delivering the core business really well, consistently, and then you have the right to speak about everything else.”

If the goal is for frequent fliers to have a reason to be loyal Delta customers, then these efforts, as well as perks like the In-Air Coffeehouse, represent a different way of thinking about the mass-market flying experience. Travelers have loads of options for the carrier they choose to fly with these days. Few of them inspire or live up to the aspirations of airlines like PanAm and TWA during the Jet Age when flying was an experience rather than a necessity. Today’s reality is more defined by shrinking legroom, angry passengers, confusing pricing and flier rights, and the feeling that hurtling through the sky in a metal tube is just another way to get where you’re going.

Travel inspiration is lacking. The perks for being part of an airline loyalty program are primarily reserved for people who fly a number of miles that seems unheard of to the average person. Something like Group Drop flips that and gives reason to be inspired by a loyalty program for once. Those of us of the Millennial and younger generations missed the “golden era” of flying, and its high time a legacy carrier like Delta brought it back. May the believers among us continue to gather round the proverbial coffee bar at 30,000 feet, toasting our cappuccinos to a new era of journeys, joe, and ample legroom.",https://cdn1.matadornetwork.com/blogs/1/2026/01/inair-coffeehouse-gate-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 22:56:33.156186

The company confirmed that construction activities for the low-carbon ammonia plant are now underway, reinforcing its commitment to advancing cleaner energy solutions on a global scale.

The groundbreaking ceremony for the Wabash Low-Carbon Ammonia Project took place on January 5 and was held at the Hay Adams Hotel in Washington, D.C. The event brought together approximately 70 attendees, including senior government representatives, industry leaders, and key stakeholders involved in the project. Among the distinguished participants were Kim Yoon-duk, Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of the Republic of Korea; Hong Namkoong, President and Chief Executive Officer of SAMSUNG E&A; James P. Danly, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy; and Simon Greenshields, Chairman of the Board of Wabash Valley Resources.

The project will be constructed in Terre Haute, Indiana, and is designed as an environmentally responsible ammonia production facility. Once operational, the plant will have the capacity to produce approximately 500,000 metric tons of ammonia annually. In addition, it will incorporate advanced carbon capture technologies capable of capturing up to 1.67 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to the decarbonization of industrial ammonia production.

This initiative is recognized as a nationally significant project and is supported through funding and collaboration from the U.S. Department of Energy, Korea’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, and the Ministry of Climate, Energy, and Environment. In October of the previous year, SAMSUNG E&A signed an Engineering, Procurement, and Fabrication (EPF) contract with Wabash Valley Resources valued at approximately KRW 680 billion, or around USD 475 million. The company is currently executing the project with a targeted completion date set for 2029.

To ensure the project’s success, SAMSUNG E&A plans to apply its extensive experience in ammonia plant development alongside its proprietary and differentiated technologies. These include digital transformation tools, artificial intelligence, automation systems, and modular construction techniques. The company is also working closely with its client and its technology partner, Honeywell UOP, to deliver a high-efficiency and reliable low-carbon ammonia facility.

Beyond this project, SAMSUNG E&A has been actively expanding its capabilities in future-oriented energy technologies. The company continues to invest in and develop core and diversified energy solutions, including ammonia, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), liquefied natural gas (LNG), carbon capture, and hydrogen. These efforts have recently translated into a series of successful contract awards, such as a Malaysian SAF plant, a biodegradable plastics facility in the UAE, eco-friendly LNG basic design work in Indonesia, a conceptual LNG design project in North America, and a SAF basic design project in the United States.

The feedstock Etlas uses will be harvested from crops that are grown on existing cropland, between main food cropping seasons. Such intermediate crops can help improve soil health while providing farmers with a new revenue stream, the companies said. As they use existing cropland during times when it previously has been unproductive like a fallow or cover period, they also do not lead to additional demand for land.

“By helping found Etlas, Corteva continues to deliver on two critical parts of our mission: to help fuel the world and to support farmers,” said Judd O’Connor, executive vice president of Corteva’s seed business unit. “Agriculture is part of the solution, and we are excited to see Etlas come to life.”

The Regulatory Push Toward Advanced SAF Today, most SAF is produced via HEFA.
Opportunities in Advanced SAF SAF offers a chance to turn residual waste streams into high-value products.
Technology Risk Advanced SAF technologies are still in their infancy.","Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is widely heralded as aviation’s most immediate lever for decarbonisation. Yet its ability to deliver meaningful lifecycle emissions reductions hinges on the successful development and deployment of second and third-generation advanced technologies. Increasing demand and rising blend targets under applicable SAF mandates mean that suppliers cannot rely on first-generation methods – such as blending fossil-based jet fuel with hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) derived from waste oils – to meet the future scale and sustainability demands of modern aviation.

The transition to advanced technologies will often require first-of-a-kind (FOAK) plants integrating multiple advanced processes. These projects are inherently high-risk: technology performance is uncertain, supply chains are delicate, and traditional EPC contracting models may not be appropriate. For stakeholders, this means an increased chance of ending up in a claims process involving delay, performance guarantees, or interface challenges. Anticipating risks through robust contractual frameworks and risk-sharing mechanisms will be critical to delivering SAF infrastructure successfully.

Why SAF matters

Aviation faces the same decarbonisation challenge as the resources and waste management sector and other heavy industries. Global air traffic is forecast to grow from 4.5 billion passengers in 20191 to 12.4 billion by 2050,2 intensifying scrutiny on aviation’s carbon footprint. In 2023, aviation contributed 2.5% of global energy-related CO₂ emissions; growing faster than rail, road, or shipping.3 This trend is likely to continue as demand for travel rises.

Battery-electric and hydrogen aircrafts remain commercially unviable in the near term. Conversely, SAF, a “drop-in” replacement for conventional jet fuel, is readily available and offers an average of 70% lifecycle emissions reductions4 when fully replacing kerosene, depending on feedstock and process.

The Regulatory Push Toward Advanced SAF

Today, most SAF is produced via HEFA. These are essentially waste oils and fats like used cooking oil, which can be blended with traditional jet fuel to create aviation-grade fuel. However, HEFA is limited and mostly imported from Asia.

To reduce dependence on first-generation SAF, regulators in the UK and Europe are steering the industry towards advanced production pathways. Both the UK’s SAF Mandate and the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation recently came into force and set a clear signal: that the future lies beyond HEFA. Two key routes dominate the pipeline:

Second-generation SAF: Fuels from waste and residues such as municipal solid waste or forestry residues. These feedstocks are familiar to the resources and waste management sector, but competition from energy recovery and biomass markets could limit availability.

Third-generation SAF (Power-to-liquid (PtL)): Synthetic fuels made using renewable electricity or low-carbon power to convert power into liquid hydrocarbons. These processes are energy-intensive and may compete for scarce renewable power.

Under the UK SAF Mandate, suppliers must blend 2% SAF into jet fuel by 2025, rising to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.5 From 2027, suppliers will not be able to rely on HEFA alone to meet compliance, and by 2040 HEFA’s share will be capped at approximately 40% of SAF used in the UK.6

The EU has taken a different approach, focusing on PtL. It has set ambitious PtL targets: 0.7% of jet fuel by 2030, rising to 35% by 2050.7 For operators or suppliers straddling both jurisdictions, the message is clear, start planning for a future built on these advanced SAF technologies.

Opportunities in Advanced SAF

SAF offers a chance to turn residual waste streams into high-value products. Municipal solid waste, forestry residues, and industrial offcuts can become SAF feedstock, diverting waste from landfill and creating new revenue streams. In the UK, these opportunities should continue to grow under the UK’s proposed Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RCM), which intends to operate like a CfD-style scheme guaranteeing a strike price for SAF, funded by a levy on jet fuel suppliers. The RCM framework is set out in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, which is currently under review in the House of Lords. While the RCM could reduce revenue risk and help projects reach Final Investment Decision (FID) in the near future, its political durability and strike price adequacy remain uncertain.

The UK Government’s support is also significant. Earlier this year, the UK’s Advanced Fuels Fund awarded £63 million to 17 developers, following £135 million in earlier rounds. These pioneering projects use technologies such as gasification, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, ethanol-to-jet, and PtL through electrolysis. Continued government grants and subsidies will likely assist the rate upon which these technologies can get up to scale.

Challenges and Risks in SAF Deployment

The majority of second and third-generation technologies are not yet proven at scale. Scaling these technologies will require complex, integrated and often FOAK plants combining chemical processing, power generation, and even carbon capture. These remain at pilot or early commercial stage and so the commercial viability and timelines of constructing plants of this nature are far from guaranteed.

Stakeholders involved in funding, designing, and constructing these plants should consider the following risks.

Technology Risk

Advanced SAF technologies are still in their infancy. Performance guarantees will be hard to secure, and lenders will demand strong risk mitigation. Employers and funders will seek to push liability down the chain, but contractors will invariably resist without clear risk-sharing mechanisms such as caps on liability and contract exclusions. Negotiating realistic performance guarantees and liquidated damages regimes at contract formation will be essential.

Supply Chain Issues

Critical plant components such as electrolysers, Fischer-Tropsch reactors, and carbon capture units are in short supply. Delays in procurement in one subsystem could have significant knock-on effects on project completion. Early procurement and contractual clarity on who bears procurement risk will be vital.

Integration Complexity

SAF plants combine multiple processes. Managing interfaces will require detailed FEED, clear commissioning regimes, and strong contractual integration. Traditional EPC models (i.e. where the EPC contractor holds sole responsibility) may not be feasible.

Certification and Compliance

SAF must meet strict aviation standards (e.g., ASTM D7566). Contracts should align performance testing and certification requirements across all packages. For second generation technologies using municipal solid waste, feedstock variability (as existing EfW plant operators will be all too familiar with) adds further complexity and will necessitate clear definitions of fuel envelopes and sampling protocols.

Fraud Risk

As demand increases for waste feedstocks required for the production of second-generation SAF, the risk of fraud also increases. SAF producers need to ensure that they have robust due diligence processes in place to verify the source and sustainability credentials of waste feedstocks.

Environmental and Policy Uncertainty

SAF production is energy-intensive and may compete for land, water, or renewable electricity. Policy support mechanisms such as the RCM could shift with political cycles, affecting investor confidence.

General Construction Risks

As with all major engineering projects, risks associated with unforeseeable delays, specification changes, payment disputes, and supply chain issues are invariably part of the construction phase. Contracts should address these risks at the outset and include resilient dispute resolution mechanisms (such as tiered dispute resolution) to address both routine and complex disputes.

Reputational Risk and Risk of Misleading Investors

The regulatory framework that applies to the production, supply and use of SAF (and other biofuels) is complex and the obligations under applicable SAF mandates may not be understood easily by consumers and investors. The advertising and promotion of SAF may give rise to legal risks under consumer protection laws and financial regulations.8

Conclusion

The SAF transition is not just an energy shift; it is a complex infrastructure challenge. Delivering second and third-generation technologies at scale will require rigorous planning, innovative contracting, and realistic risk allocation. These projects will test traditional delivery models, supply chains and technology performance.

Success demands realism: second and third-generation SAF technologies are not a silver bullet. Their future depends on overcoming cost, technology, and policy uncertainties. Those who anticipate these risks early and craft resilient contractual frameworks will be best placed to navigate any turbulence ahead.

The Harmonised Master List (HML) categorises infrastructure into five main groups, allowing it to access long-term credit at concessional rates, easier access to external commercial borrowings (ECB), besides availing funding from insurance or pension funds.

“We’d like to really move away, or at least distribute those assets, so that we can actually innovate and move more towards sustainable financing that includes commercial electric vehicles, bio CNG, sustainable aviation fuel, critical minerals, green steel and green cement, among others,” he said.

IIFCL is collaborating with the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), International Solar Alliance (ISA), and Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA) for creating innovative structures to augment infrastructure financing to these sectors.

Need for bigger role of states, ULBs

Calling for a need to broad-base infrastructure project funding flows to also include states and urban local bodies (ULBs) in a major way, Srivastava said fiscal incentives are needed to prompt states and ULBs for investing aggressively in infrastructure financing.

“We would expect some kind of, say, incentive push for new products which are Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) friendly so as not to constrain their balance sheets,” he said.

According to him, this can be done by routing them through the ₹1 lakh crore Urban Challenge Fund, pushing the subordinated debt product, a mezzanine structure that considers some of the risks involved or through bridge financing.

The demo/pilot plant scale holds a commanding 61% market share, indicative of the industry's early-stage technological and commercial validation phase. This segment encompasses first-of-a-kind integrated facilities that demonstrate the technical viability and initial economics of coupling DAC with fuel synthesis like Fischer-Tropsch or methanol-to-jet processes.

High capital intensity, evolving process designs, and the need to de-risk integrated operations before scaling define this segment, which is heavily reliant on government grants and strategic corporate investment.

By Buyer Type, Which Entity is Making the Most Forward-Looking Strategic Investments?

Energy companies are the leading buyer type, accounting for 48% of the market. Major oil and gas firms and integrated energy players are investing in CO2-to-fuels DAC as a strategic hedge and a pathway to diversify into sustainable fuel production.

Their involvement provides not just capital but crucial expertise in large-scale project management, fuel logistics, and market distribution. This buyer segment is primarily funding pilot projects and offtake agreements to secure a position in the future low-carbon fuel value chain and meet corporate net-zero Scope 3 emissions targets.

What are the Drivers, Restraints, Opportunities, and Trends in the Industrial CO2-to-Fuels Direct Air Capture Market?

The market is driven by stringent global and regional policies mandating sustainable aviation fuel blends and creating carbon credit mechanisms, such as the US Inflation Reduction Act’s 45Q tax credit enhancements and the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation.

The urgent need to decarbonize hard-to-abate transport sectors creates a powerful demand signal for non-biological, scalable liquid fuels. A primary restraint is the extremely high current levelized cost of fuel production, stemming from massive energy inputs for both capture and conversion and high capital expenditure for first-of-a-kind plants.

Energy efficiency and the availability of abundant, low-cost renewable power are fundamental limiting factors. This presents a monumental opportunity for technological innovation across the chain, from lower-energy sorbent materials for capture to more efficient thermochemical or electrochemical conversion pathways.

Key trends include the formation of vertical consortiums linking DAC providers, renewable energy developers, and fuel synthesizer companies; the strategic sourcing of government grants and offtake agreements to finance pioneer plants; and a focus on locating initial facilities in regions with superior renewable resources and favorable policy frameworks to improve early economics.

How is Switzerland's Pioneering DAC Technology and Finance Ecosystem Influencing Development?

Switzerland's market role is defined by its status as a global hub for pioneering DAC technology developers and a sophisticated climate finance ecosystem. While lacking the vast renewable resources of other leaders, Swiss innovation focuses on the cutting-edge capture technology itself, developing novel sorbents and modular, energy-efficient designs.

Swiss companies and financial institutions are instrumental in deploying pilot plants globally and in structuring financing for early commercial projects. The market here is less about large-scale fuel production and more about being the intellectual and technological nucleus for the DAC component of the value chain.

Competitive Landscape

The competitive landscape is currently bifurcated between pure-play DAC technology developers and integrated energy majors entering the space. For technology firms like Climeworks and Carbon Engineering, the strategy centers on continuously driving down the cost per ton of captured CO2 through material science and process engineering, while forming strategic alliances with partners in hydrogen production and fuel synthesis to offer integrated solutions.

For energy companies, competition is about securing the most promising technology partnerships, the best sites with low-cost renewables, and early offtake agreements. Success for all players hinges on navigating complex project finance, securing a mix of grants and strategic equity, and successfully scaling pilot plants to first commercial scale without major technical setbacks. The landscape is cooperative yet competitive, with consortiums often forming for specific projects while companies vie to establish their technology as the industry standard.

Atlanta and New York were among the airports with the least efficient flights overall, almost 50% worse than the airports running the most efficient flights, such as Abu Dhabi and Madrid.
Finally, regulation could ban the most polluting aircraft, as has already happened in places for the noisiest planes.
However, supply-chain failures have caused an aircraft order backlog of over 5,000 planes.” She said real progress in cutting aviation emissions lay in deploying SAF, Corsia, and modernising air routes.
Globally, flying is dominated by rich passengers, with just 1% of the world’s population responsible for 50% of aviation emissions.","Climate-heating emissions from aviation could be slashed in half – without reducing passenger journeys – by getting rid of premium seats, ensuring flights are near full and using the most efficient aircraft, according to analysis.

These efficiency measures could be far more effective in tackling the fast-growing carbon footprint of flying than pledges to use “sustainable” fuels or controversial carbon offsets, the researchers said. They believe their study, which analysed more than 27m commercial flights out of approximately 35m in 2023, is the first to assess the variation in operational efficiency of flights across the globe.

The amount of carbon dioxide per kilometre flown has been falling as aircraft become gradually more fuel efficient. However, the growth in the number of flights has far outstripped this, meaning the emissions helping to fuel the climate crisis are rising. Aviation’s carbon dioxide emissions could double or even triple by 2050, according to experts.

The new analysis found that more polluting flights were common from airports in the US and Australia, particularly smaller ones, as well as in parts of Africa and the Middle East. Airports in India, Brazil and south-east Asia were dominated by less polluting flights.

Atlanta and New York were among the airports with the least efficient flights overall, almost 50% worse than the airports running the most efficient flights, such as Abu Dhabi and Madrid.

The UN’s aviation body, Icao, is relying on an “unambitious and problematic” offsetting scheme, called Corsia, to cut emissions. But it has yet to require any airline to use a carbon credit. Icao was recently accused of having been captured by the industry. The EU has set a 2030 target for airlines to use 6% sustainable aviation fuel, made from waste cooking oil or produced using electricity, but the supply of these fuels is limited and expensive.

“We are currently stuck with a global situation where there is no hope that aviation will reduce its emissions,” said Prof Stefan Gössling, at Linnaeus University in Sweden and who led the research. In contrast, he said all-economy-seat planes, 95% flight occupancy and using today’s most efficient aircraft could cut fuel use and therefore emissions by 50-75%. “That is huge,” he said, adding that it would also mean far less sustainable fuel would be needed to make flying near emissions free in the future.

“I always thought air transport was already very efficient, and that is also what airlines like to tell people,” Gössling said. “But, in reality, it’s very inefficient because of the three factors: using old aircraft, transporting people [in premium seats] with lots of space, and often having aircraft that are not really fully loaded.” In 2023, the average “load factor” – seat occupancy – was almost 80%.

The study, published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, examined the efficiency of flights between 26,000 pairs of cities, based on the CO2 emitted per kilometre per passenger. The analysis involved 3.5 billion passengers who flew a combined distance of 6.8tn km, equivalent to 145 return journeys to the sun. The flights caused 577m tonnes of CO2 emissions, equivalent to the annual emissions of Germany.

The research found that the US, which is responsible for a quarter of all aviation emissions, had flights that were 14% more polluting than the global average. China, the second biggest aviation polluter, had flight efficiencies slightly above the global average, while the UK, the world’s third biggest aviation polluter, had efficiencies slightly below the average of 84.4g of CO2 per passenger kilometre.

The emissions on specific routes varied enormously. The most efficient route was from Milan, Italy, to Incheon airport near Seoul, South Korea (31.6g CO2/pkm). Modern, full planes with fewer premium seats are largely the reason for more efficient flights. The least efficient route was in Papua New Guinea, with the second worst from Ironwood airport to Minneapolis/St Paul in the US (805g CO2/pkm).

“While airlines often claim that fuel savings are in their own economic interest, the reality is that many airlines continue to fly with old aircraft, low load factors, or growing shares of premium-class seating,” the researchers said.

Gössling said replacing premium seats with denser economy seating was probably the most important factor. Overall, first and business class passengers are responsible for more than three times the emissions of economy passengers, he said, and up to 13 times more in the most spacious premium cabins.

Policies to implement greater efficiency could include softer options, such as requiring airlines to disclose an efficiency rating for each route, Gössling said: “Just as with white appliances, you wouldn’t want to fly with an airline that is rated F.”

Market-based policies could involve airports charging higher landing fees for more polluting aircraft, which also worsen the air quality of local communities, he said. Finally, regulation could ban the most polluting aircraft, as has already happened in places for the noisiest planes.

The potential improvements in efficiency set out in the study, such as replacing older, more polluting planes, would involve costs, and the aviation industry already runs on low profit margins. But Gössling argued the aviation industry had got stuck in a business model that focuses on growing passenger numbers to increase profit.

Instead, he said, it could run fewer, fuller flights with higher ticket prices. He said many flights were only taken because they were so cheap: “We know that a lot of air transport demand is induced. If you increase the cost, people would just choose a different type of holiday.”

Marie Owens Thomsen, the senior vice-president of sustainability at the International Air Transport Association, the trade association for the world’s airlines, said: “Airlines have a strong self-interest to reduce fuel burn and maximise load factors. However, supply-chain failures have caused an aircraft order backlog of over 5,000 planes.” She said real progress in cutting aviation emissions lay in deploying SAF, Corsia, and modernising air routes.

Globally, flying is dominated by rich passengers, with just 1% of the world’s population responsible for 50% of aviation emissions. Only about 10% of people fly at all each year and only 4% fly abroad. Even in richer nations such as the US and Germany, only about a half and a third of people respectively take flights.

A spokesperson for ICAO said its analysis determined that operational improvements could deliver 4-11% of the carbon emission reductions needed to reach net zero, with cleaner fuel delivering over half, and innovative technologies the rest. ICAO is encouraging accelerated action by its 193 member states, he said, and welcomed all research providing new insights.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b06434f03a5607fc4c5b5ce77edee1419819e1f9/657_441_3381_2704/master/3381.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0da4372d62353e64c3a7f2014b14e4c0",N,,2026-01-07 07:57:35.612360

INDIANAPOLIS and LONDON, Jan. 7, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Corteva Inc. (NYSE: CTVA) and bp (NYSE: BP, LSE: BP.L) today announced the launch of Etlas, their new 50:50 joint venture that will produce oil from crops – including canola, mustard and sunflower – for use in the production of biofuels like sustainable (or synthetic) aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel (RD). Etlas will harness both Corteva's century-long expertise in seed technology to develop crops ideally suited to produce SAF and RD as well as bp's expertise in refining and marketing fuel for the commercial transportation market.

Etlas aims to produce one million metric tonnes of feedstock per year by the mid-2030s, which could produce over 800 thousand tonnes of biofuel. Initial supply is scheduled to begin in 2027 for use in co-processing at refineries as well as at dedicated biofuels plants.

Leading industry estimates have global demand for SAF growing to as much as 10 million tonnes by 20301 -- from about 1 million tonnes in 2024, while global demand for RD could rise to as much as 35 million tonnes by 20302 from approximately 17 million tonnes in 2024. Etlas is designed to provide a reliable, scalable supply of feedstock to help meet this expected demand.

The feedstock Etlas uses will be harvested from crops that are grown on existing cropland, between main food cropping seasons. Such intermediate crops can help improve soil health while providing farmers with a new revenue stream. As they use existing cropland during times when it has previously been unproductive like a fallow or cover period, they also do not lead to additional demand for land.

Judd O'Connor, executive vice president of Corteva's seed business unit added: ""By helping found Etlas, Corteva continues to deliver on two critical parts of our mission: to help fuel the world and to support farmers. Agriculture is part of the solution, and we are excited to see Etlas come to life.""

Philipp Schoelzel, senior vice president, biofuels growth, bp added: ""This capital light joint venture creates optionality in our biofuels value chain, strengthening our position and helping deliver attractive returns. We're excited to collaborate with Corteva to deliver what our customers want.""

Ignacio Conti, Global Business Development Director at Corteva will be the new Etlas Chief Executive Officer and Gaurav Sonar, vice president, Novel Feedstocks at bp will become its Chair of the Board of Directors.

""As the aviation industry looks for reliable, sustainable and cost-competitive sources of SAF, it is clear farmers have a critical role to play,"" said Etlas CEO, Ignacio Conti. ""Etlas brings together global leaders in agriculture innovation and energy production to harness this demand by leveraging technological expertise and trusted relationships with farmers around the world to help scale production and boost supply while offering farmers new revenue streams.""

The mean CO2 intensity (g CO2 per RPK) is then derived by dividing an airport’s CO2 emissions by its RPK.
For these, fuel consumption per RPK can be calculated for each aircraft based on fuel use, emissions, and RPK.","Emissions and efficiency

Data is analysed for 27,451,887 flights (take-offs), operated between 26,156 bi-directional city pairs in 2023. Flights transported a total of 3,554,769,475 passengers over a total flown distance of 43,314,099,618 km (equivalent to 145 return journeys to the sun), or equalling 6,813,991,167,300 RPK (about 0.7 light years), causing emissions of 577,968,750 t CO2.

Fig. 1 illustrates the relevance of the 20 highest emitting countries. The United States is responsible for 25% of global emissions (144.6 Mt), with an average weighted efficiency per RPK that is 14.3% higher than the weighted global average. The second largest emitting country, China, follows with 49.7 Mt CO2, and an average weighted efficiency of 88.6 g CO2 per RPK. Together, the 20 countries account for 74.9% (433 Mt CO2) of global emissions from air passenger transport. Emissions on individual city pairs vary between a low of 31.6 g CO2 per RPK (Milan, Italy to Incheon/Seoul, South Korea) and a high of 888.3 g CO2 per RPK (Kavieng to Tokua Lakunai, within Papua New Guinea). The global average is 84.4 g CO2 per RPK.

The global variation in efficiencies can also be illustrated by airports, and for the busiest routes (Fig. 2). Results show that inefficient flights dominate in Africa, Oceania, the Middle East, and Central Asia. They are also common in North America (particularly smaller airports, less busy flights), East Asia, and Western South America. In Europe, Norway is particularly inefficient. Efficient flights dominate in Brazil, India, and Southeast Asia, as well as on routes with high traveller volumes. Other regions, including Europe, have both more and less efficient routes.

Larger airports have a higher efficiency averaged across arriving and departing flights (Fig. 3a). The standard deviation of flight CO2 intensities increases for larger airports too (Fig. 3b) as they serve more flights. This is statistically supported by rank correlations of (a) −0.57, (b) 0.54, and total CO₂ emissions are largely determined by RPK (Pearson: 0.98). Large variation in CO₂ intensity reflects on regional differences (Fig. 2).

Figure 4 further illustrates differences between the least and most efficient airports and airlines in the world. Average emissions between the least/most efficient airports and airlines (emissions of 0.1 Mt CO2 or more in 2023) can be more than a factor two. For example, airline LATAM (Chile) caused average emissions of 69.1 g CO2 per RPK, while Air Algerie (Algeria) emitted 115.0 g CO2 per RPK; airport Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) caused 67.5 g CO2 per RPK and Atlanta 103.0 g CO2 per RPK. There is also evidence that larger airlines are more efficient (Fig. 5a), and that passenger load factors influence efficiency (Fig. 5b).

Efficiency improvement potentials

These findings point to the importance of aircraft models, layouts, and load factors. These are analyzed to determine the theoretical maximum efficiency in the air transport system. Observed aircraft model efficiency varies considerably (Fig. 6). The most efficient models include Boeing 787–900 (55.4 g CO2 per RPK), 787–800 (59.8 CO2 per RPK), and Boeing 787–1000 (60.1 CO2 per RPK), followed by Airbus A320 neo (61.4 g CO2 per RPK), Airbus A321neo (64.1 CO2 per RPK), and Airbus A350 (76.2 g CO2 per RPK). If all aircraft were replaced with the Boeing 787-9 (long-haul) and the Airbus A321neo (short and medium-haul), this would result in fuel savings of −25% to −28% depending on respective market share (Fig. 7).

In regard to layouts, IATA21 suggests that business and first class seats are up to 5 times more CO₂-intense than economy class seats. Premium class seating is more common in wide-bodied aircraft and on long-haul flights, as well as among specific airlines including American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, and Swiss International Air Lines30. An all-economy class configuration would consequently reduce emissions. Here, results suggest that increasing passenger numbers to the maximum seating configuration for the most efficient aircraft (Airbus 350 and Boeing 787) would further reduce emissions by 21.5% to 56.7%, assuming no changes in the load factor.

In 2023, average passenger load factors were 78.9% for flown kilometers, with a range from 20.1% to 100% between individual flights. Increasing this load factor to 95% would further reduce emissions by 16.1%. Overall, emissions in 2023 could have been 54.5% to 76.0% lower, though a modest fuel penalty would have to be considered (see Methods). This suggests that transporting the same number of passengers over the same distances would be possible with less than half the current fuel consumption, if airlines only operated the most efficient aircraft models, switched to an all-economy layout, and increased the load factor to 95% (Fig. 7).

While this is the hypothetical maximum, analysis for 13,666 city pairs (52.2% of all city pairs) that are served by more than one airline or aircraft configuration suggests that operating these city pairs by the most efficient configuration currently in use would reduce emissions by 10.7%. This represents the already demonstrated efficiency gain in the air transport system, with airlines operating under their economic constraints.

Further analysis confirms that CO2 intensity strongly depends on passenger load factors and flight distance (Fig. 8). A least-squares linear regression with load factor and distance as predictors shows that a full flight (load factor 100%) covering 10,000 km emits, on average, 57 g CO2 per RPK. This almost doubles to 109 g CO2 per RPK for a half full flight (load factor 0.5) or increases to 83 g CO2 per RPK for a reduced flight distance of 1000 km at full capacity. However, there is considerable variation around this average (Fig. 8) likely highlighting the importance of aircraft models. Neglecting possible changes in passenger load, if every flight’s intensity was capped at this average (the medium cap model), increasing efficiency for approximately the lower half of flights would save 8.6% in emissions (or 50 Mt CO₂). A low cap model, allowing average intensities (from the medium cap model) and up to 33% higher, would only affect the most inefficient flights, consequently saving only 1.1% of emissions. A high cap model, however, which requires every flight to be at least 33% more efficient than the average (of the medium cap model), effectively requiring the highest industry standards, would save 34.6% of emissions or 200 Mt CO₂. These scenarios are more realistic compared to those discussed around Fig. 7 as they acknowledge constraints many airlines face when operating.

Efficiency model

The comparison of commercial passenger air transport efficiencies requires a comparable indicator. CO2 intensity, i.e. Emissions per revenue passenger kilometer (g CO2 per RPK) can be calculated for aircraft, airports, and city pairs. This indicator is directly proportional to fuel use per revenue passenger kilometer (kg fuel per RPK). It is influenced by many factors, including the aircraft design (airframe, engine type, winglets), operational aspects (distance, speed, flight route, flight altitude, weather, detours, holding patterns, green flying techniques), as well as on-the-ground conditions (taxiing, ground power supply). Energy use per passenger also depends on aircraft layout (seat numbers), load factors, and co-loaded cargo. Data is limited to aircraft with 30 seats and more, i.e., private aircraft and business jets are not part of the analysis. Data allows us to calculate average load factors for each city pair, from which global load factors and fuel use can be derived.

To factor these aspects into the calculation of emissions per RPK, an efficiency model is used that considers distance, aircraft type, and payload (passenger and cargo weight). 2023 data for the efficiency model is derived from:

1)

T100I (AirlineData): flight-specific load factors for flights to and from the USA and Canada, annual means.

2)

ICAO TFS (Traffic by Flight Stage): similar to T100I with global coverage, though not for all airlines.

3)

IATA WATS (World Air Transport Statistics): annually averaged, airline-specific load factors (i.e., not disaggregated by city pair or aircraft type), further split into international and domestic services, for about 219 airlines.

4)

FlightGlobal: similar to IATA WATS, with airline-level data (annual mean load factors) for 178 airlines.

Data consequently has three levels of granularity for load factors:

Level 1: Airline average over one year (52% of all flights).

Level 2: Airline–city pair average over one year (12.4%).

Level 3: Airline–aircraft–city pair average over one year (15.2%).

T100I and ICAO TFS provide level 3 data. From these, level 2 and level 1 averages can be derived by averaging revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) and available seat kilometers (ASK) across aircraft serving a given city pair (level 2) and additionally across all city pairs (level 1, ICAO TFS only). By contrast, IATA WATS and FlightGlobal only provide level 1 data.

For each individual flight, the highest level of load factor is sought, following a fallback cascade across the data sources. When IATA WATS is established as the best data source, the corresponding value for either domestic or international flights is used. As a last fallback, a global load factor over all airlines is calculated for three distance categories: short-haul (≤1500 km), medium-haul (1501−3500 km) and long haul (>3500 km). This load factor is used when no other load factor (level 1–3) can be found.

The induced error can be calculated for using global means instead of level 3 values. When bootstrapping 100,000 samples, the per-flight absolute error mean is 0.0406, and the median is 0.0145. The bootstrapped 95% CI for the absolute error mean is [0.0389, 0.0423]. This corresponds to a relative error of 5.38% with a 95% CI of [5.15%, 5.62%]. Notably, this error affects 20.4% of the load factor, as a higher-level granularity for load factors is available for 79.6% of flights.

Total fuel use is a function of total load and aircraft-specific performance data. Seat-classes are weighted by multiplying average per-passenger emissions with a seat-class factor based on IATA’s cabin class method21. This method considers the number of seats per class in a given aircraft configuration. The formula for this calculation is provided in (Eq. (1)); the passenger share of fuel use in (Eq. (2)), also involving data from Flight Global, which provides passenger data. Fuel use is transformed into CO₂ in (Eq. (3)).

More specifically, fuel consumption is calculated for each individual flight, accounting for the specific aircraft model, cabin layout, and passenger/cargo load factors. Fuel consumption is derived from a physical aircraft performance model, which calculates fuel consumption for a given aircraft model, considering flight distance and takeoff weight. The total fuel consumption of the flight is then broken down into fuel use per passenger and converted to CO2 emissions per passenger. All subsequent analyses are based on these individual-flight emission characteristics, allowing for more nuanced results than calculations based on airline-average or city pair-average load factors or performance data.

Allocation of total fuel burn of a given flight to individual passengers and subsequent conversion to CO2 emissions follows these steps:

(a) Calculation of fuel use for payload in ton kilometres (tkm)

$${fuel\; per\; tkm}=({total}\, {fuel})/({flight}\, {distance}\times {payload})$$

(1)

(b) Calculation of fuel per passenger (pax)

$${{{\rm{fuel}}}}\, {{{\rm{per}}}}\, {{{\rm{pax}}}} = \; {{{\rm{fuel}}}}\, {{{\rm{per}}}}\, {{{\rm{tkm}}}}\times {{{\rm{distance}}}}\times 100\, {{\rm{kg}}} \\ \times {{{\rm{freight}}}}\, {{{\rm{correction}}}}\, {{{\rm{freight}}}}\, {{{\rm{correction}}}}=\frac{{m}_{{{\rm{pax}}}}+0.5\times {m}_{{{\rm{cargo}}}}}{{m}_{{{\rm{pax}}}}+{m}_{{{\rm{cargo}}}}}$$

(2)

Here, passenger emissions and 50% of the emissions from freight transport are allocated to passengers, assuming a passenger (including baggage) weighs 100 kg39.

(c) Calculation of CO₂ per Passenger (pax)

$${{{{\rm{CO}}}}}_{2} \; {{{\rm{per}}}}\; {{{\rm{pax}}}}={{{\rm{fuel}}}}\; {{{\rm{per}}}}\; {{{\rm{pax}}}}\times 3.16$$

(3)

The resulting per-passenger emission intensity enables comparisons of flight efficiency. Figure 8 illustrates the inherent dependence of emission intensity on flight distance, with longer flights generally exhibiting lower emission intensities. This is because takeoff and ascent to cruising altitude - the most fuel-intensive phase of a flight - account for a larger proportion of total fuel burn on short-haul routes.

These data are used to assess all flights; where no data for a specific flight is available, global mean values are used for three distance classes (short-/medium-/long-haul). Flight distances are based on great circle distances, which are converted to flown distances by using ICAO’s correction factor: +50 km for flights up to 550 km, + 100 km for flights between 550 and 5500 km, and +125 km for flights >5500 km40. Data is available for 26,155 city pairs and 61,607 ‘flights’, with one flight being defined as a unique combination of departure airport, arrival airport, airline, and aircraft type. Non-operational code-sharing flights have been removed from the dataset; only the airline carrying out the flight is considered. A weakness of the dataset is that it includes mostly scheduled flights.

Validation checks

The dataset comprises 27,451,887 flights in 2023, carrying a total of 3,554,769,475 passengers over a distance of 6,813,991,167,301 RPK, and causing emissions of 577,968,750 t CO2. This is less than the 35.3 million flights, 4.319 billion passengers, 8232 billion RPK, and the 530 Mt CO₂ reported through the CORSIA Central Registry (said to cover 99% of total 2023 emissions on scheduled services reported for 2023 by ICAO41)42,43. Our data consequently covers 83% of RPK and 82% of passengers in comparison to ICAO data. A potential explanation is that there are data gaps related to the reporting of charter operators.

Consistency analysis of our database shows that the number of seats in aircraft is always higher than the number of passengers. Airline load factor comparison with three airlines, Ryanair, Lufthansa, and American Airlines, for which data is publicly available, also suggests that variation is within 10%. For example, in 2023, Ryanair reported a 93% load factor, whilst the model suggests 93.6%; Lufthansa reported 82%, whilst the dataset is 78.9%; and American Airlines reported 83.5%, whilst the model suggests 81%. It is difficult to validate emission intensities for airlines due to variable operating conditions and inconsistent reporting standards. Annual reports may not include RPK numbers, refer to financial years rather than calendar years, combine data on operational fuel use for cargo and passengers, combine different accounting scopes, deduct sustainable aviation fuel emission “savings”, or calculate CO₂e rather than CO₂. Airlines also have subsidiaries that may have been included/excluded in the accounting. However, the communication teams of all airlines mentioned in this article (LATAM, Ryanair, EasyJet, Qatar Airways, Emirates, China Southern, British Airways, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Air Algérie) were provided with the data sources used in our analysis, as well as the airline-specific emission efficiencies (g CO2 per RPK) calculated, and were asked to comment. LATAM responded by saying that it does not wish to comment. EasyJet provided a link to their own calculations, suggesting slightly lower emission efficiencies (66.64 g CO2 per RPK) than calculated using our model (74.2 CO2 per RPK).

Emission attribution

Emissions are assessed at different scales of analysis, for airports, airlines, or countries. For airports, emissions are calculated by aggregating half the emissions from all incoming and outgoing flights. This ensures that half of the emissions for each city pair are attributed to the respective departure and arrival airports. The approach addresses that fuel use can vary between incoming and outgoing flights due to differences in flight paths or weather. Airline emissions consider all emissions from flights operated by an airline, with intensities calculated by dividing the total amount of CO2 by the number of RPK. Country emissions are calculated by aggregating emissions from all airports within national borders.

Efficiency calculations

The efficiency of air transport is calculated for aircraft, airlines, airports, city pairs, and countries, using the same indicator (g CO2 per RPK). Airport emissions are calculated for 3218 airports by summing up the CO2 for all departures and arrivals from/at each airport, and dividing the value by two to assign half the emissions from every flight to this airport. In an identical approach, half of all RPKs for every departure and arrival are calculated. The mean CO2 intensity (g CO2 per RPK) is then derived by dividing an airport’s CO2 emissions by its RPK. Aircraft comparisons are based on city pairs, for which data is available for all aspects of the flight. For these, fuel consumption per RPK can be calculated for each aircraft based on fuel use, emissions, and RPK. On this basis, aircraft can be ranked by observed efficiency.

Optimum efficiencies on city pairs can be calculated for all routes served by more than one flight configuration (13,666 out of 26,156 city pairs, or 52.2%). Avoided CO₂ can be determined by dividing the most efficient average (g CO2 per RPK) by the average efficiency on the city pair, multiplied with CO₂ emissions on this city pair. Values can then be aggregated for all city pairs, and total emission be compared to current emissions in the system. This can be expressed as (Eq. (4)):

Ebest = Best (minimum) efficiency for a given route (e.g., fuel per tkm)

Ei = Efficiency of airline i on the same route

CO2i = Current CO₂ emissions of airline i

CO2best,i = CO₂ emissions at best efficiency for airline i

Then, the formula for CO₂ emissions at the best efficiency is:

$${{{\rm{C}}}}{{{\rm{O}}}}_{2,{{{\rm{best}}}},{{{\rm{i}}}}}=\left(\frac{{E}_{{{\rm{best}}}}}{{E}_{i}}\right)\times {{\rm{C}}}{{{\rm{O}}}}_{2,{{\rm{i}}}}$$

(4)

If there are multiple airlines on a city‑pair, the total emissions improvement can be calculated as (Eq. (5)):

$${{{\rm{Total}}}}\, {{{\rm{CO}}}}_{2}\, {{{\rm{reduction}}}}=1-\frac{\sum {{{\rm{r}}}}{{CO}}_{2,{{{\rm{best}}}},{{{\rm{i}}}}}}{\sum {{{\rm{r}}}}{{CO}}_{2,{{{\rm{i}}}}}}$$

(5)

Assuming that only the most efficient aircraft were operated on all city pairs served by more than one carrier, emissions would be 10.66% lower than current emissions (517 Mt CO₂, rather than 578 Mt CO₂). This is the lower theoretical threshold for emission reductions based on observed operational efficiency.

Theoretical maximum efficiency. There are three ways to increase the efficiency of air transport: using only the most efficient aircraft, switching to one flight class (economy); and increasing load factors. The maximum efficiency for the year 2023 can be calculated in three steps.

Step 1: Global fleet of most efficient aircraft models. The effect of replacing the entire 2023 fleet with the two most efficient models - the Boeing 787-9 (55.4 g CO₂ per RPK) and the Airbus A321neo (61.4 g CO₂ per RPK) would lead to emission reductions in the range of 26.6% (all Airbus) to 33.7% (all Boeing), compared to the current fleet average of 83.6 g CO₂ per RPK, with (Eq. (6)):

Iavg = average CO₂ intensity (gCO₂ per RPK)

Iopt = CO₂ intensity of the Boeing 787‑9 (gCO₂ per RPK)

S = relative savings

$$S=1-\frac{{I}_{{{\rm{opt}}}}}{{I}_{{{\rm{avg}}}}}$$

(6)

Step 2: Economy class only configuration. To determine the difference between an air transport system consisting only very efficient aircraft models, we calculate frequency weighted averages for average seat numbers in economy, business, and first class for the five configurations of the most efficient aircraft models (A350-1000; A350-900; Boeing 787-1000; Boeing 787-800; and Boeing 787-900). As Table 1 illustrates, first class seating is uncommon in these aircraft, partially explaining their efficiency.

The difference in space use between all-economy vs. business and first class aircraft layout can be calculated using current economy to business to first ratios, with each first class seat equalling 5 economy seats, and every business class seat 4 economy class seats21. The percentage increase in seat numbers can be calculated based on data from Official Airline Guide (OAG) and FleetsAnalyzer (FA) for models A350 and B787, which represent the range of most efficient aircraft. In contrast to FA, OAG does not distinguish economy and economy-premium class; this might explain some of the difference in observed maximum seat numbers. OAG data refers to the 2023 flight schedule that lists the actual cabin layout for every flight; FA data considers actual aircraft configurations in fleets of various airlines (2023 data).

Table 1 shows the observed maximum seat number for the different models for both databases, and the average seat numbers for each model. The theoretical maximum number of seats can be calculated based on the following formula (Eq. (7)):

$${S}_{\max }={S}_{{{\rm{eco}}}}+1.5\cdot {S}_{{{\rm{prem.eco}}}}+4\cdot {S}_{{{\rm{bus}}}}+5\cdot {S}_{{{\rm{first}}}}$$

(7)

where S is the number of seats per class, and the factors are the IATA seat class factors, and economy (eco), premium-economy (prem.eco), business (bus) and first (first).

The increase in seat numbers in an all-economy layout is then determined based on an “assumed maximum”, representing either the calculated theoretical maximum seat number or the certified maximum seat number (whichever is lower). Certified maximums refer to type certification that are based on emergency evacuation demands13. This means that the number of seats in the Airbus A350-1000 is capped at 440, and at 420 seats for Boeing 787-1000 and 787-900.

Results suggest that an all-economy layout would allow airlines to carry 26% to 57% more passengers, which is equivalent to the theoretical reduction in fuel use of an all-economy layout.

Step 3: 95% load factor. Limiting capacity growth in global air transport will lead to higher load factors. In particular low-cost carriers have reported load factors of up to 94%44. Here we assume a hypothetical maximum load factor of 95% that would reflect on an air transport system with considerably reduced capacity25. Given the current load factor of 78.9%, aircraft could carry 16.1% more passengers if available capacity was utilized at 95%.

Fuel penalty. Calculations in Step 2 and 3 do not consider that optimization for efficiency will incur a fuel penalty due to the additional weight carried. Analysis for the two aircraft models characterizing the range of layout gains, i.e., A350-1000 and Boeing 787-800 (26.1–56.7% more seats), suggests that this fuel penalty is small. This is illustrated in Fig. 9 for the A350-1000: depending on distance, fuel consumption increases by 5.8% to 13.9%, implying a small fuel-penalty even in comparison of a near-empty (20% load factor) to a close to full (80% load factor) aircraft. We conclude that increasing seat numbers or load factor will marginally increase fuel use. The potential reduction in fuel consumption in an optimized air transport system is thus in the range of −55% to −75%, not considering the fuel penalty.

CO2 intensity cap model

A CO2 intensity cap model illustrates how much emissions from global aviation would fall if flights were required to operate at a mandated maximum CO2 intensity. However, considering such a cap as constant is largely unrealistic as it is strongly dependent on flight distance and load factors. Ignoring changes to load factors or flight distance, we isolate the variation independent of those. Other scenarios investigate increasing load factors (in exchange for fewer aircraft, see above).

The CO2 intensity c is therefore modelled as a function of load factor l and flight distance d, linear in both predictors (Eq. (8)):

$$c\,=\,\frac{a}{l\,+\,{l}_{0}}\,+\,\frac{b}{d\,+\,{d}_{0}}$$

(8)

Inverse proportionality is assumed as increasing load decreases the intensity, so does a longer flight (larger aircraft, less resistance at higher altitude, smaller contribution of fuel-intensive takeoff). This model is fit via least-squares, estimating the constants to (rounded) a = 54 g CO2 per RPK, b = 35,000 g CO2 per pax, d0 = 180 km. The offset in load factor l0 is manually set to 0.01 to prevent intensities going to infinity for very low load factors which is not well constrained with the data given how few flights operate that empty. This model is considered to be the medium cap model representing an average intensity. The low clow and high cap model chigh are defined as clow = 4c/3, chigh = 2c/3, representing 33.3% lower/higher efficiency, respectively. Theoretically, for very long flight distances fuel consumption increases due to the additional weight of large amounts of fuel. This motivates to add a term proportional to distance d, which however, does not yield a positive proportionality constant, contradicting this theory with data. In that sense, higher intensities for very long flight distances are not supported with the data here.

Limitations

Findings are characterized by the following limitations: Our data comprises only a share of global commercial passenger air transport (83% of RPK and 82% of passengers in comparison to ICAO42,43). It is unclear how the difference affects the representativeness of our findings for commercial passenger air transport. We also acknowledge that ICAO’s distance correction is crude, as the ratio of actual flight distance to great-circle distance depends on multiple factors such as weather, airspace restrictions, or airport congestion. Load factors are calculated based on three levels of granularity, and a fallback option that is the global average. Analysis suggests that the error affects in particular small, remote, or politically isolated territories (Nauru, St. Pierre and Miquelon, Wallis and Futuna, Bhutan, or Greenland), countries where reporting is more limited (China, Russian Federation, India), or specific airlines and airline subsidiaries (e.g., Sichuan Airlines, TUI Airways Ltd., Interglobe Aviation Ltd.). Last, our proposed strategies to increase efficiencies in global aviation will in practice be met with various economic and political challenges. Airlines operate within economic constraints and a business environment shaped by subsidies, limited ambition for climate change mitigation, and expectations of continued growth. Efforts to enhance air transport efficiency will have to be addressed within this multifaceted context.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-03069-4/MediaObjects/43247_2025_3069_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2026-01-07 07:57:45.759056

While 2025 was defined by the rollout of binding mandates in Europe, 2026 is shaping up as a test of the industry's ability to scale supply amid divergent policy frameworks and intensifying competition for feedstocks.

The targeted takeoff is hitting a tangible ceiling of a feedstock bottleneck that threatens to ground 2030 ambitions.

With binding obligations now clashing against a supply chain still dependent on limited waste oil pools, 2026 becomes a stress test for the sector's ability to convert policy targets into physical gallons.

Mandates create market

Singapore, with other emerging Asia mandates and ReFuelEU requirement (2025-2029), lock in cross-continental demand, reinforced by the UK's carbon-intensity framework that will continue anchoring non-negotiable demand signals.

Market participants interviewed by Platts, part of S&P Global Energy, expect global SAF production and consumption to remain broadly balanced in 2026, with no material supply-demand mismatches and prices to stabilize, barring major feedstock disruptions.

""Assuming no new legislation is introduced, there should not be a significant gap between SAF uplift and production in 2026. Prices should remain at current levels or trend lower over the year,"" an Asia-based biofuels trader said.

Global SAF consumption is projected at 2.47 million metric tons for 2026, closely matched by production of approximately 2.54 million mt, according to S&P Global Energy Horizons.

However, supply responses are increasingly from Asia.

""APAC [Asia-Pacific] is pivoting from feedstock exporter to SAF producer,"" said LT Leong, president at NGen Energy. ""2026 marks infrastructure catch-up to meet mandate-driven demand, with smaller 50,000-120,000 mt refineries popping in Southeast Asia for 2028-2029 startup.""

Financial realism

The market isn't just dealing with physical fuel, but with the credit risks associated with high transition costs.

Aviation finance intelligence firm Ishka mentioned that financial stakeholders have factored SAF costs into their credit models.

""Lessors and lenders factor SAF-related cost burdens into assessments,"" Ishka said, adding that for European carriers, ""Lower ATF prices in 2025 have absorbed ETS and SAF compliance cost increases,"" though this cushion might vanish as mandates tighten and carbon allowance phase-outs accelerate.

Feedstock, HEFA stifle as Asia exports emerge

China's 1.2 million mt export whitelist positions Asia-Pacific as the critical swing supplier for 2026, with Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia ramping hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids capacity. However, feedstock constraints threaten to bottleneck these mega-refineries despite projects coming online through 2026-2028.

Combined UCO from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand cannot sustain a single 620,000 mt like Phoenix mega-refinery, LT said. ""This constraint pushes toward smaller 50,000-120,000 mt facilities securing adequate feedstock per month locally without overextending. Start small and manageable.""

With over 80% announced SAF projects relying on HEFA while supply covers near-term mandates, constraints on aforementioned feedstocks suggest that progress toward 2030 ambitions require rapid diversification.

Thailand and Malaysia's HEFA capacity ramp-up will further boost Asia SAF supply in 2026, aiding EU compliance while intensifying UCO competition.

Asian UCO and PFAD hit three-year highs in 2025, fueled by regional (Indonesia-China) export restriction. Regional tensions over feedstock definitions persist, as Europe restricts POME which Asian producers consider essential resources.

Policy-induced pause

The US SAF market is facing a set of contrasting headwinds.

Supply in 2026 is forecast at 11,600 b/d against demand of 11,800 b/d, down from 13,900 b/d in 2025, according to S&P Global Energy analysts reflecting no federal mandate, RFS feedstock competition, and 45Z credit restrictions under ""One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.""

The July 2025 legislation limits eligible feedstocks to North American sources, removes the $1.75/gal advanced credit, and excludes ILUC from carbon scoring.

The production is projected to rebound to 16,200 b/d in 2027 on a $1/gal incentive for fuels achieving 50% GHG reduction, supported by the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, according to S&P Global Energy's analyst.

EU antidumping duties have stifled transatlantic trade. US Customs recorded zero SAF exports in November 2025; however, policy clarity and new capacity are expected to restore flows by 2027.

Data centers compete for renewable energy, constraining SAF inputs. IATA projects SAF at just 0.8% of 2026 fuel consumption (2.4 million mt) with a $4.5 billion incremental cost, exposing policy fragmentation.

Bridging green premium via Scope 3 and registries

The ""Green Premium"" with SAF prices three to five times higher than jet fuel remains aviation's most formidable barrier. In 2025, IATA estimated the industry absorbed $3.6 billion in SAF premiums.

While mandates drive volume, airline appetite for long-term price exposure is cooling, as average offtake durations have plummeted from 3.7 years in 2023 to just 2.2 years in 2025, Ishka said as carriers pivot toward short-term compliance over long-term hedging in a volatile market.

For European carriers, SAF costs are increasingly assessed within a broader environmental cost stack, often overshadowed by rising EU ETS expenses. ""For many European airlines, EU ETS costs now exceed SAF costs, so they are viewed as a combined environmental cost,"" Ishka said.

""Airlines will reevaluate 10% SAF by 2030 commitments as production falls short,"" said Willie Walsh, director general of IATA.

Corporate Scope 3 targets fuel SAF certificate demand through book-and-claim systems, enabling a London flight to claim decarbonization from Los Angeles-pumped SAF.

Companies offset travel emissions by purchasing certificates, subsidizing the green premium.

The market migrates from bilateral deals to centralized registries, bridging price gaps where policy incentives falter.

IATA's SAF Registry, operated by CADO, tracks global transactions and signaled a critical shift toward centralized tracking and standardization, aiming to prevent double-counting while building investor confidence.

Fragmentation between CORSIA and regional initiatives raises costs and curtails emissions reductions; airlines remain committed to net zero, but policymakers must harmonize global energy transition frameworks, said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA SVP Sustainability and Chief Economist.

Though challenges around credibility, double-counting, and regulatory recognition persist.

SAF enters 2026 at a maturation crossroads: balanced fundamentals provide stability, but feedstock constraints demand the urgent deployment of ATJ, FT, and e-SAF, capable of sustainable scaling beyond 2030.

In 2025, the company advanced several key levers of its sustainability strategy, from scaling sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to electrifying last‑mile delivery and building solar‑powered infrastructure. These achievements mark meaningful progress toward DHL’s goal of net‑zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and reinforce its role in building more sustainable, efficient, and resilient global trade. Here are five milestones that defined this progress.=

Advancing sustainable aviation: Largest SAF agreement in the U.S.

Air freight remains the most carbon-intensive mode of transport per ton-kilometre, and DHL has been a pioneer in adopting SAF since 2021. In 2025, DHL signed one of its largest-ever SAF agreements with Phillips 66: over 240,000 metric tons (approximately 314 million liters) of SAF over three years. This will reduce lifecycle emissions by approximately 737,000 metric tons of CO2e – about the same impact as 2,400 one-way flights from Los Angeles to Frankfurt. The fuel, produced in California, will primarily serve DHL’s West Coast operations.

Cutting emissions at sea: Partnership with CMA CGM

Ocean freight moves most global goods, making sustainable marine fuel (SMF) critical for reducing emissions. DHL and CMA CGM partnered to purchase 8,800 metric tons of UCOME second-generation biofuel, enabling an estimated 25,000 metric tons of CO₂e emissions reduction on a well-to-wake basis (covering the full lifecycle of fuel emissions). That is roughly equivalent to powering a large container ship for several days of operation. This collaboration demonstrates a significant step for low-carbon maritime transport.

Hydrogen on the horizon: First pilot in the Middle East

Hydrogen-powered trucks are emerging as a solution for decarbonising long-haul logistics, providing a longer range than electric trucks. DHL has been actively testing hydrogen trucks in Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific, and will now introduce them in the Middle East. Last year, DHL signed an MoU with Hyperview in Saudi Arabia to pilot hydrogen-powered trucks. The project aligns with Saudi Vision 2030 and includes a feasibility study for hydrogen infrastructure, reinforcing DHL’s commitment to reducing logistics-related greenhouse gas emissions in emerging markets.

Fully electric delivery across Germany

DHL aims to electrify 66% of its last-mile fleet – the final step of getting a shipment to the end customer – by 2030, with Germany leading the charge. In 2025, the company announced one of its largest electric‑vehicle purchases: 2,400 new Ford electric vans for its Post & Parcel Germany division, the majority of which have already been delivered and are in operation. This milestone means that one-third of all German postcodes will benefit from zero-GHG-emission last-mile delivery, powered by a fleet of more than 35,000 electric vehicles, including e-trikes, e-vans, and e-bikes.",https://payloadasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/favicon.png,N,,2026-01-07 04:57:06.124781

The Department for Transport stressed that the consultation does not propose any immediate changes to the SAF Mandate.","The U.K. Department for Transport has indicated it may be reconsidering its position on the use of crop-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), opening the door for possible changes to the country’s SAF Mandate in the future. In late 2025, the department launched a public consultation process to gather evidence on whether fuels made from crops should be allowed under the mandate, reports Biodiesel Magazine.

On December 22, the department invited comments on SAF produced from crops, including energy crops, cover crops, and food and feed crops. The call for evidence is linked to the U.K.’s main SAF policy measures, which include the SAF Mandate that came into force in 2025, the Advanced Fuels Fund that supports early-stage SAF projects, and a revenue certainty scheme aimed at reducing financial risk for developers.

In announcing the consultation, the Department for Transport said the SAF Mandate provides long-term certainty by creating a legal framework that guarantees demand for SAF in the U.K. This, it said, helps businesses plan investments, build supply chains and make confident commercial decisions. The government added that any future changes to the mandate would only be considered if there is a strong justification and if such changes do not undermine policy stability or investor confidence.

The government said the SAF sector is expanding rapidly, and policy will need to ensure that the mandate delivers real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions while keeping costs manageable for consumers. It also said the mandate must align with the U.K.’s wider climate targets, work effectively with other low-carbon fuel schemes, support domestic production and adapt to technological progress.

As part of this process, the government is seeking evidence on the availability and cost of crop-based SAF feedstocks, the impact of such fuels on U.K. industries, and potential sustainability risks. It is also asking how regulation could address or reduce those risks.

Under the current SAF Mandate, fuel suppliers must meet two obligations: a main SAF requirement and a separate requirement for power-to-liquid fuels. The main obligation started at 2% of total fossil jet fuel supplied in 2025 and is set to rise to 9.5% by 2030 and 18.5% by 2040. The power-to-liquid requirement begins at 0.2% in 2028 and increases to 3.5% by 2040.

The mandate also places limits on the use of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). HEFA fuels can meet the full obligation in 2025 and 2026, but their share will be capped at 71% in 2030 and reduced further to 35% by 2040.

At present, the SAF Mandate only allows fuels made from sustainable wastes and residues, recycled carbon sources such as non-recyclable plastics, or power-to-liquid fuels produced using low-carbon energy. SAF made from crops, including food, feed, energy and cover crops, is currently excluded.

All SAF used under the mandate must deliver at least a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Additional sustainability rules apply to certain feedstocks, covering issues such as biodiversity protection, land use, soil carbon and waste management.

While the exclusion of crop-based SAF remains in place, the government said it is open to reviewing new or updated evidence. The current call for evidence is intended to assess the possible benefits, risks and trade-offs of using crops for SAF production.

The Department for Transport stressed that the consultation does not propose any immediate changes to the SAF Mandate. It said that if the evidence supports a review of feedstock rules, any changes would be subject to a formal consultation and would require amendments to existing legislation.

The consultation mainly focuses on energy crops, cover crops and food and feed crops, but the government has also invited comments on other types of crops not clearly covered by these categories.

The call for evidence opened on December 22, 2025, and will remain open until March 16, 2026. Further details are available on the Department for Transport’s website.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-1.png,N,,2026-01-07 07:58:05.799002

The chosen path combines efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with measures to strengthen economic development, job creation, and social inclusion.

Brazil is expected to attract R$ 2 trillion in investments over the next 10 years in sustainable energy infrastructure, generating three million jobs and revitalizing industry, with energy serving as a driving force for the nation’s sustainable development.

In this new green economy, investments will focus on wind, solar, hydropower, biomass, biodiesel, biomethane, ethanol, green diesel, carbon capture and storage, sustainable aviation fuel, and low-carbon hydrogen.

The PNTE was established by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva during a meeting of the National Energy Policy Council (CNPE) on August 27, 2024, when he approved a resolution presented by the body chaired by the Minister of Mines and Energy, Alexandre Silveira.

According to its framework, the PNTE aims to “guide national efforts toward transforming Brazil’s energy matrix into a low-carbon structure, contributing to the achievement of net greenhouse gas emissions neutrality in the country.”

The initiative is designed as “a mechanism to support the integration and coordination of federal government policies and actions, in alignment with subnational entities, and in dialogue with civil society and the productive sector.”

One of the policy’s highlights is the creation of the National Energy Transition Forum (Fonte) —a unique platform for debate and recommendations to the CNPE, ensuring that Brazil’s energy transition process is fair, inclusive, and democratic. Combating energy poverty is a central element of this approach.

The participating entities have already been indicated, and the definition of the representative of each one is in progress, making Fonte one of the largest forums for debate between the government, the productive sector and representatives of civil society in the country.

The PNTE aligns with “the objectives of the national energy policy for the rational use of energy sources in accordance with international climate commitments assumed by the country.” It also incorporates “other public policy objectives, including initiatives and strategies to enable the ecological transformation of the Brazilian economy, strengthen production chains, add value domestically, and advance climate change mitigation and adaptation.”

(Tank Terminals) Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) has commissioned a demonstration plant for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at its Visakh Refinery, marking a significant milestone in India’s clean aviation journey. The facility will manufacture SAF by co-processing used cooking oil (UCO) in the refinery’s Full Conversion Hydrocracker Unit, making use of existing infrastructure.

Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri said on Friday that the initiative moves India closer to achieving its SAF blending goals of 1 per cent by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028, and 5 per cent by 2030. He noted that the project reflects the country’s steady progress towards cleaner and more sustainable aviation fuels under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

According to HPCL’s roadmap, following CORSIA certification, the Visakh Refinery is expected to produce around 10 thousand metric tonnes (TMT) of SAF annually from January 2027. The production will contribute to India’s efforts to decarbonise the aviation sector while advancing a circular, waste-to-wealth economy.

The initiative is expected to enhance India’s energy self-reliance, align domestic fuel production with global CORSIA standards, and support the country’s Net-Zero emissions commitments.

The general story is a hill-shaped curve: as poor countries industrialise and move away from agrarian economies, GDP emissions per capita rise rapidly.
They should also support making it easier to build renewable energy, nuclear, grid connections, transmission and public transport – the infrastructure of modern, green economies.
When it comes to growth and climate action, a free lunch is on the table: we just need to grasp it.","One of the best arguments against economic growth is the impact it has on the environment. Or, at least, it was one of the best arguments until about 2009. Since then, at least for developed economies, the reverse has been true: higher growth is now associated with reduced carbon emissions. For a Labour government that is “obsessed” with growth, but has also set itself strict climate targets, this is surely welcome news.

To address a potential objection head-on, the reductions in emissions among advanced economies are not because of “outsourcing” carbon-intensive production to poorer countries. The graphs below include “consumption-based” emissions, shown by the light greyline in each, which have also fallen relatively consistently, even as GDP per capita has increased.

The general story is a hill-shaped curve: as poor countries industrialise and move away from agrarian economies, GDP emissions per capita rise rapidly. But as developed economies grow, per capita emissions begin to fall again. We can track this pathway for several countries at different stages of the journey. China and India’s per capita emissions continue to rise, but their trajectories do not look so different to those of Britain, France and Germany 100-150 years ago.

Why do richer countries experience this reduction in emissions? There are several reasons, but the underlying story is that richer states can invest their wealth in decarbonisation. They can afford to move away from fossil fuels towards greener alternatives, such as wind and solar, and electrify more of the economy. This decarbonisation is not necessarily altruistic: many greener technologies, from nuclear to high-speed rail, are more efficient in the long run, but require more upfront investment. Green technologies are also often better for air quality and public health, and can reduce geopolitical dependence on the Middle East (for oil) and Russia (for gas). Advanced economies also tend to have better regulations, including clean air laws; incentives to encourage decarbonisation (like emissions trading) and discourage waste; better management of demand; more recycling; and more efficient transport and appliances.

A similar story holds at a household level. In any economy, as a poor family becomes richer, their carbon emissions tend to increase: they may buy a second car or heat a larger home, fly more, and eat things like carbon-intensive steak. But as medium-income households become richer, their emissions can plateau and even fall. They might insulate their homes or buy energy-efficient appliances, reducing energy consumption. They may move away from fossil fuels altogether by switching to electric cars, heat pumps and solar panels –which are largely the preserve of wealthier consumers, at least in western countries. In fact, in Britain, wealthier households are more likely to take the train and cycle, and rely less on cars to get around.

Globally, the most notable trend towards decarbonisation has been in electricity generation. In this respect, the UK is a leader: coal use for electricity has fallen to zero, and gas is gradually being replaced by wind and solar. Even if Ed Miliband does not hit his goal of clean power by 2030, UK electricity use is already mostly from non-fossil fuel sources. The main challenge now is moving more consumption onto the grid – switching from petrol to electric cars, and gas boilers to heat pumps. Perhaps counterintuitively, increased electricity demand at the right times (i.e. not during winter peaks) can reduce the cost of electricity per unit, since it means that there is more revenue to cover large transmission and other fixed costs. The cost of renewables, at the margin and at the right times, is small: we should make the most of this.

Germany and the US, while more reliant on fossil fuels, have seen similar reductions. China, despite investing heavily in renewables, is still dependent on coal, as is India, which has a more typical ‘energy mix’ for an industrialising country. France, which made a savvy early bet on nuclear, has had a close to carbon-free grid for decades. The point here is not to shame emerging economies: they are following the exact same fossil use path as the UK, US and most of Europe during our periods of industrialisation. Indeed, wealthy western countries are far more to blame for the climate crisis than non-western emerging or middle-income countries. The point is that for wealthy countries like the UK, growth is not only negatively correlated with carbon emissions, but may be actively helpful for decarbonisation. It would be a mistake to claim that the solution for climate change is for wealthy, western countries to grow less, as is advocated by some ‘degrowths’, and indeed many more mainstream progressives.

To make this more concrete, consider the biggest barriers to reducing emissions in Britain. Two of the biggest sources are domestic transport – i.e. petrol cars – and “buildings and product uses,” which mainly refers togas-based heating of buildings. In both cases, we already have the technology to go green. Electric cars not only exist, but are in many ways a superior product to petrol cars – they’re quieter, accelerate quicker and, in the long run, can cost less to run. Similarly, heat pumps could entirely replace gas boilers, with the bonus that they can provide air cooling in the summer as well as heating in the winter.

But in both cases, the biggest barrier to EV and heat pump adoption in Britain is cost. Households struggle to cover the upfront cost of buying an electric car or heat pump, even though running costs for both can be low. The British state does not have enough fiscal headroom to subsidise EVs and heat pumps, or invest in the infrastructure for charging points across the country. With a couple of exceptions, the countries with the highest EV adoption in Europe tend to be the wealthiest: places like Norway, the Netherlands and Switzerland have far higher adoption than Italy, Spain and Greece. Likewise, it is the wealthiest households that are most able to pay for a heat pump, or install solar panels on their homes.

Wealthier countries with greater state capacity can also invest in greener infrastructure across the board. Investment might be in production (subsidising nuclear or wind farms, for instance); grid connections and transmission; adoption of technologies such as EVs and heat pumps; or better demand management (i.e., using insulation, batteries, smart meters and incentives to balance the grid).

Growth can also change our lifestyles in ways that reduce emissions. Investing in bicycle lanes, trains, trams and metros can transform our cities by reducing car dependence. The housing policies which are best for growth – such as residential annexes, street votes, and resident-led estate renewal – tend to be good for reducing emissions too, because they focus on densifying urban areas, which encourages walking and public transport over car use. Densification tends to mean more homes taking up less land, using less energy, and connecting workers to higher productivity jobs and delivering a high-quality of life. Sprawl is the enemy of both growth and conservation.

Then there are more speculative, innovative ways in which growth can help the green transition. As an economy grows, so does the amount spent on research into green technologies. A breakthrough in nuclear fusion, sustainable aviation fuel or next generation geothermal energy could be transformative for helping countries go green – and speed up the transition in developing economies, too. New research could even reduce the carbon impact of agriculture if we find better alternatives to meat.

All this means that there need be no conflict between tackling climate change and the pro-growth, “build baby build” agenda that has been embraced and espoused by this government – so long as we build in the right ways. This should be good news for everyone – eco-warriors and ‘yimbys’ alike. But taking advantage of this alignment of interests will require change from both sides of the debate.

Those of us who care about growth should stop framing it as being in conflict with environmental objectives. Environmentalists, for their part, should welcome higher GDP, and focus their efforts on ensuring this GDP is “spent” on decarbonisation. In particular, environmental groups should welcome several pro-growth planning reforms, such as those that encourage densification, which reduces urban sprawl and increases average home efficiency. They should also support making it easier to build renewable energy, nuclear, grid connections, transmission and public transport – the infrastructure of modern, green economies.

It will always be tempting for politicians to have a fight. Sometimes, it’s helpful to have an enemy –whether it’s “builders versus blockers”, or the bats and newts that increased costs for HS2. But true leadership means identifying win-wins: policies that can command broad, durable support. When it comes to growth and climate action, a free lunch is on the table: we just need to grasp it.

“The SAF Mandate provides certainty to industry by setting a legal framework that establishes the demand for SAF in the U.K.,” the U.K. Department for Transport said in a document announcing the public comment period.
“This call for evidence does not propose any changes to the SAF Mandate,” the government stressed.","The U.K. Department for Transport in late 2025 signaled it may be softening its stance on crop-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The agency is gathering stakeholder input that could provide a pathway to open the country’s SAF Mandate program to crop-based biofuels.

The U.K. Department for Transport on Dec. 22 opened a call for evidence seeking public comments on crop-derived SAF, including SAF produced from energy crops, cover crops, and food and feed crops.

The comment period is related to the U.K.’s primary SAF initiatives, which include a SAF Mandate that came into effect in 2025; the Advanced Fuels Fund, which provides support for first-of-a-kind SAF projects; and a revenue certainty scheme designed to help de-risk “SAF projects.

“The SAF Mandate provides certainty to industry by setting a legal framework that establishes the demand for SAF in the U.K.,” the U.K. Department for Transport said in a document announcing the public comment period. “This certainty facilitates an environment in which commercial decisions can be made confidently, supply chains are developed, and investment is attracted into the sector. Government is committed to maintaining that certainty and confidence and will not propose changes unless a) there is a strong rationale and b) such changes can be made that are consistent with wider government objectives, in a way that maintains policy stability and investor confidence.”

According to the U.K. government, the SAF industry is undergoing rapid expansion. As the SAF market developments, the government will need to ensure the SAF Mandate delivers genuine greenhouse gas (GHG) savings while minimizing cost impacts for consumers; aligns with the U.K.’s overall process toward future carbon budgets; interacts effectively with other low carbon fuel support mechanisms; facilitate the development of domestic production; and keeps up with technical developments while proving the certainty needed to create an attractive investment environment.

The effort to gather public input on the use of crops in SAF production is part of the government’s effort to meet those goals, focusing on “feedstock availability and cost of crop-derived SAF production, the impacts of crop-derived SAF production on U.K. industry, and sustainability risks and how regulation may be able to mitigate against these.”

The U.K.’s SAF Mandate is divided into two main parts—the main obligation and a power-to-liquids obligation. For 2025, the main obligation was set at 2% of total fossil jet fuel supplied. The mandate increases annually to 9.5% in 2030 and 18.5% in 2040. The power-to-liquid obligation begins at 0.2% in 2028 and expands to 3.5% in 2040.

The mandate also includes a cap on the amount of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) that can be used to meet the main obligation. HEFA can bs used to meet 100% of the obligation in 2025 and 2026, falling to 71% in 2030 and 35% in 2040.

The U.K.’s SAF Mandate includes strict sustainability criteria, requiring that eligible SAF meet made from sustainable biogenic wastes or residues, such as used cooking oil or rood waste; recycled carbon fuels, such as unrecyclable plastics; or be power-to-liquid fuels made using low carbon energy, such as renewable energy or nuclear power. Currently, SAF produced from crops cannot participate in the mandate. The exclusion includes food, feed, energy or cover crops.

All SAF used to meet the mandate must achieve a 40% GHG reduction. Specific sustainable criteria also apply to certain types of feedstocks, including criteria related to biodiversity, carbon stocks, protected lands, soil carbon, and sustainable waste management.

While crop-based SAF is currently unable to participate in the U.K.’s SAF Mandate, the government is signaling it may be softening its stance on that exclusion by providing stakeholders who have new or improved evidence on crop feedstocks an opportunity to formally submit it to the U.K. Department for Transport. The call for evidence focuses on the potential benefits, risk and trade-offs of using crops in SAF production.

“This call for evidence does not propose any changes to the SAF Mandate,” the government stressed. “In light of the responses to this call for evidence, should there be a case to review the feedstock eligibility criteria, it would be subject to consultation and any changes would require amendments to legislation.

The call for evidence focuses primarily on the energy crops, cover crops and food and feed crops, but the government also indicated it is welcoming comments on crops the respondent does not consider to be covered by those categories.

The call for evidence launched Dec. 22, 2025. Comments can be filed with the U.K. government through March 16.

Welcome to Helicopter Investor’s news round up of stories you may have missed over the festive period. Featuring in our news list are manufacturers, operators and dealers.

Starting with manufacturers, state-owned Indian aerospace and defence company Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) confirmed at the end of last year the maiden flight of its updated Dhruv ‘New Gen’ (NG) helicopter.

Designed and manufactured by HAL, the 5.5t Dhruv NG is a light twin-engine, multi-role helicopter engineered for Indian terrain. Powered by two Shakti 1H1C engines, the helicopter includes a civil-certified glass cockpit (compliant to AS4 requirements), modern avionics and a range of safety features.

The company’s chief MD D K Sunil said: “Dhruv ‘New Gen’ helicopter is the cornerstone of HAL’s civil expansion. The Dhruv Mk 1 Civil platform has already clocked over 24,000 hours and has been specifically upgraded to meet the rigorous demands of the global civil aviation market, marking a milestone in India’s indigenous rotary-wing capability.”

Airbus Helicopters revealed an order for 100 helicopters from the Spanish Ministry of Defence. From that total, and in addition to military deployments, 13 H135 helicopters will be used for light utility missions. A further 50 H145M assets will be used for light utility and disaster relief. Six super-medium H175Ms will be tasked with governmental missions, including the transport of authorities.

The manufacturer also revealed how it is working with French operator SAF (Service Aérien Français) Hélicoptères to promote the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using book and claim. The partners are promoting the use of SAF with the deployment of two H145 helicopters for emergency medical services (EMS) missions in Catalonia, Spain.

“Under the terms of our service contract with the Catalan Department of Health’s Emergency Medical Services, we provide two H145 helicopters along with the pilots, technical aircrew, line maintenance and training,” explains SAF Hélicoptères co-director, Jean-Louis Camus. “These two helicopters support two hospital bases, which in turn supply the medical teams.”

Bell Textron announced the delivery of a second Bell 505 to the Fort Worth Police Department. Bell’s partnership with the city of Fort Worth dates back almost 75 years. “All of us at Bell value our long-standing relationships with the city of Fort Worth and the Fort Worth Police Department, and we are proud to be a partner in supporting the city’s public safety initiatives and advancing the department’s impact with this added capability,” said Danny Maldonado, chief commercial officer and incoming Bell CEO. “Nearly 75 years after Bell’s move to Fort Worth, this city remains home for us, and we look forward to seeing this new aircraft serve the citizens of Fort Worth.”

Leonardo Helicopters successfully completed the maiden flight of its Next Generation Civil Tiltrotor (NGCTR) technology demonstrator at the company’s Cascina Costa facility in northern Italy towards the end of last month.

Based the manufacturer’s AW609 tiltrotor, the new aircraft is planned as a airborne laboratory rather than the forerunner of a production aircraft.

Logistics firm B&H Worldwide revealed its role in transporting two new Airbus H145 rescue helicopters to New Zealand. The aircraft will supporting the fleet renewal programme of the Canterbury West Coast Air Rescue Trust and GCH Aviation.

When fully commissioned, the helicopters will support emergency medical, accident response, inter-hospital transfer and search-and-rescue missions across the Canterbury, West Coast, Nelson and Marlborough regions, where rescue helicopters respond to more than 1,700 missions each year.

Christine Prince, CEO, Canterbury West Coast Air Rescue Trust, said: “Bringing these helicopters into service has been an enormous undertaking, but our communities deserve a world-class rescue helicopter service. These new aircraft will significantly enhance the care and support we can provide to people in their most critical moments.”

Rotortrade, the helicopter dealer, MRO and finance firm revealed its plan to open a new maintenance, sales and services hub in Riyadh named the Rotortrade Helipark. The facility will span 6,000sqm over three floors, with multiple helipads, sales display areas, a premium hospitality zone and a fully integrated service centre for Airbus and Leonardo services.

Hyderabad, India, Jan. 06, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to Mordor Intelligence, the renewable diesel market is valued to rise from USD 33.91 billion in 2025 to USD 50.26 billion by 2030, expanding at a CAGR of 8.19%. Once viewed as a niche biofuel, renewable diesel is now emerging as a practical replacement for conventional diesel, especially in long-haul transport, marine operations, and backup power systems due to its drop-in usability.

Policy incentives such as California’s LCFS and Europe’s RED III continue to support profitability, while low-cost refinery upgrades are speeding up capacity growth. Demand from sustainable aviation fuel production and large data-center generators is further strengthening market resilience, even as electrification advances in parallel.

Emerging Trends and Developments

Backup Power for Digital Infrastructure Gains Traction

Data centers are emerging as a new demand segment as operators seek cleaner options for backup generation. Renewable diesel is being used in large-scale generators with minimal impact on reliability, helping operators meet environmental commitments. This diversification beyond transportation adds resilience and higher-value opportunities to the overall market.

Seamless Use Across Existing Diesel Systems

Renewable diesel closely resembles conventional diesel, allowing it to move through current pipelines, storage, and engines without modifications or blending limits. This makes adoption simple for fleet operators, who can avoid infrastructure upgrades while maintaining reliable performance, even in cold climates. Its sulfur-free nature also helps marine operators comply with emission norms without additional equipment, strengthening its position against fuels that require entirely new distribution networks.

Rising Use in Heavy-Duty Transport

For sectors where electrification remains challenging, renewable diesel offers an immediate pathway to lower emissions without sacrificing range or performance. Trucking, construction, and off-road fleets are increasingly adopting it as a practical solution, benefiting smoother operations and reduced maintenance concerns while progressing toward sustainability goals.

Regional Overview

North America continues to lead in revenue share, supported by long-standing low-carbon fuel incentives, ample agricultural inputs, and fast uptake among heavy-duty fleet operators. At the same time, aggressive capacity additions have sparked discussions around potential oversupply, encouraging producers to explore export routes. Competition for limited waste-based feedstocks between the United States and Canada remains a key vulnerability for the region.

Europe stands out as the fastest-moving market, powered by stricter transport decarbonization rules and rising sustainable aviation fuel mandates. Several countries are expanding advanced biorefineries that integrate with existing industrial hubs to improve efficiency. While alternative feedstocks from forestry residues help ease pressure, the region is increasingly reliant on imports, prompting closer scrutiny of supply traceability.

Zacks Investment Research The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Alto Ingredients ALTO has experienced a sustained decline in sales over the past several years, primarily due to lower average sales prices per gallon and reduced volumes of essential ingredients sold. Weak oil and gasoline prices have put pressure on ethanol pricing, while lower alcohol production and reduced corn prices have led to fewer tons of essential ingredients being marketed.

As a commodity-linked business, ALTO’s revenues remain highly sensitive to ethanol price movements, corn input costs and demand from fuel blenders and industrial end markets. Sales declines have been evident across all major segments, including the Pekin Campus, Marketing and Distribution, and Western Production operations.

Alto has idled or exited underperforming facilities and low-margin contracts to preserve liquidity and stabilize profitability, resulting in revenue contraction.

Despite ongoing top-line pressure, Alto’s turnaround strategy is encouraging. It has expanded beyond commodity ethanol into higher-value specialty alcohols and essential ingredients serving pharmaceutical, personal care, food, and industrial markets. This is intended to reduce earnings volatility and lessen dependence on fuel ethanol pricing. Alto is expanding carbon dioxide capture and utilization at its Pekin and Columbia facilities, building on the Carbonic acquisition. Monetizing fermentation-derived CO2 provides an incremental, higher-margin revenue stream aligned with sustainability initiatives.

Alto continues to streamline its cost structure, exit unprofitable activities and prioritize capital investments with near-term visibility. Although sales are expected to decline in 2025, a turnaround is expected this year.

What About Its Peers?

Green Plains Inc. GPRE has experienced uneven sales due to fluctuating ethanol prices, shifting fuel demand and commodity volatility. Green Plains is reshaping its business mix toward higher-margin protein and renewable ingredients, which has weighed on short-term sales but is expected to improve stability. Green Plains aims to reduce exposure to ethanol cyclicality through diversification.

Gevo, Inc. GEVO continues to generate modest sales as it advances renewable fuel and sustainable aviation fuel projects. Gevo’s revenues remain limited by development timelines and delayed offtake ramp-ups, reflecting its early-stage model. Nonetheless, Gevo expects sales growth as projects reach commercialization.

ALTO’s Price Performance

Alto Ingredients has gained 45.4% in a year, outperforming the industry, sector as well as the Zacks S&P 500 composite.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has released updated estimates for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, highlighting challenges in scaling the industry. In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (2.4 billion litres), double the 1 million tonnes produced in 2024. Growth is projected to slow in 2026, reaching 2.4 million tonnes. Despite this increase, SAF will account for only 0.6 per cent of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, rising to 0.8 per cent in 2026. At current prices, the SAF premium will add approximately USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs for the airline industry in 2025.

The downward revision from earlier forecasts reflects insufficient policy support to fully utilise installed SAF capacities. SAF costs exceed conventional jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to five in mandated markets.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonisation of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.

Mandates in the EU and UK have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption. In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have raised profit margins so that airlines pay up to five times the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF, without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation. In the UK, SAF mandates have also triggered price spikes, forcing airlines to absorb significant costs. In total, airlines paid a premium of USD 2.9 billion for the limited 1.9 million tonnes of SAF available in 2025.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognise that its approach is not working and urgently correct course. The recent European Commission STIP announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter,” said Walsh.

The shortfall in SAF supply will force many airlines to review their 2030 SAF commitments. “Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10 per cent SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” said Walsh.",https://decarbonfuse.com/assets/favi/favicon-32x32-b1c94ae87840c662751403aefa5b6ea92417e97aab4cbce5a1b99c4e112cac36.png,N,,2026-01-07 06:12:34.755443

That brought Elizabeth Cantwell, formerly of Utah State University, to Pullman.
She’s excited to watch and cheer on WSU, and the Tri-Cities campus, only this time from the sidelines.","For the first time in more than 20 years, Lura Powell doesn’t have an official meeting to attend.

The retired federal civil servant and former director of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has served on various boards and commissions since moving to the Tri-Cities to join PNNL.

“It’s been constant,” said Powell, who wrapped up her last major commitment when her nearly 12-year tenure on the Washington State University Board of Regents came to an end this past fall.

“I just felt when my term was up, I was going to leave.”

Her time as a regent was never without excitement. From helping to establish WSU’s medical school in Spokane to helping to hire two new university presidents, Powell said she’s seen a lot change in the WSU system and at the Tri-Cities campus specifically, with more likely to come.

“I am very encouraged and bullish about the future of our campus here,” said Powell, who was named the 2023 Tri-Citian of the Year.

Powell hails from Maryland and worked in the federal government before moving west.

She was director of the Advanced Technology Program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology for the U.S. Department of Commerce, where she oversaw a high-risk technology investment portfolio.

She also chaired the Biotechnology Research Committee of the National Science and Technology Council, which coordinated biotechnology research across the federal government.

Wanting a change, she accepted the PNNL position in Richland, which is operated by Battelle on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy. She oversaw the region’s largest employer from 2000-03.

After PNNL, she wasn’t idle long. Former Gov. Christine Gregoire named her the first chair of the state’s Life Sciences Discovery Fund Authority in 2006. That was followed by her leading the state’s redistricting commission in 2011 to redraw Washington’s legislative and congressional districts to match the latest census data.

Then, in 2014, former Gov. Jay Inslee appointed Powell as a WSU regent, replacing another prominent Tri-Citian, attorney Fran Forgette.

Then-WSU President Elson S. Floyd didn’t waste any time in tapping Powell for a crucial initiative for the university system.

“I was driving back from regent training when President Floyd called and asked me to be on a commission to discuss medical education in Spokane,” Powell said.

Floyd had been pushing to establish a medical school for WSU as the state faced a doctor shortage, with the University of Washington the only university with a medical school in the state at the time.

Powell and the other regents determined WSU was in a solid position to operate its own medical school, helping to convince the state Legislature to amend the state law in 2015 to allow its formation. Only months later, Floyd died of complications of colon cancer.

“It was a heavy lift to get that medical school, and he just gave it his all,” Powell said.

Powell and her fellow regents also led the committee to search for the late Floyd’s replacement, bringing on then-President Kirk Schulz from Kansas State University.

“It was up to him to make sure (the medical school) got started and started well,” she said. “The results have been fantastic with graduates by and large staying in state,” though, she added, launching such the program put a financial strain on the university.

Then the Covid-19 pandemic hit, creating new challenges for enrollment, retention and funding.

Once the pandemic was largely in the rear view, WSU’s athletic conference, the Pac-12, imploded in 2022 and 2023, putting the university, Schulz and the regents on the defensive. WSU and the only other remaining Pac-12 member, Oregon State University, recruited seven new members to join conference athletic play in the 2026-27 season.

“It’s been challenging but wow what an interesting time,” Powell said. “I never had a chance to be bored.”

Kirk retired in early 2025 and Powell once again was part of the search for WSU’s next president. That brought Elizabeth Cantwell, formerly of Utah State University, to Pullman. Powell praised Cantwell’s deep experience working with national labs, strong communication and organizational skills. All of that is needed right now as the university wrestles with the politicization of higher education and research funding at the national level.

“We have the right person at the right time,” she said.

And while the regents’ top priorities are serving the WSU system as a whole, Powell acknowledged she had the Tri-Cities campus in mind throughout her tenure.

“I took opportunities to educate others about all the things the Tri-Cities is doing,” she said. “And I will say, that under Chancellor (Sandra) Haynes, that campus has just blossomed.”

WSU Tri-Cities has seen enrollment growth the other campuses have not, and it has become a focal point of efforts around energy research such as nuclear and sustainable aviation fuel.

“I think this is our time,” she said.

Powell is hopeful her regent replacement will be another Tri-Citian, but she’s ready to look ahead and happy to have more time to focus on her family and other projects, noting the volume of email she receives has gone down significantly.

She’s excited to watch and cheer on WSU, and the Tri-Cities campus, only this time from the sidelines.

“I wouldn’t have traded it for anything. It was a wonderful experience,” Powell said.",https://www.tricitiesbusinessnews.com/ext/resources/2025/12/17/Laura-Powell.jpg?height=635&t=1767378815&width=1200,N,,2026-01-06 17:56:56.281823

The future of agricultural mechanization: Planning, innovation, and financing

The agricultural machinery sector faces a landscape with strong growth potential, driven by the expansion of cultivated areas and an outdated fleet. However, this potential is constrained by high credit costs, international volatility, and reliance on public resources.

In 2024, the sector’s revenue reached BRL 62 billion. The projection for 2025 is BRL 68 billion, representing a 10% increase. Despite this, financing totaled BRL 27.6 billion, with only 36% benefiting from subsidized interest rates, well below the historical average of 60%.

Within this context, the capital markets have taken a leading role. Instruments such as Rural Product Notes (“CPR”), Agribusiness Receivables Certificates (“CRA”), Agribusiness Credit Bills (“LCA”), and Investment Funds in Agribusiness Production Chains (“FIAGRO”) grew by more than 300% between 2022 and 2024, offering an almost unlimited source of funding. The future points to hybrid models, combining subsidized credit and private financing, creating the conditions for innovation and modernization.

To secure the future of agricultural mechanization, the goal is clear: strategic planning must look beyond the next harvest and focus on the coming decades, accelerating the transition to new financing models and guaranteeing global competitiveness.

Third EcoInvest auction offers agribusiness opportunities

At the close of 2025, the third EcoInvest auction was held – a government program that combines public and private capital to boost sustainable projects. This edition mapped approximately 15 segments, with an emphasis on agribusiness chains, such as biofuel production (SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel, biogas and biomethane, bioinputs, and biofertilizers).

Financial institutions interested in participating can submit proposals by January 07, 2026.

The major innovation in this edition is EcoInvest’s entry into equity investments, in addition to traditional debt instruments. The goal is to structure investment funds similar to private equity, with allocations distributed over a five-year period. These funds must include at least 15% foreign investors and allocate 20% to early-stage companies (venture capital companies). If this percentage cannot be met, resources may be directed to institutions such as Embrapii and Scientific, Technological, and Innovation Institutions (“ICTs”).

The model establishes that the Brazilian National Treasury will transfer resources to banks at an annual interest rate of 1%. Half of the subsidized amount will remain in the banks’ treasury. These institutions must use part of the spread (the difference between the cost of borrowed funds and their yield) to purchase foreign exchange derivatives, thus offering protection to foreign investors against the appreciation of the Brazilian real over five years. The other half will be allocated to EcoInvest investment funds at an annual cost of 5%, either through proprietary asset managers or partner companies.

These resources will be injected into the fund (either via loans or quota subscription), but will not be used to finance operations. Instead, they must remain invested, and any excess return will serve as a support to attract additional capital. The idea is to establish a first-loss mechanism that mitigates portfolio risk in high-risk projects.

Through this structure, EcoInvest aims to attract private capital and reduce risk, providing opportunities for large sector aggregators and encouraging innovation in agribusiness and environmentally sustainable projects.

BNDES estimates BRL 73.7 billion in sustainable investments following public call on climate

The Brazilian Development Bank (“BNDES”) announced that its public call for climate mitigation initiatives has the potential to attract BRL 73.7 billion in sustainable investments, having received 45 proposals from investment funds.

The initiative seeks to combine public and private resources to accelerate the energy transition and reduce carbon emissions, aligning Brazil with global decarbonization and sustainable development goals.

The proposals request BRL 21 billion in financial support from BNDES and cover initiatives in energy transition, green agriculture, climate infrastructure, reforestation, industrial process decarbonization, and forest conservation. The public call aims to identify projects with high potential for positive environmental impact and economic feasibility, creating a robust pipeline to attract domestic and international investors.

According to BNDES’ chair, the strategy involves structuring five to six funds in which BNDES Participações (“BNDESPAR”) would contribute up to 25% of the funds’ total capital, attracting the remaining resources from the market. “We aim to invest approximately BRL 5 billion and leverage an additional BRL 15 billion from the private sector. The response exceeded expectations: 45 proposals totaling BRL 73.7 billion demonstrate Brazil’s innovation strength and potential to accelerate the green economy,” stated BNDES’ chair.

Beyond environmental impact, BNDES emphasizes that selected projects are expected to generate social and economic benefits, such as job creation, regional development, and productive inclusion. This initiative is expected to support Brazil’s consolidation as a leader in climate solutions in Latin America, drawing foreign capital and fostering strategic partnerships.

Currently, BNDESPAR has BRL 8.4 billion allocated to funds and, with the new selection, this amount can increase by up to 60%. With this, BNDES reinforces its role as a catalyst for sustainable investments, promoting a development model that combines economic competitiveness with environmental responsibility.

Soy Moratorium: CADE expands investigation to individuals, but STF orders suspension of proceedings

The future of the Soy Moratorium – one of the main environmental agreements in Brazilian agribusiness – remains uncertain amid escalating disputes between regulatory agencies, the production sector, and the Judiciary.

On September 30, 2025, the Brazilian Competition Authority (“CADE”) had provisionally lifted the preventive measure that halted the pact, ensuring the validity of the moratorium until December 31 and allowing negotiations among the parties. However, the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court (“STF”) has recently granted an injunction ordering the suspension of administrative proceedings regarding the legality or constitutionality of the Soy Moratorium.

In early November, CADE broadened the scope of its investigation by initiating a new administrative inquiry against 15 individuals associated with companies that had signed the agreement, seeking to determine the personal liability of executives and representatives in the implementation and monitoring of the moratorium. This measure represents an expansion of the investigations, which had previously focused on the companies and associations involved.

Within the Judiciary, the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (“ABIOVE”) – an entity representing Brazil’s leading soybean traders and processors – filed a petition within the scope of Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (“ADI”) No. 7774. This lawsuit, currently pending before the STF, challenges the constitutionality of a state law in Mato Grosso related to granting tax incentives to companies adhering to the pact. It further requests the suspension of all judicial and administrative proceedings in Brazil that directly or indirectly address the legality of the Soy Moratorium, due to the risk of conflicting decisions and legal uncertainty for the sector.

Within this context, Justice Flávio Dino, the reporting officer of ADI No. 7774, granted an injunction on November 05, 2025, ordering the suspension of all judicial and administrative proceedings concerning the legality or constitutionality of the Soy Moratorium until the STF issues a final ruling. The decision was endorsed by a majority of the justices, who recognized the relevance of the matter and its potential economic and environmental impacts.

In compliance with the STF order, CADE published a decision on November 11, 2025, suspending any administrative proceedings related to the Soy Moratorium. As a result, all investigations and administrative measures will remain on hold until the STF delivers a definitive judgment, placing the future of this environmental pact in the hands of Brazil’s highest court.

TAX REGULATION:

New law enacted establishing dividend taxation, minimum income tax, and exemptions

On November 27, 2025, Law No. 15,270/2025 (converted from Bill No. 1,087/2025) was published, introducing taxation on dividends, the Minimum Individual Income Tax (“IRPFM”), and expanding the Individual Income Tax (“IRPF”) exemption for earnings up to BRL 5,000.

These changes require close attention from taxpayers (including those in the agribusiness sector), particularly regarding potential measures that may still be adopted in 2025 to reduce exposure to the new dividend taxation, which will take effect as of 2026.

Brazilian Federal Revenue Service launches new compliance initiative targeting individuals in the rural sector

The Federal Revenue Service of Brazil (“RFB”) has initiated a new phase of its compliance program, targeting individuals engaged in rural activities, with a specific focus on income derived from lease agreements for rural real estate.

The initiative, named “Declara Agro – Arrendamentos”, aims to guide taxpayers on the correct taxation of such income, supporting self-assessment and regularization. According to the RFB, taxpayers who comply and correct their returns by January 30, 2026, will avoid official penalties.

STF resumes debate on tax incentives for pesticides

In a session held on November 19, 2025, the STF resumed the trial of Direct Actions of Unconstitutionality (ADI No. 5553 and ADI No. 7755) challenging the tax benefits granted to agricultural pesticides, particularly the exemptions from the Tax on the Circulation of Goods and Services (“ICMS”) and the Tax on Industrialized Products (“IPI”) provided under ICMS Agreement No. 100/1997 and provisions of Constitutional Amendment No. 132/2023.

The new session exposed a three‑way division within the Court:

The reporting officer, Justice Edson Fachin, supported by Justice Cármen Lúcia, voted to declare the incentives unconstitutional based on the principles of environmental and health protection, supporting the State’s duty not to subsidize products deemed harmful.

In dissent, Justice Cristiano Zanin aligned himself with Justices Luiz Fux and Dias Toffoli, recognizing the full validity of the benefits as legitimate instruments of agricultural policy and competitiveness.

Justice Flávio Dino, aligning with Justice André Mendonça, issued a partial dissent in which he recognized the constitutionality of tax incentives for agricultural inputs, arguing that Constitutional Amendment No. 132/2023 had incorporated this policy into the Constitution.

In light of the divergent positions and the relevance of the tax, environmental, and agricultural matters involved, the trial was suspended and will be resumed at a later date Among the issues that remain unresolved are whether periodic review of the benefits will be required, the compatibility between favorable tax treatment and environmental protection, and the financial implications for states and producers.

State of São Paulo introduces new tax benefits for yeast-derived products

The Government of the State of São Paulo has published Decree No. 70,024/2025, introducing significant changes to the São Paulo State ICMS Regulation (“RICMS-SP”).

The decree establishes specific tax rules for domestic transactions involving yeast-derived products, classified under MERCOSUR’s Common Nomenclature (“NCM”) 2102.20.00 and originating from the sugarcane fermentation process.

The regulation introduces two provisions to the state tax code:

Article 361-A – ICMS deferral on first sale:

The ICMS deferral will now apply to the first domestic sale of inactive dry, autolyzed, hydrolyzed, cell wall, and extracted yeast. This mechanism postpones the ICMS collection to the following stage in the supply chain, thus reducing the immediate financial impact on manufacturers and distributors.

Annex I, Article 183 – Exemption for pet food production:

Domestic transactions involving the same products will be exempt from ICMS when destined exclusively for the production of pet food, reinforcing policies aimed at stimulating the pet segment and agroindustrial chains linked to sugarcane.

The decree took effect on November 01, 2025, allowing companies in the sector to adjust their processes and evaluate opportunities to leverage new incentives.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION:

Legal Reserve

GOIÁS

Goiás establishes procedures for analysis and approval of Legal Reserve

On November 03, 2025, the State Secretariat for Environment and Sustainable Development (“SEMAD”) published SEMAD Normative Instruction No. 23/2025, providing for administrative procedures and technical criteria for the analysis and approval of the Legal Reserve. The normative instruction also provides for the rules for relocation, compensation, and implementation of collective or condominium Legal Reserves.

The regulation stipulates that the analysis and approval of Legal Reserves will be carried out through the Rural Environmental Registry (“CAR”), except in cases provided for in the normative instruction. It further defines technical criteria for location, prioritizing areas with greater conservation of native vegetation, less fragmentation, and connectivity with other protected areas.

Additionally, the normative instruction regulates procedures for environmental licensing, establishing that the Legal Reserve approval may occur within the scope of land-use conversion, including the conditions for title rectifications and CAR updates. It also establishes rules for off‑property relocation, compensation, and the creation of collective Legal Reserves, requiring, among other conditions, that they be located within the same biome and expanded in area to ensure environmental gains.

Finally, the normative instruction provides for compensation rules in cases of vegetation suppression, as well as criteria for regularization and integration of control systems, ensuring compliance with state and federal legislation.

Rural Insurance

FEDERAL

National Council of Private Insurance establishes environmental, social, and climate guidelines for rural insurance

On November 04, 2025, the National Council of Private Insurance (“CNSP”) published CNSP Resolution No. 485/2025, establishing guidelines on environmental, social, and climate-related issues applicable to rural insurance.

The regulation requires that areas covered by rural insurance contracts be identified by geodetic coordinates and registered in the CAR. It prohibits the execution of contracts for real estate not registered or with suspended registration, as well as for activities in areas embargoed by environmental authorities or located in conservation units, Indigenous lands, Quilombola communities, or undesignated public forests, except as provided for in specific exceptions.

The resolution also prohibits contracting by policyholders listed in the registry of employers who have subjected workers to conditions analogous to slavery, establishes risk mitigation criteria, requires insurers to comply with the guidelines before underwriting, and further mandates specific clauses in contracts for reporting non-compliance.

The regulation will take effect 180 days after publication and authorizes the Superintendence of Private Insurance (“SUSEP”) to issue complementary regulations for its implementation.

Environmental Rural Registry

PARANÁ

Paraná establishes procedures for automated analysis of Rural Environmental Registry

On November 03, 2025, the Government of the State of Paraná published Decree No. 11,711/2025, establishing procedures for applying Articles 3 and 13 of Law No. 18,295/2014, with a focus on streamlining the analysis of information declared in CAR at the state level.

The regulation introduces mechanisms for the automated CAR analysis, enabling corrections and adjustments based on certified cartographic data, satellite imagery, and official technical criteria, with the aim of enhancing speed and accuracy in the environmental regularization of rural real estate.

The decree defines concepts such as the National Rural Environmental Registry System (“SICAR”), the Environmental Regularization Program (“PRA”), and the Degraded Area Recovery Project (“PRADA”). It also provides that the automated analysis may correct information regarding Permanent Preservation Areas (“APPs”), Legal Reserves, restricted-use areas, and administrative easements, without prior request.

Additionally, any real estate with its CAR analyzed and deemed compliant may request the cancellation of annotations related to commitment terms recorded in real estate registries. The state will offer free technical assistance to owners of real estate – including up to four fiscal modules – and may enter into cooperation agreements for the preparation of PRADAs and regularization measures.

RIO GRANDE DO SUL

Rio Grande do Sul regulates procedures for analysis and validation of the Rural Environmental Registry

On November 19, 2025, the State Secretariat for Environment and Infrastructure in collaboration with the Henrique Luiz Roessler State Foundation for Environmental Protection (“FEPAM”) published SEMA/FEPAM Joint Normative Instruction No. 9/2025, establishing administrative procedures for the analysis, validation, amendment, and cancellation of rural real estate registrations in the Rural Environmental Registry (“CAR”).

The regulation defines the procedures for validating the information submitted to the CAR for the purpose of certifying the environmental compliance of rural real estate with existing legislation, particularly in relation to APPs, Legal Reserves, restricted‑use zones, and consolidated areas. It also specifies that the analysis will be conducted through the SICAR module, with the option to use automated mechanisms and state cartographic databases. The normative instruction creates the Owner/Holder Portal as the official channel for monitoring analyses as well as submitting documents and corrections. Additionally, it establishes the CAR Management Committee, responsible for defining technical criteria and monitoring the progress of ongoing analyses.

Among its key provisions, the instruction outlines procedures for validating property boundaries, permissible area discrepancies, and overlaps with settlements, Indigenous lands, conservation units, and embargoed areas..

The normative instruction also sets deadlines for responding to notifications (120 days) and provides for the cancellation of the CAR after one year of suspension due to a lack of regularization. The regulation addresses the analysis of land use and cover, APPs, and Legal Reserves, establishing criteria for issuing notifications and requiring supporting documentation, as well as rules for amendments to registrations and for CAR cancellation in specific cases, such as overlaps or improper registration.

The regulation reinforces that, while the environmental authority has not ruled on pending issues, CAR registrations will be considered effective for all legal purposes. The normative instruction also authorizes field inspections and requires that registration information be updated whenever there is a change in ownership or possession. With these measures, the state aims to ensure greater legal certainty and transparency in the CAR validation process, aligning it with the Forest Code and federal regulations.

MINAS GERAIS

Minas Gerais establishes guidelines for CAR analysis and regularization of Legal Reserve areas

On November 19, 2025, the State Secretariat for Environment and Sustainable Development (“SEMAD”), the State Environmental Foundation (“FEAM”), and the State Forestry Institute (“IEF”) published SEMAD/FEAM/IEF Joint Resolution No. 3,390/2025, establishing procedures for the analysis of the CAR of rural real estate in Minas Gerais and specifying the documentation required to support regularization processes of Legal Reserve areas.

The regulation establishes technical and administrative criteria for validating information declared in the CAR, including verification of real estate boundaries, APPs, consolidated areas, anthropized areas, and the location of Legal Reserves. The analysis will be conducted through the SICAR analysis module, prioritizing real estate associated with environmental licensing, intervention authorizations, or judicial proceedings. Notifications may be submitted via the Owner/Holder Portal, with a 120-day period for corrections, under penalty of registry suspension.

The regulation also sets permissible limits for discrepancies in area measurements and overlaps with other real estate, settlements, conservation units, and Indigenous territories, as well as rules for automatic rectification by the environmental authority in specific cases.

Finally, the regulation reinforces that the CAR registration is a prerequisite for Legal Reserve regularization and that previous administrative acts will be observed, ensuring legal certainty. The resolution also repeals SEMAD/IEF Joint Resolutions No. 3,132/2022 and SEMAD/FEAM/IEF No. 3,353/2025.

TOCANTINS

Tocantins establishes new geospatial bases for CAR analysis

On November 12, 2025, the Nature Institute of Tocantins (“NATURATINS”) published Ordinance No. 265/2025, providing for the adoption of new official geospatial vector bases for CAR registrations in the state of Tocantins.

The measure took effect on December 01, 2025, and is a mandatory reference for registration, technical analysis, validation, and other procedures related to CAR.

The regulation establishes the following official bases:

Hydrography from the Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable Development (“FBDS”);

Land use and cover from the MapBiomas Project, in its latest version available for Tocantins;

Slope map generated from the digital terrain model derived from the SRTM/NASA mission.

References must be used in all geospatial analyses, thematic cross-checks, and validations carried out by NATURATINS, ensuring greater precision, uniformity, and technical reliability in the processes. The ordinance also allows for the incorporation of other geospatial bases upon technical evaluation and specific normative act.

Its implementation does not invalidate previous analyses, but requires that any further analysis and review comply with the references adopted. Processes already concluded using different bases may be reviewed upon specific request. NATURATINS is responsible for the management, updating, maintenance, and institutional availability of the defined bases.

Waste use in agriculture

SANTA CATARINA

Santa Catarina establishes guidelines for waste use in agriculture, forestry, and industrial processes

On November 14, 2025, the State Environmental Council (“CONSEMA”) of Santa Catarina published CONSEMA Resolution No. 290/2025, establishing guidelines and criteria for the use of waste classified as Class I, IIA, or IIB as inputs in agriculture, forestry, industrial or construction processes, as well as procedures for environmental licensing and technical control.

The regulation stipulates that the use of such waste may only occur upon a specific Environmental Authorization (“AuA”) issued by the competent environmental authority, linked to the validity of the project’s operating license.

Activities such as co-processing, thermal treatment of waste, energy recovery in boilers, recycling of uncontaminated materials, and destinations authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture are excluded from the scope of this resolution. The AuA requirement is waived for situations involving reuse by the generator itself or the use of Class IIB waste, provided that other applicable regulations are met.

The resolution defines technical concepts such as waste characterization and classification according to Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (“ABNT”) standards, criteria for environmentally appropriate final disposal, and parameters for toxicity assessment (“FT”). Generators must submit a detailed description of the origin process, technical reports on physicochemical and ecotoxicological characterization, and classification according to NBR No. 10004, with analyses performed exclusively by laboratories accredited by the National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology (“INMETRO”). For Class I waste, an ecotoxicity test with standardized organisms is mandatory, following specific technical procedures.

Recipients must submit a complete project to obtain the AuA, including: Process flowchart; Description of waste incorporation;

Percentage and quantity to be used; Emission and effluent control systems; Functional and environmental assessment of the product; Identification of the technical team responsible, with Technical Responsibility Annotation (“ART”). The regulation sets FT toxicity limits and rules for temporary storage, in compliance with ABNT standards. It also requires that waste transportation comply with the Waste Transport Manifest (“MTR”) provided for in state legislation.

Use of prescribed and controlled burning

RORAIMA

Roraima extends authorization cycle for controlled burning and prescribed fire

On November 07, 2025, the State Foundation for Environment and Water Resources published FEMARH/PRES/DIRAF/DRH Ordinance No. 1,167/2025, extending the 16th authorization cycle for the use of prescribed fire and controlled burning in the state of Roraima.

The ordinance extends the authorization period for burning activities until December 06, 2025, maintaining the provisions established in the Roraima State Plan for Deforestation and Burn Control (“PPCDQ/RR”) and the guidelines of the National Policy for Integrated Fire Management. It also provides that authorized burns may be suspended based on a technical assessment by the State Committee for the Prevention, Control of Burns, and Wildfire Suppression, using monitoring data from the National Institute for Space Research (“INPE”) and alerts issued through the State Wildfire Prevention and Suppression System (“SEPCIF”).

The use of fire in agroforestry‑pastoral areas without authorization, or in violation of the terms of the issued authorization, will be considered illegal burning, subject to a fine of BRL 10,000 per hectare or fraction thereof, in compliance with Decree No. 12,189/2024.

Additionally, the ordinance establishes operational requirements for prescribed burning activities, including:

Prior notification of neighboring landowners;

Advance communication to Civil Defense and the Fire Department;

Maintenance of firebreaks;

Availability of water sources and suppression equipment; and

Execution only during safe burning windows – after the first rains and under low‑wind conditions;

All of which aim to ensure adequate risk mitigation and prevent the spread of wildfires.

Special regularization program

GOIÁS

Goiás extends deadlines for Special Regularization Program and repeals provisions on land subdivision

On November 19, 2025, SEMAD published SEMAD Ordinance No. 585/2025, amending Ordinance No. 753/2024, which established the Special Regularization Program, aiming to extend its validity period and repeal provisions related to land subdivision.

The regulation extends to two years – counted from November 13, 2024 – the period during which unlicensed or unregistered agents responsible for projects or activities may regularize their status, including their eligibility for the discounts offered under the program. This extension applies to activities such as animal confinement, irrigated perennial agriculture, and projects involving dams, provided that corrective registration or licensing is requested within the established period.

In addition to the extension, the regulation repeals item IV of §1 of Article 4, Section IV on “Land Subdivision Activities”, of Chapter III, as well as Article 8 of Ordinance No. 753/2024.

Environmental licensing

FEDERAL

Senate approves creation of Special Environmental License for strategic projects

On December 03, 2025, the Federal Senate approved Provisional Measure No. 1,308/2025, converted into Bill of Conversion No. 11/2025, which creates the Special Environmental License (“LAE”) for projects deemed strategic by the Federal Government.

Bill No. 11/2025 now proceeds to presidential sanction. The LAE will apply to activities or projects defined as strategic by decree, based on the biennial proposal of the Government Council. Among the expressly listed cases are reconstruction and repaving works on existing highways connecting federal units, such as BR-319, which links Porto Velho (in Roraima) to Manaus (in Amazonas). The regulation also allows projects that use environmental resources and cause significant environmental degradation to request the LAE, provided that they comply with the established conditions.

Finally, Bill No. 11/2025 removes the provision for financing technical assistance to affected communities, which was included in the previous version of the text. It also reinforces that the LAE does not eliminate the obligation to comply with environmental and social conditions addressed in the legislation.

Congress overturns vetoes and reinstates provisions of the General Environmental Licensing Law

On November 27, 2025, the Brazilian National Congress overturned 52 executive vetoes of Law No. 15,190/2025 (“General Environmental Licensing Law”), reinstating provisions regarding the waiver and simplification of environmental licensing, entrepreneurs’ responsibilities, and the definition of the competencies of federal, state, and municipal authorities. The Presidency will now promulgate the sections rejected by the Brazilian Parliament.

Among the reinstated provisions are rules allowing the waiver of environmental licensing for specific activities until the universalization targets addressed in Law No. 14,026/2020 are met. The waiver covers activities such as maintenance and improvements of existing highway infrastructure, power and gas pipeline installations, and basic sanitation works.

Provisions simplifying licensing for lower-impact projects were also reinstated, such as small or medium-sized activities with low or medium pollution potential, which may use the Environmental License by Adhesion and Commitment (“LAC”), upon the applicant’s commitment to comply with predefined requirements established by the licensing authority.

Another relevant point is the possibility of issuing the Corrective Operating License (“LOC”) to regularize activities operating without an environmental license, subject to conditions proportional to the identified impacts. The law also reinforces that environmental restrictions imposed on entrepreneurs must have a technical justification and a direct link to the project’s impact.

By overturning the vetoes, the law restores greater autonomy to federative entities to define concepts such as activity size, pollution potential, and typologies subject to licensing. It also allows states and municipalities to establish criteria for applying the LAC. Additionally, the regulation also relaxes the requirement for prior consent from federal agencies for vegetation suppression in the Atlantic Forest, making such consent advisory rather than mandatory if there is a delay in response.

With the vetoes overturned, the General Environmental Licensing Law takes effect with provisions that expand simplification and flexibility in licensing, establishing new parameters for strategic works, rural activities, and infrastructure projects, while maintaining the need for technical studies and conditions proportional to environmental impacts.

MATO GROSSO

Mato Grosso establishes procedures for environmental licensing of energy cogeneration in ethanol plants

On December 02, 2025, the State Environmental Council (“CONSEMA”) of Mato Grosso published CONSEMA Resolution No. 75/2025, establishing the criteria and procedures for the environmental licensing of energy cogeneration activities in facilities dedicated to producing ethanol from sugarcane. The regulation aims to integrate cogeneration licensing into the main industrial activity’s licensing process.

The resolution defines key concepts, such as:

Primary energy – energy available in nature without transformation.

Secondary energy – resulting from the conversion of primary energy, such as electricity or petroleum derivatives.

Energy cogeneration – combined production of thermal and mechanical/electrical energy from a single source, such as sugarcane biomass.

Environmental Control Report (“RCA”) – a simplified document for low-impact projects.

Cogeneration licensing will be carried out in a single process, jointly with the ethanol industry’s licensing, and will be considered an ancillary and complementary activity. Technical documents and studies must be submitted in an integrated manner, ensuring a unified environmental analysis. For expansions, an environmental impact study will not be required, and submission of the RCA will suffice.

The regulation emphasizes that cogeneration must follow the same licensing class and typology assigned to the main facility and provides measures for simplification and efficiency, aligned with the National Environmental Policy and the National Environment Council (“CONAMA”) resolutions.

PARANÁ

Paraná regulates environmental licensing for biodigesters with biogas energy recovery

On November 13, 2025, the Water and Land Institute (“IAT”) published IAT Normative Instruction No. 24/2025, establishing definitions, criteria, guidelines, and procedures for the environmental licensing of biodigesters intended for biogas energy recovery in the state of Paraná.

The regulation applies to the licensing of biodigesters designed for the treatment of industrial, urban, or rural effluents and organic waste, as well as for the energy recovery of biogas generated in existing sanitary landfills. Additionally, the resolution defines essential technical concepts such as anaerobic biodigestion, biogas, biomethane, digestate, and solid waste, and establishes parameters for classifying projects according to size and category.

Among its key provisions, the instruction establishes the types of environmental licensing, which may be:

Three-phase (Preliminary License, Installation License, and Operating License);

Two-phase; and

Single-phase (Simplified Environmental License), in addition to establishing specific procedures for the regularization and expansion of projects. IAT Normative Instruction No. 24/2025 also establishes necessary administrative procedures, such as:

Declaration of Exemption from Environmental Licensing;

Licenses by Adhesion and Commitment;

Simplified Licenses;

Preliminary, Installation, and Operating Licenses;

Environmental and forestry authorizations.

Moreover, the normative instruction establishes standards for liquid effluent discharge, parameters for agricultural use of digestates, requirements for specific projects, safety measures for biodigester operation and biogas handling, rules for waste and effluent transportation, location criteria for project implementation, and guidelines for mitigating environmental impacts.

REGULATION – MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK (MAPA)

Federal Government recognizes certification bodies for agricultural sustainability programs

On November 17, 2025, the Brazilian Federal Official Gazette published MAPA/MF Interministerial Ordinance No. 27, recognizing certification bodies and Participatory Organic Conformity Assessment Bodies (“OPACS”) responsible for three strategic programs of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (‘”MAPA”): Integrated Production (“IP Brazil”); Good Agricultural Practices (“BPA”); and Organic Production.

The regulation implements CMN Resolution No. 5,229/2025, which establishes bonuses for producers adopting sustainable practices, thereby strengthening the governance of certifications used to access rural credit based on environmental criteria.

Key provisions include:

Recognition of certification bodies and OPACS authorized for IP Brazil, BPA, and Organic Production programs, valid until June 30, 2026.

MAPA launches management dashboard for monitoring Plano ABC+

On November 03, 2025, MAPA launched the Management Dashboard of the ABC+ Plan, a tool that consolidates the results of technologies promoted by the Sectoral Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change and Low-Carbon Emission in Agriculture and Livestock (“Plano ABC+”), focusing on transparency and monitoring of national mitigation and adaptation targets.

The dashboard enables national and state-level performance assessment of the ten sustainable technologies (“SPSABC+”) promoted by the plan, including practices such as:

Recovery of degraded pastures;

No-till farming;

Crop-Livestock-Forest Integration Systems (“ILPF”);

Planted forests;

Bioinputs;

Irrigation;

Management of animal production waste;

Intensive finishing systems.

The request for import authorization will be submitted for analysis by MAPA and, if authorized, may be valid for a single import operation or multiple import operations, depending on the associated health and phytosanitary risks and the characteristics of the product.

The initiative results from partnerships between the Secretariat for Rural Development (“SDR/MAPA”) and the Federal Data Processing Service (“SERPRO”) through a Technical Cooperation Agreement (“ACT”), and between the SDR and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (“CNPq”) through a Decentralized Execution Term (“TED”).

Among the key points discussed in the regulation are:

Consolidation of metrics for the ten SPSABC+ technologies, enabling analyses at national and state levels.

Availability of information on databases, methodologies, and glossaries used in building the dashboards.

Integration with the Integrated Information System of the Sectoral Plan (“SINABC”), strengthening the ABC Platform.

Strategic partnerships for technological development and promotion of sustainable practices.

MAPA updates list of quarantine pests present in Brazil

On November 12, 2025, MAPA published SDA/MAPA Ordinance No. 1,443/2025 – through the Secretariat of Agricultural and Livestock Defense –, amending the list of quarantine pests present in Brazil, as established in the Annex to Normative Instruction No. 38/2018.

The regulation adds new occurrence areas for two pests already monitored by MAPA under specific national prevention and control programs:

Rhizoctonia theobromae (Ceratobasidium theobromae) – affecting cassava crops; detected in Almeirim (PA).

Xanthomonas campestris pv. viticola – affecting grapevine crops; detected in the state of Rio Grande do Norte.

Key points:

The newly included areas will follow the rules of national phytosanitary prevention and control programs for the handling of host plants.

For cassava, handling affected material from affected areas to pest-free regions is prohibited to prevent pest spread.

The update reinforces the importance of phytosanitary surveillance and control of host plant handling activities.

Enforcement of these measures lies with state plant protection agencies, with official information available on MAPA’s website.

Decree modernizes oversight of plant-based products and consolidates agricultural regulations

On October 31, 2025, Decree No. 12,709 was published, unifying the regulation of plant-based products under numerous sectoral laws, including Law No. 14,515/2022, which established self-monitoring as the cornerstone of agricultural defense. The regulation represents a significant step forward by consolidating rules and aligning Brazil with international practices.

The decree sets technical standards to ensure compliance of plant-based products, including:

Sensory normality, quality, and quantity of the components;

Absence of harmful substances, contaminants, and deterioration;

Compliance with microbiological and physico-chemical limits;

Adoption of good manufacturing practices and appropriate technological processes; and

Preservation and presentation compatible with safe consumption.

Quality and identity standards will be established in complementary normative acts, and in the absence of such standards, the Codex Alimentarius may be used as a reference.

Traceability and recall

The decree requires all agents in the plant production chain – including producers, distributors, retailers, and importers – to implement traceability mechanisms for each product batch, supported by systematic and auditable records that allow identification of origin and monitoring handling across the entire supply chain. Information must remain available for inspection for 18 months after the product’s expiration date or shipment.

The decree establishes rules for recall procedures, which must be initiated when deficiencies or non-conformities are identified posing risks to consumer, plant, or animal health. In such cases, the responsible party or importer must immediately remove the product from the market at their own expense. This obligation includes halting commercialization, segregating the batch, and implementing the prescribed corrective measures, which may occur at the initiative of the operator, by order of the supervisory authority, or by administrative decision. MAPA will issue risk alerts with information on recalls and actions to be taken by involved parties.

Oversight and Inspecting Authorities

The decree establishes the Brazilian Inspection System for Plant-Based Products (“SISBI-POV”) to ensure identity, quality, and hygienic-sanitary safety of plant products. Implementation will occur under a voluntary adherence regime, with equivalent systems among the Federal Government, states, municipalities, and public consortia. MAPA is responsible for coordinating SISBI-POV and carrying out activities such as adherence audits, establishment and product registration, self-monitoring oversight, import/export certification, compliance program management, and other actions to mitigate agricultural defense risks.

Infractions and Penalties

Applicable penalties include warnings, fines, product condemnations, registration suspensions or cancellations, enrollments or accreditations, and revocations of professional authorizations. Minor infractions corrected prior to an official notice will not be recorded, in compliance with Law No. 14,515/2022. Fines range from BRL 100 to BRL 150,000, with a 10% increase for repeat offenses. Suspension or cancellation penalties may be converted into fines through a Conduct Adjustment Agreement (“TAC”). If it is accepted by MAPA, it will have the effect of an extrajudicial enforceable title.

Penalty assessment will consider the risk associated with the infraction, prior records, and mitigating or aggravating circumstances, ensuring proportionality and effectiveness in holding agents accountable.

Transition rules

The decree took effect on October 31, 2025, with immediate application, except for:

Guidelines for identifying facility and product registration and mandatory labeling descriptions for online product offers, which will take effect 90 days after publication, subject to complementary regulation;

Adjustments to beverage registration information for name changes, which will take effect 730 days after publication.

According to MAPA, omitted cases or questions regarding the new rules and requirements under Decree No. 12,709/2025 will be resolved by the Department of Inspection of Plant-Based Products.

REAL ESTATE REGULATION

Committee simplifies probate for small rural real estate

On November 12, 2025, the Committee on Agriculture, Livestock, Supply, and Rural Development of the House of Representatives approved Bill No. 3,720/2025, introducing significant changes for family farmers and small rural producers.

Among these changes, the bill authorizes that real property belonging to the estate of up to four fiscal modules may be probated directly at a notary’s office, without requiring an attorney, provided all heirs are legally competent and agree on the division.

The waiver of attorney involvement in simple probate proceedings represents a major shift, reducing costs and time to regularize rural real estate, which often remain under irregular ownership due to difficulties in completing probate proceedings. This measure may facilitate the transfer of rural real estate used in numerous operations, preventing disruptions caused by succession issues.

Despite the simplification, it is essential to ensure that the division is carried out with technical rigor, avoiding defects that could lead to nullities or future disputes. The possibility of using the public deed of probate to update records with the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (“INCRA”) and the RFB also contributes to integrating and updating registrations.

The bill is being processed under a conclusive procedure and will be reviewed by the Committee on Constitution, Justice, and Citizenship. To become law, the bill must be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Federal Senate.

Senate discusses ratification of public land registrations in border zones

On November 07, 2025, the Senate Plenary approved Bill No. 4,497/2024, which addresses the ratification of real estate records resulting from alienations and concessions of federal lands in border zones carried out by the states. The text now returns to the House of Representatives for review.

Bill No. 4,497/2024 establishes that the responsibility for registration lies with notary’s offices – under INCRA’s supervision –, which will have five years to certify compliance with the social function of the real estate, as required by the Federal Constitution. The bill amends both the Public Records Law (Law No. 6,015/1973) and Law No. 13,178/2015, which governs land regularization in border zones.

The purpose of the bill is to ensure legal certainty for real estate records in border zones and eliminate requirements deemed unnecessary or impractical, aligning with STF decisions and the guidelines of the National Agrarian Reform Plan and of the National Agricultural Policy.

The proposal eliminates discrepancies among state-level regulations, bringing uniformity to the ratification process and greater predictability for real estate operations and rural credit transactions, ensuring legal certainty for the procedure.

Additionally, the five-year certification period by INCRA reinforces compliance with constitutional standards, potentially impacting unproductive or environmentally-liable real estate.

The measure is expected to unlock investments and regularize large areas, favoring structured operations, leases, and financing.",https://www.demarest.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/recorte-background-of-the-interior-of-a-minimalist-constru-2024-10-18-09-00-46-utc.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 13:56:14.318694

Warnick filed three bills, including topics of wildfire risk models and insurance, carbon alternative jet fuel and workforce education. Dent filed two bills, including one extending wildfire aviation funding and another enhancing regulations on vehicle loads.

Wildfire aviation

Dent, alongside Reps. Larry Springer, D-Snoqualmie; Cindy Ryu, D-Shoreline; and Andrew Engell, R-Colville, filed House Bill 2104 on Dec. 8, 2025. The bill is aimed at enhancing aviation assurance funding in response to wildland fires. This is a permanent extension to a bill that was previously passed by the 2023 legislature and set to expire in 2027.

Dent had previously told the Columbia Basin Herald this was one of his top priorities for the upcoming session.

“The fire departments have found great value in this program,” he said. “I am pushing to make this provision permanent, as it enhances our ability to respond quickly to wildfires, benefiting not only the environment but also the safety and well-being of our citizens.""

Provisions in the bill allow local fire departments to access certified aviation resources for the deployment of fire retardants and water, aimed at containing wildfires before they necessitate larger-scale state and federal interventions.

Dent explained this saves the state money by paying a smaller cost for aviation assistance versus the cost of a fire, which may become larger because it did not receive suppression assistance.

Additionally, the bill mandates the Department of Natural Resources to provide ongoing suppression funding and aviation resources, ensuring local departments maintain the financial capacity needed for effective initial attack strategies against wildfires.

There is no cost analysis available as of Friday. More information on the bill can be found at bit.ly/WAHB2104.

Wildfire risk

Following the theme of wildfires, Warnick, along with Sen. Shelly Short, R-Addy, filed Senate Bill 5928 on Dec. 22, 2025. The bill aims to enhance transparency in property insurance related to wildfire risk in Washington State.

It mandates insurers to disclose several key pieces of information to policyholders when utilizing a wildfire risk score for underwriting or rating purposes, including the property’s current score, factors influencing the score, and options for mitigation.

Additionally, the bill requires insurers to provide this information in writing within set timeframes following applications for coverage or during policy renewals or cancellations. Insurers must also incorporate community-level and property-specific mitigation actions into their risk models, offering discounts for policyholders who undertake such measures.

The bill further stipulates that insurers to submit their risk models to the Insurance Commissioner, ensuring they comply with the outlined regulations while safeguarding sensitive information as trade secrets.

There is no cost analysis available as of Friday. More information on the bill can be found at bit.ly/WASB5928.

Jet fuel

Warnick also pre-filed Senate Bill 5932, which has to do with jet fuel production Dec. 23, 2025. She is the sole sponsor of the bill.

The proposed legislation seeks to promote the development of low-to-zero carbon alternative jet fuel, also known as sustainable aviation fuel.

The bill highlights the necessity for state support to achieve emissions reduction goals outlined in various climate policies, ensuring alternative jet fuel production aligns with Washington's clean energy objectives.

The bill stipulates tax credits will be available for manufacturers and users of alternative jet fuel, contingent upon the establishment of facilities capable of producing at least 20 million gallons annually.

Furthermore, the legislation emphasizes the assignment of carbon intensity attributes based on energy sourcing and mandates that credits can only be claimed following verification by the appropriate state departments, ensuring an organized and accountable approach to promoting sustainable aviation fuel.

There is no cost analysis available as of Friday. More information on the bill can be found at: bit.ly/WASB5932.

Vehicle loads

Following the theme of transportation, Dent, alongside Rep. Adam Bernbaum, D-Olympic Peninsula, and Shelley Kloba, D-Kirkland, pre-filed House Bill 2109 on Dec. 8, 2025. The bill aims to enhance safety on public highways in Washington by establishing stricter regulations for securing vehicle loads.

The bill specifies that no vehicle should operate on public roads unless its load is secured to prevent it from dropping, spilling, or leaking, with specific provisions for covering loose materials such as dirt and gravel.

Violations may lead to criminal repercussions, categorized into different degrees based on the severity of harm or property damage caused by the unsecured load.

Importantly, the bill allows public maintenance vehicles to drop sand or use other substances to maintain traction or road conditions without penalty.

The announcement was made at a news conference at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, featuring Erik Meade, CEO, DHL Forwarding Latin America, and Georgina Sánchez-Baca, Regional Senior Partnership Sales Manager for Mexico, Formula E.

Since Formula E’s inaugural season, DHL has supported the all-electric series across more than 140 races in 33 cities and 24 countries, managing the complex logistics required to move a global championship calendar. “DHL was one of the first brands to believe in this project, not just as an idea, but as something that would change motorsports,” Sánchez-Baca says.

Each Formula E race requires the transport of over 400 metric t of freight, including race cars, high-voltage batteries, broadcast equipment, track infrastructure, tires, and full charging units. “What we do is work with companies that are experts in regulation, and we make sure everything we move by air meets those requirements,” Meade says. “We have internal experts, but we also carry out external evaluations, especially for the handling of batteries and other dangerous goods.”

The 2025-26 season will feature 17 races in 11 cities, making it one of the most active calendars in Formula E history. Organizers say the schedule has been designed to reduce travel distances between venues, lowering emissions associated with transporting cars, batteries, and infrastructure. In addition, the initial shipment of equipment for the season will move from Brazil to Mexico by sea before continuing to Miami by road, a route intended to reduce emissions while improving operational efficiency.

According to Sánchez-Baca, the Mexico City E-Prix draws the largest crowds on the calendar, with more than 40,000 spectators. The Mexico City race carries additional significance this season, as it will mark the 150th race in Formula E history.

Collaboration with DHL on sustainable logistics measures is not new for the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship. In 2024, the series announced it had worked with DHL to reduce the carbon footprint of its global logistics operations by shipping essential equipment to races outside the European Union using two cargo planes instead of three. According to DHL, the change reduced championship-related emissions by about 5,500 metric tons of CO2 across a 16-race calendar.

The improvement was achieved by reducing freight volumes by over 80 metric t and increasing the use of in-market assets, as well as deploying multiple sets of equipment that can be moved by sea or road rather than air. From Season 6 onward, road transport for these assets has relied on renewable biofuels, which have gradually been integrated into the series maritime transport operations. These changes have delivered up to an 80% reduction in emissions compared with conventional fuels used in those sectors. In 2024, the partnership also tested Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through DHL’s GoGreen Plus service.

Julia Palle, Vice President of Sustainability, Formula E, says the freight changes reflect the championship’s broader strategy. “We are proud to take our sustainability credentials and commitment to reducing our overall emissions to the next level,” Palle says. She adds that close collaboration with DHL has contributed directly to the series’ Science Based Targets initiative commitment to cut its overall carbon footprint by 45% by 2030, using Season 5 as a baseline.

Formula E: A Global Leader fo Sustainability Within Sports

In 2024, Formula E became the first sport to commit to the British Standards Institution’s Net Zero Pathway. The championship uses ISO 14064-1 standards to quantify and report greenhouse gas emissions and applies ISO Net Zero Guidelines to support emissions reduction and reporting.

Since its inaugural season, the electric racing series has focused on measuring, reducing, and offsetting its environmental impact as part of its commitment to net zero carbon. As a signatory to the UN Climate Neutral Now initiative, Formula E began by measuring its full carbon footprint using a lifecycle assessment model that covers all race operations and headquarters activities. Annual assessments track greenhouse gas emissions, identify key sources of environmental impact and inform operational improvements.

Following several seasons of detailed measurement, Formula E set formal emissions-reduction targets in 2021 and became the first sport to have its goals validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. The championship committed to cutting absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 60% by 2030 from a Season 5 baseline, and to reducing Scope 3 emissions by 27.5% over the same period. Together, these targets amount to a 45% absolute emissions reduction by 2030, aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5° C. In Season 9, Scope 3 emissions — primarily from freight, travel and car production — accounted for 98% of the championship’s footprint, while Scope 1 emissions represented 1.3% and Scope 2 accounted for 0.7%.

To address remaining emissions, Formula E began offsetting unavoidable emissions in Season 6 by investing in renewable energy projects in race markets. These initiatives support local economic development while contributing to emissions neutrality. In Season 9, Formula E further strengthened its environmental framework by aligning with PAS 2060, becoming the first global sports organization to meet the international specification for demonstrating carbon neutrality.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2026-01/IMG_2943%20%283%29%20%281%29%20%281%29.jpeg?h=c3a6872c&itok=B7PgMLRO,N,,2026-01-06 16:57:48.150674

In Closing The international push for Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a paradoxical story of unprecedented financial commitment colliding head-on with sobering scaling realities.","The conversation around Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is in full swing, where ambition is flying high, but prices are soaring even higher. Global commitment is booming, driven by mandates and massive capital pushes, even as the industry grapples with the cold, hard reality that building gigascale clean fuel plants is, well, hard. This investment focused post confirms that green aviation is now a serious financial play, clocking in £14.7 billion in global private investment, with the USA snagging 46% of that total.

Europe Steps Up the to Plate with a €100 Billion Insurance Policy

The clear leader in terms of policy muscle is Europe, which is deploying huge public funds to de-risk this crucial sector. The European Commission unveiled the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), a strategic roadmap aiming to unlock the estimated €100 billion (about $108 billion) required by 2035 to scale production. This massive investment is a direct response to the binding ReFuelEU Aviation mandate, which requires SAF blending to start at 2% in 2025 and rise dramatically to 70% by 2050.

As a short-term kick-start, the EU expects to mobilize at least €2.9 billion until the end of 2027 through existing programs like InvestEU and the European Hydrogen Bank. Eight EU member states recently launched the eSAF Early Movers Coalition to mobilize at least €500 million ($580 million) specifically for synthetic aviation fuel (eSAF) projects. This coalition aims to introduce novel mechanisms, such as double-sided auctions, to provide the revenue certainty that producers and financiers desperately need to greenlight new factories. Think of this public commitment as a government-backed insurance policy, guaranteeing that high initial costs won’t result in stranded assets.

Meanwhile, across the Channel, the UK is getting serious too, moving to pass the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill to introduce a statutory Revenue Certainty Mechanism. This mechanism guarantees a fixed “strike price” for SAF producers, boosting investor confidence and accelerating Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) to meet the UK’s 2030 target of 10% SAF blending.

American Companies Score Big Deals

While Europe relies on heavy-handed mandates, the US investment scene is driven by corporate ingenuity – and perhaps a touch of regulatory uncertainty. Corporate venture arms, still recovering from COVID-19 and facing tight budgets, are creatively tackling capital-intensive sectors like SAF by “clubbing together” on investments. The Oneworld Alliance airlines, including American and Alaska Airlines, jointly backed a $150 million SAF fund managed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures. This approach pools expertize and protects long-term SAF investments from short-term corporate priority shifts.

In commercial news, logistics giant DHL Group committed to purchasing over 300 million liters of SAF from Phillips 66 over three years, one of the largest such agreements by a US producer. This fuel will come from Phillips 66’s massive Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex in California, a former oil refinery converted to process only waste feedstocks.

On the development front, XCF Global completed initial site work for its second SAF facility, New Rise Reno 2, representing a $300 million planned investment to nearly double its production capacity to 80 million gallons annually. Even international players are flocking to the US, with Korean Air partnering with Samsung E&A to explore SAF production and supply chains, citing the US’s advanced technology and abundant feedstock availability.

LanzaJet’s World First

In a massive technological breakthrough, US-based firm LanzaJet successfully produced commercial SAF from ethanol at its Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia. This achievement marks a world first for alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology operating at a commercial scale. Industry analysts had been warning that SAF made using traditional Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathways was approaching a plateau due to feedstock limitations, making LanzaJet’s alcohol-based solution a sound alternative. The technology can harness widely available ethanol feedstocks, including municipal solid waste and agricultural residues, potentially opening new pathways for waste sources to contribute to the aviation energy mix.

The Price Tag and the Reality Gap

Despite the flood of money and mandates, the SAF industry is facing a reality check regarding scale and cost. The unfortunate truth is that project failures and delays currently outnumber successful completions. By 2024, only 24% of announced global SAF production capacity was realized on time. Over 40% of the announced capacity for 2030 risks delays or cancellations.

This slow scale-up, coupled with surging demand from European mandates, is sending prices through the roof. Neat SAF prices in Europe recently hit a two-year high of nearly $3,000 per metric ton, making it approximately four times the cost of conventional jet fuel. Analysts warn that this volatile, illiquid market is destabilizing and risks eroding confidence among investors and policymakers. It appears there simply aren’t enough used fryers in the world – or, as one expert put it, “There are not enough McDonald’s on the planet to feed 30,000 planes every day” – to meet growing demand through traditional feedstocks alone.

With the supply shortage being so acute, the targets set by airlines are now “beyond the reach of the vast majority,” according to IATA Director General Willie Walsh at the IATA Global Media Day. Never one to mince words, Walsh described the pace of progress toward net zero as “disappointing and worrying,” making the ambition “more and more challenging and more expensive”. The hard numbers bear this out: the growth rate for SAF production is slowing down. While SAF output is expected to hit 1.9 Mt in 2025 (making up 0.6% of consumption), growth is projected to crawl to 2.4 Mt in 2026, reaching only 0.8% of jet fuel consumption.

The core of the problem, according to IATA, is that regulators introduced mandates, particularly in Europe, that have not spurred greater production but have instead led to “price gouging” by fuel suppliers. Rather than increasing supply, suppliers are allegedly abusing their position to introduce “compliance fees,” which are nothing more than costs passed on to airlines to shield themselves from penalties for not meeting the mandated targets.

This behavior, which Walsh called “ripping us off,” resulted in a staggering cost for airlines operating within Europe and the UK in 2025. Of the $2.9 billion premium paid for the limited 1.9 Mt of SAF available, $1.5 billion was incurred solely as these compliance fees. This artificial price hike has made SAF up to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Walsh criticized regulators for introducing a mandate that “has driven this behaviour” and the fuel suppliers for failing to deliver production while protecting their profitability.

Airlines are thus forced to hold onto older aircraft, pushing the average fleet age above 15 years. The result? Expected fuel efficiency gains for the industry have slowed drastically, projected to be only 1.0% in 2026, down from a historical average of 2.0% per year. The sector is currently stuck in a climate Catch-22: unable to access the clean fuel they are mandated to buy, and unable to acquire the cleaner planes they need to reduce consumption.

Tackling Non-CO2 Effects

Finally, aviation is confronting its “other” climate problem: contrails. These thin ice-crystal clouds, formed by aircraft exhaust, are now recognized as capable of generating a warming effect that can exceed the CO₂ emissions of the flight itself.

The UK has launched the QRITOS project, led by Rolls-Royce, British Airways, and Heathrow, to study how SAF deployment can be optimized to address this hidden danger. The crucial insight is that fuel chemistry matters: ultra-clean SAF, particularly that derived from the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process, generates fewer soot particles, drastically reducing warming contrails.

Since SAF remains scarce, the solution is “precision deployment,” targeting the limited supply to specific flights, flight levels, and weather windows where persistent contrails are most likely to form, maximizing the climate benefit of every clean drop. It turns out that to truly clean up the skies, there is a need for fuel that is not just sustainable, but precision-engineered.

In Closing

The international push for Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a paradoxical story of unprecedented financial commitment colliding head-on with sobering scaling realities. Driven by key legislative actions, the European Union has pledged billions toward the required €100 billion ($108 billion) investment by 2035 to meet ambitious mandates, while the UK is establishing a statutory Revenue Certainty Mechanism to de-risk investment in domestic SAF projects. On the technology front, innovation is delivering new pathways, notably LanzaJet’s world-first commercial production of SAF from ethanol using its Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology, a crucial step as traditional feedstock supplies face a potential plateau.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vYxv!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59509289-e100-4967-97d3-91334669804a_1794x1194.png",N,,2026-01-06 12:12:18.878056

The approval – issued with conditions – sets the stage for the next phase of planning and development.

The proposed renewable energy park aims to produce two critical low-carbon fuels for decarbonizing the transportation sector: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable methanol. These fuels will be produced using a fully integrated clean-energy system that brings together over 1 GW of renewable electricity generated from NSF’s planned solar and wind farms in the District of St. Mary’s, local sustainable biomass and water.

“This approval moves us one step closer to delivering the clean-energy solutions needed to reduce emissions from the transportation sector, which accounts for approximately one quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions,” said Andrew Parsons, Project Director for NSF. “We’re excited about the progress and the potential impact this project can have for Nova Scotia and beyond.”

SAF is made from renewable materials and performs just like traditional jet fuel. NSF plans to produce 165,000 tons of SAF annually, and the sustainable fuel is expected to cut carbon dioxide emissions by more than 85% compared to conventional jet fuel.

The project includes the construction of a renewable energy park at the site of Pieridae Energy Ltd.’s formerly proposed Goldboro Liquified Natural Gas Project. Nova Sustainable Fuels purchased the highly sought-after 266-acre development site with extensive existing permits in place in 2024.

Federal leaders also welcomed the progress. “Atlantic Canada offers exceptional conditions for renewable energy development, including strategic access to global markets, abundant resources and strong government support,” said the Honorable Laurel Broten, CEO of Invest in Canada. “Nova Sustainable Fuels’ progress reflects the region’s growing role in advancing clean energy solutions, and we welcome this milestone as Canada continues to provide a safe, stable environment for transformative projects.”

NSF intends to submit a second environmental assessment in 2027 for the renewable power generation components of the project. Construction is expected to commence in 2028 after all required permits have been obtained, and the project is expected to be operational in 2031. “We’re committed to doing this right and will continue to engage with local communities as the project progresses,” said Parsons. “Community feedback and local knowledge are essential, and we want to ensure this project delivers real benefits while respecting the people and environment of the area.”

Amid sweeping global shifts in the aviation industry, the United Arab Emirates has established itself as a standout success story, one that extends beyond the skies to exemplify a holistic model of national development. Anchored in visionary leadership, political and social stability and strategic investment in infrastructure and human capital, the UAE’s aviation achievements are the product of a long-term strategy that has positioned the country as a global hub for connectivity, commerce and economic influence.

The aviation sector has become a cornerstone of the national economy, contributing directly and indirectly to nearly a fifth of GDP, while also driving linked industries such as international trade, tourism, logistics, and supply chains. The UAE has built an integrated ecosystem combining flexible regulation, cutting-edge infrastructure, sound governance, and international partnerships, creating a blueprint for managing a sector as complex and strategically significant as aviation.

The General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) has led these transformations, balancing safety standards with innovation and embracing emerging technologies. In 2025, the UAE reached several milestones that signalled its shift from adapting to global trends to actively shaping the future. Among these, the launch of a national unified platform for drones reflects foresight in regulating the sector, supporting commercial and service use while ensuring public safety and compliance with international standards.

In urban aviation, the country approved the world’s first hybrid vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) pad design for its “air taxi” project in Abu Dhabi, alongside the issuance of the first-ever global regulatory framework for hybrid operations. These initiatives are not merely technical achievements but represent a redefinition of urban mobility, integrating aerial transport into smart, sustainable city systems aligned with environmental and economic priorities.

Environmental sustainability is central to the UAE’s aviation strategy. The nation’s State Action Plan to Reduce Aviation Emissions includes numerous initiatives covering operations, technology and sustainable aviation fuel. Submission of this plan to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) underscores the UAE’s commitment to climate responsibility and active participation in global solutions to environmental challenges.

On the international stage, the UAE has consolidated its influence in global civil aviation institutions, winning repeated ICAO council seats and placing Emirati experts in leadership roles within the organisation. This recognition highlights growing international confidence in UAE expertise and its capacity to shape global aviation standards in security, environmental protection and implementation.

The country has also strengthened its role as a hub for global dialogue on aviation’s future, hosting international events and initiatives that have evolved from national projects into officially-recognised global platforms. The adoption of the Global Sustainable Aviation Marketplace (GSAM) as an annual ICAO event demonstrates the UAE’s ability to translate strategic vision into institutional frameworks guiding the sector toward sustainability and innovation.

Domestic infrastructure performance has been equally remarkable, with UAE airports achieving record passenger numbers, reflecting the resilience of infrastructure, operational efficiency and the country’s appeal as a global travel and business hub. Airports now serve not only as transit points but as economic engines, generating jobs, supporting growth and enhancing national competitiveness.

National carriers continue to act as the sector’s driving force, investing heavily in fleet modernisation and adopting advanced technologies focused on passenger experience. Orders announced by Emirates, Flydubai and Etihad at the Dubai Airshow signify not only quantitative growth but a strategic vision for more efficient, fuel-saving aircraft aligned with sustainability objectives.

These investments underline confidence in the sector’s future and the UAE economy’s ability to grow in a volatile global environment. The nation views aviation as part of a wider developmental ecosystem, integrating infrastructure, political and social stability, economic openness and ongoing human capital development.

Ultimately, the UAE’s aviation journey is a story of leadership that invests in people, builds institutions and plans for the long term. Beyond airports and aircraft, it reflects a resilient, adaptive model capable of generating opportunities and sustaining growth. In a rapidly-changing world, the UAE continues to position itself as a nation that shapes transformations rather than merely follows them, demonstrating how clear vision, stability and human capital investment can turn ambition into lasting achievement.",https://www.middle-east-online.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_image/public/2026-01/2_21.jpg?h=2bc00255&itok=eSckRT-B,N,,2026-01-06 11:57:44.448217

What are the different types of sustainable fuels?

Sustainable fuels include the following:

Conventional biomass-based fuels are produced from organic matter, including food crops. These fuels are typically blended with small amounts of conventional fossil fuels.

Ethanol is a well-known conventional biofuel. First-generation ethanol is made from corn, while second-generation ethanol is produced from residues such as bagasse, a byproduct of sugarcane processing. Ethanol is used primarily in gasoline blends.

Other biofuels include fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), a type of biodiesel derived from either vegetable oils or animal fats. Biomethanol is produced from agricultural residues, woody biomass, or byproducts from pulp mills. And biogas is produced through the anaerobic digestion of waste streams such as manure, food waste, or wastewater.

Drop-in sustainable fuels can be used in existing, conventional internal combustion engines (ICE). These can be produced from either edible or residue biomass sources by using low-carbon hydrogen or by synthesizing sustainable captured carbon and low-carbon hydrogen. Drop-in fuels have already been used as replacements for diesel, jet fuel, and natural gas.

Non-drop-in e-fuels or hydrogen-based fuels are manufactured by using captured carbon and hydrogen from low-carbon electricity sources (such as renewable or nuclear energy). Low-carbon hydrogen produced through electrolysis is also sometimes known as liquid hydrogen or gaseous hydrogen. When hydrogen is combined with acceptable sources of carbon, it can form e-fuels such as e-methanol or e-ammonia.

How can existing petroleum refineries be converted to produce sustainable fuels?

Petroleum refineries around the world are under pressure to ramp up sustainable-fuel production from a range of factors, such as changing market conditions, evolving environmental regulations, and higher costs. In response, leaders in the petroleum industry are looking to convert existing refineries to produce sustainable fuels such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

MIAMI, Jan. 06, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UMeWorld Limited (OTC: UMEWF), a Delaware-incorporated company advancing enzymatic biorefining solutions for renewable fuels and functional nutrition, today announced Strategy 2026, outlining its transition from technology validation to disciplined, industrial-scale commercialization across global energy and wellness markets.

Strategy 2026 prioritizes the scaling of UMeWorld’s Malaysia-based biofuel platform to address the global Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) opportunity, alongside continued expansion of its DAGola™ functional nutrition platform.

Strategy 2026: Global Industrial Execution

B2B Ingredient Strategy

Building on the commercial validation of DAGola™, UMeWorld is expanding its enzymatic processing capabilities into a high-margin B2B ingredient strategy, supplying global food and ingredient manufacturers with clinically validated diacylglycerol (DAG) oils designed to improve lipid metabolism in consumer products.

Capital Markets Readiness

The Company is preparing for a potential uplisting to the NYSE American or Nasdaq, leveraging its Delaware corporate structure and international operating footprint to attract institutional ESG- and energy-transition-focused capital.

Biofuel Platform: Addressing the SAF Feedstock Constraint

UMeWorld’s biofuel strategy targets one of the primary bottlenecks limiting global SAF adoption: the scalable availability of low-carbon, waste-based feedstock.

Malaysia Pilot Facility

Capacity: 10,000-tonne annual nameplate capacity

Feedstock: Locally sourced POME, used cooking oil, and animal fats

Regulatory Alignment: Engineered to meet EU ReFuelEU Aviation carbon-intensity thresholds

As part of its execution strategy, UMeWorld has received a proposal from an experienced international biofuel engineering group to support detailed process design, plant engineering, and project management for the Malaysia facility. The proposed scope includes process integration, equipment specification, construction oversight, and commissioning support, with the objective of accelerating industrial validation while maintaining capital discipline. The engineering group under consideration has prior experience supporting the delivery of waste-based biofuel and renewable diesel facilities at commercial scale.

In parallel, UMeWorld has identified a qualified general contractor with experience in industrial energy and biofuel infrastructure to support construction execution for the Malaysia pilot facility. The Company is currently advancing site selection within Malaysia, evaluating locations based on feedstock availability, logistics access, utilities, permitting considerations, and development timelines. To support local development, permitting, and project execution, the Company plans to establish a wholly owned subsidiary in Malaysia to serve as the operating entity for the biofuel pilot facility.

“The Malaysia facility is the cornerstone of our industrial strategy,” said Michael Lee, Chief Executive Officer of UMeWorld. “By validating our enzymatic process configuration and operating model at industrial scale, we are establishing a replicable blueprint for future SAF deployment while maintaining execution discipline.”

Functional Nutrition: Regional Validation and U.S. Expansion

UMeWorld’s DAGola™ brand serves as the commercial proof-of-concept for the Company’s enzymatic processing platform and its ability to execute localized production and distribution strategies across markets.

APAC Performance: Following a late-December 2025 regional launch, DAGola™ generated approximately USD $132,934 in initial unaudited revenue.

January 2026 Outlook: Based on secured distributor orders, management expects January regional revenue to scale to approximately USD $1.10 million, representing an eight-fold increase over the launch period.

United States Production & Expansion: DAGola™ products for the U.S. market are bottled in California, supporting regulatory compliance, supply-chain resilience, and brand positioning. In addition, localized production and bottling mitigate tariff exposure and cross-border trade friction. The Company intends to pursue similar localized production and bottling strategies in other international markets, where appropriate, to improve logistics efficiency, tariff management, and market responsiveness.

Corporate Governance and Capital Markets Readiness

In October 2025, the Company completed a statutory merger under which UMeWorld Inc., a Delaware corporation, became the surviving legal entity. Operations are conducted through the Delaware entity, supporting the Company’s U.S. reporting framework and global operating strategy.

Because the Company’s shares trade on the OTC Markets, certain corporate actions associated with the merger, including issuer name changes and related matters, remain subject to review and effectiveness by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Until that process is completed, public disclosures continue to reference UMeWorld Limited (OTC: UMEWF) for trading and reporting purposes.

The Company’s operational activities are centered in Miami, Florida, with Asia-Pacific operations being established in Malaysia to support regional management, manufacturing coordination, and future growth initiatives.

Uplisting Preparation

UMeWorld has engaged investment banking advisors to support a potential uplisting to the NYSE American or Nasdaq, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. Management believes such a transition would enhance trading liquidity, broaden institutional participation, and support the Company’s long-term growth strategy.

2026 Outlook

Entering 2026, UMeWorld believes it is positioned with:

Demonstrated commercial revenue traction across international markets

A scalable enzymatic platform spanning functional nutrition and renewable energy

A defined, EU-aligned pathway toward Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) commercialization

A focused U.S. expansion strategy for DAGola™, supported by localized production

Strengthening corporate governance and capital markets infrastructure

“Our focus in 2026 is execution,” Lee added. “We are building credibility through real commercialization and disciplined growth, with the objective of creating durable long-term value for shareholders.”

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
Since forward-looking statements and information address future events and conditions, by their very nature, they involve inherent risks and uncertainties.","Listing Positions Syntholene as the First Publicly Traded Pure-Play Synthetic Fuel (eFuel) Company on any European Exchange

Chicago, Illinois--(Newsfile Corp. - January 6, 2026) - SYNTHOLENE ENERGY CORP (TSXV: ESAF) (""Syntholene"" or the ""Company"") announces that the Company's common shares have been approved for listing and have commenced trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse) under the trading symbol FSE: 3DD0. The Frankfurt co-listing is intended to broaden the Company's European investor audience and increase visibility within one of the world's most important clean energy and synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) markets.

The Frankfurt Stock Exchange is one of the largest and most liquid securities markets in Europe, and serves as a primary access point for European institutional and retail investors. The Company's primary listing remains on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol ESAF.

""Listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is a strategically important step for Syntholene,"" stated Syntholene CEO Dan Sutton. ""Europe is the center of global eSAF and eFuel markets today through its mandated demand, and policies encouraging market growth. Providing European investors with direct access to our shares aligns our capital markets strategy with the strongest structural tailwinds for eSAF. We view this as a natural extension of our TSXV listing and a foundation for long-term engagement with European stakeholders as we drive deployment of production infrastructure within the European Economic Zone.""

Syntholene believes the Frankfurt co-listing supports the Company's presence and investor access in Europe, which is an important market for eSAF. The European Union's ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation mandates rising sustainable aviation fuel blending requirements across all major EU and European Economic Zone airports beginning in 2025 (EASA). These binding requirements, combined with targeted eSAF subsidies of up to €6 per liter (Reuters) for qualifying synthetic fuels, create one of the world's most robust and durable demand frameworks for producers of next-generation eFuels.

eFuel Market

Synthetic aviation fuel is a clean, drop-in-ready jet fuel made from renewable power, green hydrogen, and captured CO₂, offering up to 90% lower lifecycle emissions and helping airlines meet global decarbonization mandates without changing their aircraft engines or retrofitting.

The broader global aviation fuel market size was valued by Fortune Business Insights at USD 391.23 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from USD 431.70 billion in 2024 to USD 819.73 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 8.35% during the forecast period (Fortune Business Insights).

According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global sustainable aviation fuel market is projected to expand from an estimated USD 2.06 billion in 2025 to approximately USD 25.62 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 65.5%.

Within these projections lies the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, the European Union's landmark mandate requiring airlines and fuel suppliers to adopt sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at all major EU and EU Economic Zone airports starting in 2025. The regulation sets binding, rising SAF blending requirements of 2% in 2025, 6% in 2030, 20% in 2035 and up to 70% by 2050, creating one of the world's largest guaranteed markets for clean jet fuel (EASA).

The EU has also paired this demand-side measure with a supply-side subsidy, offering up to 6€ per liter to airlines that purchase eSAF specifically (Reuters). The combination of mandated demand and subsidized supply underscores the EU's seriousness about bolstering the rapid scale-up of eSAF production from producers like Syntholene.

About Syntholene

Syntholene is actively commercializing its novel Hybrid Thermal Production System for low-cost clean fuel synthesis. The target output is ultrapure synthetic jet fuel, manufactured at 70% lower cost than the nearest competing technology today. The company's mission is to deliver the world's first truly high-performance, low-cost, and carbon-neutral synthetic fuel at an industrial scale, unlocking the potential to produce clean synthetic fuel at lower cost than fossil fuels, for the first time.

Syntholene's power-to-liquid strategy harnesses thermal energy to power proprietary integrations of hydrogen production and fuel synthesis. Syntholene has secured 20MW of dedicated energy to support the Company's upcoming demonstration facility and commercial scale-up.

Founded by experienced operators across advanced energy infrastructure, nuclear technology, low-emissions steel refining, process engineering, and capital markets, Syntholene aims to be the first team to deliver a scalable modular production platform for cost-competitive synthetic fuel, thus accelerating the commercialization of carbon-neutral eFuels across global markets.

The 12-month average blend rate, which reflects longer-term trends, also hit a record of 10.48 percent in October.
Expanding availability of E15 appears to be the driving factor in the blend rate increase, according to RFA.
In Iowa, for example, E15 accounted for roughly 25 percent of total gasoline sales in November, virtually doubling since the start of 2025.
“Indeed, EIA’s data clearly show that the average ethanol blend rate actually reversed course and fell when EPA granted SREs en masse in the 2018-19 timeframe and failed to reallocate the lost volume.","Ethanol accounted for 11.06 percent of the nation’s gasoline in October, marking the first time in history that the monthly ethanol “blend rate” has topped 11 percent, according to newly released data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The Renewable Fuels Association said the record-high blend rate reflects the expanding use of E15 and flex fuels like E85, and should put to rest—once and for all—the myth that a so-called “blend wall” prevents ethanol from making up more than 10 percent of the gasoline pool.

The 12-month average blend rate, which reflects longer-term trends, also hit a record of 10.48 percent in October. Expanding availability of E15 appears to be the driving factor in the blend rate increase, according to RFA. In Iowa, for example, E15 accounted for roughly 25 percent of total gasoline sales in November, virtually doubling since the start of 2025. And with E15’s legal approval in California in October, RFA is working with retailers in that state to make the more affordable blend available to Golden State drivers as soon as possible.

“The new data from EIA and the Iowa Department of Revenue provide clear evidence that ethanol is continuing to gain market share in the U.S. fuel market as American drivers increasingly choose lower-cost, cleaner-burning E15 and flex fuels like E85,” said RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper. “The numbers also prove that the fictitious ‘blend wall’ is nothing but an imaginary barrier created by those who oppose American-made renewable fuels produced from American-grown crops.”

Cooper noted that expanding sales of E15 in 2025 were facilitated, in part, by the Trump Administration’s timely issuance of emergency fuel waivers allowing E15 sales to continue throughout the summer months. However, the emergency waivers are a “band-aid fix,” he said. “To truly unleash lower-cost E15 in the marketplace, we need Congress to pass legislation that permanently removes the decades-old regulatory red tape that prevents most retailers from offering E15 to their customers during the busy summer driving season. Passing year-round E15 legislation would not only continue to build on the progress we saw in 2025, but it would also open a badly needed new market opportunity for our nation’s farmers.”

RFA also underscored the importance of quickly finalizing EPA’s proposed 2026-27 renewable volume obligations, which include the highest-ever renewable fuel blending requirements. “The continued expansion of E15 depends, in large part, on EPA’s pending action to finalize robust RFS volumes for 2026-27 and full reallocation of any small refinery exemptions granted for 2023 and later compliance years,” Cooper said. “Indeed, EIA’s data clearly show that the average ethanol blend rate actually reversed course and fell when EPA granted SREs en masse in the 2018-19 timeframe and failed to reallocate the lost volume. Farmers, ethanol producers, and consumers simply can’t afford a repeat of the demand destruction we experienced due to SREs seven years ago.”

Based on EIA’s latest short-term energy outlook, maintaining an average blend rate of 11 percent for a full year would equate to 15 billion gallons of domestic ethanol consumption.",https://ethanolrfa.org/image/691/1000/gas-station-night.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 09:57:19.918549

My expertise is in supply chain analytics, so our efforts cover the full supply chain.
So in terms of availability, where is this agricultural biomass?
The REFRAME project is part of Schmidt Sciences’ Virtual Institute on Feedstocks of the Future (VIFF).","NC State University researchers will use a grant from Schmidt Sciences to develop an AI-enabled, open-source platform that can analyze the potential to convert agricultural leftovers — biomass such as misshapen sweet potatoes or their discarded green tops — into biofuels or other bioproducts, creating new business opportunities.

The four-year project, Resource Engineering Framework for Responsible, Augmented Modeling and Engagement (REFRAME), supports the path to a circular bioeconomy, where biomass is repurposed to create new materials. This approach reduces waste, creates opportunities for entrepreneurs, and provides new sources of income for farmers and agribusinesses.

To find the best ways of converting sweet potatoes and green tops into biofuel, for example, a sustainable aviation fuel company will be able to use the new platform to analyze the current yield in an area and determine where to locate a collection facility or biorefinery. The platform will be designed to assist farmers, processing plants, researchers and policymakers in making decisions.

NC State University’s Daniela Jones will lead the project. She is an assistant professor in the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, joint appointment faculty member with Idaho National Laboratory, and N.C. Plant Sciences Initiative Education and Workforce Development Platform director. REFRAME co-leads are NC State University’s Debjani Sihi from the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, Joe Sagues from the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, and Cranos Williams from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Additional collaborators are from Idaho National Laboratory, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, ICF International and McCarl & Associates.

We asked principal investigator Jones to explain the team’s plan for REFRAME.

How will you approach the REFRAME project?

My expertise is in supply chain analytics, so our efforts cover the full supply chain. So in terms of availability, where is this agricultural biomass? In terms of accessibility, how do we move it from point A to point B? How can we characterize it? What are its qualities? What can it become through conversion? What would be the cost? What would be the impact or the shock from introducing a new product into the market? How would farmers respond? How would biomanufacturing affect land use? These are examples of the questions we want to be able to answer much more rapidly with an AI-enabled platform.

Will you incorporate any existing digital models or tools?

For all of these supply chain components, we have identified some legacy models, models that have been developed for years that are open source and that have been tackling one aspect of the supply chain — for example, agronomic models that analyze availability of biomass. However, these legacy models have always worked in silos. A lot of people have worked very diligently on one model, but strong connections between models don’t currently exist. The pipeline, in waiting for the delivery of one model’s output so that it can go into another as an input, takes months and years.

How will you apply AI to help with these issues?

What we are creating is first a digital backbone, a digital environment where we can store and have the computing capacity to be able to run a model multiple times so that we can create AI surrogates that are much faster. By creating simplified versions of these models that run faster, we have the potential to predict things that were not previously possible with the legacy models. So that’s the gist of it. We will create this pipeline of models and it will become accessible to anyone out there as an AI-enhanced, open-source platform.

The new stretched A350 widebody touched down at 10:41 am local time in Taipei on January 6, 2026, according to Flightradar24. The new jet will bring a greater capacity airframe to the steadily growing STARLUX stable of Airbus jets.

STARLUX & Airbus: Growing Together

STARLUX has proven to be a strong customer of the A350 family, and the airline’s 28-strong fleet exclusively consists of Airbus jetliners. Last year at the Paris Air Show, the airline ordered 10 more A350-1000 variants, adding to an order that also includes A350F cargo models. The Airbus A350 family is steadily growing as the maker attempts to recapture the market segment that has been dominated by the 787 Dreamliner.

Although the composite Boeing jet beat the A350 to market, the latter offers more range and greater capacity than even the largest 787-10 variant. This, combined with the reputational dent that Boeing has suffered in recent years, has helped the European manufacturer gain favor with operators like STARLUX. STARLUX Airlines CEO Glenn Chai made these remarks following the carrier’s additional order of A350-1000s in June 2025:

“Expanding our international fleet with additional A350-1000s is a significant step toward reinforcing our global presence. (...) [It is] the perfect fit for our strategy to optimise long-haul operations while delivering an exceptional passenger experience.”

A First For STARLUX & Taiwan

STARLUX’s rivals in Taiwan, EVA Air and China Airlines, have also ordered the A350-1000 but have yet to receive their first examples. As Air Insight reported, STARLUX was the first to sign on the dotted line for the extra-long A350-1000 at the Farnborough International Airshow in July 2018.

The airline’s competitors did not finalize their first order until 2025, highlighting how early adoption of Airbus's latest and greatest clean sheet airliner is giving STARLUX a leg up today. With the first already on the ramp in Taipei, the airline has a backlog of 17 A350-1000s expected to be delivered in the future.

STARLUX also flies the A350-900, the first of which was received in 2022. The exceptional fuel efficiency and range, paired with the dramatically improved cabin comfort of the A350XWB has been received enthusiastically. In addition to the growing order book of STARLUX Airlines, more operators around the Asia Pacific region have shown strong interest in A350 models, such as Cathay Pacific and others.

The XWB Difference

The A350, also known as the XWB for 'eXtra WideBody,' is the first Airbus jet made from scratch with composite materials in mind as the primary basis for its construction. The aircraft has proven to be exceptionally fuel efficient, low maintenance, reliable, quiet, and, thanks to its very strong fuselage, much more comfortable for passengers. Inside the A350 are upgrades that are both obvious immediately once you step on board, and those that are invisible but make a dramatic difference.

The cabin is pressurized to a lower altitude than legacy aircraft and has a higher humidity level, significantly reducing discomfort in flight and jet lag after landing. Airbus notes that the A350 is already able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel ( SAF) in its effort to greatly reduce emissions, even beyond the 25% lower fuel consumption levels already offered by the jet. Airbus aims to make its aircraft up to 100% SAF capable by 2030.

The A350 family has more than 1,400 orders from 60 customers, with 157 ordered in 2025, and over 650 planes in service with 38 operators today. There were 44 A350s delivered in 2025. The manufacturer's scramble to achieve its 2025 goal of 820 deliveries saw 793 reach customers before the new year. While falling short of the original goal, that number was right on target for the revised tally after supplier issues slowed things down.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tail-livery-of-the-first-starlux-a350-1000.jpg?w=1200&h=675&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-06 08:57:09.951311

The proposal would amend Decree 1073 of 2015 and introduce changes to how locally produced and imported gas is declared and sold.
The ministry said recent developments in the natural gas market have exposed structural weaknesses that require government action.
This has increased Colombia’s reliance on imported gas, exposing the country to international price fluctuations and logistical risks.
Industry body Naturgas said Colombia now has limited flexibility because of falling domestic gas supply, rising imports and delays in major strategic projects.","Biogas and biomethane could help Colombia reduce its dependence on foreign natural gas during periods of supply pressure, according to the Ministry of Mines and Energy, reports Bnamericas.

The ministry said studies carried out by the Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME) show that Colombia has strong potential to produce biogas and biomethane using agricultural waste, livestock residues and organic urban waste.

To make use of this potential, the ministry has issued a draft decree proposing technical rules for bringing these alternative fuels into the energy system. The proposal would amend Decree 1073 of 2015 and introduce changes to how locally produced and imported gas is declared and sold.

The ministry said recent developments in the natural gas market have exposed structural weaknesses that require government action. It said intervention is needed to address market imbalances, protect competition, ensure supply security and safeguard consumers.

According to the ministry, gas producers have been reporting steadily lower production capacity. Current projections suggest output could fall to between 750 and 780 billion British thermal units per day by 2027, compared with earlier estimates of more than 1,000 BBTU per day.

It added that actual gas production has been running 5 to 15 per cent below declared capacity due to maintenance work, operational issues and the natural decline of mature gas fields. This has increased Colombia’s reliance on imported gas, exposing the country to international price fluctuations and logistical risks.

Industry body Naturgas said Colombia now has limited flexibility because of falling domestic gas supply, rising imports and delays in major strategic projects. It said average gas supply over the past five years stood at about 1,074 BBTU per day, but declining local production has meant that between 7 and 19 per cent of gas used in 2024 and 2025 had to be imported. So far this year, imports account for about 20 per cent of total gas consumption.

The Ministry of Mines and Energy has invited public comments on the draft decree, which can be sent by email. The full proposal and supporting documents have been made available for review.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Biogas-7.png,N,,2026-01-06 08:57:17.247137

This proactive commitment has now reached a new milestone: decarbonising our air freight. We are proud to announce a new partnership with DHL Express to reduce 100% of our share of air freight emissions in the DHL transport network.

Starting January 2026, we invest in reducing emissions corresponding to 100% of our B2B and B2C jewellery distribution emissions through DHL GoGreen Plus. As part of DHL’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions, GoGreen Plus is a logistics solution that enables businesses to lower their indirect supply chain (Scope 3) emissions through the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This powerful collaboration cements our shared commitment to sustainability and ensures our deliveries are part of our aim to reduce emissions throughout our supply chain. By integrating SAF, we are offering a tangible, low-carbon solution; marking a major milestone in our ongoing sustainability journey.

THE IMPACT

SAF can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 80%* over its lifecycle compared to conventional jet fuel. In other words, a single air shipment can not be fully climate-neutral in itself. However, the ambitious companies that take part in investing in SAF can reduce up to 100% of their share of air emissions within the logistics network through a book-and-claim system.

THE SCIENCE

Unlike traditional fuel, which releases carbon locked away underground, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a biofuel made from non-fossil, renewable resources. SAF is an alternative liquid fuel, with a drastically lower environmental impact than traditional jet fuel. It utilises certified feedstock such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and agricultural waste.

THE CYCLE

Because the feedstock absorbs carbon during its lifecycle, the carbon released when SAF is burned is largely balanced, significantly reducing carbon emissions compared to traditional jet fuel.

Since beginning our emissions reporting in 2021, we have proactively sought ways to lower our footprint by adopting recyclable materials and altering business practices. Our total emissions for 2024 equated to 324 tCO2e, a 6% emission reduction from the previous year. Transportation and distribution (part of Scope 3 emissions) represented 29,6% of our total emissions during 2024 - presenting our second biggest driver of emissions. With ambitious growth targets going forward, reducing distribution emissions will be crucial to make a difference across our value chain.

In our commitment to drive sustainable change, we strategically invested in SAF to achieve a 30% reduction in emissions for our B2C jewellery distribution in 2024. Building on this progress, we increased the impact to a 50% emission reduction across both B2C and B2B in 2025. This corresponded to reducing half of all jewellery shipment emissions in our logistics chain; from supplier and wholesale shipments to online orders. Starting January 2026, we substantially increase our investment across B2C and B2B, reducing 100% of our share of air emissions across the DHL transport network.

The shift to Sustainable Aviation Fuel not only reduces our carbon footprint over time, but also supports the global transition to cleaner logistics solutions. While there’s a long journey ahead reaching net zero in carbon air freight, SAF remains the closest solution to this goal. This vital step represents a significant transformation, reflecting our belief that responsible business practices require action beyond the industry standard. Our aim is to continuously align our growth with our long-term commitment to environmental responsibility, strengthening our licence to grow.

In 2025, the company advanced several key levers of its sustainability strategy, from scaling sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to electrifying last‑mile delivery and building solar‑powered infrastructure. These achievements mark meaningful progress toward DHL’s goal of net‑zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and reinforce its role in building more sustainable, efficient, and resilient global trade. Here are five milestones that defined this progress.

Advancing sustainable aviation: Largest SAF agreement in the U.S.

Air freight remains the most carbon-intensive mode of transport per ton-kilometer, and DHL has been a pioneer in adopting SAF since 2021. In 2025, DHL signed one of its largest-ever SAF agreements with Phillips 66: over 240,000 metric tons (approximately 314 million liters) of SAF over three years. This will reduce lifecycle emissions by approximately 737,000 metric tons of CO2e – about the same impact as 2,400 one-way flights from Los Angeles to Frankfurt. The fuel, produced in California, will primarily serve DHL’s West Coast operations.

Cutting emissions at sea: Partnership with CMA CGM

Ocean freight moves most global goods, making sustainable marine fuel (SMF) critical for reducing emissions. DHL and CMA CGM partnered to purchase 8,800 metric tons of UCOME second-generation biofuel, enabling an estimated 25,000 metric tons of CO₂e emissions reduction on a well-to-wake basis (covering the full lifecycle of fuel emissions). That is roughly equivalent to powering a large container ship for several days of operation. This collaboration demonstrates a significant step for low-carbon maritime transport.

Hydrogen on the horizon: First pilot in the Middle East

Hydrogen-powered trucks are emerging as a solution for decarbonizing long-haul logistics, providing longer range than electric trucks. DHL has been actively testing hydrogen trucks in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific, and will now introduce them in the Middle East. Last year, DHL signed an MoU with Hyperview in Saudi Arabia to pilot hydrogen-powered trucks. The project aligns with Saudi Vision 2030 and includes a feasibility study for hydrogen infrastructure, reinforcing DHL’s commitment to reduce logistics-related greenhouse gas emissions in emerging markets.

Fully electric delivery across Germany

DHL aims to electrify 66% of its last-mile fleet – the final step of getting a shipment to the end customer – by 2030, with Germany leading the charge. In 2025, the company announced one of its largest electric‑vehicle purchases: 2,400 new Ford electric vans for its Post & Parcel Germany division, the majority of which have already been delivered and are in operation. This milestone means that one-third of all German postcodes will benefit from zero-GHG-emission last-mile delivery, powered by a fleet of more than 35,000 electric vehicles, including e-trikes, e-vans, and e-bikes.

Solar-powered warehousing in Asia

Beyond operational carbon neutrality, DHL is exploring facilities that produce or source renewable energy on-site, combining sustainability with energy self-sufficiency. In Thailand last year, DHL launched a solar-powered warehouse expected to generate 100% of its energy on-site through a 4.2 MWp solar array and advanced battery storage. This facility eliminates reliance on fossil-based grid electricity and sets a blueprint for future logistics infrastructure worldwide.
