EDMOND, OK, UNITED STATES, September 2, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Green Fuels Operating (GFO), a subsidiary of Clean Refineries Inc., and Eden Carbon Solutions Pty Ltd announced today a groundbreaking partnership that will transform how refineries convert carbon dioxide emissions into valuable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The partnership grants GFO exclusive North American rights to Eden's proven carbon capture and synthesis technology, positioning the companies to revolutionize fuel production across the continent.

The partnership combines Clean Refineries’ Net-Zero Emissions Technology (NZET) with Eden's advanced CO₂-to-fuel conversion system, creating a revolutionary approach to sustainable fuel production.

The patented technology Eden utilizes operates through a three-stage process that captures and converts CO₂ into premium transportation fuels. The system uses Hot Potassium Carbonate (HPC) absorption technology—proven in hundreds of industrial installations—to capture over 95% of CO₂ emissions from flue gases at dramatically lower energy costs than traditional methods.

""Our technology captures carbon dioxide and converts it into high-performance fuels using hydrogen and precision-engineered chemical pathways—delivering a scalable, infrastructure-ready solution for deep decarbonization,"" explained Gavin Rodel, CEO of Eden Carbon Solutions. ""We capture CO₂ from any source—whether it’s our partner’s refinery or a nearby cement plant—and combine it with renewable hydrogen to create the building blocks for ultra-clean jet fuel.""

Clean Refineries’ NZET technology provides the ideal foundation for Eden integration. Unlike conventional refineries that boil oil at extreme temperatures over 1,000°F with massive energy requirements, NZET facilities use precision molecular separation in a low-temperature closed-loop, zero-toxic-emission design.

""The NZET system already achieves an unprecedented emission reduction compared to traditional refining,"" stated Derek Williamson, CEO of Green Fuels Operations. ""By integrating Eden's technology, we’re not just eliminating our remaining emissions—we’re becoming carbon sinks that actively remove CO₂ from the atmosphere while producing premium fuels.""

Consider a typical deployment: A 20,000 barrel-per-day NZET refinery integrated with Eden technology could process CO₂ from a nearby coal plant, converting what would be 2.2 million tons of annual emissions into approximately 220 million gallons of feedstock for high-value SAF production.

Market Transformation at Scale

With exclusive rights across Mexico, Canada, and the United States, the partnership addresses a massive market opportunity. North America's industrial sector emits over 6.8 billion tons of CO₂ annually, while airlines desperately seek sustainable fuel supplies to meet regulatory mandates and corporate commitments.

""This partnership doesn’t just solve one problem—it solves three,"" noted Williamson. ""We help heavy industry manage their carbon liabilities, provide airlines with certified sustainable fuel, and create a profitable new business model for refineries. It’s a true win-win-win scenario.""

Immediate Implementation Plans

The first integrated facilities are planned for development within 24 months, with sites under evaluation in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Alberta. Each location has been selected for proximity to both CO₂-intensive industries and aviation fuel markets, ensuring efficient aggregation and distribution.

When Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis was discussing with other aviation leaders her dilemma about what to do about Pittsburgh’s way-too-big-and-outdated airport, Jeff Fegan, former CEO of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, had an idea.

He made the bold suggestion of moving the landside terminal building over to the airside terminal — making it one complex. Why do you need two buildings, connected by a half-mile tram? He illustrated his idea on the back of a restaurant receipt dated April 2, 2015.

“I thought, ‘Oh my gosh, that’s a great idea,’” Cassotis recalled at the time. The scribble evolved into a rough blueprint for the $1.7 billion terminal that is on track to open this fall.

City and regional leaders see the new terminal as a way of reintroducing Pittsburgh to the world — and the city will get that opportunity in a big way next April, when the NFL Draft is expected to draw 700,000 to the Steel City.

“For us, from a travel perspective, the airport is oftentimes the very first impression and the very last impression that a lot of travel consumers have of the destination,” says Jared Bachar, president and CEO of VisitPittsburgh. “Travel is a $6.8 billion sector in Allegheny County alone, supporting 40,000 jobs. So having an airport that is world class, that is cutting edge, is absolutely critical to everything that we’re trying to do to continue to move in a direction of being hyper-competitive as a travel destination across the board.”

The design is quintessentially Pittsburgh. Signs are in black and gold. A pedestrian bridge and tunnel — patterned after the Fort Pitt Tunnel and Bridge — connects landside operations with the airside terminal. The undulating roof mirrors the region’s rolling hills. A larger and more comfortable meet-and-greet area at baggage claim acknowledges the charming habits of Pittsburghers who come inside to pick up their loved ones, friends and colleagues — a practice that Cassotis says is “rare” these days at airports. The restaurant and retail corridor is packed with local brands.

When the current terminal opened in 1992, The New York Times called it the “airport of the future.” It served as a model for other airports around the world. It also was built to be the largest connecting hub for US Airways; it was a place where 80% of travelers simply changed planes.

At its peak in the mid-’90s, the airport served 21 million passengers per year. But in 2004, as US Airways struggled through two bankruptcies, it abruptly canceled its lease for the hub.

That led to the loss of two-thirds of its passengers. And with that action, PIT became an origin-destination airport, meaning travelers flew out of Pittsburgh and returned to Pittsburgh. Now, about 10 million are using the airport each year; only 2% are switching planes.

The new 811,000-square-foot terminal, which broke ground in October 2021, is “right-sizing” and modernizing the airport for Pittsburgh’s future, airport officials say. By eliminating the half-mile tram that links the two terminals, passengers will be able to go from curb to gate in half the time it takes them now. And the airport will save $25 million a year in operating and maintenance costs, says Paul Hoback, chief development officer and executive vice president of the Allegheny County Airport Authority.

“The whole point was to redefine what it means to be an airport, and what it means to its community and to a global industry,” Cassotis told a group of international aviation leaders meeting at the new terminal in May.

The design of the new terminal, developed by Gensler + HDR in association with Luis Vidal + Architects, follows trends across the aviation industry: New terminals or airport spaces are bringing in more natural light and greenery and adding outdoor spaces. They’re creating sustainability, enhancing comfort and wellness and tailoring design, artwork and amenities to the specific city.

In a major preparation for the new terminal, a dress rehearsal of sorts will be held on Sept. 20 in which 2,000-2,500 volunteers will be testing all aspects of the airport. PIT hired Daniel Bryan, an industry consultant who has overseen similar tests at airports around the world, to lead the tests here. When PIT put out the call for volunteers in late June, it expected 3,000 to 4,000 people to respond; instead, 18,000 signed up. Bryan will be helping to select the volunteers who will best represent all types of travelers — families, those with disabilities, those who don’t have smartphones or aren’t technologically savvy, business folks and the leisure traveler.

The airport also has scheduled a Community Open House for the public from noon to 7 p.m. on Oct. 11 for people to explore at their own pace all aspects of the new terminal.

When opening day arrives, the switchover will occur during the few hours in the middle of the night between when the last flights of the previous day depart and arrive, at about 11 p.m,, or later, to when the first flights depart on opening day before dawn. The roads to the new terminal are finished, and new directional signs are up. Just a single strip of Jersey barriers needs to be moved to open up the new roadway to the new terminal.

Cassotis is confident the new terminal will be well-received.

“It’s going to work for the passengers,” she says. “It’s going to work for the people who work here. It’s going to work for the people who pick up and drop off. And it’s going to work for our partners.”

The Design

When PIT officials embarked on the terminal project, they brought in architectural teams with the aim of finding and building collaboration first before considering design.

“We wanted to find a firm that was going to be very collaborative — but also disruptive a little bit, and not avoid conflict because we believe conflict was something that could help elevate the design,” Hoback has said.

They selected a pair of global firms – Gensler + HDR and Luis Vidal + Architects.

The next step was getting them acquainted with the Steel City — to show them what made Pittsburgh Pittsburgh. Bill Flanagan, senior advisor for the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, took them on a bus ride around the city. They looked at the city skyline from Mount Washington; they walked through Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens; they toured the universities; they drove through neighborhoods.

The firms came up with a design theme based on their observations: Nature, Technology, Community — or NaTeCo.

You see nature in the steel columns shaped like trees that stretch to the ceiling in the departure area. You see it in the tall windows and wavy, wood-like ceiling (the panels are actually made of metal to look like wood; developers learned that the wood could warp) that bring in natural light, cutting down on the use of electricity. You see it in the constellation lighting. And you see it in other greenery and the four outside terraces.

Each of the terraces — two before the security checkpoint and two post-security — will be filled with native plants, walkways and benches. Rainwater will be collected and recirculated to water the landscaping, says Chad Willis, the authority’s vice president of planning, environmental and sustainability at PIT.

“The use of nature — natural light, ventilation, color, vegetation, outdoor activity — all those things are very rare in an airport, and this will be one of the very first airports in the world to take advantage of all these possibilities,” architect Luis Vidal said in an airport video.

Another aim of the design is to reduce travel stress. “We’re trying to reduce stressors and stimuli as much as possible,” Siri Betts-Sonstegard, senior vice president of experience and design for the airport authority, said on a recent tour of the new terminal.

“We can’t be a completely quiet airport, but we’re trying to reduce, [for example,] sound coming out of speakers — we put that into our concession agreements … We’re really creating a sense of calm, because we know [that] travel can be difficult.”

PM Managing Editor Sean Collier contributed to this report.

Ticketing & Security

The airline ticket counters are in the main lobby, where passengers enter the airport for departures. Each airline counter will have a lower section accessible to wheelchairs. Improved signage, lighting and design aim to help more quickly guide travelers through this area.

From there, travelers will follow signs or the constellation lighting in the ceiling to the security checkpoint. The distance between the individual lights in the ceiling narrows as they progress toward the checkpoint — serving as a decorative wayfinding tool.

There are 12 public Transportation Security Administration lanes (double the number of what’s in the main security area now), including lanes for TSA PreCheck, CLEAR and Priority boarding. The number of lanes dedicated to each will vary according to demand; there’s also an additional line exclusively for staff and airline employees.

With state-of-the-art scanning equipment, travelers no longer will have to remove phones, tablets, laptops or liquids, Hoback says. And, because of a change recently made by the TSA, they don’t have to remove their shoes, either.

Peak waiting times to get through the new TSA lanes have been estimated to be no more than 30 minutes, he says.

Once through security, passengers will walk 160 feet across a bridge and through a tunnel — which emulates the entrance to Downtown through the Fort Pitt tunnel — to get to the airside terminal, with its shops, restaurants and gates. A wall of video screens on each side of the bridge will present wayfinding information and more. Once passengers get through the tunnel, they’ll take escalators or elevators down to the center core of the airside terminal to the gates.

Checked baggage will be handled on the terminal’s ground floor, where robots will be assisting TSA agents in their inspections of suspicious bags and those that trigger alarms. Currently, the agents have to pick up a suspicious 50-pound bag, take it to another belt, open it, inspect it and then manually return it to another belt.

“We will have 41 robots in this airport that do all of that,” Hoback says. “The TSA agent will never have to lift up that bag, which is certainly a safety issue” and can cause back injuries for the agents. He added that PIT will be one of a handful of airports using robots in this way.

Getting There

Visitors to the new terminal at Pittsburgh International Airport will take the same exit off of Interstate 376 that they do now. They will enter the airport property on a similar horseshoe-shaped roadway as they do now — it will just go deeper into the property. And they’ll use the same exit out of the airport property as they do now.

In fact, passengers may not even notice much change as they use the new airport roadways —- and airport officials say that is by design.

Passengers will be directed by overhead signs to parking options (including a new garage, with more than 3,200 spaces for public parking — tripling the number of covered parking spaces currently at the airport), or to a double-decker bridge on the front of the terminal that will separate traffic into three levels. The top is for departures, like it is now. The middle is for arrivals, dedicating space to passenger pickup. The bottom level will be for all rideshares, taxies, vans and buses.

Gone will be the current confusion at the baggage-claim level, in which passenger pickup is on one side of the building and public transportation, rideshares and taxis are on the other.

Regarding parking, there now is a designated cell-phone lot where drivers can park at no cost while waiting to pick up arriving passengers. It will be near the entrance to the airport property and will be called the Free Wait Lot, where motorists can wait, for free, for up to an hour.

There are 2,800 spaces in the Terminal Lot, a surface lot next to the terminal, plus those in the new Terminal Garage. The garage will offer a “smart parking system” that will assist drivers in finding open spaces on the four floors of public parking. Travelers would walk to the terminal from these two areas. More parking will be available in the airport’s Shuttle lots, currently known as the long-term, extended and economy lots. From here, travelers must take shuttles (with new, bigger buses) to the terminal. The bus shelters will be heated, and buses have been upgraded to better accommodate those with disabilities.

Shopping & Dining

Over the last year, new stores have opened or expanded in the airside terminal. More are yet to come — in a combination of local businesses and national chains.

Many of the 15 new stores and restaurants being added were requested by local travelers and visitors. “We’ve listened to what our travelers wanted — a balance between showcasing not only our local brands, but also having the availability of unique and respected national and international brands,” says Travis McNichols, chief operations officer for the Allegheny County Airport Authority.

“We know many different types of travelers go through our airport every day, and we want to ensure that our offerings meet the needs of everyone that we serve.”

Even before the switch to the new terminal, these new retail and dining options opened their doors.

Hammer Made — A men’s clothing retailer founded in Minneapolis, Hammer Made has about 10 locations in malls and airports around the country. This location, the first in the Pittsburgh area, opened in July in Concourse B.

Duquesne Supply Co. — This Pittsburgh-centric gift shop carries such items as: locally made Tabbara Chocolates, Sarris candies, Pittsburgh Popcorn Co. products, Una Biologicals and Spectrum Fudge; mugs, shot glasses, keychains and more bearing “Pittsburghese” terms including “nebby” and “yinz”; hot sauces, OMG Pretzels and more.

Sambazon Acai Bowls — Found in many airports and universities around the country, this Brazilian-influenced chain offers acai bowls, smoothies and other healthy options.

Champion City Sports — This shop offers Steelers, Penguins and Pirates gear and memorabilia, an interactive sports simulator and all sorts of gifts. It also has collaborations with Build-A-Bear and Vera Bradley franchises.

MAC Cosmetics — A national cosmetic company, MAC also has counters at area Macy’s, Nordstrom and Ulta locations.

Jimmy John’s — A national sandwich-shop chain.

More stores and restaurants are due to open before the new terminal debuts, including the region’s second location of Shake Shack, a fast-casual restaurant based in New York. It is slated to open in the former McDonald’s spot in the center core in September.

Mineo’s Pizza, a Squirrel Hill institution, also will be in the center core. Two locally owned coffee chains are planned: Convive Coffee, which will be opening in Concourse A, and two locations of Wexford-based Cafe Conmigo, in the center core across from Sarris candies (opening in early September) and in the meet-and-greet area. Also in the center core will be Mi Casa Cantina, at the entrance of Concourse B; Bad Egg Breakfast Bar, a breakfast spot found in other airports; and Stack + Press Delicatessen.

The Gates

Seating in most areas has been upgraded to be more comfortable and to include in-seat device chargers. Original artwork also has been added to the gate areas.

Bathrooms along the concourses have been modernized or are undergoing improvements. In particular, stall doors are being changed to open out rather than in — to allow ample space inside for carry-on luggage. Each concourse will include a nursing room, as well as a bathroom with an adult changing table.

Presley’s Place, a 1,500-square-foot room that provides a quiet, peaceful spot for people with sensory sensibilities and their families, will remain near Gate A9. It opened in 2019 after a PIT heavy equipment operator dropped a comment in the CEO suggestion box asking the airport to provide a quiet place for children like his son, Presley, who has autism. The room is now serving as a model for other airports around the world.

Kidsport, a 2,100-square-foot aviation-themed play area for children, is being revamped in collaboration with the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh and will reopen in Concourse C.

Baggage Claim & Meeting Spaces

One of the major changes in the upgraded baggage system involves the distance the checked luggage will now travel from plane to baggage carousel — it’s being reduced from 8 miles to 3, Hoback says. The carousels also are larger.

Does that mean that the bags will be waiting for passengers as soon as they arrive at baggage claim? Not necessarily, Hoback says. Passengers will have a much shorter distance to walk from plane arrival to baggage claim — absent the tram ride — so they’ll get there in less time.

But there will be a circular bar, two outdoor terraces and other amenities at baggage claim to help pass the time. It’s part of the expanded meet-and-greet area, named Welcome Point, which addresses the “Community” part of the NaTeCo theme. Pittsburghers like to park their cars and go inside to wait for loved ones or friends rather than just picking them up at the curb, Hoback says.

“We want a place for families [or] business partners to be able to wait,” Cassotis says, “so they would have access to the landside terraces, free security, great views of the airfield.” She calls the practice of face-to-face meetings “lovely.”

From baggage claim, those seeking rental cars will head to the Customer Service Building out front. They’ll then walk through a covered pedestrian walkway to the parking garage, where the rental cars are parked to be picked up.

Art & Amenities

Pittsburghers will be pleased to see the return of the Alexander Calder mobile called “Pittsburgh,” which is now hanging in the atrium of the departures area. It had hung in the airside terminal since 1992 — and since 1959, at the older airport in Moon.

The piece, designed with paddle-like forms suspended on metal rods that rotate with air currents, won first place in the 1958 Pittsburgh International Exhibition of Contemporary Paintings and Sculpture (now known as the Carnegie International) at the Carnegie Museum of Art. After the exhibition, it was purchased by G. David Thompson, who donated it to Allegheny County; at times it traveled to exhibitions around the world, including to Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain. Calder, who was born outside of Harrisburg, died in 1976 at age 78 in New York City.

Three statues now greet travelers at the entrance of the landside terminal: George Washington, 19th-century investigative journalist and world traveler Nellie Bly and Pittsburgh Steelers legend Franco Harris. Harris definitely will be placed in the new terminal; at press time, officials were trying to figure out places for the other two. Still up in the air is whether there will be places for the replica of the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton (provided by the Carnegie Museum of Natural History) or Miss Pittsburgh, the restored Waco 9 airplane that made the first airmail flight from Pittsburgh to Cleveland.

The Hotel

The 11-story, 338-room Hyatt Regency is the only hotel on airport property, and it has been connected to the landside terminal via a peoplemover since it opened in 2000. It loses that connection once the new terminal opens.

A system of shuttles will run between the hotel and the new terminal. These are being paid for through a settlement reached on June 27 between the Allegheny County Airport Authority and owners of the Hyatt Regency. That settlement includes a payment of $152,000 to Hyatt Regency owners MCSW Penn Hospitality LLC the first year and increases in subsequent years to cover the costs.

Floor Plans

These are the floor plans of the departures and arrivals levels of the new landside terminal.

Future Growth at the Airport

Beyond the new terminal project, Pittsburgh International Airport has its sights on several other innovations.

It’s the first airport in the world to be solely powered by its own 23-megawatt microgrid with an on-site natural gas plant and a solar panel field that is being doubled in size. By 2027, it hopes to have more than 20,000 solar panels stretched over 20 acres of landfill property that can’t be used for any other purpose. When expanded, the solar field will produce 7.7 megawatts of power; 4.3 megawatts of that will supply energy to the regional electric grid, giving the community additional renewable energy.

In June, the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which owns and runs the airport, announced it is partnering with New Jersey-based Avina Synthetic Aviation Fuel to develop the first on-airport sustainable aviation fuel production facility in the nation. Once built, the facility is expected to produce more than 100 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel each year to meet local and regional commercial and cargo needs at PIT and for other entities.

According to Avina’s press release, the plant — which will employ hundreds of full-time workers when it opens — will have a carbon intensity that is at least 65% lower than that of conventional jet fuel. It will use KBR’s PureSAF alcohol-to-jet technology — developed and owned by Swedish Biofuels AB and licensed globally by KBR, which is headquartered in Houston.

Since 2019, the authority also has been developing Neighborhood 91, a 195-acre advanced manufacturing campus on the western end of the airport’s 8,800 acres. The Regional Industrial Development Corp. is handling property management and business attraction for the site.

Among the businesses opening on airport property near Neighborhood 91 (named to represent an extension of Pittsburgh’s 90 neighborhoods) is Mainspring Energy, a Menlo Park, California-based company that plans to produce 1,000 low-emissions linear power generators per year. Its 292,000-square-foot facility — slated to open in 2027 — is expected to employ 600 people.

At press time, airport officials had made no decision about what would happen to the current landside terminal — whether it would be reused for other purposes or torn down.

The airport also sees expansion in its cargo operations; the manufacturing companies at Neighborhood 91, for example, can benefit from their close proximity to cargo operations that can ship their products around the world, says Sara Innamorato, Allegheny County executive.

“They’ve been incredibly creative and innovative,” she says about the authority’s vision. “They have pushed the bounds of what that authority can do, and now it’s time for Allegheny County economic development to bring the right partners around the table to make sure that we can continue to build on that success and build out that campus to really put us on the map.

“There’s a lot of opportunity that is adjacent to the new terminal that is very exciting for the growth of our entire region.”",https://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/content/uploads/2025/09/q/y/tmp-arrivals-constellation-lightingwebp.jpeg,N,,2025-09-02 15:56:21.326272

EDMOND, OK, UNITED STATES, September 2, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Green Fuels Operating (GFO), a subsidiary of Clean Refineries Inc., and Eden Carbon Solutions Pty Ltd announced today a groundbreaking partnership that will transform how refineries convert carbon dioxide emissions into valuable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The partnership grants GFO exclusive North American rights to Eden's proven carbon capture and synthesis technology, positioning the companies to revolutionize fuel production across the continent.

The partnership combines Clean Refineries’ Net-Zero Emissions Technology (NZET) with Eden's advanced CO₂-to-fuel conversion system, creating a revolutionary approach to sustainable fuel production.

The patented technology Eden utilizes operates through a three-stage process that captures and converts CO₂ into premium transportation fuels. The system uses Hot Potassium Carbonate (HPC) absorption technology—proven in hundreds of industrial installations—to capture over 95% of CO₂ emissions from flue gases at dramatically lower energy costs than traditional methods.

""Our technology captures carbon dioxide and converts it into high-performance fuels using hydrogen and precision-engineered chemical pathways—delivering a scalable, infrastructure-ready solution for deep decarbonization,"" explained Gavin Rodel, CEO of Eden Carbon Solutions. ""We capture CO₂ from any source—whether it’s our partner’s refinery or a nearby cement plant—and combine it with renewable hydrogen to create the building blocks for ultra-clean jet fuel.""

Clean Refineries’ NZET technology provides the ideal foundation for Eden integration. Unlike conventional refineries that boil oil at extreme temperatures over 1,000°F with massive energy requirements, NZET facilities use precision molecular separation in a low-temperature closed-loop, zero-toxic-emission design.

""The NZET system already achieves an unprecedented emission reduction compared to traditional refining,"" stated Derek Williamson, CEO of Green Fuels Operations. ""By integrating Eden's technology, we’re not just eliminating our remaining emissions—we’re becoming carbon sinks that actively remove CO₂ from the atmosphere while producing premium fuels.""

Consider a typical deployment: A 20,000 barrel-per-day NZET refinery integrated with Eden technology could process CO₂ from a nearby coal plant, converting what would be 2.2 million tons of annual emissions into approximately 220 million gallons of feedstock for high-value SAF production.

Market Transformation at Scale

With exclusive rights across Mexico, Canada, and the United States, the partnership addresses a massive market opportunity. North America's industrial sector emits over 6.8 billion tons of CO₂ annually, while airlines desperately seek sustainable fuel supplies to meet regulatory mandates and corporate commitments.

""This partnership doesn’t just solve one problem—it solves three,"" noted Williamson. ""We help heavy industry manage their carbon liabilities, provide airlines with certified sustainable fuel, and create a profitable new business model for refineries. It’s a true win-win-win scenario.""

Immediate Implementation Plans

The first integrated facilities are planned for development within 24 months, with sites under evaluation in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Alberta. Each location has been selected for proximity to both CO₂-intensive industries and aviation fuel markets, ensuring efficient aggregation and distribution.

Adapting activities to climate risks Daher also is anticipating the impacts of climate change on its infrastructure.
Julie de Cevins, the Daher Group’s chief sustainability officer, stated: “Daher’s climate policy is a clear response to the climate emergency.","Staying true to its founding values as a committed and responsible family-owned business, Daher is taking a major step forward in its sustainable development strategy by adopting an ambitious and structured climate policy.

This new initiative is designed to accelerate the transition toward a low-carbon future, aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

As a unique player in the aerospace value chain – with activities ranging from aircraft manufacturing to industrial logistics – the Daher Group recognizes its responsibility in driving the sector’s environmental transformation.

This distinctive positioning enables the Group to act on multiple fronts, working directly with its entire ecosystem: customers, suppliers, partners, and employees.

In a context where the aerospace industry faces major challenges related to energy transition, Daher intends to lead by example. With a long-term vision and collective mobilization, the Group places climate action at the center of its priorities – serving both current and future generations.

This climate policy is built on four complementary pillars:

Reducing carbon emissions from operations

Daher is committed to significantly reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, aligned with the 1.5C target set by the Paris Agreement. The goal is clear: a 50 percent reduction in emissions from operations between 2022 and 2032, with the first step of a 23 percent reduction from 2027.

To achieve this, the Group is focusing on energy efficiency: the application of electrification, the adoption of lower-carbon energy sources (such as sustainable aviation fuels/SAF and biofuels), and the optimization of its processes and facilities.

Engaging suppliers in the transition

Recognizing that climate performance also depends on upstream activities, Daher places its suppliers at the core of its strategy. By 2027, the Group will assess the carbon maturity of its 50 highest-emitting suppliers, expanding this analysis to the top 100 by 2032.

Daher will work to ensure reliable CO₂ data for its upstream emissions in the Paris Agreement’s Scope 3 emissions category by collecting data from its most impactful Tier 1 suppliers.

Representative CO₂ data will be integrated into the Group’s management and reporting tools.

The objective is to co-develop emission reduction pathways for the Paris Agreement’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 categories with these partners, aligned with the Agreement’s 1.5C target.

Reducing emissions from products and services

Daher is taking action on three fronts to reduce the carbon footprint of its products and services.

The Group has committed to developing a lower-carbon aircraft by 2027, while also continuously improving the energy efficiency of its airplanes and increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuels in its own flight operations.

The share of SAF blended with conventional kerosene will exceed 10 percent by 2027, reaching 20 percent by 2032. Daher also supports initiatives to authorize SAF blends above 50 percent to accelerate the sector’s transition.

In parallel, Daher is heavily investing in innovation to make its products lighter in weight. At least 50 percent of its research and development budget is dedicated to research in composite materials, with the goal of delivering lighter aerostructures for future aerospace programs. By the end of 2027, eco-design testing and training will be conducted to integrate these principles from the design phase.

Finally, the Group is enhancing the energy efficiency of its services and transportation operations, while promoting the use of biofuels in ground operations.

Research and development investments will continue to optimize tools and transportation methods, with a clear commitment to offering more sustainable services to its customers.

Adapting activities to climate risks

Daher also is anticipating the impacts of climate change on its infrastructure. By the end of 2027, comprehensive physical risk mapping will be conducted for its sites, as well as those deemed critical in its value chain. Based on this assessment, an adaptation plan will be defined by 2032 for the most exposed sites to strengthen their resilience to climate hazards and ensure operational continuity.

Julie de Cevins, the Daher Group’s chief sustainability officer, stated: “Daher’s climate policy is a clear response to the climate emergency. It reflects our commitment to act with methods, ambition, and responsibility. Every employee has a role to play in this collective effort. Progress will be tracked regularly, with annual carbon footprint mapping to ensure transparency, effectiveness and continuous improvement in our actions.”

LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) has announced a significant breakthrough in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, expanding its capability to produce SAF via the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway. This innovation offers a sustainable palm oil substitute, leveraging LanzaTech's versatile technology for decarbonization efforts across various sectors. The development was collaboratively achieved with the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB and the Mibelle Group.

The breakthrough involves a unique dual fermentation technology that transforms waste CO₂ gases into alcohol and further into a palm oil-like fat using non-GMO oil yeasts in a secondary fermentation process. This process addresses the environmental challenges associated with palm oil, such as deforestation and biodiversity loss, by providing a sustainable alternative.

The collaboration between LanzaTech, Fraunhofer IGB, and Mibelle Group marks a significant milestone in the cosmetics industry, as the palm oil substitute replicates essential functional properties needed. The development also introduces a novel route to the HEFA pathway for SAF production, circumventing the sustainability and supply challenges currently present with conventional oil crops and waste oils.

The Environmental Challenge and the Innovative Solution

Palm oil is a critical raw material due to its high yield, long shelf life, and heat resistance. However, the global dependency on palm oil has resulted in extensive deforestation, biodiversity loss, and significant CO₂ emissions, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable alternatives. LanzaTech's technology addresses this challenge by transforming waste CO₂ gases into a palm oil substitute, reducing the environmental impact associated with palm oil production.

Addressing Aviation's Decarbonization Challenge

Alcohol from the LanzaTech process is already an ideal feedstock for SAF production. Via the Alcohol to Jet Process, LanzaTech’s technology enables the production of advanced sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and when the ethanol is made from CO₂ and green hydrogen, e-fuels. The versatility of LanzaTech's technology could potentially now extend into another route to SAF, namely the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway: transforming ethanol into synthetic oils that function as alternatives to conventional HEFA feedstocks.

This innovation advances LanzaTech’s position at the forefront of the rapidly expanding SAF market, offering airlines and fuel producers a new tool in their decarbonization arsenal while demonstrating how circular carbon solutions can transform entire industries.

Also known as liquefied biomethane, bio-LNG is a biofuel made from biogas through a process called anaerobic digestion, which can potentially replace fossil fuel-derived LNG.

BBGI plans to make bio-LNG from wastewater and solid waste from its ethanol production plants in Kanchanaburi and Khon Kaen provinces, said chief executive and president Daechapon Lersuwanaroj.

A process to produce ethanol and methyl ester, two key biofuels used to blend with gasohol and diesel respectively, results in wastewater. The company wants to upcycle the unwanted water, making it an alternative fuel.

“This marks a significant step towards advancing the use of renewable energy from wastewater,” said Mr Daechapon.

BBGI is cooperating on the bio-LNG production project with Singapore-based Keppel, a global asset manager and operator, and CleanEdge Resource, which specialises in industrial wastewater treatment and waste-to-energy plant development.

BBGI initially intended to supply bio-LNG to ships operated by Keppel, but later decided to adjust the plan by providing it for power generation because changing ship fuels is time-consuming, as vessels must replace their engine technology.

LNG, heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil are widely used by ships, but these fuels emit more carbon dioxide than bio-LNG.

According to Mr Daechapon, the bio-LNG factory is scheduled to start operations in 2027 and is designed to have a production capacity of 100 tonnes a day.

Operators of data centres, which require a huge amount of electricity, are also interested in bio-LNG as a renewable source of cleaner energy, he said.

In another development, BBGI on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives for a joint study on the use of algae to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a biofuel for aircraft.

Key to this recovery is Boeing's strategic realignment, including the acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems, a major supplier of 737 MAX fuselages.
Competitive Positioning: Boeing vs. Airbus While Boeing's 737 MAX has gained traction, Airbus's A320neo family remains a formidable competitor.
Certification delays for the 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 variants, now expected in 2026, could disrupt delivery schedules.
Investment Implications For investors, Boeing's 737 MAX order represents more than a short-term win—it signals a sustainable recovery anchored in operational discipline and market demand.","The recent 30-aircraft order for Boeing's 737 MAX from Macquarie AirFinance, the aircraft leasing arm of Australia's Macquarie Group, has reignited discussions about Boeing's operational resilience and its ability to capitalize on long-term demand in commercial aviation. This deal, which expands Macquarie AirFinance's 737 MAX order book to 70 aircraft, underscores a critical shift in market sentiment. For investors, the question is no longer whether Boeing can recover from its post-2019 grounding crisis but how it will sustain its momentum in a competitive landscape dominated by Airbus's A320neo family.

Operational Resilience: A New Benchmark for Boeing

The 737 MAX order reflects renewed confidence in Boeing's production capabilities. Deliveries for the 70-aircraft order are scheduled through 2032, a timeline that aligns with Boeing's stated goal of scaling up production to 52 aircraft per month by 2030. This long-term delivery schedule is a testament to Boeing's ability to stabilize its supply chain and address quality control issues that plagued the program in recent years.

Key to this recovery is Boeing's strategic realignment, including the acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems, a major supplier of 737 MAX fuselages. This move has reduced bottlenecks in critical components and provided greater control over production timelines. Additionally, Boeing's adoption of real-time data analytics for inventory management has mitigated the “bullwhip effect” in its supply chain, ensuring smoother operations.

Financial metrics further support this narrative. Boeing's stock has surged 32.12% year-to-date in 2025, reflecting investor optimism. The company's cash reserves of $23 billion and a 63% reduction in second-quarter losses compared to 2024 signal improved fiscal discipline. Analysts project adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to reach $11.92 by 2029, driven by the 737 MAX's dominance in the single-aisle market.

Long-Term Demand: The 737 MAX as a Fleet Modernization Engine

The 737 MAX's 20% reduction in fuel use and carbon emissions compared to older models positions it as a linchpin for global fleet modernization. Boeing's 2025 Commercial Market Outlook forecasts a need for 33,000 new single-aisle aircraft over the next two decades, with the 737 MAX family expected to capture a significant share.

Macquarie AirFinance's CEO, Eamonn Bane, emphasized the 737 MAX's role in enabling sustainable and cost-effective aviation solutions. This aligns with broader industry trends: airlines and lessors are prioritizing fuel efficiency and environmental compliance, particularly as carbon offset regulations tighten. The 737 MAX's versatility—capable of carrying up to 210 passengers and operating on routes up to 3,500 nautical miles—makes it a strategic asset for both short- and medium-haul operations.

Competitive Positioning: Boeing vs. Airbus

While Boeing's 737 MAX has gained traction, Airbus's A320neo family remains a formidable competitor. In July 2025, the A320neo family recorded only three orders, but its backlog of 7,128 aircraft (as of July 2025) reflects its entrenched market position. The A321neo variant, in particular, has attracted 214 orders in 2025, driven by its extended range and larger capacity.

However, Boeing's recent order momentum—30 737 MAX orders in July 2025, compared to the A320neo's three—suggests a narrowing gap. Airbus's production rate of 38 aircraft per month (matching Boeing's current output) is expected to increase to 75 units by 2027, but supply chain constraints and engine shortages may delay this target. Boeing's focus on incremental production increases (42 units by late 2025, 47 by year-end) appears more aligned with current demand and supplier readiness.

Risks and Opportunities

Despite Boeing's progress, challenges persist. Certification delays for the 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 variants, now expected in 2026, could disrupt delivery schedules. Additionally, labor disputes in Boeing's defense unit and global supply chain volatility remain risks.

Yet, Boeing's strategic partnerships—such as its expansion into the Asia-Pacific market and investments in sustainable aviation fuel—position it to capitalize on long-term trends. The company's collaboration with airlines like United and Delta, which now report improved transparency and delivery predictability, further strengthens its credibility.

Investment Implications

For investors, Boeing's 737 MAX order represents more than a short-term win—it signals a sustainable recovery anchored in operational discipline and market demand. The aircraft's role in fleet modernization, combined with Boeing's financial stability and production scalability, makes it a compelling long-term play.

However, caution is warranted. The 737 MAX's success hinges on maintaining production stability and navigating regulatory hurdles. Investors should monitor Boeing's ability to meet its 52-unit-per-month target by 2030 and its progress in securing certifications for newer variants.

In conclusion, Boeing's strategic turnaround is gaining traction, but its sustainability will depend on its ability to outpace Airbus in innovation and execution. For now, the 737 MAX order from Macquarie AirFinance is a strong indicator that Boeing is not just recovering—it is redefining its competitive edge in the post-pandemic aviation era.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-02 11:57:00.760610

The plan involves creating a multinational company that would tackle a common environmental challenge while helping airlines meet international targets to cut emissions, reports Noticias Ambientales.

Under guidelines from the International Civil Aviation Organization, airlines must begin decarbonizing operations in 2027. Officials see sargassum as a promising raw material for sustainable aviation fuel, part of Mexico’s push toward a circular and low-carbon economy. The initiative is being driven by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Semarnat).

Currently, sustainable aviation fuel costs more than triple the price of conventional jet fuel. To close that gap, the state-owned Airports and Auxiliary Services (ASA) has announced a multimillion-dollar expansion of its Cancun plant, which produces biofuel from waste oil and could eventually process sargassum.

The plan would turn one of the Caribbean’s most troublesome macroalgae into an energy source. Each year, massive quantities of sargassum blanket beaches across the region, harming ecosystems, damaging tourism, and creating health risks.

Experts, however, caution that fuel production alone will not solve the problem. They argue that broader policies are needed, including safer collection methods, more research into the algae’s life cycle, and strategies that balance environmental protection with the well-being of coastal communities.

In Quintana Roo, sargassum has already disrupted marine habitats, killing fish, turtles, and corals by blocking oxygen in the water and releasing toxins as it decomposes. Its buildup also threatens human health, as workers who manually clear beaches face exposure to harmful gases.

Tourism, the state’s economic lifeline, is heavily impacted as hotels and local authorities spend millions each season on beach cleanup. The worsening influx of sargassum, fueled by climate change and ocean pollution, has led to repeated calls for a national emergency declaration to ensure federal resources and coordinated action.

Without structural measures, experts warn, the growing tide of sargassum will continue to place severe pressure on ecosystems and coastal communities.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-5.png,N,,2025-09-02 11:57:47.749623

Seeing the appetite and potential among Taiwan SMEs for green and sustainable finance solutions, CUB has responded with a range of products and strategies that position the bank at the forefront of advancing Asia’s low-carbon future.

In its home market, CUB focuses on the sustainability needs of SMEs, introducing various initiatives to support decarbonization and business transition. To enhance carbon reduction efficiency, CUB partnered with Taiwan’s first legal entity to obtain carbon inventory verification accreditation—the Metal Industries Research & Development Centre—to provide technical support and accelerate the industry’s transition to net-zero.

CUB tailors engagement models based on industry type, company size, carbon emissions and ESG maturity, conducting thematic engagement scenarios to address practical decarbonization needs and strengthen clients’ net-zero capabilities. In December 2024, CUB launched Taiwan’s first “SME Sustainable Finance Partner Project,” offering incentives such as cash flow services, foreign exchange deposit benefits, and preferential lending rates to encourage SMEs to adopt greener practices.

Additionally, CUB pioneered sustainability-linked payroll solutions, motivating corporate employees to participate in green business practices such as energy conservation and carbon reduction, thereby enhancing internal sustainability awareness.

Exporting Taiwan’s Green Finance Know-how to Support Regional Transformation

In overseas markets, CUB focuses on the sustainability needs of project-based and large enterprises, promoting regional low-carbon transition through green loans, sustainability-linked financing, and social responsibility lending.

In Singapore, CUB partnered with leading renewable energy company Apeiron Bioenergy at the end of 2023 to launch its first green trade finance facility. The full loan amount was dedicated to supporting the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), demonstrating CUB’s concrete actions in the clean energy sector.

In Vietnam, CUB structured several green loan initiatives, including green building financing for ICT sector companies, participation in a syndicated loan for VP Bank (with at least 50% of proceeds allocated to green or social projects), and sustainable financing for public water utilities and wind power development—highlighting its impact across diverse industries.

Further reinforcing its commitment to green corporate finance in the region, CUB hosted the “ESG: Challenges and Practices in Sustainable Development” forum on Earth Day 2025 in Vietnam. The event gathered over 80 industry leaders to explore global and local ESG trends and challenges. The forum showcased CUB’s 20-year presence in Vietnam and its role as a key partner in corporate sustainability transformation. During the event, CUB introduced its “Cathay One” one-stop transition finance platform, designed to help enterprises conduct carbon inventories, formulate decarbonization strategies, and access green financing—enhancing their resilience and competitiveness in the face of climate risks.

These achievements build on CUB’s milestone in 2022, when it became the first Taiwanese bank to sign a sustainability-linked loan in the Philippines, underscoring its determination and action in promoting green finance across Southeast Asia.

Leading ESG Disclosure in Asia’s Financial Sector

CUB is the first commercial bank in Asia to participate in CDP’s Corporate Banking Programme, helping corporates systematically assess carbon emissions, climate risk management, decarbonization targets, and governance frameworks to meet growing transparency demands from global investors and supply chains. In 2024, CUB further distinguished itself as the only Asian bank invited to join CDP’s SME Technical Working Group.Through this opportunity, CUB provided insights and advice that helped shaped CDP’s approach to SMEs, including the development of the SME questionnaire.

After the launch of the SME questionnaire in 2024, CUB invited over 150 companies to participate in the programme. Through the joint efforts of participating enterprises, CDP experts, and CUB colleagues, a total of 121 companies completed the questionnaire and received CDP scores—resulting in a response rate of over 80%, significantly higher than the global supply chain average of around 66%. Notably, 110 of these companies were first-time participants.

The draft states: “In 2035, the Commission should examine the possibility of taxation of air navigation and waterborne navigation and propose amendments to this Directive, where appropriate,” and says the extended exemption is intended “to maintain the competitive position of Union companies.”

Negotiators from member states are due to discuss the proposal in Brussels on Friday, with the presidency aiming for a deal in November.

Before the 10-year period ends, only small aircraft with a maximum of 19 seats and boats classified as “private pleasure craft” would face minimum EU taxes, according to the draft. Any agreement on the Energy Taxation Directive requires unanimous approval from all 27 EU countries.

The European Commission’s 2021 proposal sought to align energy taxation with climate goals by phasing out fossil-fuel exemptions and taxing the most polluting fuels at higher minimum rates; Parliament is consultative on tax files while the Council decides by unanimity. The draft also points to implications for companies already navigating other rules.

In aviation, ReFuelEU Aviation requires a 2% share of sustainable aviation fuel in 2025, rising to 6% in 2030 and 20% by 2035; carriers including Lufthansa have introduced environmental surcharges of roughly €1–€72 per ticket depending on route and cabin; IATA has estimated about $1.2 billion in SAF purchases in 2025 to meet mandates.

In shipping, the sector entered the EU Emissions Trading System on 1 January 2024 with surrender obligations phased in at 40% for 2024 emissions payable in 2025, 70% for 2025 and 100% from 2026; carriers including Maersk have implemented ETS-linked surcharges; FuelEU Maritime started in 2025 with a requirement to reduce the greenhouse-gas intensity of marine energy starting at 2% in 2025 and scaling up through 2050.

Shipping, too, is being mulled for continued tax breaks. This would effectively keep both industries exempt from EU-wide excise duties until at least 2035.

“In 2035, the Commission should examine the possibility of taxation of air navigation and waterborne navigation and propose amendments to this Directive, where appropriate,” noted the draft document seen by Reuters.

The draft plan highlights the political challenges of implementing carbon pricing in two of Europe’s most carbon-intensive transport sectors. For their part, airlines argue that any taxation risks doing more harm than good.

The proposal stems from the reform of the Energy Taxation Directive, first tabled in the EU’s Fit for 55 climate package in 2021. That package aimed to remove long-standing exemptions on kerosene used in commercial aviation, phasing in minimum excise duties to align the tax regime with climate targets.

But it requires the unanimous support of all 27 member states, and progress has been slow. Countries with strong tourism industries, shipping sectors, or peripheral geographies have consistently pushed back, warning of economic fallout.

Denmark, which currently holds the EU presidency, is now brokering a compromise that would postpone the introduction of aviation fuel taxes until 2035. Small aircraft and private pleasure boats could be subject to duties sooner.

Europe’s airlines push back against jet fuel tax

Europe’s airlines are unlikely to be satisfied with a ten-year reprieve. They view any fuel tax as a misguided policy altogether. Industry group Airlines for Europe (A4E) has repeatedly opposed the idea of an aviation fuel tax, warning it would fragment the EU’s single aviation market and distort competition.

“Climate policy regulation in the form of sector-specific taxes, levies, or bans is ecologically and economically counterproductive,” A4E Deputy Managing Director Lauren Donceel wrote in a position paper for the industry group in 2023.

“They reduce the aviation industry’s capacity to invest and innovate whilst potentially shifting CO2 emissions to other regions. Carbon pricing is already applied to aviation through the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), and globally through CORSIA. Moreover, many airports in Europe apply differentiating fees for more polluting aircraft.”

The organisation argues that carriers are already paying heavily for carbon through the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which by 2030 will cost airlines over €10 billion annually.

Instead, A4E points to European airlines’ direct investment in decarbonisation. Its members plan to spend €14.8 billion on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and €165 billion on new aircraft by the end of this decade.

Deloitte study: SAF mandates could widen cost gap

The adoption of SAF by airlines comes with its own complications, including limited production and high costs, which also raise concerns.

A4E recently commissioned a study by Deloitte, which examined the economic effects of the ReFuelEU SAF mandate—requiring airlines to blend 2% SAF in 2025, rising to 6% by 2030.

The report, “Creating a Level Playing Field for Decarbonisation in Aviation,” warned that without measures to level the playing field, EU carriers could face a 15% cost disadvantage on key EU–Asia routes compared with competitors flying through non-EU hubs, such as Istanbul or Dubai.

Deloitte’s modelling suggested that as much as 26% of the expected emissions reductions from ReFuelEU could be offset by so-called “carbon leakage,” with passengers choosing itineraries that avoid EU carriers or hubs to escape SAF-related costs.

To address this, the consultancy proposed a SAF Border Adjustment Mechanism (SAF-BAM), mirroring the EU’s broader carbon border levy. Such a system would ensure connecting flights through non-EU airports carry the same SAF-related cost burden, eliminating leakage while restoring competitiveness “without raising consumer prices overall.”

Airlines cry out as environmentalists cry foul

While airlines warn of competitiveness risks, green groups argue that fuel tax exemptions are environmentally harmful subsidies. With aviation emissions projected to rise in the coming decade, campaigners say delaying taxation until 2035 undermines the EU’s net-zero target.

The debate highlights a central dilemma: how to decarbonise aviation without pricing Europe’s carriers out of global markets.

A decision on the tax holiday proposal is expected by November 2025. For now, Europe’s aviation sector remains caught between mounting decarbonisation costs, political pressures, and the need to stay competitive in a global industry where policies differ by region.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Finnair-partners-with-Neste-to-refuel-with-SAF-at-Helsinki.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 06:56:17.202194

Green Hydrogen Solutions (GHS), through its project company GHS Green Hydrogen ELIDZ, is seeking input from leading equipment suppliers for the project.
Electrolysers (10 MW) powered by renewable-energy sources will be used to split desalinated water into green hydrogen and oxygen.","JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Project development funding for the Prieska Power Reserve Project is being partly sourced from the German Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW), South Africa’s State-owned Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), which has also approved development funding to the project, has outlined in an advertisement.

The green-hydrogen-linked Prieska project, which is located outside Prieska in the Northern Cape, aims to produce 80 000 t of green ammonia a year. It is owned by Mahlako, a women-owned empowerment consortium, and Cenec, a Bloemfontein-based emission energy company that designs and manages solar and wind energy plants. Initiated by Mahlako and Cenec, the project is on privately owned farms of about 1 900 ha, which are sites earmarked for renewable-energy generation.

While these generation sites are located outside Prieska, a town on the south bank of the Orange river, the green ammonia chemical processing will be located within the industrial area in Prieska, on land owned by the Siyathemba local municipality.

The 14 500 t/y green hydrogen content will be produced by a 120 MW electrolyser, and renewable-energy sources, made up of 180 MWp of solar PV and 136 MWp of wind power, will power the electrolyser. The project includes a 45 MW battery storage system to ensure continuous 24-hour operation.

Mining Weekly can report that although green hydrogen generation and platinum group metals (PGMs) generally go hand-in-hand and although South Africa hosts most of the world’s PGMs, no explicit reference is made by the IDC to the use of PGM-based proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers and fuel cells.

Interestingly, PEM’s global recognition has just been emphasised in a World Platinum Investment Council LinkedIn note, which points out that the US-based clean energy technology firm Ohmium International has opted for PEM, with this observation from Ohmium CEO Markus Tacke: “Our latest Lotus Mark 3 PEM electrolyser system is transforming the economics of green hydrogen production.”

In addition. Plug Power president and CEO Andy Marsh has pointed out to Engineering News & Mining Weekly in a Zoom interview that PEM technology is at the heart of everything that Plug Power, a US Nasdaq-listed company, does. Plug Power has been a prime mover in the US’s platinum catalysed green hydrogen and fuel cell economy and Marsh points out that the adoption by US business of this planet-friendly way of doing things is because it pays to do so.

Plug Power built and operates the US’s largest liquid green hydrogen plant, a 15-t-a-day liquid hydrogen plant that uses 40 MW of Plug’s platinum- and iridium-catalysed electrolysers.

Plug Power is involved with more than 80 000 forklift trucks being powered by the 250 hydrogen fuelling stations it has built. Between Walmart and Amazon, there are about 150 sites that use Plug Power’s PEM technology to operate around the clock and with the help of Plug Power’s technology, these companies talk about moving 8% to 10% more pallets an hour, while also being users of clean energy that mitigates against climate change.

PEM electrolysers generate the green hydrogen by splitting water, including sea water, into hydrogen and oxygen.

Then fuel cells, which are also catalysed by PGMs, convert the green hydrogen into green electricity for mobility or stationary uses.

Moreover, the flexibility provided by liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) technology, which is being developed by the South Africa-linked German company Hydrogeneous, provides the oily skin for green hydrogen to be transported, stored and traded in the same way as oil and gas is currently. Very fortuitously, LOHC ensures that green hydrogen can be transported and stored using existing liquid fuel infrastructure, including ships, tanks and trucks. By offering a versatile and adaptable solution for hydrogen transport and storage, LOHC is said to unlock the full potential of hydrogen as a clean and sustainable energy source.

“Africa's green hydrogen journey has just begun. By fostering collaboration between government entities, universities, and the private sector, we can unlock the immense potential of this clean energy source. Imagine a future where African ports become green hydrogen hubs, powering ships and industries with clean fuel. It's an achievable dream, but only through collaborative action,” Engineering Centre of Excellence head Tauqeer Ahmed has pointed out.

SOLAR POWER

Not that long ago, solar power was regarded as too expensive to implement, despite Africa’s abundance of sunshine, but now cheap solar is powering the energy boom of the entire continent of Africa, with major renewables growth in South Africa.

As with solar in the past, in some circles green hydrogen is still seen as needing to come steeply down the cost curve.

In this regard, it can be pointed out that effort, not unlike that applied to solar, is under way in places that include the province of Hunan, a home of green revolution, as well as elsewhere in China.

A direct South African link with Hunan is through the company SANY, which provides heavy industry equipment including from its considerable South African base. This base is clearly visible to motorists on the way to Gauteng’s East Rand.

It can be pointed out that Hunan is also the place where electrified vehicle mobility as well as green railway transport is being advanced.

PRIESKA FUNDING

Regarding the Prieska project, it can be pointed out that part funder KfW, which was formed in 1948 after the Second World War, is committed to improving economic, social and environmental living conditions across the globe while the IDC, established in 1940 through an Act of Parliament, is fully owned by the government of South Africa.

This project, the IDC reports, plans to take advantage of South Africa's competitive advantage in the renewable-energy market and use South Africa’s abundant solar and wind resources to produce green hydrogen and ammonia.

By doing so, the IDC adds that it will contribute “substantially to local and national socioeconomic development objectives” and create 400 jobs on reaching commercial stage.

Green hydrogen is an energy carrier that is produced using renewable electricity and water in an electrolyser.

Market applications for green hydrogen include the production of green chemicals such as green ammonia, mobility solutions, sustainable aviation fuel, marine bunker fuel and the decarbonisation of 'hard to abate' sectors of the economy. Examples of these sectors are green steel production, cement manufacturing and petrochemical production.

In developed markets, the green hydrogen economy has created significant job opportunities – a development that South Africa aims to replicate, the IDC points out in the advertisement that does not reveal the extent or terms of the funding being provided by itself and KfW.

In addition to the Prieska project, green hydrogen- and green ammonia-related projects include the the Hive green ammonia export project at Nelson Mandela Bay in the Eastern Cape, Keren Energy green development near Vanrhynsdorp, in the Western Cape, and a related fuel cell and electrolyser component manufacturing facility project in Gauteng is Isondo Precious Metals.

Keren Energy CEO George van Rensburg has reported that the front-end engineering design (FEED) study and bankable financial model for the project have been completed, with most of the permits for the project in place. The project site has also been secured through a long-term lease.

The Keren project team aims to reach financial close by the end of this year, with production anticipated to start in the first half of 2028.

The total investment required for the project’s full development is around R1-billion.

In the first phase of production, Keren Energy aims to produce about 800 t of green hydrogen a year.

REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS

Earlier this year, a request for proposal (RFP) process was launched to inform the FEED study for a fully integrated green hydrogen project at the East London Industrial Development Zone (ELIDZ), in the Eastern Cape.

Green Hydrogen Solutions (GHS), through its project company GHS Green Hydrogen ELIDZ, is seeking input from leading equipment suppliers for the project. Distinguished by its closed-loop system design, the project will use desalinated seawater to produce high-purity green hydrogen for industrial and commercial customers.

Conclusion India’s sustainable aviation fuel journey is no longer a distant ambition.","The aviation industry is entering a decisive decade in its journey toward decarbonisation. India, with its vast agricultural resources and growing energy innovation, is taking significant steps to align with global sustainability frameworks. A recent collaboration between the Indian Sugar and Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) and the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) signals a pivotal shift.

This partnership is focused on developing capacity across sugarcane-producing states to support the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). By embedding internationally recognised certification standards, India is preparing its supply chains to meet the environmental and traceability demands of modern aviation.

Why Sugarcane Matters for SAF

Sugarcane has long been central to India’s rural economy. Now it is also emerging as a key contributor to cleaner skies. Ethanol derived from sugarcane can be upgraded into SAF, reducing reliance on fossil-based jet fuel.

By focusing on Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, the country’s top sugarcane producers, the initiative aims to connect local agricultural strengths with global aviation’s urgent need for low-carbon fuels. This approach also offers new opportunities for rural communities to participate in the bioeconomy.

Building Capacity with Certification

At the heart of this initiative is the RSB ICAO CORSIA Certification. This globally respected framework ensures that SAF is not only produced but also sourced and tracked responsibly across the supply chain.

The certification guarantees three crucial outcomes:

Responsible feedstock sourcing to avoid environmental harm

Full supply chain traceability to build trust in the fuel’s origins

Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that aligns with international aviation goals

By adopting these standards, India is laying the foundation for a credible and future-ready SAF ecosystem.

Empowering Farmers and Local Enterprises

Beyond technical compliance, the collaboration places strong emphasis on education and outreach. Workshops tailored to regional contexts will train farmers, mill workers, and small enterprises.

This knowledge-sharing effort is especially valuable for smallholder farmers, who often face challenges in adopting new technologies. With the right tools and training, they can become active contributors to a greener aviation future.

Such empowerment also strengthens rural livelihoods, ensuring that sustainability does not come at the expense of equity.

Grassroots Leadership for a Global Goal

The success of this programme rests not only on technology but also on the people who drive it. By building grassroots leadership within sugarcane supply chains, the initiative ensures that SAF adoption is deeply rooted in local realities.

This creates a model where sustainability, economic inclusion, and technological advancement move together. India’s sugar-based bioenergy sector thus becomes more than just a producer of fuel—it evolves into a driver of social progress.

India’s Role in the Global SAF Landscape

India has already established itself as a founding member of the Global Biofuels Alliance, showing its commitment to leadership in sustainable energy. The new partnership between ISMA and RSB strengthens this position by creating practical pathways for SAF development.

With abundant feedstock potential, strong policy direction, and international cooperation, India is well-positioned to influence the global aviation industry’s transition to low-carbon fuels.

A Balanced Approach to Energy Transition

The SAF Horizon project, supported by Boeing, reflects a holistic vision. It recognises that environmental responsibility must go hand in hand with economic resilience. By balancing sustainability with social equity, the initiative sets a precedent for what a just energy transition should look like.

This balance also mirrors the broader goals of sustainability consultancies worldwide, ensuring that every technological leap is matched with responsibility toward people and the planet.

Conclusion

India’s sustainable aviation fuel journey is no longer a distant ambition. With the ISMA–RSB partnership, the country is creating a framework where sugarcane producers, local enterprises, and global aviation stakeholders collaborate toward a shared goal.

The project illustrates how local agricultural strengths can be harnessed to solve global challenges. It also shows that sustainability is not only about reducing emissions but about creating inclusive opportunities and building resilient systems.

As India continues to invest in SAF capacity-building, it is shaping a future where cleaner skies, stronger rural communities, and international cooperation come together seamlessly.

“Jamnagar will be the cradle of both the world’s largest Conventional Energy complex and the world’s largest New Energy complex,” Mukesh Ambani said, calling it the face of “New Reliance and New India.” News source: CNBC TV18","Reliance Industries has announced rapid progress on the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex in Jamnagar, a facility billed as four times larger than Tesla’s Gigafactory. The announcement was made during the company’s 48th Annual General Meeting.

Executive Director Anant Ambani described the New Energy business as Reliance’s “most ambitious and transformational mission of this decade,” emphasising that it had moved from “ambition to execution.” Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani added that the venture would “set global benchmarks” and become a major growth engine for the group.

The giga complex is being built at record pace, involving over 5 million manhours of engineering, 44 million square feet of construction area, 7 lakh tonnes of steel—equivalent to 100 Eiffel Towers—and 1 lakh km of cable, enough to reach the moon and back.

Reliance aims to create the world’s most integrated New Energy ecosystem, covering solar modules, battery storage, and hydrogen production. It has already produced its first 200 MW of HJT solar modules, delivering higher efficiency and durability. The solar platform will scale up to 20 GWp, positioning it as the world’s largest single-site facility.

A battery giga factory, starting in 2026, will scale from 40 GWh to 100 GWh annually, while an electrolyser giga factory will expand to 3 GW capacity for green hydrogen production. Reliance also plans to develop one of the world’s largest single-site solar projects in Kutch, spread over 5,50,000 acres, capable of meeting 10 per cent of India’s electricity demand within a decade.

By 2032, the company targets production of 3 MMTPA of green hydrogen equivalent, along with green ammonia, e-methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel for domestic use and exports.

“Jamnagar will be the cradle of both the world’s largest Conventional Energy complex and the world’s largest New Energy complex,” Mukesh Ambani said, calling it the face of “New Reliance and New India.”

Reliance Industries Ltd is accelerating its pivot away from fossil fuels with a sweeping clean energy strategy. The company plans to launch a mega battery manufacturing plant by 2026, build a solar power project larger than Singapore, and achieve 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen capacity by 2032.

Making his first appearance at Reliance’s Annual General Meeting, Anant Ambani — the youngest son of chairman Mukesh Ambani and executive director of the company — outlined a vision to create the world’s most integrated new energy ecosystem, spanning “from sand to electrons to green molecules.”

Fully Integrated Green Energy Platform

Reliance is investing in every link of the clean energy chain:

Solar modules to generate electricity from sunlight.

Advanced batteries to store renewable power.

Electrolysers to produce green hydrogen by splitting water molecules.

Giga factories to manufacture hydrogen and its derivatives, including green ammonia, green methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

Biofuels derived from organic waste.

According to Anant Ambani, these facilities will enable round-the-clock renewable energy supply and support both domestic use and exports of clean fuels.

The centrepiece of this transformation is the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex in Jamnagar, already home to Reliance’s massive oil refining operations. Once complete, it will be the world’s largest integrated clean energy hub, producing solar modules, batteries, and hydrogen derivatives at unparalleled scale.

Reliance has already started scaling its solar PV manufacturing line at Jamnagar to 20 GWp capacity, which would make it the largest single-site solar facility in the world. The company has rolled out its first 200 MW of high-efficiency HJT modules, which offer higher energy yields and lower degradation compared to conventional panels.

In parallel, construction of battery and electrolyser giga factories is underway. The battery plant, set to start production in 2026, will begin with 40 GWh annual capacity and eventually expand to 100 GWh. The electrolyser facility, also targeted for 2026, will scale up to 3 GW per year and enable globally competitive hydrogen production.

Mega projects in Gujarat

Reliance’s clean energy ambitions are concentrated in Gujarat. In Kutch, the company is developing one of the world’s largest single-site solar projects, covering 550,000 acres — nearly three times Singapore’s land area. At peak installation, Reliance expects to deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers per day. Within a decade, this single project could meet nearly 10% of India’s electricity demand.

The Jamnagar and Kandla ports will provide the critical infrastructure backbone, enabling Reliance to export green ammonia, e-methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. By 2032, the group aims to produce the equivalent of 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually, establishing India as a hub for affordable clean fuels.

Beyond solar and hydrogen, Reliance is scaling its compressed biogas (CBG) operations. The company has set an ambitious target of over 500 CBG plants by 2030, with a combined capacity of 0.5 million tonnes per year. At its Bioenergy Technology and R&D Centre in Jamnagar, Reliance is developing next-generation enzymes, microbial solutions, and high-yield crops to enhance biogas productivity.

Anant Ambani also highlighted the company’s agrivoltaics model, which integrates solar and biogas production on the same land. By capturing carbon dioxide from CBG plants, these hubs will become centers for producing green chemicals. The approach, he noted, delivers a “triple value” — generating renewable gas, electricity, and boosting rural incomes for farmers.

The move would postpone taxation until 2035 and extend the long-standing tax breaks enjoyed by these sectors.
The overhaul is part of the stalled revision of the Energy Taxation Directive, first adopted in 2003 to set EU-wide minimum excise rates.

The move would postpone taxation until 2035 and extend the long-standing tax breaks enjoyed by these sectors.

The draft, prepared under Denmark’s rotating EU presidency, would only impose minimum taxation before 2035 on small aircraft with up to 19 seats and on private pleasure boats. Larger airlines and shipping companies would remain exempt during the decade-long transition. Negotiators are scheduled to debate the text in Brussels on Friday, with the presidency aiming for a deal by November.

The overhaul is part of the stalled revision of the Energy Taxation Directive, first adopted in 2003 to set EU-wide minimum excise rates. The European Commission’s Green Deal proposal in 2021 sought to phase in fuel taxation across transport sectors, but repeated pushback from governments has delayed progress.

Industry groups have mounted intensive lobbying campaigns. Airlines argue that without tax relief, uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will remain minimal because it currently costs two to five times more than conventional kerosene. Shipping operators make a similar case for renewable marine fuels, citing both high production costs and supply bottlenecks, according to Euractiv.

The Commission’s own assessments note that ending exemptions could generate billions in revenue while providing incentives for cleaner fuels. Still, countries heavily dependent on tourism and maritime trade remain cautious, warning that higher transport costs could weaken growth.

Because EU tax policy requires unanimous approval, any one member state could block the draft. Diplomats involved in the talks told Reuters that northern states are more inclined to support taxation, while southern tourism economies remain strongly resistant.

Meanwhile, Frontier Airlines ULCC plans to add 20 new routes to its schedule from late fall, aiming to strengthen its position in the ultra-low-cost segment.

Alaska Air Group ALK, the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, meanwhile, signed an environment-friendly deal with Cosmo Oil Marketing. An expansion-related update was also available from Southwest Airlines LUV over the past week.

Recap of the Most Recent Important Stories

1. At Allegiant Travel, the July scheduled traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) rose 10.3% from the July 2024 levels. Capacity (measured in available seat miles) for scheduled service rose 11.5% year over year. Although traffic improved on a year-over-year basis, it failed to outpace capacity expansion. As a result, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) in July 2025 declined to 86.6% from 87.5% a year ago.

For the total system (including scheduled service and fixed-fee contracts), Allegiant carried 10.1% more passengers in July 2025 than in the same period of the previous year. System-wide capacity improved 10.8% in July 2025 on a year-over-year basis.

2. Expanding Boston’s gateway to Europe, Delta announced that it will start new nonstop service from Boston to Madrid and Nice. While flights on the Boston-Madrid route will start operating from May 16, 2026, those connecting Boston and Nice will take to the skies from May 17. While the Boston-Madrid flights will operate daily, the ones on the Boston-Nice route will operate three times a week.

DAL will utilize its Airbus A330-900neo jets to operate on both routes. Following the addition of the new routes, Delta will serve 12 European destinations from Boston. DAL has been constantly looking to expand its presence in Boston, having nearly tripled its service in Boston in a span of two decades. Apart from the introduction of the new routes, DAL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has also decided to expand its service on the Barcelona-Boston and Milan-Boston routes next year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

3. Following the sales agreement between Alaska Air and Cosmo Oil Marketing, Hawaiian Airlines intends to incorporate sustainable aviation fuel on flights between Osaka, Japan and Honolulu, Hawaii. Fuel deliveries at Kansai International Airport will mark the first time Hawaiian Airlines has introduced SAF. The use of SAF has the potential to reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. Apart from highlighting ALK’s environment-friendly approach, the move is also aimed at strengthening tourism between Japan and Hawaii. Additional traffic on this tourist-friendly route is likely to buoy ALK’s top line.

4. Southwest Airlines has extended its flight schedule through June 3, 2026. The extended schedule includes more routes to new places. As part of the expansion, Southwest Airlines will operate flights to the island of St. Maarten, beginning April 7, 2026. The addition of St. Maarten marks LUV’s first new international destination since 2021. St. Maarten comprises two parts: the Netherlands' constituent country of Sint Maarten, alongside the French overseas collectivity of Saint-Martin. Southwest Airlines also announced an interline partnership with EVA Air, a subsidiary of the Evergreen Group, to expand seamless travel between Asia and North America. EVA Air is the third airline partner to be announced by the Dallas-based LUV.

5. Frontier Airlines has decided to bring its service to the top 20 metro areas in the United States. As part of the expansion exercise, ULCC has decided to add 20 new routes from Detroit, Houston, Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, Charlotte and Dallas. Further growth is expected at ULCC next year. With many of the new routes overlapping with Spirit Airlines’ key markets, ULCC is likely to be a major gainer if Spirit Airlines collapses, according to a CNBC report. Spirit Airlines filed for bankruptcy last year. Despite an initial restructuring, the situation did not improve with Spirit warning last month that it may not survive another year without further cash infusions.

Airline Stocks’ Performance

The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.

The proposal involves the creation of a multinational company with countries from Central America and the Caribbean, a measure that would not only address a shared environmental issue but also provide an alternative to the international obligation to reduce emissions from commercial flights.

The International Civil Aviation Organization established that airlines must progressively decarbonize their operations starting in 2027. In this context, the utilization of sargassum as a raw material emerges as a strategic opportunity. The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Semarnat) is driving the plan as part of the transition to a circular and low-carbon economy.

Currently, sustainable aviation fuel costs more than three times the price of conventional jet fuel. To narrow this gap, the state-owned company Airports and Auxiliary Services (ASA) has announced a multimillion-dollar investment to expand its plant in Cancun, where biofuel will be produced from waste oil and, in the future, from sargassum.

The project would allow for an energy use of one of the most problematic macroalgae in the Caribbean, which covers thousands of kilometers of beaches each year, generating significant environmental, economic, and social impacts. However, experts warn that fuel production alone does not solve the risks associated with its massive accumulation on the coasts.

## An ecological alternative to harness this macroalgae

The utilization of sargassum as sustainable fuel is proposed as a promising alternative to convert an environmental liability into an energy opportunity. However, experts insist that the key lies in designing comprehensive policies: from safer collection systems to investments in research to better understand the cycle of this macroalgae.

In a scenario of global climate crisis, the challenge is not only to transform waste into energy but also to ensure that the solutions consider both environmental protection and the well-being of the communities that depend on the sea.

**[Sargassum environmental challenge in the Caribbean](https://noticiasambientales.com/innovacion/reinventando-el-sargazo-como-el-caribe-esta-convirtiendo-su-mayor-problema-ambiental-en-una-solucion-innovadora/)**

The uncontrolled arrival of sargassum in Mexico and other Caribbean countries has altered the dynamics of coastal ecosystems. The accumulation of tons of algae on beaches causes the death of fish, turtles, and corals by hindering water oxygenation and releasing toxic substances during decomposition. These processes deteriorate essential habitats for marine biodiversity.

The impact also affects human communities. In Quintana Roo, beach cleaning is largely done manually and under unsafe conditions for workers. The decomposition of sargassum produces gases that can cause respiratory and skin problems, turning collection into a health risk.

Furthermore, the presence of large volumes of algae directly affects tourism, the region’s main economic driver. Hotels and municipalities invest millions of pesos each season in removing sargassum, but the phenomenon continues to intensify due to climate change and pollution that fuels its proliferation in open sea.

The declaration of a national emergency, repeatedly requested, aims to ensure resources and federal-level coordination to tackle the problem. Without structural measures, the pressure on ecosystems and coastal communities will continue to increase.",https://storage.googleapis.com/media-cloud-na/2025/09/sargazo-scaled.jpg.webp,N,,2025-09-01 16:56:09.653501

Business Class with More Space

Business class passengers enjoy seats in the forward rows, separated by a movable curtain for privacy. Starting in October 2025, each Business class customer will have an empty seat beside them, enhancing onboard comfort.

Complimentary Connectivity

During the flight, all passengers have access to ultra-high-speed Wi-Fi free of charge by simply linking their Flying Blue account—the Air France-KLM group’s loyalty program. The company is progressively rolling out this service across its entire fleet, including regional aircraft.

A Bright Design with French Identity

The Embraer 190’s cabin reflects the same aesthetic line as the Airbus A220. It features the brand’s characteristic blue tones, contrasted with white and accented by red touches representing Air France’s excellence.

The seatbacks feature a central grey-thread embroidery, creating a quilted effect. The headrest displays the Air France “accent” motif, also visible on the cabin’s rear panels. The carpeting revives the classic herringbone pattern, evocative of Parisian Haussmann-style apartments.

Innovation and Sustainability in the New Seats

The seats were designed and manufactured in Angers (Maine-et-Loire) by the French company Expliseat, in collaboration with designer Andrea Mocellin, an expert in high-end products.

Their structure combines carbon fiber, titanium, and aluminum, achieving high strength with minimal weight. The majority of their components are made from recycled materials, thereby promoting a circular economy within the aviation industry.

This article was curated together with Carbon Removal India Alliance (CRIA) — India’s only durable carbon removal (CDR)-focused industry coalition.

India’s climate policy landscape is undergoing a pivotal transformation. Recent developments signal a shift from ambition to action, with foundational frameworks now taking shape across emissions management, carbon markets, international cooperation, and climate finance.

1. Mandatory Emission Intensity Targets For High-Emission Industries

The Government of India has issued draft rules under the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), 2023, introducing mandatory Greenhouse Gas Emission Intensity (GEI) targets for five hard-to-abate sectors: Aluminum, Iron & Steel, Petroleum Refineries, Petrochemicals, and Textiles. Entities that outperform their targets can earn tradable carbon credits, while those that underperform must purchase credits or face penalties.

This is a critical step toward operationalizing India’s carbon market and providing clarity to industry. The draft notification is open for public comments for 60 days from its publication.

2. India–Japan Joint Credit Mechanism (JCM): A Bilateral Boost For Decarbonization

India and Japan are reportedly finalizing a Joint Credit Mechanism (JCM) under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, enabling Japanese firms to invest in and deploy carbon-reduction technologies in India to receive emission reduction credits. Target sectors include solar energy, green hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This partnership offers India a strategic opportunity to channel international finance into underdeveloped clean energy sectors (potentially including CDR) and leverage Japanese technical expertise. Read more on the India–Japan JCM here.

3. Climate Finance Taxonomy: A New Framework For Capital Allocation

India’s Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance has released a Draft Climate Finance Taxonomy, a landmark step toward aligning financial flows with climate goals. The taxonomy aims to guide investments into mitigation, adaptation, and transition activities.

4. The State of Punjab Begins Journey Towards Using Biochar Carbon Removal To Abate Air Pollution

The Carbon Removal India Alliance (CRIA) and GDi Partners, with support from the Punjab Development Commission, Open Philanthropy, and the Nand & Jeet Khemka Foundation, co-organized a pivotal convening in April on “Biochar for Crop Residue Management & Climate Resilience” in Punjab. The event featured a Biochar Developers Showcase and panel discussions on policy, scaling, and finance, fostering connections and collaborative pathways for large scale biochar adoption in Punjab. Please find the key takeaways from the discussion here.

Looking Ahead

These policy shifts mark a directional progress for India’s climate strategy. By embedding emissions intensity targets, enabling international credit mechanisms, laying the groundwork for climate-aligned finance, and climate resilient agricultural supply chains, India is creating the enabling environment needed for CDR to scale responsibly and equitably.

The Carbon Removal India Alliance (CRIA) remains committed to supporting this transition by fostering research, field validation, and pilot projects that advance the carbon removal ecosystem in India.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image1.jpeg,N,,2025-09-01 13:56:30.166047

Panasonic has officially opened its expanded and modernized heat pump factory in Pilsen, Czech Republic, following a €320 million ($348 million) investment that will transform the site into one of Europe’s largest heat pump production hubs. The upgraded facility will have capacity to manufacture up to 1.4 million units annually by 2030, serving fast-growing demand across the continent.

The project represents a strategic shift of production and R&D from Southeast Asia to Europe, boosting regional supply resilience while reducing emissions through localized manufacturing. Prime Minister Petr Fiala, attending the opening ceremony, said: “The opening of this state-of-the-art heat pump production facility strengthens the competitiveness of Czech industry, brings new skilled jobs, and confirms that the Czech Republic offers attractive conditions for technologically demanding and innovative projects. Our government will continue to actively support these investments.”

Aligned with Panasonic’s Green Impact strategy, the Pilsen site is operated as a Net Zero factory, powered by a rooftop 1 MW solar system and renewable energy purchases. The facility’s smart building management system reduces waste and energy use, while water conservation is achieved through rainwater capture and reuse. From 2026, its vehicle fleet will shift to electric models.

Toshikatsu Fukunaga, CEO of Panasonic HVAC Europe, highlighted the importance of the investment: “At Panasonic, we see Europe as particularly advanced when it comes to sustainability, and therefore the acceptance of sustainable energy solutions. Our investment into the Pilsen factory demonstrates both our confidence in the growth of the market and our ability to anticipate and meet future demand.”

The expansion also integrates a new R&D center in collaboration with the Technical University of Ostrava and the University of West Bohemia. By 2028, the local team will manage the full development lifecycle of air-to-water heat pumps, supported by advanced robotics, AI-driven automation, and close coordination with Panasonic’s global network.

Radek Vach, Business Planning Director at Panasonic HVAC CZ, noted: “By placing further R&D capabilities and production together on the same site, we’ll be able to ensure that the factory is able to rapidly and nimbly anticipate and respond to the evolving needs of this key market. There will also be cost savings associated with reduced logistics, in addition to the speed and flexibility associated with bringing R&D and production together.”

Paul Kenny, Director General of the European Heat Pump Association, underscored the wider market impact: “The heat pump sector is boosting Europe’s energy security, our economy and our path to decarbonisation by replacing fossil fuel imports with a clean, locally made and locally powered solution. Today’s factory reopening is both a big step forward on that journey and a clear message to decision-makers from one of the world’s leading companies, that the future is bright in European manufacturing and that heat pumps will inevitably be at the heart of our future global energy system.”

With the European heat pump market valued at €12.2 billion in 2024 and forecast to exceed €71 billion by 2034, Panasonic’s investment in Pilsen positions the company as a central player in Europe’s transition to clean heating and cooling solutions.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Panasonic-Invests-348m-in-Czech-Heat-Pump-Factory.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 20:56:22.010843

Since 2005, this modified aircraft – capable of flying with five engines – has played a vital role in developing cutting-edge engines such as the Trent 1000 and Pearl 10X.

It made history in 2021 by flying a Trent 1000 powered entirely by 100% sustainable aviation fuel and played a key role in the subsequent certification of its durability enhancement package, which will more than double time on wing.

Its final mission, completed in July 2025, supported the company’s Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System (ALECSys) engine demonstrator, marking a significant step towards delivering more efficient and sustainable engines.

John Knight, director of test and experimental engineering within Rolls-Royce’s Engineering, Technology & Safety (ET&S) division, explained: “With more than 2,000 hours of testing under its belt, the Flying Test Bed has been a workhorse for us over the last 20 years, helping us push the boundaries on engine development.

“Whilst we say a fond farewell to our Queen of the Skies, we continue to innovate in testing with a combination of flying test beds, ground testing, and advanced digital modelling.”

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

One FTB test with a difference took place in 2021, when it was used to test a Trent 1000 engine running on 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, while its other three RB211 engines ran on “standard” jet fuel. The three-hour 54-minute flight from Tucson Airport, Arizona over Texas and New Mexico confirmed there were no engineering issues and was part of our wider, and now-completed, programme to confirm our in-production engines are compatible with 100% SAF.

Notably, this test was a key enabler to Virgin Atlantic’s world’s first transatlantic flight in 2023 using 100% SAF with a Trent 1000-powered Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

This made Rolls-Royce the first jet engine manufacturer to publicly confirm all our in-production engines for long-haul aircraft and business jets are compatible with 100% SAF and was an important milestone for both Rolls-Royce and the wider aviation industry. It also provided further evidence of our commitment to becoming a net zero company by 2050 and supporting our customers to do the same.

At the time, Simon Burr, group director of ET&S, said: This is an important milestone, not just for Rolls-Royce, but also for the wider civil aerospace industry. We hope the success of these tests provides a level of technical validation that supports those who seek to invest in the production of 100% SAF going forward.”

UltraFan

From carbon/titanium fan blades to low-emission combustion systems, the FTB has been instrumental in validating UltraFan technologies under real-world conditions.

In 2014, a set of composite carbon/titanium (CTi) fan blades – designed for Advance and UltraFan engine designs – successfully took to the skies for the first time incorporated into the FTB, marking another major milestone for the programme.

More recently, the FTB has enabled Rolls-Royce to complete the latest phase of flight testing for its Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System (ALECSys). The insights gathered directly support UltraFan development by reducing risk and enhancing maturity of future combustion systems.

By testing these critical technologies in flight, the FTB ensures systems are ready for the next-generation of engines.

Pearl 10X

The FTB’s most noticeable test configuration came with the testing of the Pearl 10X. This engine is the third and most powerful member of the market-leading Pearl engine family for the business aviation market and has been optimised to exclusively power Dassault’s new flagship aircraft, the Falcon 10X. In order to complete its rigorous flight test programme, our teams had to design a bespoke pylon to enable it to sit on the FTB’s starboard wing, alongside two RB211s. On the port wing was a third RB211 and a Trent 1000, giving the FTB its unique and eye-catching five engine setup. While the cockpit contained engine controls for all five engines, the pilots focused on the RB211s and Trent 1000, while a Pearl 10X engine operator sat on the engineering deck next to the flight test engineer and controlled that engine, all the time maintaining continuous headset communication with the cockpit.

This testing programme showed the incredible flexibility of the aircraft, as well as the ingenuity of our people and partners to make the configuration work.",https://www.aero-mag.com/image-assets/273280ab777bccf9a0a3fa5a23fc7072.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 12:56:15.062101

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as a critical tool in this transition, but its viability as a long-term investment hinges on balancing regulatory pressures, production scalability, and strategic corporate partnerships.

The Cost Conundrum of Green Mandates

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has been a vocal critic of policies that prioritize speed over feasibility. The EU’s mandate to import SAF from outside Europe, for instance, has been labeled “a great green scam” by IATA Director General Willie Walsh, who argues that the policy ignores the carbon footprint of transporting SAF across continents [1]. In 2025, SAF costs in Europe are 4.2 times higher than conventional jet fuel—a jump from 3.1 times in 2024—largely due to compliance fees imposed by suppliers under EU and UK regulations [2]. These fees, which IATA calls “profiteering,” have added $1.7 billion in costs to airlines this year alone [3].

The association warns that such mandates risk stifling innovation by diverting capital from research and development to compliance. IATA estimates that achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 will require $4.7 trillion in investment, a figure that should not be inflated by policies that prioritize political expediency over economic realism [1].

Strategic Partnerships as a Path Forward

British Airways, however, offers a counterpoint to IATA’s skepticism. The airline has signed multi-year SAF supply agreements with companies like EcoCeres and Twelve, aiming to use at least 10% SAF by 2030 under the UK government’s mandate [4]. These partnerships leverage waste-based feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, to produce SAF with up to 80% lower lifecycle emissions than traditional jet fuel [4].

But British Airways’ strategy goes beyond procurement. The airline and its parent company, IAG, are co-investing in SAF production facilities to reduce costs and secure supply chains. This approach mirrors IATA’s call for government incentives over mandates, as private-sector investment can drive economies of scale. For example, British Airways’ parent company has committed to funding SAF plants that convert non-competitive feedstocks into fuel, a move that could lower production costs and increase availability [5].

Scalability Challenges and Market Realities

Despite these efforts, scalability remains a major hurdle. SAF currently accounts for just 0.7% of global airline fuel consumption in 2025, and production must increase exponentially to meet regulatory targets [3]. The industry faces three key constraints:

1. Feedstock Limitations: Waste-based biomass, the primary feedstock for SAF, is finite and often diverted from other renewable energy sectors [4].

2. Supply Chain Complexity: Producing SAF requires integrating disparate logistics networks for feedstock collection, refining, and distribution—a process that is both capital-intensive and geographically fragmented [2].

3. Cost Barriers: Even with co-investment, SAF remains 4.2 times more expensive than conventional fuel, deterring widespread adoption without subsidies [2].

Regulatory Dynamics: A Double-Edged Sword

The tension between mandates and incentives underscores a broader debate: Should regulators enforce strict SAF quotas, or should they prioritize market-driven solutions? IATA advocates for the latter, urging governments to harmonize global SAF policies to avoid a patchwork of conflicting regulations [3]. For instance, the EU’s focus on importing SAF has created a “carbon leakage” risk, where airlines shift operations to regions with laxer environmental rules [1].

British Airways’ experience suggests that a hybrid approach—combining targeted mandates with financial incentives—could work. The airline’s partnerships are supported by UK government grants for SAF infrastructure, illustrating how policy can align with private-sector goals [5].

Conclusion: Weighing Risks and Opportunities

For investors, SAF presents a high-risk, high-reward proposition. The sector’s growth is contingent on resolving three key questions:

1. Can production costs be slashed through technological innovation and scale?

2. Will governments shift from punitive mandates to incentive-based policies?

3. Can airlines like British Airways replicate their partnership models across the industry?

The answers will determine whether SAF becomes a cornerstone of aviation’s green transition or a cautionary tale of overambitious regulation. For now, the path forward requires a delicate balance—leveraging corporate innovation while pushing for regulatory frameworks that prioritize practicality over political theater.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 12:56:18.346636

– AU$100 million+ committed to SAF from the AU$400 million Climate Fund.","(SYDNEY) Qantas has stepped up its clean-fuel push with a run of 2025 moves that put sustainable aviation front and center on trans‑Tasman and long‑haul routes, while pressing Canberra for policy support to build a homegrown supply chain.

In May, working with Sydney Airport and Ampol, the carrier completed Australia’s largest-ever commercial importation of SAF, landing nearly 2 million litres of unblended SAF from Malaysia for blending and use in Sydney’s fuel system. The batch is being blended at about 18% with conventional jet fuel and is set to power roughly 900 Qantas and Jetstar flights between Sydney and Auckland. Qantas estimates those operations will cut about 3,400 tonnes of carbon dioxide—roughly the same as taking 800 cars off the road for a year—showing how targeted use of sustainable aviation fuel can deliver real, near-term cuts even as wider industry change takes time.

Recent commitments and operational context

Qantas says this is not a one-off. In August, the airline announced it will use more than 100 million litres of SAF per year from Los Angeles International Airport for the next three years, a major boost to its international uptake.

Over the past financial year (July 2024–June 2025), Qantas reported:

– Lower fuel costs overall but higher total fuel consumption.

– Average SAF use of 181 barrels per day (about 0.2% of total fuel burned), up 5% from 172 barrels per day the prior year.

This is a small share but represents a steady lift in a system that depends on strict testing, supply chain adjustments, and airport infrastructure.

Funding, partnerships and strategic goals

Qantas frames these steps as part of a broader climate plan anchored by its AU$400 million Climate Fund. More than AU$100 million from that pool is now directed at SAF and other decarbonisation work.

Key strategic elements:

– Scale up supply quickly where possible.

– Prove demand through real-world use on scheduled flights.

– Help build first local plants able to produce large volumes at competitive prices.

Notable investments and partnerships:

– In April 2025, Qantas and Airbus invested AU$15 million in Climate Tech Partners, a venture fund focused on early-stage SAF technologies.

– Sydney Airport signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Qantas targeting 50% of all fuel uplift at the airport coming from SAF by 2050.

Coalition building and demand signaling

Qantas leads a SAF coalition with 15 major Australian and global companies, including Australia Post, Accenture, ANZ, BCG, Commonwealth Bank, Deloitte, Fortescue, IMC, ING Australia, PwC Australia, Raytheon Australia, Sydney Airport, Woodside Energy, and Xero.

Many coalition members use a book‑and‑claim model—an accounting approach that lets them pay to support SAF used on certain flights even if their employees’ flights do not physically use that exact fuel. The aim is to speed demand signals while the physical supply chain catches up.

Targets and regulatory context

Public targets:

– 10% SAF in Qantas’s total fuel mix by 2030

– 60% by 2050

– Net Zero by 2050

These align with global aviation regulator direction and international mandates such as Europe’s ReFuelEU policy and the UK’s planned SAF mandate, which are raising blend levels and driving production targets.

Economic and national benefits of onshore production

Qantas argues onshore production could deliver broad national benefits:

– Potentially add about AU$13 billion to GDP per year by 2040

– Support around 13,000 jobs in feedstock supply

– Create about 5,000 roles at new facilities

Benefits include fuel security, turning local waste streams and sustainable crops into jet fuel to buffer against global oil shocks and supply bottlenecks. Fiona Messent, Qantas’s Chief Sustainability Officer, called SAF the airline’s most workable near-term decarbonisation tool, stressing jobs, resilience, and long-term cost control from building capacity onshore.

Airbus partnership and government asks

Airbus has become a close partner. Julie Kitcher, Airbus’s Chief Sustainability Officer, has said scaling SAF requires new ways of working across the sector and that Australia is well placed to lead.

Joint asks to government:

– Direct incentives and research grants for the first two to three domestic producers.

– Ongoing support for 10–15 years to lower investment risk and accelerate industry build-out.

Existing SAF contracts and passenger impact

SAF history and supply:

– Qantas began buying SAF in 2022 (London Heathrow and California).

– Current contracts supply around 10 million litres/year from Heathrow and 20 million litres/year from California.

– New Los Angeles commitment: >100 million litres/year for three years (starting 2025).

Passenger experience:

– The shift is largely invisible to passengers: blended fuel meets strict standards, burns cleanly in existing engines, and requires no changes to aircraft hardware.

How SAF is processed and delivered at Sydney

The process at Sydney follows a clear chain:

1. Importation: Unblended SAF arrives at a local terminal such as Ampol’s Kurnell facility.

2. Blending: SAF is mixed with conventional jet fuel at about 18%.

3. Testing and Certification: Strict lab testing and certification to meet aviation standards.

4. Distribution: Certified blend enters the airport’s supply network and is loaded onto aircraft.

5. Usage and Reporting: Airlines use the blend on scheduled flights and track emissions savings.

This May shipment will power about 900 Sydney–Auckland flights, providing a pilot large enough to deliver measurable emissions cuts and to prove operational readiness.

Scale-up: from imports to industry build‑out

Qantas’s Climate Fund (AU$400 million) plus AU$100 million+ directed to SAF aims to bridge early pilots and steady supply.

The airline’s pitch to government:

– Focus support on a limited number of first producers to reach commercial output sooner.

– Align Australia with the US and Europe, where public policy already drives early SAF plants.

Analysis from VisaVerge.com notes that markets with long-term support attract the first commercial refineries, while late movers face higher catch-up costs or continued import reliance.

Regional economic and workforce impacts

Qantas forecasts:

– AU$13 billion annual GDP boost by 2040

– Roughly 18,000 combined jobs across feedstock and facilities

Skills needed range from chemical engineering and quality control to logistics and project finance, requiring training programs and regional planning to match plant build-outs.

Policy stakes and recommendations

Industry position:

– Targeted production incentives

– Support for research and early engineering

– Clear, bankable rules lasting 10–15 years

Environmental groups welcome momentum but urge:

– Faster action

– Robust feedstock rules to ensure sustainability and prevent competition with food production

Market dynamics and corporate demand

Corporate travel buyers are monitoring SAF closely; many have emissions goals and can use book‑and‑claim to support SAF now.

As volumes grow, corporations will expect broader physical access to blended fuel and routes covered by SAF, including across Asia.

Qantas’s coalition provides a forum to coordinate demand and share costs to keep the early market viable.

Technical, logistical and safety considerations

The May import shows the detailed nuts-and-bolts required:

– Import paperwork, blending, lab testing, certification, and on‑airport distribution must align.

– Each step includes safety checks to ensure blended fuel meets global standards.

– Operational data from the Sydney–Auckland flights will help engineers and teams refine processes before larger volumes arrive.

Airports and energy companies will need hardware upgrades as blends rise:

– Storage tanks, pipelines, and blending equipment must meet safety and quality rules.

– Sydney’s early moves, supported by Ampol, indicate upgrades are manageable with planning.

Timeline and next milestones

Planned and expected developments:

– Planned biofuel facilities in Queensland and New Zealand, with output expected around 2028.

– To reach 10% SAF by 2030, local plants must feed major Australian airports within a few years, complementing imports.

– Australian government may announce production incentives and R&D backing within 12–18 months—policy certainty would help final investment decisions.

Summary — headline numbers and outlook

Key figures:

– Nearly 2 million litres of unblended SAF imported into Sydney (May 2025).

– Blended at about 18%, supporting roughly 900 flights and trimming ~3,400 tonnes of CO2.

– Qantas SAF average: 181 barrels per day in 2024–25 (up 5% year on year).

– >100 million litres/year locked in from Los Angeles for three years.

– AU$100 million+ committed to SAF from the AU$400 million Climate Fund.

– AU$15 million invested with Airbus into a venture fund for early-stage tech.

– MoU with Sydney Airport aimed at 50% SAF uplift by 2050.

These moves will not deliver net zero overnight but show a practical path to cutting aviation emissions while protecting long‑haul connectivity. If government policy supports the first local plants with incentives and R&D backing, Australia could transition from buyer of imported blends to regional producer—supporting jobs, fuel security, and more affordable SAF over time.

For travelers: aircraft, pilots and safety standards remain the same — the change is in the tanks.

""In 2025 alone, we project cutting CO₂ emissions by approximately 400 metric tonnes at our Mirabel site thanks to the 170,000 litres of pure SAF we will integrate to our activities,"" said Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada.

""And we're pushing our ambition further with this ferry flight with PoS credits for 50% SAF – a significant step that comes just ahead of Air France’s 50th A220 delivery later this year.

“On a global scale, 78% of Airbus aircraft were delivered with SAF blend for the first half of the year, underscoring the importance our customers place on decarbonisation.""

Air France’s first A220-300s are part of a total firm order of 60 aircraft and began flying in its network in October 2021.

Alongside the capability to use SAF, these aircraft can deliver up to 25% lower fuel burn and CO₂ emissions per seat compared to previous generation aircraft.

Airbus has been using SAF in its operations for nearly a decade and has committed to increasing the share of SAF used to power its internal operations to at least 30% by 2030.

Technology like edge computing and machine learning isn’t just for tech-forward developers anymore — it’s becoming the baseline for efficient, resilient buildings.

1. Edge computing: Decisions made on the spot

Think of edge computing as putting the “brain” of a building closer to where things happen. Instead of sending every piece of data to a remote server, the system processes much of it on-site.

Why does that matter? Because it lets buildings react in real time. Air conditioning adjusts when a meeting room fills up. Lighting dims as natural sunlight floods in. And if a sensor notices a mechanical issue, the system can trigger maintenance alerts immediately instead of waiting for overnight data syncing.

The bonus? It also cuts bandwidth use and keeps more sensitive building data in-house, which is increasingly important as cybersecurity standards tighten.

2. Machine learning: From numbers to action

Every modern building generates more data than most teams know what to do with. Machine learning changes that by spotting patterns humans can’t.

Over time, these systems learn what “normal” looks like for a specific building. They can flag subtle signs of equipment wear or tweak schedules for elevators and HVAC to better match actual use. Platforms like Smart Building Platform – CIM bring all that information together, helping operators shift from reactive fixes to proactive decisions that save time and money.

It’s interesting to see how these tools change throughout time. The algorithms alter when tenant behavior changes or occupancy changes, so the building maintains working smoothly without anyone having to manually update every setting.

3. Regulations pushing smarter systems

New energy and emissions rules are showing up everywhere, from major cities to smaller municipalities. For CRE operators, that means keeping closer tabs on how buildings perform and proving compliance with hard data.

Smart systems simplify that. Real-time energy dashboards and automated reports turn what used to be weeks of manual checks into a streamlined process. For operators, it’s less about chasing compliance and more about using that same data to cut costs and improve sustainability scores — a win on both sides.

4. Making buildings feel better

Tenants don’t care about “edge nodes” or “ML models” — they just want spaces that work. Smart buildings are starting to deliver on that.

Imagine walking into your office and finding your preferred temperature already set. Or an app that tells you where the nearest meeting room is. These aren’t simply neat new items; they’re small, useful things that make buildings nicer and easier to get about.

And operators don’t have to step in all the time because the systems handle a lot of the fine-tuning in the background.

5. Cybersecurity: The quiet backbone

With more connected devices comes more risk. Hackers have started targeting building systems because they can be entry points to larger networks.

That’s why CRE operators are putting money into rigorous access controls, encryption, and networks that don’t trust anyone. These changes aren’t very spectacular, but they are incredibly necessary. Tenants want to know that their safety and information aren’t at risk because of systems that aren’t effectively safeguarded.

6. Breaking down system silos

Older buildings often run HVAC, lighting, and security on completely separate platforms. Integrating those systems used to be expensive and clunky. Now, open APIs and standardized protocols make it possible to connect them without replacing everything.

That means operators can get a full view of building performance — and make changes faster — while avoiding the cost of ripping out legacy systems.

7. Maintenance before breakdowns

One of the most practical benefits of smarter buildings is predictive maintenance. Instead of waiting for equipment to fail, sensors flag small changes that suggest trouble ahead — a slight vibration in a pump, or unusual motor temperatures.

Addressing these issues early avoids costly breakdowns and keeps tenants happier because downtime is rare. Over time, it also extends the lifespan of expensive systems, saving operators money.

8. Preparing for the unexpected

Resilience is becoming more and more important because of things like bad weather and power disruptions. Smart systems are also making things better here.

In an emergency, automated systems can adjust the flow of electricity, turn off systems that aren’t needed, or help people get to safety. Microgrids and on-site energy storage can keep vital services running even if the main grid goes down. It’s the kind of planning that helps when things don’t go as planned.

9. People first, tech second

A move toward human-centered design is what connects all of these themes. Technology is finally becoming invisible, operating in the background to make buildings safer, more efficient, and more comfortable.

The rise of platforms like Smart Building Platform – CIM reflects that change. These technologies do more than just crunch figures; they help teams administer their buildings in a way that seems natural and responsive, not overbearing or too complicated.

Conclusion

The smartest buildings won’t have the most sensors or the most impressive dashboards by 2025. They’ll be the ones that make things go more smoothly, cut down on energy waste, and develop places that people really like.

Edge computing will keep decisions local and fast. Machine learning will help us make sense of all the data we have. Regulations can be a pain, but they will make the sector use better, more environmentally friendly methods. If operators are willing to accept this change, they will get facilities that are efficient, flexible, and ready for whatever comes next.",https://techfundingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skyline.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 11:56:32.811824

Strategic Investment in Clean Aviation Technology

Qantas has said that sustainability remains a ‘key priority’ for the airline group, adding that it has committed more than AU$100 million to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other decarbonisation projects. The investment represents a substantial commitment from the carrier as it works toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, aligning with the broader aviation industry’s ambitious climate targets set by the International Civil Aviation Organization.

The Australian carrier recently expanded its SAF uptake from Los Angeles, with a commitment to use more than 100 million litres of SAF over the next three years. This commitment forms part of a broader strategy that includes sourcing SAF from multiple international locations, including London’s Heathrow Airport and California-based suppliers.

In addition to direct fuel procurement, Qantas said that it also recently invested AU$15 million in ClimateTech Partners, a venture capital fund that supports climate-focused businesses and projects. This strategic investment demonstrates the airline’s commitment to fostering innovation across the broader sustainable aviation ecosystem.

Building Australia’s Domestic SAF Industry

One of the most significant aspects of Qantas’s sustainability strategy involves developing a local sustainable aviation fuel supply chain. On the domestic front, a partnership with Sydney Airport and a number of large corporate customers enabled the ‘largest ever importation of SAF into the country’, Qantas said, a move that served as a test of Sydney’s fuel infrastructure and demonstrated industry commitment in developing a local SAF supply chain, as well as supportive policy to enable greater SAF production in Australia.

The Qantas Group and Airbus will invest up to US$200 million to accelerate the establishment of a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Australia in a landmark agreement. Due to the lack of a local commercial-scale SAF industry, Australia is currently exporting millions of tonnes of feedstock every year, such as canola and animal tallow to be made into SAF in other countries.

The airline has also made strategic investments in domestic production facilities. Agricultural by-products including sugarcane will be turned into jet fuel through investment from the Qantas Group, Airbus and the Queensland Government, at a Queensland biofuel production facility being developed by Jet Zero Australia in partnership with leading sustainable aviation fuel technology company LanzaJet. This facility is expected to produce up to 100 million litres of SAF annually once operational.

Understanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel Technology

Sustainable feedstocks include wastes for which the carbon has already been accounted in the use of the primary product or has been absorbed from the atmosphere in its production. Sustainable feedstocks are broken down through chemical processing before being built back up into a long chain hydro-carbon – making a sustainable jet fuel.

Sustainable fuels cut greenhouse gas emissions by around 80 per cent compared to traditional kerosene and are the most significant tool airlines currently have to reduce their impact on the environment – particularly given they can be used in today’s engines with no modifications. This compatibility with existing aircraft technology makes SAF a crucial bridge solution as the aviation industry develops longer-term zero-emission technologies.

Comprehensive Carbon Reduction Strategy

Beyond SAF investments, Qantas has restructured its approach to carbon offsetting. Qantas has also made adjustments to its Voluntary Carbon Program, with some 70% of its carbon portfolio now comprised of nature-based products, and half of that linked to an Australia-based project. This shift reflects growing industry recognition of the importance of high-quality carbon credits and local environmental benefits.

The airline has also expanded its community engagement initiatives. Elsewhere, Qantas has also expanded its community partnerships, signing a new four-year agreement with Surf Life Saving Australia and a three-year partnership with the Australian Red Cross, as well as donating some AU$2 million in grants to regional community groups.

Strong Financial Performance Underpins Sustainability Investment

The group reported a 15% increase in underlying profit before tax for the full year, to AU$2.39 billion, and said that it expects ‘ongoing strong travel demand’ into at least the first half of its current financial year. This robust financial performance provides Qantas with the resources necessary to invest heavily in sustainability initiatives during a critical period for aviation decarbonisation.

“For everyone across the Qantas Group, this year has been all about delivery,” commented CEO Vanessa Hudson. “While we are pleased with the progress we are making, we remain focused on further improving our performance and continuing to deliver for our customers, people and shareholders.”

Explosive Growth in Global SAF Market

Qantas’s investments come at a time of extraordinary growth in the global sustainable aviation fuel market. The sustainable aviation fuel market is estimated at USD 2.06 billion in 2025. It is projected to reach USD 25.62 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 65.5%. This represents one of the fastest-growing segments in the energy sector, driven by increasing regulatory pressure and airline commitments to net-zero emissions.

The global sustainable aviation fuel market was valued at USD 1.7 billion in 2024 and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 46.2% from 2025 to 2034. The aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, with growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) solutions.

Regulatory Drivers and Industry Collaboration

The rapid expansion of SAF adoption is being driven by increasingly stringent environmental regulations worldwide. The European Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) market is experiencing significant growth, driven by stringent environmental regulations and ambitious decarbonization targets set by the European Union. The ReFuelEU Aviation initiative mandates a progressive increase in SAF blending, starting at 2% in 2025 and aiming for 70% by 2050.

Qantas has joined an alliance of airlines, an aircraft manufacturer, and energy and financing companies to help accelerate global production of aviation biofuel. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance (SAFFA) fund has been formed with anchor-investor Airbus as well as Air France-KLM, Mitsubishi HC Capital Inc., BNP Paribas, Associated Energy Group, and Burnham Sterling Asset Management.

Industry Challenges and Future Outlook

Despite the promising growth trajectory, the SAF industry faces significant challenges. Their greatest concerns centre on the availability and cost of sustainable aviation fuel, along with geopolitical tensions and the tariffs associated with growing protectionism. Currently, SAF can cost several times more than conventional jet fuel, making industry collaboration and government support crucial for scaling production.

The actions that industry and governments across the world take this year will be vital to ensure the aviation sector remains on the right flight path to meet internationally agreed targets, including reducing the carbon intensity of jet fuel by 5% by 2030 and attaining net-zero international aviation by 2050.

Strategic Positioning for the Future

The Qantas Group, which has committed to using 10 per cent SAF in its overall fuel mix by 2030, is sourcing SAF overseas, including 15 percent of its fuel use out of London currently and 20 million litres each year for flights from Los Angeles and San Francisco to Australia from 2025. This diversified sourcing strategy positions Qantas to meet its sustainability targets while supporting the development of global SAF supply chains.

We’ve established Australia’s first coalition program to support the efforts to reduce the environmental impact of aviation through the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Climate action is more effective together, and the Qantas Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition program offers our corporate partners the opportunity to help contribute to the development and future use of SAF.

As the aviation industry navigates the complex challenge of decarbonisation, Qantas’s substantial investment in sustainable aviation fuel represents both a strategic business decision and a commitment to environmental leadership. With the global SAF market projected to grow exponentially over the next decade, early investments in production capacity and supply chain development could provide significant competitive advantages while supporting the industry’s broader sustainability goals.

The success of these initiatives will be crucial not only for Qantas’s own net-zero ambitions but also for establishing Australia as a key player in the global sustainable aviation fuel market, potentially creating thousands of jobs and billions in economic value over the coming decades.

Green Energy Revolution Takes Center Stage

The largest project is Green Energy Mozambique, a US$3 billion industrial park in Sofala province that represents the centerpiece of the country’s ambitious energy transition strategy. The complex is expected to generate 10,000 direct jobs and boost production of key materials including aluminum, steel, cement, batteries, and solar panels, positioning Mozambique at the forefront of Africa’s renewable energy manufacturing sector.

This massive industrial development aligns with Mozambique’s broader $80 billion energy transition strategy announced by President Filipe Nyusi at COP28, which aims to leverage the country’s vast renewable resources to position it as a sustainable investment destination and regional energy hub by 2050.

The Green Energy Mozambique project reflects growing international confidence in the country’s renewable energy potential. With 23,000 GW of solar potential and global horizontal irradiation varying between 1,785 and 2,206 kWh/m²/year, Mozambique offers some of the most attractive conditions for solar development in Africa.

Foreign Investment Surge Demonstrates Confidence

More than 88% of total investment was directed to Sofala province, far ahead of the capital Maputo, reflecting a strategic shift toward developing the country’s industrial corridors and leveraging its extensive coastline and deep-water port infrastructure.

Foreign capital accounted for US$3.2 billion of the total investment, with contributions from investors spanning 25 countries. The funds mainly target industry, transport, communications, and services sectors, demonstrating international confidence in Mozambique’s economic prospects despite ongoing challenges.

According to UNCTAD data, Mozambique ranked fourth in Africa for foreign direct investment inflows in 2024, reaching US$3.55 billion, up from US$2.5 billion in 2023 when it placed sixth. This significant improvement positions the country among Africa’s most attractive investment destinations.

The investment surge comes as Mozambique’s national electrification program has achieved remarkable progress, with electricity access rates rising from 31% in 2018 to 60% in 2024, according to Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM). This improvement in basic infrastructure has enhanced the country’s appeal to industrial investors.

Economic Recovery After Multiple Challenges

Prime Minister Levi said the results show the Mozambican economy is rebounding after climate shocks and post-election tensions, with the private sector driving growth. The investment approval figures represent a significant achievement considering the challenges Mozambique has faced, including the aftermath of the $2 billion hidden debt scandal that rocked the country in 2016, devastating cyclones, and ongoing insurgency in the gas-rich northern Cabo Delgado province.

The country’s GDP growth is projected at 3% for 2025, recovering from 1.8% in 2024 and building on the 5.4% growth achieved in 2023. While modest, this trajectory represents steady progress for an economy that has weathered significant storms.

Strategic Policy Reforms Drive Investment Climate Improvement

The investment boom reflects the success of comprehensive reforms implemented by the Mozambican government. In recent years, Mozambique has pursued systematic reforms to attract capital, including the creation of the Investment and Export Promotion Agency (APIEX) and the adoption of a new investment law in 2023.

The revised investment law (nr. 8/2023) establishes new tax incentives for businesses, includes provisions to facilitate the transfer of land use rights (DUATs), and implements reforms specifically designed to encourage foreign direct investment. The country now offers comprehensive tax and customs incentives, along with special economic zones focused on agriculture, aquaculture, and less-developed regions.

These reforms have streamlined the investment process significantly. Foreign direct investment up to USD 250,000 no longer requires prior authorization from the Bank of Mozambique and only needs registration with commercial banks handling the transactions, reducing bureaucratic barriers that previously deterred smaller investors.

Massive Infrastructure Development Program

The investment approvals are supported by major international funding commitments that will provide the infrastructure foundation necessary for sustained economic growth. The World Bank recently approved the $100 million ASCENT Mozambique project, supplemented by an additional $31 million from the Mozambique Energy for All Multi-Donor Trust Fund, aimed at accelerating sustainable energy access across the country.

This project will provide new electricity access to nearly one million people, offer improved cooking solutions to 90,000 individuals, and connect 68 schools, clinics, and other public facilities over six years. Such infrastructure development is crucial for supporting the industrial expansion envisioned in the approved investment projects.

Additionally, the African Development Bank provided $2.5 million through its Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA) to develop renewable energy resources, including feasibility studies for solar floating power plants and energy battery storage systems across 10 sites.

Energy Sector Transformation Drives Growth

The energy sector represents the cornerstone of Mozambique’s economic transformation strategy. The country has already commissioned 125 MW of solar power plants under public-private partnerships, with 60 MW already connected to the national grid through projects like Mocuba and Metoro.

Major international energy companies are making substantial commitments to Mozambique’s energy future. The consortium of EDF, TotalEnergies, and Sumitomo Corporation was selected to develop the massive 1,500 MW Mphanda Nkuwa hydropower project on the Zambezi River, representing one of the largest renewable energy investments in Southern Africa.

This project will contribute significantly to regional energy security while establishing Mozambique as a green energy hub for southern African countries. The development reflects the growing international recognition of Mozambique’s strategic importance in the regional energy landscape.

Natural Gas Resources Complement Renewable Strategy

While renewable energy dominates the current investment focus, Mozambique’s vast natural gas reserves continue to attract significant international attention. The country possesses 180 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, representing the third-largest reserves in Africa.

The Mozambique LNG project, despite facing security challenges in Cabo Delgado province, remains a cornerstone of the country’s long-term economic strategy. The project, which received a Final Investment Decision of US$20 billion in 2019, involves plans for approximately 65 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas through a two-unit liquefaction project with expansion capacity of up to 43 million tonnes per annum.

The European Union’s consideration of natural gas as a transitional green energy source has further enhanced the investment attractiveness of Mozambique’s gas sector, potentially opening new avenues for sustainable financing of gas-to-power projects.

Financial Support Mechanisms Strengthen Investment Appeal

Prime Minister Levi highlighted the launch of a US$250 million mutual guarantee fund during the FACIM fair to support economic recovery and expand private sector participation. This fund represents a crucial financial mechanism to de-risk investments and encourage broader private sector engagement in the country’s development priorities.

The guarantee fund complements other international financial support mechanisms, including the IMF’s $456 million program approved in May 2022, which aims to reinforce Mozambique’s economic recovery while addressing challenges related to debt sustainability and encouraging good governance.

The country is also working with the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) on a second compact valued at approximately $500 million over five years, demonstrating sustained international confidence in Mozambique’s reform trajectory.

Regional Integration and Strategic Location

Mozambique’s geostrategic location as the gateway to landlocked countries in Southern Africa continues to attract logistics and transport investments. The country’s extensive coastline with deep-water ports, including the strategic ports of Maputo, Beira, and Nacala, positions it as a critical hub for regional trade flows.

The development of industrial corridors, particularly the Nacala corridor mentioned in the government’s energy strategy, represents a key component of the country’s approach to integrated development that combines infrastructure, energy, and industrial development in coordinated packages.

Domestic investment, while smaller at US$144 million, reflects growing confidence among local entrepreneurs and businesses in the country’s economic trajectory. This domestic participation is crucial for ensuring that economic growth benefits are broadly distributed across Mozambican society.

Challenges and Risk Mitigation Strategies

Despite the positive investment momentum, Mozambique continues to face significant challenges that require careful management. The ongoing insurgency in Cabo Delgado province, while primarily affecting the northern regions, continues to create security concerns that impact investor confidence, particularly in the extractive industries.

The country remains classified as being in debt distress, although its debt is assessed as sustainable on a forward-looking basis according to the African Development Bank. Poverty remains high at an estimated 74.5% in 2023, with about 24 million people living in poverty, highlighting the critical importance of ensuring that new investments translate into broad-based economic benefits.

Climate vulnerability represents another ongoing challenge, with Mozambique ranking among the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world. However, the focus on renewable energy and climate-resilient infrastructure development in the current investment wave demonstrates the government’s commitment to building resilience while pursuing growth.

Future Outlook and Investment Prospects

The achievements announced during FACIM 2025 align with Mozambique’s strategy to strengthen its appeal to international investors while building local capacity and ensuring inclusive economic growth. The combination of policy reforms, international financial support, and major infrastructure investments creates a foundation for sustained economic expansion.

The success of the Green Energy Mozambique project and other major investments approved in the first half of 2025 could serve as catalysts for additional investment flows, particularly if the projects demonstrate successful implementation and positive returns for investors.

Looking ahead, Mozambique’s commitment to achieving universal energy access by 2030, combined with its vast renewable energy potential and strategic location, positions the country to play an increasingly important role in Africa’s economic development and energy transition.

The government’s ability to maintain political stability, continue implementing reforms, and effectively manage the security challenges in the north will be crucial factors determining the success of this ambitious investment program and the country’s broader economic transformation goals.

The investment approvals announced in H1 2025 represent more than just economic statistics – they signal Mozambique’s emergence as a serious contender in Africa’s race for sustainable development and energy leadership, offering hope for millions of citizens seeking prosperity after years of adversity.

By 2032, millions of tonnes of green hydrogen—and its derivatives—could be flowing from Jamnagar.","When Reliance Industries dropped its blockbuster plan at the 2025 AGM, it wasn’t just another corporate update—it was a signal flare. India’s gearing up to turbocharge hydrogen production and rewrite the playbook on sustainable energy. Under the fresh leadership of Anant Ambani, the aim is to fire up a battery gigafactory by 2026 and ramp green hydrogen output to three million tonnes a year by 2032. And they’re doing it all at Jamnagar in Gujarat, the same campus already famous for housing one of the world’s biggest refineries.

From Refineries to Renewables

It’s wild to think that the sprawling site where Dhirubhai Ambani kick-started Reliance back in 1966—dominating oil refining and petrochemicals—is now morphing into the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex. With seamless road and marine links to Kandla port, Jamnagar is perfectly poised to feed both homegrown demand and export markets. The burning question? How fast can this pivot propel India toward its National Green Hydrogen Mission of five million tonnes by 2030, all while accelerating industrial decarbonization?

Battery Gigafactory by 2026

First up on the clean-energy hit list is a state-of-the-art battery gigafactory. Reliance plans to crank it up within two years, churning out advanced lithium-ion cells at gigawatt-hour scale. These batteries will do more than store power—they’ll smooth out the ups and downs of solar and wind, shore up industrial storage, and juice up transport applications. Thanks to the massive scale at Jamnagar, the idea is to slash costs, secure domestic supply chains, and make a real dent in industrial decarbonization.

Scaling Green Hydrogen

The real headline, though, is the gargantuan push into green hydrogen. By 2032, they’re targeting three million tonnes a year, all made via water electrolysis powered by solar and wind. On-site electrolysers will split water into hydrogen and oxygen with zero carbon emissions. That hydrogen can feed steel mills and fertilizer plants or turn into derivatives like green ammonia and methanol, making it a linchpin for deeper decarbonization and building out robust hydrogen infrastructure.

An Integrated Clean Fuel Ecosystem

What really makes Reliance’s strategy stand out is full value-chain integration. Beyond batteries and electrolysers, they’ve mapped out:

Solar module production to generate clean electricity

Electrolyser factories churning out gear for massive hydrogen production

Conversion plants for green ammonia and methanol

Units dedicated to sustainable aviation fuel, targeting one of the toughest sectors to decarbonize

By weaving all these pieces together, Reliance aims to capture value at every step, cut inefficiencies, shorten supply chains, and pump out export-ready fuel derivatives.

Strategic Ripples

This isn’t just about hitting lofty numbers. We’re talking new jobs and high-tech manufacturing skills pouring into Gujarat, sparking fresh industrial clusters around Jamnagar. On the home front, reliable battery storage and a steady hydrogen supply will boost grid stability and trim fossil-fuel dependence. On the global stage, exporting green ammonia and methanol could swing trade balances in India’s favor, cementing its status as a go-to clean-energy supplier.

Of course, there are hurdles: keeping these new fuels cost-competitive against traditional options, scaling electrolysis technology, and building out comprehensive hydrogen infrastructure. But Reliance’s big move dovetails with a worldwide rush—governments and companies alike are racing to lock in green-hydrogen ground before the market standards snap into place.

The Road Ahead

Come 2026, we should see the first batteries rolling off the line. By 2032, millions of tonnes of green hydrogen—and its derivatives—could be flowing from Jamnagar. The true test will be whether this end-to-end approach can drive down costs, spark exports, and help India—and Reliance—lead the global clean-energy transition. One thing’s for sure: this pivot is worth watching.",https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/resized-1756490719682.jpeg,N,,2025-09-01 10:56:36.492519

The regulatory reforms, privatization efforts, and strategic partnerships are creating a fertile ground for international investment.","Kenya’s oil sector is undergoing a transformative phase, marked by regulatory reforms, privatization initiatives, and strategic partnerships that are reshaping the investment landscape for international energy firms. As the country moves closer to commercializing its long-anticipated oil reserves, the opportunities for foreign investors are expanding, but so are the complexities of navigating a rapidly evolving market.

A Regulatory Framework Designed for Investment

The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) has been central to Kenya’s efforts to create a transparent and investor-friendly environment. By the end of 2025, EPRA aims to finalize seven key upstream regulations, including local content requirements, cost management, and environmental standards. These rules mandate foreign firms to partner with local companies, prioritize Kenyan goods and services, and invest in staff training and research collaborations with Kenyan institutions [1]. Such provisions not only align with global best practices but also ensure that foreign investment contributes to local economic development.

The emphasis on local content is particularly significant. For instance, Gulf Energy’s acquisition of Tullow Oil’s assets in the South Lokichar Basin—a project expected to produce 100,000 barrels per day by 2026—has already demonstrated the importance of local partnerships. Gulf Energy’s ability to secure regulatory approval for its Field Development Plan (FDP) hinges on its commitment to these local content requirements [2].

Privatization and Market Liberalization

Kenya’s privatization agenda is another critical entry point for international investors. The government’s decision to launch an Initial Public Offering (IPO) for the Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) in September 2025, offering up to 65% of its shares to the public, signals a broader push to open the energy sector to private capital. This move is part of a sweeping privatisation plan aimed at raising funds for the 2025/2026 budget and deepening Kenya’s capital markets [3].

The KPC IPO is not just a financial milestone but a strategic one. By partnering with Capital FM to communicate its sustainability and energy efficiency initiatives, KPC is positioning itself as a modern, transparent entity—a model that could attract both institutional and retail investors [4]. For international firms, this privatization trend underscores the potential for long-term partnerships in infrastructure and logistics, particularly as Kenya seeks to expand its oil export capabilities.

Strategic Partnerships and Collaborative Models

Kenya’s energy sector is increasingly defined by strategic alliances between local and international players. The National Oil Corporation of Kenya (NOC) has recently partnered with RUBiS Energy Kenya, a non-equity strategic partner, to revitalize its operations. This collaboration includes financial support, technical expertise, and plans to rebrand and expand NOC’s retail network [5]. Such partnerships highlight the value of hybrid models that combine foreign capital with local market knowledge.

Similarly, Kenya’s renewed oil supply agreement with Gulf state-owned giants—Saudi Aramco, Emirates National Oil, and Abu Dhabi National Oil Corporation—extends a 180-day credit framework for fuel imports, ensuring energy security while providing fiscal flexibility [6]. These agreements, which build on Kenya’s historical ties with the Gulf, illustrate how international firms can leverage existing relationships to secure a foothold in the market.

The Road Ahead: Licensing Rounds and Renewable Synergies

Kenya’s upcoming oil and gas licensing round, scheduled for September 2025, will offer 10 exploration blocks to international firms, signaling the government’s intent to accelerate resource development [7]. This round, coupled with the anticipated commercialization of the Lokichar Basin by 2026, creates a window for firms to secure exploration rights before the market matures.

However, Kenya’s energy strategy is not solely focused on oil. The country is also a leader in renewable energy, with strong progress in geothermal, solar, and clean cooking solutions. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has highlighted Kenya’s commitment to universal electricity access and its pioneering role in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) [8]. For international firms, this dual focus on traditional and renewable energy presents opportunities to diversify their portfolios, particularly as global demand for cleaner energy grows.

Conclusion: A Market at the Crossroads

Kenya’s oil sector is at a pivotal juncture. The regulatory reforms, privatization efforts, and strategic partnerships are creating a fertile ground for international investment. Yet, success will depend on firms’ ability to navigate a complex landscape that balances commercial interests with local development goals. For those willing to engage deeply—with a focus on collaboration, sustainability, and adaptability—Kenya offers not just a market, but a platform for shaping the future of energy in Africa.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 10:56:45.813302

By Farhiya Farah

The Africa Climate Summit I (ACS I), held in Nairobi from 4–6 September 2023, was positioned as Africa’s moment to reclaim its influence in global climate diplomacy.

Building on the outcomes of COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Nairobi Summit centred on climate finance, locally led solutions, nature-based approaches, and green energy.

The resulting Nairobi Declaration mapped out policy and financing pathways for a unified African position, called for reforms to global financial systems, and tasked the African Union Commission (AUC) with developing an implementation framework.

While institutionalising ACS as a biennial AU process was a breakthrough, critics, including the Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), argued that the Declaration fell short by failing to consolidate political will and adequately centre frontline communities.

Concerns included underfunding, overreliance on carbon markets, and limited inclusion of civil society and Indigenous peoples.

Gaps identified after Nairobi

Despite significant pledges (USD 26 billion), the Nairobi Summit revealed three key gaps:

Insufficient finance: Funding fell far short of the promised USD 100 billion annually. Adaptation remained underfunded, and access to finance was often slow, complex, and costly.

Division among African states: Some countries advocated for continued fossil fuel use and reliance on carbon markets, while others pushed for a cleaner, faster energy transition.

Weak inclusion: Civil society, Indigenous communities, and local actors felt sidelined, undermining legitimacy.

Progress Since Nairobi.

Despite the shortcomings, four areas of progress have emerged:

Loss and Damage Fund: Established at COP28, hosted by the World Bank, with initial pledges to support water, health, and early warning systems.

Mission 300: A World Bank Group and AfDB initiative to connect 300 million Africans to electricity by 2030, with new financial backers. However, clean cooking remains underfunded.

Carbon Market Infrastructure: The AfDB launched an Africa Carbon Credit Support Facility to help countries establish MRV systems and ensure high-integrity credits.

AU Cadence: The ACS was institutionalised as a biennial AU event, and Kenya has advanced implementation through regulatory and policy frameworks — including the Climate Change (Carbon Markets) Regulations 2024, a National Cooking Transition Strategy (2024–2028), geothermal projects, and a Green Hydrogen Strategy.

ACS II in Addis Ababa (2025) – Expectations

The upcoming ACS II (September 8–10, 2025) in Addis Ababa is expected to consolidate Nairobi’s gains ahead of COP30 in Belém, Brazil. It faces heightened pressure to demonstrate delivery, especially in finance, nature protection, and fair transition planning before updated NDCs in 2025/26.

Key Proposals for Addis Ababa

AU Delivery Scoreboard: A quarterly, public “report card” showing progress on energy, cooking, finance disbursement, carbon market deals, and safeguards.

Finance Architecture Reform: Channel at least USD 100 billion in Special Drawing Rights through AfDB, set MDB lending stretch targets, add climate “debt-pause” clauses, and publish clear timelines.

Energy & Grids Roadmap: Reaffirm the 300 GW renewable energy by 2030 goal with detailed cross-border corridor and storage plans.

Article 6 Starter-Kit: Develop standard AU-wide templates and safeguards for carbon trading, ensuring integrity and benefit-sharing for communities.

Trade & Compliance Facility: Help African exporters adapt to the EU’s CBAM and EUDR rules and develop Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and green shipping corridors.

Broader Implications for African Climate Advocacy

The biennial ACS process gives Africa 18–24 months to design projects, adjust enabling frameworks (procurement, tariffs, safeguards), and then check progress. To ensure credibility and inclusivity, Addis Ababa must:

Put people at the centre: Fund youth-led initiatives, dedicate clean-cooking funds, and enshrine FPIC for Indigenous communities.

Back local solutions with real finance: Scale mini-grids, solar home systems, and clean cooking into full national programs; set up one-stop national “front doors” for climate finance; and budget for nature as infrastructure.

Ensure fairness and transparency: Adopt clear benefit-sharing rules, effective complaints mechanisms, and public disclosure of carbon/nature finance distribution.

Conclusion

The Nairobi Summit raised ambition but left gaps in finance, unity, and inclusivity. Addis Ababa must move from promises to delivery, with measurable outputs such as megawatts on the grid, households accessing clean cooking, finance disbursed on time, and community-benefiting carbon deals.

Nairobi promised; Addis must deliver.

The recent announcement by DHL Express and Cathay Pacific highlights a progressive step toward cleaner skies. Their agreement to use 2,400 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through Cathay’s subsidiary, Air Hong Kong, reflects an intent to lower greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate the region’s journey toward sustainable aviation.

This collaboration is more than just a fuel deal. It signals a shift in how global logistics and air cargo leaders are embracing innovation to reduce environmental impact. By drawing attention to real-world solutions, such partnerships encourage both industry and society to rethink the future of transport.

Why Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matters

Aviation is one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonize. Aircraft rely heavily on fossil-based jet fuel, and emissions from aviation account for a significant share of global greenhouse gases. Sustainable aviation fuel presents a near-term solution by reducing lifecycle emissions compared to conventional fuel.

Yet, despite its promise, SAF makes up less than one percent of the world’s jet fuel consumption. Scaling its production and adoption is critical if the industry wants to meet climate goals. Partnerships like the one between DHL and Cathay are important because they create real demand that encourages producers and suppliers to expand capacity.

The Scope of the Agreement

The SAF secured under this partnership will be used for Air Hong Kong flights departing from key Asian hubs:

Seoul Incheon International Airport

Tokyo Narita International Airport

Singapore Changi Airport

These airports are central to regional and global logistics. By incorporating SAF on routes leaving such strategic gateways, the impact becomes visible across multiple trade corridors. It demonstrates that sustainability can be woven into operations without compromising efficiency.

A Signal of Industry Leadership

DHL and Cathay Pacific are not new to sustainability discussions, but this agreement elevates their commitment into tangible action. Peter Bardens, Senior Vice President for Network Operations and Aviation in Asia Pacific at DHL Express, underscored the importance of scaling SAF. He noted that while SAF is still a small fraction of global jet fuel, increasing its use is vital to drive momentum for production and demand.

In practical terms, this sends a message to other cargo carriers, passenger airlines, and logistics companies: decarbonization is possible when businesses invest in alternatives and commit to scaling them.

Building Momentum in Asia

Asia is both a hub of economic activity and a region heavily affected by climate challenges. The decision to expand SAF usage here is symbolic as well as strategic. It aligns with broader efforts across the region to transition toward cleaner energy and supports governments aiming to reduce emissions without stifling economic growth.

This regional focus is also significant because Asia hosts some of the world’s busiest airports. Small steps taken here can amplify global results, given the volume of traffic and trade passing through. By embedding SAF into these supply chains, companies help normalize sustainable practices within international commerce.

The Broader Ripple Effect

Adopting SAF in aviation does more than reduce emissions from individual flights. It sends a signal across multiple sectors:

Fuel producers are encouraged to scale up SAF production and explore new feedstocks.

Airports are motivated to develop infrastructure to support SAF fueling.

Policy makers are shown that industry actors are serious about sustainability, which can shape regulatory support and incentives.

Customers gain confidence that logistics and transport partners are aligning with their own sustainability goals.

These ripple effects multiply the influence of a single agreement, showing how one partnership can inspire systemic change.

Making Sustainability Practical

For businesses, the question often is how to balance environmental responsibility with operational performance. The DHL and Cathay Pacific deal illustrates that sustainability is not abstract. It is about making practical decisions today that move industries closer to a low-carbon future.

Air cargo is indispensable for global supply chains, from e-commerce to critical medical shipments. Making this sector greener without slowing it down is essential. SAF provides a realistic pathway, and its adoption by leading players proves that environmental responsibility and commercial necessity can align.

Lessons for the Industry

Other companies within aviation and logistics can learn key lessons from this partnership:

Collaboration is essential – airlines, cargo carriers, and fuel producers must work together to make SAF viable at scale.

Regional strategies matter – targeting specific hubs can maximize impact and visibility.

Transparency builds trust – openly sharing commitments and actions builds credibility with customers and regulators.

Early adopters set the tone – those who act first influence the pace of adoption across the entire industry.

Looking Ahead

This deal between DHL and Cathay Pacific is unlikely to remain an isolated move. As climate pressures mount and stakeholders demand accountability, more aviation players will need to embrace SAF. The challenge lies in expanding supply, reducing costs, and ensuring that sustainability remains a central element of business strategy.

By proving that SAF can be integrated into major cargo operations across Asia, DHL and Cathay are paving the way for broader adoption. What begins as a single agreement today can become an industry-wide norm tomorrow.

Conclusion

The partnership between DHL Express and Cathay Pacific to use sustainable aviation fuel represents a forward-looking commitment to greener skies in Asia. While challenges remain in scaling SAF production, such initiatives highlight that progress is possible when leaders choose action over hesitation.

For the aviation sector, the road to net zero will require bold steps, creative partnerships, and consistent investment. By leading from the front, DHL and Cathay show that sustainability and efficiency can go hand in hand. The hope is that this momentum continues, inspiring others across the industry to join the journey toward cleaner air transport and a more sustainable global future.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-9.svg,N,,2025-09-01 13:56:37.426758

The conversations throughout the event made it clear that the country’s agribusiness is moving at full speed, driven by ambitious goals that reflect its central role in shaping the future of sustainable energy. However, the consensus among most discussions is that agricultural strength alone will not be enough to achieve these objectives. Longstanding challenges such as infrastructure bottlenecks and limited access to capital remain, while new demands from the green economy, such as traceability, diversification of feedstocks and sustainability certification, add further complexity.

Here are the highlights of what we learned at the event.

Industry participants were optimistic about Brazil’s biodiesel sector, with growing momentum toward higher blend mandates. The government’s current target of B15 is expected to move toward B20 in the coming years, with participants suggesting that even B25 could be viable in the medium term.

The implementation of higher mandates was seen as both a growth opportunity and a challenge.

While it would reinforce Brazil’s role as a global biofuels leader, speakers highlighted the need for continued investment in refining capacity, logistics and quality assurance to ensure smooth adoption at scale.

Feedstock expansion positions Brazil as a global growth driver

Optimism extended beyond biodiesel and into the wider feedstock market. Brazil’s soybean crushing and production continue to expand at a pace above the global average, reinforcing its position as a critical supplier for both domestic consumption and international demand.

Some panelists noted that diversification of feedstocks (e.g., corn oil, animal fats and future-generation inputs such as used cooking oil) will be essential to secure supply for a growing biofuels sector. While soy remains dominant, the industry is actively seeking ways to mitigate risks tied to land use and environmental pressures by broadening its feedstock base.

Traceability and certification emerge as key challenges

As global markets tighten sustainability requirements, the region’s biofuels industry faces increasing pressure to implement robust traceability and certification systems. Some discussions assessed the role of technologies such as blockchain and satellite monitoring in guaranteeing transparency across the supply chain.

Participants warned that without consistent standards and enforcement, Brazilian exporters could face market access risks in regions such as Europe and North America, where regulators and consumers are increasingly demanding verified low-carbon products.

Infrastructure and financing remain bottlenecks

Despite strong growth prospects, speakers acknowledged that infrastructure limitations continue to weigh on the competitiveness of Brazil’s biofuels sector. Access to capital markets was also highlighted as a barrier, with financing costs and credit availability remaining uneven across different regions of the country.

Public-private partnerships and targeted government incentives were pointed out as potential solutions, with calls for greater collaboration to unlock investments in logistics and processing facilities.

Brazil seen as cornerstone of global decarbonization

The overarching theme of the conference was Brazil’s strategic importance in the global decarbonization agenda. With abundant agricultural resources, expanding production capacity and growing policy support, the country is well positioned to play a central role in meeting rising global demand for renewable fuels.

Speakers highlighted that Brazil’s scale and resource base give it a competitive advantage few regions can match, while also reflecting upon the fact that global expectations are rising quickly.

It became clear that the road ahead will not be one without obstacles. However, participants agreed that the resilience of South America’s agribusiness, combined with stronger collaboration across government, finance and industry, will be essential to sustaining growth.",https://www.fastmarkets.com/tachyon/2025/07/greenenergy-immingham-biofuel-plant.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 09:56:17.109263

The facility will later be modularly scaled up to 100 GWh per annum, announced Anant Ambani, executive Director of RIL, during the company’s annual general meeting recently.

The battery factory is located within the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which also houses gigafactories for solar modules and electrolyzers.

Ambani said RIL’s electrolyzer gigafactory is also scheduled to start production by the end of 2026. This facility will have the capacity to scale up to 3 GW per year, enabling cost-competitive production of green hydrogen at a global scale. The electrolyzer plant is backed by exclusive global technology partnerships and RIL’s in-house capabilities.

The solar PV manufacturing facility at the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex is already operational. It has successfully produced its first 200 MW of high-efficiency heterojunction technology (HJT) solar modules. “These modules are demonstrating industry-leading performance—delivering 10% higher energy yield, 20% better temperature tolerance, and 25% lower degradation,” said Ambani. RIL plans to scale this facility to 10 GW of annual solar PV manufacturing capacity in the coming quarters, with further expansion to 20 GW, making it the largest and most integrated single-site solar manufacturing complex in the world.

Together, these platforms will create a multi-pronged, gigawatt-scale clean energy ecosystem housing solar, battery storage, and green hydrogen production equipment all under one roof. “This integrated approach not only delivers scale but also builds a competitive edge in cost, technology, and supply chain resilience, positioning Reliance to capture significant value as the global energy transition accelerates,” said Ambani.

“Reliance will be the world’s only fully integrated, self-sufficient new energy company,” he added.

Ambani said that work on the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex is progressing at a record pace. It will be unmatched globally in size, scale and integration. The Complex spans 44 million square feet of built-up area, equivalent to four times the size of the Tesla Gigafactory.

With this, Jamnagar becomes the cradle of both the world’s largest conventional energy complex and the world’s largest new energy complex.

RIL is also developing one of the world’s largest single-site solar projects in Kutch, Gujarat, spanning 550,000 acres of arid land, three times the size of Singapore. At peak construction, the site will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery storage containers daily. “This will be among the fastest installations globally. [Once operational] this single site could meet nearly 10% of India’s electricity needs within the next decade,” said Ambani.

RIL’s marine and land infrastructure at Jamnagar and Kandla will connect seamlessly with solar and hydrogen production sites at Kutch, facilitating large-scale export of green hydrogen and its derivates as the company scales up to 3 million metric tons per annum of green hydrogen by 2032. “We will produce and export green ammonia, green methanol and sustainable aviation fuel. This will make India a global hub for cost-competitive green hydrogen and its derivatives. While our initial focus will be to meet Reliance’s own large captive demand, we plan to scale up to 3 million metric tons per annum of green hydrogen by 2032.

This valuation reflects a stock priced for optimism, given the company’s mixed financial performance and its strategic pivot toward renewable fuels and circular economy solutions. While the stock’s elevated P/E ratio raises questions about affordability, its operational transformation and industry tailwinds suggest a compelling case for long-term investors willing to navigate near-term volatility.

Financial Performance: A Tale of Two Segments

Darling’s Q2 2025 results underscored the duality of its business model. The Feed segment delivered robust performance, generating $135.9 million in adjusted EBITDA, driven by favorable pricing and stable raw material volumes [2]. This resilience contrasts sharply with the struggles of the Fuel segment, where Diamond Green Diesel (DGD)—its 50/50 renewable fuels joint venture—saw adjusted EBITDA plummet by 44% year-over-year to $42.6 million [1]. The decline stemmed from regulatory uncertainty, including delays in Renewable Identification Number (RIN) pricing and the transition from the blenders tax credit to the producer’s tax credit [4].

Despite these challenges, Darling’s balance sheet remains a bright spot. The company reduced net debt and achieved a leverage ratio of 3.34X as of June 28, 2025 [1]. Institutional ownership of 94.44% further signals confidence in its strategic direction [4].

Operational Transformation: From Waste to Value

Darling’s operational overhaul in 2025 is anchored in two pillars: renewable fuels and value-added protein products. The company’s DGD joint venture, a leading producer of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), sold 467.8 million gallons in H1 2025 at an average EBITDA of $0.22 per gallon [1]. With SAF plants operating at or near capacity and regulatory tailwinds like the 45Z tax credit extension to 2031, DGD’s margins are poised to recover [3].

Equally significant is Darling’s foray into the health and wellness market. The recent non-binding term sheet to form Nextida—a collagen and gelatin joint venture with Tessenderlo Group—highlights its ambition to monetize waste streams from animal agriculture into premium ingredients [1]. This move aligns with growing demand for plant-based and sustainable proteins, offering a new revenue stream beyond traditional waste management.

Industry Tailwinds and Regulatory Catalysts

The renewable fuels sector is undergoing a structural shift. U.S. policy developments, including the proposed Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) of 5.25 billion gallons and Trump-era biofuel blending mandates, are expected to boost feedstock prices and demand for green diesel [1]. Darling’s CEO, Randall Stuewe, has emphasized that these changes position the company for stronger performance in H2 2025 and beyond [1].

However, risks persist. Small refinery exemptions (SREs) and overcapacity in the biofuel market could dampen demand, as evidenced by Darling’s revised 2025 EBITDA guidance of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion [5]. Analysts remain divided, with a consensus price target of $47 (38% upside) but a wide range from $36 to $50 [2].

Valuation: High P/E, Low ROE, and a Debt-Neutral Balance Sheet

Darling’s P/E ratio of 51.76 [2] is well above the S&P 500 average, reflecting investor expectations for future growth. Yet its Return on Equity (ROE) of 2.45% [2] is underwhelming, suggesting limited shareholder returns. The Debt-to-Equity ratio of 0.90 [3] indicates moderate leverage, but refinancing risks could emerge if interest rates rise.

For the stock to justify its current valuation, Darling must deliver on its operational transformation. The success of DGD’s SAF business, the scalability of Nextida, and the company’s ability to navigate regulatory headwinds will be critical.

Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on the Future

Darling Ingredients at $33.96 is a high-risk, high-reward proposition. The stock’s valuation is stretched, but its strategic alignment with renewable fuels and circular economy trends offers asymmetric upside. Investors who can stomach near-term volatility—such as SRE-related demand fluctuations or RIN price swings—may find value in Darling’s long-term vision. As the company executes its transformation, the key question remains: Can it convert waste into wealth faster than its peers?",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 07:56:10.941664

The WRI examined more than 1,000 sustainability goals set by nearly 700 of the world’s largest companies and found that while most have put in place targets related to climate and nature, people are often left out of the story – just 3% have set commitments to improve working conditions or invest in skills development.

Fit for the future

“If you are building a supply chain for the future, you can’t just cut emissions — you have to factor in the billions of people doing the work,” commented Eliot Metzger, WRI’s director of sustainable business and innovation.

“Right now, most large companies are overlooking the needs of the people essential to transforming their supply chains. This not only undermines companies’ sustainability targets but also the stability of their supply chains and their reputation.”

‘Elephant in the Boardroom’

According to the WRI‘s study, entitled Elephant in the Boardroom: People Are Missing in Corporate Supply Chain Goals, people-centred supply chain goals could focus on areas such as improving workplace safety through training and equipment, providing upskilling programmes, and ensuring fair pay and predictable timetables.

‘These actions can directly improve worker well-being while strengthening the resilience of the supply chain,’ the WRI noted.

It also found that around 90% of supply chain goals set by corporates ‘force’ smaller suppliers to comply with sustainability objectives without offering the support needed to meet them. It advocates for a partnership-based approach to emphasise mutual value.

‘This would involve larger companies engaging with suppliers to understand concrete challenges — such as financing equipment upgrades or training and retaining skilled workers — and then designing goals that provide the necessary support for suppliers to transition toward more sustainable operations,’ the WRI added.

Speaking at RIL’s annual general meeting on August 29, Anant Ambani, the company’s executive director said the solar park being built in Gujarat’s Kutch could meet nearly 10% of India's electricity needs within the next decade.

He, however, did not specify the total installed capacity planned for the solar project. Industry experts told Moneycontrol that the project would easily be upwards of 10 gigawatt (GW). To make the availability of renewable energy from the solar park round-the-clock, RIL is also setting up battery energy storage systems (BESS) at the site.

“In Kutch, Gujarat, we are developing one of the world's largest single-site solar projects spanning 5,50,000 acres of arid land – three times the size of Singapore. At peak, we will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers every day. This will be among the fastest installations globally,” Ambani said.

He stated that the renewable energy produced in this solar park will be used for RIL’s plans to produce green hydrogen, green ammonia, green methanol and SAF. All these products need pure renewable energy in their respective production processes.

In Kutch, RIL also plans to build facilities for production of green ammonia, green methanol, and SAF. “Our marine and land infrastructure at Jamnagar and Kandla will connect seamlessly with solar and hydrogen at Kutch,” Ambani said adding that the company will also export the three new energy products mentioned above.

“This will make India a global hub for cost-competitive green hydrogen and its derivatives. While our initial focus will be to meet Reliance's own large captive demand, we plan to scale up to 3 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of green hydrogen equivalent production capacity by 2032, thereby unlocking a powerful growth engine for global markets,” he said.

Reliance Industries is among the few companies that has secured incentives under India's National Green Hydrogen Mission for both green hydrogen production and electrolyser manufacturing.

Besides, RIL has also won incentives for solar module manufacturing under India's Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme in both the first and second tranches, securing allocations of over Rs 19 billion in the first round and Rs 30.98 billion in the second round to develop integrated poly-to-module manufacturing facilities.

The company did not provide any timelines for commissioning the solar park yet. But, the project is expected to start taking shape in phases, starting from the next financial year (FY27).

Hawaiian Airlines is taking a major step toward greener skies by introducing sustainable aviation fuel on its Osaka–Honolulu flights, a move made possible through a partnership with Cosmo Oil Marketing. This initiative aims to cut carbon emissions by up to 80% per flight, demonstrating how airlines can reduce their environmental footprint while continuing to connect passengers across continents.

Hawaiian Airlines (HA) is pioneering eco-friendly air travel by deploying sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on its routes between Honolulu, Hawai’i, and Osaka, Japan.This initiative comes through a strategic agreement between HA’s parent company, Alaska Air Group Inc., and Cosmo Oil Marketing Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Cosmo Energy Holdings Co., Ltd. Deliveries of SAF at Kansai International Airport (KIX) are scheduled to start this month, marking a milestone for the airline as it deploys SAF for the first time. Hawaiian Airlines highlights that SAF can reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared with conventional jet fuel, demonstrating the airline’s commitment to lowering its environmental footprint.

While the use of sustainable aviation fuel is still emerging in the United States, its growth trajectory in 2025 is notable. Policies at both federal and state levels, alongside ambitious airline targets, are driving adoption, yet SAF consumption remains a small fraction of total aviation fuel use. Experts point out that the expansion of SAF production is essential to achieving broader decarbonization goals in the aviation sector.

Rapid Expansion of SAF Production

SAF production in the U.S. has surged over recent years. From a modest 2,000 barrels per day in 2020, production climbed to approximately 19,000 barrels per day by 2023, equating to nearly 277 million gallons annually. Forecasts suggest production could reach 51,000 barrels per day by the end of 2025, which would exceed 770 million gallons annually. Despite this impressive growth, SAF currently represents less than 0.7% of total U.S. aviation fuel consumption, with overall jet fuel use surpassing 16 billion gallons per year.

The majority of new SAF output comes from co-processing renewable diesel in existing plants, a method that allows faster scale-up without building entirely new facilities. Industry analysts predict that if more facilities undergo conversion, annual SAF capacity in the U.S. could exceed 5 billion gallons within the next decade. Such an increase would provide the aviation sector with a meaningful path toward cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

Airlines Lead the Charge in SAF Adoption

Major U.S. carriers are staking significant claims in SAF procurement. United Airlines (UA) has locked in long-term contracts for 2.9 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel, planning to deploy 10 million gallons in 2025, tripling the volume used in 2022. Delta Air Lines (DL) has inked offtake contracts for 910 million gallons, targeting a 5% SAF blend across its fleet by 2030. Meanwhile, American Airlines (AA) holds 620 million gallons in future SAF purchase agreements and initiated regular annual deliveries in 2024.

Other airlines, including JetBlue (B6) and Air Canada (AC), have smaller but steadily expanding SAF programs. Notably, Air Canada plans to deploy 20.5 million gallons of Neste SAF in 2025, which represents roughly 1% of its total fuel requirements. These initiatives underscore the aviation sector’s growing reliance on SAF as a viable climate solution.

Beyond Commercial Airlines

Sustainable aviation fuel is increasingly being adopted across cargo, business, and military aviation sectors.Cargo carriers, business aviation operators, U.S. military branches, and startups are increasingly investing in SAF production, storage, and fueling infrastructure. These developments signal a broader recognition of SAF’s potential to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint and contribute to national climate targets.

Industry observers note that SAF deployment faces challenges, including high production costs, limited infrastructure, and the need for continuous policy support. However, partnerships like the one between Hawaiian Airlines and Cosmo Oil Marketing demonstrate how strategic collaborations can accelerate adoption. By integrating SAF into its Osaka-Honolulu flights, Hawaiian Airlines not only reduces its carbon emissions but also sets an example for other international carriers seeking sustainable fuel solutions.

Hawaiian Airlines will use sustainable aviation fuel on Osaka–Honolulu flights, cutting carbon emissions by up to 80% while keeping global travel seamless.

As airlines move toward achieving net-zero emissions, sustainable aviation fuel offers a practical, immediate solution to reduce greenhouse gases without disrupting international travel. Hawaiian Airlines’ SAF deployment is a step in the right direction, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges of building a more sustainable aviation ecosystem. With continued investment and innovation, SAF could transform the industry, paving the way for greener skies in the coming decade.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rana_Singh_A_Hawaiian_Airlines_B-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 07:56:14.629631

Bei der Antwort auf diese Frage kommen früher oder später immer nachhaltige Treibstoffe ins Spiel, im Jargon Sustainable Aviation Fuels genannt, kurz SAF. Sie sind die schnellste Möglichkeit, Emissionen zu senken. Viele Airlines brüsten sich darum damit, möglichst viel davon zu tanken - während sie gleichzeitig darauf hinweisen, dass die Verfügbarkeit gering und die Preise zu hoch sind.

Aber wer nutzt wirklich viel SAF - und wer gar nicht? Die International Airlines Group IAG hat Nutzungsdaten für nachhaltige Kraftstoffe analysiert. Und hat sie öffentlich gemacht. Denn: Mit 162.000 Tonnen im Jahr 2024 nutzte der Konzern, zu dem unter anderem British Airways, Iberia, Vueling und Aer Lingus gehören, weltweit die größte Menge.

Lufthansa Group erst auf Rang sechs

Wie groß die getankte Menge von IAG ist, zeigt der Vergleich mit der Konkurrenz. Laut den Daten des Konzerns, die laut Robinson auf Angaben der einzelnen Airlines beruhen, landet Air France-KLM auf Platz zwei mit rund 110.000 Tonnen, gefolgt von DHL mit 100.000. Wichtig: Die einzelnen Werte für Airlines außer IAG basieren auf einer Annäherung anhand der Grafik des IAG-Mitarbeiters - es handelt sich nicht um die absolut exakten Zahlen. IAG möchte diese nicht herausgeben.

Dann folgen mit großem Abstand mit etwa 50.000 Tonnen United Airlines und mit 40.000 Tonnen Delta Air Lines. In den USA ist die Versorgung mit nachhaltigem Kerosin besser als anderswo. Allerdings dürfte sich die Situation aber in nächster Zeit nicht bessern. Denn die Trump-Regierung stoppte alle Anreize, mit denen zuvor die Förderung und Nutzung von SAF verbunden war.

Air France vor Lufthansa

Lufthansa Group brachte es laut der IAG-Analyse auf rund 35.000 Tonnen und landet gemessen am absoluten Verbrauch damit auf dem weltweit sechsten Rang. Am Golf fiel nur Qatar Airways mit einer zweistelligen Menge auf. Rund 10.000 Tonnen waren es 2024.

A statement issued by the carrier said, “This milestone reflects the Air France-KLM Group’s commitment to accelerate the decarbonization of air transport.
This voluntary commitment is part of Air France-KLM’s “SAF Corporate” program, which facilitates the financing and purchase of SAF.
Fleet renewal progress The enlargement of the Airbus A220 fleet is part of a wider fleet renewal plan at Air France and is described as “a cornerstone of the Group’s transformation strategy.
“Our city was honored to be chosen for this new Airbus A220, a new-generation aircraft.","On August 25, 2025, Air France received its 46th Airbus A220-300 in Paris, following the aircraft’s delivery flight from Airbus’ Mirabel final assembly plant in Canada. The ferry flight marked a first for both the type and the airline, as the aircraft was delivered with a blend containing 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), certified directly by Airbus.

A statement issued by the carrier said, “This milestone reflects the Air France-KLM Group’s commitment to accelerate the decarbonization of air transport. This landmark flight not only confirms Airbus’ capability to provide Proofs of Sustainability (PoS) directly to customers and operators but also supports the industry’s commitment to decarbonisation. With PoS credits for a 50% SAF blend applied through the mass balance process, this ferry flight conducted by Air France’s 46th A220-300 named “Vaison-La-Romaine” (and registered F-HPNU) represented more than 25 tonnes reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to fossil fuels.”

Alongside performing the groundbreaking SAF flight, another joint initiative between the Group and the manufacturer is enabling Airbus employees to reduce the carbon footprint of their business travel by supporting the production of SAF. This voluntary commitment is part of Air France-KLM’s “SAF Corporate” program, which facilitates the financing and purchase of SAF. Since joining the program in November 2023, Airbus has cut its emissions by more than 2,000 tons of CO₂ through the purchase of over 670 tons of SAF.

Both the addition of more A220s plus the increasing use of SAF are ways in which Air-France-KLM Group is aiming to modernize the airlines’ respective fleets and to use more environmentally friendly measures to make flying greener in the future. SAF “plays a central role in reducing the carbon footprint of air transport, allowing at least a 65% reduction in CO₂ emissions over the full life cycle compared to conventional jet fuel. Air France-KLM is among the world’s top three SAF users and applies a strict sourcing policy, where only fuel that does not compete with human food supply, does not contribute to deforestation, and is not produced from palm oil is selected,” added the airline statement.

Fleet renewal progress

The enlargement of the Airbus A220 fleet is part of a wider fleet renewal plan at Air France and is described as “a cornerstone of the Group’s transformation strategy. With fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions reduced by 20% per seat-kilometer compared with previous-generation aircraft, the Airbus A220 embodies this ambition.”

Air France-KLM has nearly 200 new-generation aircraft (A220, A320neo, A321neo, A350, and Boeing 787) on firm order, and in 2024 alone, the Group took delivery of 41 new-generation aircraft across all its airlines. These major investments, which total more than €2 billion ($2.1 billion) per year, are said by the airline to be contributing to a fleet that, by 2030, will be composed of up to 80% new-generation aircraft. Air France’s first A220-300s, part of a total firm order of 60 aircraft, have been flying on its medium-haul network since October 2021.

What the parties say

“Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of the decarbonization of aviation,” said Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability, Air France-KLM. “Combining the two is only logical, and Air France-KLM is proud to participate in this Airbus milestone with the delivery flight of one of our A220s. Air France-KLM is among the world’s largest buyers of SAF. Directly receiving SAF at delivery is a game-changer, increasing transparency and driving industry progress.”

“Since the announcement of the first sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) delivery at Airbus site in Canada, enabling the Mirabel teams to use SAF for A220 production, customer acceptance, and test flights, this achievement solidifies Airbus’ commitment to using SAF for internal operations as well as customer ferry flights across all its commercial aircraft assembly sites and delivery centers worldwide.”

“In 2025 alone, we project cutting CO2 emissions by approximately 400 metric tonnes at our Mirabel site thanks to the 170,000 litres of pure SAF we will integrate to our activities,” said Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada.”And we’re pushing our ambition further with this ferry flight with PoS credits for 50% SAF – a significant step that comes just ahead of Air France’s 50th A220 delivery later this year. On a global scale, 78% of Airbus aircraft were delivered with SAF blend for the first half of the year, underscoring the importance our customers place on decarbonisation.”

A town celebrates the A220 naming

The naming of the newest aircraft to join the Air France fleet has brought some joy to the people of the town of Vaison-La-Romaine, located north of the city of Avignon in the region of Vaucluse. Even the mayor of the town has embraced the naming of the aircraft after his town and has posted on the town’s social media page to celebrate the occasion.

“Our city was honored to be chosen for this new Airbus A220, a new-generation aircraft. ‘Vaison-la-Romaine’ is now part of the Air France fleet alongside other cities such as Arras, Rivesaltes, and Colmar, and will fly around the world at an altitude of 10,000 meters. A dizzying figure!” said the post (in French).

Additionally, to celebrate the christening of F-HPNU, in partnership with the Vaison Ventoux Provence tourist office, the town will be marking the naming of the aircraft by unveiling a 1/100th scale model of the Airbus A220 in a few weeks in front of the fresco of the municipal gymnasium of the Ulysse Fabre sports complex located in the town itself.

From pioneering low-emission LNG infrastructure to delivering global megaprojects using modular construction and renewable-powered e-drive systems, Shaul explains how McDermott is addressing the energy trilemma: energy security, affordability, and sustainability.

How critical is the role of natural gas and LNG in supporting the energy transition and ensuring energy security?

Natural gas and LNG are absolutely essential to the global energy transition. While carbon-free energy production is the ultimate goal, natural gas plays a critical role in achieving interim decabonisation milestones, such as net-zero. That’s where LNG comes in. It is widely considered a bridge fuel that provides energy security and a reliable, lower-emission alternative to coal and oil, while bridging the gap as renewable and other carbon-free infrastructure continues to scale up.

At McDermott, we support this transition by delivering full project lifecycle services from concept to commissioning and fully integrated engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction (EPFC) solutions designed to reduce emissions and improve efficiency across the LNG value chain. For example:

Low-carbon LNG facilities: McDermott is pioneering the development of LNG plants with up to 95% reduction in operational emissions and 65% reduction in construction-related emissions.

Modular execution: Our modular fabrication approach optimises plot plan space, provides execution certainty and reduces the carbon footprint associated with traditional construction.

E-drive systems: By integrating electric drive systems powered by renewable energy, McDermott’s LNG solutions can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95% compared to gas turbine-driven LNG facilities.

Global reach and scalability: With strategically located fabrication yards and execution offices, we optimise delivery based on regional priorities, ensuring efficiency and sustainability.

Could you give us an overview of your project pipeline and recent milestones?

One of our key projects is the Woodfibre LNG facility in British Columbia, Canada, which is set to be among the world’s lowest-emission LNG plants. Using imported hydroelectric power, a renewable source, the project significantly reduces emissions and exemplifies our commitment to low-carbon delivery through modularisation and integrated project execution.

We are also nearing completion of the first LNG train at the Golden Pass LNG Export Project in Sabine Pass, Texas, with Trains 2 and 3 to follow. The project represents over 15 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of LNG capacity. Once complete, it will bring McDermott’s total large-scale LNG trains delivered on the US Gulf Coast to nine —the second most of any contractor. It demonstrates our ability to execute some of the world’s largest and most complex projects.

Beyond Woodfibre and Golden Pass, McDermott has a strong global LNG portfolio. At Freeport LNG, our team and its joint venture partners delivered three pre-treatment trains, a liquefaction facility with three trains, a second loading berth, and a 165,000 m3 full-containment LNG tank. Each LNG train at the Freeport LNG facility produces around 5.1 Mtpa of LNG and incorporates cutting-edge e-drive systems, including the world’s largest electric motor-driven refrigeration compressors—three 75 MW electric motors per train, which significantly improves North America’s energy export capabilities.

These e-drive systems offer significant benefits: reduced emissions, faster restarts, increased operating flexibility, and improved year-round efficiency.

What are the ways in which your company is powering a sustainable future?

McDermott is leveraging its global scale and breadth of capabilities to support decarbonisation across the energy industry. In addition to e-drive systems powered by renewable energy in LNG facilities, we are also focusing on other critical low-carbon focus areas including HVDC substations for offshore wind; low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia; carbon capture and utilisation; and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Currently, McDermott is delivering Europe’s first green steel project for Stegra in Boden, Sweden, and executing FEEDs (front-end engineering design) for Clean Hydrogen Work’s Ascension Clean Energy blue ammonia project in Louisiana and the Exploits Valley Renewable Energy Complex (EVREC) in Newfoundland.

What key messages do you want to highlight at Gastech 2025, and what are you planning to showcase at the show?

At Gastech 2025, McDermott will highlight our leadership in delivering sustainable LNG, hydrogen and ammonia solutions through advanced technologies and integrated project execution.

Outlook for Republic Services While Republic Services remains a market leader in the waste management industry, the current environment calls for careful monitoring.","Republic Services (NYSE: RSG) continues to capture investor attention as the waste management leader navigates uncertain market conditions. Recent stock analysis highlights a combination of strong fundamentals, high valuation concerns, and mixed technical indicators, leaving both institutional and retail investors divided on the company’s short-term prospects.

Investor Sentiment on Republic Services

According to the latest outlook, Republic Services finds itself in a technical neutral zone. While the company has reported steady earnings growth — including a 9.15% year-over-year rise in earnings per share and over 10% profit growth — analysts remain cautious. The stock’s price-to-earnings ratio, currently above 152, signals that the market is pricing in high expectations for future performance.

This high valuation raises concerns about whether Republic Services can sustain such momentum, especially in a volatile global economic landscape. Investors are increasingly adopting a “wait-and-see” strategy, monitoring whether the company can justify its premium valuation through consistent earnings and operational efficiency.

Fundamentals: Strengths and Weak Spots

From a fundamentals perspective, Republic Services shows mixed results. On the positive side, the company maintains a strong profit margin of over 31% and a quick ratio above 2.4, signaling healthy liquidity. Additionally, both institutional and retail investors have shown continued confidence, with inflows exceeding 50% across the board.

However, there are areas of concern. The company’s long-term debt-to-working-capital ratio stands at 7.06%, reflecting a higher level of financial risk. Its operating cycle of more than 40 days suggests challenges in efficiency when compared to leaner competitors. These factors, combined with the elevated valuation, add to the uncertainty around Republic Services’ immediate stock trajectory.

Technical Market Signals

Technical indicators for Republic Services present a similarly divided picture. Recent chart patterns, such as a Bearish Engulfing and a MACD Death Cross, point toward potential downside pressure. Yet, bullish signals like a Golden Cross and Marubozu White pattern suggest there may also be opportunities for upward reversals.

This tug-of-war between bearish and bullish signals reinforces the notion that Republic Services is in a transitional phase. Analysts caution investors to track upcoming earnings announcements and broader market developments before making aggressive moves.

Broader Market Factors

Beyond company-specific performance, global developments are also influencing sentiment around Republic Services. For instance, increased focus on sustainable aviation fuel and the renewable energy sector presents long-term opportunities for waste management leaders. At the same time, geopolitical instability and global economic slowdowns may weigh on demand for waste and recycling services in the short term.

The Asia-Pacific investment boom, highlighted by record-breaking ETF growth, underscores how global capital flows could indirectly benefit U.S. equities, including Republic Services. However, in the near term, volatility continues to dominate, requiring investors to carefully balance optimism with caution.

Outlook for Republic Services

While Republic Services remains a market leader in the waste management industry, the current environment calls for careful monitoring. Positive money flow from both retail and institutional investors shows trust in the company’s resilience. Yet, the combination of a high valuation and bearish technical signals suggests the stock may face challenges before breaking decisively in either direction.

For long-term investors, Republic Services remains an attractive option thanks to its solid earnings trajectory and industry stability. However, those seeking short-term gains may find the stock’s current volatility difficult to navigate.

Impact on the Future of Aviation The adoption of sustainable aviation fuel by South Korea represents a turning point for the global aviation industry.
Bottom Line South Korea’s move to incorporate Sustainable Aviation Fuel into all international flights by 2027 is a significant step in the right direction for the aviation industry.
The geopolitical ramifications of a radially altered global aviation industry, should sustainable aviation fuel technologies be successfully implemented, are massive.","South Korea is gearing up to make a major leap in the global aviation industry with a plan to blend sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into all international flights starting from 2027. This initiative aims to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector and align with global climate goals set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

As part of a broad effort to promote eco-friendly aviation practices, the South Korean government has proposed a mixture of SAF in all international flights, starting at 1% SAF blend by 2027. This move is seen as a step toward meeting the global aviation industry’s commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050.

Government Support for SAF Development

The government of South Korea is backing the transition to sustainable aviation fuels with financial incentives and tax breaks. These measures are designed to encourage local fuel producers to ramp up their SAF production capabilities. Additionally, the government plans to assist the oil refining industry by easing the financial burden of producing SAF.

SAF production in South Korea is believed to be production in South Korea is believed to be potentially transformative in a global context, and projections within the industry illustrate the global demand for SAF is set to exponentially increase from a mere 240,000 tonnes in 2022 to 18.35 million tonnes by 2030. Such a growth is attributed to the rising demand for more sustainable aviation.

Airlines Taking Early Steps Toward SAF Use

Several South Korean airlines are already on the path to incorporating sustainable aviation fuel into their operations. Major carriers such as Korean Air have committed to using a blend of SAF for international flights. The plan includes using SAF for one international route per week starting this year. This gradual integration is an important first step toward the broader goal of using SAF in all international flights by 2027.

The percentage of SAF used in these flights is low, but remains fundamental in addressing SAF’s availability in the future. Producers of aviation fuel have begun to assurance that these fuels will be readily available within a reasonable time frame.

Why SAF Matters for the Environment

Sustainable aviation fuel is considered a vital component in the fight against climate change. Traditional jet fuels contribute heavily to global carbon emissions. By using SAF, airlines can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as SAF is made from renewable sources such as plant oils, waste oils, and even carbon capture technology.

Experts claim that advanced SAF is one of the most advanced solutions for achieving carbon neutrality in aviation. With regards to conventional jet fuel, advanced SAF, if developed, would be able to reduce the lifecycle carbon emission of aviation fuel by as much as 80%.

Challenges in SAF Production and Cost

Despite its potential, the production of SAF faces some significant hurdles. Currently, the cost of producing SAF is much higher than that of traditional jet fuel. The South Korean government plans to address this issue by providing financial incentives and encouraging local production.

The oil refining industry also faces challenges in scaling up SAF production to meet the increasing demand. However, government support is expected to ease some of these burdens, allowing the industry to adapt to the growing demand for greener aviation fuel.

The Global Aviation Industry’s Carbon Neutrality Goal

The push for Sustainable Aviation Fuel is part of a larger international effort to reduce aviation’s environmental impact. The ICAO has set ambitious goals for the aviation industry, with a target of carbon neutrality by 2050. This means the industry must significantly cut its greenhouse gas emissions over the next few decades.

Having SAF included in South Korea’s international flights by 2027 is quite an advancement and aims towards the fulfillment of the international objectives. The adoption and patronage of the SAF assists in lowering the country’s emission from the aviation sector.

Collaboration Among Airlines and Fuel Producers

The collaboration between airlines and fuel producers will be crucial to the success of this initiative. South Korean airlines are working together to ensure a steady supply of SAF for international flights. The aviation industry, in partnership with government entities, aims to develop infrastructure for SAF production, storage, and distribution.

Actively engaging upon with relevant entities for a sustained period is believed to yield fruitful results in resolving challenges regarding the scaling up production of of SAF, thereby aiding the aviation industry in fulfilling its future sustainability objectives.

Impact on the Future of Aviation

The adoption of sustainable aviation fuel by South Korea represents a turning point for the global aviation industry. It signals a shift towards greener energy sources and a more sustainable future for air travel. The broader global adoption of SAF will likely follow, helping to pave the way for a carbon-neutral aviation industry.

If the positive trend continues among global airlines and oil companies regarding South Korea’s lead, the aviation industry will, in the near future, standardize the use of alternative fuels, thus boosting emission reduction and improving the sustainability of air transport.

Bottom Line

South Korea’s move to incorporate Sustainable Aviation Fuel into all international flights by 2027 is a significant step in the right direction for the aviation industry. This initiative aligns with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and meet climate goals. With government support, collaboration between airlines and fuel producers, and a growing demand for greener alternatives, the future of aviation looks brighter and more sustainable than ever.

The geopolitical ramifications of a radially altered global aviation industry, should sustainable aviation fuel technologies be successfully implemented, are massive. The example of South Korea could be instrumental for other countries attempting to decarbonize aviation, and provide them with insight fuel for a more sustainable model of aviation for the future.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/South-Korea-Introduces-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 06:56:31.350553

Tuy nhiên, giá nhiên liệu máy bay tại Mỹ vẫn chịu ảnh hưởng từ xu hướng giá toàn cầu.","Mùa cao điểm du lịch Hè 2025 đã chứng kiến một biến động quan trọng trên thị trường năng lượng.

Lượng nhiên liệu máy bay nhập khẩu từ châu Á vào châu Âu đạt mức kỷ lục, đồng thời tạo ra nhiều tác động đa chiều đối với giá nhiên liệu, nhu cầu đi lại và chiến lược năng lượng của Liên minh châu Âu (EU).

Theo Financial Times, dẫn nguồn từ công ty phân tích dữ liệu năng lượng Vortexa, chỉ riêng từ đầu tháng 8, gần 11,5 triệu thùng nhiên liệu máy bay đã được vận chuyển từ Trung Quốc và Hàn Quốc sang châu Âu.

Đây là con số kỷ lục, mặc dù thấp hơn một chút so với các mức cao nhất trong tháng 6 và 7, nhưng vẫn duy trì ở mức áp đảo trong lịch sử nhập khẩu.

Nhìn vào bức tranh toàn cảnh, xu hướng này không chỉ phản ánh sự dồi dào nguồn cung từ Viễn Đông, mà còn cho thấy nhu cầu hồi phục mạnh mẽ của thị trường châu Âu sau đại dịch.

Một nhà giao dịch nhiên liệu máy bay cấp cao nhận định: “Khối lượng xuất khẩu từ Trung Quốc và Hàn Quốc đang ở mức kỷ lục. Đây vừa là câu chuyện về nguồn cung, vừa là về nhu cầu.”

Bối cảnh thị trường nhiên liệu toàn cầu

Sau đại dịch COVID-19, ngành hàng không toàn cầu phục hồi nhanh chóng nhưng không đồng đều. Nhu cầu nhiên liệu máy bay tại châu Âu, Mỹ và châu Á đã quay trở lại mức trước đại dịch, nhưng các yếu tố địa chính trị, chiến tranh và lạm phát toàn cầu tạo ra những biến động đáng kể về giá nhiên liệu.

Mùa Hè 2022, giá nhiên liệu máy bay tăng lên gần 1.200 USD/tấn khi xung đột Nga - Ukraine làm gián đoạn chuỗi cung ứng năng lượng, đặc biệt là từ Nga, nhà cung cấp chính của dầu mỏ và nhiên liệu hàng không cho châu Âu.

Đến mùa Hè 2025, giá nhiên liệu bay tại châu Âu chỉ còn khoảng 700 USD/tấn, giảm gần 40% so với mức đỉnh, nhờ nguồn cung từ châu Á dồi dào và sự điều chỉnh sản lượng của OPEC+.

Theo Eurocontrol, số chuyến bay trong mùa Hè 2025 dự kiến tăng ít nhất 5% so với cùng kỳ năm 2024, phản ánh nhu cầu đi lại bằng hàng không trở lại mạnh mẽ.

Việc giá nhiên liệu giảm tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho các hãng hàng không châu Âu vận hành với chi phí thấp hơn, đồng thời khiến mục tiêu hạn chế bay nhằm giảm phát thải trở nên khó đạt hơn.

Lượng nhập khẩu kỷ lục từ châu Á

Dữ liệu của Vortexa cho thấy, chỉ riêng trong tháng 8, gần 11,5 triệu thùng nhiên liệu máy bay đã được chuyển từ châu Á sang châu Âu, chủ yếu từ Trung Quốc và Hàn Quốc.

Đây là lần đầu tiên khối lượng nhập khẩu từ Viễn Đông đạt mức kỷ lục trong lịch sử, cho thấy sức mạnh sản xuất và xuất khẩu của các nhà máy lọc dầu hiện đại tại châu Á.

“Khối lượng nhập khẩu từ Viễn Đông đang ở mức kỷ lục, nếu xét đến khối lượng giao dịch từ Trung Quốc và Hàn Quốc. Đây vừa là câu chuyện về nguồn cung, vừa là về nhu cầu”, một nhà giao dịch cấp cao nhận định.

Chuyên gia Amaar Khan của hãng định giá Argus cũng cho biết: “Các nhà máy lọc dầu Trung Quốc coi nhiên liệu máy bay là sản phẩm chiến lược. Nguồn cung năm nay thực sự rất dồi dào, giúp châu Âu đáp ứng nhu cầu hồi phục mạnh mẽ.”

Điều đáng chú ý là, nhiên liệu máy bay khác với xăng hay diesel vốn chịu tác động từ các giải pháp thay thế như xe điện hay LNG. Nhu cầu đối với nhiên liệu máy bay hầu như không giảm, giúp dòng chảy từ Viễn Đông duy trì ổn định ngay cả khi giá nhiên liệu biến động.

Tác động đến ngành hàng không châu Âu

Làn sóng nhập khẩu mạnh đã kéo giá nhiên liệu máy bay tại châu Âu giảm sâu, trở lại mức thấp nhất kể từ sau đại dịch COVID-19. Mức giá hiện tại, khoảng 700 USD/tấn, tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho các hãng hàng không vận hành và tăng số chuyến bay.

“

Nguồn cung toàn cầu hiện dư thừa. Đặc biệt, khi OPEC+ liên tục tăng sản lượng trong khi nhu cầu chưa phục hồi hoàn toàn ở Ấn Độ và Trung Quốc, giá nhiên liệu sẽ duy trì ổn định quanh mức hiện nay trong trung hạn.

Ông Michael O’Leary - Giám đốc điều hành Ryanair

Việc giá nhiên liệu giảm cũng có tác động tích cực đến chi phí vé máy bay, góp phần tăng khả năng tiếp cận đi lại bằng đường hàng không cho người dân châu Âu.

Tuy nhiên, điều này đồng thời làm dấy lên lo ngại về khó đạt các mục tiêu hạn chế phát thải trong ngành hàng không, đặc biệt trong bối cảnh Liên minh châu Âu thúc đẩy chính sách khí hậu xanh.

Một trong những hệ quả quan trọng của dòng nhiên liệu châu Á vào châu Âu là sự gia tăng phụ thuộc vào nguồn nhập khẩu. Nhiều nhà máy lọc dầu cũ tại châu Âu đang phải đóng cửa vì không thể cạnh tranh với các cơ sở hiện đại, chi phí thấp ở Viễn Đông.

Một nhà giao dịch bình luận: “Khi ngày càng nhiều nhà máy lọc dầu châu Âu đóng cửa hoặc bị loại khỏi thị trường bởi các cơ sở hiện đại hơn ở Viễn Đông, dòng dầu từ khu vực này vào châu Âu là điều tất yếu.”

Hiệp hội Vận tải Hàng không Quốc tế (IATA) cũng cảnh báo rằng, phụ thuộc quá mức vào nguồn nhập khẩu nhiên liệu sẽ làm EU đối mặt với rủi ro chiến lược nếu chuỗi cung ứng bị gián đoạn.

Ngoài ra, dòng chảy nhiên liệu kỷ lục còn phản ánh một nghịch lý rằng mặc dù EU nỗ lực giảm phát thải từ hàng không, giá nhiên liệu giảm lại khiến chi phí đi lại bằng máy bay dễ tiếp cận hơn, khó khăn trong việc hạn chế lượng bay thực tế. Đây là bài toán cân bằng giữa mục tiêu môi trường và phát triển kinh tế, du lịch.

So sánh với thị trường Mỹ và châu Á

So với châu Âu, thị trường Mỹ hiện có khả năng tự chủ về nhiên liệu cao hơn nhờ công suất lọc dầu lớn và cơ sở hạ tầng hiện đại. Tuy nhiên, giá nhiên liệu máy bay tại Mỹ vẫn chịu ảnh hưởng từ xu hướng giá toàn cầu.

Trong khi đó, các nước châu Á như Trung Quốc, Hàn Quốc và Singapore đang trở thành trung tâm sản xuất nhiên liệu hàng không xuất khẩu, nhờ các nhà máy lọc dầu thế hệ mới, chi phí thấp, và chiến lược tập trung vào sản phẩm chiến lược như Jet Fuel.

Trung Quốc đặc biệt nổi bật với tăng trưởng sản xuất nhiên liệu bền vững, tận dụng nhu cầu hồi phục của châu Âu và các chuyến bay nội địa. Hàn Quốc cũng duy trì dòng chảy ổn định sang châu Âu, củng cố vị thế trong chuỗi cung ứng toàn cầu.

Đây là minh chứng cho xu hướng dịch chuyển quyền lực năng lượng từ Tây sang Đông, khi châu Á trở thành điểm xuất khẩu chiến lược nhiên liệu hàng không.

Theo các chuyên gia, dòng chảy nhiên liệu kỷ lục từ châu Á sang châu Âu không chỉ là câu chuyện về cung cầu, mà còn phản ánh những thay đổi dài hạn trong cân bằng năng lượng toàn cầu.

Viễn Đông củng cố vai trò là nhà cung cấp nhiên liệu chiến lược toàn cầu, với nhà máy hiện đại, chi phí thấp và năng lực xuất khẩu lớn.

Châu Âu đối mặt với thách thức tự chủ năng lượng, phụ thuộc nhập khẩu ngày càng cao, đặc biệt khi các nhà máy lọc dầu cũ đóng cửa. Giá nhiên liệu giảm tạo thuận lợi cho ngành hàng không nhưng đồng thời làm khó khăn cho các mục tiêu giảm phát thải.

Các dự báo trung hạn cho thấy, nếu EU không nâng cấp cơ sở lọc dầu hoặc đa dạng hóa nguồn cung, nhập khẩu nhiên liệu từ Viễn Đông sẽ tiếp tục tăng, đặc biệt trong mùa cao điểm du lịch.

Ngược lại, các nhà sản xuất tại châu Á có thể tiếp tục củng cố vị thế chiến lược và mở rộng thị phần, nhờ dòng chảy nhập khẩu mạnh và nhu cầu toàn cầu ổn định.

Một nhà phân tích thị trường năng lượng nhận định: “Dòng chảy nhiên liệu này là minh chứng cho sự dịch chuyển quyền lực năng lượng toàn cầu. Châu Âu đang phụ thuộc vào Viễn Đông, trong khi Mỹ và châu Á duy trì lợi thế về sản xuất và xuất khẩu.”

Mùa Hè 2025 ghi nhận lượng nhiên liệu máy bay từ châu Á sang châu Âu lập kỷ lục, với gần 11,5 triệu thùng chỉ riêng trong tháng 8. Sự kiện này phản ánh nguồn cung dồi dào từ Viễn Đông, nhu cầu hồi phục tại châu Âu, đồng thời tạo ra những tác động đa chiều như giá nhiên liệu giảm, chi phí đi lại thấp hơn, nhưng thách thức về phụ thuộc nhập khẩu và khó đạt mục tiêu giảm phát thải vẫn hiện hữu.

Nhìn xa hơn, dòng chảy nhiên liệu kỷ lục là minh chứng cho xu hướng dịch chuyển quyền lực năng lượng toàn cầu.

Đó là việc Viễn Đông trở thành trung tâm cung cấp chiến lược, trong khi châu Âu phải cân nhắc các giải pháp nâng cấp lọc dầu và đa dạng hóa nguồn cung nếu muốn duy trì vị thế năng lượng bền vững.

With airlines eagerly waiting to welcome this next-generation widebody, the aircraft is now moving deeper into its certification journey.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has officially approved Boeing to begin Phase 2D of the Type Inspection Authorization (TIA), a milestone that focuses on community noise testing in Glasgow, Montana.

According to reports, this approval marks a significant moment for Boeing’s flagship program. So far, the 777X test fleet has already completed over 1,500 flights and nearly 4,200 flight hours, demonstrating steady progress in what has been one of the most closely monitored certification campaigns in modern aviation.

Phase 2D – Noise Testing in Focus

Phase 2D is dedicated to evaluating the aircraft’s noise levels, ensuring that the 777X meets strict global environmental standards while maintaining performance. This is a critical requirement before the aircraft can be cleared for widespread passenger service, as airlines and regulators alike are paying greater attention to community noise impact.

Phase 3 on the Horizon

Once Phase 2D concludes, the program will advance to TIA Phase 3, although no official start date has been announced yet. Phase 3 will be broader in scope, covering:

Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) performance and cooling under varied conditions

Aircraft stability and control, ensuring safe handling in all scenarios

Precipitation static (P-static) testing, verifying that systems remain protected from static build-up during adverse weather

Fifth Test Aircraft Joins the Fleet

To strengthen the program, Boeing has added a fifth test aircraft to its 777X fleet. Registered N2007L, the jet joined in early August and will primarily conduct High-Intensity Radiated Field (HIRF) trials, designed to measure system resilience against strong electromagnetic emissions.

Lufthansa to Be the First Operator

The first delivery of the Boeing 777X is planned for Lufthansa, which will become the launch customer once the aircraft is certified by both the FAA and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). With certification moving closer and testing phases gradually wrapping up, major airlines are looking forward to adding the 777X to their long-haul, high-capacity fleets.

A New Era for Long-Haul Aviation

For Boeing, the successful certification and entry into service of the 777X will not only mark a technological achievement but also reaffirm its dominance in the widebody market. The jet promises reduced emissions, quieter operations, and improved efficiency, setting new benchmarks for long-haul travel.",https://i0.wp.com/jetlinemarvel.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/B777x-outside.jpg?resize=960%2C600&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-01 02:56:43.906935

She now enjoys collecting the waste from her used cooking oil (UCO), knowing it can generate extra income instead of polluting the environment.

Many villagers in Tegalreja have adopted the same practice, selling their UCO to Beo Asri Waste Bank, which partners with Indonesia's state-owned oil company PT Pertamina to reprocess the waste into biofuel for aircraft.

Indonesia has for the first time successfully converted UCO into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marking a milestone in the country's waste management and alternative energy journey. Domestic carrier Pelita Air has already begun using the UCO-based biofuel on its Jakarta-Bali flights.

""Usually before, we would just throw it in the garbage or the nearby river, which polluted the environment. But now we can collect it and earn money from it,"" Sudarti told Xinhua in a recent phone interview. She said she can earn about 7,000 rupiahs (0.43 U.S. dollars) per kilogram of UCO, packed in bottles.

The collected UCO is absorbed by Pertamina Kilang Internasional (KPI) and processed at the RU IV Cilacap refinery. KPI Operations Director Didik Bahagia said on Friday that, for now, SAF production is limited to the Cilacap facility, but plants in Dumai, Riau province, and Balongan, West Java province, are targeted to join next year.

""We expect to process up to 38,566 kilolitres of UCO per year, with a production potential of 1,236,146 kilolitres. With that, we can meet domestic demand for SAF and even explore export opportunities,"" Bahagia said, adding that Indonesia is the first country in Southeast Asia to produce such fuel.

PT Pertamina's Vice President of Corporate Communication, Fadjar Djoko Santoso, said Tuesday that the company had established UCO collection points at 35 fuel stations in major cities, including Jakarta, Bandung and Surabaya.

""People who want to sell their UCO can come to the nearest collection point. The price is on average 5,000 to 5,500 rupiahs (0.30 to 0.33 dollars) per litre. So, please feel free to sell your UCO,"" Santoso said.

Turning everyday kitchen waste into biofuel not only cuts carbon emissions in aviation, one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, but also stimulates a domestic circular economy. It is part of Indonesia's broader strategy to green transport fuels and reach its net-zero emissions target.

Chairman of the Indonesian UCO Collectors Association for Renewable Energy, Matias Tumanggor, noted that Indonesia has significant UCO potential, while a study by Traction Energy Asia estimates that Indonesia could produce 2 million kilolitres of UCO annually, sourced from households, street vendors, restaurants, and the food industry.

Dadan Kusdiana, secretary general of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, said SAF made from UCO could reduce carbon emissions by up to 84 percent compared with fossil-based jet fuel.

He stressed that SAF is a breakthrough opportunity for aviation to reduce its carbon footprint without compromising safety or performance.

""Today's momentum confirms that Indonesia's clean energy transition is not just talk, but a series of practical steps, starting with harnessing bioenergy potential, integrating refinery technology, and public participation in supply. However, there remains work to be done, particularly in bioethanol development and strengthening inter-agency collaboration,"" Kusdiana said. ■",,N,,2025-09-01 00:56:31.150076

Koshikawa added: “Waste cooking oil is discarded along with food scraps, but it can be used effectively when it is separated.","In a significant step toward aviation decarbonization, major Japanese carriers are now being refueled with domestically produced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) using waste cooking oil.

A ceremony was held July 7 at Tokyo’s Haneda Airport to mark the official launch of the technology to achieve net zero emissions in aviation.

Shinichi Inoue, president of All Nippon Airways Co., told the gathering that SAF holds the key to achieving carbon neutrality, which means balancing emissions from human activities with those absorbed by forests and other sources.

Japan’s first SAF mass-production plant was completed at the site of Cosmo Oil Co.’s Sakai Refinery in Sakai, Osaka Prefecture, last December.

The plant started production in April to supply SAF to Kansai, Chubu and Haneda airports.

While the central government has set 2050 as its target year to achieve carbon neutrality, the aviation industry envisages having SAF account for 10 percent of the fuel it uses in 2030. The industry came up with the goal in 2022 under its basic policy to promote decarbonization based on the Aviation Law.

Because cooking oils derive from plants that had absorbed carbon dioxide as they grew, SAF is said to reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 80 percent when compared with conventional jet fuel.

The key issue is producing enough of the stuff to achieve clean energy in the aviation sector.

The Agency for Natural Resources and Energy said 1.72 million kiloliters of SAF will be needed annually to achieve the 10 percent figure.

But only 500,000 tons, or around 550,000 kiloliters, of used cooking oil is generated in Japan each year, according to the Japan Federation of UC Oil Business Cooperative Associations (UCO Japan), which organizes the collection of waste cooking oil for recycling as biofuel.

The bulk, around 400,000 tons, is reclaimed from food industry sources, including food plants and restaurants, and is subsequently used for livestock feed or exported. Ninety-five percent of it is used that way.

Attention is now focused on how to collect 90 percent of the remaining 100,000 tons produced in homes that literally goes to waste.

Itami city authorities in Hyogo Prefecture formalized a SAF partnership during a ceremony held at the city hall in June.

Since fiscal 1999, the municipality has collected residential waste oil, converting it into biodiesel for its sanitation vehicles and other purposes.

But now, all the material is repurposed into sustainable aviation fuel.

The Higashi-Murayama city government in western Tokyo struck a similar agreement in February to collect used cooking oil from homes.

These agreements were spearheaded by construction giant JGC Holdings Corp. under its “Fry to Fly Project” to achieve the goal of emissions-free aviation.

About 250 entities, including more than 30 municipal governments, are supporting the initiative.

“The key is to secure waste cooking oil,” said project head Yuki Nishimura.

Oil company Eneos Corp. had also reached agreements with 26 municipalities as of June to collect waste cooking oil from households.

The company is working on a project with trading house Mitsubishi Corp. to produce SAF at its Wakayama refinery in or after the business year that begins in April 2028.

“It takes time for people to learn about SAF. We are forging ahead with the project as part of an awareness campaign before the plant starts operations,” a representative said.

The number of municipalities collecting waste cooking oil started to increase after the Conference of Parties (COP3) in 1997 in Kyoto.

The Kyoto city government began recovering used cooking oil that year to convert it into biodiesel fuel.

Currently, it collects about 120,000 liters at 1,645 locations across the city every year to power 185 garbage trucks and 115 city buses.

Kyoto-based Revo International Inc., which has been working with the city government on the project, also produces SAF.

Japan’s first SAF production plant in Sakai is run by a limited liability company whose shareholders include JGC Holdings, Cosmo Oil and Revo International.

Tetsuya Koshikawa, CEO of Revo International, has been at the forefront of collecting waste cooking oil and producing biodiesel fuels for the past 30 years.

“Many people said it would be difficult for biofuel to stay relevant, which makes it so heartening to see it being used as a recyclable resource to provide aviation fuel,” he said.

Koshikawa added: “Waste cooking oil is discarded along with food scraps, but it can be used effectively when it is separated. It is a necessary resource for Japan.”",https://p.potaufeu.asahi.com/b2b4-p/picture/29957764/635a7c0d6a15767649ad0d30d96c3f11.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 23:56:21.729544

Countries worldwide have recognised the immense potential of biofuels in enhancing energy security, mitigating climate change, and stimulating economic growth.
To fully harness the potential benefits of biofuels, Pakistan must focus on developing a comprehensive, multistep framework tailored to the country's unique challenges and opportunities.","MELBOURNE:

Pakistan's economy is strongly anchored in agriculture, which accounts for nearly a quarter of its gross domestic product (GDP) and employs almost half of the country's workforce.

However, the sector also generates significant waste, raising environmental and sustainability concerns. The innovative strategy of harnessing this agricultural waste for biofuel production not only mitigates waste management concerns but also transforms two major challenges — environmental sustainability and costly energy dependence — into a single, impactful solution.

Biofuel is any fuel derived from organic sources, such as plant biomass, agricultural residues, or animal by-products. The production of biofuels generally relies on three distinct technological approaches: chemical, biological, and physical processes.

Biogas and bioethanol stand out as two of the most widely recognised biofuels, both produced through biological fermentation methods. However, a range of innovative biofuels is also emerging, including dimethyl ether (DME), sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), diesel, and butanol, which hold significant potential for advancing renewable energy solutions.

The evolution of biofuel technology is also notable, as it transitions from first generation, which primarily relied on food crops as feedstock, to second generation that utilises lignocellulosic feedstock, such as crop residues and other agricultural waste.

Even more advanced are third-generation biofuels, which leverage algae as a high-yield feedstock, marking a significant step forward in sustainable energy production.

Countries worldwide have recognised the immense potential of biofuels in enhancing energy security, mitigating climate change, and stimulating economic growth. Leading the way in integrating biofuels into their energy portfolios are Brazil and the United States.

For Pakistan, biofuel production offers a similar opportunity, serving as both a strategic step towards achieving energy independence and a crucial measure to address the environmental challenges associated with crop residue burning.

Pakistan has decades of experience in producing bioethanol and biogas, making them ideal starting points for expanding the country's biofuel capabilities. Initial efforts could focus on enhancing ethanol production by transitioning from first generation to second generation, and eventually to third generation.

Simultaneously, we could explore the development of valuable biofuels such as SAF, diesel, and gasoline through innovative pathways like the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) and alcohol-to-gasoline (ATG) technologies.

DME is emerging as a highly promising and versatile fuel known for its clean-burning properties. It is widely utilised as a substitute for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in domestic, industrial, and transportation applications.

DME can either be blended with LPG or used as a complete replacement, making it a flexible and adaptable option. China has been a global leader in adopting DME, while Indonesia has also made significant strides by gradually replacing LPG with DME, benefiting from its compatibility with the existing LPG infrastructure.

In Europe and North America, several initiatives are underway to produce and promote DME as a cleaner, more sustainable alternative for transportation fuels.

Recent advancements in technology have enabled the production of second-generation DME through a fermentative process in Australia. This breakthrough paves the way for large-scale production of this biofuel, positioning it as a sustainable option with potential on a par with second-generation bioethanol.

To fully harness the potential benefits of biofuels, Pakistan must focus on developing a comprehensive, multistep framework tailored to the country's unique challenges and opportunities. This approach begins with creating the initial roadmap, which lays the foundation for formulating a detailed policy plan.

The policy plan would then lead to the development of an actionable implementation strategy. The subsequent phase would involve establishing robust standards and regulations to ensure consistency, quality, and adherence to international practices.

Finally, the process culminates in the effective execution of these measures. This systematic and well-structured framework would position Pakistan to maximise the economic, environmental, and energy security benefits of biofuels.

The development of this framework would be guided by world-renowned experts and scientists specialising in both current and emerging biofuel technologies. By incorporating their insights, the strategy can emphasise a multipronged approach that addresses three essential priorities: support to attract foreign investment, fostering local industrial capacity, and a strong commitment to indigenous research and development (R&D).

To maximise the effectiveness of these three components, the government-led supporting initiatives need to be integrated into the framework right from the initial roadmap stage.

On the commercial front, these initiatives might include tax incentives, subsidies for biofuel production facilities, public-private partnerships, and the introduction of blending mandates across all fuel types. For instance, the government could enforce mandates requiring 10-20% biofuel blends in diesel, petrol, aviation fuel, and LPG, with a long-term vision of scaling these blends up to 50% and eventually transitioning to 100% renewable fuels.

Building robust indigenous R&D capabilities is essential for innovating cost-effective production methods tailored to the local feedstock. To achieve this, Pakistan could leverage its overseas diaspora of accomplished scientists by establishing connections with domestic universities and institutions to facilitate knowledge exchange and expertise development.

A key starting point would be the creation of one or more centres of excellence in biofuels. These centres could focus on identifying under-researched areas, where global competition remains limited, to accelerate the development of local expertise and intellectual property, positioning Pakistan ahead of international competitors.

The strategic integration of policy reform and advanced research initiatives is crucial for guiding Pakistan towards a sustainable and prosperous energy future. With a pragmatic, multipronged approach, the country has the potential not only to meet its domestic energy demand but also to emerge as a leading regional supplier of renewable fuels, thereby redefining its energy narrative for the decades to come.

By leveraging strategic partnerships, AI-driven innovation, and disciplined underwriting, IAG is not only navigating the challenges of a consolidating sector but also positioning itself to create enduring value. For investors, the question is whether these moves translate into a sustainable competitive advantage—or if they are merely tactical adjustments in a crowded market.

Strategic Partnerships: Anchoring Growth in Regional Markets

IAG’s alliances with the Royal Automobile Clubs of Queensland (RACQ) and Western Australia (RAC) exemplify its focus on regional expansion. These partnerships are projected to add $3 billion in gross written premiums (GWP) and boost insurance profit by at least $300 million, directly addressing the need for scale in fragmented markets [1]. By integrating RACQ and RAC’s customer bases, IAG is expanding its distribution network while reducing customer acquisition costs—a critical edge in a sector where margins are often razor-thin.

The strategic logic here is clear: regional players often possess localized expertise and customer trust, which national insurers struggle to replicate. By acquiring these regional assets, IAG is blending local knowledge with its own operational efficiency, a formula that mirrors broader industry trends. For instance, Marsh McLennan’s 2025 acquisition of Olympic Insurance Agency similarly aimed to leverage regional specialization in high-growth sectors like real estate and manufacturing [4]. IAG’s approach, however, is distinct in its emphasis on technology and data-driven underwriting, which we’ll explore next.

Technological Innovation: The AI-Driven Edge

IAG’s investment in artificial intelligence (AI) is a cornerstone of its strategy. AI-powered tools now resolve 70% of simple claims in real time, reducing costs by 30–50% and enhancing customer satisfaction [1]. This is not just about efficiency—it’s about redefining the customer experience in an industry historically plagued by slow claims processing and opaque pricing.

The company’s partnership with Canadian AI firm DAITY to develop risk analytics further underscores its commitment to innovation. By integrating AI into underwriting, IAG is able to refine pricing models, identify emerging risks (such as climate-related perils), and allocate capital more effectively [1]. This technological edge is particularly valuable in a consolidating sector where larger firms can outspend smaller competitors on data infrastructure.

Reinsurance and Risk Management: Stabilizing Earnings in a Volatile Environment

Natural perils—wildfires, floods, and cyclones—remain a wildcard for insurers. IAG has mitigated this risk through a $2.8 billion reinsurance deal with Berkshire Hathaway and an additional $650 million adverse cover from Enstar, capping annual natural peril costs at $1.283 billion [1]. This financial armor not only stabilizes earnings but also allows IAG to maintain aggressive underwriting margins, which rose to 17.5% in FY25 from 15.6% in FY24 [2].

The reinsurance strategy is a masterstroke in risk management. By transferring a portion of its exposure to reinsurers, IAG can focus on growth without sacrificing resilience. This is especially critical in a sector where climate change is driving up the frequency and severity of catastrophic events.

Consolidation and Competitive Positioning: A Sector in Flux

The insurance industry is undergoing a wave of consolidation, with large firms acquiring regional players to capture market share and expertise. For example, Arthur J. Gallagher’s $13.5 billion purchase of AssuredPartners and Marsh’s $7.75 billion acquisition of McGriff Insurance Services highlight the trend [4]. IAG’s own acquisitions of RACQ and RAC align with this pattern, but its emphasis on technology and ESG (e.g., investments in sustainable aviation fuel) differentiates it from peers [1].

This consolidation creates both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, it allows IAG to scale rapidly; on the other, it intensifies competition for talent, technology, and capital. However, IAG’s disciplined underwriting—prioritizing profitability over market share—and its ability to absorb costs through AI and reinsurance give it a structural advantage.

The Long-Term Outlook: A High-Conviction Play?

For IAG to succeed in the long term, it must continue to balance growth with prudence. Its FY25 results—$9.98 billion in net earned premiums and a projected $1.45–$1.65 billion in insurance profit for FY26 [3]—suggest it is on track. Yet, the company’s future will depend on its ability to adapt to macroeconomic shifts, such as rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions, which could strain underwriting models.

Investors should also monitor IAG’s ESG initiatives. As climate risks become more acute, insurers that integrate sustainability into their operations—whether through green investments or AI-driven risk modeling—will likely outperform peers. IAG’s dual focus on technology and ESG positions it well in this regard.

Conclusion

IAG’s strategic expansion in regional insurance markets is a compelling case study in long-term value creation. By combining partnerships, AI, and reinsurance, the company is building a moat that protects against both industry volatility and competitive pressures. In a consolidating sector, where the winners will be those who can scale efficiently while maintaining profitability, IAG’s playbook offers a blueprint for success.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-31 21:56:35.725730

Jaminan ini diberikan setelah dilakukan pemantauan langsung ke sejumlah titik distribusi energi vital, mulai dari terminal BBM, stasiun pengisian nelayan, hingga fasilitas aviasi.

Anggota Komite BPH Migas, Basuki Trikora Putra atau akrab disapa Tiko, menyampaikan bahwa kelancaran pasokan energi di Bali sangat penting, bukan hanya untuk mobilitas masyarakat, tetapi juga sebagai penopang pertumbuhan ekonomi daerah yang bergantung pada sektor pariwisata.

“Bali ini menjadi destinasi wisata internasional dan sudah mendunia. Karena itu, dukungan kebutuhan energi, baik BBM maupun aviasi, harus betul-betul tersedia dengan baik,” ujar Tiko usai meninjau Integrated Terminal (IT) Manggis, Karangasem, Kamis (28/8/2025).

Selain memastikan ketersediaan pasokan, BPH Migas juga menaruh perhatian besar pada sarana distribusi. Tiko menekankan pentingnya memastikan kondisi armada mobil tangki dan awaknya dalam keadaan prima.

“Kami mengecek operasional mobil tangki sebagai alat distribusi BBM kepada lembaga penyalur. Kondisi mobil dan awak mobil tangki harus dipastikan benar-benar baik agar distribusi tidak terganggu,” jelasnya.

Ia menambahkan, bagian penting dari rantai pasok adalah memastikan produk BBM sesuai dengan spesifikasi pemerintah. Hal ini menjadi tugas dan tanggung jawab BPH Migas untuk menjamin konsumen menerima BBM yang layak pakai.

Pemantauan juga dilakukan di SPBU Nelayan (SPBUN) Badung pada Jumat (29/8/2025). Fokusnya adalah penyaluran BBM subsidi dan kompensasi yang diberikan melalui mekanisme surat rekomendasi.

“Pihak penyalur harus lebih berhati-hati. Jangan sampai kuota BBM subsidi jatuh ke tangan konsumen yang tidak sesuai ketentuan. Bila ditemukan ketidaksesuaian surat rekomendasi, penyalur wajib melaporkannya ke dinas terkait,” tegas Tiko.

Selain sektor darat dan laut, BPH Migas turut memastikan pasokan BBM untuk sektor udara. Tinjauan dilakukan di Aviation Fuel Terminal (AFT) Ngurah Rai, Badung, yang memasok avtur bagi maskapai penerbangan di Bali.

“Kondisi pasokan dan penyaluran avtur di AFT Ngurah Rai sudah berjalan cukup baik. Yang penting, operasional di sini harus tetap kondusif agar penerbangan bagi masyarakat dan wisatawan tidak terganggu,” ungkap Tiko.

Dalam kunjungan itu, BPH Migas juga memonitor hasil uji coba Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), campuran avtur dengan 2,5 persen minyak jelantah (used cooking oil/UCO). Uji coba ini dilakukan oleh maskapai Pelita Air untuk penerbangan rute Jakarta–Bali.

“Kami mengapresiasi uji coba SAF ini. Ini pencapaian luar biasa yang dapat mendukung penggunaan energi berkelanjutan di bandara-bandara Indonesia,” tambahnya.

Pemantauan BPH Migas ini turut melibatkan sejumlah pihak, antara lain AFT Manager Ngurah Rai I Komang Susilo Gosa, Sales Area Manager Fuel Retail Bali Pertamina Patra Niaga Endo Eko Satryo, Sales Branch Manager Fuel I Bali Azam Akbar Hawariy, serta Sales Branch Manager Fuel III Bali Made Bilan.

The sky may still be the limit—but only if aviation fuel keeps pace with the world below.","IATA warns jet fuel supply at risk without urgent SAF scale-up

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has issued a stark warning in its May 2025 report, “Conventional Aviation Fuel and the Energy Transition: Refineries in Focus.” As the global energy sector moves decisively away from fossil fuels, traditional oil refineries are closing at a rapid pace—putting conventional aviation fuel (CAF) supply under mounting pressure.

While the energy transition is vital to climate goals, the IATA cautions that without coordinated action, the aviation sector may face a growing shortfall in jet fuel availability. The report argues that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is not only essential for decarbonisation, but also critical to mitigating fuel supply volatility caused by refinery closures and import dependencies.

A shifting demand landscape

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects oil demand for ground transport will peak by 2030, driven by electric vehicles (EVs) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Refineries, traditionally optimised for gasoline and diesel fuel, are economically unsustainable in a world of declining fossil fuel demand.

Unlike road transport, aviation lacks immediate alternatives. Jet fuel remains essential, as electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft are still decades from widespread use. Yet jet fuel makes up only 6–7% of refinery output. As demand for gasoline and diesel fuel weakens, refineries are rationalising or repurposing facilities, threatening jet fuel supply security.

Refinery rationalization and regional impacts

Japan illustrates the risks: government-imposed regulations and demographic shifts led to refinery closures, which later triggered aviation fuel shortages during the post-Covid-19 air travel recovery. The U.S. West Coast faces similar vulnerabilities, relying on imports from Asia due to limited pipeline infrastructure and Jones Act restrictions, which require goods shipped between U.S. ports to be transported on U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, and U.S.-crewed vessels. Europe is also at risk, with closures planned for key refineries like Grangemouth, UK, and Wesseling, Germany, in 2025.

Supply chain stress and price volatility

Longer, more complex supply chains heighten exposure to geopolitical disruptions. The Red Sea crisis and Panama Canal droughts have already caused delays and shipping cost spikes. In the U.S., regional jet fuel prices have become increasingly volatile. Without structural incentives, refineries are unlikely to boost jet fuel production, since it remains a marginal product compared to gasoline or diesel fuel.

SAF: A strategic buffer, not just a climate tool

SAF is typically viewed as a decarbonisation solution. Produced from waste oils, biomass, or synthetics, SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. But the IATA report argues that SAF also enhances supply resilience. With global SAF output under 0.2% of total jet fuel use in 2024, scaling production is urgent.

SAF pathways include bio-based (e.g., HEFA from used cooking oil) and power-to-liquid (PtL) synthetic fuels. Each faces barriers—feedstock limits, cost, and technology maturity. Yet SAF could be produced in retrofitted refineries or co-processed in existing facilities. IATA advocates policy support for these conversions and long-term investment in SAF infrastructure.

Europe’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates minimum SAF blending, while the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act offers production credits. But globally, SAF supply still lags far behind projected demand. To meet net-zero goals, production must scale to more than 400 billion litres by 2050.

Safeguarding aviation’s energy future

The report urges governments and industry stakeholders to treat SAF as essential to aviation’s energy security. Without SAF, the sector risks fuel shortages, supply bottlenecks, and cost spikes. Airports must upgrade infrastructure to support multiple fuel types, and airlines should diversify their sourcing strategies.

Increased SAF adoption can also cushion airlines from crude oil market swings. Long-term offtake agreements and regional SAF hubs could stabilise pricing, secure supply, and reduce carbon liabilities.

The IATA’s May 2025 report makes clear that the energy transition—if unmanaged—could destabilise global aviation fuel supply. SAF offers a path forward, addressing both emissions and resilience. Governments must incentivise SAF production, refineries must adapt, and airlines must invest in future-proofing their fuel strategy.

,,2025-08-31 21:27:50+00:00,The Business Times,Temasek's GenZero challenges idea that only carbon removal solutions matter,Janice Lim,,,,,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/esg/temaseks-genzero-challenges-idea-only-carbon-removal-solutions-matter,"[SINGAPORE] Temasek’s investment platform GenZero has pushed back against some segments of the sustainability community for their position that only carbon credits generated from carbon removal technologies are credible.
There have been calls by some that carbon removal projects – which involve actively taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and storing it – is more permanent, and therefore, more credible.
Carbon removals projects include direct air capture, which is currently limited in supply and very costly.
One example is its partnership with Chinese tech company Tencent to offtake at least one million carbon credits from GenZero’s investment portfolio over 15 years.
This includes companies that support the scaling of the carbon markets, such as carbon exchange Climate Impact X.","[SINGAPORE] Temasek’s investment platform GenZero has pushed back against some segments of the sustainability community for their position that only carbon credits generated from carbon removal technologies are credible.

The state investor’s decarbonisation-focused investment vehicle said that such “debates over whether one particular type of carbon credits counts and others do not are not productive”, in its latest sustainability report released on Monday (Sep 1).

While GenZero subscribes to the principle that carbon credits should be a means to tackle residual emissions and serves as a complement to the bigger priority of governments and corporates reducing their own emissions as much as possible, it does not mean that credits generated from non-removal projects or solutions are not a valid avenue.

According to GenZero, there is evidence that there are high-quality credits being generated from a range of projects, from nature-based ones to technological solutions, as well as projects that focus on emission reductions and removals.

“So we cannot discount and we cannot go upfront to say that only removals, or 10-day removals or durable removals matter,” said Anshari Rahman, director of policy and analytics at GenZero’s strategy and development group.

Speaking during a media briefing, he added: “You need to tackle the issue on a principles basis. If the issue is reversals or permanence, we should look at how standards and methodologies can... use the best available science and technology to improve monitoring, and address some of these pain points.”

There has been continued debate over the credibility of carbon credits generated from the reductions of emissions. Such projects include nature-based ones such as avoided deforestation, or technology-based ones like the use of sustainable aviation fuel in aircraft.

While such criticisms have been around since the formation of carbon markets, the debate resurfaced recently as various scandals challenging the integrity of various carbon reductions projects emerged. Criticisms that credits that have been generated and used do not represent actual emissions reductions have sent the prices of carbon credits and the trading volume plummeting over the last few years.

There have been calls by some that carbon removal projects – which involve actively taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and storing it – is more permanent, and therefore, more credible.

Carbon removals projects include direct air capture, which is currently limited in supply and very costly.

While work still needs to be done in improving regulatory framework – by national governments and international bodies – around this nascent industry, GenZero noted that there has been progress over the last few years in response to credit buyers pulling back on concerns over their integrity.

“We must not let the pursuit of perfection slow down climate action. Although carbon markets are still evolving, uncertainty should not justify paralysis,” said the report.

In light of the ongoing evolution of carbon markets, GenZero said that it has bolstered its risk management framework with enhanced due diligence measures including third-party audits and verifications conducted both pre and post- investment.

On the issue of integrity, GenZero chief executive officer Frederick Teo has confirmed that the investor no longer has a stake in the former C-Quest Capital – which has been rebranded to Bridge Carbon – after its former chief executive officer Kenneth Newcombe became embroiled in fraud charges over one of the cookstove programme it is running.

GenZero’s investment thesis

The carbon market downturn has led GenZero to adjust its investment process.

While it initially would invest in carbon projects in the belief that demand for credits will come once the supply is generated, the investor is now more proactive in securing buyers from the get-go, said Kimberly Tan, head of GenZero’s investment group. One example is its partnership with Chinese tech company Tencent to offtake at least one million carbon credits from GenZero’s investment portfolio over 15 years.

“The idea of some of those initiatives is... to understand what buyers want, to align upfront, and then to... invest in projects where we can be reasonably certain that there will be demand – in the form of a multi-year off-take that will give our project that base load of financial returns, or at least capital protection,” said Tan.

As for how the investor will continually make these adjustments in the current environment where climate action is potentially reduced due to policy actions by US President Donald Trump, Tan said that it will continue to look for investments that are “regulation-proof”.

“A lot of the climate tech innovation does happen in the US, and I think that will remain and probably will not change, regardless of the political environment. I think what we do have to take into account is then given the current existing exposure, how do we then very selectively add on,” she added.

GenZero said in its report that government and corporate pullbacks have contributed to a slowdown in climate investing.

It sees a real risk that governments managing tight fiscal budgets with multiple competing needs will choose to cut back on investments in climate.

With tariffs leading to cost increases and supply chain disruptions, companies will also be less willing to adopt fundamental decarbonisation technologies given the weaker appetite for capital expenditures.

They will also be less likely to embark on ambitious net-zero plans involving the use of carbon credits to address residual emissions, given the fear of greenwashing accusations.

Of the S$5 billion of startup capital that Temasek provided to GenZero since its inception in 2022, less than half has been deployed, although Teo declined to give an exact figure when asked by reporters.

Its capital is channelled into three main decarbonisation pillars: nature-based projects, technology-based ones, as well as carbon ecosystem enablers. This includes companies that support the scaling of the carbon markets, such as carbon exchange Climate Impact X.

While its funds are split relatively equally across all three pillars, Teo said, GenZero’s portfolio construction is a dynamic process.

The ability to scale and generate commercial returns, the potential for climate impact to be realised in the near term are some of the factors that the investor looks at when making its investment decisions. It does not have a set target on how much capital should go to each of the three pillars.

Climate impact

GenZero revealed in its inaugural sustainability report that it has set a target to achieve reductions or removals of at least seven million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) cumulatively by end-March 2028.

It has achieved direct climate impact of three million tCO2e as at Dec 31, 2024 cumulatively since 2024. This just takes into account its stake in its investee companies across its portfolio.

This number goes up to 12.9 million tCO2e when including indirect realised climate impact.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/5b4fc899a6a2753928f6a6bbf7fce53437571cc5aa783fd69d074ddde5f6327c?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-08-31 18:56:21.994357

But it is not widely used because supplies are limited, and its cost is three to five times that of regular aviation fuel.
Sustainable aviation fuel costs more, partly because of the logistical challenge of sourcing raw materials, said Malinen.
India, Thailand and Malaysia have announced 1 per cent targets by 2027, but further goals have not been confirmed.","[SINGAPORE] Governments must be more ambitious in mandating the use of sustainable aviation fuel to spur its producers to ramp up output, said Heikki Malinen, president and chief executive officer of green-fuel producer, Neste.

He said that Singapore’s targets, extending through 2030, set a good example – but global governments can go further, and shoot for higher, longer-term goals.

In 2026, Singapore will impose a levy on outbound flights, calculated based on a national target for sustainable aviation fuel to make up 1 per cent of all the fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026.

By 2030, this will rise to between 3 and 5 per cent.

In an interview with The Business Times, Malinen said: “We need a transitory solution between conventional jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuel, and that’s why we believe the mandate should be raised to about 10 per cent over the next five to seven years.”

Neste is listed on Nasdaq Helsinki, and is the world’s biggest producer of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

But without concrete signals about future demand, producers of this greener jet fuel cannot afford to gamble by ramping up capacity, Malinen said, as setting up production facilities takes years and requires major capital expenditure.

Singapore’s unique approach – with centralised procurement and a national target for sustainable aviation fuel based on volume – could thus be a “guiding light” for the region, he said.

Still on the ground

Sustainable fuel is viewed as the most viable way to decarbonise aviation at the moment; other options such as hydrogen and electric power are expected to be adopted only in the 2040s.

Unlike conventional jet fuel, sustainable aviation fuel comes from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, fat waste and non-food crops. It can cut carbon and greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 90 per cent.

But it is not widely used because supplies are limited, and its cost is three to five times that of regular aviation fuel.

Growth in the supply of this greener fuel remains “disappointingly slow”, said the International Air Transport Association. A million tonnes of it was produced in 2024, just 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production.

The high price is a barrier, and fuel accounts for as much as 30 per cent of an airline’s costs. Airlines already have thin profit margins – around 3 per cent in 2024 – and competition is fierce, with travellers being sensitive to ticket price increases.

Sustainable aviation fuel costs more, partly because of the logistical challenge of sourcing raw materials, said Malinen. Neste has around 600 vendors in 60 countries, and has set up networks to collect, for example, used cooking oil. It has long focused on using waste and residues, which others cannot easily use, to make this green fuel.

While supply is also affected by factors such as technology, mandates should increase production, he said. And as economies of scale grow, the price gap between conventional fuel and this greener fuel should narrow.

Mandates on the use of sustainable jet fuel are, however, gaining momentum: The European Union and the United Kingdom have led the way with binding targets of 6 per cent and 9.5 per cent, respectively, by 2030; at least another 17 nations have announced or are considering mandates or targets.

But most existing policies lack specifics and have a limited time-frame, said Malinen.

Australia has a non-binding goal of 10 per cent usage by 2030. India, Thailand and Malaysia have announced 1 per cent targets by 2027, but further goals have not been confirmed.

China, the world’s second-largest market for passenger aviation, announced the use of only 50,000 tonnes of this fuel by this year.

Malinen said: “What industrial companies like Neste would find very helpful is more visibility on the longer-term plans. If decisions are made on an annual basis, without a long-term perspective, how can a company take a massive bet for investing (in the production of this fuel)?”

He added: “If you want to have enough capacity for the early 2030s, you need to start making decisions now.”

This is because building the plants that produce this fuel is no small task. For instance, Neste began planning for its 2.5 billion euro (S$3.7 billion) Rotterdam facility in 2020. It will be completed only in 2027.

File a flight path

The lack of clarity is clouding investment decisions, said Malinen. “We’ve seen a number of companies now retract their investment plans, simply because no one really knows what happens next in the regulatory fight.”

The uncertainty also makes it harder to secure funding – a key reason for the failure of recent projects in sustainable aviation fuel.

In 2024, five such projects with a planned output of almost a million tonnes were cancelled. These included Oceania Biofuels’ project to build Australia’s first plant for this fuel; the project between Fulcrum Bioenergy and Solena in the US; and those by oil majors Shell and BP.

At least three projects in China have reportedly been postponed, and the lack of clear signals on the future of this greener fuel was cited as a reason.

But there are some bright spots, especially in the Asia-Pacific, said Malinen, citing Singapore, Thailand and Japan as the “frontrunners”.

Japan has the “most ambitious” long-term target in Asia – of 10 per cent sustainable aviation fuel by 2030; Thailand’s target is 1 per cent in 2026, gradually going up to 8 per cent by 2036.

Singapore’s target – 3 to 5 per cent by 2030 – is not as high, but Malinen noted that the country is seen as a “shining star”, adding: “My understanding is that what it does, others will follow eventually.

“So the decision Singapore takes on these mandates is extremely critical for the whole region,” he said, and expressed hope that the Republic would set higher targets.

Regardless, Singapore’s centralised approach is an efficient and transparent one that others should emulate, he said.

“If Singapore Airlines and Singapore take on the decision to use sustainable aviation fuel, then others will eventually have to follow, because they don’t want to be left behind.”

To date, the Singapore Airlines group has purchased 3,000 tonnes of this fuel from Neste’s Singapore refinery, in preparation for using it for 5 per cent of its total requirements by 2030.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/ccfc27461402233f42e10ce24fdba4db1f0e2dd45e7d2a43e91bf062b13f9015?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-08-31 17:56:22.696635

Setting a climate impact performance target puts GenZero among the first global investment entities to do so.
Mr Teo said GenZero’s climate impact target includes only emission reductions or removals that directly do so, such as nature restoration projects.
Cumulatively, the direct and indirect climate impact by GenZero amounts to 12.9 million tonnes as at Dec 31, 2024.
They may also face greater regulation that requires them to factor the price of their carbon emissions into their bottom lines.","SINGAPORE – Three million tonnes of planet-warming emissions have been directly reduced or removed from the atmosphere due to investments made by Singapore-based climate investment firm GenZero as at Dec 31, 2024.

In its inaugural sustainability report published on Sept 1, GenZero said it aims to contribute to at least seven million tonnes of direct emission reductions or removals through its investments by March 31, 2028 .

This is equivalent to about 10.9 per cent of Singapore’s emissions

projected for 2028

.

GenZero was set up by Singapore’s investment company Temasek in 2022 with an initial injection of about $5 billion.

Its focu s is on enabling a global trade in carbon credits by investing in nature and technology, as well as services to boost the credibility of carbon markets.

GenZero chief executive Frederick Teo declined to reveal the investment quantum utilised so far, saying only that “the majority of the firm’s initial funding has not been deployed”.

Setting a climate impact performance target puts GenZero among the first global investment entities to do so.

Other ways of measuring climate impact used by other firms include the size of investments in sustainability initiatives, size of nature areas restored, and species saved.

The report’s coordinator Sofia Galanek told the media at a briefing ahead of the report’s release that by setting the target, the firm hopes to hold itself to “a higher level of accountability” in a market where few set goals for the amount of emissions reduced or removed by their actual level of investment.

“We see a lot of net-zero targets, emission reduction targets, but not so much on the achievement of climate impact,” said Ms Galanek, GenZero’s senior associate of strategy and development.

“While the ecosystem is still on its journey to standardise climate impact measurement, we hope that by setting the target, we can contribute to the dialogue in this industry and demonstrate our achievements over time.”

GenZero’s climate impact target is also calculated based on its own stake in its investments.

Mr Teo said the firm chose 2028 as a near-term milestone, as the deadline provides “enough time to generate some climate impact from our early investments and instils early accountability for our impact performance”.

“The capital we have deployed will continue to generate climate benefits well beyond 2028,” he added. “Together with new investments in the coming years, we are laying the foundation for more ambitious long-term climate impact.”

The firm maintains a global portfolio of investments that are split across solutions that use nature to reduce emissions, decarbonisation technologies and levers that enable carbon markets to grow.

For instance, it has invested in Aurora Sustainable Lands, a firm that employs various ways of managing forests in the United States to maximise carbon dioxide absorption.

GenZero has backed CleanJoule, a firm that is commercialising technology to produce sustainable aviation fuel that can reduce aircraft emissions.

The investment firm has invested in related services that can boost the credibility of carbon projects, such as BeZero Carbon, a global carbon ratings agency that validates projects.

Mr Teo said GenZero’s climate impact target includes only emission reductions or removals that directly do so, such as nature restoration projects.

Investments that indirectly lead to climate impact, such as sustainable aviation fuel production, or those that contribute to a more favourable market for these technologies, are not factored into the target.

Mr Teo said such investments make nature and technology solutions investable, translating into direct impact in the long run.

“So without the enablers being in place, without investing into the development of a proper ecosystem, you cannot unlock the potential in nature and many other things.”

Responding to queries from the media, Mr Teo said it did not count carbon emissions from its carbon credit investment involving

US firm C-Quest Capital

, which had been embroiled in fraud charges.

Cumulatively, the direct and indirect climate impact by GenZero amounts to 12.9 million tonnes as at Dec 31, 2024.

GenZero also addressed questions on the outlook for carbon markets, given the ongoing trade tensions, economic uncertainty and faltering political support for climate action.

This follows a 2023 Guardian report that rubbished forest carbon offsets and claimed that about 90 per cent of rainforest credits were ineffective.

According to GenZero, climate technology financing dropped by 29 per cent, from US$79 billion (S$101.4 billion) between the f ourt h quarter of 2022 and the t hird qu arter of 2023, to US$56 billion in the following four quarters.

But there are tailwinds that could help lift the dampened outlook, according to GenZero’s director of policy and analytics Anshari Rahman.

He highlighted improved standards, as well as greater transparency and assurance in the quality of these credits, as being a silver lining for the market.

Moreover, many companies have set corporate net-zero targets. They may also face greater regulation that requires them to factor the price of their carbon emissions into their bottom lines.

One carbon credit represents one tonne of planet-warming emissions that is either prevented from being released or avoided. Emitters can buy these credits to offset their carbon footprint.

The carbon market can benefit countries that host carbon projects as it is a source of revenue for underfunded climate initiatives, such as forest conservation projects, that would not otherwise have been implemented.

South-east Asia has a lot of untapped potential for becoming a source of carbon credits, Mr Anshari added.

He said: “Carbon markets can be leveraged as an accelerator for decarbonisation in South-east Asia and the broader Asian region.”

Going forward, GenZero hopes to invest in more projects that have benefits that go beyond carbon, with biogas and agroforestry on its radar.

For example, biogas can contribute to energy security, while agroforestry has the potential to contribute economic opportunities that benefit local communities.

The firm’s managing director and head of investments Kimberly Tan said: “For instance, it may be sustainable cocoa production or sustainable coconut production where local communities benefit from carbon and increased productivities from what we’re doing.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e5bb8693669fe160021c5d4cf76707e0687486013944554ebb787e567f900d85,N,,2025-08-31 17:56:28.700852

The summit brought together over 500 experts from across the public and private sectors, ranging from energy executives to environmental advocates, to explore innovations in energy, climate resilience, and sustainable growth.

This year’s theme was the energy transition, highlighting the interconnectedness of supply chains, environmental policy, and the urgent need for decarbonization. These themes align directly with NYLCV’s advocacy efforts, especially our push for investments in clean energy and transportation electrification across New York State.

Much of the conversation focused on the potential for business to utilize innovation and investment opportunities to drive progress as well as profits, a mindset that NYLCV highly encourages. As a nonpartisan organization committed to clean air, clean water, renewable energy, and open space, we know that the energy transition isn’t just necessary, it is an opportunity to reshape our economy for the better.

Global Discourse, Local Action

The summit offered a unique opportunity for NYLCV to engage with leaders from both the public and private sectors. The event explored topics ranging from offshore wind and compressed air energy storage to clean transportation and carbon markets, many areas where New York has already taken bold action.

Panels on emerging tech, such as long-duration storage and sustainable aviation fuel, underscored the importance of innovation in scaling emission reduction efforts. A particularly notable presentation by Canadian green energy company Hydrostor detailed how compressed air can be used to store off-peak energy and reduce reliance on peaker plants during times of high demand. Another presentation from an energy storage company highlighted how large-scale battery facilities can alleviate blackouts, a timely concern as heatwaves become more frequent in NYC. These technology applications reflect the same principles NYLCV supports in advocating for grid modernization and resilience at the state level.

Also highlighted was the growing momentum around environmental justice and community-based adaptation. Organizations like CORE, in conjunction with speakers such as Chelsea Clinton, emphasized the need for proactive rather than reactive resilience planning. This is particularly vital in in vulnerable areas facing exceptionally high climate risks. NYLCV’s efforts to increase local investment in parks and green infrastructure echoes this focus on equitable climate solutions that benefit historically marginalized communities.

National Voices Encourage State Leadership

Though the scale of the summit was global, many of the issues hit close to home. From electrifying bus fleets to building smarter, more equitable cities, NYCV’s priorities were reflected in nearly every conversation, a reminder that state and local governments can lead when federal efforts lag.

Former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, now with Bloomberg Philanthropies, delivered a keynote speech stressing the role individual states have in achieving climate targets. She emphasized that even in the absence of \ federal leadership, climate champions like New York must continue to lead on clean energy, emissions reductions, and environmental protections.

NYLCV’s mission to evaluate, endorse, and elect environmentally focused candidates remains essential in advancing this vision. Our work bridges the gap between grassroots advocacy and policy implementation, ensuring that ambitious climate goals are backed by political will and public support.

A Broader Perspective on the Energy Transition

Topics ranged broadly, from smart grid technologies to circular manufacturing. Whether discussing regenerative agriculture or advanced recycling systems, the summit reinforced that climate solutions must be integrated, interdisciplinary, and scalable.

Some other key insights from the conference included:

Expanding possibilities for public-private partnerships in funding the transition, including models supported by green banks and philanthropic capital, even in the face of unfavorable economic forecasts.

The need to better align climate finance and long-term infrastructure planning, particularly in high-cost, high-risk sectors like storage, carbon capture, and electrification.

These initiatives are reshaping the company’s financial trajectory and positioning it for long-term viability in the premium private aviation market.

Cost-Cutting and Fleet Modernization: The Foundation of Financial Recovery

Wheels Up’s 2024-2025 strategic overhaul has yielded measurable results. For Q2 2025, the company reduced its net loss by 15% year-over-year to $82.3 million and narrowed its Adjusted EBITDA loss by 22% to $29.0 million [1]. These improvements stem from a $50 million annual cost-saving plan, driven by fleet simplification, overhead reductions, and operational streamlining [2]. The shift to premium aircraft like the Embraer Phenom 300 and Bombardier Challenger 300 has already transformed 17% of the fleet, with plans to add three more Challenger 300s in Q3 2025 [3]. This modernization not only enhances customer experience but also improves unit economics, as premium jets offer higher utilization rates and lower maintenance costs compared to older models [4].

The financial impact is evident: despite a 3% revenue decline in Q2 2025, Wheels Up’s Adjusted Contribution Margin rose by 4 percentage points to 12.2% year-over-year [5]. This margin expansion underscores the effectiveness of cost discipline in offsetting revenue headwinds, a critical step toward breakeven.

Delta Air Lines: A Catalyst for Growth and Stability

Delta Air Lines’ partnership has been instrumental in Wheels Up’s turnaround. Beyond financial backing—a $100 million undrawn revolving credit facility and $150 million term loan [6]—Delta has integrated its corporate sales force into Wheels Up’s operations. This collaboration has unlocked a 25% year-over-year surge in corporate membership fund sales, with corporate customers now accounting for 45% of Wheels Up’s membership fund mix in Q2 2025 [7]. Delta CEO Ed Bastian has emphasized that this synergy is central to Delta’s premium travel strategy, leveraging its 20 million SkyMiles members to create a direct pipeline for Wheels Up’s services [8].

Delta’s influence extends beyond sales. By incorporating Wheels Up into its loyalty program, Delta offers SkyMiles members one million miles for using the private jet service, effectively converting its high-net-worth customer base into a growth engine for Wheels Up [9]. Additionally, Delta’s access to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and fleet optimization expertise has helped Wheels Up align with ESG trends, a growing differentiator in the premium travel sector [10].

Integrated Corporate Sales: A New Revenue Engine

The integration of Delta’s corporate sales team has been a game-changer. Wheels Up CEO George Mattson noted that corporate sales are “outpacing expectations,” with the channel now representing the fastest-growing segment of membership fund sales [11]. This success is attributed to Delta’s ability to cross-sell Wheels Up to its corporate clients, who value the flexibility and prestige of private aviation. The hybrid model—allowing Delta One passengers to extend their itineraries with Wheels Up private jet legs—has further broadened the customer base, appealing to high-income professionals and HNWIs [12].

Risks and the Road to Profitability

While progress is clear, challenges remain. The private aviation market is highly competitive, and converting corporate sales into long-term profitability will require sustained execution. However, Wheels Up’s 2026 timeline for full cost-cutting results and fleet modernization completion offers a clear path to breakeven [13]. With the $500 million credit facility from Delta and other investors providing financial stability, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the $40 billion private aviation market, which is growing at 12% annually [14].

Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on Premium Travel’s Future

Wheels Up’s strategic turnaround—anchored by cost discipline, fleet modernization, and Delta’s ecosystem—has laid a robust foundation for long-term growth. The combination of improved margins, diversified revenue streams, and a scalable partnership model suggests that UP could emerge as a key player in the premium travel sector. For investors, the question is no longer whether Wheels Up can survive, but how effectively it can leverage its current momentum to dominate a market in flux.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-31 15:56:31.284934

In an exclusive conversation with BioSpectrum Asia, Christopher Ong, Managing Director of DHL Express Singapore, shares how DHL’s latest investments — including a new €10 million pharmaceutical hub — are strengthening Singapore’s position as a strategic life sciences and healthcare logistics hub for the Asia Pacific region

How is DHL contributing to Singapore’s role as a strategic hub for the life sciences and healthcare industry in the Asia Pacific region?

At DHL, we align closely with Singapore's strategic vision to position itself as a leading global hub for life sciences and healthcare (LSHC). Singapore’s robust infrastructure, strong regulatory framework, and prime geographic location has become an attractive spot for multi-nationals and upcoming researchers to establish their presence in Singapore, especially in dedicated estates such as Tuas Biomedical Park and Biopolis. As Singapore’s biomedical sector continues to thrive, manufacturing products valued at nearly S$38 billion (estimated €25.4 billion) for global markets (JTC, 2025), DHL is committed to supporting this growth by providing tailored logistics solutions that meet the evolving needs of the life sciences and healthcare sector.

To do this, we recently launched our €10 million pharmaceutical hub in Singapore to enhance our capabilities and drive innovation in this space. At 8,200 square meters, the new pharma hub brings our total warehouse space in Singapore for dedicated LSHC operations to over 36,000 square meters. This is a major step for us in offering a full, comprehensive suite of solutions for the LSHC industry in cold-chain warehousing, pharmaceutical finished goods, and clinical trials.

The DHL Express global network also connects more than 220 countries and territories globally, with 3 global hubs, 19 regional hubs, and close to 300 aircrafts. In 2024, we upgraded our South Asia Hub (SAH) located by Singapore Changi Airport, further enhancing our global connectivity and boosting our operational capacity on the ground. SAH was established in 2016 to serve as a key logistics hub connecting Singapore to the rest of the world. Today, the hub is also home to five DHL-owned Boeing 777 freighters that optimise transit times between the Americas and Asia. We are equally well-equipped to serve Europe. Our Europe to Asia connection, operated by cargo airline AeroLogic since 2009, remains strong. A joint venture between DHL Express and Lufthansa Cargo, our AeroLogic network mainly serves routes between Europe and Asian destinations from Monday to Fridays, strengthening our service offerings to customers.

Our strong global aviation and ground network and ongoing investments are critical in building our life sciences and healthcare infrastructure and logistics capabilities to support Singapore’s role as a leading global life sciences and healthcare hub.

What does DHL's recent investment in a new pharmaceutical hub in Singapore entail?

Our new pharmaceutical hub in Singapore marks a significant enhancement of DHL’s healthcare logistics capabilities. The hub features specialized temperature-controlled zones, including ambient (15°C to 25°C) and cold room (2°C to 8°C) that ensures precise storage conditions for sensitive healthcare products. It is also Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant and features advanced cold chain infrastructure like airtight loading docks and dedicated anterooms. This is critical in ensuring uninterrupted temperature stability throughout the logistics process.

Located near the Tuas Bio-Medical Park, DHL’s new pharma hub also offers seamless connectivity to Changi Airport and Tuas Mega Port, enabling efficient regional and global distribution for our pharmaceutical partners.

Our vision does not stop here. We are already looking at introducing pharma-related value-added services such redressing activities within this facility. Regional partners can expect more development in the Asia Pacific, especially with DHL’s commitment to invest €500 million into healthcare logistics in Asia Pacific by 2030 to meet the increasing demands and complexities of the market.

How DHL addressing the needs of medical device companies operating in Singapore?

We are focused on deploying specialized logistics solutions tailored for the medical device sector. The export landscape for medical devices is complex and navigating it requires a comprehensive understanding of local regulations to ensure compliance and market access. Our shipping solution, DHL Worldwide Medical Express, or WMX caters specifically to this sector. This solution is designed to help companies navigate the complexities of shipping life-saving medical components internationally and is particularly beneficial for urgent deliveries of time and temperature-sensitive shipments.

Other offerings in the pipeline include dedicated warehousing options for seamless transits, customised transportation options for timely deliveries, advanced tracking systems that provide real-time visibility throughout the logistics process and meet UN 3373 and IATA Dangerous Goods standards.

In addition, we have DHL Certified Life Science Healthcare Specialists that are always ready to help our customers maintain adherence to the regulatory framework governing medical devices by providing guidance to navigate product classifications and compliance requirements across countries. Customers can also opt for shipment insurance that protect their shipments in transit too.

The number of clinical trials in Singapore has been relatively steady the past decade. How can DHL provide value to this segment?

We understand the multi-faceted logistical challenges surrounding clinical trials and take great care in offering comprehensive logistics services tailored for these trials to facilitate a smoother clinical trial workflow and value-add to the drug development process. In Singapore, this is done through temperature-controlled transportation and customized supply chain solutions that guarantee the timely delivery of clinical trial materials, be it investigational drugs, investigational medicinal products, or biological samples. Our services include real-time tracking and monitoring to ensure that all shipments are handled with the utmost care and precision.

WMX shipments receive top priority within our DHL network, with pickups by our couriers as late as possible in the day and deliveries at the earliest available service. Within Asia Pacific, our WMX solution prioritises temperature-controlled, time-critical shipments from over 20,000 clinical sites. Customers can also leverage DHL’s robust and extensive network across the Asia Pacific region to deliver their shipments from main metropolitan cities into Singapore within the next working day. A Saturday delivery option is also available upon request.

Can you elaborate on DHL’s cold chain facilities in Singapore and their importance for temperature-sensitive shipments?

Our cold chain facilities, including the newly opened pharmaceutical hub, are vital for maintaining the integrity of temperature-sensitive medical shipments. Equipped with cutting-edge monitoring technologies, these facilities ensure optimal temperature control throughout the handling process during shipping. By using our WMX service, customers can choose from ambient (room temperature), controlled-ambient (15°C to 25°C), refrigerated (2°C to 8°C), frozen with dry ice (-80°C), frozen (-15°C to -25°C), and ultra-deep frozen (below -180°C) options when shipping their active pharmaceutical ingredients. Contingency activation services like dry ice replenishment and access to refrigerated facilities are also available.

Just this year, our expertise in cold chain management was further strengthened by DHL’s acquisition of Cryoport’s CRYOPDP. CRYOPDP specializes in providing white-glove courier services. This strategic partnership with Cryoport integrates DHL's global health logistics capabilities with Cryoport's industry-leading expertise, giving us an edge in the provision of specialised solutions in a fast-growing life sciences and healthcare market segment.

Besides ensuring optimal temperature control, time is of essence when transporting temperature-sensitive shipments. Coupled with priority pickup and delivery services, our in-house customs team is experienced in clearing priority shipments to maximise efficacy for our customers.

How does DHL balance high-compliance healthcare logistics with its decarbonisation targets in Singapore?

As the healthcare sector in Singapore increasingly prioritises sustainability (Healthcare Asia, 2024), we recognize our role in supporting these efforts. Our investments are aimed at creating a more sustainable supply chain that not only meets international compliance standards but also addresses the environmental impact of healthcare logistics.

At DHL, we started our sustainability journey in 2009 to drive carbon efficiency, and in 2017, we were the first company in the transport and logistics sector to set a 2050 net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target. Last year, we strengthened our commitment by introducing a 4th bottom line to our new DHL Group Strategy 2030 - Green Logistics of Choice (on top of Employer of Choice, Provider of Choice, Investment of Choice).

We have been using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as a lever in our emission reduction targets for air transportation since 2021. Most recently in July 2025, we signed a deal with Neste to supply 9.5 million litres of SAF from Singapore Changi Airport, one of the largest deals by volume in the air cargo sector in Asia. DHL customers can also opt in for GoGreen Plus and choose a desired proportion of SAF to be used in their international shipments through a “book and claim” system that targets their Scope 3 emissions through carbon insetting.

We have also been converting our ground fleet to electric vehicles (EVs) for last mile pickup and deliveries since 2022. Today, at the Express team, we are the proud operator of over 100 EVs, the largest fleet of commercial EV vans in Singapore.

As the managing director of DHL Express Singapore, what do you think sets DHL apart from other service providers?

I strongly believe that our people bring about growth and quality. Each DHL Express employee goes through a Certified Internal Specialists (CIS) programme that imparts values, and technical and soft skills. It is not by chance that we have been certified by global people analytics and consulting firm Great Place to Work® Institute as the Number 1 Great Place to Work in Singapore for 5 consecutive years, since 2020.

The culture of building a great workplace for all motivates employee to bring about great service quality for customers which eventually lead to customer loyalty, ultimately driving profitability that allows us to reinvest into our business to strengthen our infrastructure and capabilities.

With regards to our life sciences and healthcare segment, we build a culture around what is inside the box – a crucial shipment that can help save lives. This culture permeates throughout our entire logistical chain, where everyone works towards the same vision – to ensure that your time and temperature-sensitive shipments gets delivered to its destination on time.

Finally, how does DHL ensure pandemic resilience in its logistics operations?

The agility to respond to a global pandemic is not built overnight. Over time, DHL has established a robust framework to bolster resilience within our network and operations. In 2020, our capabilities were put to the test during the COVID-19 pandemic when we had to ensure the effective distribution of vaccines efficiently. Despite the lockdown, we did not close for a single day during the pandemic, and we were able to deliver the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines (and eventually over 11 million doses) successfully to Singapore, showcasing our ability to navigate even the most complex logistics challenges flexibly and reliably. As a group, DHL delivered over 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to over 160 countries in total.

COVID-19 will not be the last global pandemic. Our extensive global transportation networks and substantial local presence, coupled with our rapidly growing cold chain capabilities and scalable supply chain - and a proven track record in crisis response shows we are prepared for future health events and can be trusted to handle the logistical needs of the healthcare industry.

Transportation is a critical part of any health crisis, and we, at DHL, are in the business of supporting the healthcare system through the work we do, which is reflected in our mission – Excellence. Simply Delivered.

Hawaiian Airlines recently unveiled the forthcoming application of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on designated routes between Osaka, Japan, and Honolulu, Hawai. This undertaking, conducted in partnership with Alaska Airlines and Cosmo Oil Marketing Co., is designed to achieve meaningful reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and to advance the promotion of sustainable tourism within the Asia-Pacific corridor. By pioneering the deployment of SAF on international Asia–Pacific services, the carrier seeks to combine a rigorous response to the rising global demand for travel with a measurable commitment to minimising the environmental impacts of its operations.

This step not only aligns with the airline’s sustainability goals but also strengthens tourism between Japan and Hawaii, a region known for its pristine beaches and vibrant culture. Passengers on flights between Kansai International Airport in Osaka and Honolulu will be among the first to experience the benefits of SAF, which can cut life-cycle carbon emissions by up to eighty percent compared to traditional jet fuel.

A Game-Changer for Eco-Tourism

Hawaii’s tourism industry is one of its key economic pillars, with over ten million visitors arriving annually. The introduction of SAF on flights between Japan and Hawaii is poised to enhance the appeal of both destinations, offering an eco-friendly travel option for sustainability-conscious travellers. Tourists can now travel with peace of mind, knowing their flight contributes to reducing global carbon emissions.

The collaboration marks a significant leap towards greener aviation and could become a model for other airlines operating in the Asia-Pacific region. Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint considerably, helping to make tourism more sustainable for future generations.

Cosmo Energy Group’s Role in SAF Production

Cosmo Energy Holdings, a key partner in this initiative, is leading the charge in Japan’s sustainable fuel production. Through a subsidy from Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organisation (NEDO), Cosmo has developed a supply chain for SAF production, using domestically sourced used cooking oil. The partnership with Hawaiian Airlines allows for the first commercialisation of locally produced SAF in Japan, marking a historic milestone in the country’s push for more sustainable fuel options.

This collaboration not only addresses the aviation sector’s carbon emissions but also promotes local sourcing of materials, further enhancing the environmental benefits of this initiative. As Japan strives to meet its 2050 net-zero carbon emission target, this move demonstrates the country’s commitment to developing sustainable energy solutions and reducing environmental impact.

Promoting Sustainable Travel Between Osaka and Honolulu

As the travel industry increasingly focuses on environmental responsibility, the introduction of SAF will be a key factor in drawing eco-conscious tourists to Hawaii. The initiative enhances the appeal of Honolulu and Osaka as eco-tourism destinations. Hawaii is known for its unique ecosystems, while Japan’s cultural heritage and scenic landscapes continue to attract millions of visitors each year. This partnership highlights both regions’ dedication to balancing tourism with environmental sustainability.

In addition, the use of SAF supports the broader sustainability goals of both Hawaiian Airlines and its parent company, Alaska Airlines. The airlines have ambitious plans to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, and this move is a significant step toward reaching that target. Through investments in cleaner technology and sustainable fuel sources, the airlines aim to reduce their overall environmental impact.

A Shared Vision for a Greener Future

Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines, both long-established in the aviation industry, are now at the forefront of sustainability efforts. The airlines’ commitment to SAF, alongside other innovations in technology and fleet modernisation, aligns with their goal of making air travel more environmentally friendly.

The expansion of the SAF programme is part of a wider trend in the aviation industry to address climate change and promote sustainable tourism. This initiative provides a valuable opportunity for visitors to enjoy the beauty of Hawaii and Japan while supporting eco-friendly practices.

The Future of Travel: How SAF Benefits the Tourism Industry

The introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on the Osaka–Honolulu route marks a significant advancement in the advancement of responsible tourism. As conscious travel becomes a central concern for increasing numbers of international visitors, this initiative serves as a prototype for expanding low-environmental-impact flight possibilities. When regarded alongside the rising consumer preference for eco-oriented journeys, the carbon-offset advantages derived from the use of SAF may in due course recalibrate the strategy for managing long-haul aviation.

Passengers flying the Osaka–Honolulu leg can take in Hawaii’s world-renowned shoreline, rich cultural heritage, and varied outdoor pursuits while knowing that their travel-related greenhouse-gas discharge has been markedly diminished. The gesture goes beyond compliance and underscores the obligation of the hospitality industry to sustainable governance, thereby preserving for subsequent generations the allure of both the Japanese archipelago and the Hawaiian Islands.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Airlines-1-3.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 17:56:39.094354

Der Überführungsflug war eine Premiere: Das Flugzeug wurde mit einer Mischung aus 50 Prozent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) ausgeliefert, die direkt von Airbus zertifiziert wurde. Dieser Fortschritt zeugt vom Engagement von Air France-KLM, die Dekarbonisierung des Luftverkehrs voranzutreiben.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) spielt eine zentrale Rolle bei der Reduzierung des CO₂-Fußabdrucks des Luftverkehrs. Es ermöglicht eine Verringerung der CO₂-Emissionen über ihren gesamten Lebenszyklus hinweg um mindestens 65 Prozent im Vergleich zu herkömmlichem Kerosin.

Air France-KLM gehört zu den drei weltweit führenden Anwendern von SAF und verfolgt eine strenge Beschaffungspolitik: Es werden nur nachhaltige Kraftstoffe ausgewählt, die nicht in Konkurrenz zur menschlichen Nahrungsmittelversorgungstehen, nicht zur Abholzung von Wäldern beitragen und nicht aus Palmöl hergestellt werden.

Eine weitere gemeinsame Initiative der Gruppe und des Herstellers: Air France-KLM und Airbus haben eine Vereinbarung geschlossen, die es den Mitarbeitenden von Airbus ermöglicht, den CO₂-Fußabdruck ihrer Geschäftsreisen zu reduzieren, indem sie die SAF-Produktion unterstützen. Diese freiwillige Verpflichtung ist Teil des „SAF Corporate“-Programms von Air France-KLM, das die Finanzierung und den Kauf von SAF ermöglicht. Seit seinem Beitritt zum SAF-Programm im November 2023 hat Airbus durch den Kauf von mehr als 670 Tonnen SAF die CO2-Emissionen um mehr als 2.000 Tonnen reduziert.

Die Erneuerung der Flotte ist ein zentraler Bestandteil der Transformationsstrategie der Air France-KLM-Gruppe. Mit einem um 20 Prozent geringeren Treibstoffverbrauch und CO₂-Ausstoß pro Passagierkilometer im Vergleich zu Flugzeugen der vorherigen Generation verkörpert der Airbus A220 dieses Ziel.

Air France-KLM hat fast 200 Flugzeuge der neuen Generation (Airbus A220, A320neo, A321neo, A350 und Boeing 787) fest bestellt, und allein im vergangenen Jahr 41 Flugzeuge der neuen Generation für alle ihre Fluggesellschaften in Empfang genommen.

Diese strukturellen Investitionen – in Höhe von mehr als zwei Milliarden Euro pro Jahr – tragen dazu bei, dass bis 2030 bis zu 80 Prozent der Flotte der Air France-KLM-Gruppe aus Flugzeugen der neuen Generation bestehen werden.

A similar idea was explored at Northwestern University to draw nearly limitless energy from the soil using microbial fuel cells.
While the power output is relatively small, it shows how unexpected bio-resources can help real communities meet basic energy needs.
Many of these technologies struggle with high implementation costs, limited infrastructure, and skepticism from policymakers that favor established fuel sources.","In a world dominated by talk of solar panels, wind turbines, and nuclear reactors, some of the most fascinating breakthroughs in energy are happening in unexpected places. Scientists are experimenting with everything from using moisture to break down plastic into usable recycled material, to turning seawater into hydrogen, and even converting banana peels into biogas.

The future of energy isn't just about creativity, it's also about accessibility. A clean technology only matters if it's affordable enough to be adopted widely. That's why researchers are increasingly looking at low-cost, everyday materials that most of us see as waste. Imagine if the dredges of your morning coffee or the leftovers from a winery could one day fuel cars, buses, or even planes.

What once seemed useless might just be the key to fueling the world. So, let's take a look at 10 unexpected energy sources you probably never imagined could be turned into fuel.

Your daily caffeine fix might do more than help you live longer — it could literally power the bus you take to work. It sounds unbelievable, but researchers have discovered that used coffee grounds contain oils suitable for biodiesel production. A London-based startup called Bio-Bean, has already partnered with transport authorities to turn discarded coffee grounds into biofuel for buses.

The process is simple but brilliant. The grounds are collected from coffee shops, processed to extract oil, and converted into biodiesel. Remarkably, this new fuel works seamlessly in existing diesel engines, so there's no need for costly modifications. This approach is not only efficient, it's also eco-friendly because it reduces waste, lowers emissions and reduces the need for fossil fuels.

Billions of cups of coffee are consumed globally each year, producing massive amounts of waste. If even a fraction of that waste were redirected into fuel, the environmental impact would be enormous.

Seawater, which covers more than 70% of our planet, could become a major source of clean energy. At the University of Adelaide, scientists have developed a method to turn seawater into green hydrogen fuel, without the costly removal of the salt content. Traditional electrolysis (splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen) usually requires purified water because salt corrodes the electrodes. By using a specialized non-precious catalyst, the team bypassed this problem.

The benefits are huge. Green hydrogen is a clean fuel, and producing it directly from seawater lowers costs and energy use. Beyond the lab, companies like Equatic are scaling this idea further, with a process that not only extracts hydrogen fuel but also forces seawater to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, locking it away as stable minerals. This means the ocean doubles as both a carbon sink and a fuel factory.

While large-scale adoption is still in progress, this discovery could completely transform energy production, offering a pathway to clean fuel and climate action at the same time.

It sounds like a science fair prank, but urine can actually generate electricity. Researchers at the University of Bath have developed miniature fuel cells that harness bacteria to break down compounds in urine. As the microbes digest the waste, they release electrons, which flow through a circuit to produce an electric current. A similar idea was explored at Northwestern University to draw nearly limitless energy from the soil using microbial fuel cells.

This method has been trialed in schools in Kenya and Uganda, where it powers LED lights in bathrooms and even charges small electronics. Beyond the novelty factor, this technology excels in places where grid power is expensive or unreliable, converting waste into a low-cost source of electricity.

While the power output is relatively small, it shows how unexpected bio-resources can help real communities meet basic energy needs. Who knew the restroom could be a mini power plant?

Tofu might be a protein-packed meal on your plate, but its production leaves behind loads of soybean pulp and wastewater. Instead of letting these byproducts go to waste, scientists have found a way to convert them into biogas using anaerobic digestion. In this oxygen-free process, microorganisms break down organic matter, releasing methane-rich gas that can be used for cooking, heating, or generating electricity.

Factories in Indonesia are already tapping into this system. What's clever is that tofu waste can produce the very energy that keeps tofu-producing factories running. It's cost-effective, sustainable, and reduces dependence on fossil fuels. Unlike high-tech innovations, this solution is relatively straightforward and simply repurposes existing waste materials and technology.

By turning food waste into fuel, tofu factories demonstrate how circular economies can reshape industries. Not only are they feeding people, they're also powering themselves and contributing to a greener energy grid.

Air travel is a notorious contributor to carbon emissions, but a slimy green solution could change that. Algae, rich in oils and fast-growing in saltwater, is emerging as a powerful candidate for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Unlike crops like corn or soy, algae doesn't compete with food supplies and produces far more oil per acre of land.

What makes algae oil especially exciting is its high calorific value, meaning it releases significant energy when burned. Airlines are under pressure to adopt SAF under the European Union's RefuelEU Aviation regulations, which require 2% SAF use by 2025, rising sharply in future decades. Algae biofuel could help to meet this demand without straining agricultural land or freshwater resources.

This unusual fuel source seems like science fiction, but it's real and faces significant challenges. Large-scale cultivation, affordability, and building supply chains are just some of the hurdles preventing widespread adoption. Still, the vision of planes powered by photosynthetic organisms harvested from the sea is compelling.

Cows aren't just milk and beef machines — they're also renewable energy generators. Their manure, which has always been useful for crops, is now helping to light up houses and run machines. When processed in biogas plants, cow manure breaks down into methane-rich gas that can heat homes, generate electricity, and even fuel vehicles. The leftover material is a nutrient-rich biofertilizer, creating a zero-waste system.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, 28 times stronger than carbon dioxide. When released into the atmosphere unchecked, it contributes heavily to global warming. By capturing it for energy, farms prevent harmful emissions while creating usable fuel. For example, in Japan, a biogas facility handles about 250 tons of manure daily, producing 1.2 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 2,200 homes per year.

This approach turns farms into power plants. Instead of contributing to climate problems, livestock operations can become part of the solution. It's dirty work, but the result is a cleaner environment and a steady source of renewable power.

Every bottle of wine we enjoy leaves behind a surprisingly large amount of skins, seeds, and stems that are collectively called grape pomace. Traditionally, wineries either discard this material or use small amounts for livestock feed, but researchers are now turning it into bioethanol. By fermenting the natural sugars found in pomace with yeast, ethanol is produced, which can then be blended into fuel for cars or used as a renewable energy source.

The process has major environmental advantages. Instead of letting grape waste rot in landfills where it would release methane (a powerful greenhouse gas), it's transformed into a clean-burning fuel, helping to reduce reliance on petroleum.

Countries with thriving wine industries such as France, Italy, and Spain are especially well-positioned to scale this technology. With millions of tons of pomace generated annually, the energy potential is vast. What was once winery trash could end up fueling cars, blending sustainability with one of the world's oldest industries.

Slipping on a banana peel is a comedy trope, but in real life those peels can generate energy. When processed in anaerobic digesters, banana waste breaks down to release methane-rich gas, which can be used for cooking and electricity. According to researchers from the Agro-Energy Group at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM), banana waste can provide up to 55% of the electrical needs of the Ecuadorian province of El Oro.

The potential is massive. A single kilogram of dried banana peels can produce up to 0.3 cubic meters of biogas — enough to run a small generator. With more than 125 million metric tons of bananas produced worldwide each year, the fuel capacity is staggering.

Urban markets and food processors throw away tons of banana waste daily. Instead of leaving it to rot in landfills (where it releases methane anyway), centralized digesters can capture that energy for communities. In some regions, researchers are even producing bioethanol from banana waste for vehicles. That means your fruit snack could one day help fuel cars.

What happens to the truckloads of tomatoes that spoil before reaching supermarket shelves? Instead of being discarded, scientists have discovered that these rotting tomatoes can actually generate electricity using microbial electrochemical cells. In this system, microbes feed on tomato waste and release electrons during digestion. Electrodes capture those electrons, creating an electric current.

Tomatoes are especially useful in this process because they contain lycopene, a natural pigment that improves the transfer of electrons. Even small amounts of waste (just 10 milligrams) can produce about 0.3 watts of power, so imagine the potential in farming regions where tons of produce are often lost due to oversupply or transport issues.

If farms and processing plants harnessed this method, they could generate energy to power their own facilities instead of paying for costly waste disposal. Microbial fuel cells are still in the early stages of development, but they're a great example of turning food loss into useful energy.

Plastic pollution is one of the world's biggest environmental headaches, but what if trash bags and bottles could be transformed back into fuel? Through a process called pyrolysis, non-recyclable plastics are heated in the absence of oxygen. This breaks their long polymer chains into smaller hydrocarbons, producing pyrolysis oil, which is a viable alternative to gasoline.

Unlike traditional recycling processes, pyrolysis can handle dirty or mixed plastics. Startups such as Petgas in Mexico are already proving the concept, converting 1.5 tons of plastic waste into 356 gallons of fuel in a week. The market for this fuel is currently valued at more than $1.4 billion in the U.S. alone, and it's projected to significantly grow in the next decade.

Challenges remain but pyrolysis offers a promising way to turn a waste crisis into an energy opportunity. Instead of piling up in landfills or choking oceans, plastics could literally keep engines running.

The promise of waste-to-energy is exciting, but adoption isn't simple. Many of these technologies struggle with high implementation costs, limited infrastructure, and skepticism from policymakers that favor established fuel sources. However, without supportive policies and public buy-in, many of these ideas may remain trapped in laboratories instead of reaching communities.

The potential payoff of adoption is clear. Diverting food waste into anaerobic digesters would reduce landfill emissions, lower energy costs, and provide decentralized power for small businesses.

The area spread across 5,50,000 acres of arid land. This is nearly three times the size of Singapore. The project is expected to transform India’s renewable energy landscape.

Addressing shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting on Friday, Ambani said the site would install 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers every day at peak pace, making it among the fastest rollouts globally. Within the next decade, the project could generate enough power to meet almost 10% of India’s electricity needs.

The facility will be integrated with Reliance’s existing marine and land infrastructure at Jamnagar and Kandla, enabling large-scale solar and hydrogen production. Ambani added that Reliance will focus on producing and exporting green ammonia, green methanol and sustainable aviation fuel, with a goal of scaling up to 3 million tonnes per annum of green hydrogen equivalent capacity by 2032.

Reliance’s solar PV manufacturing platform has also become operational, with the first 200 MW of heterojunction technology (HJT) modules already rolling out. These modules deliver higher energy yield, improved temperature performance and lower degradation compared with conventional panels. The facility will expand to 10 GWp of capacity in the near term and eventually 20 GWp, making it the largest integrated solar manufacturing site in the world.

In parallel, the company is building giga factories for batteries and electrolysers. The battery unit will begin operations in 2026 with a capacity of 40 GWh, scalable to 100 GWh. The electrolyser unit is scheduled to start by end-2026 with 3 GW of annual capacity, supporting cost-competitive green hydrogen production.

Ambani said the integration of solar, storage and hydrogen under one ecosystem will bring cost and technology advantages while strengthening supply chain resilience, positioning Reliance as a leader in the global energy transition.

Alaska stands at a crossroads in its economic development. Vast untapped resources could propel our state into a new era of prosperity, but without the infrastructure to move them to market, they remain stranded. Central to unlocking this potential are the Point MacKenzie Rail Spur and Port MacKenzie.

The rail spur, a 32-mile extension connecting Port MacKenzie to the Alaska Railroad mainline near Houston, creates the shortest rail route from the Interior to tidewater. Port MacKenzie itself is a deep-draft facility across Knik Arm from Anchorage, with 9,000 acres of industrial land ready for exports and logistics. It is as ice-free as the Port of Anchorage, has never needed dredging, and can handle Panamax-size ships. The dock already has the safety features in place, making it an excellent solution for bulk exports.

This is not a pie-in-the-sky idea. Most of the infrastructure is already built, with nearly $184 million invested. What remains is leadership to finish the job. We cannot call ourselves a resource state while refusing to complete the transportation projects that move our resources to market. The return on investment is undeniable, and the benefits far outweigh any lingering concerns.

Completing the spur would mean thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions in new revenue. Up to 3,000 jobs in mining, timber, energy, and construction could be created, and the project could generate $300 million annually in royalties, fees, and taxes. A 2007 study projected $4.4 billion in long-term benefits. These are not speculative numbers; they reflect the enormous value of turning stranded assets into revenue-producing exports in a state that develops resources better, safer, and with more environmental concern than anywhere else in the world.

The resources are already there. Copper and zinc from the Ambler Mining District, where companies plan to export 1.7 million tons annually, could move through Port MacKenzie. The same is true for graphite, antimony, rare earths, and other minerals critical to modern technology. Timber and coal exports would gain new life with this route, reducing shipping costs by up to 70 percent compared to trucking or air. The biomass and LNG needed for globally required Sustainable Aviation Fuel are available through Port Mack and could be produced right there. In a global market where efficiency determines competitiveness, that margin is decisive.

This infrastructure would make Alaska’s resources competitive in global markets, especially with our Indo-Pacific Allies. It would directly support projects such as the $43 billion Alaska LNG development, which depends on efficient material transport. For a state struggling with declining oil revenues and population stagnation, diversification through Port Mack is not optional; it is imperative.

The advantages are not just economic but strategic. Alaska’s Interior holds critical minerals the nation needs for technology, renewable energy, and defense. Today those assets are trapped, forcing dependence on foreign suppliers, including China, for materials like rare earths and antimony. Completing the rail spur aligns with President Trump’s 2025 Executive Order expanding rail infrastructure for oil, gas, timber, coal, and minerals. It advances energy independence, strengthens national security, and supports Arctic defense by creating an efficient logistics route between Interior bases and tidewater.

Critics point to Port MacKenzie’s limited past use, but without rail access the port cannot attract the volume needed for viability. This is a chicken-and-egg problem. Completing the spur breaks the cycle, opening the door to high-volume and bulk exports and finally putting this asset to work for Alaskans.

The construction progress underscores how close we are. Seventy-five percent of the spur is complete, including 25 miles of embankment, bridges, 110 culverts, and a one-mile loop. What remains is track and signaling. This is not a shovel-ready project; it is beyond shovel-ready and overdue.

Concerns about navigation in Cook Inlet and winter operations are real but not insurmountable. They are the same issues faced by the Port of Anchorage. More powerful tugboats and skilled pilots have already solved these challenges, and operators themselves confirm the risks are well within their capabilities. What is not acceptable is continuing to let our mineral wealth sit idle while past investments gather dust.

Diversification for Alaska is not optional; it’s imperative. We need infrastructure that creates jobs, broadens our revenue base, and strengthens our position in global supply chains. The Point MacKenzie Rail Spur and Port MacKenzie do exactly that. They offer Alaska the chance to move from potential to production, from stagnation to growth.

The next governor must make this project a priority. That means securing federal grants, state bonds, and private investment to finish the job. It means streamlining regulations to move construction forward. And it means standing up to critics who are content to watch opportunity slip away for political reasons. Alaska cannot afford another decade of delay.

In the end, this is not about politics or one port or rail line. It is about whether Alaska will live up to its identity as a resource state. The jobs, the revenue, the strategic advantages, and the diversification are all within reach. What we need now is the leadership to bring them across the finish line.

The Point MacKenzie Rail Spur and Port MacKenzie are the linchpins of Alaska’s future. They will define whether our resources remain stranded in the Interior or flow to world markets. They will determine whether our state prospers or continues to tread water. The choice before the next governor is simple: finish what Alaska has already started, or let our resources, and our children’s future, remain stranded. The right choice is clear.

Cette prouesse a été accomplie par un Boeing 787 de Virgin Atlantic, reliant Londres Heathrow à New York JFK. L’utilisation du SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) ne représente pas seulement un exploit technique, mais marque aussi une avancée décisive dans la réduction de l’empreinte carbone de l’aviation. Ce vol constitue une étape cruciale vers une aviation plus respectueuse de l’environnement, tout en soulignant l’importance de l’innovation pour lutter contre la pollution.

Le SAF : un carburant révolutionnaire

Le SAF, ou carburant d’aviation durable, révolutionne le secteur par son origine principalement issue de déchets organiques. Il utilise des huiles de cuisson usagées et des graisses animales, transformées par un procédé appelé HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids). Ce mélange contient également un pourcentage de kérosène aromatique synthétique dérivé de sucres végétaux. Cette composition permet au SAF d’être entièrement compatible avec les infrastructures actuelles de l’aviation. Virgin Atlantic mise sur ce carburant pour atteindre l’objectif ambitieux de zéro émission nette de carbone d’ici 2050, soulignant son rôle essentiel dans la décarbonation du secteur.

« C’est un miracle mécanique » : un Boeing 787 réussit le premier vol transatlantique 100 % carburant durable et ridiculise les sceptiques

Les traînées de condensation : un défi majeur

Outre l’efficacité du SAF, le vol de Virgin Atlantic a permis de mettre en lumière un autre enjeu environnemental : les traînées de condensation. Ces traces blanches, laissées par les avions, jouent un rôle significatif dans le réchauffement climatique. Une étude récente révèle que 57 % de l’impact climatique de l’aviation entre 2000 et 2018 est attribuable à ces traînées, surpassant même les émissions de CO2. Le Rocky Mountain Institute, en collaboration avec d’autres partenaires, explore des solutions pour minimiser cet effet en partageant les données collectées lors du vol avec l’industrie aéronautique.

Un soutien gouvernemental indispensable

Ce vol historique n’aurait pas été possible sans le soutien du gouvernement britannique, qui a assuré son financement. Cela a non seulement permis la réalisation du vol, mais a aussi encouragé les recherches sur les traînées de condensation. Le gouvernement s’engage à partager les découvertes avec l’industrie pour élaborer des procédures de vol visant à réduire l’impact climatique. Ces initiatives sont essentielles pour atteindre les objectifs environnementaux fixés et stimuler l’innovation dans l’aéronautique. L’implication des autorités est cruciale pour accélérer la transition vers une aviation durable.

L’avenir de l’aviation durable

Le succès de ce vol transatlantique représente un pas important vers une aviation plus propre. Grâce à des innovations telles que le SAF et les recherches sur les traînées de condensation, l’aviation pourrait réduire considérablement son empreinte carbone. Cependant, des défis subsistent. Il est fondamental de poursuivre les investissements en recherche et développement et de renforcer la collaboration internationale pour que ces technologies deviennent la norme.

Kegiatan itu turut para ahli pangan dan lingkungan dari berbagai belahan dunia seperti Johan Kieft ahli lingkungan Badan Perserikatan Bangsa-Bangsa, Dr Idesert Jelsma peneliti Belanda, Prof Ir Usman Pato yang merupakan peneliti bidang ketahanan pangan lulusan Gifu University Jepang, serta sejumlah peneliti akademisi lainnya dari Malaysia dan Filipina.

Dalam pemaparannya, Jamtiko mengatakan bahwa ruang terbesar untuk penguatan ketahanan pangan dan energi dari komoditas sawit, yang selama ini menjadi penyumbang ekonomi Indonesia, bahkan pada saat beberapa krisis yang terjadi, adalah penguatan produtkivitas sawit petani.

“Ruang terbesar untuk improvement adalah dari sisi petani. Kita semua dapat berkolaborasi bersama, untuk meningkatkan produktivitas petani sawit Indonesia melalui intesifikasi,” kata Jatmiko.

Ia menjelaskan, penguatan produktivitas petani merupakan satu dari dua kunci utama yang diusung PTPN IV PalmCo untuk mendukung program nasional mewujudkan ketahanan pangan dan energi nasional.

Saat ini, rerata produktivitas petani sawit Indonesia masih di kisaran 2–3 ton crude palm oil (CPO) per hektare per tahun, jauh dari korporasi perkebunan yang dikelola secara profesional yang mampu mencapai 6 ton.

Untuk meminimalis disparitas itu, ia mengatakan PTPN IV PalmCo telah menempuh beragam inisiatif penting untuk mendongkrak produktivitas petani, mulai dari Program BUMN Untuk Sawit Rakyat, penyediaan bibit unggul bersertifikat yang kini tercatat lebih dari dua juta batang bibit sawit unggul telah diserap petani, penerapan skema off-taker yang menjangkau lebih dari 10.200 hektare, serta penguatan sistem kelembagaan organisasi koperasi.

Hingga 2024, PalmCo telah mendukung pencairan dana BPDPKS untuk areal peremajaan sawit mitra KUD seluas 15.321 hektare. Keberhasilan model kemitraan ini terlihat dari produktivitas tanaman menghasilkan (TM) plasma yang mencapai rata-rata 12,57 ton/Ha, bahkan ada yang mencapai 18,05 ton/Ha, melampaui standar nasional 12 ton/Ha.

“Peremajaan sawit rakyat (PSR) adalah kunci. Tanpa itu, kita akan kehilangan daya saing sekaligus melemahkan kontribusi sawit bagi ketahanan pangan dan energi. Dan melalui forum ini, kami berharap ke depan kita akan saling berkolaborasi dan bersinergi untuk bersama-sama memperkuat inisatif ini,” jelas Jatmiko yang disampaikannya menggunakan bahasa Inggris.

Jika kolaborasi untuk intesifikasi tersebut dapat terlaksana dengan baik, maka bukan hanya ketahanan pangan dari sektor sawit yang dapat di wujudkan, melainkan target pemerintah dalam implementasi B50 pada 2027 bisa terpenuhi. Untuk diketahui, target alokasi biodiesel B50 itu diperkirakan membutuhkan pasokan sekitar 20,11 juta kiloliter.

Lebih jauh, dalam paparannya, Jatmiko turut menyinggung bahwa perubahan iklim bukan lagi ancaman di masa depan, melainkan kenyataan yang berpotensi berdampak terhadap produktivitas pertanian global, termasuk komoditas kelapa sawit Indonesia. Tantangan ini jika tidak disikapi dengan bijak, maka sejarah Indonesia yang pernah menjadi eksportir gula di tahun 1930-an silam, dan kini malah menjadi salah satu importir gula terbesar dunia, juga dikhawatirkan akan terjadi dengan komoditas CPO.

Berdasarkan data yang ia paparkan, selama dekade 2015-2024 yang tercatat sebagai periode terpanas dalam sejarah, dengan konsentrasi CO₂ mencapai level tertinggi. Dampaknya, setiap kenaikan suhu 1°C menurunkan hasil panen antara 3,1 hingga 7,4 persen sehingga memicu yang disebut sebagai ‘climateflation’-kenaikan harga pangan akibat anomali iklim.

“Sehingga ini memerlukan solusi berkelanjutan yang hanya dapat diwujudkan melalui kolaborasi seluruh stakeholders, termasuk bapak ibu akademisi,” tuturnya lagi.

Sebagai produsen minyak sawit mentah (CPO) terbesar dunia yang menyumbang sekitar 60% pasokan global, ia menyebut Indonesia memiliki peran krusial. Namun, industri ini menghadapi tantangan multidimensi. Selain ruang perbedaan produktivitas antara petani dan korporasi yang tinggi, tekanan regulasi sustainability, khususnya dari Uni Eropa, juga semakin kompleks.

“Jadi selain kunci meningkatkan produktivitas petani, dan penguatan prinsip ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) juga harus berjalan berkesinambungan,” tegas Jatmiko.

Komitmen ESG PalmCo diwujudkan dengan pengembangan energi baru terbarukan (EBT). PalmCo telah mengoperasikan 7 unit Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Biogas (PLTBg) dan 4 unit co-firing biogas dengan total kapasitas 9,3 MW. Bahkan, perusahaan sedang dalam proses seleksi mitra untuk pengembangan 20 unit Compressed Biomethane Gas (CBG) dan 1 fasilitas Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Sehingga, di akhir penjelasannya, ia kembali menegaskan bahwa investasi strategis, kebijakan yang efektif, inovasi, dan kolaborasi yang erat antara petani dan industri, merupakan fondasi essential untuk membangun ketahanan dan mengamankan sistem pangan dan energi yang berkelanjutan bagi Indonesia.

“Sekali lagi kami sampaikan, kolaborasi adalah kunci menuju solusi berkelanjutan. Kesempatan ini kami harap menjadi awal yang baik untuk bersama mewujudkannya,” demikian dia.(Rizal).",https://koranpelita.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG-20250831-WA0023.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 13:58:00.243554

Global tours are known for their relatively heavy carbon footprints. However, Chris Martin and the band pledged to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by half compared to their last world tour.

Four years later, with the ongoing 2025 leg at London's Wembley Stadium, Coldplay is reportedly standing by that commitment. The band claims that

""72% of all tour waste has been diverted from landfill and sent for reuse, recycling, and composting.""

That is an improvement from 66% in 2023. Moreover, eighteen shows in 2023 were powered entirely by a tourable battery system built from recycled BMW batteries. Coldplay has also funded two solar-powered ocean cleanup river interceptors. Notably, for every ticket sold, a tree has been planted through the global reforestation nonprofit organization, One Tree Planted.

Their signature LED wristbands have also been reworked to be 100% reusable, recyclable, and made from plant-based materials. Dancefloors at select shows are designed to generate electricity when fans jump. These are a few of the sustainability steps that Coldplay has taken.

Regarding CO2 emissions, the band states on their official website:

""Where we cannot reduce, we will be drawing down any unavoidable emissions following recognised best practices such as guidance within the Oxford Principles for Net-Zero Aligned carbon offsetting. We have teamed up with DHL as the tour’s Official Logistics Partner in order to minimise emissions from freight and transportation.""

They also add:

""As leaders in the field of sustainable transport and logistics, DHL support the tour by offering solutions to minimise logistics-related emissions and other environmental impacts, from advanced biofuels in the air to electric vehicles on land. Where we cannot reduce, we will be drawing down any unavoidable emissions following the guidance within the Oxford Principles for Net-Zero Aligned carbon offsetting.""

Some other steps that Coldplay have mentioned on their website are as follows:

SOLAR: We install solar photovoltaic panels in the build-up to each show, behind the stage and on top of PA and delay towers. The show batteries start charging as soon as we arrive at the venue.

SUSTAINABLE BIOFUELS: Across the tour we are utilising renewable diesel, a palm-oil free HVO-type (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) biofuel, produced 100% from renewable raw materials, primarily waste and residues such as used cooking oil. HVO use can lower generator carbon emissions significantly. HVO also fuels our trucking in as many locations as possible, meaning super-low emissions - as much as 75 to 95% reduced emissions, from these parts of our show transportation as well.

BATTERY SYSTEM: Prior to the tour we worked with experts to develop the first ever mobile, rechargeable show battery, made from recyclable BMW i3 batteries, which can power 100% of our show with renewable energy wherever we take it. We have a number of other batteries in use that we can charge from multiple sources including solar energy and even kinetic energy from the fans.

KINETIC ENERGY: We install kinetic floors in locations around the stadium so that the fans' dancing can be converted into energy and literally help to power the show. We also install electricity-generating power bikes so that fans can actively charge our show batteries.

GRID RENEWABLES: Whenever it is available, we use mains power from 100% renewable sources.

Notably, Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin also pledged to take public transport whenever possible. He arrived in Cardiff by train for the band's shows at the venue.

Coldplay's partners for sustainable logistics, DHL, employ a carbon intelligence and monitoring system. For air transportation, DHL's GoGreen Plus program ensures Sustainable Aviation Fuel is used for the band's freight flights.

In June 2024, Coldplay announced that direct emissions from the first two years of the tour were 59% lower than their 2016-17 tour. DHL helped achieve an 85% reduction per flight compared to fossil fuels. That resulted in a 31% decrease in total transportation emissions in 2023.

New Delhi: Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance is developing one of the world’s largest single-site solar projects spread across 5,50,000 acres of dry land in Kutch, Gujarat. This entire area is three times the size of Singapore. This information was shared on Friday, August 29, by Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani.

At its peak, the solar project will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers every day, making it among the fastest installations globally, said Mukesh Ambani.

The site could meet nearly 10% of India’s electricity needs

Addressing the shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting, Ambani said that the site could meet nearly 10% of India’s electricity needs within the next decade. The project will connect seamlessly with Reliance’s marine and land infrastructure at Jamnagar and Kandla, enabling large-scale solar and hydrogen integration.

Production of green ammonia, green methanol, & sustainable aviation fuel

The company will produce and export green ammonia, green methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel, positioning India as a global hub for cost-competitive green hydrogen and its derivatives. The company plans to scale up to 3MTPA (million tonnes per annum) of green hydrogen equivalent production capacity by 2032, while the initial focus will be on meeting Reliance’s own captive demand, said Ambani.

Reliance’s solar PV manufacturing platform is now operational

Ambani also announced that Reliance’s solar PV manufacturing platform has become operational, producing its first 200 MW of heterojunction technology (HJT) modules. These deliver 10% higher energy yield, 20% better temperature performance, and 25% lower degradation.

The platform will expand to 10 GWp per annum of integrated solar PV manufacturing capacity in the coming quarters and further to 20 GWp, making it the largest solar manufacturing facility and the most integrated single-site solar complex globally.

Reliance is constructing battery and electrolyser giga factories

Reliance is also constructing battery and electrolyser giga factories. The battery giga factory will start functioning in 2026 with 40 GWh annual capacity, expandable to 100 GWh, while the electrolyser giga factory will start by end-2026 with a capacity of up to 3GW per year, enabling large-scale, cost-competitive green hydrogen production.

Ambani said the integrated solar, battery storage, and hydrogen ecosystem under one roof will provide scale, cost and technology advantages, and supply chain resilience, creating long-term value as the global energy transition gathers pace.

Summary In August 2025, Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), REC Limited, and Praj Industries each present unique investment narratives shaped by recent financial results and market dynamics.
Conversely, Praj Industries faces intense near-term pressure due to ethanol policy stagnation and geopolitical uncertainties, balanced by promising green energy diversification prospects.","Rail Vikas Nigam (RVNL), REC, Praj Industries were among losers on Friday as overall market sentiment was bearish during the week. RVNL touched yearly lows and there are many other public sector companies that could see fresh 52-week lows next week. IREDA and IRFC are also looking weak on technical charts. Praj Industries also faces selling pressure and the stock touched 52-week low during Friday's session. TopNews Team has reviewed news and technical levels for these stocks.

Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL): Navigating Earnings Headwinds Amid Contract Wins

RVNL reported a 40% year-over-year profit decline in Q1 fiscal 2026, sinking to Rs 134.36 crore, fueled predominantly by diminished revenue and operational challenges. Revenue from operations dipped roughly 4% to Rs 3,908.77 crore, while total income contracted 4.6% year-on-year to Rs 4,136.96 crore. This underperformance triggered a significant share price drop, with RVNL down about 24% year-to-date in 2025 and trading beneath crucial technical moving averages, reflecting bearish momentum.

The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates oversold conditions, suggesting potential for continued short-term weakness. Meanwhile, fresh Letters of Acceptance from Southern Railway and IRCON International signal ongoing contract acquisitions that may bolster future revenue streams. Notwithstanding, RVNL's full fiscal year 2025 revenue missed analyst forecasts by nearly 9.5%, with earnings per share also falling short by 11%.

Analyst Perspectives on RVNL

Market sentiment for RVNL is cautious, as recent analyst ratings predominantly cluster around ""hold"" and ""strong sell"" recommendations, with no current ""buy"" endorsements. Price targets vary, averaging approximately Rs 272 for the next twelve months, ranging from Rs 204 at the low end to Rs 340 at the high end. Anticipated revenue growth is modest, forecasted at a CAGR of roughly 9.7% over the coming two years, lagging behind the broader construction sector's 13% growth rate. This positions RVNL amidst moderate growth prospects but with pronounced near-term margin pressures and operational risks.

REC Limited: Strong Fundamentals Amid Market Pessimism

REC Limited recently touched a fresh 52-week low around Rs 350, declining over 8% in a single week and falling approximately 44% year-on-year. The stock currently trades below all primary moving averages (5, 20, 50, 100, 200-day), reflecting a bearish investor outlook.

Despite these headwinds, REC exhibits compelling long-term financial health, boasting a return on equity of about 20.3% and a robust dividend yield exceeding 5%, signaling intrinsic value that appears undervalued in the short term. The company also announced record PBDIT of Rs 14,520.76 crore and profit after tax of Rs 4,465.71 crore in its latest disclosures. Institutional holdings remain strong at 34.72%, underscoring sustained institutional confidence.

Analyst Sentiment and Price Targets for REC Limited

From a coverage perspective, 14 analysts recently assigned REC a decisive ""strong buy"" consensus. Average price targets hover near Rs 525, with projections ranging from Rs 460 to as high as Rs 633. This analyst optimism reflects belief in the stock’s undervaluation and confidence in a recovery trajectory underpinned by solid fundamentals and positive earnings surprises.

Praj Industries: Challenges Amid Ethanol Market Uncertainty and Green Energy Ambitions

Praj Industries faces a difficult year, with shares down over 50% year-to-date and foreign portfolio investor holdings dropping to a six-quarter low near 16.9%. Persistent profit declines have marked the trend, including an 8.4% drop in Q1 consolidated revenue and a striking 94% plunge in profits. Market caution stems from achieving the 20% ethanol blending target (EBP20) without further mandates, dampening near-term growth prospects.

Geopolitical uncertainty, notably US tariff policies, has delayed capital expenditure and growth momentum. However, the company reported a healthy order intake valued at about Rs 7,950 million, which could offer some near-term revenue stability. Management highlights that India’s installed ethanol capacity now surpasses current blending needs, likely deferring additional expansions until policy revisions occur.

Analyst Views on Praj Industries

The stock carries a neutral rating from analysts, averaging a one-year target price of Rs 444, with a range from Rs 346 to Rs 580. This stance encapsulates cautious optimism, tempered by profit margin pressures and demand uncertainties. The company’s long-term vision targets Rs 100 billion in revenue by 2030, fueled by ventures into sustainable aviation fuel, green hydrogen, biopolymers, and other clean energy sectors, buoyed by favorable US policies incentivizing clean fuel production and carbon capture.

Strategic Conclusion for Investors

By August 2025, these three equities reveal markedly differing outlooks shaped by company-specific and macroeconomic factors. RVNL contends with immediate earnings setbacks but is buoyed by new project acquisitions that could foster operational stability. REC Limited, although grappling with near-term price declines, remains fundamentally robust, offering a potentially undervalued opportunity supported by strong institutional backing and positive analyst projections. Meanwhile, Praj Industries confronts significant headwinds attributable to ethanol blending policy stagnation and market hesitancy, yet its growth prospects in green and clean energy domains offer strategic promise.

Investors should carefully balance these elements against their risk tolerance and investment timelines, while paying attention to evolving sectoral dynamics and policy frameworks influencing infrastructure and sustainable energy sectors.

Summary

In August 2025, Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), REC Limited, and Praj Industries each present unique investment narratives shaped by recent financial results and market dynamics. RVNL's sharp Q1 profit drop and subdued revenue growth have sown investor caution, despite new contract wins. REC Limited, while trading near 52-week lows, boasts strong fundamentals and analyst optimism signaling potential undervaluation. Conversely, Praj Industries faces intense near-term pressure due to ethanol policy stagnation and geopolitical uncertainties, balanced by promising green energy diversification prospects. Investors must navigate these contrasting outlooks, balancing risk tolerance with macroeconomic and sector-specific factors impacting these infrastructure and clean energy plays.",,N,,2025-08-31 13:58:52.819250

Managing Director (Current Charge), Dhaka Bank

The Daily Star (TDS): How would you evaluate the current state of sustainable banking in Bangladesh?

A K M Shahnawaj (AKMS): Sustainable banking in Bangladesh has made remarkable strides in recent years, transitioning from a niche concept to a core strategic priority within the financial sector. The pivotal role of Bangladesh Bank — through its sustainable and green finance guidelines, refinancing facilities for renewable energy and energy-efficient projects, and mandatory sustainability reporting — has been instrumental in accelerating this growth. At Dhaka Bank, we have wholeheartedly embraced these initiatives, embedding environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations deeply into our lending and investment decisions.

While sustainable finance currently represents a growing segment of the credit market, the foundation is firmly in place for rapid expansion. With increasing awareness, advancing technical capacity, and evolving transition finance, we are confident that Bangladesh is well positioned to scale sustainable finance significantly to meet its climate and sustainable development goals. The progress so far inspires optimism for a green and resilient future.

TDS: What sustainable financing/refinancing schemes does your bank offer, particularly for SMEs, women entrepreneurs, or other environmentally responsible enterprises?

AKMS: Dhaka Bank is deeply committed to promoting sustainable finance and actively participates in Bangladesh Bank's refinancing initiatives targeting renewable energy, particularly solar power, energy-efficient machinery, waste management, effluent treatment, and eco-friendly industrial projects. For sectors such as Ready-Made Garments and large-scale manufacturing, we leverage programmes including the Refinance for Environment-Friendly Green Projects, the Technology Development Fund, and the Green Transformation Fund to facilitate the adoption of energy-efficient technologies.

For SMEs, we provide access to government and central bank refinance schemes, including the Tk. 25,000 crore CMSME programme at 7% interest, the agro-processing refinance facility, and the SME Foundation's revolving fund at 6%. Additionally, our Start-up Fund offers young entrepreneurs concessional loans of up to Tk. 80 million at just 4% interest.

We also provide targeted financing for businesses in rural areas, marginal traders, and women entrepreneurs, with concessional rates as low as 5%, including our Oditiya Loan designed specifically for women entrepreneurs.

Through these efforts, Dhaka Bank aims to promote inclusive growth and contribute to Bangladesh's sustainable development.

TDS: What initiatives has your bank undertaken to promote sustainable banking, and what measures have you implemented to reduce your own carbon footprint?

AKMS: At Dhaka Bank, sustainability is deeply ingrained in both our operational framework and corporate culture. We have dedicated Sustainable Finance Help Desks in every branch to integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk assessments into our credit appraisal processes through the Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) matrix.

Furthermore, training and awareness programmes are conducted to cultivate sustainability-mindedness among employees, ensuring accountability and engagement throughout the organisation.

Internally, we have implemented several initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint. These include digitising workflows — for example, adopting a ""go green"" approach for bill collection — to significantly lower paper consumption, and upgrading to energy-efficient lighting across our branch network.

Moreover, Dhaka Bank has recently partnered with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) to enhance our capacity for measuring and managing financed emissions. This collaboration underscores our commitment to transparency and accountability in assessing the environmental impact of our loan and investment portfolios, positioning us among the pioneers in Bangladesh to adopt globally recognised carbon accounting standards.

TDS: What challenges has your bank encountered in adopting and promoting sustainable banking practices?

AKMS: We face several challenges. Many borrowers lack the technical capacity to develop green projects and often perceive sustainable technologies as costly with delayed returns. The absence of standardised ESG data complicates impact assessment and risk evaluation. Although Bangladesh Bank's refinancing schemes are beneficial, the local market for green bonds and sustainability-linked loans is still emerging, limiting financing avenues for large-scale initiatives. Moreover, cultivating a sustainability mindset among clients and staff requires sustained education and incentives.

TDS: What are your bank's future plans to advance sustainable banking, and what support do you seek from the government?

AKMS: Our strategy focuses on three key pillars: scaling, innovation, and partnership. We plan to increase our green financing portfolio substantially, focusing on renewable energy generation, climate-resilient infrastructure, sustainable agriculture, and energy-efficient industrial modernisation.

We intend to introduce innovative financing instruments such as sustainability-linked loans, where borrowers receive better terms for meeting ESG targets, and explore partnerships with international climate funds to secure concessional financing for Bangladesh's green transition.

In terms of government support, fiscal incentives such as tax breaks for green investments, import duty exemptions on eco-friendly technologies, and targeted grants or subsidies will catalyse private sector participation. Capacity-building programmes are also vital — training entrepreneurs, stakeholders, and bankers in sustainable practices ensures long-term market growth and effectiveness.

A supportive, predictable regulatory environment combined with targeted incentives will be crucial for mobilising private capital at scale to meet the country's ambitious sustainable development goals.",https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2025/08/31/shahnawaz.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 20:56:10.209694

Esteemed Members,

Welcome to the 66th Annual General Meeting of your Company.

This annual meeting is not just a statutory occasion but a celebration of our shared journey — a journey built on trust, resilience, and a steadfast commitment to energise India’s progress.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to each one of you for your continued confidence in the Company and for staying invested in our vision.

Business Outcomes

The year gone by reminded us that energy is never just about markets and molecules; it is shaped by the pulse of geopolitics.

The Russia–Ukraine conflict, now in its third year, continued to cast a shadow on global stability. New fault lines in the Middle East, disruptions in the Red Sea, and heightened tensions around the Strait of Hormuz unsettled vital energy corridors. Towards the close of the year, tariff hikes in the United States added fresh headwinds, shaking investor confidence.

Against this backdrop of volatility and uncertainty, your Company delivered a resilient performance during 2024–25.

Sales volumes crossed the historic 100 million metric tonne mark, supported by beyond-capacity processing across 10 refineries.

Our 20,000 km pipeline network ensured seamless movement of hydrocarbons, underscoring the strength of our integrated model.

With over 40,000 fuel stations energising 3.2 crore customers every day, and Indane LPG trusted in 15 crore kitchens, IndianOil remains at the heart of India’s energy ecosystem.

Alongside refining and marketing, we maintained a strong presence in petrochemicals, natural gas, and E&P, reinforcing our diversified energy footprint.

On the financial front:

Revenue from Operations stood at ₹8.45 lakh crore, keeping us among India’s top three corporates.

Net Profit was ₹12,962 crore — the highest among OMC peers, though moderated from last year due to weaker refining margins, LPG under-recoveries, and exchange losses.

In Q1 FY 2025–26, your Company delivered its highest-ever quarterly sales and a consolidated net profit of ₹6,808 crore — nearly double that of the same period last year.

SPRINT: Powering Transformation

Resilience alone is not enough. To sustain leadership, we must evolve with speed and agility. With this vision, we launched Project SPRINT this fiscal.

SPRINT sharpens competitiveness across six focus areas:

Strengthening core businesses

Optimising costs

Reinforcing customer-centricity

Accelerating innovation and digitalisation

Nurturing talent

Advancing the energy transition

At its heart lies the 3Cs (Core, Cost, Customer) and 3Ts (Technology, Talent, Transition).

The impact is already visible:

One refinery is on track to become the first PSU refinery in India to achieve a Quartile-1 ranking in the Solomon Benchmarking Index.

Nearly half of new PSU OMC retail outlets since April 2025 have been IndianOil’s.

Non-fuel revenues grew 49% year-on-year in the first four months of this fiscal.

Cost optimisation initiatives are delivering higher efficiency and sustained profitability.

Reinforcing the Legacy

As India prepares to become the largest driver of global oil demand by 2035, your Company is scaling:

Refining capacity from 80.75 MMTPA to 98.4 MMTPA by 2028.

Pipeline network beyond 22,000 km, with 21 projects underway.

Petrochemicals capacity from 4.3 MMTPA to over 13 MMTPA by 2030, with a sharp focus on specialty chemicals.

We also advanced in upstream with 25 assets across India and overseas, including new hydrocarbon discoveries in Abu Dhabi, resumption in Libya, and acquisition of Mercator Petroleum in the Cambay Basin.

India’s Energy Lifeline

From fuel stations, LPG, and CNG to aviation, mobility, lubricants, and natural gas, IndianOil continues to be India’s most trusted energy partner.

Highlights of 2024–25 include:

14,000 EV chargers and 865 battery-swapping stations, advancing clean mobility.

68 Way Side Amenities and 138 Apna Ghar facilities for highway users and truckers.

LPG leadership strengthened with 45% market share and the launch of Chhotu Master (compact 5 kg LPG cylinder + cooktop).

Servo lubricants expanded to 45 countries, including the launch of Servo Futura eV for electric vehicles.

Natural gas sales surged 20% to 7.9 MMTPA; CGD JVs now cover 21% of India’s population.

Pioneering Innovation

Our R&D Centre is driving breakthroughs in green hydrogen, SAF, 2G ethanol, fuel cells, and carbon capture.

eCO₂Sorb, our patented enzyme-based carbon capture solution, is at pilot scale.

42 start-ups incubated under our Start-up Scheme have already generated 86 IPRs and 4 commercialized patents.

The upcoming New R&D Campus at Faridabad will lead frontier research in alternative energy and advanced sciences.

Transition to a Future-Ready Portfolio

We are transitioning into a diversified, integrated energy company anchored on three pillars:

Green Hydrogen – 10,000 TPA plant at Panipat (India’s largest).

Sustainable Aviation Fuel – India’s first ISCC-CORSIA certified SAF project; 30 KTPA from used cooking oil at Panipat.

Renewables – Clean energy portfolio scaling from 1 GW today to 18 GW in three years.

This green shift is supported by strong sustainability actions — 7 lakh trees planted, 89% wastewater reuse, GreenCo certifications, and a Net Zero by 2046 roadmap requiring ₹2.5 lakh crore investment.

Investments and Asset Optimisation

In 2024–25, IndianOil invested ₹40,000 crore, accounting for over one-fourth of MoPNG PSU CAPEX.

Over 160 projects worth ₹2.6 lakh crore are under execution.

Committed ₹1.66 lakh crore over five years with sharp focus on petrochemicals, natural gas, and renewables.

New revenue streams in bitumen, bunkering, LNG, cryogenics, and data transmission services are being seeded.

IOC Global Capital Management (IGCMIL) at GIFT City executed USD 500+ million in transactions, evolving into a Global Treasury Centre.

Driving Social Impact

In 2024–25, IndianOil spent ₹583 crore on CSR, touching 1.36 crore beneficiaries.

Healthcare focus: TB elimination, cancer care, sickle cell anaemia, dialysis centres.

Skilling & empowerment: Women, Divyangjan, and children rehabilitated through Badhte Kadam.

Growth for us is meaningful only when it uplifts lives.

Building Sports Champions

IndianOil athletes won 239 medals in 2024–25, including 85 global medals and India’s historic 29-medal Paralympics haul.

Our DivyaShakti initiative supports 100 para-athletes, half of them women. We remain committed to women’s hockey, para federations, and India’s “Road to LA 2028.”

Governance & Closing

Your Company upholds the highest standards of corporate governance, transparency, and preventive vigilance.

At the core of our journey lies one promise — energising lives with reliability, responsibility, and foresight.

I express my sincere gratitude to the Government of India, the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, regulators, banks, employees, stakeholders, and above all, our customers for their enduring trust and support.

With your continued encouragement, IndianOil will keep energising lives, unlocking new frontiers, and advancing our shared aspiration of a Viksit Bharat.

Thank You.

Managing Director, Eastern Bank

The Daily Star (TDS): How would you assess the current state of sustainable and green banking in Bangladesh?

Ali Reza Iftekhar (ARI): Over the past decade, sustainable and green banking in Bangladesh has made remarkable progress. When Bangladesh Bank first introduced its Sustainable Finance Policy and Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) guidelines, banks mostly treated them as compliance requirements. Today, sustainability has become a strategic priority for the country's leading institutions.

The banking sector now recognizes that financing cannot be separated from realities such as climate change, resource scarcity, and the demand for inclusive finance. Bangladesh Bank has accelerated this shift with green refinancing schemes, channeling affordable funding into renewable energy, waste management, and other green projects. The recent adoption of IFRS S1 and S2 on sustainability and climate disclosures has further aligned us with global standards.

Eastern Bank PLC (EBL) is proud to be ranked among the top ten sustainable banks in Bangladesh Bank's 2024 Sustainability Rating. For us, this recognition validates our long-term ESG commitments—but it is not a destination. It is a responsibility to keep moving forward.

TDS: What sustainable or green financing/refinancing schemes does your bank offer, particularly for SMEs, women entrepreneurs, or environmentally responsible enterprises?

ARI: At EBL, inclusiveness is central to our sustainable finance strategy. In 2024, 35.24% of our total term loan portfolio was directed to green projects—almost double the previous year. Overall, 89% of our portfolio now qualifies as sustainable finance.

We actively utilize Bangladesh Bank's refinancing schemes and have already disbursed over BDT 200 crore to renewable energy, energy efficiency, and waste management ventures. Beyond financing, we offer training, advisory support, and flexible repayment terms for SMEs and women entrepreneurs whose businesses embrace sustainability. We also mobilize foreign funding from DFIs such as IFC, DEG, FMO, OFID, and ADB, primarily for green investments.

To encourage innovation, our EBL Startup Explorer program, launched with Startup Bangladesh, directly finances green and impact-driven startups. We also partner with NGOs to provide tailored refinancing solutions to grassroots entrepreneurs. Our vision is clear: make sustainable finance accessible not just to large corporates, but also to SMEs, women entrepreneurs, and innovators driving change from the ground up.

TDS: What initiatives has your bank undertaken to promote sustainable banking, and how are you reducing your own carbon footprint?

ARI: Sustainability at EBL goes beyond financing—it is embedded in our operations.

Our Head Office is a green building, equipped with solar glass panels generating 16 kW of electricity daily, along with rainwater harvesting and wastewater treatment facilities. We use hybrid vehicles, smart AC systems, and energy-efficient lighting to further reduce consumption.

We are steadily moving towards a paperless culture. By digitizing LC processing, we've reduced paper use by 40–45%, saving more than a million sheets each year. Our e-leave, e-appraisal, and e-learning systems cut paper use further. On the customer side, digital platforms like EBL Connect and SkyPay process billions of taka electronically, reducing the carbon footprint of cash handling while enhancing efficiency and convenience.

EBL is also among the first banks in Bangladesh to measure Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions, including financed emissions, through the Joint Impact Model (JIM). Additionally, our partnership with DHL's GoGreen Plus program reduces 30% of emissions from trade document transport by using Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

TDS: What challenges has your bank encountered in adopting and promoting sustainable banking practices?

ARI: While progress is evident, challenges remain.

Data gaps: Measuring financed emissions across diverse industries remains difficult due to limited data quality and availability.

Awareness and capacity: Many borrowers—particularly SMEs—lack the technical know-how to adopt green technologies. Banks often need to invest in awareness and capacity-building before financing can be effective.

High upfront costs: Renewable energy or green building projects involve significant initial investment, discouraging entrepreneurs despite long-term savings. Here, concessional funding from Bangladesh Bank and DFIs plays a vital role

We believe stronger policy support—such as tax incentives for green technology and a carbon credit framework—would accelerate adoption across the financial sector.

TDS: What are your bank's future plans to advance sustainable banking, and what support do you seek from the government?

ARI: Looking ahead, EBL plans to introduce Green Deposit and Green Asset products, allowing customers to directly contribute to sustainable projects. We are also piloting a Climate Risk Diagnostic and Management Model with IFC and DEG, which integrates climate risk into credit decisions—making us one of the first banks in Bangladesh to embed climate risk into portfolio management.

To scale up these efforts, we seek government support in three areas:

1. Incentives for green investment — including interest subsidies, tax benefits, and accelerated depreciation for renewable and energy-efficient technologies.

2. Capacity-building programs — equipping SMEs and entrepreneurs with the skills to adopt sustainable practices.

3. A robust carbon market framework — enabling banks and businesses to monetize emission reductions and attract greater climate finance.

Our ambition is clear: to help shape a financial sector that not only drives economic growth but also safeguards the planet for future generations",https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2025/08/31/ebl-ali-reza-iftekhar.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 19:56:18.824778

""Japan is an important international market for Hawaiian Airlines, and we appreciate Cosmo’s investment in locally sourced SAF – the most effective technology to lower our carbon emissions – that we are now using on our flights between Osaka and Honolulu.” -- Alanna James, Sustainability innovation directorHawaiian Airlines

The SAF traded under this agreement was commercialized following Cosmo’s receipt of a New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) subsidy from the Japanese government in 2021, aimed at establishing a supply chain model for SAF production from used cooking oil sourced domestically in Japan. Cosmo Energy Group’s facility will be the first to mass produce SAF in Japan and the SAF will come with ISCC CORSIA and ISCC EU certifications. These certifications are part of the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) initiative, which recognizes compliance with international standards for sustainable products.

""SAF is one of our key decarbonization products and plays an essential role in the decarbonization of the aviation industry. We are delighted to contribute to the decarbonization efforts of global airline Alaska Airlines and its customers through SAF. Moving forward, we will continue to support the realization of a decarbonized society, starting with this collaboration, by promoting the use of SAF.” -- Naoki Takayama, President and representative directorCosmo Oil Marketing Co., Ltd.

The fuel will be produced by SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY LLC, a joint venture formed by Cosmo Oil Co., Ltd., JGC HOLDINGS CORPORATION, and REVO International Inc.

""Since 2021, with the support of the Japanese government, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry’s Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, and NEDO, we have been working with JGC HOLDINGS CORPORATION, Cosmo Oil Co., Ltd., and REVO International Inc. to commercialize SAF. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone involved for helping to build a major wave of domestic resource recycling through activities such as ACT for SKY and Fry to Fly.” -- Takeshi Takada, Representative SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY LLC

The Cosmo Energy Group has worked to establish a supply chain to deliver Japan’s first locally made SAF, with the goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Group is also helping build social momentum through initiatives such as an ongoing pilot program to collect household used cooking oil at service stations for repurposing into SAF feedstock.

Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines – both founded more than 90 years ago to connect communities, bring people together, transport products, and enable economic growth – are committed to stewarding their environmental impact to create a durable long-term future for the company. As the most fuel-efficient premium U.S. carriers, Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines have an ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 through investments in SAF, technology and fleet modernization, among other initiatives.
