At the same time, cross-border trade is emerging as a key growth area for Indian SMEs. In an interview, Sandeep Juneja, Vice President – Sales and Marketing, DHL Express India, shared how the company is adapting to evolving shopper preferences, investing in automation, and supporting small businesses with digital tools and global trade partnerships. From advanced sorting facilities and RFID-enabled visibility to SME-focused programmes like GoTrade and MyGTS, DHL Express India is building the infrastructure and intelligence needed to power the next phase of logistics in a digitally connected economy.

The DHL E-Commerce Trends Report 2025 shows that 80% of Indian shoppers abandon carts due to missing preferred delivery options. How is DHL Express India responding to these rising delivery expectations in terms of speed, flexibility, and transparency?

With a network that covers over 220 countries and territories, we can connect people and improve lives with great efficiency. This can only be done with the help of our people and leveraging automation where it counts. For example, our automatic shipment sorting hub in Delhi houses the automatic sorting machines with a capacity to sort 2000 pieces per hour, delivering a 30% improvement in productivity. Our services like 'Clear-in-air' facilitate customs clearance during transit, reducing delivery times. At every touchpoint, we ensure to maintain a high service level.

Security and transparency are crucial to our operations, and we ensure that our customers continue to trust us as their first choice. The integration of RFID chips within the supply chain helps us enhance shipment visibility, accuracy, and security. With the growing reliance on technology, cybersecurity threats remain on the rise. DHL therefore runs an information security management system with data centres and a robust set of objectives, processes, and guidelines underpinning our information security policy. To enhance visibility throughout the shipping process, we offer tools like Track & Trace, which allows shippers to monitor their shipments in real time and prevent delays.

Our ‘On Demand Delivery’ service empowers shippers and recipients to customise delivery preferences, offering them flexibility and reducing the likelihood of undelivered shipments, thereby improving customer satisfaction. DHL Express India has expanded its ODD platform, allowing customers to choose from a range of flexible options, including rescheduling deliveries, changing addresses, and selecting preferred delivery time windows. This has proven particularly effective in serving the needs of the growing e-commerce segment, where convenience and control directly influence purchase decisions.

Together, these efforts reinforce DHL Express India’s commitment to meeting the evolving expectations of modern consumers, strengthening our position as a trusted logistics partner for e-commerce growth in India.

With Indian consumers increasingly prioritising sustainability, how is DHL Express innovating in areas like green logistics, carbon offsetting, or packaging — and are there any notable partnerships driving these efforts?

The most notable progress is that we are one of the few organisations worldwide and the first in logistics to take a stand in reducing our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. We are doing what is technically feasible and commercially viable right now.

We have set milestones to focus our efforts and measure our progress, under Strategy 2030 where we have added ‘Green Logistics of Choice’ as our fourth bottom line. These transparent, time-bound targets and KPIs are integral to our strategic planning and decision-making processes, much like our financial goals. By 2030, over the base of 2021, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to <29m metric tons of carbon* by doubling down and accelerating decarbonisation measures across all operations.

Target >30% Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) blending in our Express and Global Forwarding businesses.

Electrify 66% of our last-mile delivery vehicles.

Leverage a carbon-neutral design for all new buildings.

As of 2024, we are incredibly proud to say that we have made significant headway against these targets. In 2021, GHG emissions stood at 40 million metric tons. Comparatively, in 2024, this was reduced to 33 million metric tons CO2e. In our buildings, we are expanding the use of solar power to generate electricity.

By 2024, as a Group, over half of our 66% last-mile electrification target was already achieved as 41.4% of our pickup and delivery vehicles were electrified.

We consistently advanced the decarbonization of our business activities, leveraging sustainable aviation fuel in our air transport activities. Through insetting, GoGreen Plus offers customers a measurable and certified way to reduce logistics-related emissions without relying on offsetting. The SAF used is sourced through global partnerships with suppliers like bp, Neste, Cosmo Oil Marketing and World Energy, and is produced from sustainable feedstocks such as used cooking oil and other residues. Through these strategic partnerships, we have succeeded in increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuels in our own fleet to 3.5%, despite the continued low availability of such fuels. This puts us well above the average for the logistics industry.

How are drones or autonomous vehicles being evaluated or adopted by DHL Express in the Indian mid-mile or first-mile logistics space? Could such innovations soon be viable at scale in this region?

We are always actively exploring new technology, including drones and autonomous vehicles to enhance the efficiency of our logistics operations.

DHL Express has long supported the global ambitions of Indian SMEs. With evolving trade dynamics, how are you enabling cross-border e-commerce growth for these businesses, especially in key verticals like fashion, electronics, jewellery and personal care?

DHL Express is committed to supporting the government’s active effort to make India an export-led, ‘aatmanirbhar’ (self-dependent) economy. MSME’s play a key role here as the backbone of India's economic landscape, pivotal in employment generation, entrepreneurship promotion, economic development and exports.

DHL’s GoTrade programmes specifically aims to foster international trade and promote sustainable economic growth by empowering MSMEs to engage in cross-border commerce. Leveraging our expertise in logistics, customs, and trade, the programme seeks to educate MSMEs on the strategic advantages of global trade and equip them with the necessary tools to access international markets. As a global trade facilitator with a presence in over 220 markets, our objective with GoTrade is to integrate MSMEs into the larger narrative of globalisation.

In the jewellery segment, for instance, we have signed an MoU with the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) to enable India-crafted jewellery to be shipped globally via our time-definite international (TDI) courier services. This ensures faster, more secure deliveries with complete shipment visibility. GJEPC members benefit from exclusive pricing and educational seminars that equip them with best practices in international shipping and compliance.

We have also signed an MoU with the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) to conduct training and capacity-building workshops across 76 districts in India. These sessions focus on building capabilities in global trade processes, documentation, and e-commerce fulfilment, particularly for sectors like fashion and personal care, where branding and timely delivery are critical.

Furthermore, by partnering with the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), we have onboarded over 200 SMEs. We are providing them with post-onboarding incubation support, including help with product selection, pricing, order management, and promotions—all of which are essential for success in verticals like electronics and personal care.

Additionally, DHL Express has implemented many digital solutions that help MSMEs and startups kickstart their global sales.

A tool like My Global Trade Services (myGTS) is particularly beneficial to sellers in their business strategy development phase. As a free, online, self-service pre-shipment planner, it allows companies to identify the correct Harmonised System (HS) codes to categorise products for shipping. It also offers preliminary data on existing free trade agreements between the source and target countries. This information gives sellers a transparent understanding of the associated costs, enabling effective product pricing. When the business is prepared to make the leap, they can open a DHL account from anywhere and at any time. The setup is also accessible to startups and individual shippers lacking a credit history.

DHL Express Commerce, integrating DHL Express shipping services with numerous e-commerce platforms, aids businesses in automating shipment creation and managing the fulfilment process. This feature is particularly useful for sellers who need to ship multiple orders efficiently.

The First Time Buyer (FTB) Programme is a dedicated initiative designed to support first-time shippers, including SMEs, especially those who are new to global trade. Recognising that first-time shippers often face uncertainty and complexity, the programme provides a structured, hand-held onboarding experience to build confidence and enable success. Over a 90-day support period, we proactively monitor shipments and conduct regular check-ins, ensuring that first-time shippers feel guided every step of the way.

Through these multi-stakeholder collaborations and targeted interventions, we are not only enabling Indian SMEs to meet global standards but also ensuring they are well-equipped to seize emerging opportunities in cross-border e-commerce.

Are you seeing any shift in demand across international trade lanes due to tariff changes or trade policy uncertainty? How do these developments affect your pricing, transit strategies, or customer communication?

What we have usually noticed is that when there is trade slowdown within one trade lane, we usually see trade picking up on another trade lane. Trade is ever evolving but so are we at DHL and therefore we remain dynamic, constantly keeping an eye on our network and ensuring that we are there for our customers in an uncertain and volatile environment.

DHL Express is often associated with speed and premium service. Are there new service offerings or digital tools being introduced in India that enhance customer control, delivery customisation, or predictive tracking?

Technology helps us remain one step ahead of the curve. Leveraging innovations such as real-time tracking systems, automated sorting facilities, and advanced data analytics to name a few, DHL is streamlining processes, reducing transit times, and offering a far superior customer experience. We have numerous tools that keep our ‘big yellow machine’ moving and more importantly excelling -

Right now, a liter of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per liter in the U.K. – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97.
They saw themselves as a crucial part of the sustainable aviation fuel puzzle, but were concerned about investing in logistics and infrastructure without guaranteed demand.
Their thinking is dominated by environmental strategy and sustainable aviation fuel regulation.
By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero.","As you wait in the departure lounge for your flight this summer, you may notice your airplane being pumped full of fuel ahead of takeoff. And then you may start to wonder why flying is still so dependent on fossil fuels, and whether you should have booked a holiday destination that’s accessible by a more environmentally friendly form of transport.

So what happened to plans for so-called sustainable aviation fuel? Wasn’t it supposed to be the “game changer” that would make flying a much greener travel option than it used to be?

Clearly, the move to adopt the technology is facing difficulties. One problem seems to be that there simply isn’t enough sustainable fuel to go around.

But the business side of the process is also holding back sustainable fuel uptake.

Research my colleagues and I conducted in 2021 revealed a deeply fragmented landscape at pretty much every step of sustainable fuel development. There are obstacles everywhere, blocking the paths of the producers developing these fuels, the airlines who might use them and the governmental and campaign groups pushing for change.

Everyone seems to agree that sustainable fuel matters. They just don’t all agree about how to really get it off the ground.

Our findings demonstrate that producers, for instance, were understandably focused on more research and development to improve efficient production. They were also worried that scaling up facilities could disrupt production that is already in place.

Airlines, meanwhile, are grappling with the economics of moving to sustainable fuel, which is around three to ten times more expensive than conventional fuel. Right now, a liter of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per liter in the U.K. – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97. (Depending on the length of the journey and the size of the engine, a plane could need around 13,000 liters per hour of flying.)

They spoke about inconsistent supply (especially at major airports), and the need for clearer regulations and incentives across the industry.

“Cost is clearly the most important driver,” one airline executive told us, explaining that dealing with those costs would ultimately depend on passenger demand for greener travel – and how willing those passengers are to pay a premium for sustainable fuel.

Distribution companies that take the sustainable fuel where it needs to go, have found themselves struggling to navigate the complexities of an emerging supply chain. They spoke of the logistical challenges of transporting and storing sustainable fuel, and a lack of clear communication between producers and airlines.

They saw themselves as a crucial part of the sustainable aviation fuel puzzle, but were concerned about investing in logistics and infrastructure without guaranteed demand.

Elsewhere, politicians and climate campaigners tend to view the adoption of sustainable fuel from a broader perspective, stressing the urgency of action on climate change. Their thinking is dominated by environmental strategy and sustainable aviation fuel regulation.

But here, trust becomes an issue. Some of those involved with sustainable fuel development said they doubted government promises to support the sector over the long term. Others are cynical about whether airlines will really prioritize climate action over their very tight profit margins.

Up in the air

So sustainable fuel inspires plenty of different viewpoints and concerns. But one common thread was an overwhelming concern about cost and scale of production.

Aside from being far more expensive than fossil-based jet fuel, building enough production facilities to make more will require billions of pounds of investment.

The big question is who will foot the bill.

Some of this will need to be tax funded. For if the U.K. wants to become a leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel, as the government says it does, it needs more than ambitious targets. It needs to start making things happen.

And our research suggests that the industry as a whole would benefit from some certainty to encourage investment right across the supply chain. Without a clear and stable regulatory framework, everyone will remain hesitant about committing significant resources to sustainable fuel.

Collaboration between the key players could also be improved, with a better dialogue between those in the industry and regulators, potentially leading to a shared vision for the future of sustainable aviation fuel.

That future is by no means doomed. Major commercial airlines like Air France-KLM, IAG (British Airways) and United Airlines in the US are working with sustainable fuel producers around the world.

But while the desire to decarbonize aviation seems clear, the path forward is not straightforward. It is a complex picture of politics, economics, trust and differing priorities.

By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero. But if managed poorly, targets to dramatically increase its use will remain elusive.",,N,,2025-07-27 05:56:09.652631

Heathrow Airport said it had always been clear about funding Back Heathrow, but would not disclose how much it provides.
Despite its 98% capacity, Heathrow Airport has broken passenger number records every year for the past 14 years - excluding the pandemic years of 2020 to 2023.
Speaking for the campaign group, Mr Dhanda said: ""At Back Heathrow we are proud of our link to Heathrow Airport (the clue is in the name).","A campaign group for a third runway at Heathrow that gets funding from the airport has been distributing ""incredibly misleading"" information to households in west London, according to opponents of the expansion.

The group, called Back Heathrow, sent leaflets to people living near the airport, claiming expansion could be the route to a ""greener"" airport and suggesting it would mean only the ""cleanest and quietest aircraft"" fly there.

It comes as the airport prepares to submit its planning application for a third runway ahead of the 31 July deadline, following the government's statement of support for the expansion.

Back Heathrow calls itself a ""local campaign group of over 100,000 residents"" and does not mention the funding it receives from the airport in the newsletter.

Its website also does not mention the current financial support and says it ""initially launched with funding from Heathrow Airport but we have since grown"".

Back Heathrow also told Sky News it had ""always been open"" about the support it receives from the airport.

At the bottom of every web page, the organisation says: ""Back Heathrow is a group of residents, businesses and community groups who have come together to defend the jobs that rely on Heathrow and to campaign for its secure future.""

Heathrow Airport said it had always been clear about funding Back Heathrow, but would not disclose how much it provides.

Who's behind Back Heathrow?

The group's executive director is former Labour minister Parmjit Dhanda, who was MP for Gloucester from 2001 to 2010 and sits on the National Policy Forum - the body responsible for developing Labour policy.

Latest accounts for Back Heathrow show it had five employees, including its two directors, in the financial year ending 30 June 2024. The second director is John Braggins, a former campaign adviser to Tony Blair.

The business had £243,961 in cash, the accounts show.

What are the group saying?

In the newsletter, executive director Mr Dhanda said people ask if Heathrow is sustainable. In answering the question, he appeared to suggest the airport can dictate what types of planes use Heathrow.

""We can build a cleaner, greener and smarter airport - using more sustainable aviation fuel, ensuring only the cleanest and quietest aircraft fly here, reduce stacking in our skies and modernise our airspace to cut emissions in flight,"" he wrote.

When asked by Sky News what Back Heathrow meant and what the source for the claim was, the organisation pointed to the airport's traffic light system of noise and emission measurements for the 50 largest airlines serving Heathrow.

""The scheme helps to see what areas certain airlines are excelling in and where improvements can be made,"" a spokesperson said.

But those ""cleaner and greener"" claims were dismissed as ""myths"" by one campaigner.

Finlay Asher is an aerospace engineer and co-founder of Safe Landing, a group of aviation workers and enthusiasts seeking climate improvements in the industry.

He said the emissions savings from sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) were ""highly debatable"" - but added that even if they were taken at face value, use of these fuels is ""relatively low"" and so only provides small emissions reductions.

""Air traffic growth at Heathrow will wipe this out,"" he said.

Mr Asher also disputed the claim that only the cleanest and quietest aircraft will fly at Heathrow. ""There is no policy in place which prevents older generation aircraft from being operated out of any airport,"" he said.

As for reducing ""stacking"" - where aircraft wait over an airport to land - Mr Asher said if that's the goal, ""adding more aircraft to the sky won't make this easier"".

Opposition to Back Heathrow's claims also came from Rob Barnstone, founder of the No Third Runway Coalition, which is funded by five local authorities surrounding Heathrow Airport.

He said that regardless of fuel efficiencies or new quieter engines, having the additional 260,000 flights Heathrow has said will be created with an extra runway - in addition to the airport's current cap of 480,000 - would create ""an awful lot of noise"".

""For all the best will in the world, Heathrow is a very, very, very noisy neighbour... When you're adding a quarter of a million additional flights, that's going to create an awful lot of emissions, even if they're using planes that are ever so slightly less environmentally damaging than previous planes,"" Mr Barnstone said.

Green claims

Under the heading of ""UK sustainable fuel industry for Heathrow"", Back Heathrow said ""advances in electric and hydrogen powered aircraft can ensure we meet our environmental targets"".

Elaborating on this, Back Heathrow told Sky News: ""Zero-emission electric and hydrogen aircraft are very much the end goal for civil aviation and countries like Norway have set 2040 as the year that all of their short-haul flights will be by electric planes.""

The statement was called ""incredibly misleading"" by Dr Alex Chapman, senior economist at the left-leaning think tank New Economics Foundation (NEF).

""There's just absolutely no confidence that those aircraft are going to have any meaningful impact on emissions and commercial aviation in any reasonable time frame. And, yeah, we can all speculate as to what may not happen in 50 years' time. But I think the people living around the airport should be given the information about what's actually realistic.""

Even if the technology were available, the runway may not be ready for it, Dr Chapman said.

""Perhaps more importantly, there's been no indication so far that the proposed new runway is being built to cater for those types of aircraft, because a runway that caters to electrical, hydrogen powered aircraft would be very different to one that was for conventional fuel, particularly in terms of the fuelling infrastructure around it that would be required: pipes to pipe hydrogen, massive charging power facilities.""

While work is under way to develop electric aircraft, there are currently no commercial electric flights taking place. The best-case scenario is battery-powered flights that may be suitable for short journeys.

But as a major international airport, more than 40% of Heathrow's flights are long-haul and medium-haul.

And while airlines such as easyJet have called for government funding to develop hydrogen flying suitable for short-haul flights, there are obstacles to making regular commercial flights a reality.

Providing enough hydrogen for the plane journeys from renewable sources will be challenging, as will transporting the fuel, and reworking airport infrastructure for hydrogen refuelling.

Plans for hydrogen aircraft are at least a decade away, with Airbus saying it wants to get a 100-seat hydrogen plane in the air by 2035 - although Back Heathrow's estimates for a third runway have flights taking off in 2034.

For now, rising emissions from flying are risking the UK's climate targets, according to the independent government advisers of the Climate Change Committee, who found flights contribute more greenhouse gas than the entire electricity supply sector.

Expanding at 'full capacity'

On the first page of the newsletter, Back Heathrow says ""Heathrow is at full capacity"", but the company told Sky News the airport has been ""operating at 98% capacity since 2005"".

Despite its 98% capacity, Heathrow Airport has broken passenger number records every year for the past 14 years - excluding the pandemic years of 2020 to 2023.

Dr Chapman said Heathrow is at capacity regarding the government-imposed flight cap, not at the capacity of the current runway infrastructure.

""So if the government were, for example, to lift that cap on the number of aircraft movements, it's pretty likely that they could actually fly 10% to 20% more flights out of the existing infrastructure,"" he said.

As aeroplanes have expanded to carry more passengers, the airport has welcomed more people, he added.

The airport earlier this month announced plans to increase its capacity by 10 million passengers a year, before a third runway is built, and to raise the charge paid by passengers to fund the investment.

How have the group and the airport responded?

A Heathrow spokesperson said: ""Back Heathrow represents tens of thousands of local people who want to make their views known on the importance of Heathrow to their communities and livelihoods today and into the future.

Speaking for the campaign group, Mr Dhanda said: ""At Back Heathrow we are proud of our link to Heathrow Airport (the clue is in the name).","A campaign group for a third runway at Heathrow that gets funding from the airport has been distributing ""incredibly misleading"" information to households in west London, according to opponents of the expansion.

The group, called Back Heathrow, sent leaflets to people living near the airport, claiming expansion could be the route to a ""greener"" airport and suggesting it would mean only the ""cleanest and quietest aircraft"" fly there.

It comes as the airport prepares to submit its planning application for a third runway ahead of the 31 July deadline, following the government's statement of support for the expansion.

Back Heathrow calls itself a ""local campaign group of over 100,000 residents"" and does not mention the funding it receives from the airport in the newsletter.

Its website also does not mention the current financial support and says it ""initially launched with funding from Heathrow Airport but we have since grown"".

Back Heathrow also told Sky News it had ""always been open"" about the support it receives from the airport.

At the bottom of every web page, the organisation says: ""Back Heathrow is a group of residents, businesses and community groups who have come together to defend the jobs that rely on Heathrow and to campaign for its secure future.""

Heathrow Airport said it had always been clear about funding Back Heathrow, but would not disclose how much it provides.

Who's behind Back Heathrow?

The group's executive director is former Labour minister Parmjit Dhanda, who was MP for Gloucester from 2001 to 2010 and sits on the National Policy Forum - the body responsible for developing Labour policy.

Latest accounts for Back Heathrow show it had five employees, including its two directors, in the financial year ending 30 June 2024. The second director is John Braggins, a former campaign adviser to Tony Blair.

The business had £243,961 in cash, the accounts show.

What are the group saying?

In the newsletter, executive director Mr Dhanda said people ask if Heathrow is sustainable. In answering the question, he appeared to suggest the airport can dictate what types of planes use Heathrow.

""We can build a cleaner, greener and smarter airport - using more sustainable aviation fuel, ensuring only the cleanest and quietest aircraft fly here, reduce stacking in our skies and modernise our airspace to cut emissions in flight,"" he wrote.

When asked by Sky News what Back Heathrow meant and what the source for the claim was, the organisation pointed to the airport's traffic light system of noise and emission measurements for the 50 largest airlines serving Heathrow.

""The scheme helps to see what areas certain airlines are excelling in and where improvements can be made,"" a spokesperson said.

But those ""cleaner and greener"" claims were dismissed as ""myths"" by one campaigner.

Finlay Asher is an aerospace engineer and co-founder of Safe Landing, a group of aviation workers and enthusiasts seeking climate improvements in the industry.

He said the emissions savings from sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) were ""highly debatable"" - but added that even if they were taken at face value, use of these fuels is ""relatively low"" and so only provides small emissions reductions.

""Air traffic growth at Heathrow will wipe this out,"" he said.

Mr Asher also disputed the claim that only the cleanest and quietest aircraft will fly at Heathrow. ""There is no policy in place which prevents older generation aircraft from being operated out of any airport,"" he said.

As for reducing ""stacking"" - where aircraft wait over an airport to land - Mr Asher said if that's the goal, ""adding more aircraft to the sky won't make this easier"".

Opposition to Back Heathrow's claims also came from Rob Barnstone, founder of the No Third Runway Coalition, which is funded by five local authorities surrounding Heathrow Airport.

He said that regardless of fuel efficiencies or new quieter engines, having the additional 260,000 flights Heathrow has said will be created with an extra runway - in addition to the airport's current cap of 480,000 - would create ""an awful lot of noise"".

""For all the best will in the world, Heathrow is a very, very, very noisy neighbour... When you're adding a quarter of a million additional flights, that's going to create an awful lot of emissions, even if they're using planes that are ever so slightly less environmentally damaging than previous planes,"" Mr Barnstone said.

Green claims

Under the heading of ""UK sustainable fuel industry for Heathrow"", Back Heathrow said ""advances in electric and hydrogen powered aircraft can ensure we meet our environmental targets"".

Elaborating on this, Back Heathrow told Sky News: ""Zero-emission electric and hydrogen aircraft are very much the end goal for civil aviation and countries like Norway have set 2040 as the year that all of their short-haul flights will be by electric planes.""

The statement was called ""incredibly misleading"" by Dr Alex Chapman, senior economist at the left-leaning think tank New Economics Foundation (NEF).

""There's just absolutely no confidence that those aircraft are going to have any meaningful impact on emissions and commercial aviation in any reasonable time frame. And, yeah, we can all speculate as to what may not happen in 50 years' time. But I think the people living around the airport should be given the information about what's actually realistic.""

Even if the technology were available, the runway may not be ready for it, Dr Chapman said.

""Perhaps more importantly, there's been no indication so far that the proposed new runway is being built to cater for those types of aircraft, because a runway that caters to electrical, hydrogen powered aircraft would be very different to one that was for conventional fuel, particularly in terms of the fuelling infrastructure around it that would be required: pipes to pipe hydrogen, massive charging power facilities.""

While work is under way to develop electric aircraft, there are currently no commercial electric flights taking place. The best-case scenario is battery-powered flights that may be suitable for short journeys.

But as a major international airport, more than 40% of Heathrow's flights are long-haul and medium-haul.

And while airlines such as easyJet have called for government funding to develop hydrogen flying suitable for short-haul flights, there are obstacles to making regular commercial flights a reality.

Providing enough hydrogen for the plane journeys from renewable sources will be challenging, as will transporting the fuel, and reworking airport infrastructure for hydrogen refuelling.

Plans for hydrogen aircraft are at least a decade away, with Airbus saying it wants to get a 100-seat hydrogen plane in the air by 2035 - although Back Heathrow's estimates for a third runway have flights taking off in 2034.

For now, rising emissions from flying are risking the UK's climate targets, according to the independent government advisers of the Climate Change Committee, who found flights contribute more greenhouse gas than the entire electricity supply sector.

Expanding at 'full capacity'

On the first page of the newsletter, Back Heathrow says ""Heathrow is at full capacity"", but the company told Sky News the airport has been ""operating at 98% capacity since 2005"".

Despite its 98% capacity, Heathrow Airport has broken passenger number records every year for the past 14 years - excluding the pandemic years of 2020 to 2023.

Dr Chapman said Heathrow is at capacity regarding the government-imposed flight cap, not at the capacity of the current runway infrastructure.

""So if the government were, for example, to lift that cap on the number of aircraft movements, it's pretty likely that they could actually fly 10% to 20% more flights out of the existing infrastructure,"" he said.

As aeroplanes have expanded to carry more passengers, the airport has welcomed more people, he added.

The airport earlier this month announced plans to increase its capacity by 10 million passengers a year, before a third runway is built, and to raise the charge paid by passengers to fund the investment.

The electrolyser converts carbon dioxide and water into precursors that can then ultimately be turned into green fuel for aircraft.

The funding from TRaCE, the Trailblazer for Recycling and Clean Energy program established by the Australian Department of Education, has been boosted by industry partners to total $4.2 million, with the aim of achieving a critical breakthrough in the reduction of emissions in aviation.

The UNSW-led project, involving Dr Rahman Daiyan, Scientia Professor Rose Amal, and adjunct Professor Jimmy Yun, will work in association with Australian partner Tjindu Power and Chuangqi Times (Qingdao) Technology Company, a clean tech developer based in China.

The team have already developed a carbon dioxide electrolyser system using low-cost transition metal and carbon catalysts, which can be integrated with the well-established Fischer-Tropsch process to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

Decarbonising aviation is one of the toughest challenges in the race to net zero. Unlike cars or homes, planes can’t easily switch to be electrified and the fuels they burn release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Globally, aviation accounts for about 2-3% of emissions, but it’s a fast-growing sector with limited alternatives. Many emerging clean energy technologies aim to replace fossil fuel production with sustainable aviation fuels and e-fuels but these solutions are still expensive, energy-intensive, and not yet ready for mass deployment.

“Our goal is to revolutionise how we produce clean fuels for aviation, using renewable energy to transform CO₂ into usable fuels without requiring costly infrastructure changes. This technology could be the key to decarbonising aviation, one of the world’s most challenging sectors,” said Dr Daiyan, a Scientia Fellow in the School of Mineral and Energy Resources Engineering, and Lead Chief Investigator at UNSW.

Scientia Prof. Amal, from the School of Chemical Engineering, added: “This breakthrough proves that with smart catalyst design and integrated system thinking, we can transform waste CO₂ into the very fuels that drive our economy. It’s the kind of scalable innovation we need to tackle hard-to-abate sectors and achieve net zero.”

The grant from TRaCE will help to move the technology from TRL 4 (proof-of-concept in the lab) to TRL 6 (validated prototype in a relevant environment).

A spin-out company, Gurung Fuel, led by the industry partners, has been created to lead commercialisation, stakeholder engagement, and capital raising.

“This partnership is a major step towards scaling the cutting-edge electrolyser technology. We’re not just developing a solution, we are creating a game-changer for the aviation industry, with the potential to make a global impact,” said Prof. Yun from Chuangqi Times (Qingdao).

The research project is a strategic opportunity for Australia, which is facing a critical challenge in its fuel security.

Currently, the nation holds only 48 days’ worth of fuel reserves – far below the 90 days required by international standards. The nation’s heavy reliance on imported fuel also makes it vulnerable to global disruptions and recent geopolitical crises have underscored the urgent need for a sustainable and self-sufficient solution.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_9829-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 23:56:22.022866

Společnost DSV pokračuje ve své strategii snižování emisí v dopravě a rozšiřuje využití alternativních paliv. Kromě elektrifikace své globální flotily a úspěšného nasazení vozidel na HVO (hydrogenovaný rostlinný olej) se zaměřuje také na další biopaliva, jako je SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) pro leteckou a FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters) pro námořní přepravu. Udržitelná logistika zůstává prioritou i ve druhé polovině roku 2025. Předpokládá se také další rozšíření využití umělé inteligence, přičemž společnost DSV zároveň klade důraz na přizpůsobení se globálním změnám v obchodních podmínkách, jako je vliv nových celních opatření, nevyjasněná situace v Rudém moři či přesouvání dodavatelských řetězců do blízkých zemí neboli nearshoring.

Společnost DSV se přizpůsobuje rostoucímu důrazu na ESG standardy (měřítka pro hodnocení a porovnávání udržitelnosti firem v oblasti životního prostředí, sociální odpovědnosti a správy). Zákazníci stále více požadují transparentní informace o environmentálním dopadu přepravy a upřednostňují nízkoemisní řešení. Jedním z nízkoemisních řešeních, které DSV Česká republika již několik měsíců provozuje, jsou velkokapacitní soupravy na HVO a plánuje rozšíření využití tohoto paliva na další trasy.

5 měsíců zkušeností s HVO

„Pokračujeme ve využívání alternativního paliva HVO na nočních hlavních distribučních linkách DSV v CZ s cílem přispět ke snížení emisí CO2 z provozu nákladních vozidel. Díky velké části zákazníků DSV, kteří nepatrnou částkou tzv. environmentálního příplatku nám pomáhají společně se podílet na šetrnějším způsobu přepravy, jsme za 5 měsíců uspořili 190 tis. kg CO2, ekvivalent této hmotnosti je cca 29 slonů. Po tuto dobu jsme společně s našimi dopravci hledali optimální řešení pro rozšíření použití HVO paliva i pro další dálkové linky DSV v ČR. Pokud nám to dovolí pomalu se zlepšující situace v oblasti přeprav, tak pro 2.polovinu roku 2025 jsme odhodlaní pokrýt až 80% tuzemských linek DSV tímto palivem. Dosáhli bychom tak měsíční úspory kolem 10 slonů (cca 66,6 tis. kg) CO2. V současné době se v DSV CZ připravujeme na provoz čistě elektrických tahačů Volvo pro provoz v dedikovaném nastavení pro významného klienta. To by mělo být dalším konkrétním přispěním DSV k modernímu pojetí příměstské a vnitrostátní logistice. Jsme přesvědčeni o správnosti přístupu využitím širší škály úsporných vozidel a alternativních pohonů, které mohou ve vhodné kombinaci posunout přepravní logistiku směrem ke skutečné dlouhodobé udržitelnosti s přímým dopadem na lepší životní prostředí nás všech,“ říká Petr Chocholatý, ředitel provozu DSV Road Česká republika.

HVO se osvědčilo jako efektivní alternativa tam, kde zatím není dostatečná infrastruktura pro elektro vozy. Česká síť čerpacích stanic s HVO se navíc rozrůstá rychleji než síť elektro stanic pro nákladní dopravu, což z něj činí realistické řešení pro každodenní využití. Na rozdíl od tradičních fosilních paliv, jako je nafta, mají udržitelná paliva podobné provozní vlastnosti, ale výrazně nižší uhlíkovou stopu. Vyrábějí se z biologicky odbouratelných nebo odpadních surovin a jejich použití snižuje nejen přímé emise CO₂, ale také celkové dopady na životní prostředí, které jsou spojeny s těžbou a zpracováním ropy.

„I když jsou provozní náklady spojené s HVO výrazně vyšší než u dieselových tahačů, palivo se v našich podmínkách osvědčilo jako spolehlivé, efektivní a ekologické řešení – zejména tam, kde zatím není možné nebo ekonomicky výhodné nasadit elektrická vozidla. Rozšíření na další trasy a podpora budování infrastruktury jsou přirozeným krokem, který nám pomáhá naplňovat naše emisní cíle,“ dodává pan Chocholatý.

Redukce emisí i u letecké a námořní dopravy

Na globální úrovni se DSV stále intenzivněji zapojuje do projektů snižování emisí také v oblasti letecké a námořní dopravy. V letectví sleduje vývoj SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel – udržitelné letecké palivo), které může snížit emise CO₂ až o 80 % oproti konvenčnímu kerosinu (standardně využívané letecké palivo). SAF se vyrábí z obnovitelných zdrojů, jako jsou biologické odpady, použité oleje nebo zemědělské zbytky, a je přímo použitelný v současných letadlech bez nutnosti technických úprav. DSV již v roce 2023 uskutečnilo iniciativu, kdy se rozhodlo absolvovat veškeré své služební lety výhradně s využitím biopaliva SAF. Podobně se v námořní dopravě otevírá prostor pro FAME – biopalivo druhé generace, jehož využití je ve fázi pilotního nasazení.

Co očekávat ve druhé polovině roku 2025

Logistický sektor bude ve druhé polovině roku 2025 čelit několika dalším klíčovým výzvám i příležitostem. Jednou z nich je stále pokračující rozvoj digitalizace a umělé inteligence v logistice. Tyto technologie se stávají klíčovými nástroji pro zvyšování efektivity. Umělá inteligence umožní nejen prediktivní modely pro optimalizaci tras a snížení nákladů, ale také sledování přepravy v reálném čase, což pomůže lépe reagovat na aktuální podmínky a optimalizovat logistické procesy. AI dokáže pomáhat i v oblasti bezpečnosti. Například pro monitoring chování řidičů, což umožní včasné upozornění na rizikové chování a přispěje k zajištění většího bezpečí na cestách. Dále bude pokračovat nasazování autonomních strojů ve skladech, které zvýší produktivitu a flexibilitu, a zároveň minimalizují lidskou chybu v náročných skladovacích procesech.

„Věříme, že nám všechny tyto kroky pomohou ke splnění globálního cíle pro rok 2025, kterým je snížení emisí z přepravních a logistických činností o 8 %. Tento cíl je součástí širší strategie postupné dekarbonizace, která zahrnuje investice do alternativních paliv, elektrifikaci vozového parku a spolupráci s partnery na ekologických řešeních napříč celým dodavatelským řetězcem. Skrze tyto dílčí kroky bychom měli do roku 2050 naplnit náš závazek k dosažení nulových emisí – a to jak v rámci vlastního provozu, tak i napříč celým hodnotovým řetězcem,“ dodává pan Chocholatý.

Situace na mezinárodní scéně

Důležité zůstává dění v Suezském průplavu, kde začátkem května došlo k uzavření příměří mezi jemenskými povstalci Húthíi a americkou vládou, která na Húthíjské jednotky podnikla od března letošního roku několik masivních útoků. Dohoda stanovuje, že strany na sebe nebudou v Rudém moři a úžině Báb Al-Mandab vzájemně útočit, což by mělo zajistit svobodu plavby a plynulou mezinárodní námořní dopravu. Příměří by se však nemělo vztahovat na útoky proti Izraeli. “V druhé polovině roku 2025 očekáváme, že tato situace přinese stabilizaci obchodních tras, ale zůstávají obavy o možné eskalace napětí v jiných částech regionu. Vliv této dohody na globální logistiku může být zásadní, zejména vzhledem k pokračujícímu napětí v širším Blízkém východě a rostoucí dynamice geopolitických vztahů, zejména mezi USA, Íránem a Izraelem. Hormuzský průliv je strategická úžina spojující Perský záliv s Arabským mořem, zůstává sice otevřený, ale je pod zvýšeným bezpečnostním dohledem a tlakem. Vzhledem k rostoucímu riziku eskalace konfliktu začínají rejdařské společnosti přehodnocovat své trasy a aktivovat krizové plány. Některé společnosti se z opatrnosti vyhýbají plavbě v Rudém moři, Perském zálivu a právě v Hormuzském průlivu. Neustále sledujeme vývoj situace a v případě nutnosti okamžitě zavádíme opatření, která zajistí co nejvyšší bezpečnost a omezí případné dopady na minimum,“ dodává Jukl.

Dalším faktorem, který bude nutné sledovat, jsou kroky americké vlády v oblasti celní politiky, jež mají za cíl chránit domácí trh. Tato nepředvídatelná a dynamická situace vytváří pro logistické společnosti a obchodníky značné výzvy, zejména kvůli nejistotě, rostoucím nákladům a administrativnímu zatížení. Nejvíce se o amerických clech diskutuje v souvislosti s Čínou, odkud dováží výrobky větší i menší mezinárodní obchodní hráči. Nejasná celní politika může vést k přesouvání dodavatelských řetězců mimo Čínu a posílení nearshoring, tedy přesun výroby blíže k evropským trhům. To by mohlo znamenat zvýšenou poptávku po logistických službách v Evropě. „Stále více našich zákazníků přesouvá výrobu blíže k evropským trhům. Nearshoring výrazně zkracuje dodací lhůty, snižuje rizika a zvyšuje flexibilitu dodavatelských řetězců,“ uvádí Jiří Moravec, ředitel oddělení Sales & Marketing, DSV Air & Sea.

For long-term investors, SIA's governance renaissance under Ms. Goh's leadership offers a compelling case.
In an industry where governance can make or break resilience, Singapore Airlines' transformation under Goh Swee Chen is a testament to the power of strategic oversight.","The aviation sector, long characterized by volatile market conditions and regulatory scrutiny, has seen a quiet revolution in corporate governance. At the forefront of this transformation is Singapore Airlines (SIA), a global aviation icon, which has recently restructured its board to align with evolving investor expectations. Central to this shift is the appointment of Goh Swee Chen as Lead Independent Director in 2019, a move that has catalyzed a strategic reorientation in board oversight, corporate accountability, and long-term value creation. For investors, this evolution presents a compelling case for reassessing SIA's governance framework and its implications for shareholder returns.

A Governance Overhaul: From Shell to the Skies

Goh Swee Chen's appointment was no accident. With a 16-year tenure as Chairperson of Shell Companies in Singapore and a career spanning multinational giants like Procter & Gamble and IBM, she brought a rare blend of operational rigor and cross-sector expertise. Her global experience—across markets such as China, the Netherlands, and the U.S.—provided her with a nuanced understanding of corporate governance in complex, regulated industries. This background proved invaluable for SIA, which, post-pandemic, faced the dual challenges of financial recovery and sustainability-driven transformation.

As Lead Independent Director, Ms. Goh chairs the Board Nominating Committee and sits on the Audit and Customer Experience, Technology, and Sustainability Committees. Her leadership has prioritized three pillars: board diversity, sustainability integration, and stakeholder-centric governance. For instance, under her stewardship, SIA has strengthened its ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) disclosures, a critical factor in today's ESG-driven markets.

ESG and Investor Confidence: A Data-Driven Perspective

SIA's ESG performance, as measured by S&P Global's Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA), reflects this strategic pivot. As of July 2025, SIA holds an ESG score of 51 out of 100, up from a pre-2023 score of 39. While still below the industry's top performers (which average 62), this upward trajectory is significant. The airline's 85% disclosure rate on CSA Required Public Data—a metric that evaluates transparency in ESG practices—suggests a commitment to accountability.

Ms. Goh's influence is evident in SIA's sustainability initiatives. The airline's 2024 partnership with Aether Fuels for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and its $1.1 billion Airbus A350 retrofit program are directly aligned with her committee's focus on decarbonization. These moves not only address regulatory pressures but also cater to a growing cohort of ESG-conscious investors.

Strategic Oversight and Shareholder Value

The question remains: How does this governance evolution translate to shareholder value? While SIA's stock price remains below pre-pandemic levels (trading at ~S$7.00 as of July 2025, compared to ~S$10 in 2019), the airline's capital structure tells a different story. Post-2023, SIA has prioritized conservative debt management and strategic reinvestment, with a focus on technology and customer experience. The $45 million investment in Changi Terminal 2 lounges and the AI-driven customer service overhaul (via OpenAI partnerships) signal a long-term vision to retain premium customers in a competitive market.

Moreover, Ms. Goh's emphasis on board diversity—evidenced by her role in the Council for Board Diversity—has likely enhanced decision-making quality. A 2024 study by the Singapore Institute of Directors found that companies with diverse boards outperformed peers by 12% in ROE over a five-year period. For SIA, this could mean a gradual but sustainable return to profitability as recovery gains momentum.

Risks and Considerations

Investors should not ignore the challenges. The aviation sector remains cyclical, and SIA's reliance on high-yield premium routes exposes it to geopolitical and economic shocks. Additionally, while ESG scores are improving, SIA's 31/49 score on CSA Required Public Data (a subset of the overall ESG score) indicates room for improvement in areas like carbon offsetting and labor practices.

However, Ms. Goh's track record in navigating complex transitions—such as Shell's shift to renewable energy—suggests a board capable of addressing these headwinds. Her dual roles on the Monetary Authority of Singapore's board and JTC Corporation's sustainability committees further reinforce her ability to align SIA's strategy with national economic goals.

Investment Thesis: Buy or Hold?

For long-term investors, SIA's governance renaissance under Ms. Goh's leadership offers a compelling case. The airline's focus on ESG, technological innovation, and board accountability aligns with global trends that are likely to drive institutional investor interest. While the stock's current valuation (~10x trailing earnings) reflects caution, the company's balance sheet strength and strategic clarity position it for a recovery in 2026–2027.

Recommendation: A ""Hold"" for now, with a target price of S$8.50 by mid-2026. Investors should monitor SIA's Q3 2025 ESG report and its 2026 capital allocation decisions for signs of accelerated value creation.

In an industry where governance can make or break resilience, Singapore Airlines' transformation under Goh Swee Chen is a testament to the power of strategic oversight.

Nhiên liệu này do Synhelion – công ty công nghệ sạch tiên phong có trụ sở tại Thụy Sĩ – phát triển, đánh dấu một cột mốc quan trọng trong nỗ lực giảm phát thải và thúc đẩy nền kinh tế khử carbon trong lĩnh vực vận tải hàng không.

Cột mốc đầu tiên: 190 lít nhiên liệu mặt trời đưa vào hệ thống của SWISS

Lô nhiên liệu đầu tiên, gồm 190 lít dầu thô tổng hợp, đã được sản xuất tại cơ sở DAWN của Synhelion và chuyển đến một nhà máy lọc dầu ở miền Bắc Đức.

Tại đây, dầu thô được tinh chế thành nhiên liệu Jet-A-1 – tiêu chuẩn quốc tế cho nhiên liệu hàng không. Nhiên liệu sau đó được bơm vào hệ thống tiếp nhiên liệu của SWISS tại sân bay Hamburg.

Mặc dù lượng nhiên liệu mới chỉ đáp ứng khoảng 7% nhu cầu cho một chuyến bay Hamburg–Zurich, sự kiện này vẫn mang tính biểu tượng mạnh mẽ.

Nó chứng minh rằng công nghệ sản xuất nhiên liệu mặt trời có thể hòa nhập liền mạch với cơ sở hạ tầng và chuỗi cung ứng hiện có – yếu tố then chốt để mở rộng quy mô sản xuất toàn cầu trong tương lai.

“Đây là lần đầu tiên nhiên liệu mặt trời được sử dụng trong hàng không dân dụng. Chúng tôi rất tự hào khi đóng vai trò tiên phong cùng Synhelion trong việc biến công nghệ này thành hiện thực”, Jens Fehlinger – CEO SWISS – nhấn mạnh.

Synhelion và tham vọng tái định hình ngành năng lượng

Synhelion phát triển công nghệ sử dụng bức xạ mặt trời để sản xuất dầu thô tổng hợp, từ đó tinh chế thành nhiên liệu hàng không. Điểm nổi bật của công nghệ này là khả năng giảm mạnh lượng khí thải CO₂ so với dầu hỏa truyền thống, đồng thời tận dụng nguồn năng lượng vô tận từ mặt trời.

Đánh giá vòng đời (LCA) do tổ chức độc lập thực hiện cho thấy nhiên liệu từ cơ sở DAWN có thể giảm phát thải khí nhà kính vượt xa mức 70% theo yêu cầu của Chỉ thị Năng lượng Tái tạo của EU.

Philipp Furler, đồng sáng lập kiêm CEO Synhelion, cho biết: “Lô nhiên liệu đầu tiên chỉ mang tính biểu tượng, nhưng nó là bằng chứng rõ ràng cho thấy chúng tôi đã sẵn sàng bước sang giai đoạn mở rộng quy mô toàn cầu. Chúng tôi trân trọng sự hợp tác bền chặt với SWISS và Tập đoàn Lufthansa trong hành trình này.”

Lộ trình mở rộng: Từ thử nghiệm đến thương mại hóa năm 2027

Hiện Synhelion và SWISS đang xúc tiến chứng nhận bền vững theo tiêu chuẩn EU, đồng thời đầu tư vào cơ sở sản xuất lớn hơn. Mục tiêu là thương mại hóa nhiên liệu mặt trời vào năm 2027, đáp ứng nhu cầu ngày càng tăng của ngành hàng không.

SWISS đã trở thành đối tác chiến lược của Synhelion từ năm 2020 và chính thức đầu tư từ năm 2022. Việc đồng hành từ sớm giúp hãng bay này không chỉ tiếp cận công nghệ tiên phong mà còn đóng góp vào quá trình định hình tương lai của nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững (SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

Lufthansa và chiến lược SAF dài hạn

Với vai trò thành viên Tập đoàn Lufthansa, SWISS được thừa hưởng mạng lưới nghiên cứu và kinh nghiệm hàng chục năm trong lĩnh vực SAF. Lufthansa đã ký kết nhiều hợp đồng mua nhiên liệu dài hạn, tham gia liên minh ngành và triển khai các dự án thử nghiệm nhằm tạo động lực cho thị trường toàn cầu.

While the airline framed these cuts as part of a “finalized schedule” set 100 days in advance, the move exposed deeper vulnerabilities: a legal battle with Chicago over gate access, staffing shortages, and shifting demand patterns. For investors, this episode is not just a blip but a window into the broader challenges and opportunities facing the post-pandemic airline sector.

Operational Disruptions and Gate Wars: A Recipe for Short-Term Pain

O'Hare, one of the world's busiest airports, has long been a linchpin for American Airlines' transcontinental and international operations. The August cuts—most severe on routes to Phoenix, Detroit, and Newark—were partly attributed to a lawsuit against Chicago officials, who allegedly violated a 2018 agreement by granting United Airlines five additional gates. American's potential loss of four gates at ORD could limit its ability to scale operations during peak travel periods.

Such gate constraints, combined with staffing shortages and weather-related disruptions (storms at hubs like Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago spiked operational issues by 36% year-over-year in Q2 2025), forced American to reduce capacity. While the airline claims these cuts were pre-announced in May, passengers and investors alike perceive them as reactive. The result? Reduced availability on key routes, higher fares for remaining flights, and a dent in customer trust.

Profitability Under Pressure: A Tale of Two Margins

American's Q2 2025 financials reveal a mixed picture. Revenue hit a record $14.4 billion, driven by strong leisure demand and premium cabin performance. Yet operating margins contracted to 8%, down from previous quarters, as operational disruptions inflated costs. Fuel prices fell to $86/barrel in 2025 (vs. $99 in 2024), but this relief was offset by $38 billion in total debt and a $29 billion net debt load.

The airline's liquidity—$12 billion in available cash and credit—offers a buffer, but its free cash flow ($791 million in Q2) pales against the $25 billion in annual fuel costs. For context, the industry's net profit margin in 2025 is projected at 3.7%, with American's 8% margin appearing robust in isolation but fragile against macroeconomic headwinds. Rising interest rates and potential rate hikes could further strain its debt-heavy balance sheet.

Broader Industry Trends: A Post-Pandemic Paradox

American's struggles mirror a sector-wide recalibration. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts $36 billion in global airline profits for 2025, up from $32.4 billion in 2024, but this growth is tempered by supply chain bottlenecks, a 17,000-aircraft backlog, and rising costs for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Meanwhile, demand remains resilient: 4.99 billion travelers are expected in 2025, but yields are declining as airlines compete for a shrinking pool of premium customers.

The August flight reductions by American, United, JetBlue, and Avelo highlight a strategic shift toward leaner networks. Airlines are prioritizing high-demand routes over low-yield corridors, a move that could stabilize margins but risks alienating business and leisure travelers accustomed to frequent departures. For investors, this signals a sector prioritizing efficiency over growth—a trend that may persist through 2026.

Investor Sentiment: Between Resilience and Skepticism

American's stock price dropped 7.85% in pre-market trading after its Q2 earnings report, despite beating EPS estimates by 21.79%. The disconnect underscores investor wariness: while revenue and liquidity are strong, operational volatility and legal disputes cast doubt on long-term stability. The airline's 16.5% increase in weekly flights at O'Hare for August—a response to added routes like Naples and Mexico City—may offset some cuts, but the broader message is clear: flexibility is now a premium commodity.

The Road Ahead: Strategic Moves in a Fragile Environment

American's bet on new destinations (e.g., Naples, Queretaro) and expanded services to popular leisure markets could drive long-term growth. Its 6.7% year-over-year increase in AAdvantage credit card spending and 7% rise in active loyalty accounts suggest a strong value proposition for premium customers. However, the airline must navigate near-term risks:

1. Gate Access: Resolving the Chicago legal dispute is critical to regaining operational flexibility at O'Hare.

2. Debt Management: With $38 billion in total debt, American must balance fleet modernization with cost control.

3. Sustainability Costs: As SAF becomes a regulatory imperative, its 4.2x price premium over jet fuel could erode margins.

Investment Thesis: A Cautious Bull Case

For investors, American Airlines represents a high-conviction opportunity in a sector transitioning from crisis to equilibrium. Its strong liquidity, strategic route additions, and focus on premium services position it to outperform peers in 2026. However, the airline's reliance on O'Hare and its debt load warrant caution. A buy recommendation is justified for those comfortable with a 12–18-month time horizon and a 15–20% margin of safety.

In the end, American's story is emblematic of the airline industry's post-pandemic journey: a mix of resilience, reinvention, and relentless adaptation to forces beyond its control. For now, the skies remain bumpy—but not without promise.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-26 14:56:45.149405

For those willing to endure short-term volatility, the stock offers a unique opportunity to capitalize on the renewable fuels revolution.","The recent downgrade of Darling Ingredients (DAR) by Baird analyst Ben Kallo from “Outperform” to “Neutral” has sparked debate among investors. While the move reflects short-term headwinds in the renewable fuels and RIN markets, a deeper analysis reveals a compelling case for contrarian value investors to consider the stock's long-term potential. This article examines how regulatory tailwinds, strategic diversification, and undervaluation metrics could position DAR for a rebound, despite current challenges.

Short-Term Headwinds: A Cautionary Lens

The downgrade was triggered by Darling's Q2 2025 earnings shortfall ($0.08 vs. $0.30 expected) and revenue miss ($1.48B vs. $1.49B expected). Key concerns include:

- Regulatory Uncertainty: Ongoing debates over small refiner exemptions under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) have created ambiguity in the RIN market, a critical revenue driver for Darling's fuel segment.

- Margin Compression: Weakness in Renewable Identification Number (RIN) pricing and declining DGD EBITDA (a 10% drop year-over-year) have eroded near-term profitability.

- Strategic Visibility: Analysts cite limited clarity on how policy shifts and market dynamics will impact Darling's 2025 guidance.

Long-Term Strategic Positioning: A Contrarian Case

Despite these challenges, Darling's long-term fundamentals align with growing demand for sustainable solutions. Three pillars underpin its strategic resilience:

1. Renewable Fuels Leadership: Darling remains a key player in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and biodiesel production. The proposed Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) framework and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) reforms are expected to bolster demand for low-carbon fuels, creating a tailwind for the company's core business.

2. Diversification into High-Margin Sectors: The formation of NexTata, a joint venture in the health and wellness space, targets high-growth markets like collagen and gelatin. Early results show strong repeat orders, signaling potential for recurring revenue streams.

3. Regulatory Tailwinds: Rising U.S. fat prices, driven by policy incentives and tariffs, and the anticipated resolution of SRE issues could normalize margins in the renewable fuels sector.

Valuation Metrics: A Contrarian's Edge

Darling's valuation appears attractive when viewed through a contrarian lens:

- Price-to-Book (P/B): At 1.22, the company trades at a 34% discount to its industry average of 1.99, suggesting undervaluation relative to tangible assets.

- Price-to-Cash Flow (P/CF): A ratio of 8.93, well below the industry average of 14.67, indicates strong cash flow generation despite earnings volatility.

- Analyst Consensus: A 14-analyst average price target of $48.95 implies a 39% upside from current levels, with six firms maintaining “Outperform” or “Strong Buy” ratings.

However, investors must weigh these metrics against the company's high leverage (debt-to-EBITDA of 5.04) and a beta of 1.23, reflecting above-market volatility.

Regulatory-Driven Growth: The Irrefutable Tailwind

The renewable fuels sector is on the cusp of structural growth. Policy frameworks like the RVO and LCFS are designed to reduce carbon intensity, creating a $100+ billion market for SAF and biofuels by 2030. Darling's expertise in feedstock processing and its partnerships (e.g., Diamond Green Diesel) position it to capture a significant share of this growth.

Investment Thesis: Balancing Risks and Rewards

For contrarian value investors, the Baird downgrade presents an opportunity to buy into a company with strong long-term fundamentals at a discount. Key risks include:

- Regulatory Delays: Prolonged uncertainty around RFS exemptions or LCFS adjustments could delay margin recovery.

- Market Volatility: The stock's beta of 1.23 suggests sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts, such as interest rate hikes or energy price swings.

However, the potential rewards are substantial:

- Margin Expansion: A resolution of RIN market dynamics and SRE issues could normalize margins, driving EBITDA growth.

- Strategic Diversification: NexTata's entry into the health and wellness sector offers a hedge against fuel market volatility.

Conclusion: A Calculated Bet for Long-Term Investors

While the Baird downgrade underscores near-term challenges, it also creates a compelling entry point for investors focused on long-term value. Darling's strategic alignment with regulatory trends, undervalued metrics, and diversification into high-margin sectors justify a cautious bullish stance.

Parler de transition verte dans le domaine aérien peut sembler être un ""jeu réservé aux riches"", tant les coûts engagés sont élevés. Pourtant, l’aviation vietnamienne poursuit avec détermination sa trajectoire ""verte"", portée par l’esprit de ""Transformation, sacrifices et développement durable"".

Un mouvement mondial irréversible

Le monde traverse actuellement une période de transition énergétique marquée par des bouleversements et des incertitudes. Les politiques climatiques internationales ne sont pas toujours cohérentes.

À titre d’exemple, les États-Unis, sous la présidence de Donald Trump, se sont officiellement retirés de l’Accord de Paris sur le climat.

Cependant, dans un apparent paradoxe, les États-Unis ont continué de participer à des mécanismes techniques spécifiques, tels que le dispositif de compensation et de réduction des émissions de carbone pour l’aviation internationale (CORSIA) mis en place par l’Organisation de l’aviation civile internationale (OACI). Par ailleurs, les subventions à la recherche et au développement de carburants durables pour l’aviation (connus sous le nom de SAF - Sustainable Aviation Fuel) n’ont jamais cessé, ce qui démontre une orientation technologique et économique désormais difficilement réversible, transcendant les fluctuations politiques de court terme.

Dans ce contexte, le Vietnam affirme pleinement son engagement en tant que membre responsable de la communauté internationale.

L’engagement ferme du Vietnam pris dans le cadre de la 26e Conférence des Parties à la Convention-cadre des Nations unies sur les changements climatiques (COP26), qui consiste à atteindre la neutralité carbone (Net Zéro) d’ici 2050, constitue une déclaration politique décisive, permettant de redéfinir la stratégie de développement national.

Cet engagement ne se limite pas à une simple annonce, il se traduit progressivement en stratégies, plans et actions concrètes dans tous les domaines, sous la direction énergique du Parti et du gouvernement.

Plus récemment, dans son message politique émis lors du Sommet du partenariat pour la croissance verte et les objectifs mondiaux 2030 (P4G) tenu au Vietnam, le secrétaire général du Parti communiste du Vietnam, Tô Lâm, a réaffirmé la vision stratégique du pays dans la construction de trois piliers fondamentaux pour une croissance verte, que sont : des institutions vertes comme fondement, des technologies vertes comme moteur de percée, et des ressources humaines vertes comme facteur clé.

Cette vision sert de boussole pour l’ensemble du processus de transition, dans lequel le secteur de l’aviation joue un rôle important.

Vers l’objectif de 30% des émissions de carbone

Un fait méconnu est que la transition verte du secteur aérien vietnamien ne commence pas seulement avec l'apparition des termes tels que CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation - régime de compensation et de réduction de carbone pour l'aviation internationale) ou SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel - carburants d'aviation durables).

Photo : CTV/CVN

Au contraire, ce secteur a déjà connu une première phase de transition s’étalant sur plusieurs années, une démarche discrète mais extrêmement efficace en faveur de la réduction des émissions de carbone.

Le principal moteur de cette phase réside dans les choix commerciaux et l’optimisation des opérations, où les exigences de sécurité et de sûreté aérienne doivent aller de pair avec les avantages économiques et environnementaux.

Cette période a créé un ""tremplin"" de réduction des émissions important, tout en démontrant les capacités technologiques et de gestion du secteur. Cependant, le succès de cette phase ""gagnant-gagnant"" pourrait involontairement masquer les énormes défis financiers et technologiques de la phase suivante, une phase qui exigera des investissements directs et le sacrifice des bénéfices immédiats.

L'une des solutions les plus efficaces pour réduire les émissions est d'investir dans de nouvelles générations d'avions, plus économes en carburant et plus respectueux de l'environnement. Les compagnies aériennes vietnamiennes ont été très proactives à cet égard, considérant cela comme une double décision stratégique, car cela améliore leur compétitivité et leur permet d’assumer leur responsabilité environnementale.

Vietnam Airlines, en tant que compagnie aérienne nationale, a été pionnière dans l'investissement dans les dernières générations d'avions gros-porteurs.

Elle est devenue l'une des premières compagnies de la région Asie-Pacifique à exploiter simultanément les deux types d'avions modernes, le Boeing 787 Dreamliner et l'Airbus A350 XWB.

Ces avions offrent non seulement une meilleure expérience de vol aux passagers, mais ont également une consommation de carburant inférieure de 25% par rapport aux générations précédentes, réduisant directement une grande quantité d'émissions de CO2.

Pendant ce temps, Vietjet Air s'est concentrée sur l'optimisation de sa flotte d'avions monocouloirs avec l'Airbus A321neo.

Il est considéré comme l'un des modèles d'avions à couloir unique les plus efficaces au monde, capable de réduire plus de 5.000 tonnes d'émissions de CO2 par an et par avion et de réduire le bruit de 50% par rapport aux avions de l'ancienne génération.

L’adoption des moteurs GTF de Pratt & Whitney pour la flotte d’A321neo permet à la compagnie d'économiser de l’ordre de 15 - 17% de carburant, contribuant ainsi de manière significative à sa stratégie de développement durable et à l’objectif national de neutralité carbone d’ici 2050.

Parallèlement au renouvellement de la flotte, une véritable révolution dans la gestion du trafic aérien a été mise en œuvre de manière efficace, à travers une modernisation du contrôle aérien et l’optimisation des opérations aéroportuaires, conformément à la feuille de route technologique de l’OACI (Organisation de l'aviation civile mondiale).

L’application de la navigation basée sur les performances (Performance-Based Navigation - PBN) permet aux avions de suivre des trajectoires optimisées grâce aux systèmes de navigation par satellite, au lieu de suivre des itinéraires fixes basés sur des stations de navigation au sol.

Cette évolution permet de raccourcir les distances de vol, de réduire le temps de vol, et donc de diminuer la consommation de carburant et les émissions polluantes.

Consolider le réseau aérien national

Le Vietnam a élaboré une feuille de route et met actuellement en œuvre le PBN dans l’ensemble des 22 aéroports du pays, dans le but de renforcer les capacités et l’efficacité du réseau aérien national.

Par ailleurs, Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) est une plateforme numérique permettant aux différentes parties prenantes opérant dans les aéroports (exploitants aéroportuaires, services de contrôle aérien, compagnies aériennes, prestataires de services au sol) de partager les informations et de prendre des décisions en temps réel.

Photo : VNAirlines

La mise en œuvre réussie de l’A-CDM dans les deux plus grands aéroports du pays, à savoir Nôi Bài et Tân Son Nhât, a connu des résultats concrets.

Les essais à l’aéroport de Nôi Bài ont montré que le taux de ponctualité des vols (On-Time Performance - OTP) a atteint 94%, tandis que le temps de roulage en attente sur la piste a été considérablement réduit, ce qui a permis d’atténuer les embouteillages, d’économiser de carburants et de réduire directement les émissions de CO₂.

Sur la base des normes et analyses internationales en matière d’aviation, on peut estimer que la combinaison des efforts de modernisation de la flotte et d’optimisation de la gestion du trafic aérien au cours de la dernière décennie a permis à l’aviation vietnamienne de réduire d’environ 30% ses émissions de CO₂ par unité de transport.

En d’autres termes, pour transporter un passager sur une distance d’un kilomètre, la quantité de CO₂ émise a diminué d’environ 30% par rapport au scénario où les technologies des années 2000 auraient été maintenues.

Ce chiffre représente non seulement une performance environnementale remarquable, mais surtout, il illustre la capacité du secteur aérien vietnamien à bâtir une base technologique solide et une maîtrise opérationnelle durable. C’est cet acquis qui constitue un socle stratégique et un avantage compétitif essentiel, permettant au Vietnam d’aborder avec confiance la prochaine étape de la transition verte - une étape pleine de défis, mais aussi riche en opportunités.

Un nouvel horizon : le CORSIA et la révolution du carburant d’aviation durable

Si la première phase de la transition verte était principalement motivée par les impératifs de sûreté, de sécurité aérienne et de rentabilité économique interne, la phase actuelle marque un tournant fondamental : on passe d’une ""transition volontaire"" à une ""transition dictée par les normes internationales"".

L’attention du public et la pression réglementaire ne se sont véritablement intensifiées qu’avec l’émergence de deux concepts clés : le CORSIA et le SAF.

Ils constituent la partie émergée de l’iceberg, là où les engagements nationaux doivent désormais se traduire en actions concrètes et coûteuses.

Le secteur aéronautique du Vietnam et les initiatives de décarbonation

L’internalisation proactive des réglementations du Vietnam et sa participation précoce à ces mécanismes ne constituent pas une action passive, mais une démarche stratégique, démontrant une vision visant à transformer des pressions en une opportunité de restructurer l’industrie aéronautique, d’améliorer la compétitivité et d’attirer les flux financiers verts mondiaux.

Alors que le CORSIA est un mécanisme fondé sur le marché, établi par l’OACI pour aider l’industrie aéronautique mondiale à atteindre la neutralité carbone d’ici 2050, le carburant d’aviation durable (SAF) est considéré comme une ""clé d’or"" et l’outil le plus efficace pour réduire les émissions de CO₂ à long terme.

Le SAF peut être produit à partir de diverses sources renouvelables, telles que les huiles de cuisson usagées, les déchets agricoles ou encore les algues, et il a le potentiel de réduire de 60% à 80% ou 94% les émissions de gaz à effet de serre sur l’ensemble de son cycle de vie, par rapport au kérosène traditionnel (Jet A1) utilisé pour les avions.

Consciente de cette importance et de cette nécessité, l’aviation vietnamienne a pris des mesures très proactives, notamment en s’inscrivant officiellement et en obtenant la confirmation de l’OACI pour participer à la phase volontaire du CORSIA à compter du 1er janvier 2026.

Il s’agit d’une décision stratégique qui démontre à la fois son rôle de membre responsable et donne au Vietnam le temps de se préparer, de renforcer ses capacités et de bénéficier du soutien technique international avant d’entrer dans la phase de participation obligatoire à partir de 2027.

Vietnam Airlines a effectué son premier vol commercial utilisant du SAF, de Singapour à Hanoi, en mai 2024, et s’est engagée à respecter la réglementation relative à l’utilisation du SAF pour les vols au départ de l’Europe.

Vietjet Air a exploité des vols utilisant du carburant d’aviation durable (SAF) au départ de Hô Chi Minh-Ville à destination de Melbourne (Australie) et de Séoul (République de Corée), affirmant ainsi son engagement fort en faveur du développement durable.

La Société par actions de carburant d’aviation Petrolimex (Petrolimex Aviation) est devenue la première entité au Vietnam à importer et à ravitailler avec succès du carburant d’aviation durable (SAF), posant ainsi une base essentielle à la formation d’une chaîne d’approvisionnement en énergie verte dans le pays.

Au niveau national, l’Institut du pétrole du Vietnam (VPI) mène activement des recherches sur les sources de matières premières disponibles ainsi que sur les technologies de production de SAF adaptées aux conditions vietnamiennes, nourrissant l’espoir d’une autonomie partielle en approvisionnement à l’avenir.

Le plus grand défi : le poids financier

Le respect des réglementations internationales entraînera clairement des coûts d’exploitation considérables pour l’aviation vietnamienne. Concernant les dépenses liées à la participation au dispositif CORSIA, selon des estimations préliminaires, rien que pour l’achat de crédits carbone destinés à compenser les émissions durant la phase volontaire (2024-2026), une grande compagnie aérienne vietnamienne pourrait devoir débourser entre 13 millions et plus de 92 millions de dollars américains, en fonction des fluctuations des prix des crédits sur le marché mondial.

En ce qui concerne le SAF, rien que pour se conformer à la réglementation ReFuelEU de l’Union européenne, qui impose l’utilisation obligatoire de 2% de SAF pour les vols au départ de l’UE, les coûts en carburant des liaisons européennes de Vietnam Airlines pourraient augmenter d’environ 4,8 millions de dollars américains par an.

Ces surcoûts, qu’on le veuille ou non, devront inévitablement être partiellement répercutés sur le prix des billets, affectant ainsi la compétitivité des compagnies aériennes et les choix des passagers.

Dans un contexte où les grands marchés, comme l’Union européenne ont déjà légiféré sur des barrières techniques en matière environnementale, à l’instar de la politique ReFuelEU, la transition verte n’est désormais plus une option.

Si les compagnies aériennes vietnamiennes ne respectent pas les normes imposées, elles ne pourront plus exploiter les lignes vers l’Europe.

Les marchandises exportées du Vietnam perdront alors un canal de transport essentiel, exposant l’ensemble du secteur à un risque d’isolement face aux flux économiques mondiaux.

Il s’agit donc ici d’un choix stratégique fondé sur un sacrifice assumé : renoncer aux profits immédiats pour préserver l’existence, l’indépendance et l’autonomie de l’aviation vietnamienne dans un monde en pleine mutation.

Aucun besoin de modifier les infrastructures aéroportuaires ou les structures des avions et moteurs.

Cependant, le Vietnam est confronté à un déficit en matière de technologie de production de SAF à grande échelle et manque d’expérience dans l’exploitation de cette nouvelle chaîne d’approvisionnement.

Une dépendance totale aux importations, à des prix élevés, engendre de lourds risques en matière de sécurité énergétique et de coût.

Actuellement, le coût de production du SAF est de 2 à 6 fois supérieur à celui du kérosène classique Jet A-1, alors que l’offre mondiale ne couvre qu’environ 0,1% de la demande totale.

C’est là un obstacle majeur auquel l’aviation vietnamienne devra faire face.

Des efforts pour le développement durable

La révolution verte du secteur aérien n’est plus un ""terrain de jeu"" réservé aux nations riches disposant de multiples options.

Elle s’est transformée en une véritable ""arène"" où la survie stratégique est en jeu pour tous les acteurs de l’aviation mondiale.

Les coûts engagés aujourd’hui ne doivent pas être considérés comme de simples pertes, mais bien comme des investissements incontournables pour garantir la ""souveraineté économique"" et l’accès aux marchés internationaux à long terme.

Accepter de renoncer à des gains immédiats est aujourd’hui indispensable non seulement pour rester dans le jeu, mais surtout pour construire une industrie aéronautique vietnamienne solide et durable au bénéfice des générations futures.

L’histoire du Vietnam est jalonnée de sacrifices héroïques : ceux de nos aïeux, qui n’ont épargné ni leur vie ni leur jeunesse pour reconquérir l’indépendance, la liberté et l’unité nationale. Aujourd’hui, confrontés à de nouveaux enjeux, nous sommes engagés dans une lutte sans arme, mais déterminante : celle contre le changement climatique.

Une lutte qui exige un autre type de sacrifice - celui du bénéfice immédiat, le prix à payer pour bâtir un avenir pérenne, un Vietnam vert et prospère pour demain.

Ce défi ne concerne pas seulement le secteur aérien : c’est toute la nation qui se mobilise. Pour transformer cette épreuve en opportunité, l’aviation vietnamienne, sous l’impulsion du Parti et du gouvernement, avec le soutien du peuple et de la société, met en place sans tarder les fondements d’une économie verte.

Les efforts portent sur le déploiement de technologies propres, la recherche et le développement de carburants d’aviation durables (SAF), valorisant les ressources biomasses du pays, mais aussi sur la formation d’une main-d’œuvre verte, une génération de techniciens et d’ingénieurs prêts à maîtriser les innovations de demain.

La transition écologique n’est pas un coût à supporter, mais un investissement pour l’avenir. Animée par l’esprit d’autonomie, de résilience et une ferme volonté de progrès, l’aviation vietnamienne surmontera ce défi.

Elle s’élèvera, non seulement dans le ciel, mais sur la voie du développement durable, contribuant ainsi à affirmer la place du Vietnam comme nation visionnaire, responsable et influente sur la scène internationale.",https://image.lecourrier.vn/MediaUpload/Medium/2025/07/26/172802-ke.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 12:56:38.326621

So, that was pretty much my week, prepping for or making plant health applications. Before we left for last weekend’s travel, I scheduled the final group of corn applications to be Tuesday. Monday, I pre-loaded the mix for the plane.

Since sprayer wheel tracks closed in, I hired a drone to do a couple of the high-yield-potential irrigated fields. Data shows drones to a better job in soybeans anyway, so economically, at the worst, it is probably a push. In an effort to beat the heat, the drone came early Wednesday morning. If neighbors were awake, they saw a strange flying object with red and green flashing lights!

I sprayed with the ground rig other times throughout the week. I’ve got a couple more fields to go next week.

I am concerned that some of the soybeans are getting too tall and are prone to lodging. It’s never good when they start to go down. Sunlight to lower branches is reduced and they don’t yield as well. We’re a long way from filling those pods. Nice, gentle rains for the next month would be appreciated!

Guarding against tar spot

We’re hoping we can get by with only one fungicide application on the corn. Nobody wants to spend any extra money on this crop with depressed commodity prices. However, tar spot can take down yields quickly, and you can’t afford to lose yield, either. Our plant health application should get us three weeks. We will begin checking fields in another week or 10 days to decide whether we need to make a second application.

We caught some rain last Saturday and Sunday, then again early this morning. Amounts varied, but we will call them an inch each time. We’re in a pretty OK moisture position right now, but not more than a week from more crop stress. I’ve seen conflicting weather forecasts for August, so we will wait and see.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt070c2e5dc3677f10/68839cfeaf946d12c87116f7/Stackhouse_072525.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-26 11:56:12.682254

He said he’s spoken with the patrollers about the dangers of the water and rogue waves.","Last week while on a day trip, I listened to this documentary on the CBC program Storylines. It’s about the dangers of rogue waves and includes interviews with a couple of Canadians who were hit by rogue waves while swimming in the ocean during their vacations in Mexico.

Here’s the show’s description of a rogue wave: “A rogue wave is defined as being at least 2.2 times as high as the average waves which have come before. They are described as coming out of nowhere and their consequences can be deadly.”

For the show, Joan Webber, a senior producer with CBC, interviewed Tassie Notar, an artist and documentary filmmaker who previously worked as a television producer with CBC.

In December 2023, Notar and two of her friends, Pam Bertrand and Mary MacNutt, also former journalists, took a trip to Chacala, Mexico. On the first day of the trip, Notar and MacNutt went for a swim at a public beach in a small bay near the resort.

When the pair was swimming, they noticed a wave about four metres tall heading their way. They started swimming for shore, but they get caught in the wave. Notar somersaulted through the wave and landed on her feet. When she found MacNutt, a paramedic from Toronto was already performing CPR, after the wave threw MacNutt up onto the beach.

MacNutt regained consciousness but her prognosis was poor. She was airlifted to Toronto but was having trouble breathing on her own. She asked to be removed from oxygen and other life-sustaining supports.

MacNutt’s obituary is here and it tells the story of a vibrant woman filled with a sense of adventure, fun, compassion, courage, and intelligence. The obituary also mentions the “mammoth rogue wave.”

She adored swimming in the ocean and exclaimed to Tassie: ‘this is glorious’ just moments before disaster struck. Weeks later in the hospital, when Mary knew that her end was near, she admitted: ‘The wave won.’

Notar told Webber in the documentary that she didn’t know about the risk of rogue waves prior to that trip.

“I told many people about what happened to Mary. I haven’t encountered anybody who knows anything about rogue waves,” Notar said.

Just a few days before I listened to that documentary, I was on a boat heading back from Pearl Island, a protected wildlife area where puffins and other birds nest. Pearl Island is a one-hour boat ride from Peggy’s Cove, and I booked the trip with Peggy’s Cove Boat Tours.

During the return from the island, our guide Diana, whose impressive sea legs allowed her to stand on the back of the boat for most of the trip, mentioned the dangers of the waves and told us about people being swept out to sea off the slippery black rocks.

Some of the tourists on the boat had heard warnings to stay off the rocks, so at least some people are getting the message. However, it was still stressful watching the people walk on the rocks from my view on the boat on what was a calm day. Rogue waves can still happen on the calmest of days on the sea.

I took the photo above and thought about how frightening it would be to get swept in the waters and how horrifying it would be to watch it happen.

The people who work in and around Peggy’s Cove, which has a million visitors a year, know about rogue waves, which are mentioned on this tourism website here.

“Rogue waves can occur. Sudden high waves can happen even on calm and sunny days. All visitors must be mindful of the dangers of the waters of Peggy’s Cove,” the website warns.

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has this page about rogue waves, which have long been the stuff of folklore and legend of life on the sea. From the website:

Rogues, called ‘extreme storm waves’ by scientists, are those waves which are greater than twice the size of surrounding waves, are very unpredictable, and often come unexpectedly from directions other than prevailing wind and waves.

Most reports of extreme storm waves say they look like “walls of water.” They are often steep-sided with unusually deep troughs.

Oceanographic Magazine has this article on rogue waves, including details of the largest rogue wave ever recorded. That wave, which was 58 feet tall, was recorded by MarineLabs Data Systems in the North Pacific Ocean off British Columbia in November 2020.

Paul D’Eon also knows about rogue waves and the dangers of the sea. On Tuesday, I met with D’Eon, who is the special projects director with the Lifesaving Society Nova Scotia. He’s spent the last 50 years teaching water safety, first as a lifeguard and then through various roles with the society.

“People are unaware of the power of the waves,” D’Eon said.

We hear the news stories when people are swept out from Peggy’s Cove. Zarin and Harshil Barot were visiting Peggy’s Cove in April 2022 when Harshil slipped into the water. Zarin went in to help, but Harshil drowned. Zarin was rescued and ended up in intensive care.

In April 2015, Jamie Quattrochi and his girlfriend were swept off the rocks by a rogue wave. Quattrochi drowned and his girlfriend made it out of the water.

The Quattrochi and Barot families have both spoken about the importance of preventing more deaths at the site. D’Eon has worked with Quattrochi’s mother, Caroline, on raising awareness about the dangers at Peggy’s Cove.

“We know Peggy’s Cove is where the most people drown in Nova Scotia over the last 40, 50 years,” D’Eon said.

D’Eon said fortunately no one has been swept into the waters off Peggy’s Cove in the last few months. He said that as he knocked on the top of his wooden desk. He said once someone is swept into or falls into the waters, it’s unlikely they’ll get out.

“You’re going to be a statistic. It’s very difficult to escape. You’ve got pounding waves hitting you, slippery rocks that are steep, that you can’t climb up,” D’Eon said. “You can see the shipwrecks off Sable Island. That’ll tell you the story of how powerful the North Atlantic [ocean] is. It’s not to be fooled with.”

D’Eon said that combination of factors at Peggy’s Cove strikes fear even into the best swimmers. He said he’s taken top lifeguards from around the world to Peggy’s Cove. He told me one lifeguard from Australia watched the conditions at Peggy’s Cove and said going in would be certain death.

D’Eon said the beaches of Hawaii and Australia have dangers similar to Peggy’s Cove. He said in Hawaii, there are lifeguards on jet skis who patrol just off the shore of the island’s beaches.

“That climate [at Peggy’s Cove] is not conducive to sitting a guy out there on a jet ski waiting for someone to fall in the water,” D’Eon said.

He said the goal of the Lifesaving Society Nova Scotia is to focus on prevention and stopping people from being swept in or falling into the water in the first place.

These days, there are security guards with whistles who warn people to stay away from the black rocks, or to move back when they are too close to the water. These rock patrollers, as they are called, aren’t lifeguards; they work for a private security company. They have first aid and intervention training.

D’Eon was part of a committee that decided to hire the rock patrollers. He said he’s spoken with the patrollers about the dangers of the water and rogue waves. In the first year on the job (August 2022-2023), rock patrollers issued 3,600 warnings to visitors who were on the black rocks and were too close to the water.

Another form of prevention are the signs warning visitors of the dangers of the ocean and waves. They are all over the area from the time you drive onto Peggy’s Point Road to around the lighthouse perched on the rocks. D’Eon said during a visit to Peggy’s Cove in the spring, he counted 42 signs.

There’s a bronze sign attached to one of the rocks just near the accessible platform. More recent signs are painted in bright yellow with the word “danger” and other warnings on them.

Still, D’Eon said there are other ways to prevent drowning. He said he’s been to many international conferences where ideas for prevention were presented, including a remote-controlled device called Rescue Bob that could be put into the waves. How effective they’d be at Peggy’s Cove is another story.

“I was thinking, this thing is made of plastic, about four feet long. It looks nice in this calm sea, but if a wave picks that up and slams it against a Peggy’s Cove rock, you have a plastic pollution problem,” D’Eon said.

As Yvette d’Entremont wrote in April 2023, Dalhousie University students Willem Glozanski, Zach Gould, Liam Carson, and Tanner Duplessis created a projectile device that launches a life jacket to people in the water until help can arrive.

D’Eon said other suggestions have included a loudspeaker with a message that warns visitors at the site on stormy days or on days when the waves are larger. But how many interventions are too many?

“There’s a mix to wanting it to be a peaceful, pleasant experience. I mean, we could fence it so people can’t get down [to the water], but photographers and artists and the people who want to see the natural environment don’t like that,” D’Eon said.

“A healthy respect for the distance that you stand back, sometimes that won’t even work.”

D’Eon said climate change will play a big role in water safety as storms get worse, winds get stronger, and waves on the ocean get higher. During our interview, he told me about Heather Beach outside of Amherst, the first beach he worked as a young lifeguard. It has lost 90 feet of frontage in the last five decades.

He also mentioned how in the fall of 2023, post-tropical storm Lee flooded the tunnel at Rissers Beach in Petite Rivière.

“In my lifetime, I never would have thought that was possible,” D’Eon said.

And he recalled the story of a lifeguard who was stuck in his car under eight feet of flood waters after a rogue wave washed over Lawrencetown Road. That lifeguard managed to get out of his car and to dry land.

Just as D’Eon was telling me this story, that former lifeguard, Scott Keeling, called D’Eon on his phone.

“[The water] was over my head, so I started swimming up to the teahouse [The Macdonald House] until I could touch ground again,” Keeling said over the speaker on D’Eon’s phone.

I wonder if the increase in drownings is a concern of the Houston government, which ditched the Coastal Protection Act in 2024, downloading the responsibility onto municipalities.

D’Eon said safety should always be top of mind when you’re near or in the water. That’s whether you’re at Peggy’s Cove or at a lake. He encourages people at Peggy’s Cove to tell other visitors they are too close to the slippery rocks and water.

In the meantime, D’Eon works to get the message out and to prevent drownings, including from rogue waves, at Peggy’s Cove and elsewhere. He said the society, lifeguards, and others working to prevent drownings never really know how many lives they save.

“We might think we’ve saved some. It’s the actions they don’t do that saves lives ahead of time. We don’t want to get to the point where we have to make a rescue,” D’Eon said. “Safety first.”

VIEWS

Fact checking Fillmore

You may recall in December, in a scrum with reporters, Mayor Andy Fillmore said this line: “I believe that the worst of the housing crisis in HRM is behind us.” That line was in this story I wrote, published Dec. 3, 2024.

Fillmore said that line in response to a question I asked him about encampments. The scrum took place after council voted against Fillmore’s motion to rescind the list of nine sites for potential tent encampments.

Specifically, my question was about Fillmore’s response to an independent review of the August 2021 evictions from shelters in the city.

In response to my question, Fillmore said this: “A report from Ontario about people living rough in Halifax, I strongly disagree with the findings of that report,” and that the situation in Halifax then in 2024 was “radically different” than in 2021.

Then he went on:

Let’s stay in the present. We have vacancies across the shelter system, and more and more options coming online that are supported and indoors, from the province.

I believe that the worst of the housing crisis in HRM is behind us, and it’s only going to get better. That’s the belief that I have and the work that I am doing to support that belief.

You should know that at scrums with Fillmore, reporters get one question, one follow-up question. To say we were all stunned at that response would be an understatement.

Consider this. In October 2024, Max Chauvin, Halifax Regional Municipality’s director of housing and homelessness, gave a presentation to the accessibility advisory committee. Chauvin said the number of people living outdoors is growing by 4% a month.

Also consider this article by Yvette d’Entremont in May of this year that looked at the “Everyone Counts in HRM Point-in-Time Count Report.” It was conducted in November 2024, so a month before Fillmore made his statement about the housing crisis.

That report is done by the Affordable Housing Association of Nova Scotia (AHANS), whose executive director, Michael Kabalen, said the number of people counted in the report was a minimum of 1,132 people, double the since the last count in 2022.

From d’Entremont’s story:

“First and foremost, 1,132 people is more than the population of Mahone Bay. Imagine Mahone Bay had no housing. That’s what we’re talking about,” AHANS executive director Michael Kabalen said in an interview.

“The 1,132 people that we’re talking about today are real people. These are people who have nowhere that they call home. Let’s think about that for a second.”

I remember thinking after that scrum in December that I would start a segment called Fact Checking Fillmore, in which I would correct or clarify, with help from experts and readers, some of what Fillmore says in scrums, council meetings, and media interviews.

So today, I am starting Fact Checking Fillmore, inspired by this interview Fillmore did on CBC radio’s Maritime Noon with Bob Murphy on Tuesday. The interview focused on strong mayor powers, and included Cape Breton University political scientist Tom Urbaniak as a guest as well. I interviewed Urbaniak in June about strong mayor legislation, which Urbaniak described as “Sort of like a mini-American presidency.”

Murphy asked Fillmore about his thoughts on strong mayor powers, and Fillmore said after nine months on the job he’s learned “the governance system, this older governance system, is creaking under the weight of 21st-century complexities and challenges” and that he can’t deliver his mandate.

Then he said this: “The model we have right now, the model I’ve described as being from simpler, quieter times. In fact, it’s the unelected chief administrative officer (CAO) who holds the power, and is not accountable to the electorate at all….the CAO holds the power and in our organizational chart, I report to the CAO.”

Now, here’s what it says in the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter:

34 (3) The Council shall provide direction on the administration, plans, policies and programs of the Municipality to the Chief Administrative Officer.

Council and Chief Administrative Officer relationship 34 (1) The Chief Administrative Officer is the head of the administrative branch of the government of the Municipality and is responsible to the Council for the proper administration of the affairs of the Municipality in accordance with the by-laws of the Municipality and the policies adopted by the Council.

HRM’s CAO doesn’t hold the power, as Fillmore said. The CAO reports to Halifax regional council, which includes the mayor.

Furthermore, the mayor chairs council’s executive standing committee. That’s the committee that, among other roles, provides liaison and review of the CAO. You can read more here.

This morning, Haley Ryan at CBC did her fact checking, too, and spoke with several councillors about Fillmore’s comments on Maritime Noon.

I sometimes hear that Halifax regional council is “divided” on the issue of strong mayor powers, but I don’t think that’s the case at all, and certainly not what I’ve seen and heard in council chambers.

Here’s what some councillors told Ryan about what Fillmore said on Maritime Noon:

Coun. Patty Cuttell: “I think it’s always unfortunate when people spread misinformation, particularly someone who’s supposed to be a trusted public figure.”

Coun. Janet Steele: “I think it’s really unfortunate that we’re having all this drama over this issue. And I feel like we’ve been hijacked a bit by the mayor and by the premier weighing in.”

Coun. Kathryn Morse: “Either the mayor is not understanding his job, or he’s deliberately misleading people, and either one is terrible.”

Here’s what CAO Cathie O’Toole said: “The mayor is part of regional council. The CAO reports to mayor and council, per the employment contract. The mayor does not report to the CAO. The CAO does not ‘hold the power’ — mayor and council do.”

Ryan’s story is here and also includes the organizational chart Fillmore mentions, which clearly shows the CAO reports to Halifax regional council, which includes the mayor. At the very top of the chart are the residents of Halifax Regional Municipality.

Oh, the Municipal Government Act also has a code of conduct that you can find here. Here’s a line under the section titled General Conduct:

6 (1) A council member must be truthful and forthright and not deceive or knowingly mislead Council, the CAO, staff or the public.

In another scrum earlier this month, Fillmore said he “didn’t fully understand the barriers” to the job of being mayor until he became the mayor.

It’s tough for anyone being in a new job for the first time. There’s lots to learn, but in Fillmore’s case it seems he’s unwilling or uninterested in learning the job as it is, and instead wants to rework the role as he — or Premier Tim Houston — sees fit.

In this post on his Facebook page on July 18, Fillmore is looking to hire four staff members, including a council relations and community liaison role. From the job description:

The Council Relations & Community Liaison serves as a critical connector between the Mayor’s Office, members of Regional Council, and communities across the municipality. This role helps ensure consistent, proactive communication, manages constituent inquiries, and facilitates meaningful engagement between the Mayor and the people of Halifax. It requires a relational mindset, an understanding of municipal governance, and the ability to navigate sensitive or complex dynamics with tact and integrity.

Fillmore certainly needs it.

1. ‘Safe and lovely streets’: Bike lanes and bikelash

Philip Moscovitch has this interview with Patrick Morgan, spokesperson for the Cycling Action Network in New Zealand. Why New Zealand, you wonder? Moscovitch told me that after his Morning File about car brain was posted on Mastodon, many of the comments were from people in New Zealand who ride bikes and advocate for proper and safe biking infrastructure.

Honestly, if you didn’t know this Q&A was about New Zealand, you could easily think it’s about the bikelash in Halifax.

Moscovitch and Morgan talk about the efforts to build biking infrastructure across New Zealand. I won’t share all of the interview except a couple of segments, including this one:

HE: Here in Halifax, we had almost no protected bike infrastructure, and now that the city is building this bike infrastructure, and it’s actually almost at the point of being useful because you have the different segments connecting to each other, we’re seeing bikelash: Rip out the bike lanes, they’re causing too much traffic congestion, they’re too expensive. Why are we wasting money on these things? Everyone’s driving anyway.

Are you seeing a similar pattern?

PM: This pattern is very familiar in New Zealand. Making change can be hard, and cities need to explain really carefully what they’re doing, why, how it will affect people, and what the benefits will be.

Just as your cycling network is getting built, that’s the point of maximum pain. It’s when a lot of the money costs and the construction disruption are really apparent, but maybe you’ve yet to see the full benefits of a connected network. So now is a critical time for politicians to show some backbone, and show their commitment to safe and lovely streets. It’s also critical for bike advocates to keep telling the story about the benefits of offering people more transport choices: happier people, lower health bills, lower fuel bills, less congestion, and more choice.

And then this question and answer:

HE: Is the opposition from governments really about bike lanes, or is it more of a culture-war type of argument?

PM: This is a political playbook that’s well known, which is misdirect. Politicians will always do this. It might be bike lanes now, it could be something else. This kind of politician often wants to blame someone else for the problem instead of looking at the core reasons. If they’re attacking migrants, or people of colour, or transgender communities, or people who ride bikes — they try these different strategies, and see which ones take root. And attacking cycling seems to be effective in some places. That’s why it’s really important to push back against it and make the case for safe and lovely streets. We need to push back and focus on our core values as a community. Safe streets is a really basic value that most people share, and protecting people’s lives in our streets is a strongly held value.

We’re seeing this all play out now in Halifax, of course.

The interview ends with a question from Morgan, who asked this: “Tell me Philip, Is it legal to smoke in bars in Halifax?”

HE: No, it’s not. Strictly speaking, it’s not legal to smoke almost anywhere.

PM: Forty years ago in New Zealand, when we were talking about smoke-free bars, people said the sky would fall, that businesses would close. It would be a terrible thing that can’t happen. Now that we’ve had smoke-free bars for a couple of decades, it’s just not an issue. It’s totally normalized. All the heat has gone out of the discussion. I think bike lanes is like that. We’re going through the point now where they’re being introduced at scale, and people are seeing that it’s happening. But in a decade or so, people will just accept that it is normalized, and they’ll wonder why it was ever different from this.

This is a good summary of how change is hard but also how once the change is made, it benefits everyone and people forget what life was like before the change.

I was working in bars and restaurants when smoking was banned in those establishments across Nova Scotia. A lot of people were concerned about the negative impact on businesses. But that impact didn’t happen.

In fact, for guests and staff, being in no-smoking environments made things much better and safer. I didn’t have to clean ashtrays, my clothes weren’t getting burned by cigarettes, and I wasn’t breathing in second-hand smoke for hours on end. Neither were non-smoking customers.

Twenty years later, it’s so normal to not smoke in bars we can’t imagine it being any other way.

2. Rink fries, chips, and Coke: food marketing in Canadian rec centres

Moscovitch was on a writing roll on Thursday, with this second story after he wrote Morning File.

In this piece, Moscovitch writes about food marketing in recreation centres in Canada. It’s a problem that the food being marketed in rec centres is not terribly healthy. Moscovitch spoke with Sara Kirk, a professor of health promotion at Dalhousie University.

She’s also one of the authors of a paper on food marketing in recreation centres across the country. For the paper, researchers looked at the amount and type of food marketing at 85 recreation and sport facilities (RSF) across Canada. They also looked for correlations between the amount of marketing and whether or not an RSF had food marketing policies, sponsorship agreements, or contracts.

Moscovitch writes:

“We were really interested in the food marketing frequency, and to see whether or not that frequency was in any way associated with whether they had a food sponsorship policy, agreement, or contract,” Kirk said in an interview.

Policy can be internal, or could come from government, or a non-governmental organization. Sponsorships cover everything from Timbits sports, where a fast food giant sponsors teams, to banners in arenas. Contracts are defined in the paper as “legal agreements speciﬁcally between food and beverage suppliers and the RSF to exclusively promote and/or use their products.”

Kirk said the study found that in facilities that had food sponsorship contracts, “Surprise surprise, there was more food sponsorship visible. And that’s kind of like ‘so what. that’s what you would expect.’ But I think the point of this is that unhealthy foods are ubiquitous, and they’re heavily marketed.”

What the researchers found was that food sponsorship was most often connected to junk food. Coke and Pepsi were tops in terms of the number of mentions in RSFs with sponsorship agreements.

Kirk mentions the pressure parents face too because a lot of junk food and fast food is less expensive than making something healthy at home. And rec centres have their own pressures regarding funding, so sponsorships bring in money.

3. The search for sustainable jet fuel: Nova Scotia joins the hunt

On Wednesday, Jennifer Henderson headed to Goldboro on Nova Scotia’s Eastern Shore for a meeting about “the next big thing” in the community that used to be home to gold mines and then a processing plant for natural gas for the Sable Offshore Energy Project.

Henderson writes:

A company called Nova Sustainable Fuels uses maps, charts, and videos to explain what is a complicated engineering process to produce sustainable fuel for jet airplanes, a feedstock that could also be adapted for ships.

There is no project for Goldboro and Nova Scotia yet. Literally a dozen moving pieces — including front-end engineering, environmental assessments, and consultation with the Mi’kmaq and local community — need to align first. But there is a golden marketing opportunity.

Air travel generates tonnes of carbon emissions and is a major contributor to the pace of climate change. The European Union has mandated that 2% of aviation fuel must be low-carbon by 2025, with the percentage of green fuel rising to meet a 70% renewable threshold by 2050.

That’s the brass ring Goldboro and Nova Sustainable Fuels are hoping to grasp. Andrew Parsons (born in Cape Breton and a Nova Scotia university graduate in economics and finance) is the project director. All Parsons will say about the estimated cost to develop 165,000 tonnes a year of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is that the price tag will be “in the multiple billions of dollars.”

Henderson interviewed local residents who spoke with cautious optimism about the project. Nova Scotia’s Eastern Shore has long experienced boom-and-bust cycles.

“Folks in Goldboro have learned all that glitters is not always gold,” Henderson wrote.

She also spoke with Parsons about the project. He said a decision to go ahead on the project will be made by the end of 2027.

Sustainable Travel Technologies: Reducing Environmental Impact Sustainability is at the forefront of travel technology developments in the Middle East.","As the Middle East continues to invest heavily in its travel and tourism sectors, technology has become a key enabler of this transformation. By 2025, the region is poised to become a global leader in travel technology, with innovations that are set to revolutionize how people travel, experience destinations, and interact with transportation networks. The Middle East’s embrace of cutting-edge technology is part of a broader vision to position the region as a major player on the world stage for travel, culture, and economic diversification. Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, the UAE’s Smart Cities initiative, and Qatar’s push toward tourism diversification are driving investments that will ultimately enhance every aspect of the travel experience.

1. AI-Powered Travel Services: Personalizing Every Step of the Journey

Artificial intelligence (AI) has already become an integral part of the travel sector worldwide, and the Middle East is no exception. By 2025, AI-driven solutions will play an even larger role in reshaping the way travelers plan, book, and experience their trips. In the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, several companies are integrating AI-powered tools into travel booking platforms, customer service, and real-time assistance.

One of the most notable developments in AI travel technology is the use of personalized travel recommendations. Companies like Wego (a travel metasearch engine) and Viavii (an experiential travel platform) are leveraging AI and machine learning to offer travelers tailored itineraries based on their preferences, travel history, and current trends. This level of personalization provides a much more refined travel experience, helping travelers to discover new destinations, find hidden gems, and make more informed decisions about their trips.

Airlines are also incorporating AI technology to enhance the passenger experience. For instance, Emirates Airlines has rolled out an AI-based chatbot to assist customers with bookings, check-in, and flight status updates. This is particularly useful during peak travel periods, reducing wait times and improving operational efficiency.

Furthermore, AI-driven systems are now being used for real-time updates on flight status, baggage handling, and even predicting delays or changes to itineraries. As AI becomes more integrated into the region’s travel infrastructure, travelers will benefit from smoother, more personalized journeys, allowing them to focus on enjoying their trips rather than navigating the complexities of travel logistics.

2. Smart Airports: Enhancing Efficiency and Passenger Comfort

The concept of smart airports is quickly gaining traction across the Middle East, and by 2025, most major airports in the region will incorporate digital solutions to create a seamless, efficient experience for passengers. In the UAE, the Dubai International Airport (DXB) has long been a pioneer in the use of technology to streamline the passenger journey. DXB is working to enhance its use of biometric facial recognition technology, AI-powered security systems, and real-time baggage tracking.

One of the key developments expected by 2025 is the widespread implementation of biometric systems that allow travelers to use their facial features or fingerprints to check in, pass through security, and board flights. This eliminates the need for boarding passes and reduces waiting times, making airports more efficient and accessible. Abu Dhabi International Airport is also implementing similar technologies to enhance passenger convenience and speed up the check-in process.

Additionally, airports in Saudi Arabia, including King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, are investing in digital solutions to improve passenger flow. From self-check-in kiosks to automated baggage drop-off points, these innovations are designed to reduce congestion and create a frictionless airport experience for travelers. AI-powered systems are also being used to predict potential bottlenecks at security checkpoints, allowing staff to redirect passengers to less busy areas.

Moreover, smart airports are incorporating digital signage and interactive kiosks to provide passengers with real-time information on flight status, gate changes, and other relevant updates. These systems ensure that travelers are well-informed at every stage of their journey, further enhancing convenience and customer satisfaction.

3. Autonomous Vehicles: Revolutionizing Transportation Networks

One of the most exciting developments in Middle Eastern travel technology is the rise of autonomous vehicles. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar are leading the way in integrating self-driving cars and buses into their transportation networks, aiming to improve efficiency, reduce congestion, and provide passengers with a new level of convenience.

In Dubai, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has partnered with WeRide, a Chinese autonomous vehicle company, to introduce robotaxi services in the city. The autonomous taxis are expected to provide a safer and more convenient mode of transport, particularly during peak hours when traffic congestion is a significant issue. The service, which is set to launch in 2025, will provide a seamless travel experience for visitors and residents alike, with passengers able to book rides using their smartphones.

Similarly, Pony.ai, another autonomous vehicle company, has also expanded its operations to the Middle East, with trials set to begin in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh. These vehicles will offer on-demand transport, allowing passengers to travel to their destinations without the need for human drivers. By 2025, autonomous vehicles are expected to play a central role in reshaping urban mobility in the region.

In addition to autonomous taxis, Saudi Arabia is investing in flying taxis or urban air mobility (UAM) solutions, with the goal of launching air taxis by 2026. These vehicles, powered by electric propulsion systems, will offer passengers a fast and environmentally friendly way to navigate congested urban areas.

4. Blockchain Technology for Secure Travel Transactions

Blockchain technology is making its mark on the Middle East travel industry in 2025. As one of the most secure and transparent technologies available, blockchain offers a solution to many of the challenges faced by travelers, including fraud prevention, secure payments, and identity verification.

Blockchain technology is being utilized to streamline the booking process, with travel platforms leveraging its secure ledger system to ensure that transactions are processed safely and efficiently. Saudi Arabia’s PIF-backed travel initiatives, including those related to digital visas, are utilizing blockchain to provide secure, tamper-proof systems for booking accommodations, flights, and car rentals.

Furthermore, blockchain can enhance travel security by allowing travelers to store their personal information in digital wallets. This eliminates the need for physical passports or paper records and allows travelers to prove their identity securely through blockchain-based certificates.

As blockchain technology becomes more widely adopted, it is expected to significantly reduce the risks of fraud and streamline payment systems, further enhancing the security and efficiency of travel transactions.

5. Sustainable Travel Technologies: Reducing Environmental Impact

Sustainability is at the forefront of travel technology developments in the Middle East. With growing concerns about climate change and environmental degradation, the region is increasingly focused on sustainable tourism solutions that minimize the carbon footprint of the travel industry.

By 2025, electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to become a common mode of transportation for tourists and residents alike. Countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar are implementing EV infrastructure to ensure that tourists can travel sustainably throughout their visits. The development of charging stations for electric cars in cities and key tourist attractions will encourage travelers to opt for greener transportation options.

The Middle East is also focusing on sustainable aviation, with several airlines, including Emirates Airlines, exploring the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to reduce emissions. Additionally, airports in the region are implementing eco-friendly practices, such as energy-efficient terminals, solar power systems, and waste-reduction initiatives, to promote sustainability across the travel sector.

6. Digital Health Passports and Smart Services for Pilgrims

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health passports have become a critical component of travel in the Middle East. These digital health certificates allow travelers to store and share their vaccination records, test results, and other health-related documents in a secure, easily accessible format. Saudi Arabia, in particular, has implemented digital health passports for pilgrims traveling to Makkah and Madinah for Hajj and Umrah.

The use of digital health passports ensures that pilgrims and tourists comply with health and safety protocols, making travel safer and more efficient. In addition, smart services such as virtual reality (VR) tours of religious sites and AI-powered pilgrim assistance systems are improving the overall pilgrimage experience.

7. The Rise of Digital Travel Agencies and Booking Platforms

The traditional travel agency model is evolving in the Middle East, with digital platforms offering travelers personalized, AI-powered services. Companies like Wego and Viavii are providing travelers with customized itineraries, real-time booking options, and seamless payment solutions. These platforms use machine learning algorithms to understand individual preferences and suggest personalized travel experiences based on historical data and user input.

The shift toward digital booking platforms is expected to continue, as more travelers prefer the convenience of managing their trips through mobile apps and online services. These platforms also provide access to comprehensive information about destinations, accommodations, and activities, helping travelers make informed decisions.

8. Tourism Data and Analytics

Tourism data and analytics are becoming increasingly important for both travelers and service providers in the Middle East. Governments and tourism boards are using data analytics to predict tourist trends, identify emerging markets, and optimize travel infrastructure. By leveraging big data, the region is improving its ability to forecast tourism demand, enhance service delivery, and reduce overcrowding at popular tourist destinations.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__55663-1.jpeg,N,,2025-07-26 14:56:47.577219

The $4 trillion question is not whether sustainable finance can work, but whether market participants will implement the reforms necessary to make it work.","By Raghavendra Rau

The global sustainable finance market has reached an inflection point. With the United Nations estimating that $4 trillion annually is required to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing has moved from the periphery to the centre of financial decision-making. Yet fundamental challenges threaten to undermine its credibility and effectiveness.

The evolution from socially responsible investing in the 1990s through Corporate Social Responsibility in the 2000s to today’s ESG framework reflects a growing recognition that non-financial factors materially affect long-term returns. However, this progression has exposed critical structural weaknesses in how we measure and verify sustainability claims.

The most pressing issue facing sustainable finance is the absence of standardised ESG metrics. Different rating agencies routinely assign contradictory scores to the same company, creating confusion for investors and opportunities for manipulation. While quantifiable factors like carbon emissions can be measured with reasonable accuracy, subjective elements such as governance quality remain poorly defined. This inconsistency enables “rating shopping”, where companies selectively engage with agencies likely to provide favourable assessments.

The reliance on self-reported data compounds these problems. Without mandatory third-party verification, companies face few barriers to exaggerating their sustainability credentials. This has given rise to various forms of misrepresentation: greenwashing (inflated environmental claims), brownwashing (concealing harmful practices), and greenhushing (deliberately understating sustainability efforts to avoid litigation). Each undermines market integrity and investor confidence.

As an example of the perverse incentives created by ESG frameworks, consider Malaysia’s used cooking oil (UCO) market. European regulations favour sustainable aviation fuel made from waste products like UCO over virgin palm oil, creating a premium for supposedly “used” oil. The result: fresh cooking oil in Malaysia sells for approximately $0.60 per kilogram while UCO commands $1.00. This price differential has spawned an entire fraudulent ecosystem where fresh oil is passed off as used, defeating the environmental purpose while enriching intermediaries. Criminal syndicates have emerged to exploit this arbitrage, mixing subsidised fresh oil with UCO shipments. The environmental impact is precisely opposite to what regulators intended — instead of reducing waste, the system creates additional demand for palm oil production and associated deforestation.

This cooking oil fraud exemplifies a broader pattern in sustainable finance: well-intentioned regulations creating unintended consequences. When the market values the appearance of sustainability more than actual environmental impact, rational actors will supply that appearance. The UCO case demonstrates how ESG metrics, divorced from rigorous verification, become vehicles for fraud rather than instruments of change.

Current regulatory frameworks remain inadequate to address such systemic failures. The UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment, while well-intentioned, lack enforcement mechanisms. Signatories can claim adherence without meaningful implementation, reducing these principles to symbolic gestures. The European Union’s binding regulations offer a more promising model, yet as the UCO example shows, even mandatory frameworks can be subverted without proper verification systems.

Recent empirical evidence raises additional troubling questions about ESG implementation. Research on board diversity reveals that companies with female directors experience greater IPO underpricing — approximately $13 million more left unclaimed. This suggests that markets may value the appearance of ESG compliance over substantive impact, indicating that much ESG adoption remains performative rather than transformative.

The tension between fiduciary duty and sustainability goals has become increasingly apparent. BlackRock’s legal challenges exemplify this conflict, with the asset manager facing lawsuits from both ESG advocates and critics. This highlights the fundamental question: can investment strategies prioritise sustainability while maintaining competitive returns? The financial sector’s response to this question will shape the future of sustainable investing.

These challenges occur against a backdrop of declining public trust in financial institutions. Survey data indicates that confidence in finance professionals has deteriorated more rapidly than in other sectors since the mid-1990s. This erosion of trust creates additional obstacles for ESG adoption, as sceptical stakeholders question whether financial institutions can credibly champion sustainability.

Proposed technological solutions present their own paradoxes. Blockchain technology could enhance transparency in ESG reporting, but its significant energy consumption contradicts environmental objectives. Such contradictions illustrate the complexity of implementing sustainable finance solutions.

For Malaysian financial markets, these global trends carry important implications. The UCO fraud case demonstrates how local markets can be distorted by international ESG requirements. As international investors increasingly integrate ESG factors into allocation decisions, local companies and financial institutions must navigate between genuine sustainability commitments and performative compliance. The choice of regulatory approach — voluntary guidelines versus mandatory standards with robust verification — will significantly influence market development.

The path forward requires addressing fundamental weaknesses in the ESG ecosystem. Standardised metrics must replace the current patchwork of rating methodologies. Independent verification should become mandatory, not optional. Regulatory frameworks need enforcement mechanisms that ensure accountability. Companies must move beyond symbolic gestures to substantive changes in business practices.

Financial institutions face a credibility test. After decades of prioritising short-term profits, they must demonstrate that their commitment to sustainability extends beyond marketing rhetoric. This requires acknowledging trade-offs between immediate returns and long-term sustainability, rather than perpetuating the fiction that all ESG investments automatically enhance profits.

The sustainable finance sector stands at a critical juncture. The gap between its promise and current practice threatens to undermine legitimate efforts to align financial markets with environmental and social objectives. As the Malaysian UCO case illustrates, without rigorous verification and enforcement, ESG frameworks can create perverse incentives that worsen the very problems they aim to solve. Closing this gap demands rigorous standards, authentic leadership, and regulatory frameworks that distinguish genuine sustainability from performative compliance.

The $4 trillion question is not whether sustainable finance can work, but whether market participants will implement the reforms necessary to make it work. For emerging markets like Malaysia, the decisions made today will determine whether sustainable finance becomes a driver of meaningful change or another chapter in the long history of financial sector disappointments.

Assessing the Strategic Balance Phillips 66's dual focus on conventional and renewable fuels reflects a calculated approach to the energy transition.","In the third quarter of 2025, Phillips 66 finds itself at a pivotal crossroads, navigating the dual demands of a transitional energy landscape. The company's strategic balance between conventional fuels and renewable initiatives reveals a complex interplay of operational resilience, profitability, and long-term vision. For investors, understanding this balance is critical to assessing whether Phillips 66 can sustain its position as a leading integrated downstream energy provider amid shifting global demand.

Conventional Fuels: Cost Discipline and Operational Excellence

Phillips 66's conventional fuels segment continues to anchor its financial stability. In Q3 2025, the company reported a $2.04 per share adjusted earnings from its refining operations, driven by a $8.31 per barrel realized margin and a 94% crude utilization rate. These figures, while slightly lower than Q2 2025, reflect disciplined cost management. The company's $1.4 billion run-rate savings target, achieved ahead of schedule, includes a $1 per barrel reduction in refining costs, underscoring its operational efficiency.

The Refining segment's 87% clean product yield—a 1% increase from the prior quarter—highlights progress in producing cleaner fuels, aligning with regulatory trends while maintaining profitability. Phillips 66's asset disposition strategy further bolsters its conventional fuels focus: $2.7 billion in non-core asset sales, including its Swiss retail joint venture and Midstream assets in North Dakota, have freed capital for high-return projects.

Renewable Fuels: Growth Amid Marginal Pressures

The Renewable Fuels segment, while still unprofitable, shows signs of strategic progress. In Q3 2025, the segment reported a pre-tax loss of $116 million, a narrowing from the $185 million loss in Q1 2025. This improvement stems from higher production volumes—44 million barrels per day (MBD) in Q3 2025, up from 31 MBD in Q2 2024—and realized margin improvements driven by inventory gains and tax credit adjustments.

Key projects like the Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex (RREC) are central to Phillips 66's renewable strategy. The RREC, which produces 800 million gallons annually of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), is supported by a 30.2-megawatt solar facility. This project not only reduces CO₂ emissions by 33,000 metric tons annually but also positions the company to meet growing demand for low-carbon fuels. Strategic partnerships, such as supplying SAF to United Airlines, further validate the scalability of renewable fuels.

However, the segment's profitability remains constrained. Lower realized margins, driven by volatile feedstock prices and regulatory uncertainties, continue to weigh on results. Phillips 66's proposal to convert refineries in New Jersey, Texas, and Louisiana to renewable fuels—pending approval by the U.S. Foreign-Trade Zone (FTZ) Board—could unlock cost advantages via customs duty exemptions, but execution risks persist.

Strategic Synergies: Midstream and Chemicals as Growth Levers

Phillips 66's Midstream and Chemicals segments are critical to its long-term strategy. The acquisition of EPIC's NGL business and the integration of DCP Midstream have generated $400 million in synergies, while projects like the Dos Picos II NGL fractionator aim to boost mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA by $1 billion by 2027. These investments strengthen the company's wellhead-to-market strategy, enhancing resilience by linking renewable production to robust logistics infrastructure.

The Chemicals segment, meanwhile, benefits from Phillips 66's low-cost refining platform, which supplies feedstocks at competitive prices. This vertical integration insulates the company from some of the volatility affecting standalone chemical producers, particularly as demand for petrochemicals remains resilient.

Assessing the Strategic Balance

Phillips 66's dual focus on conventional and renewable fuels reflects a calculated approach to the energy transition. On one hand, the company leverages its refining expertise to maintain profitability in a sector where it retains competitive advantages. On the other, it invests in renewable fuels to align with decarbonization mandates and capture emerging markets.

The key question for investors is whether these initiatives can coexist profitably. The Renewable Fuels segment's $133 million Q2 2025 loss—a $52 million improvement from Q1—suggests progress, but the path to breakeven remains challenging. Meanwhile, the conventional fuels business faces headwinds from refining margin compression and global demand shifts.

Investment Implications

For investors, Phillips 66 offers a compelling case study in balancing short-term profitability with long-term transformation. The company's $5.3 billion shareholder returns in 2024 and $1.1 billion return in Q4 2024 demonstrate its commitment to capital efficiency, while its $17 billion debt reduction target underscores financial discipline.

However, risks remain. The Renewable Fuels segment's reliance on government incentives and its vulnerability to feedstock price swings could delay breakeven. Additionally, refining margins are likely to remain volatile amid global economic uncertainties.

Recommendation: Investors seeking exposure to a diversified energy transition play should consider Phillips 66, but with a long-term horizon. The company's strategic balance between conventional and renewable fuels, coupled with its midstream and chemical synergies, positions it to navigate the transition while maintaining profitability. However, near-term volatility in the Renewable Fuels segment warrants caution.

In conclusion, Phillips 66's Q3 2025 results highlight a company in motion—refining its core while pivoting toward a lower-carbon future. For investors willing to tolerate short-term volatility, the rewards of this strategic balance may prove substantial.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-26 11:56:16.465211

This marks one of the first major endorsements by a consumer goods company in the UK for green hydrogen use.
This infrastructure upgrade aims to connect hydrogen producers with key consumers, such as power plants and industries, facilitating wider adoption of hydrogen energy.
Details of the 10 hydrogen projects kicking off now are below.
Hydrogen UK CEO Clare Jackson said: “Signing these contracts demonstrates the confidence and commitment of both the government and industry in building a sustainable hydrogen sector.","These projects, part of the first phase of the government’s Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR1), aim to decarbonise heavy industry while creating skilled jobs in regions such as South Wales, Bradford, North Scotland and Teesside.

The initiatives form a crucial part of the government’s wider goal to position the UK as a clean energy leader and reduce reliance on fossil fuels in sectors like steel, glass manufacturing and heavy transport. The projects will produce hydrogen domestically through electrolysers, which use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, offering an alternative fuel source to cut industrial emissions.

One project already under construction is the HyMarnham scheme in Newark, Nottinghamshire, where the former High Marnham coal-fired power station is being converted into a green hydrogen hub serving local waste disposal operations.

Another significant development, the Cromarty Hydrogen Project in Northeast Scotland, will deploy 35MW of electrolysers to supply hydrogen to local industries, including distilleries.

Collectively, these projects are anticipated to create over 700 jobs – including apprenticeships and engineering positions – and attract more than £400M in private investment that has been committed between 2024 and 2026. The infusion of capital and expertise is expected to bolster industrial communities and foster innovation.

In a related move, Kimberly-Clark, the maker of household products such as Andrex and Kleenex, has committed £125M to HAR1 projects at its plants in Barrow-in-Furness and Northfleet, partnering with energy firms including HYRO and Carlton Power. This marks one of the first major endorsements by a consumer goods company in the UK for green hydrogen use.

The government’s hydrogen programme is supported by over £2bn in revenue funding over 15 years through the Hydrogen Production Business Model and more than £90M via the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund for capital expenditure. Work continues to finalise agreements with the last HAR1 project developer to ensure all are ready to proceed.

These developments come as the government confirmed £500M in additional funding for a pioneering hydrogen transport and storage network. This infrastructure upgrade aims to connect hydrogen producers with key consumers, such as power plants and industries, facilitating wider adoption of hydrogen energy.

Additionally, the government plans to consult soon on the possibility of blending hydrogen into the national gas transmission system. If viable, this approach could reduce costs for hydrogen production projects and potentially lower energy bills for consumers, as hydrogen is gradually integrated into supply networks for homes and businesses.

The ongoing investment and policy focus underline the UK’s ambition to transition towards a low-carbon economy, with hydrogen expected to play a central role in decarbonising sectors that have traditionally been difficult to clean up using electricity alone.

Details of the 10 hydrogen projects kicking off now are below.

Hydrogen UK CEO Clare Jackson said: “Signing these contracts demonstrates the confidence and commitment of both the government and industry in building a sustainable hydrogen sector.

“Our members are at the forefront of this transition, and their projects will play a vital role in meeting the UK’s net-zero targets while driving economic growth and job creation.”

Hydrogen Energy Association CEO Emma Guthrie said: “This announcement marks a significant and encouraging milestone for the UK’s hydrogen sector.

“The signing of contracts for 10 projects under HAR1 provides vital momentum and confidence for industry and investors alike.

“We look forward to seeing these projects move into the next phase, helping to scale up the UK’s low carbon hydrogen economy.”

Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC) chief executive Neil McDermott said: “LCCC is proud to have signed the UK’s first Low Carbon Hydrogen Agreements, supporting the development of projects under the Hydrogen Production Business Model.

“These agreements provide revenue stability for producers, and a clear signal that low-carbon hydrogen has a key role to play in the UK’s future energy system.

“We look forward to working closely with project developers to bring these projects into operation.”

Kimberly-Clark UK & Ireland managing director Dan Howell said: “We are delighted to be the first UK consumer goods manufacturer to really embrace green hydrogen, showing that manufacturing industries can take the lead and overcome the technical challenge and adopt green hydrogen at scale. This initiative builds on the investments and progress we’ve already made with innovative technologies for our business, our consumers and our customers.”",https://cdn.ca.emap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/geopura-jg-pears-HyMarnham-project-560x315.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 11:56:26.928064

Bondholders will receive a fixed interest payment in exchange for their commitment.

The UK government has launched a consultation to gather evidence on the strategic and economic value of blending hydrogen into the existing gas transmission network for Great Britain. The government’s current “minded to” position is to consider supporting transmission blending of up to 2% hydrogen by volume. Under proposals, the gas grid could serve as a strategic “offtaker of last resort” for hydrogen producers, according to the consultation paper. The consultation will remain open until Sept. 16, 2025, with the government targeting stakeholders involved in the hydrogen economy and natural gas network.

ZeroAvia said it has secured nine new patents this year. It described patents as “critical to the company’s roadmap for scaling hydrogen-electric engines for large regional aircraft.” The company now holds 45 patents related to hydrogen and electric aviation systems, with nearly 250 applications still in process.

Air Liquide said it will build, own, and operate three Air Separation Units (ASUs), two hydrogen production units, and associated infrastructure by 2027 to supply customers with nitrogen, oxygen, argon, hydrogen, helium, and carbon dioxide. The company made the announcement in a press release, linking the project to a long-term contract with a “major customer in the semiconductor industry” based in Dresden, Germany. Air Liquide said it plans to invest more than €250 million.

The Japan Institute of Marine Engineering has awarded the Marine Engineering of the Year 2024 (Dokou Memorial Award) to the passenger vessel Hanaria, which features Yanmar Power Technology Co., Ltd.’s GH240FC maritime hydrogen fuel cell system. “Hanaria is Japan’s first hybrid passenger ship powered by both hydrogen and biodiesel. Operated by MOL Techno-Trade, Ltd., the vessel features Yanmar’s first maritime hydrogen fuel cell system, a proprietary lithium-ion battery system developed by Yanmar, and an integrated management system that controls all onboard power, Yanmar said in an email.

The Dutch Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) said the HyCARB project has received funding to develop fuels and materials from industrial waste gases and CO2 using green hydrogen and green electrons. The project, led by TNO, is supported by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and the National Growth Fund (NGF) programme GroenvermogenNL. “The NGF programme GroenvermogenNL and NWO are funding this project with €35.3 million. Co-funding will provide the consortium with over €10.3 million for a total investment of €45.7 million,” TNO said in a press release.

Zaffra, a joint venture between Sasol and Topsoe, and Moeve (formerly Cepsa), have signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly assess the feasibility of developing electro-sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) facilities in southern Spain, near where Moeve is developing the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley.

This will be Eni’s third biorefinery in Italy, after those in Venice and Gela.

Among the distinctive features of the project, in addition to the use of advanced technologies, there is the possibility of adapting the plant to also produce SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) in the future.

This initiative contributes to the European Union’s decarbonisation goals, with particular reference to the transport sector, and confirms Eni’s energy transition path.

The project is part of Enilive’s strategy to reach more than five million tonnes of biorefinery capacity by 2030.

The European Investment Bank (EIB) and Eni have signed a €500 million 15-year finance contract to support the conversion of Eni’s Livorno refinery in Tuscany into a biorefinery. The agreement was signed today at Eni’s headquarters in San Donato Milanese by EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliotti and Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi.

Eni’s project involves the construction of new plants to produce hydrogenated biofuels at the Livorno refinery site, including a biogenic pre-treatment unit and a 500 000-tonne/year Ecofining™ plant.

Thanks to its proprietary Ecofining™ technology, Eni’s company dedicated to sustainable mobility, Enilive, produces HVO (hydrogenated vegetable oil) – a biofuel made from renewable raw materials[1] such as used cooking oil and agrifood waste. Pure HVO can now be used in approved engines and is distributed through existing infrastructure.

EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliotti said: “The EIB financing is key to delivering a project of high environmental, technological and strategic value, helping to promote the decarbonisation of the transport sector. This is a concrete example of how industrial innovation can accelerate the path towards climate neutrality, while generating sustainable value for regions.”

Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said: “The agreement with the EIB confirms Eni’s concrete and high-quality commitment in the transition towards increasingly decarbonized energy. It also underscores the validity of our approach, which is to invest and leverage all available and effective initiatives and technologies for reducing emissions. This virtuous approach is now leading us to convert a third refinery into a biorefinery in Italy, following the examples of Venice and Gela.”

HVO biofuels play a key role because they can make an immediate contribution to reducing transport sector emissions generated not only on roads, but also by air traffic, maritime and rail transport (calculated along the entire value chain). The conversion of the Livorno site is in line with Enilive’s strategy to increase the production of biofuels in response to growing demand in Europe and Italy, in order to meet both emission reduction targets under RED III (Renewable Energy Directive) and the obligations to release pure biofuels for use as defined by Italian legislation. Worldwide, it is estimated that the demand for hydrogenated biofuels will increase by 65% over the period 2024-2028[2].

The Livorno biorefinery will be able to treat different types of biogenic charges, mainly waste and residues of plant origin, to produce HVO diesel, HVO naphtha and bio-LPG.

Among the distinctive features of the project, in addition to the adoption of advanced technologies, there is the possibility in the future of modifying the layout of the plant to have the flexibility to also produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is a key element of efforts to decarbonise aviation. This gives flexibility to the investment and brings it up to speed with the environmental priorities of the European Union, broadening the potential impact.

This operation is part of the energy transition at national and European level, contributing substantially to decarbonisation of the transport sector and the reduction of CO2 emissions. It also supports the achievement of Italy’s targets for the production of pure biofuels, which under current legislation provides for a gradual increase in use from 300 000 tonnes per year in 2023 to one million tonnes by 2030.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has raised concerns about the European Union’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate targets. IATA is of the opinion that these targets could have big economic and environmental effects.

The organization believes the EU’s ambitious mandate might be too hard to meet particularly due to the limited scope of the current global SAF production capacity.

IATA thinks there has to have a smarter way to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by balancing our green goals with the cost of achieving them.

Given the present challenges, it is too big a problem to switch to sustainable aviation fuels as mandated by the EU, argued IATA.

Objections to EU’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate: Key Takeaways

IATA criticizes the EU’s SAF mandate as overly ambitious.

Limited global SAF production is a significant concern.

Economic and environmental implications are at the forefront.

A balanced approach to SAF policies is necessary.

IATA advocates for a more feasible SAF blending target.

EU’s SAF Mandate and Its Requirements

The European Union has a plan to make flying greener, by drastically reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from flying. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate plays a crucial role in this plan.

Key Components of the European Sustainable Aviation Fuel Directive

The European Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate sets rules for using SAF. It defines SAF, outlines how it should be made, and ensures everyone follows the rules.

This directive helps make using SAF easier by setting clear rules.

Blending Percentage Targets Through 2050

The EU has big plans for using SAF in flying. They want to use more and more SAF over time. Here’s what they plan:

Implementation Timeline for Airlines

As per the plan, airlines need to follow the EU’s SAF madate starting in 2025. They will have to use more and more SAF over time. This gives them time to get ready.

Greener Goals Behind the Mandate

The EU wants to make flying better for the planet. They aim to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions from flying by more and more of SAF in a time-bound manner and make flying cleaner.

Industry Worries Over SAF Mandate

IATA’s objections to the Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate reflects the industry’s worries over its economic and other practical implications.

IATA’s statement and paper explain that the goal of cutting carbon emissions is good, but the rules might be too hard to follow. The position paper says the EU’s SAF goals could hurt airlines’ budgets, making flights more expensive for everyone.

Many big airlines are backing IATA’s fight against the EU’s SAF rules.They fear these rules could raise costs and mess up flights and want rules that fit the industry’s current abilities.

Big airlines like Lufthansa and British Airways support IATA’s challenge. They think the EU’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate goals are too high and can’t be met on time.

The unified stance by these airlines shows their dedication to being green, but they also stress the need for realistic rules.

Economic Burden Analysis of SAF Implementation

It’s important to know how these changes are going to affect the airlines’ financial position. SAF will make flying more expensive for airlines, as it costs more than regular jet fuel and limited supply

The price difference between SAF and jet fuel could be huge. It might even double or triple what airlines pay for fuel.

Further, airlines also need to spend on new infrastructure such as updating storage, transport, and maintenance. This adds to the cost.

Passenger Fare Impact Projections

Higher costs for SAF will likely mean higher ticket prices. Fares could go up a lot. This might make people want to fly less.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said, “We want to cut carbon, but we must do it without hurting airlines or passengers.”

“Moving to SAF is a big step for green flying. But we need to plan carefully to avoid hurting our wallets.”

Environmental Efficacy Concerns Raised by IATA

IATA has raised important environmental concerns about the EU’s SAF rules because of the limitations on SAF production capacity. They think the measures to fix the supply gaps could harm the environment.

Global SAF Production Capacity Limitations

IATA argues that the world can’t make more SAF to meet the EU’s big targets as we don’t have enough places to make SAF.

Key limitations include:

Limited production facilities

Insufficient feedstock supply

Technological constraints

Sustainability Certification and Carbon Accounting Issues

IATA is worried about how SAF is made and counted in carbon emissions. It’s important to make sure SAF is made in a green way. This helps the EU’s SAF rules work better for the planet.

Feedstock Sustainability Questions

IATA is concerned about where SAF’s ingredients come from. They want to make sure these ingredients don’t harm the environment. This includes not causing deforestation or land damage.

Life-Cycle Emissions Analysis

It’s key to know how much carbon SAF really saves. IATA wants clear methods to measure this. This way, we can really see how much SAF helps the environment.

Supply-Demand Mismatch in the SAF Market

A big problem in the aviation world is the gap between SAF supply and demand. The EU wants to use more SAF to cut down on carbon emissions. But, there’s not enough SAF being made to meet this goal.

Current Global Production Capabilities

Right now, we can’t make enough SAF to meet the needs of flying. Most places making SAF are just starting or making a little bit. Most of the SAF made is in a few areas, and it’s not enough for the planes.

EU Demand Projections vs. Available Supply

The EU has big plans for using more SAF in planes. But, there’s not enough SAF to go around. This means there’s a big gap between what’s needed and what’s available. We need to make a lot more SAF to meet the EU’s goals.

Regional Production Disparities

Some places, like the EU and North America, are working hard to make more SAF. But, other areas are not keeping up. This will be big challenge to get enough SAF for everyone.

SAF making technology is getting better. New ways to make SAF and improve existing ones are being developed. However, we need to make SAF faster enough to meet the EU’s targets.

European Commission’s Response to Industry Concerns

The European Commission has listened to IATA’s worries about the SAF mandate. They are thinking about changing the policy. This could include adjusting blending targets and timelines.

Possible Compromise Solutions and Timeline Revisions

There are a few ways to solve the problem. One idea is to let airlines use different ways to meet SAF goals. This could include buying SAF credits or investing in SAF projects.

International Coordination Efforts

Another idea is to work together globally to make more SAF. This could mean working with governments, airlines, and SAF makers to build new facilities and supply chains.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate: Conclusion

The aviation industry is at a crossroads. It must cut down on carbon emissions while staying in business. The European Union wants to make flying greener with new rules on renewable jet fuel.

But, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) worries about the EU’s big plans. They think it might be too hard to meet the targets.

Finding a middle ground is key. We need to look at the cost of green fuel, its real impact, and if there’s enough of it. The EU needs to listen to the industry and find a way to make flying greener without hurting the industry too much.

Changing the timeline and setting more achievable goals could help. This way, the industry can start using cleaner technologies. It will help reduce the carbon footprint of flying.

Currently, over £136 million has been awarded through CMDC to more than 140 organisations across every UK region, with total UK SHORE funding supporting over 300 organisations, including 250 SMEs.

Diane Gilpin, Smart Green Shipping (SGS), CEO said:

“CMDC3 support enabled SGS, a Scottish based business, to demonstrate the safety and robustness of FastRig, our Clyde built wingsails, and to build out our digital decision-making platform, FastReach, which underpins our unique wind-as-a-service proposition.

“Over the last 3 years SGS has invested £7.6 million in R&D, 60% of that in Scotland. We’ve drawn upon engineering design skills in adjacent sectors like renewables and oil and gas, and digital expertise created in Scotland’s vibrant tech community.”

Green infrastructure and skills for the future

Glasgow’s King George V Docks, operated by Peel Ports Clydeport, is receiving £3 million to upgrade infrastructure to handle larger wind turbine components. This investment supports Scotland’s growing role in renewable energy supply chains and highlights how ports are transforming into green energy hubs.

In other areas, successful CMDC projects include electric charging networks at ports, green hydrogen shore power systems in Leith, and the demonstration of an electric crew transfer vessel for offshore wind farms in Aberdeen.

Advanced manufacturing is also being supported through the National Manufacturing Institute Scotland, which has worked on CMDC-funded projects to improve shipbuilding efficiency and reduce emissions. These efforts aim to reduce lead times, localise production, and integrate sustainability into the core of maritime engineering.

The CO2 Battery is capable of continuously dispatching energy for periods of 8 to 24 hours, unlocking enough firm electricity to meet both the baseload and flexibility requirements of large energy users. The modular, site-independent product design uses off-the-shelf equipment without supply chain bottlenecks, ensuring a highly scalable solution to store massive amounts of energy efficiently and cost-effectively.

Furthermore, the mechanical components of the technology help stabilize the grid by providing natural inertia from rotating machinery. This is especially important given the concurrent ramp-up of solar and wind (which lack inertia) with the ramp-down of legacy fossil-fuel power stations, whose inertia is lost when the plants are decommissioned. The CO2 Battery thus contributes to maintaining grid resiliency by acting as a shock absorber to smooth out sudden changes in frequency.

“Google is committed to powering our operations with clean energy, and Energy Dome’s technologically proven and scalable long-duration energy storage solution can help us unlock rapid progress,” said Maud Texier, Director of EMEA Energy at Google. “But this isn’t just about Google. By helping to scale this first-of-a-kind LDES technology, we hope to help communities everywhere gain greater access to reliable, affordable electricity and support grid resilience as we integrate more renewable energy sources.”

The commercial agreement aims to develop CO2 Battery projects in all the key geographical strategic areas, including Europe, America, and the Asia-Pacific region, with the goal of scaling up deployment at a rapid pace to meet Google’s 2030 carbon-free energy goals.

Conclusion China Aviation Oil is neither a guaranteed winner nor a value trap.","In the shadow of China's post-pandemic economic rebound, one company stands at the crossroads of opportunity and uncertainty: China Aviation Oil (Singapore) Corporation Ltd (SGX:G92). As the exclusive importer of bonded jet fuel into China's busiest airports and a global player in aviation fuel trading, the firm's fortunes are inextricably tied to the health of the aviation sector. But with a stock price that has underperformed despite robust fundamentals, the question lingers: Is SGX:G92 a mispriced gem or a cautionary tale?

Financial Undervaluation: A Case of Metrics vs. Sentiment

China Aviation Oil's valuation metrics scream for attention. As of July 2025, the stock trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 9.59, significantly below its 13-year median of 10.64 and the Asian Oil and Gas industry average of 11.6x. Its P/B ratio of 0.75 suggests the market values the company at 75% of its book value—a rare discount for a firm with tangible assets and a debt-free balance sheet. The company holds SGD 682.82 million in cash and equivalents, a financial cushion that amplifies its appeal in a volatile sector.

Yet, the stock's current P/E of 9.59 exceeds its estimated fair P/E of 8.7x, a discrepancy that hints at skepticism about future growth. This tension between historical value and forward-looking caution creates a compelling case for investors willing to look beyond short-term volatility.

Strategic Market Position: Monopoly Power in a Fragmented Industry

China Aviation Oil's dominance in the Chinese aviation fuel market is its most formidable asset. As the exclusive importer of bonded jet fuel to airports like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, the company controls a critical chokepoint in the supply chain. Its 33% stake in Shanghai Pudong International Airport Aviation Fuel Supply and 26% stake in Oilhub Korea Yeosu further cement its infrastructure footprint.

The company's pivot to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) trading adds a layer of future-proofing. With global mandates for low-carbon fuels gaining momentum, CAO's early engagement in SAF positions it to capture margins from a niche market expected to grow at a 20%+ CAGR over the next decade.

Ownership structure also bolsters its strategic credibility. Backed by China National Aviation Fuel Group (CNAF) and BP Investments Asia, the company enjoys institutional support that mitigates operational and political risks. This alignment with global energy giants is a subtle but powerful endorsement.

Long-Term Growth Potential: Riding the Tailwinds of Recovery

The post-pandemic aviation recovery in China is not just a headline—it's a structural shift. While 2024 saw an oversupply of jet fuel (supply outpacing demand by 40%, per Kpler), the long-term fundamentals remain intact. IATA projects a 5.7% CAGR in China's passenger traffic over the next two decades, driven by urbanization, visa liberalization, and the rise of the middle class.

China Aviation Oil's FY2024 results underscore this potential: revenue rose 7.5% to USD 15.5 billion, with net income up 33% to USD 78.4 million. The company's net profit margin improved from 0.4% to 0.5%, a modest but meaningful step toward operational efficiency.

However, the path to growth is not without hurdles. The rise of fuel-efficient aircraft and the rise of high-speed rail alternatives could dampen demand. Additionally, the transition to SAF, while promising, requires significant infrastructure investment and regulatory clarity.

Risks and Realities: A Cautionary Note

The company's recent 8.5% stock price drop following FY2024 results highlights market skepticism. Analysts cite overcapacity in the aviation fuel sector and uncertain margins from SAF as key risks. While CAO's debt-free status is a strength, its reliance on a single market (China) exposes it to geopolitical and regulatory shifts.

Investment Thesis: A Calculated Bet

For long-term investors, China Aviation Oil presents a high-conviction, low-risk opportunity. Its undervalued metrics, strategic moats, and alignment with global decarbonization trends justify a cautious bullish stance. The stock's current discount to intrinsic value—supported by a P/B of 0.75 and strong cash reserves—offers a margin of safety.

Key catalysts to watch:

- SAF adoption rates and regulatory support in China and Asia.

- Expansion of domestic air travel as middle-class disposable income grows.

- Infrastructure investments in storage and logistics, which could unlock new revenue streams.

Investors should consider:

- Diversification to mitigate sector-specific risks.

- Monitoring CAO's capital allocation in SAF and infrastructure.

- Valuation re-rating if the market begins to price in long-term decarbonization trends.

Conclusion

China Aviation Oil is neither a guaranteed winner nor a value trap. It is a company at a crossroads, with a strong foundation and a clear path to growth—if it can navigate the turbulence of overcapacity and shifting demand. For investors with a five- to ten-year horizon, SGX:G92 offers a compelling case of undervaluation and strategic positioning. In a world where energy transitions and geopolitical shifts redefine industries, CAO's jet fuel monopoly and green ambitions could prove to be its greatest assets.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-25 22:56:33.510949

Despite this, European ESG fund flows have stabilised for now.
“European Investors have returned to ESG funds, marking a notable reversal from the redemptions seen in the previous quarter.
This is partly attributed to asset managers responding to new fund naming guidelines introduced by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
In the first quarter alone, more than 180 European funds removed words like “ESG,” “sustainable,” or “sustainability” from their names.","The shift was led by European investors, who added $8.6bn after pulling $7.3bn the previous quarter.

US investors continued to exit the space, withdrawing $5.7bn, marking the 11th consecutive quarter of outflows. The rest of the world brought in $2bn in net inflows.

The rebound comes amid ongoing policy uncertainty. In the US, President Donald Trump’s return to the White House earlier this year brought new executive actions targeting ESG-related policies, particularly those tied to diversity, equity and inclusion.

Additionally, in February, the US signed an executive order imposing tariffs on imports from nearly 60 countries. The Trump administration has further set about gutting billions of dollars of renewable energy and cleantech subsidies first included in the Inflation Reduction Act, passed under Joe Biden’s administration.

According to S&P Global Ratings, shifting trade and environmental policies are complicating decarbonisation efforts, with rising credit risks in sectors like power, utilities and industrials that rely on stable regulation and high capital investment.

These actions have raised legal and financial risks for US firms and pushed global asset managers to adopt a more muted tone on ESG issues.

That shift in tone is also being felt in Europe. Lawmakers are keen to cut red tape for investors and businesses to buoy growth post-pandemic.

The European Commission’s “Omnibus” package, which proposes adjustments to sustainability reporting rules, has added complexity for asset managers and companies. Despite this, European ESG fund flows have stabilised for now.

Morningstar Sustainalytics’ head of sustainable investing research Hortense Bioy said: “Despite the ESG backlash and the volatility sparked by geopolitical tensions and US tariffs, the picture for ESG funds improved last quarter.

“European Investors have returned to ESG funds, marking a notable reversal from the redemptions seen in the previous quarter. While it’s still doom and gloom in the US, ESG funds in other parts of the world continue to attract money and regulators outside the US are largely maintaining their course.”

‘ESG’ and ‘sustainable’ top removed terms in European funds rebranding

The research also highlights that in Europe, renaming activity reached a record high in the second quarter, with close to 600 funds changing their names in the last three months.

This is partly attributed to asset managers responding to new fund naming guidelines introduced by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).

Over the past 18 months, 1,346 funds have been renamed, covering about $1trn in assets. Of these, 785 dropped ESG-related terms, 458 changed them, and 103 added them.

This activity builds on a trend seen earlier this year. In the first quarter alone, more than 180 European funds removed words like “ESG,” “sustainable,” or “sustainability” from their names. In place of these labels, asset managers are increasingly using alternatives such as “screened,” “transition,” “climate,” and “committed.”

In the UK, 110 funds have now adopted an official sustainability label under the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)’s new Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR) rules, representing $62bn in assets. These account for about 20% of UK-domiciled funds that claim sustainability characteristics.

Green bonds market

Outside of funds, ESG-labelled debt markets have slowed.

New data from Sustainable Fitch has revealed that total labelled bond issuance, including green, social and sustainability-linked bonds, fell 25% year-on-year to $440bn in the first half of 2025.

Green bond issuance alone dropped by $100bn, or 32%. The share of ESG-labelled bonds in overall global issuance declined to 10.2%, from 11.7% in 2024.

Research points to uncertainty around ESG regulations in both the US and Europe as a key reason for the decline. Capital spending plans have also been affected by wider macroeconomic and geopolitical instability, contributing to the hesitation among issuers.

Despite these challenges, the rise in ESG fund flows in Europe and increased product launches in markets like Southeast Asia suggest that investor interest in sustainable strategies has not disappeared.

The second half of 2025 will be shaped by how quickly regulators provide clarity and how asset managers respond to the shifting landscape.",https://edienetlive.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/GlobalFinanceStock.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 08:57:18.672619

Boom Supersonic Founder and CEO, Blake Scholl. (All: Boom Supersonic)

AEROSPACE: What was your reaction on completing the XB-1 flight test campaign? Relief, satisfaction, elation at proving the sceptics wrong?

SCHOLL: Probably all of those. I think I was most buoyed by how much positive reaction there was outside of the company. It got noticed a lot more and there was a lot more excitement than I anticipated. One of my favourite things were the pictures and videos that came out of classrooms with kids glued to the screen watching it. There’s one I saw where a little girl was jumping up and down the moment it went supersonic and it just spoke to me very deeply. Somewhere, in one of those classrooms, there’s a chief engineer for Overture Three, for the hypersonic Overture and I just haven’t met them yet. Of course, the first mission is to bring back supersonic flight and to make it available for everybody. But the second mission is to be inspiring. If we can do that, it’s going to help rejuvenate aviation, inspire more great young people to go into the sector. That will pay dividends decades out. Somewhere around the ‘70s, we quit doing new, exciting things, and the result was a whole generation of young people who never went into aerospace.

AEROSPACE: It was great to see this transparency with live streaming the flight test – especially for a piloted supersonic demonstrator that did not have an ejection seat. Did you have any qualms about that?

SCHOLL: We didn’t stream the first flight for basically that reason. Nor did we have any guests or media; we didn’t tell anybody what was going to happen. The safety culture is very important to me and to Boom, and one of the crucial things is preserving the team’s ability to make their own go/no-go decisions and avoiding pressure like that, regardless of whether anybody was watching. In fact, that happened on the first flight. It was originally going to be about a week earlier than it actually was. We were under pressure to fly, but I would get in front of the team every morning and say we know it’s about time to go, but if you find a problem with the aeroplane, we most definitely want to know. We might say a four letter word, but then we’re going to say ‘thank you’, and then we’re going to say, ‘what do you need to fix it’? It turned out that was exactly what happened. The day before the planned first flight, one of our young, early career engineers said, ‘Hey, I was going through data on the drag chute’, which is really just back-up equipment and we didn’t expect to ever need it. She said, ‘I think we need to fix it.’ I said a four letter word and then said, ‘thank you for telling me. How do we get behind you and support you in fixing this?’ Her name is Grace, and we celebrate her.

AEROSPACE: What was the biggest lesson you learnt from XB-1?

SCHOLL: There’s a lot you can learn about supersonic aeroplanes by reading papers and books, but there’s a lot you can learn only by doing it. We learned what it takes to really execute a supersonic programme from scratch, to build an aircraft and to put a human on board. We learned where the real challenges are, the real break points in the technology and the cultural challenges. We learned how to build a safety culture. I’m very proud of that. For Overture, we originally started out targeting Mach 2.2 or 10% faster than Concorde. On paper, that seemed very feasible but, as we went to do it, we found out the hard thing that you won’t read about in books is that a long, skinny aeroplane, with a delta wing that is even more slender than Concorde leads to significant low speed challenges. Landing gear packaging gets much harder with a Mach 2.2 aircraft than a Mach 1.7 one because it is hard to fit it in this fuselage. We backed off the 2.2 goal to 1.7 which really means a 15 or 20 minute longer flight across the Atlantic. I hate that, but it results in a much more buildable aeroplane, low-speed handling gets easier and complying with the latest-generation take-off and landing noise standards gets much easier. Thermal management gets much easier. We are eventually going to build an aircraft that will fly faster than Concorde, mark my words – but we found a pragmatic place to start, thanks to everything we learned from XB-1. The whole point of XB-1 was to learn and Overture got much better as a result of it.

AEROSPACE: Boomless cruise was big news from the flight test. Was that something that was expected or just a happy discovery?

SCHOLL: We weren’t banking on it. We didn’t invent that – people have known about Mach cutoff for decades but if you can make it happen at a shallow enough angle and a high enough altitude, it makes a U-turn in the atmosphere, refracts upwards and never touches the ground. However, to do this, you need to have good enough weather data to calculate what the speed needs to be on any given day. You also need enough power to break the sound barrier at a sufficiently high altitude so that the bottom of that ‘U’ doesn’t touch the ground. Plus you need engines that are efficient enough to maintain transonic speeds without losing too much range.

Originally, we were working with Rolls-Royce but the transonic performance was not there and the highest altitude versus sound barrier was 20,000ft. Initially we decided to focus on overwater supersonic flight and come back to the overland thing later but then, along the way, we switched to our own engine and there are many benefits to that. Firstly, we get a fully optimised, custom-built aircraft and engine combination. I would meet with the engineering team regularly to discuss how the optimisation was going and in every meeting it seemed that this transonic performance was just getting better. XB-1 breaks the sound barrier because of the engine and aircraft combination; it just happens that it was easy to do it and achieve boomless cruise.

Then I thought ‘wait a minute, maybe we should rerun the maths?’ So I called an emergency engineering meeting. Everybody came in on a Saturday and I said, ‘can you rerun the maths into the Symphony engine without changing anything. Can we do boomless cruise?’ We ran the maths in the meeting and it worked – we didn’t have to do anything, it just worked. So actually, we sort of just lucked into it. This is one of many things about Overture that we never could have had if we hadn’t made our own engine.

AEROSPACE: What engine did Rolls-Royce offer?

Boom's Symphony engine is now being built.

SCHOLL: It was going to be a scaled-up version of the three-spool core advanced Trent. However, it came with downsides because the Trent cores are optimised for a subsonic flight profile where you only need full power for take-off and then you throttle back to cruise. So, for example, the cooling architecture in the core, the hollow turbine blades, doesn’t provide much cooling flow because they’re only hot for a little while. Meanwhile, our engine will stay hot for the entire flight and take-off is actually when they’re coolest.

Now that we’re designing the engine in-house, we were able to run studies much, much faster. We looked at about a dozen different engine designs with the same basic architecture, but we’re tuning core size and fan size. We were able to generate what’s called an engine deck to test those variables and the team can just press a button and have a whole aircraft/engine combination ready for the mission simulator. We can then evaluate the aircraft through a complete mission profile to take off, climb out, accelerate, cruise, descend and land, assessing how efficient and quiet it was from a take-off and landing noise perspective.

By evaluating a lot of different engine designs quickly (which we never could have done with a third-party engine provider), we were able to find a much better design and enable boomless cruise.

It also enables a breakthrough in the passenger cabin that we haven’t shared yet. There was a breakthrough the team had about 18 months ago for a passenger cabin concept, that no one’s ever going to believe you could do. When we first looked at it, it cost 1,000 miles of range – but we got the 1,000 miles back through this engine optimisation and the passengers will get something great.

AEROSPACE: What are your recruitment priorities as you scale up and move to engine testing?

SCHOLL: We are about to grow, albeit modestly. I am a big believer in keeping the team small. For XB-1 a legacy company would have needed 500 engineers, maybe 5,000. We did it with 50 people, including engineers, technicians and pilots. I think when Overture flies, one of the most astonishing things will be how small the team was. We have a concept at Boom we call the talent distillery. It’s hard to find enough people from legacy companies who are both really good and are going to fit at a start-up culture that’s about moving fast and being innovative. What we do is build the core of the company out of young people. We find the best and the brightest – sometimes it’s interns, sometimes people graduating. Sometimes we go and rescue somebody out of Boeing at the start of their career! Those are the young spirits. Then we get just a few people with some experience that are still open-minded, and we make those people the mentors, the advisers. I think this formula really works and it means we’re building our next generation of leaders.

AEROSPACE: Are you utilising AI tools in the development of Overture?

SCHOLL: We have some custom AI tools that we can drop all the certification documentation, regulations and advisory circulars into and it writes a certification document. As an example, it takes a couple of minutes to generate a 100-page lightning strike test plan. Then it takes an engineer about three hours to review it and edit it. Previously, that would take about a month.

AEROSPACE: Why will Boomless Cruise work for Boom, if it did not work for Concorde and overland flight before?

SCHOLL: If you talk to retired Concorde pilots they’ll say they did [boomless cruise] sometimes, but it was by accident. They couldn’t do it reliably or efficiently as they didn’t have the weather data. Also the aircraft didn’t have the performance to do it efficiently – Concorde would have been in afterburner to achieve it, and that would cut the range in half.

AEROSPACE: What about noise regulations around airports? Surely that will be an issue too?

Supersonic take-off and landing noise restrictions have now been ratified by ICAO.

SCHOLL: It’s fundamental but we are going to meet the same, most stringent noise levels that apply to latest-generation aircraft. ICAO just ratified this earlier this year – with Chapter 14 noise levels that will apply to subsonic aircraft, and there’s now a Chapter 15, which sets supersonic take-off and landing noise standards globally. Applied to supersonic airliners it allows them to fly with advanced procedures to minimise noise and it turns out actually you can make the aircraft quieter. We’ve got something called the variable noise reduction system (VNRS) which is really just automated procedures on take-off and landing that configure the aeroplane to minimise the noise footprint on the ground. This means we can meet the same noise footprint. The FAA has been supportive, but we’re grateful that we have got support in Europe as well. We’re doing everything we can to create an aircraft that is easy for ATC, easy for airports, easy for airlines and easy for the community.

AEROSPACE: Is there a minimum launch number for Overture?

SCHOLL: We already cleared that number a long time ago. We had 130 aeroplanes on order and pre-order – that is the first five years of production. After that, every major international airline is just going to say ‘we need a supersonic airliner or else I can’t compete.’ We are putting zero energy into sales at the moment; if airlines call us, we tell them we’ll call them back later. We’re just focused on building the aircraft for now.

AEROSPACE: What do you say to those who question the business case for supersonic air travel? We have high-speed wi-fi now and lie-flat beds that didn’t exist in Concorde’s day.

Boom is promising a 'never before' seen feature for its passenger cabin.

SCHOLL: We haven’t unveiled it yet, but we have something very wonderful for the cabin and very different from Concorde. You had to duck to get onto Concorde but our cabin will be two inches taller than a narrowbody – so a 95th percentile male can step on board without bumping his head. It has not got a flatbed because it’s a three or four hour flight and you sleep much better at home than you sleep on any flying flatbed. The thing to remember here is if you are just shaving 15-20 minutes off flights it doesn’t matter – but what we’re doing is we’re turning ‘red eyes’ into daytime flights. From the US to Europe, instead of flying overnight and trying to sleep on the aeroplane, you catch a morning flight from the US, and even with the time difference, you can get to Europe in time to make a late afternoon meeting or dinner. It saves you a whole night, and you’re much better rested because you slept at home.

Concorde was great technology but the wrong aircraft. It was a 100 seat aeroplane with, adjusted for inflation, £20,000 return tickets. It is very hard to find a route where you can fill 100 seats at £20,000, so it’s not economically compatible with very many routes.

Since then, the market has got a lot bigger. The travel demand today is many times greater than it was in Concorde’s heyday and that just makes everything easier. The other thing is we shrank the number of seats, so it’s much easier to get a good load factor. People often say Concorde was too small but actually the reverse is true. We’ve been very thoughtful about making sure Overture is the right aircraft. It has 64 seats, the economics work out that this can support business class fares, more like $5,000, making it economically compatible with more routes.

AEROSPACE: What about military variants? You’ve proposed Overture as a supersonic Air Force One.

Could we see a supersonic Air Force One?

SCHOLL: We really zeroed in on what we want to do there and we did some great work with DoD and some great work with Northrop to understand where the aircraft is useful and where it’s not. It’s not a good ISR aircraft and it would make a terrible tanker but it’s really good at moving people and things. The most obvious use case is as an ultra VIP transport. In the US today we have some rusty old 757s that carry around the First Lady, Cabinet members and congressional delegations. Sometimes they even carry around the president – but they go Mach .75, and they’re really old so they are expensive to maintain. Today’s Air Force One (AF1) is a 747 and Overture is obviously much smaller – but for the price of one converted 747 the US government could get ten Overtures. That large aeroplane has to be basically a flying tank, it needs missile defences, countermeasures and who knows what else. However, the reason all of this is needed is because anybody watching knows exactly where the president is – but when the president travels on the ground, he doesn’t travel in a tank; he travels in a motorcade. So why don’t we do the same thing in the air? What if there were five Overtures and the bad guys don’t know which one POTUS is in? If you think of it that way, it could be far safer and more pragmatic to build several AF1s.

AEROSPACE: What about the environmental impact of supersonic flight?

SCHOLL: We’re forward compatible with sustainable aviation fuel, so when there is enough available we’ll be able to run on 100% SAF. However, I think the way the world thinks about CO2 is often wrong. There is only one atmosphere, and it’s all mixed together – yet we go after every source individually. For example, right now aviation contributes around 2.5% of global CO2 and supersonic aviation will start off being a tiny portion of that. On the other hand, the impact from forest fires is about ten times bigger than aviation, we should figure out how to fix those – we’re not thinking holistically about the problem.

AEROSPACE: How serious do you think China is about supersonic airliners?

SCHOLL: They’re really serious. The way to tell is they gave it a product number, C949. The release that was put out is obviously a cartoon and anybody who knows anything about supersonic aircraft knows that one won’t work. But I don’t think it is the actual aircraft. They haven’t figured it out yet. We’re ahead, and if we can stay out of our own way and go fast, we’ll win the race.

AEROSPACE: You revealed the Overture flightdeck last year at the Farnborough – was there any changes or feedback from Concorde pilots and other pilots who trialled it?

SCHOLL: People already love it but, but we can make it so much better. One of my beliefs is that to get the best product, whether we're talking an engine, flight deck or passenger cabin, requires constant iteration. I found all kinds of things people didn't love, like the throttle handles which are too big for those with small hands. Meanwhile the Airbus pilots are: ‘where's the where's the tray table for my food’? There are many other little details that are not quite dialled in yet, so the final design will lock as late as possible.

I know pilots would love to hand fly this thing, but in the boomless cruise mode in particular you really need the real time weather data feeding the autopilot – so it will be an autopilot selection. It will then pick the fastest quiet speed for the cruising altitude and if there is a better altitude or heading give recommendations to the pilot.

AEROSPACE: What are Boom’s next milestones?

SCHOLL: We are in the process of modifying the engine test facility out in Colorado for Symphony testing and in the first part of the manufacturing process for the prototype core. The first turbine blades came out of the 3D printer in March. Every day I’m approving a purchase order for engine parts and the assembly will start in September or October. The goal is to make ground runs by the end of the year, it’ll be tight, but it’s getting done. Then next year, we’ll do a full-up turbofan. In parallel, we’ve reached firm configuration on Overture, and we’re in the process of refining that now, doing the systems and detailed engineering. Later this year we’ll release the final outer mould line and then that will support the development of the next part. It won’t be long before one of these things will be rolling out.

AEROSPACE: What is going to happen to XB-1 now?

XB-1 'Baby Boom' was a success, but its mission is now complete.

SCHOLL: It is going come back to Denver to sit in our new R&D building. The most awesome thing we’ve built will be in our lobby, and it will inspire the men and women who are working really hard to create everything else. I want them to walk in every day, see it, and remember what this company can do if we work hard and smart, Once we have something better than XB-1, then we'll let XB-1 go to a museum. I think inspiration really matters. I don't want to walk into an office building, I want to walk in and see what we've done and be inspired by that.",https://www.aerosociety.com/media/27021/boom-blog-6.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 01:56:18.945517

The massive budget bill contains a slew of provisions normally included in a farm bill.

Funding for SNAP is typically a part of the farm bill.
House Ag Committee Ranking Member Angie Craig, D-Minn., said those cuts could also potentially torpedo future farm bill negotiations.","It’s technically not a farm bill, but it will likely impact agriculture more than any other legislation. That is the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law July 4. The massive budget bill contains a slew of provisions normally included in a farm bill.

Chief among those are updates to the commodity title programs through 2031. Those changes will be implemented retroactively to the 2025 commodity year. Notably, farmers will not have to choose between Price Loss Coverage and Agricultural Risk Coverage this year. Instead, farmers will automatically receive payments for the higher of PLC or ARC at the county level. Beginning in crop year 2026, farmers will once again need to choose which program they wish to receive.

The budget bill includes high statutory reference prices for all commodity program crops, though the amounts vary from crop to crop. For example, the corn reference price increases 11% to $4.10 per bushel, while the soybean level increases about 19% to $10 per bushel.

“At a time of great uncertainty for the agriculture economy, the support of Congress to enhance key programs and vital domestic markets for our farmers is critical,” said Caleb Ragland, American Soybean Association president, following the bill’s passage in the House and Senate.

Ragland said ASA was pleased by revisions to the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, as well as additional funding for research and market expansion. Out of the $65.6 billion allocated to agriculture in the bill, more than $59 billion will go toward commodity programs and crop insurance. An additional $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion will support agriculture trade and research programs, respectively.

The $5.98 billion allocated to crop insurance will increase premium support by 3% to 5% across all coverage levels. Farmers enrolled in ARC will also be able to enroll in the Supplemental Coverage Option. Previously, only those enrolled in PLC were able to do so.

Beginning farmers and ranchers will now be eligible for additional premium support of up to 10 years. Before, they could only receive support for five.

Concern over nutrition cuts

Much of the additional ag funding was procured by cutting about $186 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which was fiercely opposed by Democrats. Funding for SNAP is typically a part of the farm bill. Opponents of the cuts say this will cause millions of families to go hungry.

According to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, up to 5.3 million families could lose benefits or see them reduced. House Ag Committee Ranking Member Angie Craig, D-Minn., said those cuts could also potentially torpedo future farm bill negotiations.

While much of the major spending normally in the farm bill is included in the new law, the legislation only covers certain permanently funded government programs. Other agriculture-related issues still need to be considered separately, potentially leading to contentious debates.

“Today, marks a grave turning point for our country, one which leaves rural communities and farmers behind, and places us on the road toward increased hunger, less prosperity and fewer opportunities for working families,” Craig said on July 3 shortly after Congress finalized the legislation. “This bill takes food away from millions of children, seniors, veterans and people with disabilities. Congressional Republicans have sold out ordinary Americans to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-rich and large corporations.”

Supporters of the bill counter nutrition funding cuts do not harm families. They argue some funds were being wasted, and others were going to “able-bodied” recipients who should be able to earn money on their own. House Ag Committee Chair Glenn “GT” Thompson, R-Pa., called the budget bill a “game-changer for America.”

“The One Big Beautiful Bill is a victory for rural America, making the largest investment in agriculture in decades, restoring integrity to SNAP, and saving millions of family farms from the death tax,” Thompson said in his own statement July 3. “This bill gives President Trump the tools he needs to keep America safe, strong and free.”

New tax rules stand to benefit farmers

Outside of the specific agriculture provisions in the budget bill, congressional efforts to ensure lower taxes were widely cheered by farm groups. The budget bill makes many tax cuts enacted in 2017 permanent. That includes the 20% qualified business income deduction, or Section 199A, as well as the $15 million estate tax exemption.

The bill also allows farmers to write off more expenses and depreciation costs. Eligibility for Section 45Z clean fuel production credits is now limited to fuels utilizing feedstock from the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

While the debate over passing the “big, beautiful bill” has ended, questions regarding its long-term impact will almost certainly drag on. The 870-page bill contains countless provisions that have received scant attention.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt8cb88247330a1a55/6883d9cbcc88782300b11c29/0721F1-5658_1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-25 15:56:21.225534

Those that don’t embrace climate innovation during this ESG lull will likely find themselves behind the curve in a few years’ time.","The ESG winter

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) frameworks emerged in the early 2000s as a means for investors to understand non-financial risks. They have been on a rollercoaster since then, with rapid growth despite challenges like the 2008 financial crash.

Following a surge of interest in the 2010s, when a host of companies made bold commitments in the wake of the Paris Agreement, hype grew even higher in the early 2020s.

But more recently, the second Trump administration has amplified a ‘war on ESG’ that was brewing in several states. Businesses are dialling back sustainability communications and, in some cases, weakening targets and tweaking strategic priorities.

As such, many are debating whether we’ve entered an ‘ESG winter’, with sustainable funds suffering record-high outflows.

For many in the climate sphere, alarm bells are ringing, with concerns that the sustainability and ESG agenda has lost its shine and is being pushed to the bottom of corporate agendas.

And this seeming blow to climate action isn’t limited to big companies – early-stage clean tech startups are similarly being left out in the cold, freezing, it seems, in the midst of this ESG winter.

Closing the cleantech funding gap

That innovation is essential for the net-zero transition is now a well-established fact; the technologies, systems, and ways of thinking that got us into this climate mess are not going to get us out of it.

The International Energy Agency estimates that around half of the emissions reductions and removals needed for a global net-zero energy system rely on innovations that are not yet commercially mature.

Despite this, and the fact that ‘innovation’ regularly features as a pillar of both national and organisational transition plans, financial interest in climate startups and solutions is waning.

After a boom in climate tech investment in 2021 and 2022, the trend is very much on the decline at a time when, more than ever, we need impactful climate solutions. Compared with the same period in 2024, funding in sustainability-related startups this year has declined by 46%.

Experts have highlighted that the UK is especially guilty of failing its cleantech innovators, namely in engineering biology, with a lack of financial support underpinning much of that failure. This funding gap is leaving countless climate tech startups stranded in the dreaded ‘valley of death’, unable to scale up and unleash the full potential of their potentially revolutionary ideas.

Innovation as the next frontier

Being so asset-heavy and requiring such high upfront costs, traditional venture capital (VC) firms seem increasingly reluctant to take bets on startups with long (and uncertain) return times.

As VC firms take their feet off the clean tech gas pedal, and governments either delay, reduce or axe financial support for new clean tech, corporates have a unique and pressing opportunity to step up.

Now may not be the time for companies with a US presence to be publicly celebrating their sustainability wins, but that’s not to say it’s time to stop moving behind the scenes in the name of resilience. Filling the clean tech funding gap could be the perfect, mutually beneficial way to maintain sustainability momentum.

In supporting earlier-stage clean tech startups, whether that’s through corporate VC or accelerator programmes, corporates aren’t just doing what’s right for the planet – although helping to bring these solutions to life at a time the Earth is crying out for change certainly feels like a noble cause.

They’re also giving themselves access to unique opportunities within the agile and dynamic world of startup innovation: early access to game-changing (and cost-saving) technologies, solutions to some of the most pressing business risks (including resource and energy scarcity), and the chance to demonstrate real-world impact.

Who’s getting it right?

As I’ve witnessed first-hand working within the editorial team on Springwise, there are myriad examples of companies investing in climate innovation and seeing great returns.

In 2015, when international technical apparel brand Goldwin first invested in Spiber, a Japanese company that uses microbial fermentation to create replacements for petrochemical or animal-based fibres, the firm was able to enter into a valuable research and development programme. This saw the creation of Spiber’s cutting-edge Brewed Protein materials, which Goldwin has since incorporated into its own collections.

Automaker JLR’s InMotion Ventures, meanwhile, chose to support Ascend Elements (formerly Battery Resourcers), which reclaims valuable materials from spent lithium-ion batteries to manufacture new components, in the startup’s 2021 series B funding round. It did so as it works towards a 2039 net-zero target. Ascend Elements has since reached so-called ‘unicorn’ status, surpassing $1bn in valuation.

Other success stories include Grover, a rental service for popular consumer electronics. In 2018, Samsung NEXT joined the startup’s series A financing round. The pair began a partnership just a couple of years later, which saw Grover offer Samsung devices on its site, enabling Samsung to tap into Grover’s e-waste-reducing, rent-not-buy model.

Elsewhere, steel and mining giant ArcelorMittal is capitalising on the investment it made into Form Energy, an MIT spinout that has developed an iron-air battery for grid-level energy storage. ArcelorMittal can supply Form Energy with the iron inputs it needs to manufacture its batteries, as Form Energy provides, in return, a reliable supply of green energy to the company’s steel plants.

Leading with action, not acronyms

CVC is not a new concept, but its financial impact still pales in comparison to traditional VCs – with CVC-backed funding reaching just shy of $66 billion in 2024, versus the $368 billion invested by global VCs. There’s a lot of room for CVC to grow.

Although the ESG landscape as we’ve come to know it over the last decade has shifted, the problems facing our planet are too massive for this sustainability winter not to thaw. Supporting startups may be one of the most impactful courses of action businesses can currently take.

Long gone are the days when sustainability was simply a tick-box exercise. Although reporting will continue to be an important tool for accountability, the companies that will reach net-zero emissions fastest will be those that are not just reporting on the change, but funding and accelerating it.

Rather than just looking backwards, as is necessary in the world of ESG compliance, innovation encourages businesses to look ahead. Those that don’t embrace climate innovation during this ESG lull will likely find themselves behind the curve in a few years’ time.

The announcements this week included Indonesia, Japan, and Australia.

These were the details specific to ag products:

Indonesia will ""address and prevent barriers to U.S. agricultural products in the Indonesian market,"" according to a White House fact sheet. That includes buying around $4.5 billion of soybeans, soybean meal, wheat, and cotton. Indonesia is already the U.S.’s fifth largest soybean trading partner by volume, according to the USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service.

“I’m doing a little celebration,” said Cassandra Kuball, vice president at Torrey Advisory Group, on the Indonesia agreement. “It’s great to see something come to fruition and give us a sense of what is able to, hopefully, be accomplished.”

Indonesia

American Soybean Association

The American Soybean Association (ASA) represents U.S. soybean farmers on domestic and international policy issues. ASA has 26 affiliate state associations representing 30 soybean-producing states and nearly 500,000 soybean farmers.

“We appreciate President Trump and his administration’s efforts in maintaining market access for U.S. soybeans into Indonesia, and the commitment from [United States Trade Representative] USTR to address non-tariff barriers in that market,” Caleb Ragland, American Soybean Association president and a Kentucky soybean farmer, said in a statement. “We look forward to future deals like this that reduce tariffs and ensure continued and increased market access for U.S. agriculture.”

National Milk Producers Federation

The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) “develops and carries out policies that advance dairy producers and the cooperatives they own. NMPF’s member cooperatives produce more than two-thirds of U.S. milk, making NMPF dairy’s voice on Capitol Hill and with government agencies.”

“This looks like it will be a significant win for U.S. dairy. We commend the Trump administration for securing an agreement that should deliver real benefits for our dairy farmers,” said Gregg Doud, president and CEO of NMPF. “We are pleased to hear this framework removes roadblocks to trade and will help grow dairy sales in one of the world’s most populous markets. NMPF looks forward to reviewing the details of the agreement and working with the administration to ensure Indonesia upholds its end of the bargain.”

Japan

National Corn Growers Association

Founded in 1957, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) represents more than 36,000 dues-paying corn growers in 48 states, and the interests of more than 300,000 farmers who contribute through corn checkoff programs in their state.

In response to the announcement, Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. made the following statement:

“We appreciate the work that the administration has dedicated to brokering a deal with Japan, worth $2.7 billion, and we welcome today’s announcement. Japan is the second-largest market for U.S. corn exports, and we support any effort to expand the purchase of corn and corn products, like ethanol. U.S. corn growers produce an abundant crop year in and year out, and NCGA has long advocated for increased access to foreign markets, which will support American farmers and rural economies.”

USA Rice Federation

USA Rice Federation (USA Rice) is the global advocate for all segments of the U.S. rice industry, with a mission to ensure the health and vitality of a unified U.S. rice industry by advocating on behalf of farmers, millers, merchants, and allied businesses.

“With this trade deal, President Trump has further solidified the importance of Japan as a market for high-quality U.S. rice,” said USA Rice President and CEO Peter Bachmann. “Japan is consistently among our top export markets in terms of both value and volume, but this will be the first opportunity since the 1990s to further that market access. We thank the president for continuing to prioritize additional rice market access throughout the negotiating process and we look forward to working with our Japanese counterparts on the implementation of the agreement.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has represented Louisiana’s fourth district since 2016.

“I was with President Trump in the Oval tonight as he negotiated this historic deal!” Johnson posted to X. “This deal with Japan will bring a $550 billion investment in America, hundreds of thousands of jobs, and a huge increase in trade between our two countries.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, has represented New York since 1998.

“Like most of his ‘deals,’ it was big on promises, short on detail, and provided zero relief for American families and small businesses,” Schumer said on X. “The Trump tariff taxes keep going up, not down. That means one thing: higher costs for American families.”

Australia

Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins

USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins issued a statement congratulating President Trump on the Australia announcement.

“American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world,” she said. “It’s absurd that non-scientific trade barriers prevented our beef from being sold to consumers in Australia for the last 20 years. Gone are the days of putting American farmers on the sidelines. This is yet another example of the kind of market access the president negotiates to bring America into a new golden age of prosperity, with American agriculture leading the way.”

National Cattlemen’s Beef Association

The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA) has represented America's cattle producers since 1898 and is the largest association of cattle producers in the United States.

“For 20 years, U.S. beef was denied access to Australia while Australia exported $29 billion of beef to U.S. consumers. The lack of two-way, science-based trade has been a sticking point for many years, and we are pleased that President Trump has successfully opened the Australian market to American beef,” NCBA President and Nebraska cattleman Buck Wehrbein said. “NCBA has spent decades working to correct this trade imbalance and we are proud to have a president who is willing to fight for American farmers and ranchers, expand export markets, and fix unfair trade agreements across the world.”

“The United States is the gold standard for safe and delicious beef, and we have some of the highest animal health and food safety standards in the world,” NCBA Executive Director of Government Affairs Kent Bacus added. “Opening the Australian market to American beef will benefit our producers at home, while also offering Australian consumers the opportunity to enjoy our high-quality beef.”",https://www.agriculture.com/thmb/_3RtjRl50BwpdwUPUR-lJGXoZ3A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/anthony-mucci-glo_zQOnXf4-unsplash-001344dbf396434c8b185a1e184d6498.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 14:56:18.008212

While 45Z primarily benefits fuel producers, the recent updates offer new clarity and opportunities for U.S. farmers — if challenges can be addressed in time.

The 45Z credit applies to clean fuels produced after December 31, 2024, and was originally set to expire in 2027. Under OBBBA, it’s now extended through 2029, giving biofuel producers more time to invest in clean fuel technology.

But the real impact for agriculture lies in how carbon intensity is calculated and which feedstocks qualify. Using the Department of Energy’s 45ZCF-GREET model, emissions are assessed from field to fuel tank. The lower the CI score, the higher the credit — ranging from 20 cents to $1 per gallon.

Key changes under OBBBA include:

Exclusion of indirect land use change from GREET calculations

Feedstocks must be sourced from North America

Fuels must be produced by U.S.-controlled firms

Elimination of extra premiums for sustainable aviation fuel

Increased credits for small producers

These updates aim to reward clean practices while cracking down on credit abuse, such as imported used cooking oil misclassified for higher payouts.

Farm-Level Impacts: New Demand, More Strings

Even though farmers don’t directly receive 45Z credits, demand for corn, soybeans, crop residues, and other feedstocks is expected to rise. USDA projects 35% of U.S. corn in 2025 will go to ethanol, while over 50% of soybean oil will be used in biofuels.

But there’s a catch: feedstocks must come from low-carbon farming practices — like no-till, cover crops, and nutrient-efficient fertilizers — to help fuel producers lower their CI scores and qualify for higher credits.

“Traditionally produced corn, with a standard CI score of 29.1, wouldn’t qualify,” explain Samantha Ayoub and Faith Parum, American Farm Bureau Federation economists. “However, incorporating conservation practices can improve CI scores and unlock eligibility.”

This creates potential for premium contracts between fuel producers and farmers. Still, these arrangements may include costly certification requirements and limit a farmer’s flexibility. As Ayoub and Parum note, “These contracts may also come with burdensome and costly certification requirements… locking farmers into specific production practices.”

Challenges in implementation

While the intent of 45Z is clear, implementation is not. The Department of Treasury and IRS must still issue new guidance, and USDA is finalizing which conservation practices qualify.

Currently, adoption of these practices is still low:

Cover crops: ~5% of cropland

Reduced tillage: ~25%

No-till: ~28%

Even if fuel producers are eager to offer contracts, Ayoub and Parum warn, “Without guarantees that their investments will be returned through crop premiums or credit passthroughs, it will likely be slow going to grow eligible feedstock acres.”

OBBBA’s changes to 45Z open the door for more demand for domestic feedstocks and provide a framework that favors U.S. farmers — if policies and compensation mechanisms fall into place quickly.",https://www.agdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/shutterstock_1218071932.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 13:56:27.970911

Despite these challenges, aviation plays a critical role in the global fight against climate change, currently accounting for 3% of total greenhouse gas emissions. This impact is set to grow in the coming decades. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), global air travel demand is expected to surge, with passenger traffic projected to reach 19.5 billion by 2042—more than double the volume recorded in 2024.

Addressing aviation emissions has become increasingly urgent in the global effort to meet climate targets. In response, the aviation industry has made an international commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. According to a study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the most viable pathway to reaching this goal is through the widespread adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAFs are renewable or waste-derived fuels that meet strict sustainability criteria and are designed to serve as drop-in replacements for conventional jet fuels. Unlike more capital-intensive solutions—such as retrofitting existing aircraft or developing entirely new technologies—SAFs require minimal changes to current aircraft and infrastructure. This makes them one of the most practical and promising tools for decarbonizing aviation in the near to mid-term.

SAF can be produced from a diverse array of feedstocks, including ethanol, used cooking oils and greases, and agricultural or forestry residues. Compared to conventional jet fuel, SAF offers a significant reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—by as much as 80%. To date, 11 production pathways have been certified for SAF, with the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) process, which converts ethanol into jet fuel, emerging as one of the most promising and scalable options.

Brazil is already a global leader in the use of biofuels for ground transportation and is now advancing efforts to produce SAF. These initiatives include not only SAF derived from ethanol but also from biomethane, which is obtained through the purification of biogas. Biogas represents a new frontier in renewable energy, generated from by-products of ethanol and sugar production—such as vinasse and filter cake—making the process both sustainable and circular.

Furthermore, a recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) identified Brazil as the Latin American country with the greatest potential to produce SAF at the largest scale and lowest cost (ranging from $1.11 to $1.77/liter). This positions Brazil not only to meet regional demand but also to contribute significantly to global supply.

The growth potential of the SAF market is immense, as it currently accounts for less than 0.5% of all aviation fuel use. However, several challenges must be overcome to unlock its full potential in decarbonizing the sector and phasing out fossil fuels. According to a report by the World Economic Forum, the primary obstacles to aviation decarbonization are the limited availability and high cost of SAF. Addressing these challenges will require strong public policy frameworks and substantial investment. ICAO estimates that approximately $3.2 trillion in investment will be required to scale up cleaner aviation fuel production and achieve its goal of net-zero emissions from international aviation by 2050.

A coordinated global effort is essential to establish stable policy frameworks that foster long-term markets, attract investment, and drive technological innovation in SAF. The upcoming COP30 in Belém presents a pivotal opportunity for governments, industry, and civil society to come together and help to build the financial and regulatory foundation SAF needs to scale. By aligning investment, public policy, and international cooperation, the world can lay the groundwork for SAF to become a cornerstone of decarbonized aviation—and take a decisive step toward a more sustainable, low-carbon future.",https://www.sugarcane.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SAF.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 16:56:26.854828

The airline became the world’s first to integrate solar fuel, developed by the clean-tech company Synhelion, in its regular flight operations. It marks a pivotal step towards reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

Clean Fuel From the Sun

Synhelion produces sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from sunlight. The process reportedly harnesses concentrated solar heat to create syngas (synthesis gas), which is then synthesized into kerosene through industrial methods. Synhelion calls it “sun-to-liquid” fuel, saying it closes the carbon cycle. According to the company, its combustion only releases CO2 that was absorbed during the manufacturing process.

Synhelion delivered a 190-liter barrel of synthetic crude oil derived from solar energy. The company transported it to a refinery in Northern Germany, where it was processed into certified Jet-A-1 aviation fuel. SWISS “seamlessly” integrated the fuel into its operational infrastructure at Hamburg Airport in Germany.

The smooth integration of the solar fuel confirmed that the technology is ready for broader applications.

“This first delivery of Synhelion’s solar fuel marks a genuine milestone in our long-standing partnership,” said SWISS CEO Jens Fehlinger. “We have intentionally invested in a Swiss start-up, and we are delighted to celebrate this landmark achievement together.”

Fehlinger noted that this is the first time solar fuel has been used in civil aviation. “We are truly proud to be playing such a pioneering role, in partnership with Synhelion, in driving and developing this vital new technology for a more sustainable aviation sector,” the CEO added.

Philipp Furler, co-founder and co-CEO of Synhelion, emphasized the fuel’s potential to secure a sustainable future for the aviation industry.

A Sustainable Future

“This milestone brings us one step closer to globally scaling up our solar fuel technology,” he said. “And we’re very grateful to have such invaluable support from our partners at SWISS and the Lufthansa Group as we continue on this journey.”

As the two companies focus on the future, they realize how important sustainable fuels like Synhelion’s solar fuel will be for the aviation sector. Specifically, to meet ambitious carbon reduction goals. Looking ahead, the companies must develop factories for continuous production and scaling capacities. They believe the fuel will hit the commercial market in 2027.

However, the next immediate step is getting both the production process and the fuel sustainably certified.",https://www.tomorrowsworldtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/swiss-solar-fuel.png,N,,2025-07-25 12:56:23.232029

Boom Supersonic has attracted 130 orders, “pre-orders” and options from American Airlines, United and Japan Airlines.
Earlier this year the Colorado company’s supersonic test bed, known as XB1, became the first independently-funded jet to break the sound barrier.
Nostalgia for the supersonic flight has been particularly notable this week – 25 years after the Concorde Air France crash.
“Sustainable supersonic travel unlocks new possibilities for business relationships, prospects for vacation and opportunities for human connection.”","“Our ultimate goal is to bring the benefits of supersonic flight to everyone” – so says Blake Scholl, founder and chief executive of Boom Supersonic.

His company, based in Denver, is at the forefront of the race to find a successor to Concorde. The chosen name: Overture.

“Flights onboard Overture will cut travel times in half, ushering in the next era of faster travel,” the firm says. Boom Supersonic has attracted 130 orders, “pre-orders” and options from American Airlines, United and Japan Airlines.

Earlier this year the Colorado company’s supersonic test bed, known as XB1, became the first independently-funded jet to break the sound barrier.

Boom Supersonic says its production plane, known as Overture, will fly at 60,000 feet, the same as Concorde. The speed, Mach 1.7, is one-sixth slower – but still twice as fast as subsonic aircraft. It claims London-New York will take three hours 45 minutes, comparable with Concorde’s historic schedule.

Nostalgia for the supersonic flight has been particularly notable this week – 25 years after the Concorde Air France crash.

But had Concorde not been taken out of service on commercial grounds, it would surely by now have been grounded because of the environmental damage. On a London-New York trip, it would deafen bystanders at either end of the route and burn through 100 tons of aviation fuel; a Boeing 787 carries three times as many passengers for half as much fuel.

Boom Supersonic can fly on 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), though critics question the claimed benefits of this scarce substance.

A clue to a noisier environmental problem lies in the name: Boom. Concorde was unable to fly faster than the speed of sound overland because of the shockwave that supersonic aircraft create – which is experienced as a thunder-like boom by a person who is on the ground.

Boom Supersonic believes it has come up with a solution: reducing the aircraft’s speed while flying over land to about Mach 1.2. “By flying at a sufficiently high altitude at an appropriate speed for current atmospheric conditions, Overture’s sonic boom never reaches the ground,” the firm says.

“When in Boomless Cruise, speeds are 40-50 per cent faster than conventional airliners. This means a flight from New York to Los Angeles can be up to 90 minutes shorter.

“At top speeds of Mach 1.7, flight times are twice as fast and sonic booms are only created over water.”

The range will be 4,890 miles – only about one-sixth more than Concorde’s maximum, but opening up many more potential routes such as London to Miami, Los Angeles to Lima and Brisbane to Tokyo. Boom Supersonic says potentially there are more than 600 “profitable routes” worldwide.

While Concorde fares were typically about 20 per cent higher than subsonic first class, Boom Supersonic says it expects airlines operating Overture will profitable with fares at business to first class levels.

One of Boom’s advisory council is Captain Mike Bannister, former Concorde chief pilot. He says: “I’ve been waiting over 20 years for an environmentally friendly successor to Concorde and XB-1’s supersonic flight is a major landmark towards my dreams being realised.

“When I last flew Concorde in 2003 I knew that this day would come.”

But senior aviation executive Jonathan Hinkles believes the ways of the travel world have changed dramatically over the past 22 years – and that Zoom could pose problems for Boom.

He told The Independent’s daily travel podcast: “If you look at what Concorde did, it was a way of being able to leave London at 7pm, arrive in New York at 5.50pm, so you'd be basically travelling through time to arrive in New York before the flight had left London in local time.

“But of course, today we've got Zoom, we've got Teams. A lot of business meetings that were the bedrock of why people flew on Concorde don't actually require people to fly anymore.

“The market that supported Concorde through its life has moved on fundamentally. I just can't see that there's an economic case for a successor. For the foreseeable future we're going to be very much confined to flying around at 550mph.”

Lyn Hughes, founding editor of Wanderlust magazine, concurs: “I think the public are less concerned now with the speed of the flights than they are with other factors: safety, convenience, reliability, value for money and comfort.

“The real revolution now would be a better experience at the airport pre and post the flight, and a comfortable experience on it – and, of course, for a more sustainable, carbon-free flight.”

But Blake Scholl, CEO of Boom Supersonic, is convinced speed will prevail: “We believe in a world where more people can go to more places more often.

The new reality is sobering: feedstock constraints, unresolved technology challenges and fragmented global policies are stalling progress.

Today, SAF still accounts for only 0.3% of jet fuel use globally and industry experts warn it could take 15 years or more before production scales sufficiently ‒ and costs drop low enough ‒ for SAF to be viable without heavy government subsidies. Current trajectories suggest SAF might address just 20% of aviation fuel needs by 2050. Without a dramatic acceleration in production and supportive policy shifts ‒ even low-hanging fruit such as SAF-specific carbon accounting or “book and claim” mechanisms under the GHG Protocol ‒ the dream of SAF delivering the lion’s share of emissions reductions is slipping away.

Unless the industry confronts the economics head-on and policymakers step in to close the gap, SAF contribution to net zero will be considerably less ‒ it’ll be a luxury fuel with a green premium.

Market-based measures like carbon offsets function in aviation as they do across industries ‒ enabling the purchase of verified carbon reductions through projects such as reforestation or carbon capture. Typically considered a last resort after all other decarbonization strategies are deployed (see Exhibit 2), offsets can be voluntarily bought by airlines, consumers or corporations. Regulatory programs like the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and CORSIA may soon require mandatory offset purchases if emissions targets are not met. Despite their role, these market-based solutions will always carry a green premium.

Despite growing climate awareness, only a small fraction of consumers is willing to pay extra to shrink their carbon footprint. Who ultimately bears the cost of green premiums will hinge on regulatory mandates, market pressure and how much companies ‒ and their stakeholders ‒ are prepared to absorb or shift those costs downstream. A carbon price may nudge the balance, but it won’t erase the fundamental economic reality: green still costs more, and someone has to pay.

Operational and infrastructure upgrades can unlock “green discounts” by cutting fuel use, lowering emissions and optimizing flight operations. These range from reduced taxiing times and smarter routing between airports to continuous climb/descent and weather-optimized flight paths. Programs like NextGen in the US and SESAR in Europe aim to deliver such efficiencies. However, legacy systems, budget constraints and the complexity of change management mean emissions reductions from these efforts may likely meet ‒ but not exceed ‒ current projections. While critical for safety and capacity amid growing demand, their role in reaching net zero will be limited.

For technology improvements to make a substantially larger contribution to achieving net zero, industry would need to overcome at least three impediments that are intertwined.

Technology readiness and integration

Aviation needs transformative breakthroughs ‒ revolutionary aircraft architectures like blended wing bodies and truss-braced wings offer up to 50% fuel burn reduction through dramatic aerodynamic gains. But realizing their potential comes with steep integration challenges: cabin layout, pressurization, emergency egress and regulatory certification remain unresolved. When paired with innovations in conventional propulsion (e.g., geared turbofans, open rotors) or alternative power systems (e.g., hybrid-electric, hydrogen combustion, fuel cells), next-generation materials (e.g., advanced composites, 3D printing, morphing surfaces) and digital/autonomous systems, the pathway to step-change efficiency becomes viable. Yet, several of these technologies remain largely immature today. The industry must break away from multidecade innovation cycles and embrace faster, bolder development, validation and commercialization pathways.

Development and certification duration

Today’s aircraft development timeline ‒ often 10 years or more from launch to entry into service ‒ is too slow for the scale of transformation needed. Model-based engineering, digital twins and AI-assisted design enable faster iterations and smarter trade-offs. These tools can drastically reduce the time required to design, simulate, test and certify new aircraft. If harnessed effectively, they could enable more frequent introductions of clean-sheet designs and faster replacement of legacy fleets.

Business case viability

The current business model in the industry is rooted in a 40+ year aircraft program lifecycle. Given the high development cost, manufacturers in most aircraft subsystem segments depend on the lucrative aftermarket – which starts around 7+ years and peaks 15+ years post-entry into service of a new program. Unfortunately, this also exacerbates the challenges that systems providers take on, which can reduce the appetite for the risk inherent in a radically new (and potentially more sustainable) design.

Profit pools are unevenly distributed across the value chain ‒ systems providers and component manufacturers often capture more economic profit than airframers or airlines. Airframers desire to capture a larger portion of the value created, while systems OEMs would like to lower risk and improve timing of value realization and payback. Airlines prefer a low acquisition cost of aircraft but also want less ambiguity in lifecycle cost, which is intensified by new technologies and increasing operations in a harsher environment. This confluence of profitability, risk and uncertainty-related challenges across the value chain could open the door for more equitable or disruptive business models with implications.

If airframers were to capture a larger portion of program value and economic profit, they could increase the frequency of new aircraft model introductions with higher fuel efficiency. In which case, systems providers, particularly propulsion system providers, would have to contend with a shorter lifecycle, requiring their business model to rely on initial sale instead of aftermarket revenue. The total cost of ownership would need to remain comparable to current models, while increased upfront cost would be offset by lower fuel and maintenance costs for airlines. The initial sale profitability could balance out the significant long-term risk of the existing model.

Airlines would, of course, benefit from the lower operational costs related to fuel but will likely seek alternate options to address the higher acquisition cost for propulsion and other major aircraft systems. Financial sponsors may leverage their balance sheet strength to offer availability-based models, providing flexibility for airlines to make operational and capacity decisions.

A question remains of whether airframers and systems providers can remain profitable with a shorter program run, where new technology introductions trigger planes to retire at 20 years rather than 30 years. We have seen this play out effectively in business aviation. Can this transfer to commercial aviation? Achieving net zero may rely on it.",https://www.ey.com/content/dam/ey-unified-site/ey-com/en-us/insights/aerospace-defense/images/ey-an-engineer-focuses-on-complex-aircraft-designs-displayed-across-multiple-screens.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 15:56:24.085342

Losing 45V tax credits is likely to seriously erode the economic viability of many hydrogen projects in the country, with Louisiana set to feel the heat the most. The state’s 46 hydrogen and ammonia-related projects are currently eligible for the credits. Louisiana is home to some of the biggest hydrogen projects in the United States, including Clean Hydrogen Works' $7.5 billion ammonia and blue hydrogen projects as well as Air Products (NYSE:APD)' $4.5 billion blue hydrogen plant.

However, OBBBA is not solely to blame for the stalling hydrogen sector, with dozens of green hydrogen developers across the globe scaling back investments or scrapping them altogether thanks to weak demand for the low-carbon fuel coupled with soaring production costs.

Last year, U.S. startup Hy Stor Energy canceled its reservation for over 1 gigawatt of electrolyzer capacity with Nel, a Norwegian electrolyzer manufacturer, for its Mississippi Clean Hydrogen Hub project. The company said the move was due to market headwinds and delays in bringing the project to fruition, making it financially unfeasible to make upcoming capacity reservation payments. However, Hy Stor said it was not canceling the hydrogen hub itself.

Back in February, Allentown, Pennsylvania-based Air Products announced plans to cancel several green hydrogen projects in the U.S., including a $500 million facility in New York and a sustainable aviation fuel project in California. These decisions are part of the company’s broader $3.1 billion write-down and are driven by challenging commercial and regulatory factors, including the need to strengthen the company's focus on projects that deliver value for shareholders.

Not even Europe’s energy heavyweights have been spared the carnage.

Last year, we reported that Shell Plc. (NYSE:SHEL) had scrapped plans to build a low-carbon hydrogen plant in Norway citing lack of demand, days before Norway’s NOC Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) announced similar plans, ""We haven't seen the market for blue hydrogen materialize and decided not to progress the project,"" a Shell spokesperson has told Reuters.

BP Plc. (NYSE:BP) said in April that it was abandoning its hydrogen ambitions in favor of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for transport. This week, BP announced that it will exit the $36-billion green hydrogen production facility planned in Australia. BP has informed its Australian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) partners that it will leave its role as the project’s operator and equity holder.

Last year, Spain’s Iberdrola (OTCPK:IBDRY)(OTCPK:IBDSF), Europe's largest utility, said it would scale back its green hydrogen investments by almost two thirds due to funding delays for some projects. The company cut its 2030 production target to ~120,000 tons of green hydrogen a year, down from its previous goal of 350,000 tons.

Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal S.A. (NYSE:MT) has abandoned plans to convert two of its steel plants in Germany to hydrogen, despite the steelmaker being offered 1.3 billion euros in public subsidies for the 2.5 billion euro ($2.9 billion) project.

Meanwhile, back in February, Spain's Repsol (OTCQX: REPYY) scaled back its 2030 green hydrogen production target, cutting it by as much as 63%. The company's new target is between 0.7 and 1.2 gigawatts (GW) of electrolyzer capacity, down from a previous goal of 1.9 GW. Repsol cited challenges in market development, regulatory uncertainties, and the high cost of green hydrogen production, particularly without subsidies.

The Australian market has been hard hit, too. In September 2024, Woodside Energy (NYSE:WDS), the country’s largest independent oil and gas producer, shelved plans to build two green hydrogen projects in Australia and New Zealand.

In March this year, giant oil and commodities trader Trafigura, ditched plans to build a green hydrogen plant at the company’s Port Pirie lead smelter in South Australia for A$750 million ($491.5 million).

Meanwhile, the Queensland state government pulled the plug on plans to fund a A$12.5 billion green hydrogen plant by 2028, with the massive project slated to become one of Australia’s largest and most advanced green hydrogen projects.

Finally, Japan's Kawasaki Heavy Industries announced it will not go ahead with its coal-to-hydrogen project in Latrobe, Australia, citing time and cost pressures.

The mounting cancellations suggest a sector still searching for viable economics, not just policy certainty. While OBBBA’s accelerated tax credit deadline has undoubtedly raised the stakes for U.S. developers, the global pullback points to deeper market fractures: low offtake demand, high capital costs, and insufficient infrastructure. With major players in the U.S., Europe, and Australia walking away or scaling back, the once-hyped green hydrogen boom is looking more like a trickle. For now.

ATC Charges Cut and effect in Cost-Cutting of Passenger Fare Price

All it knows is that it is going to cut air traffic control charges massively and is going to reform the existing air tax system. This amendment is one of many steps to enhance the connectivity and lower the costs of travel in the industry and keep Germany competitive as a leading aerotransport hub in Europe. The changes are also aimed at better reflecting environmental goals established by the EU Green Deal.

At present, Germany has some of the highest air passenger taxes in Europe, which many airlines and tourism boards believe acts as a deterrent to flying and the economic recovery of the travel industry. In reconsidering these taxes, the federal government hopes to help both the aviation sector and travelers.

Key Measures and Timeline

Cuts to the aviation taxes will come into effect in January 2026 subject to approval and legislative process. This comes after discussions with industry, including airlines, airport operators, and consumer groups. The proposed adjustments include:

Reducing the existing tiered air passenger tax

Introduction of incentives for the use of low-emission or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

Lowering charges on short-haul flights within the EU area

Increasing subsidies for regional airports

The measures are designed to deliver short-term relief to passengers while promoting more sustainable aviation in the long-run.

Impact on Travelers and Airlines

Travelers will benefit in the form of cheaper ticket prices, particularly on domestic and intra-European routes, as a result of the lower air taxes. Winged wallets and holiday-makers on a budget are likely to be the biggest winners from the reform, which could prompt a renewed wave of short- and medium-haul bookings from as early as 2026.

Carriers in Germany, especially those with low-cost business models, should benefit from increased demand. Some carriers such as Eurowings, Lufthansa Group units and Ryanair have lobbied for years against Germany’s high aviation fees, saying they stifle growth and push operations out of the country to neighbors.

The reform should help take away the financial incentive for airlines to run their operations from abroad, and to develop the major airports in Germany such as Frankfurt, Munich and Berlin.

Competitive Edge in European Aviation Industry

The new approach is also in response to what other countries in the vicinity of the UK are doing in relation to aviation taxation. For example, Spain recently declared a freeze in air passenger duty and France made available grants for green travel. Germany has been liberalising to try to level the playing field and boost the competitiveness of its airports across Europe.

Germany experienced a 14.2 per cent rise in air passengers during 2024 over the previous year, figures from the country’s federal statistical office Destatis show. Analysts think the policy change could spur more growth, particularly if consumers are cost-conscious in an age of rapidly rising inflation and travel demand.

Support for Environmental Sustainability

Affordability is the end all, be all of the tax cut, but the environment is still a major focus. The government has confirmed that airlines that fly using sustainable aviation fuels, or that operate newer fuel-efficient planes, will also get more of a benefit in the new scheme. It also fits into the EU’s broader decarbonization ambitions for transport and aviation.

Under the “Fit for 55” package of legislative proposals, the EU aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. The reform of the German aviation tax is supposed to be a set up that ensures that it pays off for airlines to act sustainably.

Industry Response of the Advent of Cost- Effective Airlines

Airlines are broadly supportive of the notice. The German Aviation Association (BDL) said the reform would be a welcome relief for carriers operating in a cutthroat European market. Leaders in the travel industry also emphasized the prospects of more inbound tourism and improved regional linkages.

Consumer advocates, meanwhile, are cautiously optimistic. Equally, they welcome lower operating costs for travel, but demand transparency over how these cost-savings will be passed on to the consumer and the need for continued investment in sustainability.

Looking Ahead for the development of German Airline Industry

The plans are part of a long-term vision by Germany to deliver a more equal spread of economic growth, consumer welfare and environmental responsibility in the country’s aviation industry. By lates 2025, when legislative frameworks are expected to be put in place, stakeholders will be watching carefully to see how the prices of air tickets, the volume of flights, and carbon reduction targets are affected by the new policies.

Projects in Hydrogen Allocation Round 1 (HAR1) span the UK and involve producing hydrogen for a range of industries, including mining, aviation and transportation.

The projects are expected to create more than 700 jobs during construction and operation including jobs for apprentices, graduates, and engineers.

HAR1 projects will have access to £2bn (US$2.7bn) of support over 15 years from the Hydrogen Production Business Model, and more than £90m in capital expenditure from the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund. A further £400m of private investment has been committed to these projects.

Clare Jackson, the CEO of trade body Hydrogen UK said: “Signing these contracts demonstrates the confidence and commitment of both the government and industry in building a sustainable hydrogen sector.”

Regional projects

The projects were first picked up by the government in December of last year before being agreed on by the Low Carbon Contracts Company – a government body tasked with securing private investment for green energy projects in the UK. It also leads the Contracts for Difference scheme.

The projects in HAR1 includes the Langage green hydrogen project in Plymouth, operated by renewable energy firm Carlton Power. The project intends to develop a green hydrogen plant with an initial capacity of 10 MW, to supply hydrogen to industrial facilities in the region. Carlton Power says that the hydrogen produced by the initial 10 MW plant will reduce CO2 emissions in Plymouth by more than 7,000 t annually.

EDF and its hydrogen subsidiary Hynamics is developing the Tees Green hydrogen project in Redcar, Teesside. Hydrogen will be produced from electricity generated from the Teesside Offshore Wind Farm – which has a capacity of 62 MW – and used to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

Another is the HyMarnham project in Newark, jointly backed byGeoPura and animal food waste processor JG Pears. The project involves the development of a hydrogen production facility situated at a former coal fired power station and powered by 43 MW of solar power and 8 MW of electrolysers. GeoPura will use the hydrogen to supply their remote power generation units, whereas JG Pears will use it to power its waste disposal operations.

Alistair Collins, director of HyMarnham Power, said: “As one of the first HAR1 projects now commissioning electrolyser systems, we’re proud to demonstrate what government support can unlock.”

The government expect HAR1 projects to be online between 2025 and April 2028. It has also shortlisted 27 projects for HAR2, with the confirmed projects to be announced next year.",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/22780/hydrogen.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-07-25 11:56:14.546274

Sweden has taken such an advanced step all thanks to Heart Aerospace, a Swedish startup in the aerospace industry. The startup’s hybrid-electric aircraft, the ES-30 utilizes the perfect fuel to enable it to takeoff and this is a fuel that beats hydrogen and electricity. Being used in the ES-30 is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a type of clean-burning fuel that allows aircrafts to fly without being plagued by the guilt of having caused harm to the climate. Swedish engineering is behind this incredible SAF.

Understanding SAF and what it means for flights?

All thanks to Swedish development, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has offered an alternative fuel option, and this fuel is created using cooking oil, algae, as well as agricultural waste. CO₂ emissions are fully reduced by 80% making the fuel one of the best alternatives for carbon.

SAF is seen as the most desirable fuel as it is compatible with aircraft infrastructure in that are already in existence. This fuel source can be effortlessly blended with traditional jet fuel and can be adapted to modern jet engines without requiring any adjustments.

This new SAF fuel by Swedish engineers works well with extended-range propulsion systems and it becomes evident in the ES-30 aircraft which can fly to about 800 kilometers when utilizing SAF in reserve generators. In battery-only mode, the aircraft can merely fly to about 200 kilometers. Only the best technologies have been combined.

The hybrid-electric combination

Sweden made its mark in terms of ensuring cleaner cities, but Sweden is now establishing itself as a leader in the aerospace industry that is also moving towards a cleaner climate agenda. The Gothenburg-based company, Heart Aerospace surely is making its mark by engineering the ES-30 which is a 30-seat hybrid-electric aircraft more geared towards short haul flights.

The Heart X1 was revealed in 2024, and it was the model meant specifically for ground testing. The full electric test flight will take place in 2025, and the idea is for hybrid-electric flights to follow shortly thereafter in 2026. Thus, the ES-30 will result in takeoffs leaving behind no emissions. The ES-30 will be greater for shorter routes.

This overall design makes it possible for aircrafts like the ES-30 to takeoff from smaller airports and this has increased the need for new regional airports. Since innovative agency, Vinnova, supports the ES-30, this ES-30 boasts some locally developed technologies that will improve lifting and lead to noise reductions.

600 kW to soar the skies offering a cleaner than hydrogen alternative that is more powerful than conventional fuels, ZeroAvia, too, is taking the cleaner fuel agenda to the skies and Sweden surely is following suit.

Sweden’s newer aviation motive: global and local benefits

Sweden is occupied with not only creating a future pathway for the global aviation industry but seems to be testing and utilizing such cleaner agenda at home. SAS, Swedavia, and Braathens Regional Airlines are contributing to such operational trials. Hybrid-electric flights is perhaps a dream come true and not just a dream far out of reach.

On the global front, AirAsia, Southeast Asia’s low-cost airline, has joined forces with Heart Aerospace’s Industry Advisory Board securing 250 firm orders for the ES-30, and it looks as if the 250-order amount is soon to increase to 500.

Sustainable flying- not only an option for Sweden

SAF spells better reliability and range while electric propulsion seems best for the short haul. Sweden is offering passengers the chance to fly without the worry of harming the climate in any way when they fly. The ES-30 is not at all merely a plane, it is setting the way forward for sustainable air travel options and Sweden is establishing its mark at the finish line.",https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/22-7-2025_214226_heartaerospace.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 11:56:17.799789

Unlike cars or homes, planes can’t easily switch to be electrified and the fuels they burn release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Globally, aviation accounts for about 2 percent to 3 percent of emissions, but it’s a fast-growing sector with limited alternatives.

Many emerging clean-energy technologies aim to replace fossil-fuel production with sustainable aviation fuels and eFuels but these solutions are still expensive, energy-intensive and not yet ready for mass deployment.

“Our goal is to revolutionize how we produce clean fuels for aviation, using renewable energy to transform CO2 into usable fuels without requiring costly infrastructure changes,” said Daiyan, a Scientia fellow in the School of Mineral and Energy Resources Engineering and lead chief investigator at UNSW. “This technology could be the key to decarbonizing aviation, one of the world’s most challenging sectors.”

Amal, from the School of Chemical Engineering, added, “This breakthrough proves that with smart catalyst design and integrated system thinking, we can transform waste CO2 into the very fuels that drive our economy. It’s the kind of scalable innovation we need to tackle hard-to-abate sectors and achieve net zero.”

The grant from TRaCE will help to move the technology from technology-readiness level (TRL) 4, which is proof-of-concept in the lab, to TRL 6 (validated prototype in a relevant environment).

A spin-out company, Gurung Fuel, led by the industry partners has been created to lead commercialization, stakeholder engagement and capital raising.

“This partnership is a major step towards scaling the cutting-edge electrolyzer technology. We're not just developing a solution, we are creating a game-changer for the aviation industry, with the potential to make a global impact,” Yun said.

The research project is a strategic opportunity for Australia, which is facing a critical challenge in its fuel security.

Currently, the nation holds only 48 days’ worth of fuel reserves—far below the 90 days required by international standards.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_25bd988c65de4d18b106205849ef0514~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_840,h_559,al_c,lg_1,q_85/80995f_25bd988c65de4d18b106205849ef0514~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-07-25 13:57:03.576771

So do inset programs such as SWOF and others, which pay farmers for improving water quality.","Ever wish you could be paid for the way you farm?

These days, you certainly can.

Payment for carbon and sequestering or squelching greenhouse gases to produce low-carbon fuels spurred by Section 45Z and accompanying tax credits may soon be reality. They join “offset” and “inset” programs that firms currently offer to farmers.

Offset programs pay farmers using practices such as cover crops that “offset” greenhouse gases that companies produce in manufacturing products. Inset programs occur when a firm works with its own supply chain or that of other companies to reduce a carbon footprint.

The Bayer Carbon Program has both inset and offset customers, says Alyssa Cho, Bayer sustainable agriculture field team lead. It pays farmers for sustainable practices they are already using on their own farm, such as reduced tillage or cover crops.

“We pay $6 per practice per year dating back to the fall of 2019,” Cho says. “We've also added a nitrogen-reduction offer that pays an additional $4 per acre.”

The Bayer Carbon Program contract is for five years. If a grower decides to sign up again at the end of the contract, Bayer offers another $6-per-acre bonus. Either Bayer or the farmer can exit the program before the contract expires.

Inset programs

The Soil and Water Outcomes Fund (SWOF) is an inset program that works with public and private organizations to achieve sustainability goals. It pays farmers who have implemented or expanded conservation to achieve environmental outcomes such as carbon sequestration, emission reductions and water-quality improvement.

It offers one-year contracts for practices such as:

Its average annual payout in 2024 was $33 per acre for participating farmers.

VARIETY OF PAYMENTS: Farmers can be paid for a variety of practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as reduced tillage or cover crops.

Carbon intensification scoring

What direction payments may take from Section 45Z federal tax credits hinges on regulations issued by the Treasury Department. It has not issued such regulations.

“The ethanol [biofuel] company is going to capture a lot of that value, perhaps the majority of it,” says Sean McMahon, head of U.S. sustainability for FarmersEdge. “But there's still substantial value there for farmers. There’s a premium for low-carbon grain, and that value is going to exceed carbon offsets or carbon insets based on the voluntary carbon market today.”

The tax credit’s worth is based on a carbon intensification (CI) score that tracks the biofuel supply chain’s carbon footprint. The more greenhouse gas-cutting practices a farmer adopts, the more he or she could potentially glean in payments from the tax credit passed on by the biofuel producer.

“What I love about CI scoring is it represents a snapshot of a particular crop in a particular field for a specific year,” McMahon says. He says existing carbon programs have more rigor and parameters. Some programs also nix payments to farmers who have installed previous conservation practices, he adds.

It remains to be determined what this payment plan has upon programs such as the Soil and Water Outcomes Fund, says Adam Kiel, SWOF managing director.

“Although some are saying that 45Z is locked in, we still don’t know if in-field climate-smart ag practices are eligible to count toward a fuel producer's score,” he says. “That decision is still with the U.S. Treasury Department.”

Hybrid program

Indigo Ag is already offering 45Z programs through several partnerships using interim guidance provided by USDA, says Chris Malone, vice president for Indigo Ag’s biofuels and market development.

NITROGEN MANAGEMENT: Payments also can be garnered for practices that optimize nitrogen management. (Tom J. Bechman)

“At Indigo Ag, we see 45Z as a complement to other sustainability programs, not a competitor,” he says.

Its FieldFlex program allows farmers to move eligible fields between 45Z and other programs as crop rotations and opportunities change, he says. This allows farmers flexibility to capture the best value from sustainability programs each year, Malone adds. It also allows agribusinesses and farmers the ability to monetize sustainability attributes, even if they can't take advantage of 45Z every year, he says.

Malone adds that Indigo Ag currently offers a guaranteed payment if Treasury does not implement 45Z.

No double dipping

Farmers cannot double dip payments between programs for which they are paid to slash greenhouse gas emissions in the same year, McMahon says.

However, he sees an opportunity for biodiversity payments — such as for improving water quality — to be stacked on top of payments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Farm bill components — such as the Regional Conservation Partnership Program — allow for this, McMahon says. So do inset programs such as SWOF and others, which pay farmers for improving water quality.

“You could stack a water-quality credit that pays farmers for reducing nitrate leaching on top of a Section 45Z payment for reducing nitrous oxide emissions,” he says.

Although this market is slower to develop than programs that slash greenhouse gases, interest exists, McMahon adds.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt6b1cec6ab39592f3/68824f90ffb8a05bb4b2f86d/0721F3-1623A-1800x1012-Recovered.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-25 12:56:41.060749

Payments shared between biofuel plants, farmers, grain merchandisers and others of $100 to $400 per acre have been batted around in recent years.
Still, it’s likely farmers will obtain something, says Monte Shaw, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association executive director.
“It’s going to be very expensive [for SAF] to break into the sustainable aviation market,” Shaw adds.
And if long-term projections for aviation industry de-carbonization hold, Shaw says SAF demand for corn ethanol could grow to a point where U.S. corn farmers — who currently grow about 15 billion bushels annually — would have difficulty meeting it.","So, how much money could farmers reap from Section 45Z tax credits gleaned by biofuel producers?

Payments shared between biofuel plants, farmers, grain merchandisers and others of $100 to $400 per acre have been batted around in recent years. Current legislation is silent about biofuel manufacturers sharing any money they garner from Section 45Z. Still, it’s likely farmers will obtain something, says Monte Shaw, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association executive director.

For example, say an ethanol plant lowers its carbon intensification (CI) score by 30 points via processing low-carbon corn and gleans 2 cents per CI point in tax credits. This tallies 60 cents per gallon, or $1.80 per bushel of corn, if the plant uses three bushels to make each gallon of ethanol.

“No one can sit here today and tell you what portion of that $1.80 [per bushel] will find its way back to the farmer,” Shaw says. “But I can say with a basis in history that we’ve never added $1.80 [per bushel] to the value of a commodity like corn where the farmer didn’t get some [additional value].”

Massive SAF market

Still, Shaw believes the most value from Section 45Z tax credits will come from using ethanol in the aviation industry’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“I think we’re missing the forest by seeing just the trees,” he says.

Over the last 40 years, average U.S. corn production has annually increased 210 million bushels, Shaw says. “That means that in 20 years, we will need a forest to chew up the [additional] 5 billion bushels of corn,” he adds.

Shaw thinks SAF could chew up this increase and more.

The airline currently accounts for 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050, says Meg Whitty, vice president of corporate affairs and marketing for LanzaJet, a sustainable fuels technology company. It’s estimated that SAF — a share of which comes from corn ethanol — could contribute about 65% of the emission reductions needed by the aviation industry to reach net-zero emissions by 2025, according to an analysis by the International Air Transport Association.

Growth potential is excellent, as SAF in 2024 represented only 340 million gallons out of a 100 billion-gallon jet fuel global market, Whitty says.

“The opportunity is massive,” she adds.

Facing hurdles

SAF fared poorly in current 45Z legislation, as Congress clipped its tax credit from a maximum of $1.75 to $1 per gallon.

“This is going to hinder the ability to turn ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel under the current version of 45Z,” says Mitchell Hora, a Washington, Iowa, farmer and founder and CEO of the software company Continuum Ag.

“It’s going to be very expensive [for SAF] to break into the sustainable aviation market,” Shaw adds. He says it will take the majority of the 45Z tax credit for SAF producers to document farm practices, increase plant operational efficiencies and replace natural gas — used in SAF manufacturing — with renewable natural gas.

ETHANOL OPPORTUNITY: New opportunities for ethanol produced in plants such as this Lincolnway Energy facility in Nevada, Iowa, could result from new markets. (Iowa Renewable Fuels Association)

However, hope exists. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, has moved to amend SAF’s tax treatment. And if long-term projections for aviation industry de-carbonization hold, Shaw says SAF demand for corn ethanol could grow to a point where U.S. corn farmers — who currently grow about 15 billion bushels annually — would have difficulty meeting it.

“When was the last time American famers had a market that wanted everything they could responsibly grow?” Shaw says. “I’m not saying that will happen, but that’s the potential size of this market.”

Politics

Still, biofuel growth is subject to political whims, says Owen Wagner, vice president of grains and an oilseeds analyst with Rabobank. “Fifteen to 20 years ago, when we were talking about grain markets, it would have been fundamentals,” he says. “Now, the growth and relative importance of biofuels requires a totally different way of analyzing markets.

“All this also has a strong political component in that it’s dictated by agricultural policy,” he adds. “We could have a future administration that shifts emphasis back to [vehicle] electrification rather than liquid fuels.”

If so, this could negatively alter the outlook for biofuels. “It all depends on what the energy priorities are coming out of D.C.,” Wagner says.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt98edeccfef4a13bb/68824a090a6c351ebcbc69a6/0721F2-1622A-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-25 11:56:26.393077

Efforts include cleaner energy, less flying, and remote work.

Formula 1 has made strong progress in cutting its carbon emissions, reaching a 26% drop by the end of 2024 compared to levels in 2018. It puts the sport more than halfway toward its goal of cutting emissions in half by 2030, with plans to offset any remaining emissions after that.

The progress was made possible through joint efforts between F1 teams, event promoters, partners, and the FIA. The changes come during a time of rapid growth for the sport, with the race calendar expanding from 21 events in 2018 to 24 in recent years. Attendance also jumped from 4 million to 6.5 million, and the global fan-base has grown to over 826 million.

According to the organisation’s latest sustainability update [PDF], if Formula 1 had not changed the way it operates, emissions would have risen by around 10% since 2018. Instead, they’ve gone down – with the 2024 carbon footprint measured at 168,720 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, down from 228,793 tonnes in 2018.

That 2018 figure was updated from a previous estimate to better reflect improved data from suppliers and align with international reporting standards. The update helps ensure that the reduction reflects actual improvements and not just changes in how emissions are counted.

Stefano Domenicali, President and CEO of Formula 1, said: “We are strongly committed to achieving Net Zero by 2030. It is a concrete goal, already visible in the significant reduction of our sport’s carbon footprint… We will continue to pursue our projects and next year we will introduce new actions, like the use of advanced sustainable fuels in all Formula 1 cars…”

Where the emissions cuts came from

Several key changes helped lower emissions in the sport:

Factories and offices: Emissions dropped by 59%, or over 34,000 tonnes, thanks to a switch to renewable energy at F1 team sites.

Travel: Emissions from air travel fell by about 20,000 tonnes, a 25% cut. The was made possible by using more remote broadcasting and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Freight and logistics: Emissions dropped by 6,438 tonnes, or 9%, by switching to newer freight containers, using more fuel-efficient planes, and running trucks on biofuels in Europe.

Race events: Emissions per race went down by 12%, as many venues began using solar power, biofuels, and greener energy sources. Total emissions for all races rose slightly due to the addition of more events.

Ellen Jones, Head of ESG at Formula 1, said: “All areas have been tasked with operating more sustainably, and it is through this sport-wide engagement and delivery that we are able to achieve such significant emissions reductions.” She added that upcoming changes to the race calendar starting in 2026 will further support this effort.

What’s next for Formula 1?

Formula 1 plans to keep investing in lower-carbon options, including:

Using more sustainable aviation fuel and expanding sea freight to cut air travel.

Creating regional hubs so equipment doesn’t need to travel as far.

Developing a 100% sustainable fuel that can also be used in regular cars, with full use expected by 2026.

Reducing the need to move large teams and gear by increasing remote production.

More than 80% of race promoters are now using some form of cleaner energy at events. Partners like Aggreko have also introduced lower-carbon systems using fuels like HVO, solar panels, and battery storage. These systems will be used at all European races from 2025.

Biofueled trucks now carry F1 equipment around Europe, cutting emissions by an average of 83%. The number of races held closer together by region has also gone up, cutting down on long-distance freight travel. In 2024, races in Japan, Singapore, and the Middle East were grouped more closely. From 2026, the Canadian Grand Prix will move to May and Monaco to June to better align with the European race season.

Other steps include:

All F2 and F3 cars now run on fully sustainable fuel, ahead of F1’s switch in 2026.

F1 medical and safety cars are already using a 40% sustainable fuel blend.

The tax credit’s worth is based on a carbon intensification (CI) score that tracks the biofuel supply chain’s carbon footprint. This includes greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane that can fuel climate change.

The fewer emissions used to produce a gallon of biofuel, such as ethanol or biodiesel, the more tax credits — and money — biofuel companies glean. Farmers play a part in reducing these emissions since the answer is literally under their feet. Soil health practices they implement — such as cover crops, reduced tillage and efficient fertilizer use — also can reduce or sequester greenhouse gas emissions.

Currently, nothing in Section 45Z states that biofuel producers must share the money from tax credits with anyone. Still, Hora thinks they will share it with farmers, grain merchandisers, third-party verifiers and others. He estimates tax credits potentially could be worth more than $100 per acre in sharable value.

“[Section 45 Z] could be absolutely game-changing for my family's farm and other family farms across the country,” he says. “I think it’s going to have a ripple effect that changes global agriculture.”

How so?

Voluntary programs that pay farmers to adopt practices to sequester or reduce greenhouse gases gained momentum in the late 2010s. One type — offset programs — pays farmers for soil health strategies to offset greenhouse gases emitted by companies making their products.

It’s not that simple, though. Some offset programs contain additionality clauses, which nix payment for prior practices farmers use to slash greenhouse gas emissions.

“If a producer switched from conventional tillage to no-till 20 years ago and picked up cover crops a decade ago, they're actually precluded from participating in a lot of these carbon markets,” says Sean McMahon, U.S. sustainability manager for FarmersEdge, a Canadian firm that provides agribusinesses and crop insurers technology services.

Others contain permanence clauses that pay farmers for greenhouse gas-reducing practices for a certain duration. A farmer who converted to greenhouse gas-sequestering no-till would void a contract if they switched to tillage, according to a University of Wisconsin Extension analysis.

“Some of these programs in a voluntary carbon [offset] market have a lot of red tape and hurdles,” Hora says.

That’s not so with potential Section 45Z payments. Unlike current carbon programs, there’s no contract to sign, nor are farmers who have installed prior greenhouse gas-sapping practices excluded.

Instead, potential payments are tied to the carbon footprint of each bushel a farmer grows, Hora says. The lower a farmer’s CI score, the higher the payments.

This appeals to Josh Nelson, who farms near Belmond, Iowa.

“This is an opportunity to pay farmers for practices they have been doing for a while,” he says. “Under [Section] 45Z, you could potentially get a payment for soil health practices that improve your CI score.”

All this ties into hungry global demand for low-carbon fuels, says Monte Shaw, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association executive director.

“Almost every major market that we see requires low-carbon ethanol,” he says. “The aviation industry wants it. Marine vessel fleets want it. The railroad industry wants locomotives that can generate electricity from low-carbon ethanol instead of diesel fuel.”

Biofuel win

Section 45Z was a winner in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed on July 4. Provisions include:

an extension of biofuel tax credits through 2029 (Initially, they were set to expire in 2027.)

a mandate that tax credits apply only to North American feedstocks such as corn and soybeans (It excludes foreign feedstocks, such as those used to make Chinese cooking oil.)

tax credit transferability (This allows biofuel producers to sell credits they can't directly use.)

ADDITIONAL REVENUE: Although corn prices are depressed due to a monster crop on the way, carbon intensification scoring under Section 45Z may unlock new revenue opportunities for farmers.

Congress also eliminated a part of the full life-cycle analysis within Section 45Z called indirect land use change (ILUC). This modeling method calculates how potential changes in economic demand for a crop affects global land use, says Karen Boyd, World Energy director of product sustainability. She says it’s important to remember that ILUC is just an economic model based on possible changes in future demand and cannot be directly measured or affected by an individual.

“If you grow soybeans, [45Z-induced production] may create additional demand for soybean oil due to it being utilized to produce fuel,” Boyd says.

ILUC modeling shows how this potential fuel use may impact land use for other soybean uses. It may mean land demand to grow soybeans for food and other purposes could come from areas such as a Brazilian rain forest converted into new farmland, she says.

CI scoring specifics

CI scoring works on a sliding scale for fuel, grain and oilseeds. Average CI scores include:

gasoline: 100

ethanol: 55

corn: 29.1

Biofuels companies could earn a 2-cent-per-CI-point reduction per gallon under the Section 45Z tax credit, Shaw says.

Nixing the ILUC alone will reduce the CI score for a typical Midwestern ethanol plant from 55 to 45, Shaw says. If combined with a 10-cent-per-gallon tax credit, an ethanol plant that annually produces 100 million gallons of ethanol could glean $10 million. Plants could use this money to pay farmers and others, upgrade capacity or make plant improvements.

“With these changes, I think the vast majority of ethanol plants are going to be able to qualify for the tax credits,” Shaw says.

Meanwhile, corn producers can lower their 29.1 CI score through various greenhouse gas-slashing practices. Nelson has lowered his CI score for corn to 5 by:

planting cover crops on a share of his acres

strip-tilling and no-tilling corn

implementing a three-crop rotation including corn, soybeans and small grains (oats/rye)

reducing nitrogen application to approximately 0.6 pounds per bushel for corn

applying hog manure as a nutrient source

improving fertilizer management using soil tests such as one for pre-sidedressed soil nitrate

Unknowns

Still, many unknowns exist, as Section 45Z now goes to the Treasury Department’s Internal Revenue Service to write regulations. The Treasury Department may consult with USDA and the Department of Energy, which were previously involved with Section 45Z provisions. Since it’s a tax issue, however, the Treasury Department has final say.

“Without final Treasury regulations, it’s difficult to predict exactly how farmers will benefit,” Shaw says.

Shaw believes the Treasury Department will create a pathway for farmers to receive individualized CI scores for low-carbon practices. Questions remain about what practices will be included and what model will be used to track these.

“USDA [under the Biden administration] didn’t recognize manure, and that’s one of the biggest [low-carbon] practices you can do,” Shaw says.

Monetization by farmers also remains uncertain. Much depends on how the Treasury Department tracks CI credits, Shaw says. The current draft uses mass balance, which links bushels and low-carbon credits for delivery to a biofuel producer.

“We have said from the beginning that mass balance is a mistake,” Shaw says. “It lumps corn [and other crops] together. Unless you’re selling directly to the plant, it is very limiting.”

The book-and-claim tracking system, which separates bushels and low-carbon credit certification, is better, Shaw says. It would enable farmers to separately sell their environmental attributes from their own CI scores from their grain and oilseed bushels.

CARBON SEQUESTRATION. Deep-rich soils hold the answer for sequestering greenhouse gases.

“If I'm 400 miles away from the nearest ethanol plant but can raise low-carbon corn, I could sell that credit to the ethanol plant,” Shaw says. “Book-and-claim would give every farmer a chance to participate and enlarge the ability to produce low-carbon ethanol.”

Other concerns

Extending the 45Z tax credit from 2027 to 2029 also was a win, Shaw says. Still, it dashed hopes for a 2031 extension. “This credit [through 2029] is not long enough for a plant to finance, build and operationalize major projects,” Shaw says.

Unless the credit is extended past 2029, biofuel plant managers will closely scrutinize and may pass on major investments, he adds.

ILEC also hasn’t gone away completely, Boyd says.

“It’s still part of other CI calculations that fuel producers’ value, such as California's [low-carbon fuel standard] or [Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation],” Boyd says. “Depending on the policy that is used to value the fuel, [ILUC] still is applicable.”

What to do

Hora hopes book-and-claim tracking will prevail. For now, though, he advises farmers, biofuel producers, grain merchandisers, elevators and other supply chain members to ready themselves for linked data and crop under mass balance tracking. This requires knowing the CI scores of the grain and verifying bushels at every point of aggregation.

“Every single step along the chain will undergo an audit,” Hora says.

If you want to know your CI score, Continuum Ag offers CI scoring. Iowa State University also offers a CI score calculator.

Knowing their CI score can help farmers decide which future low-carbon opportunities to pursue, says Eric Gibson, farm input and crop production sustainability analyst for Rabobank.

“You can only improve what you can measure,” he says.

Be careful. “Practices like cover crops are not inexpensive to implement,” says Tim Laatsch, North America director of agronomy for Koch Agronomic Services. “They carry some benefits, but they take time to materialize. They come with a learning curve, and some yield penalty if you aren't managing at a high level.”

Long term, however, Nelson sees the movement toward carbon intensification and low-carbon grains and oilseeds as a lasting trend. “You see Nestle, Unilever and European companies interested in paying farmers for their data to meet their [environmental, social and governance] goals,” he says. “Companies in Asia are also looking at their own ESG models. The idea of climate change or carbon removal is kind of off limits right now politically [in the U.S.], but I don't think it's going away globally.”

POTENTIAL BOOMING MARKET: Corn might be part of a future booming market due to its use in sustainable aviation fuel. However, reaching this market first will require leaping a few hurdles.

So, how much money could farmers reap from Section 45Z tax credits gleaned by biofuel producers?

Payments shared between biofuel plants, farmers, grain merchandisers and others of $100 to $400 per acre have been batted around in recent years. Current legislation is silent about biofuel manufacturers sharing any money they garner from Section 45Z. Still, it’s likely farmers will obtain something, says Monte Shaw, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association executive director.

For example, say an ethanol plant lowers its carbon intensification (CI) score by 30 points via processing low-carbon corn and gleans 2 cents per CI point in tax credits. This tallies 60 cents per gallon, or $1.80 per bushel of corn, if the plant uses three bushels to make each gallon of ethanol.

“No one can sit here today and tell you what portion of that $1.80 [per bushel] will find its way back to the farmer,” Shaw says. “But I can say with a basis in history that we’ve never added $1.80 [per bushel] to the value of a commodity like corn where the farmer didn’t get some [additional value].”

Massive SAF market

Still, Shaw believes the most value from Section 45Z tax credits will come from using ethanol in the aviation industry’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“I think we’re missing the forest by seeing just the trees,” he says.

Over the last 40 years, average U.S. corn production has annually increased 210 million bushels, Shaw says. “That means that in 20 years, we will need a forest to chew up the [additional] 5 billion bushels of corn,” he adds.

Shaw thinks SAF could chew up this increase and more.

The airline currently accounts for 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050, says Meg Whitty, vice president of corporate affairs and marketing for LanzaJet, a sustainable fuels technology company. It’s estimated that SAF — a share of which comes from corn ethanol — could contribute about 65% of the emission reductions needed by the aviation industry to reach net-zero emissions by 2025, according to an analysis by the International Air Transport Association.

Growth potential is excellent, as SAF in 2024 represented only 340 million gallons out of a 100 billion-gallon jet fuel global market, Whitty says.

“The opportunity is massive,” she adds.

Facing hurdles

SAF fared poorly in current 45Z legislation, as Congress clipped its tax credit from a maximum of $1.75 to $1 per gallon.

“This is going to hinder the ability to turn ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel under the current version of 45Z,” says Mitchell Hora, a Washington, Iowa, farmer and founder and CEO of the software company Continuum Ag.

“It’s going to be very expensive [for SAF] to break into the sustainable aviation market,” Shaw adds. He says it will take the majority of the 45Z tax credit for SAF producers to document farm practices, increase plant operational efficiencies and replace natural gas — used in SAF manufacturing — with renewable natural gas.

ETHANOL OPPORTUNITY: New opportunities for ethanol produced in plants such as this Lincolnway Energy facility in Nevada, Iowa, could result from new markets. (Iowa Renewable Fuels Association)

However, hope exists. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, has moved to amend SAF’s tax treatment. And if long-term projections for aviation industry de-carbonization hold, Shaw says SAF demand for corn ethanol could grow to a point where U.S. corn farmers — who currently grow about 15 billion bushels annually — would have difficulty meeting it.

“When was the last time American famers had a market that wanted everything they could responsibly grow?” Shaw says. “I’m not saying that will happen, but that’s the potential size of this market.”

Politics

Still, biofuel growth is subject to political whims, says Owen Wagner, vice president of grains and an oilseeds analyst with Rabobank. “Fifteen to 20 years ago, when we were talking about grain markets, it would have been fundamentals,” he says. “Now, the growth and relative importance of biofuels requires a totally different way of analyzing markets.

“All this also has a strong political component in that it’s dictated by agricultural policy,” he adds. “We could have a future administration that shifts emphasis back to [vehicle] electrification rather than liquid fuels.”

If so, this could negatively alter the outlook for biofuels. “It all depends on what the energy priorities are coming out of D.C.,” Wagner says.

SOIL-SMART PAYMENTS: These days, farmers can glean more payments for crops such as corn through payments for practices that sequester or slash greenhouse gases.

Ever wish you could be paid for the way you farm?

These days, you certainly can.

Payment for carbon and sequestering or squelching greenhouse gases to produce low-carbon fuels spurred by Section 45Z and accompanying tax credits may soon be reality. They join “offset” and “inset” programs that firms currently offer to farmers.

Offset programs pay farmers using practices such as cover crops that “offset” greenhouse gases that companies produce in manufacturing products. Inset programs occur when a firm works with its own supply chain or that of other companies to reduce a carbon footprint.

The Bayer Carbon Program has both inset and offset customers, says Alyssa Cho, Bayer sustainable agriculture field team lead. It pays farmers for sustainable practices they are already using on their own farm, such as reduced tillage or cover crops.

“We pay $6 per practice per year dating back to the fall of 2019,” Cho says. “We've also added a nitrogen-reduction offer that pays an additional $4 per acre.”

The Bayer Carbon Program contract is for five years. If a grower decides to sign up again at the end of the contract, Bayer offers another $6-per-acre bonus. Either Bayer or the farmer can exit the program before the contract expires.

Inset programs

The Soil and Water Outcomes Fund (SWOF) is an inset program that works with public and private organizations to achieve sustainability goals. It pays farmers who have implemented or expanded conservation to achieve environmental outcomes such as carbon sequestration, emission reductions and water-quality improvement.

It offers one-year contracts for practices such as:

reduced till and no-till

extended crop rotations

cover crops

Its average annual payout in 2024 was $33 per acre for participating farmers.

VARIETY OF PAYMENTS: Farmers can be paid for a variety of practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as reduced tillage or cover crops.

Carbon intensification scoring

What direction payments may take from Section 45Z federal tax credits hinges on regulations issued by the Treasury Department. It has not issued such regulations.

“The ethanol [biofuel] company is going to capture a lot of that value, perhaps the majority of it,” says Sean McMahon, head of U.S. sustainability for FarmersEdge. “But there's still substantial value there for farmers. There’s a premium for low-carbon grain, and that value is going to exceed carbon offsets or carbon insets based on the voluntary carbon market today.”

The tax credit’s worth is based on a carbon intensification (CI) score that tracks the biofuel supply chain’s carbon footprint. The more greenhouse gas-cutting practices a farmer adopts, the more he or she could potentially glean in payments from the tax credit passed on by the biofuel producer.

“What I love about CI scoring is it represents a snapshot of a particular crop in a particular field for a specific year,” McMahon says. He says existing carbon programs have more rigor and parameters. Some programs also nix payments to farmers who have installed previous conservation practices, he adds.

It remains to be determined what this payment plan has upon programs such as the Soil and Water Outcomes Fund, says Adam Kiel, SWOF managing director.

“Although some are saying that 45Z is locked in, we still don’t know if in-field climate-smart ag practices are eligible to count toward a fuel producer's score,” he says. “That decision is still with the U.S. Treasury Department.”

Hybrid program

Indigo Ag is already offering 45Z programs through several partnerships using interim guidance provided by USDA, says Chris Malone, vice president for Indigo Ag’s biofuels and market development.

NITROGEN MANAGEMENT: Payments also can be garnered for practices that optimize nitrogen management. (Tom J. Bechman)

“At Indigo Ag, we see 45Z as a complement to other sustainability programs, not a competitor,” he says.

Its FieldFlex program allows farmers to move eligible fields between 45Z and other programs as crop rotations and opportunities change, he says. This allows farmers flexibility to capture the best value from sustainability programs each year, Malone adds. It also allows agribusinesses and farmers the ability to monetize sustainability attributes, even if they can't take advantage of 45Z every year, he says.

Malone adds that Indigo Ag currently offers a guaranteed payment if Treasury does not implement 45Z.

No double dipping

Farmers cannot double dip payments between programs for which they are paid to slash greenhouse gas emissions in the same year, McMahon says.

However, he sees an opportunity for biodiversity payments — such as for improving water quality — to be stacked on top of payments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Farm bill components — such as the Regional Conservation Partnership Program — allow for this, McMahon says. So do inset programs such as SWOF and others, which pay farmers for improving water quality.

“You could stack a water-quality credit that pays farmers for reducing nitrate leaching on top of a Section 45Z payment for reducing nitrous oxide emissions,” he says.

Although this market is slower to develop than programs that slash greenhouse gases, interest exists, McMahon adds.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/bltf6c509b0025215bf/68824a0affb8a0266cb2f817/0721F1-1621A-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-25 09:56:13.115442

International Collaboration to Deliver NextGen-SAF

The project, titled NextGen-SAF, will be delivered by a consortium including:

Fuel Cell Energy (US)

Green Lizard Technologies (UK)

Drax Power (UK)

IMI Vivo (Italy)

Gardner Consulting (UK)

Leeds Bradford Airport (UK)

It has received letters of support from Airbus, Boeing, City of Doncaster Council, and Qatar Airways.

New Production Pathway: Power to Liquid (PtL)

Unlike traditional SAF production, which relies on bio or waste feedstocks, Sheffield’s technology removes this dependency. The new method, known as Power to Liquid (PtL), combines:

Renewable electricity to generate hydrogen

Carbon dioxide captured from the air or industrial processes

The hydrogen and CO₂ are then synthesised into hydrocarbons, which are refined into sustainable aviation fuel. This process not only decarbonises fuel production but could also support industrial applications.

Demonstration Plant to Combine World-First Technologies

The NextGen-SAF project will build a world-first demonstration plant integrating:

A Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) — to produce hydrogen and capture carbon dioxide

An Advanced Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor — to convert the gases into hydrocarbons

The goal is to showcase the system’s reliability and operability, proving its potential for large-scale SAF production.

A Major Step for UK’s Green Fuel Capabilities

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, said:

“We are proud to lead this project, made possible by this vital funding, to develop a new and innovative SAF production pathway.

Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to reducing emissions from the aviation industry, and through this project we are taking a major step toward scaling up SAF production right here in the UK.”

Government Backs Innovation and Green Jobs

During his announcement of £63 million in SAF project funding across 17 initiatives, Aviation Minister Mike Kane said:

“This £63 million is lift-off for Britain's green aviation revolution.

From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.”

Sheffield: A Global Leader in SAF Research

The University of Sheffield is recognised globally for its expertise in sustainable aviation fuel. Its Energy Innovation Centre houses advanced pilot-scale clean energy facilities, enabling research and collaboration between academics and industry.

The University also hosts the UK SAF Clearing House — one of only two centres worldwide — which helps fuel producers meet aviation certification standards.

From Transatlantic Flight to Emissions Reduction

Sheffield researchers were part of the consortium that achieved the world’s first transatlantic flight powered by sustainable aviation fuel. Using the University’s unique facilities, they analysed the impact of SAF on emissions and contrail formation, finding up to a 70% reduction in particulates.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is an alternative to fossil jet fuel. This alternative fuel reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 70% (average) in the lifecycle, which means from converting the feedstock to biofuel.

Additionally, this step will boost green fuel production in the United Kingdom. The SAF bill will promote the production of sustainable aviation fuel, attracting investors, which will help expand the sector. To date, the UK government has provided £198 million in funds through the AFF to broaden the adoption of cleaner aviation technologies.

The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, on which Sasol’s benchmark catalysts are based, was discovered and patented in 1925 by German chemical scientists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch. Since the 1950s, Sasol has developed the process as proprietary technology, making the company the world leader in this field. Proven over the last 30 years, Sasol’s Cobalt Fischer-Tropsch catalysts are currently the most reliable and effective of their kind.

(NASDAQ: LNZA) has received a £6.4 million grant from the UK government’s Advanced Fuels Fund to support two sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects aimed at reducing emissions from air travel. The announcement was made Tuesday via a company press release, reports Investing.com.

The grant will go toward LanzaTech’s DRAGON 1 and DRAGON 2 initiatives. DRAGON 1 will convert recycled carbon ethanol into SAF at a facility in Port Talbot, South Wales, using LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet technology. DRAGON 2, whose location in the UK is still being finalized, will convert waste carbon dioxide and green hydrogen into ethanol, which will then be used for SAF production.

LanzaTech’s CEO Dr. Jennifer Holmgren said the company is proud to lead innovation in aviation fuel, noting, “Ethanol-to-jet fuel isn’t just an idea—it’s happening, and it’s the way forward.”

The funding comes as LanzaTech continues to invest in commercialization. The company currently operates six commercial sites around the world but is still working toward profitability. According to InvestingPro, LanzaTech has been burning through cash quickly, making the UK government support a timely boost.

This investment is part of the UK’s broader £198 million plan to grow its SAF industry under the recently introduced SAF Mandate. The mandate aims to make cleaner aviation fuels a mainstream part of the country’s net-zero strategy.

In a separate development, LanzaJet’s Project Speedbird, in which LanzaTech owns a 36% stake, also received £10 million from the same government fund. Project Speedbird is focused on scaling up SAF production in the UK.

Meanwhile, in the U.S., LanzaTech has announced a workforce reduction at its headquarters in Skokie, Illinois, which will take effect by August 10, 2025. The move is part of a strategy to shift from a research-heavy model toward more commercial operations.

The company has also extended the maturity date of a loan tied to a Series A Convertible Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement to December 3, 2029. As part of the same agreement, it is extending deadlines for issuing warrants to purchase 780 million shares of common stock, pending shareholder approval.

LanzaTech’s integrated approach—combining its gas fermentation process with LanzaJet’s SAF production technology—continues to position the company as a key player in low-carbon fuel solutions, especially as governments and industries worldwide seek sustainable energy alternatives.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-1.png,N,,2025-07-25 09:56:59.900782

Earlier this year, Secretary Rollins issued a Secretarial Memorandum exempting National Security and Public Safety positions from the federal hiring freeze.

Washington, D.C. will still hold functions for every mission area of USDA at the conclusion of this reorganization, but USDA expects no more than 2,000 employees will remain in the NCR.
USDA will vacate and return to the General Services Administration the South Building, Braddock Place, and the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, and revisit utilization and functions in the USDA Whitten Building, Yates Building, and the National Agricultural Library.","U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins today announced the reorganization of the USDA, refocusing its core operations to better align with its founding mission of supporting American farming, ranching, and forestry.

Over the last four years, USDA’s workforce grew by 8%, and employees’ salaries increased by 14.5% - including hiring thousands of employees with no sustainable way to pay them. This all occurred without any tangible increase in service to USDA’s core constituencies across the agricultural sector. USDA’s footprint in the National Capital Region (NCR) is underutilized and redundant, plagued by rampant overspending and decades of mismanagement and costly deferred maintenance. President Trump has made it clear government needs to be scrutinized, and after this thorough review of USDA, the results show a bloated, expensive, and unsustainable organization.

To be clear, all critical functions of the Department will continue uninterrupted. For example, we are at the height of fire season, and to date, have not only exceeded hiring goals, but have preserved the ability to continue to hire. Earlier this year, Secretary Rollins issued a Secretarial Memorandum exempting National Security and Public Safety positions from the federal hiring freeze. These 52 position classifications carry out functions that are critical to the safety and security of the American people, our national forests, and the inspection and safety of the Nation’s agriculture and food supply system. These positions will not be eliminated. However, employees may be subject to relocation.

“American agriculture feeds, clothes, and fuels this nation and the world, and it is long past time the Department better serve the great and patriotic farmers, ranchers, and producers we are mandated to support. President Trump was elected to make real change in Washington, and we are doing just that by moving our key services outside the beltway and into great American cities across the country,” said Secretary Rollins. “We will do so through a transparent and common-sense process that preserves USDA’s critical health and public safety services the American public relies on. We will do right by the great American people who we serve and with respect to the thousands of hardworking USDA employees who so nobly serve their country.”

The reorganization consists of four pillars:

Ensure the size of USDA’s workforce aligns with available financial resources and agricultural priorities

Bring USDA closer to its customers

Eliminate management layers and bureaucracy

Consolidate redundant support functions

To bring USDA closer to the people it serves while also providing a more affordable cost of living for USDA employees, USDA has developed a phased plan to relocate much of its Agency headquarters and NCR staff out of the Washington, D.C. area to five hub locations. The Department currently has approximately 4,600 employees within the National Capital Region (NCR). This Region has one of the highest costs of living in the country, with a federal salary locality rate of 33.94%. In selecting its hub locations, USDA considered where existing concentrations of USDA employees are located and factored in the cost of living. Washington, D.C. will still hold functions for every mission area of USDA at the conclusion of this reorganization, but USDA expects no more than 2,000 employees will remain in the NCR.

USDA will vacate and return to the General Services Administration the South Building, Braddock Place, and the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, and revisit utilization and functions in the USDA Whitten Building, Yates Building, and the National Agricultural Library. The George Washington Carver Center will also be utilized until space optimization activities are completed. These buildings have a backlog of costly deferred maintenance and currently are occupied below the minimum set by law. For example, the South Building has approximately $1.3 billion in deferred maintenance and has an average daily occupancy of less than 1,900 individuals for a building that can house over 6,000 employees.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/USDA_July25_ab31c1341a.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 00:56:12.881972

The company is gaining media attention with its D328eco aircraft, a new-generation turboprop designed for fuel efficiency and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) capability. Beyond sustainability, the aircraft targets a strategic niche, namely replacing aging regional turboprop fleets and addressing connectivity gaps between smaller cities and major hubs.

According to Eurostat data extracted in June 2025, intra-EU and domestic transport shares in 2024 were 36.3% and 14.3%, respectively. This underscores the ongoing demand for regional turboprop connectivity – a market that Deutsche Aircraft intends to tap with the D328eco and its future models.

At the Paris Air Show 2025, AeroTime sat down with Deutsche Aircraft CEO Nico Neumann to discuss the German manufacturer’s plans to make an impact on the regional aviation market.

What sets D328eco apart

Neumann explained that the D328eco turboprop builds upon the original Dornier 328 design, incorporating significant upgrades. The fuselage has been extended by 2.1 meters to accommodate 40 passengers, up from 33 in the original model. It is powered by a new Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127XT engine and features the latest Garmin G5000 avionics suite. Neumann noted that these modifications make the aircraft “unique”.

The decision to develop the D328eco with 40-seat capacity was chosen based on market research targeting the replacement of aging 30- to 36-seat aircraft, aligning with current demand.

“No one wants to downsize when replacing an aircraft, but we also looked at how we don’t get too big that we are in competition,” Neumann said. “To serve that market, using 40 seats was the ideal solution.”

Neumann noted that some markets are more suitable for the aircraft. He said that while he wouldn’t limit its use to any specific area, the D328eco is especially well-suited for places with underdeveloped infrastructure, such as northern Canada, Australia, and some parts of Africa.

“We have a global team and 46 nationalities on board. We have a global supply chain, and we like to deliver a global product, so we are not limited to any market,” he said.

Three market pillars behind D328eco

Neumann pointed out that, to his knowledge, there is currently no other turboprop program being developed specifically for the regional turboprop market targeting 40-seat aircraft, making this market niche unique at present.

He categorized the industry into three main pillars. The first pillar is the replacement market. Neumann noted that many older aircraft in this category, such as the Saab 340 and Dornier 328, are now over 30 years old and are in need of replacement.

He highlighted that the D328eco distinguishes itself from these older models by being more cost-efficient, offering better fuel efficiency, providing greater passenger comfort, and ensuring higher operational flexibility.

The second pillar focuses on the growth market, with India being a key example. With ongoing airport expansions in India, there is a demand for aircraft that can connect smaller airports to major hubs. Neumann suggested that the D328eco’s size and capabilities make it a “perfect fit” for this purpose.

The third pillar is influenced by current geopolitical demands and involves multi-mission applications, such as search and rescue, border control, troop transport, and paratrooper deployment. The company is actively developing solutions to meet the needs of this segment as well.

How practical is SAF in turboprop aviation?

According to Neumann, once the D328eco receives certification, it will be allowed to run on anything from 100% standard kerosene to 100% SAF. This indicates that various fuel mixtures are feasible – for instance, the aircraft could be operated with 50% or 70% SAF.

However, sustainability wasn’t the sole factor for the German turboprop manufacturer in selecting the D328eco for development. Neumann explained that the aircraft is primarily designed to be economical, consuming less fuel, which is cost-effective and environmentally friendly.

“The first target of our engineers is always to reduce the fuel flow, to get it as efficient as possible, and then combine it with new technologies which are available on the fuel side,” he said.

Neumann also pointed out that the necessary infrastructure and industrial capacity to generate sufficient SAF have not yet been established. However, the company is considering future fuel options that will be significant in the next 50 years.

“I believe that, as an industry, we view SAF as the most promising solution based on power-to-liquid processes without aromatics, which will have the greatest positive impact on the climate while balancing cost efficiency with practicality,” he said.

Countdown to certification and airline entry

In discussing the major milestones leading up to the D328eco’s readiness for airline operations, Neumann highlighted several parallel steps in the process.

On May 28, 2025, Deutsche Aircraft unveiled the test prototype of the D328eco, known as ‘TAC1’. Neumann stated that preparations for ground testing are currently underway as the company prepares to launch its flight test campaign, scheduled for 2026.

A second test aircraft is expected to join the program that year, and Neumann mentioned that a third aircraft may also be included. He noted that the third aircraft will be produced on the final assembly line by the end of 2025.

Starting in 2026, the company aims to begin production of the first aircraft from that line, which will serve as the third test aircraft. This aircraft will participate in the flight test campaign, with the objective of achieving certification in 2027 and entering service by the end of that year, at which point airlines will start receiving it.

Laying the groundwork for future aircraft

Neumann mentioned that many customers and operators engaged with Deutsche Aircraft at the Paris Air Show. He added that the manufacturer “received very good feedback” and its order book is “filling up quite positively”.

In concluding the interview, he emphasized that the company does not intend to become a single-product Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).

“As a normal business, we look at the future. We are building up a lot of skills and competences, and it would be a shame to lose them after one product,” he said. “I have a small team working on the concept of our next aircraft.”",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/07/Deutsche-Aircraft-CEO-Nico-Neumann-2-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 00:56:17.088216

Additionally, it supports the SAF mandate introduced in January 2025, which requires aviation fuel suppliers to blend increasing amounts of SAF into the total aviation mix.","The UK government has provided £63 million investment to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and support 1,400 jobs in the UK.

The investment will be awarded to 17 UK companies developing SAF, and the government states that this will help position the UK as “the world leader in homegrown SAF production”.

Globally, production has failed to ramp up sufficiently, with SAF sometimes transported from its place of production to where it is then used. IATA’s director-general Willie Walsh was quoted by Reuters as saying: “The idea that you’re buying sustainable fuel and then transporting it to use in Europe isn’t the right way to do it because you’re clearly increasing the carbon footprint of that fuel as a result of the transportation costs.”

The new investment by the UK government is also linked to the recent government “greenlighting of multiple airport expansion schemes to kickstart economic growth” as part of its Plan for Change.

The companies are part of the Advanced Fuel Fund (AFF) competition which provides grant funding to first-of-a-kind commercial and demonstration-scale projects in the UK at development stages up to construction starting.

The AFF winners include a range of companies spread across the country including OXCCU Tech, which is developing a demonstration plant at Oxford Airport, as well as LanzaJet, which is building a commercial-scale plant in Teesside.

The investment means that the government has provided £198 million to date through the AFF to scale up cleaner aviation technologies. The government says that low carbon fuel production could contribute £5 billion to the economy by 2050, positioning the UK as a global hub for SAF production and enabling it to go further and faster with expansion plans.

The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) and International Air Transport Association (IATA) have both been clear about the need to quickly expand SAF production, as previously reported by Business Traveller.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, commented:

“This £63 million is lift off for Britain’s green aviation revolution. We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.”

The government has introduced a SAF bill which provides the legal framework for a ‘revenue certainty mechanism’ to support the production of SAF in the UK. This helps to reduce the uncertainty around production and encourage the development and deployment of SAF.

Additionally, it supports the SAF mandate introduced in January 2025, which requires aviation fuel suppliers to blend increasing amounts of SAF into the total aviation mix. The mandate started at 2% this year, rising to 10% in 2030.

The announcement of the new funding was made at the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre – which received £1.5 million as part of the programme.

Professor Mohamed Pourkashanian, managing director of the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre, who is leading the project, said:

“It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions. At Sheffield, we have some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe and are excited to work with partners from the industry to help them test and develop new fuels and next generation clean energy technologies.”

Andrew Symes, CEO and co-founder of OXCCU, said:

“Support from the Advanced Fuels Fund is a key step in scaling our technology. This funding enables the detailed design and construction of OX2, our demonstration plant launching in 2026, and builds on the successful delivery of OX1. It brings us closer to producing lower-cost, lower-carbon aviation fuel and supports the UK’s ambition to become a global leader in SAF production.”

For the full year 2025, Neste currently expects renewable sales volumes to be up when compared to 2024.","Neste Corp. on July 24 released second quarter results, reporting record quarterly renewable product sales volumes despite weaker margins. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sales were up nearly 80% when compared to the first quarter of 2025.

Comparable EBITDA for the renewables segment was EUR 174 million, up from EUR 152 million during the second quarter of last year. Heikki Malinen, president and CEO of Neste, attributed the increase to higher sales volumes, partially offset by weaker margins.

The comparable sales margin for renewables was $361 per ton, down from $382 per ton, while sales volumes set a new quarterly record at 1.096 million metric tons, up from 955,000 metric tons during the second quarter of last year, Malinen said.

Approximately 73% of renewables volumes were sold to the European market, with 27% sold to North America. During the second quarter of 2024, 49% of renewables volumes were sold to Europe and 51% were sold to North America.

SAF sales were up nearly 80%, supported by increased production capacity at Neste’s refinery in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Due to renewable diesel reference prices climbing in Europe towards the end of the second quarter, Neste said more capacity was directed to serve this market.

Neste produced approximately 844,000 metric tons of renewable diesel during the second quarter, down from 858,000 metric tons during the same period of last year.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sales were up nearly 80% when compared to the first quarter of 2025.

Comparable EBITDA for the renewables segment was EUR 174 million, up from EUR 152 million during the second quarter of last year. Heikki Malinen, president and CEO of Neste, attributed the increase to higher sales volumes, partially offset by weaker margins.

The comparable sales margin for renewables was $361 per ton, down from $382 per ton, while sales volumes set a new quarterly record at 1.096 million metric tons, up from 955,000 metric tons during the second quarter of last year, Malinen said.

Approximately 73% of renewables volumes were sold to the European market, with 27% sold to North America. During the second quarter of 2024, 49% of renewables volumes were sold to Europe and 51% were sold to North America.

SAF sales were up nearly 80%, supported by increased production capacity at Neste’s refinery in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Due to renewable diesel reference prices climbing in Europe towards the end of the second quarter, Neste said more capacity was directed to serve this market.

Neste produced approximately 844,000 metric tons of renewable diesel during the second quarter, down from 858,000 metric tons during the same period of last year.

DGD in 2024 completed a project to add SAF capacity to its Port Arthur plant in Texas. The SAF project, which gives the plant optionality to upgrade approximately 50% of its current 470 MMgy production capacity to SAF, was fully operational by January 2025.

During a second quarter earnings call, Eric Fischer, senior vice president of product supply, trading and wholesale at Valero, confirmed that the SAF project operates well. He also noted that “the logistics and blendability have been a positive” and that “the ability to move [SAF] through the Valero jet fuel system has been very effective.” The one downward surprise cited by Fischer is lower than expected market interest in SAF, particularly from airlines. “I think everyone is still feeling out this market,” he said, noting that the company could see sales pick up during the second half of the year due to demand created by European SAF mandates.

In a world shaped by multiple overlapping crises, the question we must ask ourselves is: How do we create energy security and resilience through energy and fuel diversification?

The new energy reality calls for diversification

Supply disruptions, price volatility and geopolitical uncertainty are some of the critical issues the energy sector faces globally. At the same time, energy demand is set to grow significantly. There’s no quick fix or one-size-fits-all solution, but one mitigation approach is essential: fuel and energy diversification.

When energy systems depend on limited sources or suppliers, they become highly vulnerable to shocks and disruptions. Extreme weather events and geopolitical conflicts can cut off supply suddenly and send prices soaring - something the world has already experienced.

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Europe reduced its dependency on Russian gas – cutting the share of the EU’s total energy imports from 40 percent in 2021 to 10 percent in 2024 (IEA WEO 2024). Turning to the US for imports, an outage at a single LNG terminal in Texas drove EU wholesale gas prices up more than 10 percent in 2022 (IEA WEO 2023).

Dependencies can quickly turn into vulnerabilities. The global energy crisis has shown us how fast that can happen. While some of the immediate effects began to recede in 2023, significant risk of disruption remains.

A diverse mix of energy and fuel sources and suppliers is vital for:

Security & price stability. Concentration of energy sources exposes economies to supply shocks and price swings.

Geopolitical risk mitigation. Relying on a few geographies for imports creates exposure to geopolitical risks and potential supply chain disruptions. Spreading imports across regions and investing in localized production strengthens resilience.

Climate resilience. Extreme weather threatens single-source systems. Diversified, distributed generation is inherently more robust (UNDP). IEA partly credits extreme weather for the notably faster growth-rate of energy demand in 2024.

Affordability. Over-reliance on one fuel or supplier reduces competition and amplifies price risk.

Bottom line: A diversified portfolio of energy and fuel sources, technologies and suppliers is an insurance policy in an uncertain world.

Solutions to diversify and strengthen global energy and fuel systems

Today’s global energy mix remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Oil, coal and natural gas still make up around 80% of energy consumption (IEA WEO 2024). Renewable energy sources, like solar, wind, hydropower and biomass, are growing but not fast enough to offset the rising demand for energy.

Looking at the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario, the energy landscape is radically different in 2050. Clean energy meets 90 percent of global energy demand, around one-third of the remaining fossil fuel demand is fully abated, around half is used as a feedstock or in other non-energy use, and the remainder is offset by direct air capture, negative emissions from bioenergy, or other forms of carbon removal technologies.

This paves the way for a system that is more sustainable, resilient and secure – and the solutions to diversify are already available and proven:

E-fuels, such as e-methanol, green ammonia and sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF), offer alternative fuel solutions and can lower emissions for energy-intensive industries like aviation and shipping in existing infrastructure.

Renewable fuels, produced from feedstocks such as waste oils, enable emissions reductions through drop-in replacements for diesel and jet fuel.

Low-carbon fuels, such as low-carbon hydrogen and low-carbon ammonia – also known as blue hydrogen and blue ammonia - are essential transition solutions, leveraging carbon capture to reduce emissions from conventional fuel production. These aren’t just alternatives; they are viable, scalable pathways to a secure, future-ready energy mix.

But deployment is lagging. Policy uncertainty and limited access to financing are holding back progress. Despite global ambition, growth is not yet on track. Accelerating the shift will require aligning technology, policy and investment at scale.

Long-term strategies for diversifying energy sources and building resilience

Long-term strategies for diversifying energy sources and building resilience

To build a resilient and secure energy future, diversification must be embedded in long-term national and regional strategies. This means not only increasing the supply of clean power and fuels but also ensuring that energy systems can withstand shocks – from market disruptions to extreme weather. With energy demand projected to grow up to 18 percent by 2050 (McKinsey), the need for infrastructure that is scalable and sustainable is clear.

Just like a solid investment strategy, diversification is about spreading risk. That means:

Fuel variety, from different feedstock such as renewable electricity and sustainable biomass, and different fuels such as e-fuels, renewable fuels and transitional fuels with carbon capture.

Geographic diversity, through domestic generation of renewable electricity, localized fuel production and diversified import routes.

Technological breadth, including wind, solar, electrolyzers, energy storage, carbon removal technology and more.

Supply chain resilience, achieved through dual sourcing, localized production and circular materials.

However, closing the gap between today and tomorrow’s energy system will require coordinated action across government, industry and financiers. It requires robust, long-term policy to create demand certainty and lower capital risk, and it requires massive investment - estimated at ~$150 trillion by 2050 (IRENA).

Topsoe's role in energy diversification

We’re taking part in shaping a low-carbon economy through partnerships and projects that expand and diversify the fuel landscape.

By developing technologies and solutions to produce a diverse range of fuels – from e-fuels to renewable fuels to low-carbon fuels - we take a leading role in the transition toward a more resilient fuel mix.

Our collaboration with Montana Renewables is one of our many projects producing low-carbon fuels globally. Montana Renewables is leading North America’s SAF industry using our HydroFlex™ technology to produce 30 million gallons per year - with plans to scale up to 300 MGY.

We’re helping scale high-efficiency electrolysis with our SOEC manufacturing facility in Herning, Denmark, while our supply chain partnerships help localize critical clean-tech production.

We’re providing technology and engineering support for producing e-methanol for shipping and chemical industries at commercial scale in Spain. Foresta del Atlántico’s Triskelion project is expected in 2027 to start production with annual capacity of 40,000 tons of e-methanol, also known as green methanol, while capturing and using c. 56,000 tons of CO2.

Together with our partner Sasol we’ll provide G2L™ e-fuels technology for the initial built-up of the German Aerospace Center’s Technology Platform Power-to-Liquid Fuels at the Leuna Chemical Complex in Germany. It’s expected to be commissioned in late 2027 and to produce 2500 tons of e-fuels per year, mainly e-SAF, for research purposes. With €130 million of funding secured from the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV), the plant will be the largest facility for production of e-fuels for research.

We’re helping fuel Brazil’s first commercial-scale SAF plant through our HydroFlex™ and H2bridge™ technologies. Refinaria Riograndense is expected to be operational in the first half of 2028 and aims to produce 16,000 barrels of renewable diesel and SAF per day.

These initiatives are not only diversifying energy sources, they’re helping redefine what resilience means in the energy sector.

The New Terminal One at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport has successfully closed a $1.367 billion Green Bond issuance, reflecting strong investor confidence in the project. Proceeds from the Series 2025 Bonds will be used to fund the remainder of Phase A construction, with the terminal set to open in 2026.

This follows the terminal’s record-setting $2.55 billion Green Bond issuance in 2024, the largest municipal bond financing ever for an airport project. Together, these financings support the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey’s $19 billion redevelopment of JFK Airport, which includes two new terminals, modernised facilities, a new ground transportation centre and an improved road network.

“The success of our green bond issuance reaffirms investor confidence in the New Terminal One and further strengthens our foundation for innovation and delivery as we progress towards our 2026 opening,” said Jennifer Aument, Chief Executive Officer of The New Terminal One. “We are grateful for the support of our valued investors and the dedication of our financial sponsors. Together, we are building a terminal that will set new global standards for excellence and environmental stewardship.”

Despite a competitive market, investors submitted nearly $4.3 billion in orders for the Series 2025 Bonds. This demand allowed for a repricing of the bonds, reducing overall borrowing costs.

“In a highly competitive market, the strength of investor demand allowed us to tighten pricing and optimize our cost of capital, a testament to both the quality of this project and the disciplined financial strategy we’ve maintained since inception,” said Manoj Patel, Chief Financial Officer of The New Terminal One.

The New York Transportation Development Corporation acted as the conduit issuer on behalf of the terminal. Kestrel Verifiers designated the bonds as Green Bonds for meeting high sustainability criteria, while Assured Guaranty provided insurance on $600 million of the issue.

From cutting deadly air pollution near airports to boosting long-term decarbonization, two complementary policy tools offer a clear path forward for cleaner skies.

Addressing climate and air pollution from global aviation has never been more urgent. If aviation were a country, it would be one of the world’s top 10 sources of climate pollution – and demand for air travel is growing. Fortunately, two strategies – one focused on strengthening international aviation’s carbon price signal and broadening its scope, and the other on cleaning up jet fuel itself – offer powerful, complementary paths forward.

Smarter jet fuel policies and carbon markets can power cleaner aviation Share on X

The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation and targeted jet fuel regulation can work hand-in-hand to deliver near-term air quality improvements while driving long-term climate progress. With smart policy design, both approaches could be game changers.

This is the thesis of two EDF articles published last month in the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Environment Report, an agenda-setting publication that’s only issued every three years by the ICAO Secretariat. It’s an opportunity for aviation industry, advocates and other stakeholders to showcase the most pressing environmental issues.Below is a summary of EDF’s articles, but if you’d like to dive deeper you can read the full versions here and here.

CORSIA: A global framework that needs integrity to deliver

CORSIA, established by ICAO in 2016, is the world’s first sector-specific global carbon offset program. It caps emissions from international flights and requires participating airlines to offset any growth above 2019 levels using either high-quality carbon credits or low-carbon jet fuels certified as “CORSIA Eligible Fuels.”

As it enters its first operational phase (2024–2026), CORSIA has the potential to prevent up to 1.5 billion tons of CO₂ emissions by 2035. But to fulfill this promise, its integrity must be safeguarded. That means ensuring that every offset credit and alternative fuel delivers genuine, verifiable climate benefits — and that emissions aren’t “double counted” by both airlines and national governments under the Paris Agreement.

The risks of weak rules are real. If the market is flooded with low-integrity offsets or if sustainable aviation fuel claims are made without proper tracking, the environmental value of CORSIA could be undermined. Improved monitoring, reporting, and verification systems, coupled with formal government attestations to avoid double claiming of eligible fuels, could significantly enhance transparency and trust in the system.

Crucially, CORSIA must evolve beyond its current carbon-only focus. Non-CO2 effects from aviation — including contrail-induced global warming — are significant and require policy attention. Non-CO2 effects could be as great, or even twice as great, as those from CO2 alone when expressed in terms of effective radiative forcing. In the long term, CORSIA should help create meaningful price signals for the full range of aviation climate impacts, incentivizing innovation across aircraft design, operations and sustainable fuel production.

Jet fuel regulation: An immediate opportunity for health and climate

While CORSIA lays the groundwork for long-term decarbonization, a separate opportunity could deliver big wins today: regulating the aromatic and sulfur content of jet fuel.

Current jet fuels contain up to 25% aromatic hydrocarbons and significant levels of sulfur. These ingredients generate fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during combustion — pollution that not only has an indirect net warming effect, but also poses serious risks to public health, including respiratory and cardiovascular problems, and even premature death. A recent EDF study found that between 5.8 million and 16 million Americans are at risk for exposure to PM 2.5 from aviation in the vicinity of airports.

Evidence shows that reducing aromatic and sulfur content in jet fuel can significantly cut PM2.5 emissions. In blended fuels with a high share of synthetic, sulfur-free components, reductions of 50–70% in particulate emissions under certain conditions. These gains are especially pronounced during takeoff, taxiing and landing — around airports.

Public health experts are increasingly concerned about aviation-attributable PM2.5. Globally, these emissions are linked to more than 21,000 premature deaths each year. A recent reevaluation of earlier studies suggests aviation’s overall air quality impacts may be substantially greater than previously estimated. And in countries with heavy air traffic, like China, the annual toll from aviation-related PM pollution could be as high as 67,000 lives.

Cleaner fuels mean less PM 2.5, fewer contrails and a smaller overall climate footprint.

The policy path is clear: ICAO could establish international standards limiting aromatic and sulfur levels in jet fuel to levels compatible with existing safety and performance standards, much as countries already regulate diesel fuel for ground transportation. While most road diesel is now “ultra-low sulfur,” aviation fuel remains largely unregulated on these dimensions. ICAO is uniquely positioned to harmonize standards globally and maximize reductions.

And the economic case is strong. Cleaner jet fuel could raise fuel costs by just 2% or less — a marginal increase that equates to less than half a percent of operating costs for airlines. Moreover, cleaner fuels offer higher energy density, which could improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions further.

A call-to-action

The window for action is now. Global aviation emissions are rising, and the decisions made in the next few years will shape the sector’s impact for decades. Smart, targeted investments in policy design, regulatory development, and high-integrity market infrastructure can help bend the curve toward cleaner skies.

Together, these steps can reduce pollution, protect lives and bring the aviation sector closer to its long-overdue climate course correction.

Funding will be crucial in supporting the green fuels and technologies of the future, so the UK can clean up its sea travel and trade.

Awarded from the sixth round of the Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition (CMDC), successful companies will be given a share of funding to support the development of clean maritime fuels and technologies such as ammonia, hydrogen, methanol, solar and electric.

Boosting economic growth with green fuels and technologies

Investment in green fuels not only supports the decarbonisation of shipping, helping cement the UK as a clean energy superpower, it also revitalises coastal communities by growing local economies and boosting jobs and skills.

CMDC has provided over £136m funding to date to 142 organisations, as part of the wider UK SHORE funding – the government’s flagship programme dedicated to decarbonising maritime – for over 300 organisations, including 250 SMEs.

Successful projects include the installation of electric chargepoint networks across ports, including at Aberdeen, the demonstration of an electric crew transfer vessel at Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm, and the demonstration of a green hydrogen shore power system at the port of Leith.

Maritime Minister Mike Kane said: “It’s so exciting to see investment in green fuels and technologies spurring on skills, innovation and manufacturing across the UK, delivering on Plan for Change missions to kickstart economic growth and become a clean energy superpower.”

High-tech innovations from industry

Minister Kane will meet with workers from the National Manufacturing Institute Scotland during his visit to Clydeport. The National Manufacturing Institute is looking to help Smart Green Shipping scale up the manufacturing of the FastRig windsail.

Built nearby in Glasgow, the FastRig is a high-tech wing sail which can be installed onto vessels, reducing fuel use and emissions by up to 40% per annum. The project received £3.3m from the third round of the CMDC and has now been successfully deployed at sea.

“Clean maritime is a vital part of a wider mission to decarbonise transport. Advanced manufacturing is critical to enable companies to scale up novel solutions that deliver emissions reductions and allow the creation of new jobs in these industries of the future,” stated Chris Courtney, CEO of the National Manufacturing Institute.

Advancing expertise in shipbuilding and manufacturing

During the Clydeport visit, the minister will meet with Peel Ports and local workers at Clydeport’s King George V Docks.

By delivering £3m of investment to support the growing demand for handling huge wind turbine components for the renewable energy sector, Clydeport is keeping Glasgow’s shipbuilding heritage and manufacturing expertise alive, equipping it to meet the modern-day needs of the sector.

“Our recent investment in road infrastructure at King George V Dock to accommodate growing demand for handling wind turbine components, and our ongoing transformative work at Hunterston PARC in Ayrshire to support the renewables sector, demonstrate our commitment to decarbonising supply chains and enabling the transition to a greener economy,” commented Jim McSporran, Port Director at Peel Ports Clydeport.

Research hub for clean maritime operations

Building on its commitment to clean up shipping and deliver on the UK’s climate ambitions, the UK is also delivering £3.85m to the Clean Maritime Research Hub.

Formed from a consortium of 13 universities across the UK, dedicated to conducting scientific research in clean maritime, the funding will enable the hub to continue its important research, and support the installation of a liquid hydrogen facility at Durham University.

Most notably, it extended the credit through 2029, providing biofuels producers with an additional two years of investment beyond the original 2027 expiration date. While the credit still has no requirements to pass through any of the credit to farmers and feedstock producers, the OBBBA clarified key provisions related to feedstock eligibility, emissions measurement and credit calculation, which are especially relevant for U.S. farmers. This Market Intel analyzes what the changes to 45Z mean for farmers.

The Evolution of 45Z

The 45Z credit was established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 to encourage domestic production of low-emission fuels. It is not tied to a specific type of fuel or production technology; it instead bases eligibility solely on a fuel’s ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional petroleum-based fuels. This credit was created to consolidate separate tax credits for biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The 45Z credit applies to fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2024, and was originally set to expire at the end of 2027. The OBBBA extended the credit to fuel sold by Dec. 31, 2029.

The 45Z tax credit is dependent on how much the eligible fuel reduces emissions and is claimed by biofuel producers. The emissions from feedstock production through fuel combustion is estimated using the U.S. Department of Energy 45ZCF-GREET (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies) Model. The GREET model consolidates all of the greenhouse gas emissions of each step of the biofuels supply chain, dependent on things like form of transportation and farming practices, into a specific emission rate for a gallon of fuel. This emission rate becomes your carbon intensity (CI) score; the lower the CI score, the higher the tax credit. To qualify, fuels must produce less than 50 kilograms of carbon dioxide per unit of energy – half of traditional petroleum products – for a base credit of 20 cents per gallon. The fuels that reduce emissions the most can earn biofuel producers up to $1 per gallon in 45Z tax credits.

GREET scores can be lowered in various ways, including on how the feedstock was produced. For example, the standard CI score for corn is 29.1. This means traditionally produced corn as a feedstock would largely not reduce emissions enough to qualify for 45Z credits. However, by utilizing conservation methods like no-till, cover cropping or high-efficiency fertilizers that affect carbon sequestration and release from soils, you can lower the CI score. While the GREET model was updated in January 2025, the OBBBA now requires the model to be adjusted again to exclude emissions from indirect land use change (ILUC)– the conversion of grassland, forestland, etc. to cropland to produce biofuels feedstock.

OBBBA also clarified that, to qualify for the 45Z credit, eligible fuels must be produced by American-controlled firms using feedstocks sourced from North America (the United States, Mexico or Canada). This change supports a broad range of agricultural feedstocks, including corn, soybeans and other biomass-based materials, expanding market opportunities for farmers while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The amendment was designed to prevent large imports of used cooking oil (UCO), which had more favorable carbon intensity scores as it is considered a waste product with minimal lifecycle emissions. There was also increasing scrutiny over the possibility of fraud in imported feedstocks, as some UCO may be blended with virgin oils and falsely labeled as waste to qualify for higher credits.

The OBBBA also amended 45Z and Section 6426(k) to ensure that sustainable aviation fuel producers do not receive overlapping credits and removed premiums in the credit for SAF. Before passage of OBBBA, SAF could receive an extra 75 cents per unit of carbon reduced compared to other clean fuels. Lastly, the legislation increased credits for small producers to encourage blending capacity increase.

Effect on Markets

Many anticipate that the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, especially with changes made under the OBBBA, will increase demand for domestically sourced feedstocks. While the 45Z tax credit is awarded to fuel producers, not directly to farmers, it incentivizes fuel producers to increase production of eligible fuels and thus purchase additional feedstocks, creating the potential for more stable demand and stronger prices for key commodities tied to eligible fuel production.

Renewable fuels are already a major source of demand for U.S. agriculture, particularly for corn and soybeans. USDA projects that 35% of U.S. corn production will be used for ethanol in 2025. Additionally, corn oil can be used in biodiesel production. At the same time, more than 50% of domestically produced soybean oil is expected to go into biofuels, including biodiesel and renewable diesel.

45Z Challenges

With the changes to 45Z in the OBBBA, the Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) must now rewrite the regulations and guidance for qualifying fuels. This also requires USDA to finalize (or change) the interim technical guideline for “climate-smart” practices that lower CI scores for biofuels feedstocks. USDA has largely turned away from labeling conservation practices as “climate-smart.” In January, the Office of the Chief Economist at USDA released a list of 24 possible conservation practices or combinations of practices that could lower GREET scores for biofuels. Notably, they removed the previous requirements for 40B SAF tax credits that required farmers to conduct “bundles”, set combinations, of conservation practices, which added to the complexity of qualifying for biofuels credits and vastly limiting the eligible feedstocks. However, there is still time for the USDA to alter the eligible emissions-reducing practices.

It is also important to reiterate that there is no requirement for biofuels producers to pass any of their earnings from 45Z on to the farmers who produced their feedstocks. With rising global row crop production and low-profit margins creating uncertain market conditions for farmers, additional premiums from eligible biofuel feedstock sales can make or break farm balance sheets. However, the conservation practices required to sell crops as feedstock require significant upfront financial investments if farmers are not already utilizing them. Many factors impact what conservation practices are feasible in different regions and cropping systems. Cover crops are used on less than 5% of cropland, while, reduced tillage and no-till are used on 25% and 28% of cropland, respectively. The percent of land using a combination of any is likely also lower. And in the current down crop economy, it is difficult for crop farmers to invest in new machinery and inputs that would allow more cropland to use these needed feedstock conservation practices. If biofuels producers hope farmers continue to utilize and grow these practices on farms, they must provide significant premiums for feedstocks. Without guarantees that their investments will be returned through crop premiums or credit passthroughs, it will likely be slow going to grow eligible feedstock acres, particularly with only four years before 45Z faces expiration again.

Conclusion

Even with the OBBBA changes to 45Z eligibility, there are still many needed clarifications before the credit can be used. In addition, the uncertainty on whether farmers will be compensated for lowering emissions of feedstocks and downstream biofuels may make it difficult to truly maximize the growth of biofuels, as the 45Z credit was created to do.

Regardless, biofuels producers will likely begin planning how to take advantage of this extended tax credit. If federal agencies quickly provide workable guidance for 45Z, farmers can plan for future crop years to take advantage of the expanding markets for biofuels. When bumper crops are pushing down crop prices, increasing market demand is crucial for supporting crop prices and farm income. 45Z and biofuels production, particularly with the OBBBA investments in domestic feedstocks, represents a step forward in encouraging demand for major American crops. But without clear implementation and a fair path for farmers to benefit, the full potential of the credit may fall short.",https://www.fb.org/imgz/Analysis/MarketIntel/MI-Graphics/_socialwFacebook/242960/MI_45Z_16x9.jpg,N,,2025-07-24 12:56:21.467656

Low-carbon hydrogen, also known as blue hydrogen, is produced from natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, while green hydrogen is generated through electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources. Hydrogen derivatives, such as ammonia and methanol, can be utilized across various sectors, including transportation, industry and power generation.

For a deeper dive into hydrogen's potential, read our article on Why green hydrogen could play a major role in powering our sustainable future and explore our hydrogen solutions.

Methanol: A versatile fuel for lowering emissions

Methanol, available in both low-carbon and green forms, is another critical component of the energy transition. Low-carbon methanol, or blue methanol, is produced from natural gas with CCS, while e-methanol, also known as green methanol, is derived from renewable feedstocks. Methanol can serve as a fuel for the shipping or automotive industry, a feedstock for chemicals and a hydrogen carrier, making it a versatile solution for reducing emissions.

Ammonia: A key fuel source and energy carrier

Ammonia, both low-carbon and green, is emerging as a vital fuel and feedstock in the energy transition. Low-carbon ammonia, or blue ammonia, is produced from natural gas with CCS, while green ammonia is synthesized using renewable energy. This versatile chemical compound can be used as a hydrogen carrier, a fuel for maritime and other energy-intensive industries and a feedstock for fertilizers, making it essential for achieving sustainability goals.

Backed by the European Green Deal and the Paris Agreement, the sector reiterates its full commitment to decarbonising air travel.

“SAF is no longer a distant solution, it is a reality that must scale now,” the statement said. “It presents the opportunity to improve the EU’s energy security, strengthen its economic prosperity and bolster climate innovation.”

The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation has already played a key role, prompting SAF production to grow from almost zero to 1.2 million tonnes by 2024.

But with €61 billion needed annually to decarbonise aviation, the industry warns that high costs, regulatory complexity, and a lack of investment instruments are holding back progress.

The 10-point action plan for 2025–2026 calls for extended SAF allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System, targeted funding for e-SAF and bio-SAF projects and risk-reducing financial products from the European Investment Bank.

It also urges a revenue certainty mechanism — such as contracts for difference — to de-risk production investment and create a thriving SAF market.

Additional actions include simplifying regulation, increasing access to renewable electricity and eligible biomass, and supporting the testing and certification of new e-SAF technologies.

The aviation ecosystem emphasises the need for collaboration across Member States, EU bodies and private investors to meet 2030 targets.

“ReFuelEU Aviation is the backbone of Europe’s SAF strategy but its success relies on swift, coordinated action to resolve the remaining investment and implementation barriers,” the group concluded.

The announcement, made by both companies, brings Avolon’s total Airbus order book to 413 aircraft, highlighting its growing role in shaping the future of fuel-efficient aviation.

A Fleet Reboot Built on Confidence

Avolon’s huge order isn’t just about numbers; it’s a statement. With 264 A321neo and 79 A330-900 now on the way, the Dublin-based lessor is betting on fuel-efficient, versatile jets that work well for both short and long-haul routes.

Andy Cronin, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Avolon, emphasized:

“This order demonstrates our strong confidence in the long‑term demand for new aircraft. Our scale and balance sheet position us to support our airline customers’ expansion and replacement needs into the next decade.”

And Benoît de Saint‑Exupéry, Airbus EVP Sales, added:

“Lessors are excellent barometers… this endorsement illustrates the strong attractiveness (…) covering the market space from domestic to long haul routes.”

Aircraft Highlights

A330neo: Powered by Rolls‑Royce Trent 7000 engines, offering a 7,200 nm (13,300 km) range and cutting fuel burn and CO₂ emissions by up to 25%. According to Airbus, it also features the revamped Airspace cabin, which offers enhanced passenger comfort, lighting, and connectivity.

A321neo: The star of Airbus’s single-aisle family, boasting a 20% fuel efficiency improvement, 50% noise reduction, and up to 244 seats with a 7,400 km reach, makes it a top pick for high-density routes

Both models currently support up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with Airbus targeting 100% compliance by 2030

Timing & Strategic Context

Deliveries are scheduled to take place between 2026 and 2033, allowing Avolon to gradually introduce these new jets as older aircraft are retired and demand continues to rise. This aligns perfectly with the firm's robust Q2 2025 performance, which saw net income climb 36% to US$143 million, and an owned, managed, and committed fleet reaching 1,166 aircraft, including 532 new-tech jets.

Environmental Investment

Avolon also stated earlier that it’s on track to have 75% of its fleet comprised of new-technology, fuel-efficient aircraft by 2025, a clear indication of its shift toward lower-emission flying. The company is also aiming for net-zero carbon emissions in its operations, showing its dedication to leading the sustainability space.

While it hasn’t broken down exact numbers in the order book, this direction lines up with its message that the majority of upcoming deliveries are next-gen, environmentally friendlier jets.

Bottom Line

Lessors like Avolon often act as early indicators of where airline strategies are headed. This latest order sends a strong message on two fronts:

Sustained global demand for fuel‑efficient, versatile aircraft is expected to stay high as airlines prioritize carbon cuts and operational efficiency.

Avolon is doubling down on balance‑sheet strength to offer airlines both new aircraft and flexible delivery options for the next decade.

With OEMs still working through post-pandemic supply chain challenges, Avolon’s strong order book, anchored by Airbus and Boeing, gives it the flexibility to move faster than most and meet demand without being held up.

What to Watch Next

Conversion into leases: Which airlines will take up the delivery slots, especially for the A330neos?

Shareholder vote: The Transaction requires approval from Bohai Leasing by the end of August.

Sustainability edge: Will airlines prioritize lessors with cleaner offerings as emissions regulation becomes stricter?

This latest order not only reinforces Avolon’s long-standing partnership with Airbus but also highlights its growing role in the global shift toward cleaner, more efficient fleets, while giving it the scale and flexibility to support airlines well into the next decade.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/68823aa89f5a1cd4c92125ee_Avolon%20A321neo%20A330neo.jpg,N,,2025-07-24 11:56:30.274356

(NASDAQ: GEVO) expands in the carbon market by selling its first carbon removal credits. A global financial and tech company purchased Puro.earth-certified CO₂ Removal Certificates (CORCs) to offset corporate travel emissions and is ready to retire immediately. These CORCs promise real and permanent CO₂ removal from the atmosphere. They also help buyers achieve their climate goals with measurable and trustworthy results.

The company’s innovative technology makes it a pioneer in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable gasoline, chemicals, and materials with low-carbon methods. Notably, it operates one of the largest dairy-based Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) facilities in the U.S. These efforts support a clean energy future and also benefit farming communities.

Gevo: Pioneering Carbon Removals with Verified Results

The press release highlights that Gevo’s CORCs provide genuine carbon abatement. Each credit corresponds to actual tons of CO₂ removed through Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). With these credits ready for retirement, buyers can claim climate benefits right away.

This sale addresses the growing demand for reliable, verifiable carbon removals. As companies want to reduce their carbon footprints, Gevo’s CORCs will provide a strong method to offset emissions, particularly from hard-to-reduce sources like travel.

The next-generation energy company is focused on renewable fuels and chemicals. Its mission has three main goals: energy security, carbon reduction, and rural economic growth.

Significantly, in Q1, Gevo recorded over 100,000 metric tons of carbon abatement, now viewed as a marketable product. This includes captured and sequestered carbon, plus emissions avoided from using low-carbon fuels.

Alex Clayton, Chief Business Development Officer for Gevo, says,

“These are real sales of credits for carbon dioxide removal that are being generated right now. Customers should feel confident in the CORCs we provide due to the rigor Gevo and Puro.earth are putting into every step of the process. We previously said that after our purchase of Gevo North Dakota that we would be selling carbon and that’s what we’re doing.”

North Dakota Ethanol Facility: A Hub for Clean Energy and Carbon Capture

Gevo’s North Dakota ethanol production facility plays a crucial role in capturing and storing CO₂. This plant produces 65 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol annually from 500 acres. Its clean fuels meet demand in areas with strict emissions targets, like Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alberta.

Besides ethanol, the facility generates over 200,000 tons annually of co-products, such as distillers’ grains and vegetable oils, supporting a circular economy.

Permanent CO₂ Storage with Massive Potential

Gevo North Dakota has a Class VI CCS well and lease rights for 5,800 acres in the Broom Creek geological formation. This formation can store up to 1 million metric tons of CO₂ each year. Currently, it sequesters about 180,000 metric tons per year, but Gevo aims to significantly increase this amount.

The geology allows carbon to stay underground for over 1,000 years, meeting top permanence standards in the carbon removal market. With ample pore space and wellhead capacity, the facility offers long-term growth for sequestered carbon-based credits.

As already mentioned, these CORCs are certified under Puro.earth’s strict standards, ensuring they meet key criteria for permanence, additionality, and traceability. The credits are available now and can be retired immediately for verified decarbonization today—not decades from now.

Fueling the Future with Renewable Products

Gevo’s North Dakota ethanol facility is part of a bigger vision. Ethanol serves as the feedstock for many of Gevo’s downstream products, including alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuels and renewable chemicals. These drop-in fuels fit directly into existing infrastructure, speeding up the shift to clean energy.

By producing renewable fuel from regeneratively grown crops, Gevo seeks to change agricultural practices while enhancing the global food supply. The company supports low-carbon farming methods, sourcing feedstocks from sustainable farmers.

Instead of choosing between food or fuel, Gevo uses a “nutrition-first approach”—extracting proteins for food and using starch for fuel. This system maximizes crop value and supports health for both people and the environment.

A Systems Approach to Sustainability

Gevo’s strategy stands out due to its “systems thinking” model. Everything—from feedstock sourcing to production and carbon tracking—is designed for efficiency and transparency. It provides end-to-end monitoring through its Verity subsidiary. This ensures accurate measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) of sustainability attributes across the supply chain.

This focus on carbon intensity and life cycle impact gives the SAF giant a competitive edge in renewable energy. It also bolsters rural economies by creating jobs, enhancing infrastructure, and attracting long-term investments.

Gevo Leads the Shift: Carbon Capture as a Market Opportunity

The first sale of CORCs is a big step for Gevo. However, it’s just the beginning. The company aims to grow its CCS operations and increase carbon abatement. With strong geological resources, modern infrastructure, and proven technology, it is set to lead in carbon removal and clean fuels.

Traditionally, CO₂ has been seen as waste or used in industries like enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Gevo captures biogenic CO₂ from its operations and then stores the gas underground, keeping it safe and harmless. This method prevents emissions and turns carbon into a valuable asset through CORCs.

As per industry reports, right now, North America and Europe lead the world in CCS development. Together, they make up about 80% of all upcoming capture and storage capacity. However, other regions are beginning to catch up.

And Gevo is now helping companies offset emissions by monetizing permanent CO₂ removal. This creates a practical market solution and supports clean energy production in the U.S.

In conclusion, Gevo’s entry into the carbon removal market with CORCs underscores its commitment to decarbonization and innovation. By linking renewable fuels with certified carbon capture, Gevo delivers a reliable solution that supports both climate goals and community growth.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2342984919.jpg,N,,2025-07-24 11:56:37.619441

Terminal in Long Beach, California.","Mitsubishi Corp. and ENEOS Corp. have signed definitive agreements to invest in what they tout will be Hawaii’s largest renewable fuels plant, already under construction at Par Pacific Holdings Inc.’s refinery in Kapolei.

The facility is expected to start production by year-end with a capacity of about 61 million gallons a year, the three companies said in a joint statement.

Houston, Texas-based Par Pacific and Japanese companies Mitsubishi and ENEOS will form a joint venture called Hawaii Renewables LLC for the project.

ENEOS and Mitsubishi will create Alohi Renewable Energy LLC, which will buy a 36.5 percent stake in Hawaii Renewables for $100 million in cash. Par Pacific will retain majority ownership and lead the project’s execution and operation.

“Once fully operational, Hawaii Renewables will be the state’s largest renewable fuels manufacturing facility and is expected to produce approximately 61 million gallons per year of renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, renewable naphtha and low-carbon liquified petroleum gases”, the companies said.

The plant will initially produce up to 60 percent SAF with flexibility to process different feedstocks and “shift yields to RD based on market conditions”, they said.

“The project’s attractive capital cost, along with its operating and distribution cost advantages, are key differentiators”, the companies said.

“Hawaii Renewables will leverage Par Pacific's existing refining and logistics infrastructure and Lutros LLC’s new and advantaged pretreatment technology”.

Par Pacific says it owns and operates 219,000 barrels per day of refining capacity across four sites in Hawaii, the Pacific Northwest and the Rockies. It also has 13 million barrels of storage capacity, as well as marine, rail, rack and pipeline assets.

The Hawaii renewable fuels plant will have access to Mitsubishi’s Petro-Diamond Inc. Terminal in Long Beach, California.

“As Japan's leading energy company, ENEOS will strengthen the partnership by leveraging its historical success in fuel refining and trading across Asia-Pacific and North America”, the statement said.

Par Pacific president and chief executive Will Monteleone said, “Creating the Hawaii Renewables joint venture brings together the best of our three organizations and yields additional scale and expertise across feedstock origination, commercial optimization, and market access throughout the Pacific Basin”.

The establishment of the joint venture requires regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, the companies said.

The Hawaii project is one of two SAF projects that the United States Energy Information Administration expects to come onstream in the country this year, the other being the New Rise Reno plant in Nevada.

The Reno plant started operation early 2025 with a nameplate capacity of 38 million gallons a year.

The owner, which rebranded to XCF Global Inc. after merging with Focus Impact BH3 Acquisition Co., announced earlier this month an investment plan of nearly $1 billion over the next three years to build a global SAF production portfolio.

Four of the projects under the plan are in the U.S., including the Reno plant. The three projects still to be built is planned to each have a capacity of 40 million gallons per annum.

New Rise Reno 2 is planned to be completed 2027. Another project in Ft. Myers, Florida, will be built on a site with access to port infrastructure and is expected to be completed 2028. The third, also targeted for start-up 2028, will rise in Wilson, North Carolina, eyeing East Coast markets.

Microsoft Corp. is partnering with Sublime Systems to reduce its indirect greenhouse gas emissions through a first-of-a-kind deal to buy low-carbon cement products from the startup.

Under the contract, Microsoft can purchase up to 622,500 metric tons of Sublime’s cement over a period of six to nine years. Microsoft can claim the carbon reductions associated with that cement in its own emissions accounting, even if it doesn’t use the material itself. If Microsoft passes on buying the product, the Somerville, Massachusetts-based Sublime can sell it to local buyers but the software giant still gets to claim the carbon savings.

Sublime uses an electrochemical process that eliminates limestone, which is cement’s main ingredient and releases carbon dioxide when it’s heated up and broken down.

Microsoft’s push to build more data centers supporting artificial intelligence has driven the company further away from its goal of becoming carbon-negative by 2030. That AI expansion has helped boost the tech giant’s emissions by 30% since 2020. More than 96% of the company’s emissions are Scope 3, or indirect, and materials like cement used in data center construction make up a big share of them.

It’s Microsoft’s first time doing a deal like this for building materials, though the company and others have used the same approach for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable energy. Called an environmental attribute certificate, it allows the purchasing company to make a sustainability claim based on environmentally friendly goods – like clean jet fuel, renewable electricity or low-carbon cement – that it didn’t use directly. But these certificates often promise more than they deliver, research shows.

“Our priority, first and foremost, is always buying and installing low-carbon materials physically that are already on the market today,” said Katie Ross, Microsoft’s director of carbon reduction strategy and market development. “But the challenge is they don’t exist at the scale or in all of the locations that we need to procure today.”

The companies declined to say how much the deal is worth.

The challenges of green cement

It’s not just a Microsoft problem. Although cement accounts for about 8% of global emissions, it’s hard to decarbonize partly because construction is a risk-averse industry with thin margins and high safety standards, according to Nik Sawe, a senior policy analyst in the industry program at Energy Innovation Policy and Technology LLC, an energy and climate think tank. That means construction companies have been reluctant to take up cement alternatives developed by startups, which are cleaner but also currently more expensive and untested in the real world.

At its 250-ton-per-year pilot plant in Somerville, Sublime has reduced emissions by 90% compared to traditional cement, according to Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Leah Ellis. Sublime will start delivering on its deal with Microsoft when its first 30,000-ton commercial plant is operational. It’s slated to be completed in 2027.

Cement is heavy, and transporting it over long distances doesn’t make sense economically, Ellis said. The deal allows Microsoft to support the scale-up of Sublime’s technology even if it doesn’t have a construction project near the startup’s plant, she added.

Do environmental attribute certificates work?

In the past, some of these certificates have supported renewable projects that would have been developed anyway, meaning they didn’t help bring additional wind and solar online as promised, studies show. Microsoft has said it plans to phase out its use of unbundled renewable energy certificates in future years.

If deals like the one the company signed with Sublime proliferate, the clean cement industry will need to prove that the certificates it is offering are verifiable and avoid carbon emissions that manufacturers would have generated otherwise, according to a 2024 report on structuring demand for lower-carbon materials co-published by RMI and Microsoft. That includes ensuring that the products’ environmental benefits aren’t double-counted, or claimed by multiple entities as a reduction on their emissions ledger.

“Checks must be in place along the way to increase confidence that every purchase of a certificate will deliver its expected outcome,” the report’s authors wrote.

For this deal with Microsoft, other customers who buy Sublime’s cement won’t be able to lay claim to its environmental benefits, Ellis said.

Analysts had expected 302.5 million euros on average in a company-provided consensus

""Our sustainable aviation fuel sales increased close to 80% quarter on quarter, benefiting from additional SAF production capacity at our renewables refinery in Rotterdam,"" CEO Heikki Malinen said in a statement.

The rise in SAF sales drove the sales volume in Neste's renewable products unit to a new quarterly record of 1,096 thousand tonnes. The unit's sales volume margin fell 5% to $361 per ton, but exceeded analysts' forecast of $329 per tonne.

""We saw positive developments in the biofuel regulation both in the US and EU, largely supporting long-term renewables demand,"" Malinen, who joined the company last year, said.

Neste shares were up 15% as of 1000GMT. RBC analysts said in a research note that the second quarter was a ""key litmus test"" for Neste's new management, adding the results boded well for investor sentiment.

However, Malinen warned that the market environment was volatile and headwinds from global trade tensions were expected to continue.

Neste has been battling an excess supply in the renewable fuels market, pressuring its sales volumes and leading to a reduction of around 510 jobs globally earlier in 2025.

Although the group said it still expected its annual sales volumes to improve from 2024, it also forecast continuing oversupply in the renewable fuels market for the year.

Malinen told Reuters that he expects the oversupply to continue in 2026 or even beyond that, depending among others on the regulation process in the European Union.

Combined with weak demand and high input costs, oversupply had made Neste cut its forecast for the renewables sales margin three times in 2024.

Operation Northern Phoenix used the former Loring Air Force Base’s runways for the first run of its five-year aviation training effort.
The two aviation companies, whose names the authority is not yet releasing, would boost the authority’s plan to bring more aerospace jobs onto the former base.
“Due to the added attention that Operation Northern Phoenix has brought to Loring, there are two national aerospace companies that are looking at Loring as a potential home for their operations,” LDA President and CEO Jonathan Judkins said.
The Loring Air Museum and the LDA last year were at odds over the hangar’s future.","Thanks to a military training program that launched in May, two national aerospace companies could be coming to northern Maine.

Operation Northern Phoenix used the former Loring Air Force Base’s runways for the first run of its five-year aviation training effort. Word of that event spread in aviation circles, and the businesses reached out to the Loring Commerce Centre.

The Loring Development Authority works to attract business, housing and jobs to Loring’s 3,800 acres. Occupants have included Brunswick-based Green 4 Maine and, most recently, the Taste of Maine Potato Chip Co. The two aviation companies, whose names the authority is not yet releasing, would boost the authority’s plan to bring more aerospace jobs onto the former base. They would also ensure a future for its airport infrastructure, including its famed arch hangar.

“Due to the added attention that Operation Northern Phoenix has brought to Loring, there are two national aerospace companies that are looking at Loring as a potential home for their operations,” LDA President and CEO Jonathan Judkins said. “One of them would use the arch hangar, and the other would use the former tactical alert hangar.”

Northern Phoenix is a collaboration of the U.S. Air Force and New Hampshire Air National Guard, Judkins said. This year, multiple C-130 aircraft used the runways for test runs in a program that will grow over the next four years to include Black Hawk helicopters and possibly B-52s.

Next year’s training is slated in June. The events will see the addition of a mobile tower and lighting system to the runway that will remain at Loring, he said. When the five years is up, the Air Force will decide whether to continue training on-site.

Besides the return of a military mission, the training acquainted many more people with Loring, Judkins said. As a result, the commerce center has drawn interest from both public and private entities, which could bring good news on the job-creation front.

“For Loring, the most important thing about this is the jobs they will bring. That’s the LDA’s primary goal, creating jobs in Aroostook,” he said.

In the last couple of years, the authority has announced plans for a quantum research facility and a $4 billion sustainable aviation fuel production plant. Combined, they are projected to add more than 2,000 construction jobs and nearly 700 production jobs.

If the two aerospace companies decide to move in, it’s unclear how many jobs they would bring, but reuse of the base’s existing infrastructure also means that taxpayer assets will be preserved, rather than left to deteriorate, Judkins said.

Built in the late 1940s, the historic arch hangar is one of only two of its kind, according to Maine author Arend Thibodeau. The double-cantilever structure was designed to house the B-36 Peacemaker.

The Loring Air Museum and the LDA last year were at odds over the hangar’s future. The museum wanted it preserved as a historical artifact, while developers said it should be used for aerospace development.

While some have said the hangar is crumbling, Judkins said it is in reasonable shape. It has a new heating system and working electricity. Renovations would be mainly cosmetic, such as cleaning, painting, repairing doors and refinishing the roof.

The concrete roof has an insulation layer topped off with a membrane, he said. The membrane is peeling and there is a hole in the insulation, but the concrete is intact. The LDA plans to adhere a waterproof resin to the concrete and insulate inside the building.

Little used since the base closed in 1994, Loring’s airport has seen a flurry of activity in recent months.

Last fall, the Federal Aviation Administration reclassified Loring as a public airport. The Department of Defense also granted the LDA a $1 million Defense Community Infrastructure Program grant. The authority will use $750,000 of that to create an airport master plan, Judkins said. The remainder will pay for an electrical assessment and planning for grid stability in case of a catastrophic event.

The authority is also pursuing acceptance into the Federal Aviation Administration’s National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems, he said. That would make Loring part of the Military Airport Program, which could bring funds to improve other infrastructure and add additional aircraft hangars.

Judkins maintained that Loring’s greatest value has always been in its layout — the miles of paved, business-ready runway and ground.

“You can build any business you want on that runway,” he said. “You’re only limited by what you can imagine.”",https://thecounty.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ArchHangar-072024-pjb-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-24 11:56:55.485986

The document explains how Syzygy’s NovaSAF™ platform provides a scalable, policy-compatible, and economically feasible solution to help decarbonize the aviation sector, according to the press release.

Trevor Best, Syzygy Plasmonics’ CEO, emphasized that NovaSAF™ is more than just a product—it acts as a catalyst for policy advancement. He noted that the white paper demonstrates how technological innovation can assist regulators and industry players in achieving climate targets while also opening up new economic prospects.

With global regulators stepping up efforts to cut aviation emissions, the demand for SAF is projected to surpass 200 million metric tons per year by 2050. Yet, current production falls short by over 120 million metric tons. NovaSAF™ aims to close this gap by transforming biogenic methane and carbon dioxide into ASTM-certified SAF through the use of light-driven catalysts and renewable electricity. This process lowers equipment expenses, utilizes abundant feedstocks, and yields strong financial returns. In many cases, it competes favorably with the cost of HEFA and, under certain conditions, can even match Jet-A fuel prices.

Importantly, NovaSAF™ complies with both SAF and eSAF (electrofuels) standards under the EU’s RED III directive and the UK’s Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). A single NovaSAF facility produces fuel that qualifies under two separate categories: a portion as an Advanced Biofuel and the remainder as a Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO). This dual certification grants access to premium SAF markets and helps ensure the financial sustainability of investments.

The white paper also highlights Syzygy’s Rigel reactor technology, which runs on renewable electricity and avoids fossil fuel combustion. This technology, combined with the established Fischer-Tropsch process, converts biogas into a liquid that can then be hydrotreated into SAF. Syzygy’s innovation lies in integrating these technologies into a modular system that supports distributed, site-specific production.

The paper features Syzygy’s inaugural commercial project, NovaSAF 1, based in Uruguay. This plant will convert manure from 14,000 cows into 400,000 gallons (1,100 tons) of SAF annually, powered by a national grid that is more than 90% renewable. The project serves as a proof of concept for the platform’s scalability and its potential to reduce methane and aviation emissions simultaneously.

Syzygy’s approach centers on expanding SAF production through replicable projects and technology licensing, aiming to fulfill the increasing demand for low-carbon aviation fuels over the next quarter-century.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-7.png,N,,2025-07-24 14:56:30.489392

The agreement includes more than $550 billion in new investment by Japan into core American industries. The agreement also includes Japan purchasing $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol and sustainable aviation fuel. Japan will also immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75%, with a major expansion of import quotas.

“We just completed a massive trade deal with Japan,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Japan will open its country to trade on items like cars, trucks, rice, and other agricultural products.” The president also said Japan will invest $550 billion in the U.S. “at my discretion.” He added that the U.S. would receive 90 percent of any profits, although he didn’t provide further details. The White House later on Wednesday released a fact sheet outlining some of the details: https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-unprecedented-u-s-japan-strategic-trade-and-investment-agreement/

Many agriculture groups in the U.S. have started to share their reaction to the news of a trade deal with Japan. “We appreciate the work that the administration has dedicated to brokering a deal with Japan, worth $2.7 billion, and we welcome today’s announcement,” says National Corn Growers Association President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “Japan is the second largest market for U.S. corn exports, and we support any effort to expand the purchase of corn and corn products, like ethanol. U.S. corn growers produce an abundant crop year in and year out, and NCGA has long advocated for increased access to foreign markets, which will support American farmers and rural economies.”

In a statement, U.S. Grains Council President and CEO Ryan LeGrand said “The U.S. Grains Council applauds the Trump Administration on this agreement with our second largest trading partner – Japan. In the 2023-24 marketing year, Japan was the second largest importer of U.S. corn; the third largest importer of U.S. sorghum; the fourth largest importer of U.S. barley; and the 9th largest importer of U.S. distillers dried grains with solubles, totaling 14 million metric tons in corn-equivalent exports or $5.95 billion. This deal is an embodiment of our countries’ longstanding partnership and includes ethanol and SAF that fits into Japan’s policies of increasing the use of renewable fuels, that include U.S. ethanol. The Council looks forward to nurturing the important trade relationship for many more years to come.”

U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) President and CEO Dan Halstrom issued the following statement as well saying that “USMEF greatly appreciates the Trump administration’s agreement with Japan, reassuring and expanding opportunities in the #2 export destination for U.S. beef and pork. In President Trump’s first term, the critical U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement was reached, returning U.S. red meat to a level playing field in Japan and restoring its position as an extremely reliable market. According to the information released by the White House, the new agreement focuses on reinforcing the long-term economic partnership between the U.S. and Japan, which for decades has delivered tremendous benefits for the U.S. livestock and meat industries and for Japanese consumers, importers and customers. USMEF looks forward to continued growth and mutual benefits, and we thank the team at USTR and the Trump administration for another agreement reached in the critical Asia Pacific region.”

Growth Energy, the nation’s largest biofuel trade association, applauded the White House and President Trump as well following the announcement of this week’s trade deals with not only Japan, but also with Indonesia, that would open new markets for American biofuels and other agricultural co-products. The trade deal with Indonesia is expected to eliminate up to 99 percent of the tariff barriers on U.S. goods – including the 30 percent tariff currently imposed on U.S. ethanol exports. As part of the deal with Japan, the White House secured a commitment to purchase $8 billion in U.S. agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, ethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

“Ethanol exports set a record in 2024, and President Trump’s latest deals will help to ensure that American farmers and biofuel producers continue to benefit from new and growing markets in Asia,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “We commend President Trump for following through on his commitment to unleash American energy dominance and tear down unfair barriers to exports from rural America.

He added: “Business engagement should help to build sounder policy with better outcomes for the public, but unaccountable lobbying breeds public mistrust.
This important report removes the guesswork needed to piece together what kind of lobbying is taking place.” Weak lobbying laws openDemocracy has previously reported extensively on the ways that the UK’s weak lobbying laws allow corporate influence to secretly shape policy.
Oil and gas licensing In 2022, the UK government quietly dropped two criteria from its ‘Climate Compatibility Checkpoint’ after lobbying from the fossil fuel industry.
This industry lobbying has led to indecision and disruption on government plans.","Climate-focused think tank InfluenceMap has uncovered that industry influence appears to have led to the delay and dilution of UK policies on the roll-out of heat pumps, the development of ‘sustainable’ aviation fuel and the granting of new oil and gas licenses.

In each case, it found that lobbyists representing fossil fuel actors that stood to lose billions from progressive climate regulations were able to influence the Conservative government’s policy without scrutiny.

While InfluenceMap’s report looks at policies relating to the UK’s net-zero ambitions, its findings on the way the UK’s lax laws allow lobbying to be conducted in secret can be applied across sectors. The think tank is calling for reforms to address this and close the “major transparency gap”.

The secrecy around lobbying, which has been at the heart of many government scandals in recent years, is a major driver of the disillusionment in British politics.

Three-quarters of the public believe the government is “rigged to serve the rich and influential”, according to polling conducted by More in Common and University College London’s Policy Lab last year.

InfluenceMap’s findings illustrate “how inadequate and opaque lobbying rules undermine effective policymaking”, said Alastair McCapra, the CEO of the UK lobbying industry body.

He added:

“Business engagement should help to build sounder policy with better outcomes for the public, but unaccountable lobbying breeds public mistrust. This important report removes the guesswork needed to piece together what kind of lobbying is taking place.”

Weak lobbying laws

openDemocracy has previously reported extensively on the ways that the UK’s weak lobbying laws allow corporate influence to secretly shape policy.

Our investigations have now been backed up by InfluenceMap, which has found a huge gap exists between the lobbying that takes place and that which is disclosed. This means the British public often has no way of knowing who is swaying policy.

Comparing transparency rules in the UK, the European Parliament, the US, Canada and France, InfluenceMap found that the UK has by far the worst system.

Of the five, only the UK exempts lobbyists who work in-house for a company, rather than for an agency or consultancy, from registering with a statutory lobbying watchdog. Less than 15% of lobbyists working in the UK need to register because of this rule.

The firms on the register must publish a list of clients on whose behalf they have lobbied each quarter. But they do not have to publish any details about the lobbying, including whether it involved written correspondence or a meeting and what legislation or policy was discussed.

Registered lobbyists also only need to declare clients for whom they lobbied government ministers and senior officials. There is no requirement to name clients when they approached other MPs and peers, including those on select committees, or influential government advisers.

The Committee for Standards in Public Life, an independent public body that advises the prime minister on lobbying and other aspects of public office, has consistently recommended the government publish a single, searchable database of all meetings with lobbyists.

Its recommendations would expand the scope of the current register considerably, requiring lobbyists to disclose the specific policies or legislation they discussed at meetings with government ministers and special advisers.

InfluenceMap has also called on the government to take up this recommendation and address the fundamental flaws in the lobbying act by including in-house lobbyists and publishing all responses to government policy consultants as standard.

Susan Hawley, executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said the report “starkly demonstrates how major transparency gaps in the UK’s lobbying regime are undermining the development of good climate policy.”

“We fully support their recommendations to make lobbying much more transparent and bring the UK in line with international best practice. These reforms would support more participatory and open decision-making to help rebuild public trust and ensure better decision-making, widening the evidence base for policy making and reducing risks of policy capture by vested interests,” she said.

Oil and gas licensing

In 2022, the UK government quietly dropped two criteria from its ‘Climate Compatibility Checkpoint’ after lobbying from the fossil fuel industry. The checkpoint is used to assess whether proposed oil and gas licenses align with the UK’s climate change goals.

Oil giants BP and Shell and their industry association, Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), responded to a consultation on the checkpoint by objecting to the inclusion of two key metrics for measuring the impact of fossil fuels, according to InfluenceMap’s analysis of consultation responses obtained via Freedom of Information requests.

The measures they opposed would have required the government to consider ‘Scope 3 emissions’ and the ‘global production gap’ when issuing new oil and gas licences.

Scope 3 emissions are produced during end-use and contribute the largest share of all emissions from oil and gas production, while the production gap tracks the discrepancy between planned fossil fuel production and what’s needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C.

The government dropped both criteria from the final checkpoint, which instead focuses solely on operational emissions, which represent only a fraction of total emissions from oil and gas projects.

This outcome, InfluenceMap’s report notes, strongly aligns with the positions advocated for by BP, Shell, and OEUK, suggesting their lobbying efforts were successful.

The following year, the government approved 100 new North Sea oil and gas licences, which had a potential emissions footprint equivalent to Denmark’s annual output.

InfluenceMap’s report also highlights the issues around government consultations on proposed policies, pointing out that, as in this case, lobbyists typically use these to suggest amendments in favour of their clients, but their responses are not published as standard.

Similarly, unlike in the other four Parliaments InfluenceMap looked at, corporations in the UK are not required to declare their engagement on policies, how much they spend on lobbying, or which legislation or decisions they are targeting.

It highlights that this can lead to a situation in which companies make voluntary corporate disclosures that fail to capture the true extent of this advocacy. In this case, InfluenceMap found BP published a summary of its response to the checkpoint that omitted key lines of its opposition, which were only revealed later through Freedom of Information requests.

Rachel Davies, advocacy director at Transparency International UK, said:

“This report highlights, yet again, the glaring gaps in our lobbying transparency regime and the potential risks of favouring a small group of vested interests at the public’s expense.

“The UK needs to catch up to other comparable democracies and act swiftly to introduce a comprehensive lobbying register with meaningful disclosures.”

Domestic hydrogen

It is broadly agreed that, in the UK, hydrogen is not a viable solution for decarbonising domestic heating and is an especially bad alternative to heat pumps. Much of our hydrogen comes from burning gas or coal and it cannot be transported through our existing pipelines without massive and costly infrastructure changes.

This reality has been set out by different independent bodies advising the UK government.

In 2021, the Climate Change Committee warned that hydrogen had “not yet been proven at scale and should not be a cause to delay other options” such as the roll-out of heat pumps or low-carbon heat networks. Two years later, the National Infrastructure Commission said the government “should not support the roll-out of hydrogen heating” because there is “no public policy case” for its use.

As InfluenceMap’s report notes, this has not prevented the gas industry from waging a successful lobbying campaign in a bid to shore up its market position – with a clear impact on government policy.

The think tank found the industry pursued its cause in a number of ways, including setting up Hello Hydrogen, a campaign fronted by TV star Rachel Riley, to make the case for using hydrogen in homes to the public in 2022. While the campaign did not declare its funders, its director was also a director of Cadent Gas, the UK’s largest gas distribution network.

Cadent is one of the funders of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Hydrogen, which has publicly called for hydrogen to play a part in domestic heating. The APPG’s other funders include Equinor, Shell and the Energy and Utilities Alliance, a lobbying body run by Mike Foster, the former Labour MP for Worcester (home to Worcester Bosch, a major manufacturer of gas boilers).

Other fossil fuel firms and industry lobbying bodies have also consistently pushed for the use of hydrogen in domestic heating in letters to parliamentary select committees and responses to government consultations.

Ahead of last year’s general election, Centrica (formerly British Gas) wrote to the Public Accounts Committee, which examines the value for money of government projects, to call for further public investment in hydrogen for home heating. The firm had written to the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee in support of the technology less than 12 months earlier.

This industry lobbying has led to indecision and disruption on government plans. A February 2023 report by the House of Lords Committee blamed mixed messages on the effectiveness of hydrogen from the government and industry for the poor uptake of a publicly subsidised scheme for heat pumps, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create many jobs.

The lords’ report concluded:

“Hydrogen is not a serious option for home heating for the short to medium-term and misleading messages, including from the government, are negatively affecting take-up of established low-carbon home heating technologies like heat pumps.”

The UK’s heat pump roll-outs have lagged behind those of its neighbours. Just 55,000 heat pumps were installed in the UK in 2019, compared to 600,000 in France, according to a study cited in the InfluenceMap report.

In the UK, this reportedly created around 2,000 jobs and reduced emissions of CO₂ by 0.08 million tonnes (MT); in France 30,000 jobs were created and 0.84 MT of CO₂ emissions avoided.

‘Sustainable’ aviation fuel

InfluenceMap also uncovered how industry significantly influenced the government’s so-called ‘Jet Zero’ strategy for cutting emissions in the UK’s aviation industry, which is heavily reliant on fossil fuels.

Biofuels, largely made up of used cooking oils, are often suggested as an option for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), although they are generally accepted to be worse in terms of scalability than other, more advanced fuels, and much worse than just reducing the number of flights.

The government initially proposed limiting the use of used cooking oil for SAF to alleviate competition on the resource – which is increasingly in demand for other uses, such as producing biodiesel for cars – and to encourage investment in new technologies for the aviation industry.

The proposals included two options; either banning the use of used cooking oil for SAF altogether, or rapidly phasing down its use so that it would make up just 8.5% of total sustainable aviation fuel by 2040.

But the government’s final SAF policy was more closely aligned with industry preferences than scientific warnings, InfluenceMap found. It allows used cooking oil to make up 100% of SAF uptake in 2025 and 2026, 71% in 2030, and 35% in 2040.

InfluenceMap’s analysis reveals the weakened SAF mandate came after pressure from Shell, BP, the International Airlines Group (which owns several airlines), Airlines UK (the trade body for UK-registered airlines) and Virgin Atlantic airline.

It also found that business interests were overrepresented in parliamentary meetings on SAF while the policy was being shaped.

This can be seen in the make-up of Parliament’s Jet Zero Council, “a partnership between industry academia and government”, which was run by Heathrow’s chief operating officer, while the International Airlines Group chaired the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Delivery Group.

The council comprised 24 members from industry, three from academia and one from civil society. Ministers were also directly involved with the council, with then-prime minister Boris Johnson attending the group’s first meeting along with four ministers.

Transparency failures again played a key role. Not a single ministerial meeting on SAF referenced the weakening of the cooking oil cap in official records, and industry responses to consultations were only obtained through Freedom of Information.

The action marks a milestone for both partners on the journey to more sustainable aviation. Alternative fuels such as Synhelion’s solar fuel are crucial to the industry’s endeavors to achieve its ambitious carbon reduction objectives.

Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) has become the first airline in the world to integrate the solar fuel manufactured by the Swiss-based Synhelion clean-tech company into its regular flight operations. Synhelion delivered a first 190-liter barrel of synthetic crude oil from its DAWN production facility to a refinery in Northern Germany, where the oil, which had been manufactured using solar energy, was processed into certified Jet-A-1 aviation fuel. The fuel was then fed into SWISS’s flight operations infrastructure via the fuel supply system at Hamburg Airport.

The fuel supplied are some seven percent of the fuel required for a Hamburg-Zurich flight – a symbolic start, but a hugely significant one. It may sound little, but it’s a landmark for the aviation sector, confirming that Synhelion’s technology works and is ready for the next steps ahead. Its seamless integration into existing refinery processes is crucial to securing the swift global scalability of Synhelion’s technology.

“This first delivery of Synhelion’s solar fuel marks a genuine milestone in our long-standing partnership,” confirms SWISS CEO Jens Fehlinger. “We have intentionally invested in a Swiss start-up; and we are delighted to celebrate this landmark achievement together. This is the first time that solar fuel has been used in civil aviation. And we are truly proud to be playing such a pioneering role, in partnership with Synhelion, in driving and developing this vital new technology for a more sustainable aviation sector.”

“Sustainable fuels are a key lever in reducing air transport’s reliance on fossil fuels,” adds Synhelion co-founder and co-CEO Philipp Furler. “Our delivery of this first barrel to SWISS may be a symbolic action. But it’s a concrete one, too, towards a more sustainable aviation sector. This milestone brings us one step closer to globally scaling up our solar fuel technology. And we’re very grateful to have such invaluable support from our partners at SWISS and the Lufthansa Group as we continue on this journey.”

Next steps: certification and scale-up. Sustainable fuels such as Synhelion’s solar fuel are key if the aviation sector is to achieve its ambitious carbon reduction objectives. This is why it is so vital that all the parties involved play their full part and join other airlines, business and industry, the political world, the research field and consumers in driving and promoting the adoption of such fuels with all possible speed. SWISS has been serving as a strategic partner to Synhelion since 2020 to support the commercialization of the company’s pioneering technologies. SWISS has also been an investor in Synhelion since 2022.

Further steps remain before solar fuel can be more extensively used in the aviation sector. The facilities required to ensure continuous production of the fuel and adequate production capacities are now being developed to permit a commercial market entry from 2027. The EU Renewable Energy Directive stipulates that sustainable synthetic fuels must achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 70 percent compared to fossil kerosene. The life cycle assessment carried out by an independent institution confirms that the fuels from the DAWN production facility can significantly exceed this target. As a next step, Synhelion and SWISS are now jointly driving forward the sustainability certification of the production process and the fuel in accordance with the requirements of the EU directive.

Lufthansa Group: a long-standing commitment to sustainable fuels. As part of the Lufthansa Group, SWISS can both draw and build on decades of experience in the sustainable aviation fuel field. The Lufthansa Group is involved in research and pilot projects, is an active member of various industrywide alliances and offers numerous innovative sustainable aviation fuel products and incentives for both corporate and private customers. It has also concluded a number of long-term fuel procurement agreements which send a strong signal to the global fuel markets and help further drive and shape the industry’s transformation.

Fuel System

The announcement was about the development of the first prototype components of the aircraft’s advanced fuel system, as it has entered the testing phase. This included an initial trial using sustainable aviation fuel, designed to assess system compatibility. This achievement marks a pivotal step in the partnership, established in September 2023, which aims to deliver a fuel system designed to meet high-performance standards and reduce environmental impact. Volker Fuchs, owner and group chief executive officer of TEST-FUCHS, praised the progress:

“Seeing our prototype components enter the initial testing phase is a proud moment for our team. From the outset, our focus has been on delivering a fuel system that not only meets the highest safety and efficiency standards but also supports the use of SAF from day one.”

Importance of Fuel System

Nico Neumann, chief executive officer at Deutsche Aircraft, also commented on this achievement and its importance to the aircraft. Neumann said:

“This milestone reflects the strength of our valued partnership with TEST-FUCHS and our shared commitment to sustainable aviation.”

The fuel system plays a key role in the future of the D328eco. It stores, manages, and delivers fuel to the engines under all flight conditions. To ensure efficiency and reliability, it must maintain correct pressure, flow rate, and temperature.

The D328eco is designed to be fully compatible with 100% sustainable aviation fuel, including emerging power-to-liquid fuels. This means it requires a highly specialised fuel system that is capable of handling the different chemical properties of SAF compared to conventional Jet A-1 fuel, such as viscosity, temperature behaviour, and material compatibility.
