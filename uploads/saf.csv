Nature and industry transitions are unlocking investable opportunities, from regenerative agriculture to fossil-free steel; investable pipelines are growing across sectors.

With trillions in unmet financing needs for the Sustainable Development Goals, infrastructure and nature-positive transitions, leading investors will embed sustainability into their core strategy.

In 2025, sustainability has been overshadowed by geopolitics and election cycles dominating headlines. However, momentum around sustainable finance has not stalled.

Sustainable debt issuance topped $1 trillion in 2024 for the fifth consecutive year and private finance for nature has grown over elevenfold since 2020. This continued flow of capital reflects more than good intentions; rather, risks are becoming sharper.

Extreme weather, food insecurity and nature loss are actively reshaping economies and portfolios, making resilience a financial imperative, not a choice.

“

Nature finance is no longer emerging; those who act early will capture returns while helping set market-defining rules.

”

This year is about recalibrating for impact. Capital is entering food systems, nature, industry and infrastructure – embedding sustainability deeper into investment and corporate finance.

With available solutions, strengthening demand signals and increasingly measurable opportunities, the challenge now is execution. Leaders in banking, investment and policy have a narrow window to expediently scale solutions. Those who stay the course will protect portfolios and capture the first-mover advantage in the markets of tomorrow.

Connecting the real economy

Financing food systems transformation

Investors are moving beyond broad pledges and channelling capital into real-economy sectors – food systems are rising to the top.

Food underpins the global economy, accounting for 10% of gross domestic product and 40% of jobs. Yet, it is also highly vulnerable: droughts, floods and supply chain disruptions are driving inflation and destabilizing markets.

Transformation is necessary but it is also a major opportunity, as regenerative agriculture, resilient livestock practices and deforestation-free supply chains open new markets, diversify revenue streams and strengthen portfolios.

Momentum is already visible. Climate finance for agrifood systems rose over 300% since 2019, reaching $95 billion annually, according to the Climate Policy Initiative, while blended-finance vehicles are mobilizing billions annually across emerging markets.

A growing body of case studies demonstrates how capital is already being unlocked.

From Intesa Sanpaolo’s €23 billion programme extending reduced-rate loans to 172 agri-food supply chains in Italy, to GrowBeyond’s $100 million blended vehicle supporting smallholder farmers across the Association of Southeast Asian Nation states, and Aceli Africa’s $300 million mobilized across 3,500 loans to reach 1.5 million farmers and workers.

Despite the progress, agri-food systems require $1.1 trillion annually over the next five years, yet less than 5% of that is being met today. Closing this gap is critical but the trajectory is clear.

Financing the nature-positive transition

The world’s largest asset managers now recognize “nature capital” – biodiversity, water and soil – as fundamental to long-term performance.

The World Economic Forum estimates this opportunity to be $10 trillion in annual business value and nearly 400 million jobs by 2030 through nature-positive transitions.

Realizing this requires up to $2.7 trillion annually but capital flows are accelerating with private finance for nature growing from $9.4 billion in 2020 to more than $100 billion by 2024.

With nature underpinning the global economy, investors are starting to integrate it into portfolio assessments, closing the long-standing “data gap,” while pipelines of investable opportunities are expanding across sectors – from agri-food and chemicals to mining and water – supported by emerging financing models, policy frameworks and risk-sharing mechanisms.

Regulation is also advancing: the European Union’s (EU) Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the European Banking Authority’s Environmental, Social and Governance guidance and the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures are tightening expectations for nature-related risk reporting.

Nature finance is no longer emerging; those who act early will capture returns while helping set market-defining rules.

Financing industrial decarbonization

Net zero is impossible without tackling heavy industry and transport. Steel, cement, aluminium, aviation, shipping and chemicals produce over one-third of global carbon dioxide emissions. These sectors are among the hardest to decarbonize, still tied to fossil feedstocks and energy-intensive processes.

Yet progress is lagging: only $250 billion has been mobilized against a $1.6 trillion need for low-carbon materials. Clean technologies such as green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel and green ammonia exist but scaling is constrained by high upfront costs, fragmented demand and thin pipelines, especially in emerging economies.

The stakes are clear: delay risks stranded assets, disrupted supply chains, and lost growth.

“

For financial leaders, this is about shaping markets as much as preserving them.

”

Momentum is building. Sweden’s HYBRIT has delivered fossil-free steel to Volvo, Maersk is sailing methanol-fueled ships and Cemex is rolling out low-carbon cement across Latin America.

Governments are also shaping markets: the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is rewriting trade rules, Japan’s GX Promotion Act is directing subsidies and India, Brazil and Australia are betting on hydrogen hubs and green iron.

Finance is catching up too, with blended-capital vehicles, aviation fuel price floors and de-risking models for shipping and industrial clusters underway. Together, these moves show how demand signals, enabling policy and innovative finance are converging to shift from pilots to full-scale industrial transformation.

Financing infrastructure

The next bottleneck in the transition is not renewable capacity but the infrastructure that connects and stabilizes it. Modern grids, long-duration storage, resilient ports and digital platforms are the underfunded backbone of the energy transition, requiring $600 billion annually by 2030.

Already, grid congestion in Europe is delaying renewables, while power shortages in the Global South constrain growth and deployment. For investors, these assets combine stable, inflation-protected returns with systemic impact, making infrastructure a portfolio stabilizer and a growth opportunity.

Upgraded grids reduce losses and unlock stranded clean power. Meanwhile, storage smooths volatility and digital platforms optimize utilization, shielding portfolios from disruption. In short, infrastructure is where resilience meets return.

Financing for development

Achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 will require an additional $4 trillion annually, well beyond public budgets. At the once-a-decade International Conference on Financing for Development in Sevilla, leaders reaffirmed their commitment, backing a tripling of multilateral development banks’ lending capacity and greater use of blended finance to mobilize private capital.

For investors, this means expanding opportunities in emerging and developing economies, with development banks and finance institutions absorbing early risks. Development finance is shifting from aid to a platform for scalable, investable growth aligned with climate and sustainability goals.

A message to financial institutions

The next era of finance will be defined less by headlines than by discipline. Across food, nature, industry and infrastructure, investable opportunities are emerging and capital is already flowing. The test is which institutions have the conviction to stay the course.

For financial leaders, this is about shaping markets as much as preserving them. Those that embed sustainability as a core practice, stay steady through political cycles and build the skills, data and partnerships to turn ambition into execution will secure long-term advantage.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_sQ9tVY_2zBxt0EEqVxjOxOVbKRMy-wgf8Kq65NzyEzs.png,N,,2025-09-24 08:56:49.246993

The investment fund was negotiated with the environmental group, Bold Nebraska, which was a leading opponent of construction of the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline across the state.
The agreement has been hailed as a new blueprint for acceptance of large infrastructure projects that impact rural areas.
A year ago, Tallgrass announced its agreement with Bold Nebraska to share some of the proceeds in exchange for its cooperation.
“It’s going to put Nebraska ethanol into a league of its own,” said Steven Davidson, a Tallgrass spokesman.","LINCOLN — A Kansas pipeline company is about to activate its $1.5 billion pipeline to transport carbon dioxide from ethanol plants in Nebraska and Iowa to a sequestration site in Wyoming and, along with it, launch a first-of-its-kind program to share some proceeds with rural communities along the pipeline route.

On Tuesday, officials with Tallgrass Energy said they would soon be shipping CO2 from the first of 11 ethanol plants connected to its pipeline — a converted, former natural gas pipeline — for a 392-mile trip across Nebraska, Colorado, Iowa and Wyoming.

In conjunction with the launch, Tallgrass announced it is making an initial donation of $500,000 to a fund managed by the Nebraska Community Foundation that could financially help more than 230 communities and community organizations on the route.

The company projects that more than $7 million will be distributed over 10 years through the “Trailblazer Community Investment Fund,” with the money targeted for local early childhood centers, elder care facilities and food pantries. That is on top of lease payments to landowners and spending more than $450,000 on disaster response training sessions and equipment purchases for the mostly rural, volunteer fire and rescue departments along the pipeline route.

The investment fund was negotiated with the environmental group, Bold Nebraska, which was a leading opponent of construction of the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline across the state. The agreement has been hailed as a new blueprint for acceptance of large infrastructure projects that impact rural areas.

“It’s important to us to strategically invest back into the communities who have supported the project’s development,” said Kyle Quackenbush, segment president at Tallgrass.

“We hope that these investments serve to provide a safety net to our neighbors throughout their lifetimes – from early childhood to eldercare – so that these communities can continue to grow and thrive,” he said.

A year ago, Tallgrass announced its agreement with Bold Nebraska to share some of the proceeds in exchange for its cooperation.

Such pipelines in other states have generated opposition, as well as lawsuits and protests. In this case, though, extensive new rights of way weren’t necessary, and many landowners along the pipeline route grow corn, a crop expected to benefit from expanding the markets for corn-based ethanol by making the fuel more environmentally friendly.

Jane Kleeb, the founder of Bold Nebraska, said rural communities “deserve to benefit from the projects that impact them – whether that’s sharing in profits, investing in social services or simply having a seat at the project’s decision-making table.”

Kleeb said the agreement serves as a model for rural as well as urban communities impacted by such projects. She added that Tallgrass and Bold recently gave a presentation to officials with the NAACP.

The new pipeline, formerly the Trailblazer pipeline, is the first of its kind to begin operation as part of a push by the Biden Administration to reduce carbon emissions and make ethanol production more “green.” Making the biofuel less carbon-intensive could make it more attractive for states seeking environmental benefits, officials have said, and the pipeline will give Nebraska-produced ethanol an advantage in its use as sustainable aviation fuel, a new market for the biofuel.

“It’s going to put Nebraska ethanol into a league of its own,” said Steven Davidson, a Tallgrass spokesman.

Jeff Yost, president and CEO of Nebraska Community Foundation, said the new fund will target some of the biggest challenges facing rural communities — quality early childhood education, senior care and food insecurity — providing small grants to sustain jobs and services.

He said the foundation has already identified more than 230 organizations in the 31 impacted counties as eligible for a portion of the funds. To share in a portion of the funds, Yost said that qualified organizations will be invited to submit applications and verify that they are doing the work they profess to do.

Yost added that sometimes companies do this kind of fund sharing “for public relations purposes.”

“With the Finnair for Business SAF service, we want to accelerate the adoption of alternative aviation fuel made from renewable raw materials.” In 2024, approximately 0.5% of the aviation fuel procured by Finnair was SAF, with the airline aiming to triple that number this year.
Karppinen said: “The greenhouse gas emissions reduction in sustainable aviation fuel is significant.
But the more we use renewable fuel, the greater the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we will achieve.”","Finnair has launched the Finnair for Business SAF service for corporate customers keen to help reduce aviation emissions and boost the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Available to members of the Finnair for Business program, the new SAF service allows companies to monitor the flight emissions that their business trips generate.

They can then buy SAF environmental attributes – the quantified benefits of using sustainable aviation fuel rather than conventional jet fuel – to help lower the carbon footprint of flying.

Using a book-and-claim model, companies can make an associated claim to the environmental benefit their purchased attributes represent.

This means the actual emission reduction does not necessarily take place on the flight their employees travel on, as the fuel they purchase is not physically loaded into the aircraft.

The achieved reduction in greenhouse gas emissions related to sustainable aviation fuel use is verified by a third party, with the company receiving an audited SAF certificate that can be used for its sustainability reporting.

Tuomo Karppinen, Finnair’s Head of Environment said: “We want to develop flying in a more sustainable direction and are now taking steps on several different fronts.

“We believe that the most effective solutions can be found at the system level and require cooperation not only between decision-makers and energy producers, but also between airlines and customers.

“With the Finnair for Business SAF service, we want to accelerate the adoption of alternative aviation fuel made from renewable raw materials.”

In 2024, approximately 0.5% of the aviation fuel procured by Finnair was SAF, with the airline aiming to triple that number this year.

For example, Finnair collaborates with Neste to accelerate the adoption of SAF.

Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel is made from 100% renewable raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%* over the entire life cycle of the fuel compared to fossil kerosene.

Karppinen said: “The greenhouse gas emissions reduction in sustainable aviation fuel is significant.

“However, the aviation fuel we use will not be fully renewable for a long time, since SAF is blended with fossil fuels. But the more we use renewable fuel, the greater the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we will achieve.”",https://airlinergs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/09/Finnair-A350-Marimekko-Livery-Kivet-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 07:56:47.627967

High-purity CO2 for the food industry as an additional source of income

Prototype for the Flexpower Plus solution from Landmark, Rolls-Royce and ASCO

Rolls-Royce, energy services provider Landmark and carbon dioxide specialist ASCO have teamed up to commission a 10-megawatt gas engine power plant with a carbon capture system in the United Kingdom. Located in Worksop in the East Midlands region, the first tankers carrying purified and liquefied CO2 have already been picked up from the site for use in the food industry to carbonate beverages such as beer and lemonade.

The CO2 is extracted from the exhaust gases of the mtu gas engines - captured by a recovery system - processed, and liquefied. The plant will capture up to 30,000 tons of CO2 per year. The power plant feeds electricity into the grid for around 10,000 households and helps to ensure its stability. The heat produced by the combined heat and power mtu plants will be used both for carbon capture processes and to supply heat to households in the surrounding area.

“Flexible carbon capture gas engine power plants are an important technology for ensuring a stable decentralized energy supply while reducing CO2 emissions” explained Michael Stipa, Senior Vice President Business Development and Product Management Stationary Power Solutions at Rolls-Royce Power Systems. “This plant in Worksop is a great example of the future of sustainable energy and of a successful partnership between technology companies that want to make a difference.”

Rolls-Royce has supplied six highly efficient combined heat and power plants based on mtu Series 4000 L64FNER gas engines for the power plant in Worksop and will ensure the reliable operation of the plant for ten years under a maintenance contract.

ASCO Carbon Dioxide Ltd. is responsible for the carbon capturing and processing plant and ensures the production of high-purity carbon dioxide. The UK-based power generation company Landmark Power Holdings Ltd. has developed and will operate the power plant.

The project is a joint venture with Victory Hill, a specialized investment company for sustainable energy infrastructure.

The Worksop facility is the first project under the FLEXPOWER PLUS™ concept developed by Landmark Power Holdings, which is designed for flexible power generation using mtu gas engines with improved energy efficiency and ASCO CO2 recovery technology. The partnership focuses on the development and distribution of scalable containerized solutions for clean power and heat generation that integrate carbon recovery technologies. With these solutions in line with the Rolls-Royce strategy the company helps its customers to reduce emissions, conserve resources and remain competitive.

“The captured CO2 is an additional source of revenue and a valuable resource for various industries, including food products, synthetic fuels, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), and more,” said Ralph Spring, Managing Director of ASCO Carbon Dioxide Ltd. “Carbon capture is one of the key technologies for the energy transition and will play an even more central role in the coming years as CO2 emission taxes rise, regulatory requirements increase, and mandatory net-zero climate targets come into force.”

The demand came as the aviation trade body published a study demonstrating that sufficient sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock exists to enable the airline industry to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

All feedstocks considered meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use, the report produced in partnership with Worley Consulting claimed.

However, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions to maximise SAF output, Iata noted.

Director general Willie Walsh said: “We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritised then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation.

“There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now.”

North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN nations were identified as key drivers of global SAF output.

Walsh added: “With this study it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonisation.

“The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.

""The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality.”

Iata chief economist and sustainability senior vice president Marie Owens Thomsen said: “The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals.

“Governments, energy producers, investors, and the aviation sector must work together, de-risk investment, and accelerate rollout.

“Policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration are essential to unlock the scale we need. The time to act is now—delays will only make the challenge harder.”",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/334/SAF1_Main.webp,N,,2025-09-24 07:57:05.465249

However, current production is only around two million tonnes a year, compared with an estimated requirement of almost 500 million tonnes by 2050 if the industry is to achieve net zero.

India’s feedstock resources include sugar- and starch-based ethanol, waste oils such as used cooking oil and tallow, agricultural residues, forestry by-products and municipal solid waste.

Together, these could provide around 100 million tonnes of raw material by 2030 and 150 million tonnes by 2050. The study noted that non-food energy crops could further expand this supply.

Agricultural residues are expected to make up the largest share in 2030, accounting for more than 70 per cent of the feedstock potential, followed by forestry residues and waste wood at 16 per cent and municipal waste at about 7 per cent.

IATA said India’s experience with ethanol blending and supportive government policy could position it as a leading producer in the region.

The country is already the world’s third-largest ethanol producer and plans to expand by increasing output from sugarcane juice and starch-rich crops such as maize and cassava.

“And pain is the price of progress.” According to Holyoak, traditional sources of CO2 – ethanol plants, ammonia facilities, and geological domes – still account for more than 75% of the US supply.
“SAF alone could impact the US CO2 market by up to 20%,” Holyoak said.
He suggested the companies “don’t care” about these dynamics right now because the CO2 market is in a relatively steady state.
However, as attendees heard today, there are indicators that 2026 will be tough for the CO2 market.","Up to one-fifth (20%) of the US merchant carbon dioxide supply may be needed to meet growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) demand.

The observation was shared by Jeff Holyoak, Vice-President of Sales and Market Development, at gasworld’s North America CO2 Summit, who described new technologies as “creative destruction.”

Holyoak warned that SAF and emerging carbon utilisation technologies could force industrial gas companies to rethink how they source and allocate CO2, presenting both a major challenge and a strategic opportunity.

“Creative destruction is the market’s way of self-renewing,” he said. “And pain is the price of progress.”

According to Holyoak, traditional sources of CO2 – ethanol plants, ammonia facilities, and geological domes – still account for more than 75% of the US supply.

These sources, he noted, are increasingly vulnerable to disruption, regulatory pressure, and competition from higher-value applications like SAF.

“SAF alone could impact the US CO2 market by up to 20%,” Holyoak said. “And they’ll likely pay a lot more for it than traditional commercial users.”

SAF production is emerging as a major consumer of captured CO2, particularly through power-to-liquid (PtL) pathways and other synthetic fuel processes. These technologies use CO2 as a feedstock to produce low-carbon jet fuel.

While SAF demand is ramping up quickly, Holyoak cautioned that the CO₂ supply chain is lagging dangerously behind, a mismatch that could leave traditional users at risk.

He said that end-users should be early adopters of alternative capture technologies, not just to support innovation, but to protect their own supply chains.

The collaboration leverages DHL’s GoGreen Plus, a service that gives customers the choice to reduce logistics-related greenhouse gas emissions. DHL deploys sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for air transportation, an alternative to traditional jet fuel, which produces fewer CO2e emissions than fossil fuel.

The deal is expected to reduce freight carbon emissions by 24% for DHL Express shipments of Cambridge materials to all international destinations from the UK.

Cambridge University Press & Assessment, which transports over 1,500,000kg of exam-related materials through DHL, had identified freight as a significant source of its greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for around 25% of the organization’s measured emissions. The use of GoGreen Plus is expected to reduce its carbon footprint by around 1,500+ metric tons of CO2e WtW annually.

Guy Nicholson, deputy managing director of global operations at Cambridge University Press & Assessment, said, “We are already taking significant steps to reduce carbon emissions in our supply chain, and overall we have reduced our direct energy-related carbon emissions by 35% since 2019.

“This work with DHL builds on our commitment to environmental responsibility and will support us in achieving our broader carbon reduction targets by significantly reducing our freight emissions.”

Duncan Heron, VP of marketing at DHL Express, added, “Our customers are increasingly focused on reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, and we’re delighted to be able to work with Cambridge University Press & Assessment in their sustainability journey.

“Through GoGreen Plus, we’re providing a powerful tool that enables our clients to cut emissions in their own supply chains. As SAF remains a leading solution for decarbonizing aviation, it’s an effective way for us to help our customers achieve their sustainability goals.”

GoGreen Plus is part of DHL Group’s sustainability commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. It allows customers to bring down their Scope 3 emissions, the indirect greenhouse gas emissions that occur in a company’s value chain, including downstream transportation and distribution.

The service uses the book and claim approach, which enables DHL to directly replace fossil fuels with sustainable fuels within its network and allocate environmental benefits to paying customers, even when their shipments are not physically transported using these fuels.",https://www.parcelandpostaltechnologyinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DHLCUPA-1.jpeg,N,,2025-09-24 07:57:12.059977

The Australian Government has announced a landmark $1.1 billion investment to accelerate the domestic production of low carbon liquid fuels, marking a major step towards cleaner energy and stronger fuel security.

The funding will support the new ten-year Cleaner Fuels Program, designed to stimulate private investment in onshore production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. These “drop-in” fuels are compatible with existing engines and infrastructure, with the first production expected by 2029.

Australia is well-positioned to lead in this space, thanks to it’s abundant feedstocks such as canola, sorghum, sugar, and waste, and access to reliable renewable energy. Currently, liquid fuels account for around half of the nation’s energy use. Replacing fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives presents a significant opportunity to reduce emissions and grow the economy.

The Clean Energy Finance Corporation estimates that a mature Australian low carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050, with the potential to reduce cumulative emissions by 230 million tonnes CO₂-e, equivalent to the annual emissions of 86 million cars.

Funding will be awarded through a competitive process, with eligibility criteria to be shaped by public consultation. The initiative builds on existing government programs including the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.

To further support the industry, the Government is expanding the Guarantee of Origin Scheme to include low carbon liquid fuels and has introduced a fuel quality standard for renewable diesel.

“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals.
The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.
The airline first trialed locally produced SAF on its Incheon-Haneda route from August 2024 to August 2025, successfully verifying the fuel’s safety and performance.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA), in partnership with Worley Consulting, has published a study demonstrating that sufficient sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock exists to enable the airline industry to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. All feedstocks considered meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use. The study also identified significant barriers in using that feedstock for SAF production, namely:

The slow pace of technology rollout that would enable SAF to be produced from varied sources. Currently the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use HEFA technology, for example converting used cooking oil into SAF.

Competition with other potential users of the same feedstock. Policies allocating biomass feedstock to hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation must be prioritised.

Airlines will need 500 million tonnes (Mt) of SAF to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as outlined in the IATA Net Zero Roadmaps. This can be achieved from two main sources:

Biomass: This has the potential to produce more than 300 Mt of bio-SAF annually by 2050. Some of this potential could be limited by use for competing sources. This potential could be expanded by unlocking additional feedstocks or through efficiency gains and technology improvements over intervening decades.

Power-to-liquid (PtL): This will be required to reach 500 Mt of SAF production annually by 2050. Maximizing the volumes of cost-effective bio-SAF will reduce the pressure on e-SAF to bridge the gap.

In all cases, to maximise SAF output, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions.

“We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritised then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation. There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Key findings from the report include:

There are sufficient sustainable feedstocks and SAF production technologies to decarbonize aviation and meet the net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050.

With the right policies and investments, more than 300 Mt of SAF from biomass feedstocks could be produced annually by mid-century and around 200 Mt from e-SAF.

​

The main challenges are:

Enhancing the feedstock supply chain infrastructure, scaling up novel sources that meet sustainability criteria, and ensuring that the feedstocks identified for SAF production are made available to the air transport industry.

Accelerating technology rollout to unlock new SAF production technologies, especially PtL, including reliable access to the low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure which are all required as part of the PtL production method.

Achieving coordinated government policies to support innovation, and investment to create a fully functioning SAF market, unlocking new economic opportunities.

Rallying regional leadership, with North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN identified as key drivers of global SAF output.

Activating the energy industry to invest in SAF production capacity, support technology commercialisation, and align their business strategies with global decarbonisation goals.

“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals. Governments, energy producers, investors, and the aviation sector must work together, de-risk investment, and accelerate rollout. Policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration are essential to unlock the scale we need. The time to act is now—delays will only make the challenge harder,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

“With this study it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonisation. The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector. The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality,” said Walsh.

Korean Air expands use of domestically produced SAF on Japan routes

Korean Air has expanded its use of domestically produced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), introducing a SAF blend on flights to Kobe and Osaka. The airline first trialed locally produced SAF on its Incheon-Haneda route from August 2024 to August 2025, successfully verifying the fuel’s safety and performance. SAF, which can reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, is considered a key component of the aviation industry’s decarbonization strategy. Korean Air will use a 1% SAF blend on flights from Incheon to Kobe (KE731) and Gimpo to Osaka (KE2117) from September 19, 2025 through December 31, 2026. The program will cover approximately 90 flights on the Kobe route and 26 flights on the Osaka route.

The airline’s SAF is sourced from domestic suppliers HD Hyundai Oilbank and GS Caltex. Produced from used cooking oil (UCO), the fuel is certified under the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This initiative reflects Korean Air’s commitment to driving sustainable aviation in Korea and supporting global efforts to achieve carbon neutrality.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/Neste-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 22:56:13.324954

“Having been to 18 COPs myself, I know COP attendees face a dilemma: flight emissions,” said Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and head of SABA Secretariat.
“With the COP30 SAF platform, those travelers now have a way to calculate and decarbonize their flight emissions no matter their point of departure or the aircraft they fly on, while supporting real-world deployment of sustainable aviation fuel.

The COP30 SAF platform empowers conference attendees to calculate and address their aviation-related emissions by supporting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets SABA’s world leading sustainability criteria. In this first of a kind opportunity, the platform is available to all COP30 attendees, including those who are not currently SABA members, as part of a concentrated effort to raise the visibility of SAF and scale funding and adoption of this key climate technology.

“Having been to 18 COPs myself, I know COP attendees face a dilemma: flight emissions,” said Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and head of SABA Secretariat. “With the COP30 SAF platform, those travelers now have a way to calculate and decarbonize their flight emissions no matter their point of departure or the aircraft they fly on, while supporting real-world deployment of sustainable aviation fuel. This is the latest SABA innovation helping connect SAF producers with willing buyers who want to decarbonize their air travel.”

The SAF supported through the new platform is sourced from SkyNRG as the result of a streamlined, competitive procurement process initiated by SABA earlier this year.

“SkyNRG are proud to be the SAF supplier for SABA’s COP30 campaign,” said Theye Veen, chief commercial officer and co-founder of SkyNRG. “We are uniquely positioned as SAF knowledge experts with more than a decade of experience in building supply chains, partnerships, and sustainability standards for high-integrity SAF. We’re pleased to be deepening our collaboration with SABA and we’re excited to help expand SAFc access beyond its membership. The innovative COP30 SAF platform from SABA demonstrates our aligned vision of making SAF more accessible, and in turn, helping the industry to scale.”

SABA’s COP30 initiative is unique because it gives conference goers all the resources they need to decarbonize their COP air travel on a single platform. Attendees first estimate their flight emissions using one of two methods. For commercial flights, travelers will use Google’s Travel Impact Model, an industry-leading calculation tool, while travelers on private jets will use the Eurocontrol Small Emitters tool. Next, attendees purchase a corresponding quantity of high-integrity SAF certificates pre-vetted by SABA; and later receive a retirement statement from the SAFc Registry, which ensures the transaction meets best-in-class chain of custody requirements. The platform supports those traveling via commercial and private aircraft – crucial flexibility given that as many as 65 private jets travel to COP in a given year.

“Not all sustainable aviation fuels are created equal – which is why the SABA SAF platform is such a useful tool for conference attendees wanting to reduce their emissions from travelling to COP30,” said Elizabeth Sturcken, vice president, Net Zero Ambition & Action for Environmental Defense Fund. “For SAF to be high-integrity, it must meet rigorous environmental standards grounded in science. SABA has done the hard work of vetting the best-in-class SAF so buyers can feel confident their purchase will deliver a meaningful climate impact, while sending a clear message to policy makers and the market that high integrity SAF is in demand.”

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a low-carbon alternative to conventional jet fuel, made from renewable or waste-derived feedstocks and offering high scalability and CO2 emissions reduction potential. SAF is what is known as a “drop-in fuel”— meaning it is compatible with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure —and represents the best near-term option to decarbonize air travel. While SAF currently makes up only a small percentage of the total aviation fuels market, SABA’s procurements allow voluntary buyers to support SAF production through investment in sustainable aviation fuel certificates connected with an established, high-integrity book and claim system. Book and claim allows parties to invest in SAF and capture its environmental benefits, even if the fuel does not flow directly into the planes they fly on.

Lawmakers from northern and north-central Wisconsin are circulating a bill supporting Johnson Timber Corp. in Hayward to build a processing plant for aviation fuel made from logging debris to establish a processing plant in Wisconsin.

The legislation would reward the company with a $60 million tax credit and access to $150 million in borrowing through Wisconsin’s bonding authority.

Republican lawmakers wrote in a memo circulated Monday seeking cosponsors that the proposal would create 150 jobs and generate $1.2 billion a year in income after three years of operation.

The processing plant in Hayward would be built by Johnson Timber Corp., in partnership with a German company, Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said at a press conference in the state Capitol Monday morning. The German partner is Synthec Fuels, according to Felzkowski’s office.

Wisconsin along with Michigan and Minnesota are all vying for the project, Felzkowski said, “and the state that helps will be the first state” to get the facility and probably the headquarters for the overall processing operation.

She said the process of converting logging waste into aviation fuel was comparable to how corn is grown for and converted into ethanol.

“We will be taking that wood product and turning it into a carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation,” Felzkowski said.

As drafted, the bill would authorize the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. (WEDC) to create a manufacturing zone for aviation biofuel derived from wood matter and to issue up to $60 million in tax credits for a business operating in the zone.

The bill requires the business to source 80% or more of the wood used from Wisconsin and invest at least $1.5 billion in the project.

The bill also provides for the business to borrow up to $150 million for the project using Wisconsin’s tax-free bonding authority.

At the press conference, lawmakers, Sawyer County officials and a timber industry representative billed legislation as a “forestry revitalization” measure.

Paper and pulp plants in Wisconsin Rapids, Park Falls and Duluth, Minnesota, have all gone out of business in the last five years, accounting for about 30% of the pulp produced by Wisconsin’s timber industry, said Henry Sheinebeck, executive director of the Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association.

“We’re growing at a minimum two times more [timber] than we’re harvesting,” Sheinebeck said. Enabling the timber industry to cut down and make use of more trees would preserve and improve the health of forests in the state, he said.

The association and the paper industry are the joint recipients of an unrelated $1 million grant in the state 2025-27 budget to draw up a statewide forestry industry strategic plan.",,N,,2025-09-23 22:56:35.730707

The research contradicts previous concerns about feedstock availability limiting SAF production, instead identifying the technology commercialization process as the critical constraint.
Most SAF production pathways beyond HEFA remain at technology readiness levels below full commercial deployment.
While sufficient raw materials exist to fuel a decarbonized aviation sector, realizing this potential depends critically on accelerating the pace of technology development and commercial deployment across multiple SAF production pathways.","The aviation industry possesses adequate sustainable feedstock resources to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but faces critical delays in deploying the production technologies needed to convert these materials into usable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), according to a comprehensive study released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) on Monday.

The research, conducted in partnership with Worley Consulting, reveals that while sufficient biomass and alternative feedstocks exist globally, the slow pace of technology commercialization represents the primary bottleneck preventing airlines from meeting their decarbonization commitments.

Airlines will require approximately 500 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2050 to achieve net-zero emissions, a massive scale-up from current global production of just 2 million tonnes in 2025. The study demonstrates this target could theoretically be met through available feedstock sources, but only if production technologies advance rapidly from their current developmental stages.

Willie Walsh, IATA Director General, emphasized the urgency of accelerating industrial deployment. The aviation industry has committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with SAF expected to contribute roughly 65% of the required emissions reductions.

Current SAF production relies almost entirely on Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, which processes used cooking oil and similar feedstocks. However, meeting 2050 targets will require diversifying into multiple production pathways including power-to-liquid processes that convert captured carbon dioxide and hydrogen into synthetic fuels.

The study identifies biomass potential exceeding 12,000 million tonnes by 2050, though competing uses in other sectors reduce availability for SAF production to approximately 1,580 million tonnes. This quantity could support production of over 300 million tonnes of bio-based SAF annually, requiring power-to-liquid technologies to bridge the remaining gap.

Regional analysis highlights North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries as critical drivers of global SAF output. These regions possess the feedstock resources, refining infrastructure, and policy frameworks necessary to enable large-scale production.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist, stressed that policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration remain essential to unlocking the required scale of investment. The report emphasizes that delays in technology deployment will only make the decarbonization challenge more difficult.

Power-to-liquid pathways face particular hurdles, requiring massive expansion of renewable electricity capacity and carbon capture infrastructure. The study estimates that global renewable power generation would need to nearly double to produce up to 200 million tonnes of synthetic SAF by 2050.

Competition for sustainable feedstocks presents another challenge, with other hard-to-abate sectors including shipping and heavy industry also requiring biomass resources for their own decarbonization efforts. Strategic allocation policies prioritizing aviation’s unique fuel requirements will be essential.

The research contradicts previous concerns about feedstock availability limiting SAF production, instead identifying the technology commercialization process as the critical constraint. Most SAF production pathways beyond HEFA remain at technology readiness levels below full commercial deployment.

Investment requirements for the necessary production infrastructure are substantial. Previous IATA analysis indicates that between 3,000 and 6,500 new renewable fuel plants will be needed globally to meet aviation’s 2050 targets, requiring significant annual capital expenditures over the next three decades.

The study’s findings arrive as various governments implement SAF mandates and incentive programs. Europe’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and similar policies in other regions aim to create demand certainty for producers, though the research suggests supply-side constraints may prove more limiting than previously anticipated.

For airlines committed to net-zero emissions, the study underscores both opportunity and urgency.

Five years ago, the Verso paper mill in Wisconsin Rapids shut down. That plant was a major consumer of pulpwood, and its closure left a “big hole” in Wisconsin’s pulpwood market, said state Senate President Mary Felzkowski, R-Tomahawk, who’s among the sponsors of legislation announced Monday.

The legislation began circulating for cosponsors Monday. State Rep. Chanz Green, R-Grand View, was listed as lead sponsor, along with more than half a dozen other Republicans.

Starting this year, airports within the European Union must use at least 2% of what’s known as sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, within their fuel mix. The EU is set to increase its mandated SAF percentages in coming years. The United States does not currently impose such requirements.

SAF is an alternative to fossil fuel, and the goal of those requirements is to cut back on carbon emissions. SAF can include biofuels, such as energy made from pulped wood.

“There is going to be an increasing demand for this type of fuel, and we are right at the forefront here in Wisconsin,” Felzkowski said during a Monday morning news conference at the state Capitol.

A German company called Synthec Fuels is looking to run the plant in partnership with Wisconsin-based Johnson Timber, sponsors of the legislation said.

Synthec Fuels is also considering other locations in Minnesota or Michigan, Felzkowski said.

She suggested that the proposed tax incentives could help seal the deal for Wisconsin.

“There’s three states vying for this” Felzkowski said. “The state that helps will be the first state there, and they will also have the headquarters.”

The newly announced legislation would set aside $60 million in tax credits from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation for the project. Wisconsin would also give out a $150 million grant to help create the plant. That grant would be backed by public borrowing through the Wisconsin Department of National Resources’ forestry account.

In exchange, the company creating the plant would agree to invest at least $1.5 billion into the project over the first five years. And at least 80% of the wood that would be processed at the plant would need to come from Wisconsin forests over that same five-year period.

The facility is expected to create 150 jobs, legislative sponsors said. Those roles would help revitalize a local economy that’s been hit hard by a declining market for paper producers, said Mike Markgren, the county administrator in Sawyer County.

“Logging fell on hard times after the paper mills began to close,” Markgren said. “Demand decreased, prices flattened and we suffered.”

Markgren said Sawyer County’s economy has been increasingly centered on tourism.

“Those hospitality jobs pay on average $37,000 annually, and that is likely with no benefits, so that is not a sustainable wage,” Markgren said.

In contrast, he hopes a new wood pulp factory will bring more “well-paying jobs with full benefits,” to the region.

“Anything that can be done to strengthen the diversification of industry in Sawyer County is very welcome,” Markgren said.

Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of Wisconsin lawmakers introduced separate bills that would create a $1.50 per gallon tax credit for Sustainable Aviation Fuel producers.

Why it matters: Resource conservation can convert waste into value, helping industries cut emissions and reach sustainability goals.

Axios' Amy Harder, Ben Geman and Chuck McCutcheon hosted conversations with Delta Air Lines chief sustainability officer Amelia DeLuca, World Resources Institute president and CEO Ani Dasgupta, and McLaren Racing sustainability director Kim Wilson. The event was sponsored by Suntory Global Spirits.

Today, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is derived from soy and other crops, but DeLuca said future sources could include materials such as corn or wood waste. She stressed SAF's ""value chain approach,"" which affects corporations, farmers and rural communities.

""You've got a whole rural community that's like, 'I actually don't know where my future is,'"" DeLuca said. ""Sustainable aviation fuel, it's not just a blip. It's not a five-year thing. This is a multiple-decades' worth of a product that we're going to need as an industry that also helps those communities, and that's again where you have that win, win, win.""

Meanwhile, Wilson noted that McLaren Racing pioneered the use of recycled carbon fiber in the racing industry, which can reduce emissions by up to 90%.

After discovering that materials accounted for a significant portion of its footprint, McLaren Racing worked with a supplier to recycle aerospace waste.

""The thing about new materials is you have to think about how do we not compromise between on-track performance … for sustainability, but we also need to find ways to balance that and innovate,"" Wilson said.

McLaren Racing has already used recycled carbon fiber for non-safety-critical parts in Austin and Silverstone and is exploring what's next.

Separately, Dasgupta said technology is transforming the clean energy transition ""at a scale and speed and price that we didn't even think possible.""

However, Dasgupta noted that ""technology itself doesn't produce good outcomes. We need to orchestrate that outcome."" He said collaboration across industries and tech innovators is needed to help ensure a smooth transition.

Forming part of Eni's broader decarbonization strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 in line with the global energy transition, the projects collectively seek to increase Enilive’s current 1.65-million tpy systemwide biorefining capacity to more than 5 million tpy—2 million tpy of which could be SAF—by 2030.

The first global operator to convert two of its conventional refineries into biorefinerie, Eni first began producing biofuels in 2014 by processing vegetable oils and biomass waste into renewable diesel following conversion of the Venice refinery, followed by transformation of the 105,000-b/d Gela refinery on the southern coast of Sicily in 2019.

In addition to the Sannazzaro conversion project, Eni is also progressing on Italy’s northwestern coast with the planned conversion of the idled 84,000-b/d conventional refinery in Livorno, Tuscany, into what will become Italy’s third biorefinery.

Targeted for startup in 2026 with a nameplate production capacity of 500,000 tpy, the Livorno plant will be followed by Eni subsidiary Versalis SPA’s conversion of the Priolo Gargallo steam-cracking plant in eastern Sicily by yearend 2028 into a biorefinery with a nameplate production capacity of 500,000 tpy.","https://img.ogj.com/files/base/ebm/ogj/image/2025/09/68d2e7df696209131e908ae0-250923eni_spa_sannazzaro_refinery.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-09-23 15:56:53.137825

Key findings from the report include that there are sufficient sustainable feedstocks and SAF production technologies to decarbonise aviation and meet the net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050.
“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals.
The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.","MUMBAI: A new study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has concluded that the airline industry has access to sufficient sustainable feedstock to achieve its net-zero emissions goal by 2050. The study, however, identifies a significant bottleneck in the slow rollout of technology needed to convert these diverse feedstocks into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a challenge exacerbated by competition from other sectors for the same raw materials. The study done in partnership with Worley Consulting said that all feedstocks considered meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use."" The study also identified significant barriers in using that feedstock for SAF production, namely the slow pace of technology rollout that would enable SAF to be produced from varied sources. Currently, the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use HEFA technology, for example, converting used cooking oil into SAF. There is also competition with other potential users of the same feedstock. Policies allocating biomass feedstock to hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation must be prioritised,"" said IATA in a press statement issued on Tuesday. Airlines will need 500 million tonnes (Mt) of SAF to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as outlined in the IATA Net Zero Roadmaps. This can be achieved from two main sources: Biomass, which has the potential to produce more than 300 Mt of bio-SAF annually by 2050. ""Some of this potential could be limited by use for competing sources. This potential could be expanded by unlocking additional feedstocks or through efficiency gains and technology improvements over intervening decades. Power-to-liquid (PtL) will be required to reach 500 Mt of SAF production annually by 2050. Maximising the volumes of cost-effective bio-SAF will reduce the pressure on e-SAF to bridge the gap,"" it said. In all cases, to maximise SAF output, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions, said IATA. “We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritised then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation. There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. Key findings from the report include that there are sufficient sustainable feedstocks and SAF production technologies to decarbonise aviation and meet the net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050. With the right policies and investments, more than 300 Mt of SAF from biomass feedstocks could be produced annually by mid-century and around 200 Mt from e-SAF. ""The main challenges are enhancing the feedstock supply chain infrastructure, scaling up novel sources that meet sustainability criteria, and ensuring that the feedstocks identified for SAF production are made available to the air transport industry. Accelerating technology rollout to unlock new SAF production technologies, especially PtL (power-to-liquid), including reliable access to the low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure which are all required as part of the PtL production method. Achieving coordinated govt policies to support innovation, and investment to create a fully functioning SAF market, unlocking new economic opportunities. Rallying regional leadership, with North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN identified as key drivers of global SAF output. Activating the energy industry to invest in SAF production capacity, support technology commercialisation, and align their business strategies with global decarbonisation goals,"" said IATA. “The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals. Govts, energy producers, investors, and the aviation sector must work together, de-risk investment, and accelerate rollout. Policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration are essential to unlock the scale we need. The time to act is now—delays will only make the challenge harder,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist. “With this study, it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonisation. The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector. The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality,” said Walsh.

A recent study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has highlighted a significant opportunity for the aviation industry to meet its decarbonization goals through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This technological shift has the potential to reshape tourism and travel experiences, contributing to a more sustainable and eco-friendly future for global travel. As the demand for aviation tourism grows, the IATA study underscores the importance of accelerating SAF technology to ensure that the aviation sector becomes a leader in sustainable travel.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: The Game Changer for Tourism

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is considered the most promising solution for reducing aviation’s carbon emissions. SAF is produced from renewable sources like biomass and waste, offering a reduction in carbon emissions by up to 80% when compared to traditional jet fuel. The aviation tourism industry, which plays a pivotal role in global tourism, is poised to benefit from this breakthrough technology. As airlines adopt SAF, tourists will experience a greener, more sustainable form of travel.

The use of SAF will help preserve the environment while enabling the tourism industry to grow, attracting eco-conscious travelers. This can foster growth in sustainable tourism, particularly in destinations known for their natural beauty, such as the Amazon rainforest, Alaska, and the Caribbean. Travelers are increasingly looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint, and by offering more sustainable travel options, the aviation sector can appeal to this growing market.

The Challenges in Scaling SAF Technology

Despite its potential, SAF technology is still in its early stages of development, creating a bottleneck for the aviation sector. The IATA study indicates that the real challenge lies not in the availability of feedstocks but in the slow pace at which SAF production technologies are being scaled. While feedstocks such as used cooking oil are available in sufficient quantities, the technology to produce SAF at scale remains underdeveloped. This delay is crucial for the aviation tourism sector, as without a reliable and consistent supply of SAF, airlines may struggle to meet their sustainability goals.

The slow pace of SAF technology development means that tourists may face delays in the transition to greener aviation. Airlines that fail to adopt SAF may find themselves at a disadvantage as eco-conscious travelers seek airlines that offer sustainable travel options. Therefore, there is an urgent need for investment in SAF technology to accelerate its deployment, enabling airlines to offer sustainable tourism options and stay competitive in the market.

The Role of Policy and Investment in Tourism

To facilitate the rapid development and adoption of SAF, the IATA study stresses the importance of coordinated government policies and investment in SAF infrastructure. Governments play a crucial role in de-risking investments in SAF production by providing financial incentives, regulatory support, and long-term policy clarity. For aviation tourism, this means ensuring that airports and airlines have access to the necessary infrastructure to support SAF production and distribution.

Governments, especially in regions with high tourist traffic, need to offer financial incentives for airlines that adopt SAF technology. By doing so, they will ensure that tourism remains a sustainable industry, attracting eco-conscious travelers who are increasingly concerned with their environmental impact. A coordinated policy framework will foster the growth of SAF technology, benefiting both the aviation industry and the tourism sector as a whole.

A Sustainable Future for Aviation Tourism

The future of aviation tourism relies heavily on the successful implementation of SAF and other green technologies in the aviation sector. According to IATA, the industry will need approximately 500 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2050 to reach net-zero emissions. This presents a significant opportunity for the tourism sector, as more tourists will choose destinations with sustainable travel options.

As airlines and governments collaborate to make SAF widely available, aviation tourism will see a rise in demand for more sustainable travel options. Destinations that prioritize sustainability in their tourism offerings will attract a new generation of eco-conscious travelers, driving the growth of sustainable tourism.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-SAF-technology-aviation-tourism-net-zero-emissions-IATA-environmental-impact-aviation-decarbonization.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 13:56:30.496531

Recent research, including a study by Opoku (2024), shows the complex connection between the built environment and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which focus on five key areas: People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnerships.There are still gaps in understanding of how construction and facilities management (FM) can effectively support the goals related to Planet, Prosperity, and Partnership. Closing these gaps is important for creating better solutions based on life cycle assessments. By using sustainable construction and FM practices, we can reduce energy, water, and waste throughout the entire life cycle, from building to maintenance and operation. Collins et al. (2019) studied the divide between sustainable buildings and FM. They emphasized the need to unite design, construction, and FM. FM is now focusing more on sustainability by including the United Nations SDGs in their decision-making processes (Lok et al., 2023). Recent studies from IFMEC (2018) and Klungseth et al. (2022, 2023) show that using technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) in FM can help achieve SDG 9, which is about industry, innovation, and infrastructure. Opoku and Lee (2022) note that FM is moving towards a long-term view that considers the social, environmental, and economic impacts of business decisions. To contribute to the UN SDGs, we need more research to explore the full potential and limitations of these technologies and strategies in meeting broader sustainability goals. This research topic invited studies on construction and facilities in the built environment to the UN SDGs. We aim to explore how sustainable practices improve environmental, economic, and social outcomes while assessing the effectiveness of current standards and technologies. This requires collaboration with key stakeholders to create strategies that enhance health, safety, and well-being. A comprehensive plan should align investments, management, design, construction, operations, and services. Those sectors are focusing on long-term strategies, such as better practices, using digital technology, building partnerships, and following international standards. In our topic we feature three types of contributions: conceptual, empirical, and review. This topic includes eight international publications, comprising three Community Case Studies, two Literature Reviews, and three Original Research Papers. 1.

Agentic AI is the leap from automation to autonomy: a system that rebooks, reroutes, and reallocates without waiting for human input. It is the difference between reacting to delays and preventing them. For an industry under pressure to deliver efficiency, resilience, and sustainability at once, this is the moment to turn intelligence into action.

Today, most airlines manage operational and sustainability data separately. Flight metrics such as fuel burn and load factors are tracked in real-time, while carbon reporting is generally required annually. This delay creates blind spots that make compliance harder and slow progress.

DataArt bridges this divide. With Agentic AI and the AI Lake Accelerator (AILA), airlines unify fragmented data, moving from retrospective reports to real-time action:

Agentic AI moves beyond rule-based automation, proactively supporting goal-driven decisions while keeping humans in control.

AILA provides the data foundation: a cloud-native environment that unifies operational and environmental data into one reliable source.

Together, they help airlines progress in three areas: sustainability, commercial performance, and operational efficiency.

Sustainability: From reports to real-rime action

Under ICAO’s CORSIA framework, international airlines must report and offset emissions starting in 2027. Many carriers invest in newer fleets, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and waste reduction. Yet SAF use remains low, accounting for less than 0.3% of total aviation fuel in 2024. Emissions tracking, meanwhile, remains fragmented and retrospective.

Real-time data changes this. One regional carrier found that 12% of its emissions came not from flying but from delays at the gate. Linking ground operations data into emissions dashboards cut turnaround fuel burn and improved punctuality.

Agentic AI goes further: forecasting contrail formation, suggesting taxi routes that minimise fuel burn, or reallocating resources to prevent delays. These steps cut carbon and cost at once.

DataArt’s experience in other sectors shows the value of real-time optimisation. A smart city platform aggregated air quality data from multiple sources and adjusted commuter routes to reduce exposure. The same principle applies in aviation: with AI, similar results to traditional optimisation methods can be achieved in a fraction of the time, dynamically optimising routes based on real-time information the AI agent receives.

Commercial growth: Personalisation meets responsibility

Aviation’s profitability hinges on ancillary revenue, loyalty programs, and differentiated experiences. At the same time, younger travellers increasingly choose carriers demonstrating climate responsibility.

Agentic AI acts as an information broker across fragmented commercial systems. By unifying reservation, sales, and loyalty data, it enables:

Dynamic pricing that factors in both demand and route-level carbon intensity.

Sustainability-linked rewards, such as extra points for booking SAF-backed flights.

Real-time service recovery, providing tailored compensation or rebooking while prioritising lower-emission alternatives, such as offering SAF-backed flights or more efficient connections.

Airlines like KLM, Lufthansa, and Virgin Atlantic highlight sustainability as a differentiator in CEO messaging. Yet without integrated data, these remain ambitions, rather than outcomes. Embedding environmental signals into loyalty and sales programs helps airlines align revenue with climate goals while building trust.

Similar approaches have proven effective outside aviation. DataArt built a chatbot for a sustainability information provider that turned unstructured data into structured supply chain models. It tripled the speed of analysis, enabling better commercial decisions. Airlines can adopt similar approaches to transform fragmented loyalty and reservations data into actionable insights.

Operational efficiency: Smarter, leaner, greener

Delays increase fuel burn, crew overtime, and compensation costs, which Eurocontrol estimates to be several billion euros. In Europe, nearly one in four scheduled flights runs late.

Many airlines still depend on manual data entry and siloed IT systems, slow information flow fragments situational awareness, leading to reactive decisions.

Agentic AI can help. By analysing data across operations control, ground handling, and flight crews, it identifies disruption risks and suggests timely interventions. Airlines emphasise that AI should support, not replace, human decision-makers by accelerating awareness, forecasting disruption impacts, and reducing information overload.

Consider an airport that integrated building management data into a central sustainability lake. Predictive forecasting cuts emissions and energy costs. The same logic applies to aircraft turnaround and crew scheduling: efficiency and sustainability reinforce each other.

Why now?

Three forces make this shift urgent:

Regulation is accelerating. CORSIA, the EU’s CSRD, and IFRS frameworks demand verifiable, near real-time reporting.

Stakeholder expectations are rising. Investors, regulators, and passengers want measurable progress, not aspirational targets.

Technology has matured. With accelerators like AILA, even mid-sized carriers can deploy integrated data lakes in weeks, not years.

From intention to impact

Agentic AI and AILA are not silver bullets. Success requires cultural change, integration with legacy systems, and human-AI collaboration. But the payoff is clear:

Credible sustainability progress is traceable to source data.

Commercial strategies that reflect climate responsibility.

Resilient operations that cut cost and carbon together.

By 2030, airlines that embed AI into daily operations will pull decisively ahead of those that do not. The leaders of the next decade will treat sustainability as a live operational discipline, not a side report.

At the World Aviation Festival 2025, on October 7, DataArt experts will share how Agentic AI and AILA help carriers turn sustainability ambition into operational impact. With over 25 years of engineering experience and a culture of radical respect, DataArt partners with airlines, airports, MROs, and service providers to build advanced, resilient solutions tailored to aviation realities.

The time to act is now on every route, flight, and decision.

They will be able to monitor emissions from business trips and co-fund the use of alternative fuels, which are known in the aviation industry as “sustainable” aviation fuel (SAF).
Book-and-claim is becoming a more common way for corporates to contribute to the cost of alternative fuels and reduce their emissions from flights.
The airline last month announced that it would take part in a new production pilot programme aimed at producing a “synthetic” type of alternative aviation fuel.
Finnair added that around 31,000 individual customers have contributed a “small amount” to promoting the use of alternative fuels since the option was made available a year ago.","Finnair is launching a new service for corporate customers allowing them to support the use of alternative aviation fuels.

The carrier said the new scheme has been designed for members of its Finnair for Business programme. They will be able to monitor emissions from business trips and co-fund the use of alternative fuels, which are known in the aviation industry as “sustainable” aviation fuel (SAF).

Finnair explained that emissions reductions through using alternative fuels will be verified by a third party; the client will receive an audited SAF certificate for their investment, which can be used as part of their sustainability reporting.

The scheme will use the “book-and-claim” system, which allows corporates to claim the reduction in emissions without the alternative fuel having to be physically used on flights taken by the organisation’s travellers.

Tuomo Karppinen, Finnair's head of environment, said: “We believe that the most effective solutions can be found at the system level and require co-operation not only between decision-makers and energy producers, but also between airlines and customers.

“With Finnair for Business SAF service, we want to accelerate the adoption of alternative aviation fuel made from renewable raw materials.”

Using alternative fuels can reduce the emissions from aviation by up to 80 per cent over the lifecycle of the fuels compared with traditional kerosene. The fuels are produced from feedstocks such as used cooking oil, animal fat and agricultural residues.

Book-and-claim is becoming a more common way for corporates to contribute to the cost of alternative fuels and reduce their emissions from flights.

Specialist fuel producer Neste launched a book-and-claim platform last year, while leading TMC American Express Global Business Travel created its own Avelia book-and-claim system in 2022 in partnership with Shell Aviation and Accenture.

Alternative fuels only accounted for 0.5 per cent of Finnair’s total fuel procurement in 2024 but this percentage is set to “roughly treble” this year, according to the airline. The EU is now requiring airlines to use at least 2 per cent SAF in their fuel mix from this year.

The airline last month announced that it would take part in a new production pilot programme aimed at producing a “synthetic” type of alternative aviation fuel.

We have partnered with ABB, Fortum, and Finavia to produce eSAF, which gives us a huge advantage as an alternative or an extra to SAF,” Kirchner explained .
Beyond fuel: operational innovation While SAF dominates the long-term decarbonisation debate, Kirchner also drew attention to practical measures Finnair Cargo has already implemented in its operations.
In cargo operations, even waste streams are being redirected: unsellable fish from its Helsinki cool hub are now donated to the Helsinki Zoo as animal feed .
“Rome wasn’t built in a day – and neither will aviation sustainability,” she remarked .","At the Caspian Air Cargo Summit 2025, Anna-Maria Kirchner, Head of Global Sales at Finnair Cargo, outlined how the Nordic carrier is tackling the sustainability challenge, with a sharp focus on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as the most impactful tool available to the sector today.

Net-zero depends on SAF

Kirchner pointed out that aviation’s path to net-zero by 2050 is inseparable from SAF adoption. “If we continue with our net zero goals for 2050, IATA has calculated that we will need 65 percent of SAF to be fuelled on the aircraft,” she said .

Despite this, progress remains limited. In 2024, just 1.3 million litres of SAF were purchased by airlines in the EU – amounting to a mere 0.3 percent of global consumption . With the EU now mandating a 2% SAF blend, Kirchner stressed that scaling production and uptake is critical to ensuring that airlines can meet their climate commitments.

Finnair estimates that 75 percent of its net-zero pathway will rely on SAF and emerging alternatives such as electrofuels, with the balance coming from new technologies like electric and hydrogen flight once they become commercially viable .

Pioneering new fuels with Liquid Sun

In August 2025, Finnair took a step beyond conventional SAF with a partnership on Liquid Sun, an electrofuel project that uses solar power to split water into hydrogen, which is then converted into renewable fuel.

“Part of the Finnair strategy is preparing for an energy transformation. We have partnered with ABB, Fortum, and Finavia to produce eSAF, which gives us a huge advantage as an alternative or an extra to SAF,” Kirchner explained .

Although still at an early stage, she highlighted that every incremental step matters. “This has just started now in August. It will be little what we get out of it, but we always say every step counts in the journey of sustainability,” she said .

Beyond fuel: operational innovation

While SAF dominates the long-term decarbonisation debate, Kirchner also drew attention to practical measures Finnair Cargo has already implemented in its operations.

Trials are underway using lightweight cardboard pallets, developed by Finnish company Atte, which are 50–100kg lighter than traditional wooden pallets. These provide lower emissions, reduced costs, and reusability on long-haul flights such as those to Seoul .

In line with Finland’s circular economy principles, Finnair has also developed a recycling programme for uniforms, turning old garments into new textiles. In cargo operations, even waste streams are being redirected: unsellable fish from its Helsinki cool hub are now donated to the Helsinki Zoo as animal feed .

Terminals powered by the sun

Another notable step is the installation of 2,990 solar panels at Finnair Cargo’s state-of-the-art hub in Helsinki, opened in 2018. These panels generate 37 percent of the facility’s annual electricity needs, with surplus power fed into catering operations and airport offices during the long days of Finland’s summer .

Kirchner said that while these efforts may seem modest compared to the scale of aviation’s climate challenge, they demonstrate how incremental action adds up. “Rome wasn’t built in a day – and neither will aviation sustainability,” she remarked .

Education and collaboration

Kirchner stressed that collaboration across the aviation value chain is vital, particularly when it comes to standardising emissions reporting and SAF claims. Finnair has partnered with Neste, also headquartered in Finland and one of the world’s leading SAF producers, to create education programmes for forwarders and shippers.

“We hear a lot about reporting. How are the emissions being calculated? What is a booking claim process? How can shippers, how can forwarders, how can we do this together? The most important journey for us is our future, but also how we collaborate with partners in the industry,” she said .

For Kirchner, the most important message is credibility: the industry must “walk the talk.” By investing in SAF, testing new fuels, and embedding circular economy thinking into daily cargo operations, Finnair Cargo is positioning itself as a frontrunner in aviation sustainability.

“Most important is to think about what else we can do to make sure that the planet we’re living in will also be something with a 2050 net-zero target achieved,” she concluded .",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-23-at-16.41.05.png,N,,2025-09-23 10:56:12.309648

Currently the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use HEFA technology, for example converting used cooking oil into SAF.
“We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritized then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonization.
“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals.
The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.","Geneva - The International Air Transport Association (IATA), in partnership with Worley Consulting, has published a study demonstrating that sufficient sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock exists to enable the airline industry to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. All feedstocks considered meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use.

The study also identified significant barriers in using that feedstock for SAF production, namely:

The slow pace of technology rollout that would enable SAF to be produced from varied sources. Currently the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use HEFA technology, for example converting used cooking oil into SAF.

Competition with other potential users of the same feedstock. Policies allocating biomass feedstock to hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation must be prioritized.

Airlines will need 500 million tonnes (Mt) of SAF to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as outlined in the IATA Net Zero Roadmaps. This can be achieved from two main sources:

Biomass: This has the potential to produce more than 300 Mt of bio-SAF annually by 2050. Some of this potential could be limited by use for competing sources. This potential could be expanded by unlocking additional feedstocks or through efficiency gains and technology improvements over intervening decades.

Power-to-liquid (PtL): This will be required to reach 500 Mt of SAF production annually by 2050. Maximizing the volumes of cost-effective bio-SAF will reduce the pressure on e-SAF to bridge the gap.

In all cases, to maximize SAF output, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions.

“We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritized then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonization. There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Key findings from the report include:

There are sufficient sustainable feedstocks and SAF production technologies to decarbonize aviation and meet the net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050.

With the right policies and investments, more than 300 Mt of SAF from biomass feedstocks could be produced annually by mid-century and around 200 Mt from e-SAF.

The main challenges are:

Enhancing the feedstock supply chain infrastructure, scaling up novel sources that meet sustainability criteria, and ensuring that the feedstocks identified for SAF production are made available to the air transport industry.

Accelerating technology rollout to unlock new SAF production technologies, especially PtL, including reliable access to the low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure which are all required as part of the PtL production method.

Achieving coordinated government policies to support innovation, and investment to create a fully functioning SAF market, unlocking new economic opportunities.

Rallying regional leadership, with North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN identified as key drivers of global SAF output.

Activating the energy industry to invest in SAF production capacity, support technology commercialization, and align their business strategies with global decarbonization goals.

“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals. Governments, energy producers, investors, and the aviation sector must work together, de-risk investment, and accelerate rollout. Policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration are essential to unlock the scale we need. The time to act is now—delays will only make the challenge harder,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

“With this study it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonization. The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector. The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality,” said Walsh.

Munich-based VÆRIDION and Deutsche Aircraft have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to collaborate on flight testing and technology development. The two will combine their expertise in electric propulsion, aircraft design, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

As part of the agreement, VÆRIDION’s advanced battery technology will be tested on the D328 UpLift flying test bed, operated by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR). Deutsche Aircraft will contribute its experience in structural engineering, industrialisation, and testing processes to support the development of VÆRIDION’s Microliner, a nine-seat commuter aircraft.

Microliner and D328eco: two pathways to cleaner aviation

VÆRIDION is pursuing a fully battery-electric solution with its Microliner. The 100% electric aircraft is designed for short-haul routes of up to 400 kilometres, and features modular wing-integrated batteries and a glider-inspired design. The company aims to provide affordable, zero-emission connectivity for underserved regional markets.

Deutsche Aircraft is developing the D328eco, a 40-seat regional aircraft designed to operate on 100% sustainable aviation fuel. The aircraft is a next-generation successor to the Dornier 328, and leverages the OEM’s system integration capabilities as Germany’s only certified aircraft manufacturer.

The company has been steadily moving the programme forward, including the rollout of its first D328eco test aircraft (TAC-1) earlier this year, and the integration of Garmin’s G5000 Prime flight deck into the turboprop.

Advancing emission-free regional flights

“This MoU marks a pivotal moment in our journey toward emission-free regional flights,” said Markus Kochs-Kämper, CTO and Managing Director of VÆRIDION. “By uniting our technological expertise with Deutsche Aircraft’s long-standing engineering excellence and design quality, we aim to accelerate the Microliner programme and provide sustainable, cost-effective air travel solutions to underserved markets in Europe and beyond.”

Frederic Fischer, Head of R&T at Deutsche Aircraft, stated that the partnership underscores the increasing significance of collaborative innovation. “We are proud to collaborate with VÆRIDION in shaping the future of regional aviation. This partnership reflects our shared commitment to innovation, sustainability, and the transformation of air mobility,” he said.

Bavaria as a hub for innovation in green aviation

This MoU also reflects a regional strategy for accelerating European clean aviation goals by leveraging collaboration and shared expertise in Bavaria’s aerospace cluster.

Both companies are based near Munich and maintain a presence at the AirTech Campus in Oberpfaffenhofen, a cluster of aerospace activity that includes startups, research institutes, and established players.

Their work also aligns with Deutsche Aircraft’s industrial ramp-up plans, including the construction of its new final assembly line at Leipzig Airport, developed in partnership with Weerts Group.

The facility will eventually produce up to 48 aircraft per year. However, the programme has faced headwinds, with the entry into service of the D328eco delayed to Q4 2027 due to certification and design integration challenges.

A focus on decarbonising regional flights

By collaborating, VÆRIDION and Deutsche Aircraft can cover a wide range of regional aviation needs. Battery-electric designs, such as the Microliner, promise zero-emission operations but face challenges related to weight, charging infrastructure, and limited range.

SAF-powered aircraft, such as the D328eco, offer more immediate reductions in lifecycle emissions while remaining compatible with existing airport infrastructure and supporting longer-range operations.

The collaboration comes amid increasing efforts to decarbonise regional aviation. Startups like Heart Aerospace, with its hybrid-electric ES-30, and MAEVE, with its Maeve Jet, have also set their sights on the commuter and regional markets with new propulsion concepts.

Regional aircraft manufacturers ATR and Embraer are also pursuing hybrid and SAF-based solutions.

All these projects acknowledge that multiple technologies will be required to achieve net-zero aviation by 2050.

The work between VÆRIDION and Deutsche Aircraft could accelerate certification, testing, and industrialisation timelines. Together, they could bring both battery-electric and SAF-powered next-generation aircraft into service before the end of the decade.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deutsche-Aircraft-D328eco-UpLift-flying-test-bed.jpeg,N,,2025-09-23 09:56:35.878237

“If we can keep that going along with sustainable aviation fuel for the future, I think this is a win-win.” The plant would take low quality wood and convert it to aviation biofuel.
The legislation introduced Monday would authorize the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation to create an aviation biofuel tax credit of $60 million as an Enterprise Zone Tax Credit.
“The state that helps will be the first state there, and they will also have the headquarters then located at that,” she said.","Wisconsin’s Forestry Industry is a $42-billion industry providing more than 126,000 jobs, many in the northern portion of state.

But, as WXPR has previously reported, the industry also faces many challenges.

Disease, pests, climate change, and loss of mills are a major concern. There’s been a decline in harvesting since the closure of several mills starting in 2020—including the Verso Mill in Wisconsin Rapids and the Park Falls Paper Mill.

Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association Executive Director Henry Scheinebeck says those mills were taking in about 30% of the pulp produced in the state.

“We're growing, at a minimum, two times more than we're harvesting,” Schienebeck said at a press conference in Madison Monday.

Because of the decline, Scheinebeck supports legislation being introduced that would incentivize the building of an aviation bio-fuel facility in Hayward.

He says maintaining sustainable harvesting is important for forest health and the economy.

“This is the number two industry in the state. We're still, fortunately, the number one paper producing industry in the nation,” said Schienebeck. “If we can keep that going along with sustainable aviation fuel for the future, I think this is a win-win.”

The plant would take low quality wood and convert it to aviation biofuel.

While the U.S. has not required the use of this fuel type, the European Union has called for 70% of jet fuel to be sustainable by 2050.

The legislation introduced Monday would authorize the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation to create an aviation biofuel tax credit of $60 million as an Enterprise Zone Tax Credit.

It would also award the company that wants to build the facility a grant of $150 million through state bonding, which would be repaid through the Forestry Account.

Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) is one of the bill authors.

“There is going to be an increasing demand for this type of fuel, and we are right at the forefront here in Wisconsin,” she said. “We have a piece of legislation right now that will help spearhead this investment.”

In return, the company would source 80% of biomass needed to make the fuel from Wisconsin’s forests and invest $1.5 billion in economic activities in the state within five years. Felzkowski said the plant would provide about 150 jobs.

Michigan and Minnesota are also being considered as locations for the plant, according to Felzkowski.

“The state that helps will be the first state there, and they will also have the headquarters then located at that,” she said. “There is a little bit of pressure to be the state that helps so that they have the first plant and hopefully the headquarters.”

Northwoods Republican lawmakers introduced a bill that would spend $210 million in state assistance to help attract a $1.5 billion plant in Hayward. It would turn bark, branches, cutter shavings, tree tops, slash and forestry processing residue into fuel for airplanes.

Senate President Mary Felzkowski, of Tomahawk, during a press conference Monday morning said Wisconsin is competing with Michigan and Minnesota to attract a new business headquarters.

“There is a little bit of pressure to be the state that helps,” she said.

State Rep. Jeff Mursau, R-Crivitz, said the project would be a boost to a forestry industry that has taken a downtown after the closure of a paper mill in Wisconsin Rapids. Before that, the state had been harvesting 1.2 million cords. It’s now down to 839,000 cords, and the proposed project would add 440,000 cords to the annual harvest.

The project would be a partnership between Wisconsin-based Johnson Timber and Synthec Fuels, a German company with a Wisconsin subsidiary. It would be located on property adjacent to the Johnson Timber plant in Hayward, and the Wisconsin company would do the initial processing of the wood that would be turned into the sustainable aviation fuel.

The legislation calls for $60 million in WEDC Enterprise Zone Tax Credits and $150 million in state bonding that would be supported through the forestry account. Felzkowski said the plant would employ 150 people.

Felzkowski argued Wisconsin is primed to be a leader of sustainable aviation fuel as the market grows due to sustainable aviation fuel mandates in the European Union. The mandates require aviation fuel to be a 2% blend with sustainable aviation fuels in 2025, growing to 70% in 2050.

That means the EU would require over a trillion gallons of biofuel by 2050, Felzkowski added.

“So there is going to be an increasing demand for this type of fuel, and we are right at the forefront here in Wisconsin,” she argued.

The bill would also require Johnson Timber and Synthec Fuels to invest the $1.5 billion in the facility in the first five years, and that 80% of the biomass used to create the fuel come from Wisconsin.

Sawyer County Administrator Mark Markgren said the new plant would help bring demand back to the logging industry after several paper and pulp mills have shut down in the past few years.

“It would bring back the forestry industry and all the subsidiaries that would help, probably another 200 jobs at least. And all of those would be a living wage,” he said. “It would just be a huge economic boon for the local economy, which is suffering right now.”

Following a successful year-long trial on the Incheon–Haneda route, the airline is now deploying a 1% SAF blend on flights from Incheon to Kobe and from Gimpo to Osaka. This move aligns with broader national plans to reduce aviation emissions and support the transition to cleaner energy in the skies.

New SAF Routes Strengthen Commitment to Carbon Reduction

Starting September 19, 2025, Korean Air began operating with a 1% SAF blend on two additional routes: Incheon–Kobe (KE731) and Gimpo–Osaka (KE2117). This expansion will continue through December 31, 2026, covering approximately 90 flights to Kobe and 26 to Osaka. The fuel, derived from used cooking oil and supplied by domestic refiners HD Hyundai Oilbank and GS Caltex, meets international standards under ICAO’s CORSIA framework.

Building on a successful Trial program

The airline’s decision to expand SAF usage follows a successful trial on its Incheon–Haneda route, conducted from August 2024 to August 2025. During this period, Korean Air tested the performance and safety of SAF, gaining confidence in its viability as a cleaner alternative to conventional jet fuel. With SAF capable of reducing life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80%, the trial played a critical role in validating the fuel’s operational reliability.

Preparing for Future Regulations and Industry Trends

Korean Air’s initiative also positions it ahead of impending government regulations. Starting in 2027, South Korea will require all outbound flights to use at least a 1% SAF blend, with this mandate increasing to 3–5% by 2030 and up to 10% by 2035. By proactively adopting SAF now, Korean Air not only supports national climate goals but also signals its leadership in sustainable aviation within Asia and beyond.

BRISBANE AIRPORT, QLD, AUSTRALIA, September 23, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- • Stralis Aircraft is testing groundbreaking high-temperature fuel cell technology that will power emission free, cost effective and quieter aircraft in the future.

• Stralis Aircraft has been working with Air New Zealand, Hiringa Energy and the NZ Product Accelerator to set up and undertake the testing in Air New Zealand’s engine test cell facility at Auckland Airport

• The testing will collect performance data that will help Stralis understand degradation rates to support a credible lifetime assessment for the fuel cell system product.

Australian clean-tech startup Stralis Aircraft is testing its groundbreaking high-temperature fuel cell technology in an Auckland test facility, to help enable Australasia’s first hydrogen-electric flights. Working with the support of Air New Zealand, the NZ Product Accelerator hosted by University of Auckland and Hiringa Energy, hydrogen fuel cell testing has been made possible.

Stralis Aircraft is developing fuel cells to power high-performance, low operating cost, hydrogen-electric propulsion systems for aircraft and other heavy transport applications. Their proprietary high temperature PEM fuel-cell technology is significantly lighter than existing alternatives, enabling aircraft to fly ten times further than battery-electric solutions at a lower cost than fossil-fuel-powered planes. The company is already testing its fuel cells in the U.S. but has now started testing closer to home in New Zealand.

The testing will provide data that will help Stralis understand degradation mechanisms and degradation rates to support a credible lifetime assessment for the fuel cell system product. Achieving long life HTPEM fuel cells is important to deliver engine maintenance cost savings to airline customers. This measured data will help quantify maintenance savings and encourage adoption of the technology.

Stralis’s propulsion technology delivers significant benefits: zero emissions (producing only water vapour), up to 50% lower operating costs, and reduced noise. Their system integrates their fuel cells, liquid hydrogen tanks, and electric motors into existing and new aircraft designs, and plans to achieve the first flight of its six-seat Bonanza A36 technology demonstrator aircraft later this year in Queensland, Australia.

Stuart Johnstone, co-founder and CTO of Stralis Aircraft says “We are proud to be working with Air New Zealand to test our unique fuel cell technology in their engine test facility at Auckland Airport. New Zealand is an ideal location to develop, test and adopt emission free aircraft technology, so it is a great place to build capability and understanding. The test cell is attractive because it has lots of capacity to grow and enable testing of our higher power systems. It is great to be working with businesses in Australasia to make hydrogen-electric and zero-emission aviation a reality. With the help of our Kiwi partners, we have managed to get the test cell operational in “record” time”.

Matthew Connolly, Air New Zealand’s Sustainability Lead Energy Transition, says “Across Air New Zealand we have a significant programme dedicated to preparing for the future of flight, and the energy transition is a critical part of this work. That’s where opening the engine test cell facility to innovative companies such as Stralis comes in, as another step in our collective learning about new technologies, future engine propulsion, and new ways that aircraft will fly people and goods in a lower-carbon future. We believe Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), hydrogen and electricity will all be critical parts of a future aviation eco-system, and we’re proud to be supporting the innovation that Stralis is testing here in New Zealand.”

Hydrogen-electric propulsion systems have fewer moving parts and operate at lower temperatures compared to existing aircraft engines, which is predicted to reduce engine maintenance costs by between 40-60%. This is similar to the maintenance cost reductions seen between combustion engine and electric cars. The hydrogen stored onboard in a tank, powers a fuel cell that generates electricity to power an electric motor, that drives a propellor. Hydrogen-electric propulsion systems can be used for aircraft battery replacement, retrofit airframes, new clean sheet designs or even as auxiliary power units (APUs) onboard larger aircraft.

More information for editors:

More than 190 countries, including Australia and New Zealand, have agreed to target net zero carbon emissions from aviation in 2050. By the mid 2030’s, the sector needs to be actively deploying zero emission technologies and solutions. One solution that can genuinely reduce CO2 and non-CO2 emissions is hydrogen-electric propulsion. The only emission released from a hydrogen-electric fuel cell powertrain is water.

Green hydrogen is produced through electrolysis of water using renewable electricity. Hydrogen’s energy density is three times higher than kerosene and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and it is over 100 times higher than batteries, with a relatively fast refuelling capability when using liquid hydrogen. In the last five years, the aviation sector has turned to hydrogen as a credible alternative fuel to reduce emissions, costs and noise, although it has been flown in multiple demonstrator aircraft globally since 1957.

Stralis is developing a hydrogen electric propulsion system in which electricity is supplied to an electric propeller motor via a fuel cell. The system generates power through the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen (from ambient air) within a fuel cell stack. However, current commercially available fuel cell systems remain too heavy to meet the strict performance and weight requirements of commercial aviation. Stralis is developing a novel lightweight fuel cell based around a new type of high temperature membrane, which allows Stralis to achieve higher propulsion system specific power making it suitable. If Stralis meets our reasonable cost and lifetime targets, we will be able to cut the operating cost of a 50 seat, propeller driven aircraft in half, compared to today’s Jet Fuel burning turboprop aircraft.

Globally, most domestic aviation services could be serviced by emerging battery electric (short range) and hydrogen-electric (medium range) technologies reducing an estimated 50% of global air travel CO2 emissions that come from flights under 2200km. Considering both emissions reduction and aircraft performance in terms of range and power, hydrogen-electric aircraft offers a credible alternative.

It is precisely this core function that is now threatened by a misguided energy policy.
Policy should no longer focus on subsidizing failed projects by fossil fuel giants, but on strengthening our real assets: logistical efficiency, an advanced circular economy, and high-tech innovation.","The departure of Shell and BP from the port of Rotterdam comes as no surprise, but is the predictable outcome of a disastrous policy, writes Merien ten Houten in this opinion piece. For decades, Dutch politicians have taken a double, fatal gamble: they have outsourced the energy transition to the fossil fuel industry itself and bet on the technological mirage of biofuels. The result is a looming deindustrialization, in which the port is no longer the beating heart but threatens to become a museum of faded glory.

Shell and the myth of sustainable aviation fuel

The political obsession with biofuels as a quick fix for sustainability has been mercilessly debunked by the industry itself. The final nail in the coffin came from Shell CEO Wael Sawan, who openly admitted that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is not a serious alternative. According to Sawan, SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of total demand in aviation, and can only grow with strict, enforced mandates. This is not a sign of confidence; it is an admission that the business case simply does not exist without government coercion. Politicians have invested billions in a solution that the intended producer itself does not believe in. The withdrawal of Shell and BP is therefore a cold, business decision based on an irrefutable fact: the strategy is a failure.

Wrong choices, wrong partners

The root of the problem lies deeper than a wrong choice of technology. It is the fundamental misconception that innovation can come from the old, established order. An opinion piece by current CDA leader Henri Bontenbal from 2020 painfully exposes this naivety. He argued for close cooperation with Shell to shape the transition. This is like asking Kodak to invent the digital camera or giving a tobacco manufacturer the lead in an anti-smoking campaign. It is a strategic blunder of the first order. Despite all the green rhetoric, large fossil fuel companies are primarily focused on maximizing profits from their existing fossil fuel activities. Asking them to lead the transition is asking them to dismantle their own revenue model. It is a recipe for delays, half-hearted projects, and an eventual return to fossil fuel core activities as soon as the wind changes.

The illusion of a Dutch energy superpower

The crisis in the port forces us to ask an even more fundamental question: what battle is the Netherlands actually trying to fight? The port is not only an energy hub, but above all a global player in logistics, storage, transshipment, and general cargo. It is precisely this core function that is now threatened by a misguided energy policy. Should a densely populated country without its own oil, with limited space for sun and wind, really want to compete with regions that have an overwhelming natural advantage?

Countries in the Middle East have oil and sun. Spain has space and sun. Iceland has an abundance of geothermal and hydroelectric power. Competing with these countries in energy production is a battle that the Netherlands will lose from the outset. Politicians must stop pursuing this illusion and focus on what the Netherlands can excel at.

A radical change of course is inevitable. Policy should no longer focus on subsidizing failed projects by fossil fuel giants, but on strengthening our real assets: logistical efficiency, an advanced circular economy, and high-tech innovation. Only by making these tough, strategic choices can the port of Rotterdam maintain its relevance and avoid becoming a silent witness to a failed industrial past.",https://ioplus.nl/api/media/file/waalhaven-rotterdam-2975676_1280-6.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 08:56:56.110690

This study addresses the direct reduction of iron ore with hydrogen and solar energy as the process heat source for clean iron/steel making and decarbonation of the metallurgical process. A novel rotary-type solar reactor was designed, constructed and tested for demonstration of hydrogen-based direct iron ore reduction under real direct solar irradiation. Such a solar reactor concept for clean ironmaking has never been implemented before. The reactor was first simulated to determine the temperature field, gas velocity, and H2 mole fraction contours in the directly-heated cavity for design validation. The on-sun experimental study focused on reactor testing and performance analysis (including Fe products yields and quality). The effect of increasing temperature (>900–1000 °C at the cavity center, depending on cavity size) or H2 flow rate (0.5–1–2 NL/min), and decreasing particle size on promoting the reduction extent was emphasized. Two different cavity designs and materials (stainless steel and mullite) were also considered to show their impact on the process performance. Using a ceramic cavity with smaller diameter allowed reaching higher temperatures over 1000 °C at its center, with faster heating rates and enhanced conversion. High Fe2O3 particle conversion up to 100 % was obtained based on continuous quantification of the H2 consumed by the reduction reaction. Solid products analysis (XRD, SEM/EDX) confirmed the production of pure Fe by the solar-driven process, therefore offering a promising route toward sustainable solar metallurgy.

The service allows companies to track the emissions from their flights and contribute to the purchase of SAF through a co-funding model. The emission reductions are verified by a third party, and customers receive an audited SAF certificate that can be used in sustainability reporting.

The reductions are allocated using a book-and-claim model, which means companies can claim the benefits of SAF even if the fuel is not physically used on their own flights.

Tuomo Karppinen, Finnair’s Head of Environment, said the initiative is part of a broader effort to make flying more sustainable. “Real progress requires cooperation across the system – from policymakers and energy producers to airlines and customers. With this new service, we want to speed up the adoption of alternative aviation fuels made from renewable materials.”

In 2024, about 0.5% of Finnair’s fuel purchases were SAF. This year, the airline aims to nearly triple that share. Finnair is working with partners such as Neste to expand the use of renewable fuels.

Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel, produced from materials including used cooking oil and animal fat waste, can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its life cycle compared to fossil jet fuel.

The platform allows attendees to calculate their flight-related emissions and purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) certificates that meet SABA’s environmental standards. It is the first time such a tool has been made available to all COP participants, including those outside SABA membership, as part of efforts to boost awareness and adoption of SAF.

Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and Head of the SABA Secretariat, said the initiative responds to a long-standing concern. “For years, people traveling to COP have worried about the emissions from their flights. Now they will have a way to measure and reduce those emissions while supporting the wider use of sustainable aviation fuel.”

The SAF used in this initiative will be supplied by SkyNRG following a competitive process run by SABA earlier this year.

Theye Veen, Chief Commercial Officer and Co-Founder of SkyNRG, welcomed the collaboration. “We’ve spent over a decade building supply chains and sustainability standards for SAF. This platform opens access to more people and helps the industry grow.”

Through the platform, commercial travelers will use Google’s Travel Impact Model to calculate emissions, while private jet passengers will rely on the Eurocontrol Small Emitters tool. After estimating emissions, attendees can purchase SAF certificates vetted by SABA. Buyers will then receive confirmation from the SAFc Registry, which ensures the process meets best-in-class chain-of-custody standards.

Elizabeth Sturcken, Vice President of Net Zero Ambition & Action at Environmental Defense Fund, said the platform’s strength lies in its quality assurance. “Not all sustainable fuels are the same. SABA has already vetted the fuel so buyers know their investment truly reduces emissions.”

SAF, produced from renewable or waste-based feedstocks, can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure. While it currently accounts for only a small share of global aviation fuel, initiatives like this aim to expand demand and investment.

Bryan Fisher, Managing Director at RMI, noted the broader impact. “This isn’t just about travel emissions. It shows how demand signals and trusted systems like the SAFc Registry can drive investment and speed up adoption of cleaner fuels.”

Since its launch in 2021, SABA has directed around $200 million toward SAF investments, including a multi-year procurement involving 27 organizations and supporting 50 million gallons of fuel. The COP30 platform marks SABA’s third procurement in 2025, following the launch of SAFc Connect and a new program to support next-generation SAF projects.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-12.png,N,,2025-09-23 05:56:11.011668

The airline offered an operations-focused environmental strategy, and it was recognized for its ability to execute this strategy. The airline reaffirmed its commitment to its Net Zero by 2050 roadmap, urging radical industry and government action.

The airline's full-year 2025 emissions intensity was set at 52.2 grams per passenger-kilometer, and by 2030, Wizz Air targets a 25% cut in carbon intensity and aims for 10% of flights to be powered by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The carrier's strategy rests on three pillars, including flights, fuel, and footprint, with the airline looking to reduce emissions by 30% through its fleet renewal strategy alone.

A Deeper Look At The Company's Sustainability Award

Wizz Air recently won 'Sustainable Airline of the Year 2025' at the Airline Economics Sustainability Awards Gala, which was held at the Natural History Museum in London during the Growth Frontiers London event and hosted on September 17, 2025. The judges recognized the airline's interest in maintaining industry-leading transparent reporting standards and investment in an extremely fuel-efficient fleet, according to an analysis from AeroTime Hub.

Low-cost airlines are some of the most interested in lowering carbon emissions, as reducing fuel costs contributes to their cost advantage. The airline aims for 10% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) usage by 2030, making Wizz Air one of the most committed to reducing its overall carbon footprint.

This award helps highlight the process that Wizz Air is making towards low-carbon flying across flights, fuel, and its overall carbon footprint. In a statement, Dorottya Durucsko, the Head of Government Affairs and Sustainability at Wizz Air, had the following words to share:

""Recognition from Airline Economics and Estuaire strengthens our belief that we are on the right path of strengthening ecosystem of aviation. Let’s WIZZ.""

What Does This Award Mean For Wizz Air?

Winning this landmark award certainly offers a credibility boost for Wizz Air that can be converted into direct improvements in financial performance. For customers, the airline's focus on sustainability offers some reputational improvements, especially when it comes to corporate travelers with ESG mandates. This validates choosing Wizz Air on high-volume European routes over other players, something the airline would like, especially when it competes with legacy players.

For investors and aircraft lessors, this award reinforces the thesis that even in a low-cost, high-utilization model, airlines can reduce per-passenger carbon emissions and potentially improve capital access and lease terms for customers. This continues to strengthen Wizz's hand in SAF offtake talks and airport slot negotiations, where noise and carbon emissions are very important.

Internally, this award rallies employees around its Net Zero plan, and it helps create a healthy pressure for the company to deliver on its target sustainability metrics. The flip side of this is that the airline faces increased scrutiny when it comes to emissions reporting, SAF sourcing, and on-time fleet renewal.

The Bottom Line

At the end of the day, Wizz Air is a low-cost carrier capable of carbon-conscious operations. As low-cost airlines typically face the highest cost pressures, many shy away from engaging directly with the more expensive aspects of ensuring sustainability in air travel operations.

Furthermore, there are also many steps left for airlines to take to reduce carbon emissions. Some carriers have taken more audacious steps than others, underscoring their ability to perform under pressure from investors.

All of this, and more, means that aviation will not be able to completely decarbonize any time soon. The days of hydrogen-powered aircraft that emit zero carbon are long ahead of us, and passengers will still see some individual carbon output for years to come.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wizz-air-airbus-a320.jpeg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-23 05:56:19.484889

The airline association warns that an adequate supply of SAF remains the industry’s most significant hurdle to decarbonization.

At the same time, troubling reports over the environmental impact of some feedstocks used to produce sustainable aviation fuel raise questions over whether there is reliable control of the supply chain.

SAF Supply Is Critical To Meet Airline Net Zero Targets

“SAF is absolutely critical to the industry achieving its net zero CO₂ emissions by 2050,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, during a press briefing last week, ahead of the International Civil Aviation Organization’s meeting. “We’re disappointed at the progress that has been made in relation to the production of SAF. It’s not where we need it to be…The problem, as we see it, is one of supply and not one of demand.”

IATA urges governments to provide direct incentives to producers, harmonize global standards, and reaffirm the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) as the only international framework for carbon offsetting. Walsh warned that SAF costs are rising, without resulting in higher production levels, due to overlapping national and regional mandates to adopt sustainable fuels.

SAF Supply Chain Credibility Under Pressure

For many years, IATA has said that it supports sustainable feedstocks for SAF. However, a recent Reuters investigation revealed that Diamond Green Diesel, a major U.S. biofuel refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, sourced beef tallow from Brazilian suppliers linked to illegal deforestation in the Amazon.

Despite the links, the refinery’s fuels are certified under the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification system and count toward CORSIA compliance. This allows airlines such as JetBlue and Southwest to claim emissions reductions. Critics argue that certification loopholes—specifically, treating tallow as a byproduct of beef production—mask indirect deforestation impacts.

Since 2022, the refinery has received more than $3 billion in U.S. tax credits.

From Sargassum To SAF: Innovation From Mexico’s Caribbean Coast

New pathways for SAF feedstock are emerging. Mexico is exploring the potential for sargassum algae—an invasive seaweed that has overwhelmed Caribbean beaches in recent years—as a potential SAF input. The project, supported by Mexico’s environment ministry and EU partners, will process sargassum at a new Circular Economy Centre in Quintana Roo.

Researchers in Puerto Rico, backed by the U.S. Department of Energy, are also exploring how to convert the troublesome algae into biofuels. The approach offers significant advantages: sargassum is abundant, does not require farmland, and provides a solution to an environmental problem that threatens local ecosystems and tourism.

For IATA SAF Technology Delays Outweigh Feedstock Supply Issues

However, IATA doesn’t feel that developing new feedstocks alone can fix the problem of SAF production.

“Feedstock is not the hindrance here for us reaching the 500 million tons of SAF that we need in 2050,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Chief Economist and SVP for Sustainability, during the IATA briefing. “The main bottleneck is actually how quickly we can mature and bring the technologies to commercial viability. They need a lot of support and incentives to be able to mature quickly.”

Walsh agreed, saying: “There’s a strong case to be made for aviation to have a fair share of the available feedstocks, principally because the airline industry is difficult to decarbonize. In the short to medium term, there’s plenty of feedstock available to fulfill the requirements for the airline industry.”

Setting A Successful SAF Policy

The 42nd ICAO Assembly could establish the framework for global aviation sustainability policy in the years to come. For IATA, the priorities are to ensure aviation has access to a fair share of available feedstocks, that governments provide incentives for producers to scale up, and to prevent policy fragmentation that could drive SAF costs higher without boosting output.

“We’re concerned that we’re not making sufficient progress in that area. We’re also concerned about the unintended consequences of some of the mandates that have been introduced, particularly under EU RefuelEU and in the UK, where fuel suppliers are mandated to produce 2% of SAF,” Walsh said. “This has led to a significant increase in fuel costs for airlines operating in the EU and in the UK, but has not translated into a significant increase in the production of SAF.”

Whether the airline argument results in favorable government action after the Montreal meeting is still an open question, though Walsh expressed optimism that it would.

The ICAO Assembly will decide whether SAF is a credible path toward net-zero aviation or if supply shortages, skepticism, and failed policies undermine airlines’ climate commitments.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68d25596657ce41d9856dfca/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-23 05:56:23.954951

Mrvan’s letter to Secretary Duffy stated:

“Dear Secretary Duffy,

I write today regarding awarded projects under the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Fueling Aviation’s Sustainable Transition (FAST) Grant Program.

In August 2024, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) announced the FAA awarded approximately $291 million to 36 projects in 22 states through the FAST Grant Program. This investment in advancing the nation’s development of low-emission aviation technologies heavily favored applicants dedicated to producing, transporting, blending, or storing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The infrastructure proposed for construction under these awarded projects aimed to put to work our building and construction trades at the onset, then support the capacity for new jobs and develop supply chain partnerships upon completion, thereby increasing the competitiveness and efficiencies within the commercial aviation and aerospace industry.

Recently, and regrettably, it has come to my attention that some awardees under the FAST Grant Program received notification from the FAA that FAST-SAF grant awards are rescinded.

This update as to the partnership between the government and awardees is disheartening given the magnitude of increased economic impact these projects would have within their respective regions as well as nationally. One such project is the award for CITGO’s East Chicago Terminal, in Indiana’s First Congressional District, where the project would be integrated into the existing jet fuel distribution hub and where existing pipeline infrastructure allows for the movement of fuel to Chicago O’Hare, Chicago Midway, Rockford and Milwaukee airports. The awarded proposal noted jet fuel end users at commercial and general aviation airports would be positioned to benefit from the project, including over forty airlines utilizing commercial airports within the Chicago region.

As we work to create opportunities for employment and wealth throughout our nation, the disinvestment in America’s aviation supply chains and within the commercial aviation and aerospace industry is counterproductive to the efforts to invest in America, particularly in manufacturing, technology, and infrastructure. I respectfully ask for your insight as to the rescinding of FAST Grant Program awards and as to similar future funding opportunities that DOT may offer.

New environmental objective – climate adaption: The Phase 2A Taxonomy introduces climate change adaptation as a new environmental objective.
Localised for Hong Kong and adjacent regions - The Adaptation Framework prioritises the most relevant adaptation-related investments for Hong Kong and its adjacent regions that face similar physical risks.","On 8 September 2025, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched a public consultation on Phase 2A prototype of the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance (the Phase 2A Taxonomy).

The Phase 2A Taxonomy builds on Phase 1 of the Hong Kong Taxonomy published in May 2024 (see our previous blog post) by adding new sectors, economic activities, and transition elements. The Phase 2A Taxonomy also introduces climate change adaptation as an environmental objective, being one of the first few taxonomy frameworks globally to address this issue.

To recap - the Hong Kong Taxonomy aims to provide guidance for market participants to make more informed investment decisions regarding “green” and sustainable finance products in order to scale up the flow of capital towards green and sustainable assets, projects, and investments (not only in Hong Kong, but also in Mainland China and internationally). It is intended to provide market participants with greater confidence in sustainability claims, addressing greenwashing concerns and enhance comparability across portfolios and investments.

In this blog, we set out the key developments in the Phase 2A Taxonomy:

Expanded sector coverage

Two new sectors - manufacturing and information and communications technology - have been added to the four sectors under the Phase 1 Taxonomy (being energy; transportation; construction; and waste), therefore, increasing the total number of sectors from four to six.

Increase in economic activities

13 new economic activities have been added, bringing the total number of economic activities from 12 to 25. Updates have also been made to the technical screening criteria of a number of activities introduced under the Phase 1 Taxonomy.

The table below (reproduced from the consultation document) sets out the expansion of scope from Phase 1 to Phase 2A with new activities in bold:

* Activities published in Phase 1 and updated in Phase 2

Transition elements

The Phase 1 Taxonomy focused on defining criteria for “green” activities under the climate change mitigation environmental objectives whereas the Phase 2A Taxonomy introduces a “transition” category. As with other transition taxonomies developed in certain Asia jurisdictions, the aim is to scale up transition finance to high-emitting sectors, such as energy and manufacturing.

For activities focused on climate change mitigation, the Phase 2A Taxonomy adopts a classification framework that categorises activities as Green, Transition, or Exclusion, based on their level of alignment with the globally recognised Paris Agreement 1.5°C climate goals.

Activities classified as Green are those that contribute substantially to climate change mitigation.

The Transition category covers “carbon-intensive activities that are on a time-bound decarbonisation journey to align their operations with a 1.5°C trajectory, ultimately reaching net zero in 2050”. The Transition category also covers activities or measures that enable substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the short term, even if these activities or measures ultimately may, or may not, align with the Green criteria. Accordingly, the two types of classifications under the Transition category are (i) “Transition Activity” and (ii) “Transition Measure”.

The Exclusion Category activities are currently not eligible under the Hong Kong Taxonomy, because, for example, the activity is not compatible with, or is not progressing rapidly enough towards, a 1.5°C decarbonisation pathway.

For the Transition category to apply, the Phase 2A Taxonomy sets out the following principles:

Transition applies only to activities with limited or no low-carbon alternatives to decarbonise - For example, fossil-based land transport vehicles are not eligible under the Hong Kong Taxonomy, as low-carbon alternatives such as electric vehicles are available.

Transition requires demonstrable progress – A suitable level of reduction in emissions intensity and/or an increase in energy efficiency to show steady improvement and growing alignment with the Green criteria must be demonstrated. Where feasible, forward-looking thresholds, based on currently available technologies, should be established for different time periods, reflecting anticipated improvements. These thresholds are subject to review in future iterations of the Hong Kong Taxonomy and may potentially be revised as new technologies and methodologies emerge.

Transition is time-bound - A “sunset date” must be set by which point all activities must either fully meet the Green criteria or be deemed non-aligned with the Hong Kong Taxonomy. Sunset dates are determined based on a range of factors and therefore vary across sectors / activities e.g. the maritime transport sector has a sunset date of 2030, while the energy sector has a longer lead time till 2035.

Transition focuses on existing infrastructure - Transition should primarily apply to existing infrastructure and activities, rather than new developments to prevents carbon lock-in and ensure that the development and deployment of low-carbon alternatives are not hindered.

New environmental objective – climate adaption:

The Phase 2A Taxonomy introduces climate change adaptation as a new environmental objective. Climate change adaption has been introduced as one of the core objectives to address the growing funding needs for managing physical risks and responding to the increasing frequency of extreme weather events.

The adaptation framework set out in the Phase 2A Taxonomy (the Adaption Framework) has the following four core principles:

Building block approach for phased development – Recognising that climate change adaptation is relatively nascent and still evolving, the Adaptation Framework adopts a “building block approach” so that it can be expanded as circumstances and market needs change.

Localised for Hong Kong and adjacent regions - The Adaptation Framework prioritises the most relevant adaptation-related investments for Hong Kong and its adjacent regions that face similar physical risks.

Adapting measures-focused - The Phase 2A Taxonomy prioritises the water sector (with flood damage and water stress being identified as two climate hazards for the sector). It identifies four “adapting measures” within the water sector using the “whitelist approach” (explained below).

Graduated assessment approach – Similar to mitigation activities, adaptation-related investments must meet the defined substantial contribution criteria to be deemed taxonomy-aligned. Initially, the Adaptation Framework relies on a Whitelist approach which puts forward a “whitelist” of adapting measures that are automatically deemed eligible without the need to meet specific criteria.

What’s next?

The public consultation closes on 8 October 2025. The consultation paper is available on the HKMA website.

The Phase 2A Taxonomy is clear that the intention is for the scope of the taxonomy to evolve and expand in response to market dynamics, technological advancements, policy priorities and evolving green and sustainable practices and expectations.

Areas under consideration for future development on the Hong Kong Taxonomy include, in the energy sector, natural gas-fired power generation and nuclear energy power generation as transitional and low-carbon energy sources, as well as hydrogen for electricity generation; in the transportation sector, air transport, including emerging technologies to reduce emissions in the aviation sector (e.g. sustainable aviation fuel); and in the manufacturing sector, activities such as the production of cement, iron and steel, basic chemicals, low-carbon liquid fuels, and biofuels. Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) is a new sector which is under review, while the role of “Do No Significant Harm” will be explored in future iterations of the Hong Kong Taxonomy.

In terms of climate adaption, other climate hazards significant to Hong Kong and its adjacent regions - for instance, storm damage, mass movement damage, and heat stress - will be explored in future iterations of the Taxonomy.",https://images.passle.net/fit-in/1200x630/Passle/5f6c57568cb62a0d7c9eadee/SearchServiceImages/2025-09-22-08-31-56-334-68d1097c4212553ec5d5fd66.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 06:56:53.087634

Danny Elia, IFM executive director, global asset management, infrastructure, told Agri Investor that the government has “absolutely delivered” on its commitment last year to produce policy to boost the development of low-carbon liquid fuels.
Currently, Australia exports about A$4 billion worth of feedstocks for low-carbon fuels including canola and tallow.
Elia said standing up a low-carbon liquid fuel industry in Australia could bring benefits for agricultural investors, including more domestic crushing facilities.
According to research by Deloitte for Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation, liquid fuels account for about 32 percent of national emissions.","The Australian government is investing A$1.1 billion ($728 million; €618 million) in a program to support the domestic production of low-carbon liquid fuels.

The Cleaner Fuels program will offer funding to producers of fuels including sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and e-fuels, for use in “hard-to-abate” sectors like aviation, heavy freight and mining.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers and other government representatives made the announcement at transport fuel provider Ampol’s oil refinery in Queensland, where Ampol is developing a A$2 billion renewable fuels facility in partnership with asset manager IFM Investors and grain processor GrainCorp.

Danny Elia, IFM executive director, global asset management, infrastructure, told Agri Investor that the government has “absolutely delivered” on its commitment last year to produce policy to boost the development of low-carbon liquid fuels.

However, he said there are three prongs to this policy that need to be worked through: supply, demand, and certification.

“[Wednesday’s] announcement was a supply-side announcement, and that will ultimately help to reduce the cost to the end customers and support the feasibility of these investments,” Elia said.

“There are other areas of policy that will have to continue to evolve around certification – but there’s great consultation going on with government there – and then there’s demand-side support.

“Effectively, we’re talking about a mandate there.”

Australia does not yet have a mandate around the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), in contrast with the EU, which has required jet fuel suppliers to blend 2 percent SAF in with traditional fuels from 2025, and to increase this blend to 70 percent by 2050.

“The whole industry will need mandates because we’re talking about a new product,” Elia said.

“Everybody’s building up scale, the technology will get more cost-effective, supply chain will change to specialized feedstocks over time – all those things could take a decade, two decades.

“A mandate will be important because effectively we’ll otherwise be asking customers to buy a higher-cost product.”

Elia is pushing for a level of government support that allows local airlines to buy the SAF at around the same price as they could buy an imported product.

Currently, Australia exports about A$4 billion worth of feedstocks for low-carbon fuels including canola and tallow.

Elia said standing up a low-carbon liquid fuel industry in Australia could bring benefits for agricultural investors, including more domestic crushing facilities.

Currently, Australia exports most of its canola overseas, including more than 1.8 million tonnes annually to European countries, which can use it to make transport fuels, according to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

Fueling ambition

Since IFM partnered with Ampol and GrainCorp last year, Elia said it has spent more than A$30 million on engineering and technical feasibility assessments and has already signed agreements with technology providers.

The partnership has also increased its production ambitions from 500 million liters to about 750 million liters of SAF per year by 2030 – almost 40 percent of the government’s target of 2 billion liters by the same date.

Elia expects IFM to make a final investment decision on the Queensland SAF facility by mid-2026.

The Cleaner Fuels announcement comes as Australia prepares to present its updated emissions reduction target to the General Assembly of the UN next week.

On Thursday, prime minister Anthony Albanese announced a target to reduce emissions by 62-70 percent below 2005 levels by 2035.

Reducing emissions from liquid fuels could become an even more vital component in reaching this target as Australia’s offshore wind ambitions face a setback, with the state of Victoria this week delaying its first auction indefinitely.

According to research by Deloitte for Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation, liquid fuels account for about 32 percent of national emissions.

The CEFC report estimates that a domestic low-carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth A$36 billion by 2050, while cutting emissions by about 230 million tonnes CO2-e, which is equivalent to nearly half of Australia’s annual emissions.

Details of the Cleaner Fuels grants on offer are still being determined, with the government set to finalize the program design in 2026 and open applications by the following year.",https://media.agriinvestor.com/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2219151696.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 06:57:00.129768

This ambitious initiative is designed to reduce the industry’s dependence on imported fuels, create thousands of skilled jobs, and position Australia as a leader in clean aviation technology, driving both environmental responsibility and long-term economic growth.

Australia is preparing to transform its aviation sector with a historic investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The federal government has pledged AUD 1.1 billion (approximately \$720 million USD) over the next decade to establish a robust domestic SAF production industry. This funding will be distributed through grants to qualifying companies, enabling airlines to access locally produced alternatives to conventional jet fuel. The move marks a decisive step in reducing the nation’s reliance on imported fuels and accelerating the transition to low-carbon aviation.

The introduction of this program addresses multiple challenges facing the aviation sector. Air travel remains a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, and the demand for more sustainable solutions continues to rise globally. By building local SAF production capacity, Australia aims to tackle these emissions directly while also positioning itself as a leader in clean aviation technology. The initiative reflects a broader commitment to integrating environmental responsibility into the country’s transport and energy strategies.

Airlines across Australia have already signaled strong support for this program. They view SAF as a critical tool for achieving net-zero carbon goals and meeting growing regulatory requirements for carbon reduction. Although sustainable aviation fuel currently costs more than traditional jet fuel, increasing domestic production is expected to reduce prices over time. The government’s backing will provide the certainty and scale needed to make SAF a financially viable and widely adopted option for the aviation industry.

Scaling up SAF production carries benefits that extend far beyond the aviation sector. The initiative is poised to create thousands of new jobs across renewable energy, advanced manufacturing, and related fields. Regional economies stand to gain significantly as production facilities are established in locations outside major cities. This expansion will drive investment in infrastructure, boost local business opportunities, and foster economic development in areas that have historically relied on conventional industries.

The environmental impact of SAF adoption is substantial. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent depending on the feedstock and production process used. This reduction addresses both direct emissions from aircraft and the broader environmental footprint of fuel production. Airlines using SAF can report measurable progress toward sustainability targets, enhancing their environmental credentials and appealing to a growing population of eco-conscious travelers.

Travelers themselves are increasingly influencing the aviation industry’s shift toward sustainability. Many passengers now consider the environmental impact of their flights when choosing airlines and destinations. By integrating SAF into regular operations, Australian airlines can respond to this demand while strengthening their reputation for responsible travel. Hotels, resorts, and tourism operators benefit indirectly, as the adoption of low-carbon aviation options supports broader sustainability commitments and improves the overall environmental image of travel destinations across the country.

The government’s decade-long commitment signals that SAF will play a central role in Australia’s aviation strategy. Rather than relying on short-term incentives or ad hoc projects, the program provides a structured, long-term approach to developing a sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem. By supporting local production, the policy reduces dependence on imported fuels, strengthens energy security, and ensures that Australia benefits economically from the growing global market for SAF.

Innovation and research will play a key role in achieving these goals. Developing SAF at scale requires advancements in feedstock processing, bio-refining technologies, and supply chain logistics. Government funding will support companies investing in these areas, encouraging collaboration between energy producers, airlines, and research institutions. By fostering innovation, Australia can develop proprietary solutions that not only meet domestic demand but also position the country as a global exporter of sustainable aviation technologies.

In addition to its environmental and economic benefits, SAF contributes to energy diversification. As the aviation sector faces volatile fuel prices and geopolitical risks associated with imported fossil fuels, domestic SAF production provides a more stable, resilient energy source. This security allows airlines to plan operations with greater certainty and reduces exposure to international price fluctuations, benefiting both the industry and consumers.

The adoption of SAF also aligns with global sustainability trends. Governments, international aviation organizations, and major airlines are increasingly focused on decarbonizing air travel. By investing early and decisively, Australia can demonstrate leadership on the international stage and influence global standards for SAF production and use. This leadership strengthens the country’s negotiating position in climate discussions and opens opportunities for collaboration with other nations pursuing similar low-carbon aviation goals.

Looking ahead, the rollout of SAF is expected to accelerate further as production scales up and costs decline. Airlines will integrate SAF into flight operations, gradually increasing the proportion of sustainable fuel used across domestic and international routes. The resulting emissions reductions will support Australia’s broader climate targets, contribute to global aviation sustainability efforts, and help the industry adapt to evolving regulatory frameworks.

Ultimately, the government’s investment in sustainable aviation fuel represents a transformative step for Australia’s aviation sector. By establishing a domestic production base, supporting innovation, creating jobs, and promoting regional economic development, the SAF program ensures that low-carbon aviation becomes both feasible and competitive. For travelers, airlines, and the environment, the benefits are clear: cleaner skies, stronger local economies, and a sustainable path forward for air travel.

Australia has launched a one point one billion dollar sustainable aviation fuel initiative to cut emissions, reduce reliance on imports, and boost regional economies through job creation and clean energy growth.

With this decade-long commitment, sustainable aviation fuel is no longer a distant goal—it is becoming a central pillar of Australia’s aviation strategy.

CGF, a wholly owned subsidiary of Catagen, will use patented modular-reactor technology to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using off-grid renewable/low-carbon electricity sources—meaning fuel can continue to be produced consistently and is flexible and resilient to any fluctuations in grid connectivity.

Unlike centralized SAF projects that require large investments, lengthy approval processes, extended build times and extensive energy supply, ClimaHtech Green Flight is a decentralized, electrified, modular-production model.

Marking the launch of CGF, Catagen announced new strategic partnerships with Ryanair and Shell Aviation Ireland Ltd. for offtake agreements of SAF production and use.

The partnerships were unveiled at the ClimaHtech Technology Campus launch event, where Catagen showcased its patented BioHGen and eFuel Gen reactor technologies for producing SAF through two pathways: biobased SAF (power-and-biomass-to-liquid) and eSAF (power-to-liquid).

CGF production systems will be manufactured off-site and can be deployed close to renewable electricity assets or close to airports where fuel is needed and with minimal disruption to operations.

Using an industrial waste stream and renewable energy, each unit from CGF will be capable of producing 1 million liters (264,000 gallons) of SAF per year, with over 90 percent reduction in emissions from-well-to-wing compared to fossil jet fuel.

“Progressing towards our sustainability goals depends on securing scalable and affordable SAF,” said Steven Fitzgerald, Ryanair’s director of sustainability and finance. “Catagen’s decentralized SAF model allows production to be brought closer to demand, enabling faster deployment and reducing the bottlenecks that slow down traditional SAF projects. We see this as a critical pathway to reducing our emissions while continuing to deliver affordable travel.”

Ken McHutcheon, Shell Aviation Ireland’s supply and operations manager, added, “Shell Aviation is committed to scaling sustainable aviation fuel, but the industry needs both volume and speed. Catagen’s decentralized, modular approach provides a new way of producing SAF that can complement centralized facilities, shorten timelines and provide more flexible access to fuel. This model has the potential to reduce reliance on imported SAF, increase energy independence, unlock new markets and accelerate the industry’s journey to net zero.”

Mel Courtney, CEO ClimaHtech Green Flight, said, “The U.K. has a mandate to have 10 percent of flights using SAF by 2030, with the EU having a 70 percent target by 2050. On current supply, these targets are ambitious, with the International Air Transport Association currently estimating demand surpassing 360 million tons by 2050, up from 1 million tons that were available in 2024. To reach these targets, we need technologies that can be scaled up alongside the development of surrounding infrastructures around airports. In the U.K., challenges around energy security have been made clear, hence the push from government to increase our use of renewables in the grid. Our approach to SAF should match this approach and be accessible to the market where it is needed to be deployed. The launch of ClimaHtech Green Flight is the next step in our plan to decarbonize the aviation industry.”

Catagen was the first company to submit a sample of SAF to the EU SAF clearinghouse in 2024 and is progressing through fast-track certification on the ASTM D7566 Annex A1 approved pathway.

The company’s preproduction units, supported by the U.K. Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, are already operational.

Catagen’s first-of-a-kind SAF production system will reach commercial operation in a short time horizon, according to the company, producing 1 million liters (264,000 gallons) of SAF per year.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_b455ca0c11d242729a5c09487334c3c8~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_732,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/80995f_b455ca0c11d242729a5c09487334c3c8~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-09-23 03:56:19.245458

The report, prepared by the Ministry of Civil Aviation with the UN aviation body ICAO and supported by the European Union, estimates India could produce 14–33 million tonnes of SAF annually from sources such as vegetable oils, sugarcane bagasse, rice straw, and municipal solid waste. The figure does not include SAF from waste gas fermentation or power-to-liquid technologies.

ICAO’s Global Framework aims for a 5% cut in CO2 emissions from international flights by 2030 through SAF, lower-carbon aviation fuels, and cleaner energy. India has set targets of 1% SAF by 2027, 2% by 2028, and 5% by 2030 for international flights, in line with ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme (CORSIA).

The report calls for urgent policy action, including forming a SAF Council with senior officials and industry leaders to plan the sector’s growth. It also recommends a clear policy framework to tackle issues such as slow commercialisation and high production costs.

The alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) process is identified as the “largest opportunity” for India due to the availability of ethanol feedstocks and easier transport. However, the report warns of potential competition for ethanol from the road transport sector, where ethanol-blended petrol (E20) is being promoted.

Sustainable aviation fuel in Australia is set for a major boost as the federal government pledges AUD 1.1 billion (approx. $720 million USD) over the next decade to build a domestic production base. The funding will be distributed through grants to eligible companies, ensuring that aviation has access to locally produced alternatives to conventional jet fuel.

The investment comes after years of pressure from airlines and industry leaders, including former Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, who consistently highlighted the urgency of accelerating the transition to low-carbon aviation. By scaling up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Canberra aims to position Australia at the forefront of green aviation innovation.

Both Qantas and Virgin Australia have welcomed the initiative, noting that SAF is central to achieving their net-zero targets and addressing growing regulatory and consumer expectations around carbon reduction. At present, sustainable aviation fuel costs significantly more than traditional jet fuel, but building local production capacity is expected to narrow this price gap over time.

The broader benefits extend beyond aviation. The SAF program is expected to create new jobs in renewable energy and advanced manufacturing, while also supporting regional economies where production facilities may be established. For the travel and hospitality sector, the adoption of SAF strengthens environmental credentials and helps meet the demands of increasingly eco-conscious travelers.

The government’s long-term commitment underlines how sustainable aviation fuel in Australia is becoming a central pillar of its aviation policy.

If the project takes off, pulp from that facility would be used to make fuel for planes and other aircraft. Officials are eyeing a site for the wood pulp plant in Hayward, on a property that adjoins an existing LP Building Solutions manufacturing plant.

Five years ago, the Verso paper mill in Wisconsin Rapids shut down. That plant was a major consumer of pulpwood, and its closure left a “big hole” in Wisconsin’s pulpwood market, said state Senate President Mary Felzkowski, R-Tomahawk, who’s among the sponsors of legislation announced Monday.

Starting this year, airports within the European Union must use at least 2 percent of what’s known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, within their fuel mix. The United States does not currently impose such requirements, but the EU is set to increase its mandated SAF percentages in coming years.

SAF is an alternative to fossil fuel, and the goal of those requirements is to cut back on carbon emissions. SAF can include biofuels, such as energy made from pulped wood.

“There is going to be an increasing demand for this type of fuel, and we are right at the forefront here in Wisconsin,” Felzkowski said during a Monday morning news conference at the state Capitol.

A German company called Synthec Fuels is looking to run the plant in partnership with Wisconsin-based Johnson Timber, sponsors of the legislation said.

Synthec Fuels is also considering other locations in Minnesota or Michigan, Felzkowski said.

She suggested that the proposed tax incentives could help seal the deal for Wisconsin.

“There’s three states vying for this” Felzkowski said. “The state that helps will be the first state there, and they will also have the headquarters.”

The newly announced legislation would set aside $60 million in tax credits from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation for the project. Wisconsin would also give out a $150 million grant to help create the plant. That grant would be backed by public borrowing through the Wisconsin Department of National Resources’ forestry account.

In exchange, the company creating the plant would agree to invest at least $1.5 billion into the project over the first five years. And at least 80 percent of the wood that would be processed at the plant would need to come from Wisconsin forests over that same five-year period.

The facility is expected to create 150 jobs, legislative sponsors said. Those roles would help revitalize a local economy that’s been hit hard by a declining market for paper producers, said Mike Markgren, the county administrator in Sawyer County.

Hayward, where the plant could be located, is the largest city in that county.

“Logging fell on hard times after the paper mills began to close,” Markgren said. “Demand decreased, prices flattened and we suffered.”

Markgren said Sawyer County’s economy has been increasingly centered on tourism.

“Those hospitality jobs pay on average $37,000 annually, and that is likely with no benefits, so that is not a sustainable wage,” Markgren said.

In contrast, he hopes a new wood pulp factory will bring more “well-paying jobs with full benefits,” to the region.

“Anything that can be done to strengthen the diversification of industry in Sawyer County is very welcome,” Markgren said.

The legislation began circulating for cosponsors Monday. State Rep. Chanz Green, R-Grand View, was listed as lead sponsor, along with more than half a dozen other Republicans.

The office of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers did not respond to WPR’s request for comment Monday, but Felzkowski described the governor as “very interested” in the proposal.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/250806_MADISONWI05-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 18:56:08.148869

Elsewhere, Ben Minicucci, chief executive officer of Alaska Air Group, added that in Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the group has a “partner with the scientific, technical and commercial expertise to make effective investment decisions that will create the market for next-generation fuels and power our industry in the years ahead.”

Breakthrough Energy Ventures

Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which was founded by Bill Gates, will serve as the fund’s investment manager, bringing experience in evaluating early-stage climate technologies and supporting their transition to market.

Eric Toone, chief technology officer at Breakthrough Energy, said that SAF represents both an environmental requirement and a commercial opportunity.

“The oneworld BEV Fund is built to identify and scale breakthrough SAF technologies that can deliver real emissions reductions for jet fuel, compete with fossil-based fuels on cost, and integrate seamlessly with today’s aviation infrastructure,” he said. “These are complex systems-level challenges that will take time to solve, and the fund is built with the long-term vision and staying power to help bring solutions to market.”

SAF has been found to reduce lifecycle emissions of jet fuel by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

BP has canceled its planned Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production facility in Rotterdam. This decision aligns with a strategic shift back to focusing on its core oil and gas business, moving away from renewable energy investments.

Financial Viability

The primary reason for halting the project is its lack of financial competitiveness. BP's CEO, Murray Auchincloss, stated that the company had overextended into renewable projects, which were not yielding expected returns. The Rotterdam SAF project was deemed insufficiently competitive in the current market.

Market Challenges

The sustainable aviation fuel market faces challenges such as lower-than-expected growth and insufficient policy support, making large-scale projects less attractive. This has led BP and other energy companies like Shell and Equinor to scale back their clean energy ambitions.

Strategic Restructuring

BP plans to increase oil and gas investments by about 20% while cutting renewable energy investments by more than $5 billion annually. This shift aims to enhance financial performance and address debt concerns.

The deal comes at a pivotal moment, as it precedes the South Korean government's planned enforcement of a mandatory SAF blending regulation starting in 2027.

The partnership between the oil refiner and the national carrier is more than a simple supply agreement; it's a strategic effort to establish a commercial supply system well in advance of the government mandate. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy recently confirmed that South Korea will require a 1% SAF blend for all international flights starting in 2027, with discussions to increase this to 3-5% by 2030 and 7-10% by 2035. This policy aligns with global trends, as countries like the European Union and Japan have already introduced or announced similar regulations. The EU, for example, has a 2% blending mandate this year, which is set to rise to a substantial 70% by 2050.

The race for market dominance is fueling competition among South Korean refiners and chemical companies, who are exploring different production methods to meet the growing demand for SAF. HD Hyundai Oilbank is utilizing a process known as ""refinery co-processing,"" which involves processing bio-based feedstocks like waste cooking oil and animal fats alongside crude oil in existing facilities. This method offers the advantage of low initial investment and rapid market entry, as it doesn't require the construction of new plants. However, a key limitation is the restricted proportion of bio-based feedstocks that can be used, which curtails large-scale production capabilities. This is the method currently employed by most domestic refiners for their commercially supplied SAF.

In contrast, major global players are focusing on a more capital-intensive approach: the ""dedicated plant hydrogenation production method."" This process involves constructing a new, specialized facility to process waste cooking oil and vegetable oils with hydrogen, producing only SAF. While it requires a significant investment of hundreds of billions of won, it enables a stable, large-scale production system capable of fulfilling major international contracts.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-22 14:56:53.908683

For organizations committed to reducing their environmental footprint, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as one of the few actionable solutions capable of significantly lowering emissions associated with corporate air travel. Despite growing interest, large-scale adoption of SAF within the corporate travel sector has yet to gain substantial momentum.

To bridge this gap, a new initiative has been launched, introducing a dedicated learning and collaboration hub specifically designed for the corporate travel industry. This platform provides travel managers, procurement teams, and sustainability leaders with essential knowledge, resources, and strategies to understand, evaluate, and integrate SAF into their corporate travel programs.

The hub offers comprehensive guidance tailored to the needs of corporate buyers, including:

Clear explanations of SAF purchasing options and implementation strategies

Up-to-date market intelligence on SAF developments and trends

A collaborative environment for peer-to-peer knowledge sharing and industry engagement

Sustainable Aviation Fuel can reduce carbon emissions during production by up to 80% compared with conventional jet fuel. When combined with broader decarbonization strategies—such as influencing travel choices, setting emissions reduction targets, and engaging with suppliers across the travel value chain—SAF enables organizations to achieve meaningful reductions in travel-related emissions. Airlines project that SAF will become a cornerstone of the aviation sector’s decarbonization efforts by 2050, highlighting the potential for the $1.57 trillion global business travel industry to drive faster adoption.

Successfully implementing SAF at scale requires coordinated action across multiple stakeholders in the industry. Corporate travel managers, in particular, benefit from practical tools that help build strong business cases, engage internal teams, and communicate progress with credibility. A dedicated SAF hub equips organizations with insights into market conditions, supplier engagement strategies, and verified reporting approaches to strengthen sustainability outcomes.

Recent research underscores the urgency for increased awareness and adoption. Surveys show that only a small fraction of companies have purchased SAF certificates, and barriers such as limited budgets, lack of knowledge, and perceived procedural complexity remain significant obstacles. By showcasing companies with established SAF strategies, the hub seeks to inspire other organizations to explore sustainable aviation solutions, demonstrating that even small initial steps can generate measurable impact and build confidence for long-term implementation.

Key resources available through the hub include:

SAF Playbook for Corporate Travel: A detailed, step-by-step guide designed for travel managers, procurement teams, and sustainability professionals to confidently integrate SAF into corporate strategies.

Practical Tools and Peer-driven Insights: Access to webinars, case studies, and interactive discussions with industry peers, suppliers, and sustainability experts.

Community Connections: A global forum for sharing experiences, exchanging best practices, and fostering collaboration among corporate travel stakeholders and SAF experts.

In addition, the initiative coincides with major industry events, creating opportunities for dialogue and collaboration on the future of sustainable business travel. By combining practical tools, market intelligence, and a supportive peer network, the SAF hub positions organizations to accelerate emissions reduction efforts, demonstrate tangible progress, and contribute to the wider transition toward decarbonized aviation.

The introduction of this comprehensive SAF learning and collaboration platform marks a significant step forward for the corporate travel sector. By providing clear guidance, actionable strategies, and a collaborative environment, it empowers organizations to make informed decisions, overcome adoption challenges, and play a pivotal role in shaping the future of sustainable aviation.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Airline3-FP.jpeg,N,,2025-09-22 13:56:07.805891

About the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore The mission of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) is to grow a safe, vibrant air hub and civil aviation system, making a key contribution to Singapore's success.","CAAS (Amendment) Bill Introduced in Parliament to Implement Sustainable Aviation Fuel

22 September 2025

On 22 September 2025, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) introduced the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) (Amendment) Bill for its First Reading in Parliament. The Bill proposes legislative amendments to the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore Act 2009 to allow for the implementation of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) policies for air transport in Singapore. If passed, the new legislative provisions will empower CAAS to collect a SAF Levy, to set up a SAF Fund, and to procure, manage and allocate SAF and SAF environmental attributes (EAs)1, or establish and appoint a central procurement entity to carry out these functions.

2 In February 2024, CAAS announced as part of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint that it will require flights departing Singapore to use SAF from 2026, with a 1% SAF target for a start, to encourage investment in SAF production and develop an ecosystem for more resilient and affordable supply. The goal is to raise the SAF target beyond 1% in 2026 to 3 – 5% by 2030, subject to global developments and the wider availability and adoption of SAF.

3 The CAAS (Amendment) Bill has three key provisions:

a. First, it provides that a SAF Levy be payable to CAAS in respect of a flight, or passenger or cargo on a flight, that takes off from an airport in Singapore.

The SAF Levy will be introduced in 2026. To provide cost certainty to air transport users, the SAF Levy will be set at a fixed quantum based on the volume of SAF needed to achieve the SAF target and a projected SAF premium2. If the actual final SAF premium differs from projections, the SAF Levy quantum will not change. Instead, the SAF uplift will be adjusted accordingly, resulting in actual volumes that differ from those needed to achieve the SAF target. The SAF Levy quantum will be reviewed from time to time as necessary. The SAF Levy quantum and implementation details will be announced in due course after the Bill is passed.

b. Second, a dedicated SAF Fund will be set up to receive all SAF levies collected.

The Fund will be used to procure SAF and SAF EAs as well as to cover related administrative costs. It will not form part of CAAS’ revenue.

c. Third, the Bill provides for CAAS, or a central procurement entity established by CAAS, to procure, manage and allocate SAF and SAF EAs.

This will enable CAAS to aggregate demand for SAF, achieve economies of scale and provide a cost-effective mechanism for SAF purchases. The implementation details will be announced in due course after the Bill is passed.

4 Singapore adopts a balanced approach to the long term, sustainable growth of Singapore’s aviation sector, taking into account the need for environmental sustainability while ensuring that the Singapore air hub remains competitive. The Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint was developed by CAAS in consultation with industry and other stakeholders. It sets out Singapore’s action plan for the decarbonisation of its aviation sector. Under the Blueprint, CAAS will work with aviation stakeholders to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations3 by 20% from 2019 levels (404ktCO2e) in 2030 and achieve net zero domestic and international aviation emissions4 by 2050. To achieve these goals, 12 initiatives across the airport, airline and air traffic management domains will be rolled out. Additionally, five enablers will be put in place to create the conditions for the effective implementation of these initiatives. This includes building a SAF ecosystem to support the use of SAF in Singapore. The use of SAF is a critical pathway for the decarbonisation of international aviation and is expected to contribute around 65%5 of the carbon emission reduction needed to achieve net zero by 2050.

1 SAF environmental attributes is a value representing the difference in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of SAF throughout its life cycle and those of the same quantity of conventional aviation fuel throughout its life cycle. SAF environmental attributes may be used by a person to meet offsetting requirements applicable to that person under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization or other similar programmes, or reported by a person as carbon emissions reduction from the use of SAF under any scheme applicable to or adopted by that person for the reporting of environmental sustainability efforts undertaken by that person to stakeholders or investors of that person or regulators of the business of that person.

2 The SAF premium is the difference between the price of SAF and the price of conventional jet fuel.

3 These include emissions from the operations of vehicles, facilities and buildings for aircraft, passenger, baggage, and cargo handling at Changi and Seletar airports. It does not include targets for Changi East developments, including Terminal 5, which are not yet operational today. These will be determined separately.

4 These include emissions from international flights operated by Singapore-based operators.

About the GBTA Foundation The mission of the GBTA Foundation, the US 501c3 charitable arm of the Global Business Travel Association, is to help the global business travel industry create a positive impact and better future for people and the planet.","NEW YORK, NY – Air travel remains one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonize—yet it’s essential for global business. And for companies committed to sustainability, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is one of the few viable solutions available to reduce their air travel-related emissions. Corporate travel managers are increasingly driving demand for SAF, however, large-scale adoption has yet to gain momentum.

To address this gap, the GBTA Foundation, the cause-led arm of the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA), today announced the launch of SAF Corporate Connect, the first comprehensive learning and collaboration hub designed specifically to help the corporate travel industry community. The hub equips travel managers and sustainability leaders with the knowledge and tools to understand, evaluate and integrate SAF into their programs.

Developed with the support of the GBTA Sustainability Partners and unveiled during Climate Week NYC, SAF Corporate Connect aims to break down barriers to SAF adoption by offering:

Guidance for corporate travel buyers on SAF purchasing options and integration strategies

Timely market intelligence and up-to-date information on SAF developments

A collaborative forum for peer exchange, knowledge sharing and industry engagement

Carbon emitted during the production of SAF – from raw materials to distribution – can be up to 80% less than conventional jet fuel. When integrated as part of a broader decarbonization strategy that includes influencing travel decisions, monitoring and setting emissions reduction goals, and engaging travel supply chains, SAF can help companies achieve credible travel emissions reductions. And with airlines projecting SAF as a cornerstone of their decarbonization strategies by 2050, the $1.57 trillion global business travel sector holds significant influence in accelerating adoption.

Successfully implementing SAF at scale is a shared investment across the industry. When it comes to the complex world of SAF, corporate travel managers need practical tools to build strong business cases and engage internal stakeholders. SAF Corporate Connect will help companies and industry professionals understand the SAF market, engage suppliers, and communicate progress with credibility. Delphine Millot, Senior Vice President, Advocacy and Sustainability, GBTA, and Managing Director at the GBTA Foundation

Millot also noted GBTA’s ongoing advocacy for clearer reporting standards around SAF purchased via book-and-claim models, and emphasized the initiative’s role in amplifying the voice of corporate travel buyers on SAF-related challenges.

Recent GBTA research highlights the need for greater awareness and support: In the Foundation’s 2024 Sustainability Acceleration Challenge, only 12% of 241 participating companies reported purchasing SAF certificates. In other GBTA studies, travel global managers cite limited budgets, lack of awareness or understanding, and perceived complexity of the purchasing process as key barriers.

By featuring companies with established SAF strategies, SAF Corporate Connect aims to inspire others to chart their own path forward. Alice Ashpitel, Head of Sustainability at Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team, said, Collaboration is essential. By sharing knowledge and experiences, organizations can accelerate their SAF journeys together. Too many businesses hold back due to uncertainty ─ but starting small is not only possible, it’s one of the most powerful ways to build confidence, test solutions and scale impact over time.

“We have carved out a strong local reputation at Missoula Airport, offering the same services as other FBOs and supporting the airlines.","Typically an integral feature of regional and smaller airports, the fixed base operator (FBO) handles business, VIP and, frequently, general aviation traffic. While there is no one size fits all solution, an FBO is often centred around an executive terminal and delivers or coordinates a comprehensive range of aircraft, crew and passenger services.

Many FBOs are owned or franchised to a handful of major chains. Signature Aviation is especially prevalent in the US but with a global presence, for example, and the vivid orange branding of Jetex is also familiar around the world.

Mergers and acquisition take an important role in growing FBO chains, bringing guaranteed service continuity to passengers and crews – and benefits in economies of scale, marketing, training and other operational areas to individual FBOs.

In addition, benefits including training and assistance with marketing and PR are available to FBOs carrying fuel company branding.

Avfuel, Phillips 66 and World Fuel Services are among the fuel suppliers adding their weight to FBOs that might otherwise lack the reach required to explore the wider market.

Customers are reassured by the association with a quality, often heritage brand, and enjoy access to fuel card loyalty schemes and other offers.

And then there are those FBOs choosing to remain part of a smaller, discrete group, opting to join a larger network for deeper market penetration while retaining their individuality, or plumping for full independence.

The latter can be a tough option and these FBOs are frequently part of a much wider co-located aviation ecosystem that involves the full gamut of private aviation and military customers, as well as their regular business aviation trade.

Tailored service philosophy – Custom solutions for independent FBO growth

Northstar Jet (NSJ) is the FBO at Missoula Montana Airport. A Neptune Aviation company, its co-location with the parent organisation is no coincidence.

Neptune operates a fleet of firefighting air tankers and Jamie Jones, Neptune Aviation’s FBO General Manager, explains the symbiotic relationship between the two organisations.

He says: “The FBO connects with our other departments for various needs, providing fuel, hangar space and other standard FBO services. The Neptune Air Attack and Airtanker departments rely on Northstar’s ability to provide these services for their mission readiness.”

Northstar Jet also operates a flight school, the importance of which Jones emphasises, adding: “Our primary focus is to provide flight instruction for the public, but we do see our ability to offer it as a benefit for our employees to obtain their aviation certificates, to become pilots, and get them more culturally integrated into the aviation community.

“The FBO and flight school are springboards into the aviation industry – two of our current Airtanker pilots started on the NSJ line. We have a testing centre built into the flight school, allowing individuals to complete their FAA testing.

“Whether they are becoming an A&P (airframe and propulsion) mechanic, professional pilot, or pursuing a certification as a drone pilot, we can provide those services.”

It is a combination of training services unlikely to be found at a chain FBO, adding significant value to other critical NSJ capabilities, including maintenance, snow clearance and ground service equipment provision, plus regional airline support.

The whole, says Jones, is an ecosystem that enables resilience and growth.

“In the summer, all sectors are busy – firefighting, commercial airlines and general aviation. In fall, winter and spring, the airlines and general aviation slow down, but remain constant, while firefighting slows way down. As we dwindle down to lower activity on our ramp, we continue to provide fuel and see an uptick in transient hangar rental. In the spring, we conduct a lot of training for the air attack and airtanker departments, so we provide the fuel and sometimes de-icing for their training sessions. So part of the season is not as busy, but we are able to stabilise revenue throughout the year.”

A resilient, multi-faceted FBO might be attractive to the chains, but Jones says remaining independent is an intentional choice.

“We have carved out a strong local reputation at Missoula Airport, offering the same services as other FBOs and supporting the airlines. Among the compelling reasons behind the decision to stay independent, we value our ability to follow a tailored service philosophy, our local relationships and flexibility in decision-making.

“There are also important financial considerations. Independence means keeping full control over operations and revenue, where joining a chain often involves sharing profits or meeting performance metrics defined externally.

“We can also be selective in our investment. Rather than adhering to chain-wide infrastructure standards, NSJ can invest precisely where it sees the greatest impact.”

Aviation complex – Banyan Air Service’s independent FBO model at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport

Another staunchly independent FBO, Banyan Air Service has effectively defined its own style of operation.

President and CEO, Don Campion, says: “Banyan is technically an independent FBO, but our operation has grown far beyond what most people associate with that category.

“Unlike a typical standalone facility, Banyan has developed into a full aviation complex at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport, with more than one million square feet of hangar and office space and a wide array of services beyond traditional fuel and line support – including comprehensive maintenance and avionics capabilities, parts distribution, aircraft sales, and one of the world’s largest pilot shops.

“Our business model is centred on vertical integration rather than scale through multiple locations. While international FBO chains achieve consistency by replicating services across airports, and small regional groups benefit from shared resources between a handful of sites, Banyan has focused on building depth at one location. This allows us to offer everything a customer might need – whether transient or based – without leaving the airport.”

Campion founded Banyan in 1979 and has seen plenty of acquisition interest from the major FBO networks.

He has always resisted, saying: “Our independence is central to who we are and how we operate. Remaining privately owned allows us to make decisions quickly, tailor our services to our customers’ needs, and reinvest directly into our facilities and people – without the constraints that can come with corporate oversight.”

Banyan does not work in isolation, however. Campion participates in leadership groups with other FBO executives, including the Pinnacle Group focused on the technical side of FBO operations and an organisation of approximately 20 independent FBOs named f.b.o. #1.

Banyan also carries Avfuel branding, the benefits of which Campion explains as follows.

“Partnering with Avfuel allows Banyan to combine the strengths of a major fuel and service network with the personalised approach of an independent FBO.

“Our customers gain access to competitive fuel programmes, Avfuel’s AVTRIP loyalty points programme, and a seamless experience when travelling between network locations.

“The relationship also provides operational support, training resources and marketing reach that enhance our capabilities without compromising our independence.

“A significant benefit is access to Avfuel’s sustainability initiatives, including sustainable aviation fuel, which helps our customers reduce their environmental impact and align with evolving industry standards for greener operations.”

Sky Valet connect – How Sky Valet connect supports European independent FBO growth

In aviation there is seldom one solution that is right for all, and the FBO market is no exception. Banyan and NSJ have made their unique versions of the independent model work, but many independents seek the support of a formal network without the full-scale corporate tie-in of the major chains. Sky Valet Connect’s Europe-centric network has found its niche delivering exactly that type of support.

Groupe Aéroports de la Côte d’Azur operates Nice Côte d’Azur, Cannes Mandelieu and Golfe de Saint-Tropez airports, while its Sky Valet brand is responsible for FBO services at Cannes and Saint-Tropez.

Jean-François Guitard, Director of General Aviation and Business Development at Aéroports de la Côte d’Azur, describes how the Sky Valet Connect brand subsequently expanded across Europe.

“The large handling companies prefer to serve major or regional airports, where competition between them is fierce,” he says.

“They typically don’t look at smaller independent airports handling business and commercial aircraft, and these lend themselves to being part of a franchised network.

“Most of our Sky Valet Connect franchisees fit this description. They have limited budget for things like marketing but as part of the network they improve their market visibility.

“Sky Valet takes a large booth at the annual EBACE (European Business Aviation Conference and Exhibition) event, for example, where many of our franchisees could afford only a tiny space if they were alone.”

In mid-2025, the Sky Valet Connect brand reached across France, Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Portugal, with new airports joining regularly; four in the first half of 2025 alone.

Guitard expects the trend to continue, since franchisees appreciate the opportunity to remain independent while sharing costs, benefitting from economies of scale, and learning from the experiences and best practices of other network members.

Sky Valet Connect members value their retained independence, while Banyan’s Campion is keen to highlight the importance that customers place on the personalised service an independent FBO provides.

The same is true of NSJ’s customers, and Jones proudly concludes: “Northstar Jet is not just an FBO. We have become a local institution with deep roots in Montana’s aviation ecosystem. Our independent stance is less about resisting change and more about honouring what’s made us successful: personal relationships, high reliability, consistent operations, and a brand that feels genuine – embracing family, firm handshake, and resilient spirit. That makes us genuinely unique in what we do.”",https://www.regionalgateway.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-34.png,N,,2025-09-22 12:57:00.969023

NorthPoint is a pioneering SAF project set to be developed at Ellesmere Port, within the newly designated Origin Green Industrial Zone – a leading hub for industrial decarbonisation in the North West of England.

SAF is a low-carbon alternative to traditional fossil-derived jet fuel that can be produced from sustainable sources, such as non-recyclable residual wastes that would otherwise be incinerated or landfilled. Using SAF reduces CO2 emissions on a lifecycle basis, compared to the fossil-derived jet fuel it replaces. It can also help improve air quality around airports.

Why is it needed?

The UK has a legally binding obligation to achieve ‘net-zero’ carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise, yet the government has set ambitious carbon neutrality targets for domestic aviation (2040) and the aviation sector as a whole (2050).

With air travel demand continuing to grow and no scalable zero-emission alternatives available for short to long-haul flights in the near term, SAF offers the most immediate and practical solution.

NorthPoint will help cut carbon emissions from existing aircraft, build a domestic supply chain for low-carbon fuels, strengthen energy security, and position the UK as a global leader in green aviation.

Even after recycling and energy recovery activities have taken place, the UK deals with millions of tonnes of waste, which currently ends up in landfill or is exported to European countries for incineration.

NorthPoint can utilise this waste as a resource to produce jet fuel with a net greenhouse gas reduction of up to 100%* compared to traditional, fossil-based fuel. NorthPoint fuel is a ‘drop-in’ renewable fuel with zero sulphur and very low levels of particulates, helping to improve local air quality, particularly around airports.

Key facts

Over £2 billion investment in the UK

480,000 tonnes diverted from landfill or incineration each year

Over 500,000 tonnes of CO2 captured

First SAF by 2031.ASTMD 7566 certified

135 million litres per year of SAF

1,500 long-haul flights from London to Sydney offset each year

Why here?

The site was chosen due to its industrial nature, a skilled local workforce and existing refinery infrastructure, including a direct pipeline to Manchester airport, which can be used to transport the SAF to aircraft.

The site also offers the opportunity to link into regional capture projects. This could involve capturing and storing the carbon emitted during the manufacture of SAF, reducing the overall net lifecycle carbon emissions of our fuel by up to 100% and thus creating a carbon- neutral jet fuel.

Benefits to the local community

1000+jobs created during construction

40% of the construction work force to come from within the local community

100+ full-time jobs created once operational

Additional income for Cheshire West and Chester Council through business rates

Supporting local SMEs through the supply chain

Cementing the North West as a pioneer in SAF technology

The technology

Our process for producing SAF follows a non-HEFA-approved pathway and utilises a combination of proven technologies. These processes consist of waste processing to remove recyclables and inorganic materials, conversion of the waste into a synthetic gas or ‘syngas’ via three identical gasification trains (3X), syngas clean-up, fuel synthesis via the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process, and upgrading and purifying the fuel produced into a final product.

This integrated process has been proven in the United States, with the world’s first commercial-scale SAF facility successfully producing low- carbon synthetic crude oil from waste in 2022, utilising a single-train gasification process.

This groundbreaking facility provided invaluable experience and insights into the reliability, operability, and performance of such advanced technology at a full commercial scale. The comprehensive operating data and practical knowledge accumulated during the operation of this facility have been systematically integrated in to the NorthPoint FEL-3 development (FEED), ensuring that the lessons learned are applied effectively.

Advanced Fuel Fund (AFF)

The UK Government has supported the development of the NorthPoint project through the Advanced Fuels Fund in both Window 1, which supported early-stage feasibility and engineering work, and Window 3, which focuses on advancing projects towards construction and commercial deployment. These awards reflect the strong government backing for NorthPoint’s role in delivering UK SAF production capacity, supporting the national SAF mandate, and contributing to net-zero targets through innovation, investment, and job creation.

As Wisconsin farmers gear up for another busy harvest season, Matt Rehberg, Vice President of the Wisconsin Soybean Association, is looking beyond traditional fields and into the skies.

Rehberg recently addressed the Wisconsin Assembly Transportation Committee in support of Assembly Bill 222, legislation promoting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) made from crops such as soybeans. For Rehberg, who farms near Darien with his wife and four children, the cause is deeply personal.

“Our farm may not look like a multi-generation operation on paper,” Rehberg told lawmakers, “but every night we’ve got something going on planting soybeans, raising livestock and teaching our kids what it means to work the land.”

Rehberg stressed the importance of building new, stable markets for Wisconsin-grown soybeans.

“Soybeans are already an incredibly versatile crop - we feed animals, produce food products, keep firefighters free of PFAS with soy firefighting foam, and we make biodiesel. But sustainable aviation fuel is the next frontier,” Rehberg said.

“It has the potential to create a durable, premium market for soybean oil, anchoring more demand right here in Wisconsin.”

A crucial feature of AB 222 is that its tax credit only applies to fuel produced in-state. Rehberg highlighted how this ensures maximum benefit for local communities.

“If a plant is built here, we’re not just creating a new outlet for our soybeans - we’re creating jobs, local tax base and supply chain opportunities for our rural communities,” Rehberg said.

“It keeps the value of what we grow circulating in our state instead of leaving it. What we can control is making sure Wisconsin is competitive when it comes to capturing the next generation of biofuel investment. If we don’t act, other states will, and we’ll be left behind.”

Keep reading for highlights from the interview:

Digital technologies can help maximize existing infrastructure

To meet the increasing demand for energy, the world needs to secure sufficient energy sources. West spoke about:

The need to maximize existing infrastructure

The role of technology in modernizing existing infrastructure such as connected systems for power plants and other industrial facilities

Transition fuels are needed to power the shift to new cleaner sources

Meeting tomorrow’s energy needs requires more than expansion – it demands smarter use of today’s resources. West highlighted:

The importance of transition fuels like liquefied natural gas (LNG)

To support the global energy transition, companies are investing in key parts of the LNG process – from pretreatment and liquefaction to advanced control systems – to deliver reliable, scalable energy solutions.

Innovation is key to meeting future energy demands

Beyond transition fuels, investing in renewable technologies like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and biodiesel is also a priority for meeting future energy needs.

Companies are scaling up efforts globally, with process technologies like Honeywell Ecofining®, which enables the production of SAF that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.i

The industry is preparing for a future where SAF could displace up to 9% of global jet fuel demand by 2035.

During this time, SAF was used exclusively on the Incheon-Haneda route, and the results were more than satisfying.

That is why the airline is now ready to expand the use of SAF in terms of both time and routes. As of this month, SAF will be used for all the flights on two Korea-Japan routes, and this new project is due to continue until the end of 2026.

This will mean a total of 116 flights on the Incheon-Kobe and Gimpo-Osaka routes during the set interval. SAF isn't used in its pure form anywhere in the world, because of current regulations. Only SAF blends, in various proportions, are allowed. Korean Air will use a 1% blend, and the sustainable fuel used in this blend is produced domestically.

SAF is a generic name for several types of alternative jet fuels that are obtained from different resources and through various processes. The SAF used by Korean Air is made from used cooking oil, and is certified under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) introduced by the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO).

At the moment, Korean Air has access to SAF from two suppliers, HD Hyundai Oilbank and GS Caltex. Wide access to a source of SAF, preferably a domestic one, is one of the key aspects for increasing the use of SAF worldwide. As long as it remains scarce and expensive, airlines can't make great progress in terms of sustainability.

Earlier this year, Avina, a clean fuels developer, partnered with Pittsburgh International Airport to build and operate what will be the first on-site SAF production facility in the US. It will be located south of PIT's terminal, and it's expected to roll out more than 100 million gallons of fuel per year. The type of SAF produced here is based on an alcohol-to-jet technology (ATJ).

ATJ, one of the most innovative SAF technologies, uses ethanol or methanol to obtain jet fuel. The resulting fuel is drop-in ready, which means it's certified by ASTM (the American Society for Testing and Materials) as a 100% drop-in replacement fuel. The US Air Force and DARPA have also tested and validated the ATJ-technology SAF.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/korean-air-ramps-up-the-use-of-domestically-produced-sustainable-aviation-fuel-257913_1.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 11:56:50.322710

And for companies committed to sustainability, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is one of the few viable solutions available to reduce their air travel-related emissions. Corporate travel managers are increasingly driving demand for SAF, however, large-scale adoption has yet to gain momentum.

To address this gap, the GBTA Foundation, the cause-led arm of the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA), today announced the launch of SAF Corporate Connect, the first comprehensive learning and collaboration hub designed specifically to help the corporate travel industry community. The hub equips travel managers and sustainability leaders with the knowledge and tools to understand, evaluate and integrate SAF into their programs.

Developed with the support of the GBTA Sustainability Partners and unveiled during Climate Week NYC, SAF Corporate Connect aims to break down barriers to SAF adoption by offering:

Guidance for corporate travel buyers on SAF purchasing options and integration strategies

Timely market intelligence and up-to-date information on SAF developments

A collaborative forum for peer exchange, knowledge sharing and industry engagement

Carbon emitted during the production of SAF – from raw materials to distribution – can be up to 80% less than conventional jet fuel. When integrated as part of a broader decarbonization strategy that includes influencing travel decisions, monitoring and setting emissions reduction goals, and engaging travel supply chains, SAF can help companies achieve credible travel emissions reductions. And with airlines projecting SAF as a cornerstone of their decarbonization strategies by 2050, the $1.57 trillion global business travel sector holds significant influence in accelerating adoption.

Successfully implementing SAF at scale is a shared investment across the industry. When it comes to the complex world of SAF, corporate travel managers need practical tools to build strong business cases and engage internal stakeholders. SAF Corporate Connect will help companies and industry professionals understand the SAF market, engage suppliers, and communicate progress with credibility. Delphine Millot, Senior Vice President, Advocacy and Sustainability, GBTA, and Managing Director at the GBTA Foundation

Millot also noted GBTA’s ongoing advocacy for clearer reporting standards around SAF purchased via book-and-claim models, and emphasized the initiative’s role in amplifying the voice of corporate travel buyers on SAF-related challenges.

Recent GBTA research highlights the need for greater awareness and support: In the Foundation’s 2024 Sustainability Acceleration Challenge, only 12% of 241 participating companies reported purchasing SAF certificates. In other GBTA studies, travel global managers cite limited budgets, lack of awareness or understanding, and perceived complexity of the purchasing process as key barriers.

By featuring companies with established SAF strategies, SAF Corporate Connect aims to inspire others to chart their own path forward. Alice Ashpitel, Head of Sustainability at Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team, said, Collaboration is essential. By sharing knowledge and experiences, organizations can accelerate their SAF journeys together. Too many businesses hold back due to uncertainty ─ but starting small is not only possible, it’s one of the most powerful ways to build confidence, test solutions and scale impact over time.

How will SAF Corporate Connect support organizations looking to reduce emissions from corporate travel programs?

Wizz Air’s Path to Sustainability

The judging panel particularly praised Wizz Air for its substantial advancements in carbon reduction. The airline’s consistent focus on sustainability is clearly reflected in its operations, which include a combination of effective carbon reduction strategies and transparent environmental reporting. In April 2025, Wizz Air presented its ambitious roadmap for achieving Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050. This roadmap aims to reduce its environmental impact through a multi-faceted approach, including fleet renewal, fuel-efficient technologies, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

A key aspect that set Wizz Air apart in the eyes of the judges was its transparent reporting of emissions data. This transparency has built trust within the industry and with passengers, demonstrating the airline’s commitment to not only meeting its sustainability goals but also sharing its progress with the broader aviation community. The airline’s clear and honest approach allows the public to track its journey toward a more sustainable future.

Wizz Air’s investment in fuel-efficient aircraft has also played a crucial role in its success. The airline operates one of the youngest fleets in the world, with more than 70% of its fleet consisting of ultra-efficient Airbus A321neo aircraft. These aircraft, which have an average age of just 4.5 years, are equipped with cutting-edge technologies that further enhance fuel efficiency. These innovations help the airline reduce its environmental footprint while maintaining low operational costs.

“The Sustainability Awards are a testament to the aviation industry’s growing commitment to decarbonisation,” said Victoria Tozer-Pennington, Editor and Co-Founder of Airline Economics. “We are proud to spotlight the companies and individuals who are not only setting ambitious goals but also delivering real results.”

Outstanding Emissions Intensity Reduction

In the financial year 2025, Wizz Air achieved an impressive emissions intensity of 52.2 grams of CO2 per passenger per kilometer. This figure places the airline among the leaders in terms of carbon efficiency in the aviation sector. This achievement is the result of several key initiatives aimed at reducing emissions per flight. These initiatives include the continued operation of its fuel-efficient aircraft, the integration of advanced flight management systems, and the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The airline’s strategy is centered around three major pillars: fleet modernization, fuel innovation, and operational optimization. By focusing on these areas, Wizz Air aims to achieve a 25% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030. One of the most ambitious aspects of its sustainability plan is the goal to power 10% of its flights with SAF by the same year. SAF, which is made from renewable sources, has the potential to significantly reduce the carbon emissions associated with air travel. By investing in SAF, Wizz Air is positioning itself as a leader in the transition to greener aviation.

Dorottya Durucsko, Head of Government Affairs and Sustainability at Wizz Air, said: “We are honored to receive the award of Sustainable Airline of the Year 2025.

Uzbekistan, once regarded as a country with a resource-based energy system and limited opportunities for the adoption of modern technologies, is now becoming a hub for “green” investment and innovation. A strategic partnership with the United States plays a special role in this process, encompassing key areas ranging from energy and ecology to finance, education, and culture. Clean and innovative projects are becoming the hallmark of Uzbek-American relations, shaping a new model of cooperation in the 21st century.

Green Energy and Strategic Partnership

Uzbekistan is moving confidently toward a “green” future. While in 2018 renewable energy sources accounted for less than one percent of electricity generation, from January to July 2025, renewables already provided 20.3% of the country’s total electricity. More than 11 billion kWh of “green” energy were produced, including 6.4 billion kWh from solar power plants and 3.6 billion kWh from wind farms. This volume saved 3.6 billion cubic meters of natural gas and prevented over 2.2 million tons of harmful emissions. Every day, renewables now generate about 26.7 million kWh – enough to cover the needs of 7.28 million households for half a year, or 3.64 million homes for an entire year. Currently, 10 solar and 4 wind plants with a combined capacity of more than 4.5 GW operate across 10 regions of the country.

A key focus of Uzbek-American cooperation has become “green” energy. In 2025, Allied Green Ammonia (AGA), together with the U.S. company Plug Power, announced a major project for the production of sustainable aviation fuel, green diesel, and urea. The plan includes the supply of electrolyzers with a capacity of up to 2 GW for the future complex. A final investment decision is expected by the end of 2025, and the project has already been recognized as one of the flagship initiatives for Central Asia.

Air Products – A Flagship of American Presence

Air Products, a global leader in industrial gases and hydrogen energy, occupies a special place in Uzbek-American cooperation. In the Kashkadarya region, the company participates in a large-scale gas-to-liquids (GTL) project worth around $1 billion. The complex is designed to produce about 1.5 million tons of synthetic fuels per year, including diesel, jet kerosene, and naphtha. Its structure includes air separation units, autothermal reformers, and hydrogen production facilities. This project has become a landmark example of how U.S. technologies are transforming Uzbekistan’s energy sector.

In addition to GTL, Air Products is actively developing industrial gas production in Uzbekistan. The company participates in oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen production projects, introduces the latest PSA units, as well as freezing and storage technologies that reduce food losses and enhance economic resilience. Furthermore, the company has implemented a “green financing” system that links investments to sustainability principles. These projects not only strengthen the country’s industrial potential but also pave the way for positioning Uzbekistan as a regional hub for “green” energy.

The company’s future plans are equally ambitious: production of aviation fuel, CO₂ capture and storage, and coal gasification. Investment volumes exceed several billion dollars, including the construction of a methanol plant with an annual capacity of 1.34 million tons in Bukhara. This transforms Uzbekistan into a future center of high-tech energy in Central Asia, while Air Products becomes a symbol of Uzbek-American partnership.

Investments and Finance

The environmental agenda is closely linked to finance. The Uzbekistan National Investment Fund (UzNIF), with assets worth $1.7 billion, has been entrusted to the management of the U.S. company Franklin Templeton. For the first time in the country’s history, the fund is preparing for an international listing – a symbol of trust in American financial institutions and a new resource for investment in “green” projects.

Agriculture and Ecology: New Horizons of Partnership

Agriculture is one of the key areas of the Uzbek-American partnership, and a striking example is the Silverleafe Agrocluster in the Jizzakh region. This project has become a symbol of the modernization of the country’s agro-industrial complex. U.S. investments have enabled the introduction of precision farming technologies, modern irrigation systems, and innovative John Deere equipment, taking cotton and related crop production to a qualitatively new level.

The cluster has become a model for the transition from outdated practices to a modern agribusiness management system. It applies a track & trace system, allowing products to be monitored from the field to the consumer, significantly increasing transparency and trust in international markets. The adoption of international quality standards and certification has opened access to new export markets and reduced dependence on outdated farming methods.

The project is closely connected with the Agribusiness Development Activity (ADA) and Agricultural Value Chains (AVC) programs. These help farmers expand fruit and vegetable exports, implement quality standards and certifications, and develop greenhouse complexes and intensive orchards. A major result has been a reduction in post-harvest losses and an increase in farm profitability. Thus, the Silverleafe Agrocluster has not only become a catalyst for technological transformation in agriculture but also demonstrated that U.S. investments can deliver tangible effects in sustainable development and the “green” economy.

An equally important area of Uzbek-American cooperation is ecology and waste recycling. A vivid example is the activity of the U.S. company Sayar LLC, which is implementing a large-scale project for medical waste utilization with subsequent thermal energy generation.

Launched in 2024, the project already covers Tashkent, Samarkand, and Bukhara in its first stage, processing up to 6,000 tons of medical waste annually. The generated energy is used to supply hospitals with heating, hot water, and equipment operation. This increases the energy efficiency of social infrastructure while ensuring safe disposal of hazardous waste.

Future plans are even more ambitious: by 2030, recycling capacity will be expanded to 90,000 tons per year, with thermal energy generation reaching 300 GWh annually. The company’s total investment in the project is estimated at around $115 million.

The initiative is unique in that it combines environmental and social dimensions: waste recycling reduces the environmental burden and prevents the spread of infections, while the generated energy provides medical institutions with affordable and eco-friendly resources. Thus, Sayar LLC has become one of the first U.S. companies to demonstrate that waste recycling in Uzbekistan can be not only environmentally justified but also economically viable.

Social Initiatives

The All Children Succeeding (ACS) project, worth $25 million, is aimed at developing inclusive primary education. Healthcare programs include tuberculosis prevention and the One Health initiative, which integrates human, animal, and environmental health. These projects are directly linked to sustainable development, as education and public health form the foundation for introducing innovative “green” initiatives.

Education and Entrepreneurship

The Fulbright and FLEX programs, research initiatives, as well as Ambassador’s Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP) projects, help prepare a new generation of specialists capable of meeting the challenges of the “green” economy.

January 2025 marked an important milestone for fintech development: the U.S. Embassy in Tashkent and OSON Holding (Brio Group) signed a memorandum to launch the Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE). Funding has been allocated to train 25 women entrepreneurs at the Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University. The program covers regions across the country, supporting small and medium-sized businesses in energy, science, and technology. This is already the embassy’s second public-private partnership initiative: in 2024, a memorandum with Air Products was signed to establish a Makerspace in Karshi.

Political and Economic Dialogue

In September 2025, the leaders of Uzbekistan and the United States reaffirmed their commitment to expand the strategic partnership in critical areas – from energy and infrastructure to digitalization and education. Clean investments and innovative projects remain at the heart of this agenda, underscoring that the future of relations is built on the principles of sustainable development.

Conclusion: A Green Future as the Foundation of Strategic Partnership

Uzbekistan and the United States demonstrate that cooperation can cover diverse fields – from “green” energy and industry to education, healthcare, culture, and fintech. Companies such as Air Products, Plug Power, Franklin Templeton, and OSON play a central role in raising bilateral relations to a global level. Together, they are laying the foundation for a new stage of the Uzbek-American partnership – one based on clean energy, the digital economy, and the technologies of the future.

Participants stand a chance to win an exclusive trip with Japan Airlines to Japan, featuring an all-inclusive experience of dining, traveling, and shopping.

The highlight of this journey includes a first-ever collaboration between AIS and Central Group to explore Japan’s comprehensive E-Waste management and recycling ecosystem at DOWA group company that expertise in E-Waste management and recycling as well as a global leader in electronic waste solution while discovering cutting-edge innovations in AI, Green Tech, and Smart Cities, while enjoying immersive cultural and lifestyle experiences in Japan. The campaign runs from now until November 30, 2025, with the trip scheduled for early 2026.

Ms. Saichon Submakudom, Head of Corporate Communication and Public Affairs Business Unit at AIS, said: “Sustainability and environmental stewardship are at the heart of AIS’s operations, particularly in the area of electronic waste management. We are committed to becoming Thailand’s HUB of E-Waste and to addressing this issue in a sustainable way under our mission ‘Thai Say No to E-waste.’ Together with more than 250 public and private sector partners, we have been raising awareness about the impact of E-Waste and providing convenient disposal channels that ensure proper recycling. Since 2020, our collaboration with Central Group has expanded to more than 42 E-Waste drop-off points nationwide, making it easier for people to dispose of E-Waste responsibly. Every piece of E-Waste deposited with AIS is guaranteed to be handled properly—leaving no residue and avoiding landfill—under the Zero E-Waste to Landfill standard, through our partnership with WMS, a member of Japan’s a member of Japan’s DOWA Group, a leader in recycling under the concept to encourage “A Recycling-Oriented World”.

This time, AIS and Central Group are partnering with Japan Airlines (JAL) to support sustainable travel under the ‘Green Journey’ concept, launching this campaign to inspire the public to recognize the importance of disposing of E-Waste correctly so that AIS can manage it responsibly. We hope that in the future, Thailand will achieve concrete and sustainable E-Waste management, creating meaningful changes in public behavior and driving society toward more efficient recycling practices, thereby reducing environmental impact and enhancing quality of life.”

Ms. Achara Wisuttiwongrat, Head of Corporate Marketing, Communication & Sustainability, Central Group, said: “For more than 78 years, Central Group has grown alongside Thai society. Through the ‘Central Tham’ initiative, under the concept of Creating Shared Value (CSV), we are committed to creating jobs, fostering careers, building strong communities, and enhancing quality of life. In particular, on the environmental front, Central Group places strong emphasis on systematic waste management, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, using energy efficiently, and conserving natural resources.

One of our key challenges that we are fully dedicated to is becoming a role model in systematic waste management. We have set a target to reduce landfill waste by at least 30% by 2030, and to achieve zero landfill waste by 2050 through the ‘Love The Earth – ZERO WASTE NOW’ project. This project brings together collaboration from all sectors with the approach of ‘reducing’ unnecessary material use, ‘sorting’ waste at the source, and ‘managing’ it properly to create an effective and sustainable waste management ecosystem. We are also working with key partners such as AIS, Japan Airlines, and WMS to promote the proper disposal of e-waste through the campaign “Record a Clip, Dispose of E-Waste, Fly to Japan for Free!” Currently, Central Group has set up e-waste collection points at more than 42 Central shopping centers nationwide, which has received strong positive response from customers, especially at city-center locations such as centralwOrld.

Central Group believes that sustainability is not the responsibility of any one individual, but a shared mission for everyone. It starts from simple daily actions, such as disposing of waste correctly—because small changes today are the beginning of a better future for us all.”

Mr. Takafumi Sawada, Regional Manager Thailand, Indochina, and the South Asian Subcontinent at Japan Airlines Co., Ltd., said “Japan Airlines is deeply committed to its environmental and social responsibilities, with a strong determination to become one of the world’s most trusted airlines. The company has set a target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 by reducing carbon dioxide emissions and adopting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), produced from used cooking oil during flights. In addition, JAL aims to increase the proportion of SAF usage to 10% by 2030, while modernizing its fleet with new, energy-efficient aircraft such as the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787. At the same time, Japan Airlines follows the 3R+1R principle (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle + Redesign) by eliminating single-use plastics and introducing biodegradable food containers to reduce environmental impact in a tangible way.

To extend its sustainability mission beyond aviation, Japan Airlines, as Japan’s national carrier, has also partnered with Central Group and AIS to provide flight tickets for participants in the campaign “Film Your E-Waste Drop & Fly to Japan for Free!”— offering them the opportunity to visit an E-Waste management facility in Tokyo and learn about safe and effective methods of electronic waste disposal.”

Mr. Yoshihiro Okada, President of WMS (Waste Management Siam – WMS), said: “Our DOWA Group has been an expert in mining and metal smelting for over 140 years. Today, we have shifted our business direction to address the depletion of natural resources by turning E-Waste into a valuable source of raw materials for precious metal extraction. In Thailand, DOWA firmly believes that ‘E-Waste is not waste, but a valuable resource.’ Our goal is to leverage advanced recycling technologies to elevate waste management standards. At the same time, the success of proper electronic waste management requires collaboration from all sectors, along with regulatory frameworks and policies from relevant authorities.

Through our collaboration with AIS, collected E-Waste is sent to ESBEC, a subsidiary of WMS, for dismantling. Most recyclable materials are processed domestically, while non-recyclable components such as mobile phone batteries are safely disposed of through energy recovery incineration. For complex yet highly valuable components, such as printed circuit boards (PCBs) containing multiple precious metals, these are exported to DOWA’s facilities in Japan for advanced recycling processes. As a global leader in resource extraction and circular utilization, DOWA is committed to reintegrating these recovered metals back into industrial processes—helping to build a more sustainable future for both society and the environment.”

Fastmarkets’ research highlights that the world’s 10 largest airlines could see carbon offset costs soar to between 6% and 25% of annual profits if they wait until the compliance deadline to cover their 2024 emissions. By contrast, acting early could limit the burden to just 1–4%.

Looking further ahead, annual obligations could reach 2–10% of profits by 2026, with total Phase 1 costs running as high as 18% of profits for major carriers.

Josh Cowley, Head of Research at Fastmarkets Carbon, said, “The impact on airlines depends on timing of action, as well as underlying airline characteristics, such as profit margin and routes travelled.”

“Airlines with a higher share of long haul routes, older fleets, and limited sustainable aviation fuel use will likely face larger offsetting obligations.”

Carbon credit shortage threatens market stability

Alongside rising costs, airlines face an acute shortage of eligible credits. Fastmarkets estimates that only 15.9 million CORSIA-compliant credits are currently available, against projected demand of 150–175 million tonnes through 2026.

The shortfall stems from bureaucratic delays in host country approvals and insurance requirements, creating what the report describes as a “critical supply bottleneck.” Even under optimistic scenarios, Fastmarkets projects a 2 million credit deficit.

Cowley added, “Supply during Phase 1 has so far been heavily constrained by the need for these approvals.”

“The process for host countries to issue a full corresponding adjustment can be long winded, with many countries still in the early stages of legislating their carbon market frameworks.”

The imbalance is expected to push prices from today’s level of around $22.50 to as much as $45 by 2030.

By 2035, CORSIA could represent a quarter of the entire carbon credit market.

Enforcement uncertainty clouds outlook

A further challenge lies in enforcement.

While the UK and EU have established penalties of £100 and €100 per tonne of CO₂ respectively, major markets including the United States have yet to commit to enforcing CORSIA compliance.

Cowley noted, “Jurisdictions accounting for 50% of Phase 1 demand projections, including the United States, have not signified intent to enforce.”

“This suggests that demand for credits may fall below projections.”

Without stronger and more coordinated regulatory action, Fastmarkets warns that actual demand could lag significantly behind forecasts, raising questions over the scheme’s credibility and long-term stability.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/09/22/boeing-ttbw-green-render-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-22 07:57:14.758851

The emission reduction related to sustainable aviation fuel is allocated to the corporate customer according to a book-and-claim model.

It makes it possible to reduce emissions from flying without the physical delivery of fuel to the customer’s own flight.

Tuomo Karppinen, Finnair’s Head of Environment says: “We want to develop flying in a more sustainable direction and are now taking steps on several different fronts.

“We believe that the most effective solutions can be found at the system level and require cooperation not only between decision-makers and energy producers, but also between airlines and customers.

“With Finnair for Business SAF service, we want to accelerate the adoption of alternative aviation fuel made from renewable raw materials.”

In 2024, approximately 0.5% of the aviation fuel procured by Finnair was SAF. This year, Finnair’s goal is to roughly triple the share compared to last year. Finnair is collaborating, for example, with Neste to accelerate the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel is made from 100% renewable raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste, and its use can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%* over the entire life cycle of the fuel compared to fossil kerosene.

“The environmental benefits of sustainable aviation fuel are significant. However, the aviation fuel we use will not be fully renewable for a long time, since SAF is blended with fossil fuels. But the more we use renewable fuel, the greater the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we will achieve.”

Sustainable aviation fuel is created from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, fat waste and non-food crops, unlike conventional aviation fuel which is made from fossil fuels.
The levy will be set at a fixed quantum based on the volume of sustainable aviation fuel needed to achieve the target and a projected sustainable aviation fuel premium over conventional aviation fuel.
All levies collected will go into a sustainable aviation fuel fund that will be used to procure sustainable aviation fuel or credits for it, and to cover administrative costs.
“This will enable CAAS to aggregate demand for sustainable aviation fuel, achieve economies of scale and provide a cost-effective mechanism for sustainable aviation fuel purchases,” said MOT.","[SINGAPORE] Laws will be amended to implement previously announced policies on sustainable aviation fuel from 2026, including a levy, fund and central procurement, under a Bill tabled on Monday (Sep 22).

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) (Amendment) Bill provides for CAAS to collect a sustainable aviation fuel levy. The quantum will be announced in subsidiary legislation after the Bill is passed, said the Ministry of Transport (MOT).

Sustainable aviation fuel is created from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, fat waste and non-food crops, unlike conventional aviation fuel which is made from fossil fuels.

Policies on its use were announced in February 2024 as part of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, which details the nation’s strategy to achieve net-zero aviation emissions by 2050.

The blueprint sets an interim target of reducing emissions to 80 per cent of pre-pandemic 2019 levels, or 323 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide, by 2030.

In a release on Monday, MOT said sustainable aviation fuel is a “critical pathway” for the decarbonisation of aviation and expected to account for 65 per cent of the carbon reduction required for the 2050 goal.

Levy, fund and procurement

The sustainable aviation fuel levy, which is a tax, must be paid to CAAS for outbound passenger and cargo flights.

As stated in the Bill, the person or entity responsible for paying the levy will be specified in a ministerial order.

Under this order, if the levy is to be passed on to purchasers of an air ticket or those procuring cargo transport services, the amount must be stated in the relevant document such as an air ticket or contract.

The order may also specify penalties or interest on the late payment of the levy.

The levy will be set at a fixed quantum based on the volume of sustainable aviation fuel needed to achieve the target and a projected sustainable aviation fuel premium over conventional aviation fuel.

MOT said that the levy quantum will be reviewed “from time to time as necessary”.

The previously announced target is for sustainable aviation fuel to comprise 1 per cent of all the fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, for a start. By 2030, this will rise to between 3 and 5 per cent.

In 2024, CAAS said that levies for a direct economy-class flight from Singapore would be S$3 to Bangkok, S$6 to Tokyo and S$16 to London.

All levies collected will go into a sustainable aviation fuel fund that will be used to procure sustainable aviation fuel or credits for it, and to cover administrative costs. This will not form part of CAAS’ revenue.

The Bill also provides for the government procurement of sustainable aviation fuel, either by CAAS itself or an entity established by the regulator to procure, manage and allocate sustainable aviation fuel and credits for it.

“This will enable CAAS to aggregate demand for sustainable aviation fuel, achieve economies of scale and provide a cost-effective mechanism for sustainable aviation fuel purchases,” said MOT.

Details on the implementation of procurement will be announced after the Bill is passed, it added.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/e8b2ffad6cc0e4107582114f36b93643883781c8447e908b9c1e43d7fd4f0f3a?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-09-22 06:56:55.559528

Conclusion Hong Kong's aviation sector stands at a crossroads.","Hong Kong's aviation sector, a cornerstone of its global economic identity, faces mounting scrutiny as the city grapples with the dual threats of extreme weather events and geopolitical instability. The recent consideration of a 36-hour closure of Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) due to Super Typhoon Ragasa in September 2025 underscores the fragility of this critical infrastructure. Yet, amid these challenges, a surge in infrastructure investments—most notably the completion of the Three-Runway System (3RS) in November 2024—signals a strategic pivot toward resilience. This analysis examines the economic and market implications of such disruptions, evaluates the role of recent infrastructure upgrades, and assesses their capacity to mitigate risks for investors.

The Economic Toll of a 36-Hour Closure

HKIA, one of the world's busiest cargo airports and a vital hub for regional and international travel, handles an average of 1,100 flights and 190,000 passengers daily Hong Kong airport weighs 36-hour closure as super typhoon nears[ 1 ]. A 36-hour closure, as seen during Typhoon Hato in 2017 and Typhoon Koinu in 2023, would disrupt not only passenger traffic but also the flow of high-value goods, including pharmaceuticals and e-commerce shipments Economic Contribution – AAHK[ 2 ]. According to a report by the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK), the airport contributes approximately 4.6% to Hong Kong's GDP directly and indirectly Hong Kong International Airport – Masterplan 2030 Study[ 3 ]. A prolonged shutdown could therefore translate into immediate GDP contractions, particularly in sectors reliant on air cargo and tourism.

For instance, during the 2019 protests that led to a partial closure of HKIA, the city's GDP contracted by -0.3% in Q2 2019, raising fears of a technical recession Hong Kong’s airport’s closure and its meaning - Rabobank[ 4 ]. Tourism revenue, which accounts for less than 1% of GDP in recent years due to pandemic-related declines, would face further strain as stranded travelers and canceled flights deter visitors Hong Kong’s Tourism Sector Faces Decline[ 5 ]. Cathay Pacific, which operates 45% of flights at HKIA, would bear significant operational costs, compounding losses for airlines and ancillary industries like hospitality and retail Hong Kong airport mulls 36-hour closure due to super typhoon[ 6 ].

Infrastructure Investments: A Shield Against Disruption?

The completion of the Three-Runway System in 2024 represents a $25 billion bet on Hong Kong's aviation future. By enabling simultaneous operations across three runways, the 3RS is projected to increase peak-hour capacity by 50%, easing congestion and reducing delays Hong Kong’s new runway system offers improvements in peak periods[ 7 ]. While the system's primary purpose is to accommodate growing passenger demand—projected to reach 120 million annually—it also enhances operational flexibility during disruptions. For example, during Typhoon Ragasa, the 3RS could allow for staggered flight rescheduling, minimizing the need for a full 36-hour closure.

Complementing the 3RS is the HKIA Logistics Park, a $40 billion initiative aimed at expanding cargo-handling capacity to 10 million tons annually Press Releases, Media Centre - Hong Kong International Airport[ 8 ]. This project, coupled with the development of a logistics hub in Dongguan, strengthens Hong Kong's role in global supply chains, particularly for perishable and time-sensitive goods. Such infrastructure not only mitigates the economic fallout of typhoon-related closures but also positions the city to compete with rivals like Singapore's Changi Airport, which has capitalized on Hong Kong's instability in recent years Hong Kong’s airport shutdown: What it means for business[ 9 ].

Climate Risks and the Cost of Preparedness

The 2025 typhoon closure highlights the escalating financial stakes of climate resilience. A 36-hour shutdown could cost tens of millions in lost revenue, as seen during Typhoon Koinu in 2023, when over 10,000 travelers were stranded Typhoon Koinu stranded 10,000 travelers in 2023[ 10 ]. However, proactive measures—such as rescheduling long-haul flights and relocating aircraft—demonstrate improved preparedness. The AAHK's investment in AI-driven weather forecasting and real-time operational adjustments further reduces the likelihood of prolonged closures Powering Hong Kong’s Green Skies[ 11 ].

For investors, the key question is whether these upgrades justify the capital outlay. The 3RS, for instance, was completed on time and within budget, earning recognition as a “Prestigious Infrastructure Project” Prestigious Infrastructure Project in Hong Kong[ 12 ]. Meanwhile, Cathay Pacific's $100 billion investment in fleet modernization and customer experience underscores the airline's confidence in Hong Kong's long-term viability as an aviation hub Cathay is investing over HK$100 billion[ 13 ].

Market Implications and Investment Opportunities

The interplay between infrastructure resilience and economic vulnerability presents a nuanced outlook for investors. While short-term disruptions like typhoon closures pose risks, the city's strategic investments in aviation infrastructure offer long-term upside. The Three-Runway System, for example, is expected to attract new airline routes and cargo operators, boosting non-aviation revenue streams such as retail and logistics services Economic Contribution - Hong Kong International Airport[ 14 ].

However, challenges remain. Hong Kong's GDP growth is projected to expand by a modest 1.9% in 2025, constrained by global trade protectionism and geopolitical tensions Hong Kong, China: Navigating Growth Challenges[ 15 ]. Investors must weigh these macroeconomic headwinds against the potential returns from infrastructure-linked sectors. For instance, companies involved in airport technology, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) infrastructure, and logistics automation could benefit from the AAHK's green initiatives and cargo expansion plans Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) infrastructure[ 16 ].

Conclusion

Hong Kong's aviation sector stands at a crossroads. While the 36-hour closure of HKIA during Typhoon Ragasa highlights the city's vulnerability to extreme weather, the completion of the Three-Runway System and logistics park investments signal a commitment to resilience. For investors, the path forward lies in balancing short-term risks with long-term opportunities. As global supply chains evolve and climate risks intensify, Hong Kong's ability to adapt its infrastructure will determine not only its economic stability but also its position as a premier aviation hub in the Indo-Pacific region.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd3fc8a94bc002.png,N,,2025-09-22 06:56:59.636868

What are the main challenges in the global aviation market?
ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, Insurance) service providers like us play a key role here, as we can provide the extra capacity needed at short notice during peak season.
Our aircraft maintenance subsidiary, FL Technic,s also repairs third-party aircraft, and we provide training for the crews and pilots of many airlines.
An external consultancy has estimated that the global ACMI market is worth $30 billion (€25.5 billion) and will need 1,500 aircraft to operate.","This year's season has been very challenging for airlines and passengers in Europe. Strikes by ground staff, pilots and flight controllers thwarted holiday plans for many travellers and exposed carriers to losses.

But experts say these aren't the only challenges airlines have faced this year.

""In our industry, strikes are quite common. We run 15 branches of our Aviator ground handling business in Scandinavia, and in fact, there has not been a single year when we have not had major challenges in terms of strikes,"" says Gediminas Žiemelis, CEO of Avia Solutions Group.

He points out that there are many more challenges facing the industry. Among the most important, he says, are the closure of airspace over Ukraine and Israel, which affects airspace congestion and lengthens flights on some routes, unexpected technical problems related to new-generation engines, and the long-term effects of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The two major aircraft manufacturers, Boeing and Airbus, have struggled with the production of planes since the pandemic. Around 3,4000 narrow-body and 1,200 wide-body aircraft haven't been built.

""This means that airlines are extending the life of the current fleet, using aircraft two to three years longer because they need to handle the current record traffic. Airline capacity is lower than pre-pandemic forecasts, and demand has already caught up,"" Žiemelis says.

""Overall: record traffic, shortage of aircraft, deferred deliveries, unforeseen problems with new technology engines. These are the main problems in aviation today.""

Read the full text of the interview with the CEO of Avia Solutions Group below:

Euronews: The past holiday season was marked by strikes in the aviation industry. Ground staff, pilots and air traffic controllers protested. How did this affect the industry and business prospects?

Gediminas Žiemelis, CEO of Avia Solutions Group: These problems occur every year, so everyone is adapting to them and getting better at dealing with them. Ideally, it would be possible to minimise them in order to reduce the inconvenience for passengers.

However, everyone is preparing for this eventuality. Air traffic is growing exponentially, so the outlook is very positive.

What condition is the aviation industry in at the moment?

Aviation is a vital part of the global economy, and nothing demonstrates this better than the industry's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

As a result of the pandemic, air traffic worldwide fell by 66 per cent in 2020 compared to 2019, but the market has since seen a strong recovery. According to IATA, air traffic is expected to reach 5.2 billion passengers in 2025, an increase of 6.7 per cent compared to 2024. This shows that there is still huge potential for growth and expansion in all aspects of the market.

This exponential growth trajectory and the clear need to increase the supply of aircraft to meet growing demand make the industry very attractive to investors today. For example, Air Lease Corporation, a large lessor, has just been bought by a consortium led by SMBC Aviation Capital for around $7.4 billion (€6.3 billion).

Do EU regulations make it more difficult for carriers to operate in the European market?

Aviation is a highly regulated industry worldwide, and for good reason, as the safety of operations is absolutely crucial. In terms of regulation, the EU is no different to any other jurisdiction we operate in.

I also believe that the EU's SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) regulations are an overall positive piece of legislation, as they call for increased production of cleaner fuels.

What about regulations on minimum hand luggage sizes? There has been talk this year that this issue may be regulated at the EU level.

If it is regulated, it would be worth buying shares in suitcase manufacturers. And seriously, many low-cost airlines are able to offer cheaper tickets by charging for additional services such as baggage.

So if a ban were to be introduced, this could actually increase the average ticket price.

What are the main challenges in the global aviation market?

The challenge has been known for a long time. Airbus and Boeing are not able to deliver enough new aircraft. While I expect this problem to be solved by the end of the decade, with the rapid growth in air traffic, airlines need more aircraft to meet demand.

ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, Insurance) service providers like us play a key role here, as we can provide the extra capacity needed at short notice during peak season. This benefits the airlines in many ways, but in a market context, it is particularly important that by working with us, they do not have to lease or buy available mid-life aircraft on a long-term basis.

They receive the assets when they need them and then return them when they are no longer needed. This is more beneficial for their balance sheet.

What does this mean for airlines?

Airlines can either own the aircraft, lease them long-term - for about five to seven years - or use a full-service ACMI lease for a shorter period - usually about six months.

Our business is predominantly ACMI-based and is essentially about providing airlines with short-term capacity during the peak season, usually during the summer in a particular region when demand for holiday travel is at its highest.

Most airlines generate the majority of their revenue just in the summer, so having the entire fleet on a long-term basis means that they will continue to pay for assets that are not optimally utilised. ACMI is a fleet management tool that solves this problem.

Our rule of thumb is that by choosing ACMI for up to 10 per cent of the total fleet for a maximum of six months, airlines can increase their profitability by around 2-3 per cent.

What are Avia Solutions Group's expansion and growth plans?

Our strategy is to increase our global reach. The reason why it is so important for us to have a global presence is precisely because of seasonality.

In Europe, which is the traditional market for ACMI, when the summer ends and demand for our products falls, in the southern hemisphere, the peak season, i.e. summer and school holidays, begins.

Therefore, by investing in the establishment of new airlines in places such as Indonesia, Thailand, Brazil and Mexico, we have ensured that we have the right foundation for the counter-cyclical model. Essentially, having a global presence means that we can move our fleet to where demand for our services is highest.

For example, we recently opened a service centre in the Philippines that will provide end-to-end remote workforce solutions to our subsidiaries around the world as part of this strategic global expansion. This new centre will also help us attract talent to the Group in Asia, where we are growing rapidly.

What are your plans for Poland and the Central and Eastern European region?

We plan to open a SAF and eSAF (synthetic jet fuel) plant in Latvia in 2030, which, once operational, will be the largest facility of its kind in Northern Europe. Demand for SAF will increase significantly over the next few years, especially given the EU requirements for its use.

I also believe that it is important that Europe is able to produce its own SAF for energy sovereignty reasons.

Poland itself is a rapidly growing aviation market where I expect demand for our services to increase. The figures clearly show this upward trend. In 2024, Poland will see significant growth, serving 59.5 million passengers, an increase of 15.6 per cent compared to 2023 and 22 per cent compared to 2019.

Who are your main competitors?

We are by far the largest ACMI provider in the world with a fleet of 209 aircraft, but we are also an air services group. I don't think of competitors because I see everyone as potential customers or partners.

Other lessors that offer long-term leasing are our partners because we lease some of our aircraft from them, and airports are also customers of our ground handling subsidiaries. Our aircraft maintenance subsidiary, FL Technic,s also repairs third-party aircraft, and we provide training for the crews and pilots of many airlines.

I and the entire group are focused on providing this range of best-in-class services to as many customers and partners as possible.

What are Avia's long-term business goals?

To continue our global expansion and grow our fleet to more than 700 aircraft over the next few years. An external consultancy has estimated that the global ACMI market is worth $30 billion (€25.5 billion) and will need 1,500 aircraft to operate.

We currently have 209 aircraft, so just in the provision of ACMI services, we have huge growth potential.

Last year, Avia Solutions Group ordered 80 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Could you say how this order fits into the company's broader strategic vision?

One of the reasons we are investing in the SAF production facility is the need to progressively make aviation greener. The order of the new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft fits into this strategy, as it means we can offer our customers the most modern and fuel-efficient aircraft.

More broadly, this is part of our plans to further develop and expand ACMI's business.

Certares and Impact Investment have invested in Avia. What is the capital structure currently like?

I am very proud that Certares, a US private equity firm, invested €300 million in the Group in 2021 and then decided to convert this amount into a 20 per cent equity stake last year. Equally beneficial is having Mike Pompeo as a strategic advisor.

The successful listing of our $300 million (€255 million) unsecured senior notes on Euronext Dublin in early 2024 was another clear demonstration of investor confidence in our Group and our long-term growth strategy.

I now personally own approximately 60 per cent of the Group, with the remainder held by other shareholders, including Certares.

You were listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, but then delisted. Why and are there any plans for the stock exchange in the future?

Increasingly, they are measured by carbon intensity, sustainability, and their alignment with international climate agendas. For Egypt, this reality is shaping a new chapter in its petrochemical sector, where diversification into bioethanol, green ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is as much a strategic decision as it is an economic one.

Energy as Diplomacy

The global demand for cleaner fuels has created a new playing field. Europe’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and international airline emissions standards are not just technical regulations; they are political levers that determine who gains access to lucrative markets. For Egypt, maintaining its role as a trusted energy partner requires adapting quickly to these shifts. By investing in next-generation fuels, the country is sending a message to both regional neighbors and global buyers: Egypt intends to remain relevant, competitive, and aligned with the net-zero future. This political dimension is not lost on policymakers. As one senior official put it, “Green fuels are our new passport to global trade. Without them, we risk being locked out of tomorrow’s markets.”

Green Ammonia: Strategic Leverage

Ammonia has long been central to Egypt’s petrochemical production, primarily for fertilizer exports. Transitioning to green ammonia, produced from renewable hydrogen, is more than an industrial upgrade—it is a geopolitical tool. Europe and Asia are positioning ammonia as a hydrogen carrier and maritime fuel of the future. By producing and exporting green ammonia, Egypt can secure influence in these emerging supply chains while leveraging its strategic location between continents.

The project in Damietta, for example, is being developed with a clear eye toward export markets, offering Egypt a foothold in one of the most contested areas of global energy diplomacy. The landmark green ammonia facility has an annual Production of 150,000 tons of green ammonia with overall investments of $890 million.In a region where Gulf states are investing heavily in hydrogen and ammonia, Egypt’s entry ensures it is not sidelined in this critical competition.

Agriculture and Energy Security

Bioethanol offers another avenue, rooted in Egypt’s agricultural wealth. By converting sugarcane byproducts and crop residues into fuel ethanol, Egypt can simultaneously advance energy security, create rural jobs, and reduce environmental pressures from agricultural waste. Politically, this integration of agriculture and energy resonates with Egypt’s development strategy: aligning local economic growth with sustainability and social equity.

At a time when food and fuel security are increasingly intertwined in global negotiations, bioethanol gives Egypt a dual advantage: strengthening domestic resilience while offering an export product compatible with international blending mandates.

Aviation Matters

The aviation sector presents perhaps the most politically charged opportunity. With airlines under growing pressure to cut emissions, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as a compliance tool for meeting international climate agreements. Egypt’s planned SAF facility positions the country not only as a regional pioneer but also as a partner in Europe’s decarbonization agenda.The facility is expected to cut CO₂ emissions by up to 400,000 tons per year

This matters politically: aviation is tied to tourism, trade, and diplomacy. By supplying SAF, Egypt strengthens its integration into global air transport networks while bolstering its own aviation industry. In effect, SAF is not just a fuel. It is a geopolitical asset that ties Egypt more closely to global mobility systems.

Challenges of high costs and competition

Still, Egypt’s diversification into green fuels is not without hurdles. Production costs remain high, technologies require significant investment, and competition from regional players is intense. Yet these challenges underscore why Egypt’s strategy is fundamentally political: to attract international financing, secure partnerships, and shape narratives about Egypt as a sustainable energy hub.

If Egypt succeeds, the payoff will extend beyond economics. It will reinforce the country’s energy diplomacy, enhance its negotiating power with Europe and Asia, and diversify its export portfolio at a time when traditional hydrocarbons face declining political currency.

In many ways, Egypt’s push into bioethanol, green ammonia, and SAF reflects a broader balancing act: between old and new markets, between hydrocarbons and clean fuels, and between national interests and international obligations. As the global energy map is redrawn, Egypt is ensuring it has a seat at the table, not only as a gas hub in the East Mediterranean, but as a regional leader in petrochemicals especially low-carbon fuels.

For Egypt, the calculation is clear: in a world where energy is diplomacy, green fuels are the next instrument of statecraft. By embracing this shift, Egypt is not merely adapting to external pressures. Egypt is positioning itself as a decisive actor in the politics of the energy transition.",https://egyptoil-gas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/04Websit_Issue_September25.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 06:57:24.981512

After a period of normalization, new headwinds including rising costs, shifting company priorities and sustainability considerations present potential turbulence, according to Deloitte’s ‘2025 Corporate Travel Report’.

Kate Ferrara, vice chair and U.S. transportation, hospitality and services sector leader, Deloitte said: “Corporate travel continues to be important to business and employee growth, but companies are facing potential turbulence as they adapt to conditions like rising costs and shifting internal priorities. This moment calls for agility and partnership between companies and their travel providers, as well as companies and their traveling employees. Understanding the goals of each trip and helping ensure the trip provides a strong return on investment is key. Meanwhile, providers who consider organizations’ travel priorities and are ready to adapt their offerings to offer the most value can be positioned to succeed long term.”

Eileen Crowley, U.S. transportation, hospitality and services leader, Deloitte said: “Cost considerations and sustainability measures may be charting the course for many organizations. Sustainable travel priorities are changing as many companies are no longer just measuring suppliers’ impact efforts; they are making business decisions based on them. This creates an opportunity for travel providers who understand which metrics matter most. Those who are willing to be transparent and adaptable can help ensure a smooth trajectory.”

Company travel spend holds steady, but changes are on the horizon: 3 in 4 (74%) travel managers surveyed plan to expand budgets this year (similar to 2024), but fewer (68%) expect to do so for 2026. However, the share of travel managers expecting budget cuts is up (+4%).

Events and training and development drive travel demand: Two-thirds of travelers surveyed have or expect to travel for a live event, while nearly half (49%) either have or expect to travel for training this year.

Costs are top-of-mind, as 54% of travel managers surveyed say cost is one of the top factors restricting travel this year.

Forty-nine percent of business travelers surveyed say they always use corporate booking tools, and 60% of travel managers say their companies are increasing compliance with the prescribed booking process to control costs.

Sustainability management is becoming more actionable, as more online booking tools shift from simply tracking travel providers’ sustainability measures to providing functionality that offers recommendations.

Why this matters

The corporate travel market is growing moderately, but complexity abounds. Though budgets may be increasing, so are costs. At the same time, success and sustainability markers are getting increasingly complicated to measure as companies reevaluate travel’s primary benefits, potentially changing the course for their broader strategy. In 2025, the proportion of professionals traveling for work declined from 36% in 2024 to 31% in 2025. At the same time, the composition of business travelers is shifting: occasional travelers are becoming regulars, regular travelers are moving up to frequent status, while seasoned road warriors are scaling back their travel. In its new report, “Forecast in Flux: 2025 Deloitte Corporate Travel Survey,” Deloitte examines what is shaping the corporate travel landscape and what that means for travelers, their companies and travel providers alike.

Corporate travel navigates a complicated trajectory

After signs of normalization last year, shifting conditions have complicated corporate travel’s continued ascent. While the majority of companies continue to increase their travel spend, pullbacks have become more widespread, especially among larger companies.

Annual budgets are increasing, for now: 3 in 4 travel managers surveyed (74%) report expanding budgets this year, similar to 2024 (73%). However, the share anticipating budget cuts is up from 6% to 10%, and they expect their budgets to shrink by an average of 28%. Looking ahead, fewer travel managers expect to raise budgets for 2026 (68%), and 9% anticipate cuts.

Larger companies anticipate a greater impact, as only 59% surveyed expect increases in their travel budgets — a sharp contrast to smaller companies (80%) who plan to spend more. This counters 2024 trends when larger companies were more likely to expect budget growth.

Surveyed travelers generally expect to travel more than in 2024. However, frequent travelers (10 or more trips per year) expect to reduce their trips. Just 53% expect to travel three or more times per month, down from 63%.

Among those who allocate travel budgets, 16% expect their teams to travel less this year, up from 9% in 2024.

Live events, training drive travel demand

While face-to-face connections with clients continue to be the largest driver of corporate travel, travel to connect with internal stakeholders for training and development is taking off.

Live events remain a major universal driver of business travel, as nearly two-thirds (65%) of business travelers surveyed expect to attend a conference this year.

Employee training is now on-par with business development as a catalyst for travel. While new business initiatives remain the top driver (52%), training and development jumped to second place (47%), underscoring how new technology is spurring a need for upskilling of internal teams. Other top drivers include in-person engagement with clients and partners (45%) and conferences (42%).

Further emphasizing the growing role of training and development, 1 in 5 (20%) travel managers cite it as their companies’ top driver of travel growth in 2025, and nearly half (49%) of corporate travelers already have or expect to travel for training in 2025, up from 45% last year.

Costs create headwinds for return on travel investment

Amid rising costs and shifting preferences, organizations are focused more on ensuring that travel brings strong return on investments. The considerations for what generates strong ROI, however, is shifting.

Fifty-four percent of travel managers surveyed say cost is among the top three factors restricting travel, up from 48% in 2024.

To manage costs, more companies are targeting hotel rates: Travel providers surveyed say they are encouraging travelers to choose less expensive lodging options (50%) rather than lower cost of airfares (37%).

International trips account for about half (54%) of respondents’ spend, similar to 2024, but destination mix continues to shift as pandemic-era restrictions lift and other considerations factor into decisions.

Corporate booking tools remain an effective cost-control measure, and booking compliance remains similar to 2024 (42%). Frequent travelers have become even more compliant (49% of respondents in 2025 planned to use corporate channels exclusively vs. 43% in 2024).

For those not using corporate channels, online travel agency (OTA) booking has declined among those surveyed, especially among air travel bookers, down to 49% from 57% in 2024. Responses indicate that user experience is playing a part: The share of those surveyed who say they use an OTA due to a superior shopping experience went from 46% in 2024 to 27% in 2025.

Most respondents say their companies still make pre-trip assessments of each trip’s justifiability (54%) and prioritize trips that could lead to specific business outcomes (58%), but these approaches are trending down (compared to 66% and 75%, respectively, in 2024). Meanwhile, the share of respondents whose companies regularly evaluate travel strategy at the highest levels is up slightly.

Sustainability initiatives keep their course

Sustainability and environmental impact also shape corporate travel plans. Organizations are increasingly moving from simply monitoring their suppliers’ efforts to actively recommending based on factors such as emissions, certifications and chainwide standards.

Nearly half (48%) of travel managers surveyed say their companies are optimizing business travel practices to mitigate environmental impact, similar to 2024.

Reducing impact isn’t just about reducing travel, as some prioritize suppliers with sustainable practices: The share of travel managers prioritizing airlines that use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) jumped 10%, from 33% in 2024 to 43% this year.

Fewer companies are tracking suppliers’ sustainability metrics. For aviation, those tracking the use of SAFs went from 48% in 2024 to 25% in 2025, and those tracking carbon emissions per flight went from 38% to 30%. For hospitality providers, less organizations are tracking sustainability certifications and ratings (52% in 2024 vs. 30% in 2025) and chainwide standards (35% in 2024 vs. 26% in 2025).

More travel buyers report information on SAFs, emissions and certifications are flagged in booking tools. Most notable, 41% said booking tools flagged use of SAFs, and 42% said the tool flagged carbon emissions per flight. On the hospitality side, 40% of surveyed travel buyers said booking tools flagged sustainability certifications and ratings.

Deloitte’s “2025 Corporate Travel Report” is based on two surveys. The first surveyed 151 U.S.-based corporate travel managers between July 10 and July 23, 2025, who are tasked with company-wide travel initiatives including employee-oriented policy, supplier negotiations, duty of care, and the procurement of booking technology. The second surveyed 1,003 U.S.-based corporate travelers who took a business trip in 2024 and also traveled in 2025, fielded from July 3 to July 12, 2025. Among those corporate travelers, 215 qualified as budget owners, leaders who make travel decisions for teams or business units.

From August last year to the end of August this year, Korean Air applied domestic SAF produced by domestic refineries to commercial routes from Korea (Incheon to Haneda).","Korean Air announced on the 22nd that it will expand its routes using domestic Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The flights that apply domestic SAF this time are KE731 from Incheon to Kobe, Japan, and KE2117 from Gimpo to Osaka, Japan. From September 19 this year to December 31 next year, 1% of the total aviation oil for the flight will be filled with domestic SAF for about a year and four months.

HD Hyundai Oilbank will supply Incheon-Kobe routes and domestic SAF produced by GS Caltex will supply Gimpo-Osaka routes, respectively. HD Hyundai Oilbank, in particular, exported SAF to Japan in June last year and entered the domestic market for the first time with this supply. Both SAFs produced by the two companies used UCO (Used Cooking Oil) and were certified by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as the CORSIA.

Through this supply, we plan to strengthen our strategic relationship with Korean Air, the largest airline in Korea, and further solidify our position in the SAF market, said an official at HD Hyundai Oilbank.

SAF is an aviation oil made from eco-friendly raw materials such as waste, animal and vegetable oils, and agricultural by-products. Carbon emissions can be reduced by up to 80% over the entire production process compared to regular aviation oil. It can be mixed up to 50% in existing aviation oil without a separate aircraft modification.

From August last year to the end of August this year, Korean Air applied domestic SAF produced by domestic refineries to commercial routes from Korea (Incheon to Haneda). After proving the safety and performance of domestic SAF through actual operation for a year, it has expanded its use to other routes this time.

Starting in 2027, SAF mixing obligations will be implemented on all aircraft departing from Korea. The mixed obligation ratio is expected to gradually expand to 1% in 2027, 3-5% in 2030, and 7-10% in 2035.

However, the SAF price is about twice that of general aviation oil, and the cost burden on the aviation industry is inevitable. According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, Korean Air is expected to incur additional costs of 40 billion won to 45 billion won per year on a 1% application basis.

An official of Korean Air said, ""It is true that the cost burden is increasing, but we plan to continue our decarbonization to participate in the carbon neutral trend of the global aviation industry.""",https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202509/22/news-p.v1.20250922.4ea2b010e4dc4c8195718486690e1f48_P1.png,N,,2025-09-22 06:57:52.836614

This move is not just a step towards reducing the airline’s carbon footprint, but also part of a broader effort by Korean Air and the aviation industry at large to embrace alternative fuels as a long-term solution to curb emissions from air travel. The fuel, which is derived from used cooking oil, is sourced from two major domestic suppliers, HD Hyundai Oilbank and GS Caltex.

The Rise of SAF in Air Travel

The airline’s adoption of SAF highlights a growing trend in the aviation industry towards more sustainable practices. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is increasingly being recognized as one of the most viable solutions for reducing the carbon emissions from the aviation sector, which is notorious for its environmental impact. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF is produced using renewable resources, such as waste oils, plant material, and other biomass sources, which can significantly lower carbon emissions.

Korean Air’s expanded use of SAF is part of a larger movement within the aviation industry, where numerous airlines are now investing in SAF production to meet long-term fuel demands. In addition to Korean Air, several major international carriers, including American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, and International Airlines Group (IAG), have joined forces to establish an investment fund aimed at scaling SAF production. With more than $150 million raised, the fund’s goal is to increase the availability of SAF by supporting the growth of alternative fuel markets and supply chains.

Key Benefits of SAF for the Aviation Industry

The use of SAF in aviation offers numerous environmental and economic benefits. Firstly, SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel, depending on its composition and the production process. This reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for the airline industry’s efforts to meet its environmental targets, which include achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

In addition to the environmental benefits, SAF can also help airlines hedge against the volatile prices of traditional fossil fuels. With its renewable nature, SAF offers airlines a more stable long-term fuel source, which can help manage operational costs. Moreover, as SAF production scales up, the costs associated with it are expected to decrease, making it a more affordable option for airlines globally.

What Should Travelers Do?

For travelers flying between South Korea and Japan, the use of SAF on more flights presents an exciting opportunity to contribute to environmental sustainability. While the fuel blend may be a small percentage of the total fuel mix used on flights, it signifies a commitment to reducing the carbon footprint of air travel. Travelers who are passionate about sustainable travel can support airlines that are actively investing in SAF and other green technologies.

Moreover, travelers can also consider other eco-friendly practices while flying, such as choosing flights with lower emissions, offsetting their carbon footprint, and supporting airlines that offer sustainability-focused travel options.

Future of SAF and Sustainable Air Travel

The use of SAF is expected to grow substantially over the next decade, especially as airlines increase their commitments to sustainable practices. With support from government incentives and industry collaborations, SAF is poised to become a significant part of the aviation industry’s effort to decarbonize. As SAF production expands and the technology improves, its price will continue to drop, making it a more accessible option for airlines worldwide.

In the coming years, more airlines will likely follow the example set by Korean Air, incorporating SAF into their operations to meet sustainability goals and reduce their carbon footprints. This shift is expected to benefit not only the aviation industry but also global tourism, as it aligns with the growing demand for sustainable travel options. As the world moves toward more sustainable travel practices, these advancements in fuel technology will help travelers explore the globe while minimizing their environmental impact.

Impact on Tourism and the Environment

Sustainable aviation fuel not only contributes to reducing the aviation industry’s carbon emissions but also offers significant benefits for tourism. As airlines embrace SAF, the sector as a whole will be better equipped to meet the increasing demand for environmentally responsible travel options. This, in turn, could attract eco-conscious travelers who are looking for ways to minimize their environmental impact while exploring new destinations.

Moreover, SAF’s impact extends beyond just the airlines and passengers. Communities near airports and along flight routes will benefit from a decrease in air pollution, resulting in cleaner air and healthier environments. As more destinations embrace sustainable tourism practices, SAF could become a key component of the eco-tourism experience, making travel more sustainable without sacrificing convenience or comfort.

Expanding the Scope of SAF in the Aviation Industry

Korean Air’s commitment to SAF on its Japan routes is just one example of how the airline is embracing sustainable aviation fuel. With the increasing demand for greener technologies, the airline has set its sights on scaling its SAF operations and potentially expanding its use to more regions. In the coming years, the aviation industry is expected to witness a significant rise in the adoption of SAF, particularly as more suppliers and fuel producers enter the market.

As the world’s major airlines unite under a common goal of reducing carbon emissions, the aviation industry’s transition to SAF could serve as a model for other sectors aiming to mitigate their environmental impact. With further investments in fuel production and the growing demand for sustainable travel options, the future of SAF looks bright for both airlines and passengers alike.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Korean-Air-13.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 02:56:09.402448

Could Quad-Jets Return If Sustainable Aviation Fuel Is Cheaper?
Whether for political necessity, technological innovation, or heavy-lift cargo, quadjets could still serve as outliers in a twinjet-dominated world.","For much of the recent jet-age, four-engine passenger aircraft, such as the Boeing 747, Airbus A340, and Airbus A380, embodied the pinnacle of long-haul travel. With their vast capacity, range, and redundancy, these quadjets once dominated the world’s busiest and most prestigious routes, becoming icons of aviation history. They were born in an era when engine reliability and regulations demanded more than two engines for flights across oceans and remote regions, making them both practical and symbolic of global air travel.

In recent years, however, the industry has shifted decisively toward twin-engine aircraft. Advances in engine technology and expanded ETOPS certifications have made twinjets like the Boeing 777, 787, Airbus A350 and A330 more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable than their four-engine predecessors. With Airbus ending A380 production in 2021 and Boeing delivering its final 747 in 2023, the era of quadjets appears to have passed; yet, questions remain about whether unique geopolitical pressures, future supersonic designs, or new propulsion technologies could someday bring them back.

From Icons to Obsolescence: The Rise and Fall of Quadjets

When long-haul air travel expanded in the 1960s and 70s, four engines were essential. Jets like the Boeing 747 and 707, and later the Airbus A340 and A380, offered the thrust, range, and redundancy needed to cross oceans safely at a time when twin-engine reliability was limited. These aircraft became the flagships of global fleets, built to carry hundreds of passengers across continents.

They also became cultural icons. The 747, known as the “Queen of the Skies,” symbolized globalization, while the A380 showcased Airbus’s ambition to reshape hub-to-hub travel with unmatched capacity. For airlines, flying a quadjet was as much about prestige as practicality.

Yet their size and complexity came at a cost. Four engines meant more fuel burn and higher maintenance, disadvantages that grew as new, efficient twinjets entered service. By the 2010s, the A340 had been retired from production, the A380 saw dwindling orders, and in 2023, Boeing closed the 747 line, marking the end of the quadjet era in mainstream passenger aviation.

Why Twin-Engine Aircraft Took Over the Skies

The dominance of four-engine airliners began to falter as jet engines became more powerful and reliable. Advances in turbofan technology meant that two engines could provide the thrust once requiring four, while also burning less fuel and weighing less. Regulatory changes reinforced this shift; ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) allowed twinjets to operate safely on long transoceanic routes once off-limits to them.

Aircraft such as the Boeing 777, 787 Dreamliner, Airbus A350 and A330 have capitalized on these developments, offering airlines a balance of range, efficiency, and lower operating costs. For carriers, this meant the ability to open new point-to-point routes without relying solely on megahubs that favoured very large aircraft. The flexibility and profitability of twins quickly overshadowed the appeal of quadjets.

The numbers tell the story: while the A340 and A380 struggled to attract new orders, airlines eagerly adopted twinjets for both long-haul and ultra-long-haul operations. With fewer engines to maintain, lower fuel bills, and strong manufacturer support, two-engine aircraft proved to be the more sustainable choice in an era of tight margins and rising environmental concerns.

Russia’s Ilyushin Il-96: A Quadjet Revival Against the Odds

While most of the world has moved on from quadjets, Russia has turned back to the Ilyushin Il-96 as a stopgap solution. First flown in the late 1980s, the widebody was never a major commercial success, but geopolitical pressures have revived its relevance. With sanctions limiting access to Western aircraft and parts, Moscow is promoting the Il-96 as a domestically built alternative that avoids reliance on Boeing or Airbus.

Technically, however, the Il-96 lags far behind modern competitors. Its four Aviadvigatel engines are less efficient, heavier, and more maintenance-intensive than the high-bypass turbofans that power today’s twinjets. This results in higher operating costs and shorter service life, making the aircraft unattractive outside Russia’s constrained market. Airlines elsewhere have little incentive to revisit such a design when more efficient options are available.

The following data, provided by SKYbrary, shows figures relating to the Il-96.

In practice, the potential Il-96’s revival is less a sign of a broader quadjet comeback and more a reflection of necessity under sanctions. Production numbers are likely to remain small, serving mainly government, state-owned carriers, or special missions. For Russia, the Il-96 provides a way to maintain long-haul capacity without foreign dependence, but for the wider industry, it underscores why four-engine aircraft disappeared from mainstream service in the first place.

Supersonic Dreams: Why Boom’s Overture Needs Four Engines

While quadjets have faded from mainstream passenger service, one ambitious project is bringing four engines back into the conversation: the Boom Overture supersonic jet. Designed to carry 65 to 80 passengers at Mach 1.7, the Overture has shifted from an earlier two or three-engine layout to a four-engine configuration. This decision was not about nostalgia but practicality, reflecting the unique challenges of designing a commercial aircraft that can cruise faster than the speed of sound.

By splitting thrust across four smaller engines, Boom avoids the complexity and certification hurdles of building entirely new large supersonic powerplants. The arrangement also helps distribute weight and reduce engine size, which eases development and improves aerodynamics. Another benefit is noise management: using four smaller engines instead of two massive ones lowers the acoustic footprint, a critical factor in meeting both airport and environmental regulations.

The Overture’s use of four engines highlights how design requirements can still justify a return to multi-engine layouts under special circumstances. Unlike subsonic long-haul airliners, where efficiency dominates, supersonic travel faces different constraints: sonic boom mitigation, heat, and noise. For Boom, four engines offer a compromise that balances performance, manufacturing ease, and sustainability, keeping alive a narrow but fascinating role for quadjets in the future of commercial aviation.

Could Quad-Jets Return If Sustainable Aviation Fuel Is Cheaper?

If sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) ever becomes cheaper than conventional jet fuel, it could soften one of the main disadvantages of large quadjets like the Airbus A380 or Boeing 747-8: high fuel burn. Today, SAF costs three to five times more than conventional jet fuel, making fuel-hungry designs even harder to justify. A price drop could reduce this penalty and reopen discussions about very large aircraft on dense, long-haul routes.

But cheaper fuel alone does not solve every problem. Quadjets remain more complex and expensive to maintain, while many airports struggle to accommodate them. Airlines also prefer the flexibility of smaller twinjets, which allow more frequent departures and better match demand. These structural factors have driven the decline of quadjets even more than fuel prices.

The following data from the US Department of Energy and a Boston Consulting Group report displays a comparison between fuel sources.

That said, if SAF becomes abundant and affordable, niche opportunities could emerge. High-volume hub-to-hub routes, prestige operations, or cases where capacity outweighs efficiency might tempt airlines to reconsider double-deck quadjets. A true resurgence is unlikely, but a limited role in a greener aviation future cannot be ruled out.

The Future of Quadjets: Niche Roles or True Comeback?

The prospects for a full-scale return of quad-engine passenger aircraft remain slim. For most airlines, efficiency and flexibility outweigh the redundancy and size advantages of four engines. Modern twinjets already offer long range, high reliability, and ample capacity for nearly all commercial routes. With fuel costs rising and environmental regulations tightening, airlines have little incentive to revisit designs that are heavier, louder, and less efficient.

That said, niche roles could preserve a limited future for quadjets. Russia’s potential revival of the Il-96 shows how geopolitical constraints can drive production even when the economics are unfavorable. Meanwhile, supersonic projects like Boom’s Overture demonstrate that specific design challenges, such as noise and thrust distribution, can make four engines the most practical solution. In the cargo sector, converted 747s continue to provide unmatched volume and payload capacity, extending the legacy of quadjets long after their passenger variants have disappeared.

Ultimately, four-engine aircraft are unlikely to regain their former dominance, but they may persist in specialized corners of aviation. Whether for political necessity, technological innovation, or heavy-lift cargo, quadjets could still serve as outliers in a twinjet-dominated world. Their future lies not in mass adoption but in filling unique roles where two engines alone cannot deliver.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_1422464285-3.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-22 02:56:39.731094

The upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMI) is set to redefine air travel with a terminal building inspired by the national flower, the lotus - an iconic design blending futuristic aesthetics with efficiency. The airport will be inaugurated soon. In a multi-part series, mid-day takes a wholistic view of the latest addition to citizens's flying experience and checks out accessibility, convenience, options for hotels, restaurants and local conveyance.

Today, we bring you the features and a birds-eye view of the facility. Developed in multiple phases, the airport will eventually feature four passenger terminals capable of handling 90 million passengers annually. All terminals will be interconnected by Automated People Movers (APMs) - self-propelled electric shuttles similar to those at major global airports - allowing passengers to check in at any terminal and reach their gates seamlessly.

Billed as India's greenest airport, NMI will rely entirely on electric vehicles for airside operations, generate 47 MW of solar power, and store Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). It will also feature rainwater harvesting, extensive water recycling, landscaped water bodies, and skylit terminals designed to maximise natural light.

The cargo infrastructure is planned to scale up from 0.5 million metric tonnes (MMT) in Phase 1 to 2.6 MMT by Phase 5. Meanwhile, India's largest General Aviation terminal will host high-end dining, including a Michelin-star restaurant. Navi Mumbai International Airport Pvt. Ltd. (NMIAL) has also tied up with Mahanagar Gas Ltd. (MGL) to supply around 2300 kg of piped natural gas daily across multiple facilities.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has allotted the code âNMI' to the airport, which is already attracting interest from global logistics and e-commerce giants operating some of the world's largest aircraft.

Industry leaders warn, however, that the high upfront costs and uncertain global demand mean state support will be critical.

SK Energy has taken the lead, investing 15 billion won ($11 million) in its Ulsan complex to establish an annual 100,000-ton SAF production line using a co-processing method that blends bio-feedstocks such as used cooking oil with crude oil.

The output, the company said, could cut carbon emissions by 300,000 tons a year. Since last year, SK has exported SAF to Europe and supplied domestic carriers including Korean Air and Jeju Air, while also securing contracts with Cathay Pacific.

GS Caltex has partnered with Finland’s Neste, the world’s largest biofuel producer, to supply and export SAF, including a 5,000-kiloliter shipment to Japan’s Narita Airport certified under the International Civil Aviation Organization’s CORSIA regime. The company is also preparing to expand supply following the government’s roadmap.

HD Hyundai Oilbank and S-Oil have similarly secured international certifications and begun exports to Japan and Europe, with both exploring dedicated production facilities to meet growing demand.

Refiners argue that government incentives will be decisive. Building a dedicated SAF plant costs about 1 trillion won ($720 million), they note, while feedstock procurement remains challenging. In contrast, the EU offers emissions credits to airlines using SAF, the United States provides $1.25–$1.75 per gallon in tax credits to producers, and Japan grants corporate tax breaks of up to 40 percent for SAF-related investment.

Despite mounting losses in their refining businesses—industrywide deficits reached 1.5 trillion won in the first half of 2025—South Korea’s refiners say they have little choice but to accelerate SAF development to protect the country’s status as the world’s top jet fuel exporter and meet tightening global climate regulations.

“The risks are high, but this is an unavoidable transition,” the Korea Petroleum Association said, urging lawmakers to include SAF in pending tax legislation designed to stimulate domestic production.

In 2024, Sri Lanka welcomed 8.88 million passengers, marking a 17.6% year-on-year increase. In the first half of 2025 alone, arrivals reached 4.9 million, up 16% compared to the same period in 2024. Alongside this, aircraft movements surged by 20% in 2024, while the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) has embarked on a major expansion and modernisation program. These developments underscore the urgency of investing in seamless, efficient, and secure passenger journeys powered by digital solutions.

The aviation industry globally recorded historic highs in 2024, with absolute IT spend soaring to an estimated $ 37 billion, the highest since 2019. Much of this investment is being channelled into cloud migration, AI, and cybersecurity to strengthen operations and enhance passenger experience. Airlines worldwide have adopted data platforms at a rate of 90%, reflecting the industry’s commitment to building more intelligent, integrated systems.

SITA’s recent industry survey shows that 50% of investments now target advanced data-driven technologies, including generative AI, computer vision, and large language models. These solutions are already streamlining operations, from cyber-defence to customer service, and paving the way for more sustainable aviation through innovations such as cruise optimisation and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) adoption.

With global passenger traffic hitting a record 5.3 billion in 2024, baggage systems faced unprecedented pressure. Yet, mishandling rates improved by 8.7%, falling to 6.3 bags per 1,000 passengers, a 67% drop since 2007. Still, mishandled baggage costs airlines $ 5 billion annually.

SITA’s Baggage IT Insights Report highlights how automation and real-time data are reshaping this landscape. Self-service bag drops, electronic tags, IoT, and GPS-enabled tracking are becoming standard. Currently, 42% of passengers benefit from real-time baggage tracking, a figure projected to rise to 82% by 2027. For Sri Lanka, where growth in inbound tourism will strain existing systems, these innovations are critical to maintaining efficiency and traveller confidence.

Sri Lanka’s tourism-driven economy requires secure yet welcoming borders. Governments worldwide are adopting digital border management solutions to manage risks from immigration, customs, security, and public health. SITA’s Advance Passenger Processing (APP) solution enables real-time interactive data exchange with airlines, allowing authorities to screen travellers before boarding. This ensures that high-risk individuals are prevented from travelling, while legitimate passengers enjoy a smoother, faster arrival experience. Already deployed in over 70 countries, including major transit hubs like Doha and Dubai, APP could play a pivotal role in securing and streamlining Sri Lanka’s borders.

The adoption of ICAO’s Digital Travel Credential (DTC) standard is another game-changer. By enabling biometric verification and digital passports, governments can eliminate data errors, enhance security, and improve passenger flows. For a destination targeting rapid tourism growth, digital identity and border innovation will be key enablers. As BIA undergoes modernisation, SITA is uniquely positioned to support Sri Lanka’s aviation stakeholders with:

Passenger flow management — streamlining check-in, boarding, and baggage handling with touchless and self-service solutions

Data and AI integration — leveraging predictive analytics to optimise airline operations, improve in-flight services, and strengthen cybersecurity

Baggage management — delivering real-time tracking and automation to reduce mishandling and associated costs

Border security and facilitation — deploying APP and digital credentials to balance security with traveller convenience

The government said the new 10-year Cleaner Fuels Program would stimulate private investment in Australian onshore production of low-carbon liquid fuels such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.
The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) has estimated an Australian low-carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050.
“$1.1 billion for low-carbon liquid fuels production here in Australia builds on the $250 million we have already allocated to low-carbon liquid fuels research and development through the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.” The Low Carbon Fuels Alliance of Australia and New Zealand (LCFAANZ), which represents more than 300 stakeholders, welcomed the announcement.
LCFAANZ founder and CEO of Bioenergy Australia Shahana McKenzie said the announcement represented a major breakthrough in building Australia’s low-carbon liquid fuels industry.","Just a day before it revealed its carbon-reduction goals for 2035, the Federal Government announced a $1.1 billion investment in the development of low-carbon fuels as part of its policies to shift to cleaner energies and drive decarbonisation across key industries.

Low-carbon fuels are an alternative to traditional oil and gas-derived fossil fuels, and are developed from feedstocks such as canola, sorghum and sugar, and from waste products.

While they still produce emissions, these are considerably lower and burn cleaner than fossil fuels, and require fewer carbon emissions to produce.

The government said the new 10-year Cleaner Fuels Program would stimulate private investment in Australian onshore production of low-carbon liquid fuels such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. This would ensure Australia had supply chains for sustainable fuels to power trucks, construction and farming machinery, cargo ships and planes.

Liquid fuels made up about half of Australia’s national energy use, and replacing those fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives would deliver massive climate and economic opportunities, the government said.

The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) has estimated an Australian low-carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050. It said the funding to make cleaner fuel in Australia would help back Australian innovators to make the fuel supply greener and more resilient, and to make low-carbon fuels available for early adopters.

The CEFC said a mature Australian low-carbon liquid fuel industry could deliver about 230 million tonnes of CO2-e in cumulative emissions reduction by 2050, equivalent to more than twice Australia’s current annual transport emissions.

Funding eligibility will be considered through public consultation and design work to take place over the next financial year, with grants to be awarded through a competitive process.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers said low-carbon liquid fuels were an enormous economic opportunity for Australia.

“It’s about making Australians and our economy big beneficiaries of the global net-zero transformation,” he said.

“Developing this industry has potential to make us an indispensable part of growing global net-zero supply chains.

“This is a down payment on developing an entirely new industry in Australia.

“From the farm to the refinery, from primary production to processing, this will create more jobs and more opportunities for Australian workers and businesses.”

Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen said making cleaner fuels in Australia from Australian feedstocks created a path for emissions reduction in sectors that were the hardest to clean up.

“Across the nation, we have two billion litres worth of projects in the pipeline, many of which are ready to scale up production,” Mr Bowen said.

“A new thriving domestic industry with more jobs in our regions, from farmers growing the inputs to workers refining the fuels of the future, is within our reach.

“$1.1 billion for low-carbon liquid fuels production here in Australia builds on the $250 million we have already allocated to low-carbon liquid fuels research and development through the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.”

The Low Carbon Fuels Alliance of Australia and New Zealand (LCFAANZ), which represents more than 300 stakeholders, welcomed the announcement. The organisation said the investment represented a clear signal to the world that Australia was open for business in the development and deployment of low-carbon liquid fuels.

LCFAANZ founder and CEO of Bioenergy Australia Shahana McKenzie said the announcement represented a major breakthrough in building Australia’s low-carbon liquid fuels industry.

“This investment changes the game for Australia’s homegrown low-carbon fuel industry and our energy security,” she said.

“It sets the foundation for a cleaner, more resilient economy – supporting jobs, sparking innovation and providing hard-to-abate sectors with the affordable, sustainable fuels they need to reach net zero.”

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) company Jet Zero also welcomed the announcement, calling it “a step-change” for SAF in Australia.

“As a company focused on bringing the regions to the runway with SAF, we are extremely excited about this new funding support and what it means for our most advanced project, Project Ulysses,” said CEO Ed Mason, referring to Jet Zero’s alcohol-to-jet fuel SAF project in Townsville.

“I want to acknowledge the efforts of the Jet Zero team and our partners, who have been advocating policy support for the sector over the last three years.

“We have seen voices supporting SAF broaden to include Defence and agricultural bodies such as the National Farmers’ Federation, Canegrowers and Grains Australia.”

Aviation/Aerospace Australia, the national association for the Australian aviation, aerospace and space industries, also welcomed the government’s investment.

“Our mission has been to advocate for a sustainable industry, and our GreenSkies initiative is to promote action on sustainability through our working groups in awareness, skills and training; emerging technologies; and infrastructure and supply chain,” it said.",https://psnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/05/2024-05-15-Budget-Address-Jim-Chalmers-2-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 21:56:58.262708

대한항공의 국산 SAF 확대 사용 항공편은 인천을 출발해 일본 고베로 가는 KE731편과 김포를 출발해 일본 오사카로 향하는 KE2117편이다. 올해 9월 19일부터 내년 12월 31일까지 약 1년 4개월 동안 해당 항공편(KE731편 총 90회·KE2117편 총 26회 예정) 전체 항공유의 1%를 국산 SAF로 채운다.

인천-고베 노선에는 HD현대오일뱅크, 김포-오사카 노선에는 GS칼텍스가 생산한 국산 SAF를 공급한다. 양사가 생산한 SAF 모두 폐식용유(UCO·Used Cooking Oil)를 활용했고 국제민간항공기구(ICAO)의 국제항공 탄소 상쇄 및 감축 제도(CORSIA) 인증을 받았다.

Looking ahead The Aviation Action Plan 2025 represents a necessary and overdue strategic reset for New Zealand's aviation sector.","The Interim Aviation Council's Aviation Action Plan marks a significant strategic pivot for the New Zealand aviation sector, which is vital to the country’s economic prosperity and global connectivity. It follows the Ministry of Transport’s Air Navigation System Review from May 2023, which highlighted the need for change and collective action to make it possible. The plan provides the much needed policy intent to reorient the sector and position it better to address systemic challenges and disruptive global forces, safely.

The plan's strategic framework is built upon a series of shorter-term, initial actions with assigned leadership across government agencies, industry, and the Aviation Council (interim, for the time being) itself. Government-led actions are intended to unlock regulatory barriers and address information gaps, with success contingent on collaboration between public and private sector entities. The plan outlines four core priorities: a world-class regulatory environment, an industry to attract, train, and maintain a skilled workforce, a resilient and productive aviation system, and well-planned infrastructure.

The plan provides much needed direction and, for the first time, a coordinated programme to address the sector’s critical deficiencies. Its strength lies in its clear executive intent, but its success will depend on turning high level ambitions into substantive and properly resourced action.

Aviation rests on a simple discipline: aviate, navigate, communicate. It is about control, direction, and communication, in that order. These qualities are essential in the cockpit, and they should also underpin strategic planning for the sector. The action plan leans heavily on frameworks for future work. What is now needed alongside that is control, through measures that can be executed, clarity about the path forward across all four priorities, and communication that gives the industry confidence in how and when outcomes will be delivered.

A world-class regulatory environment

Regulatory reform is arguably the plan’s most critical pillar, directly addressing widespread industry criticism that red tape and thus “a slow system”, is the primary constraint holding aviation back and making New Zealand a less attractive host for aerospace innovation. This must end. The vision for a world-class, nimble, risk-based, enabling framework is a welcome response to long-standing calls for change.

The government intends to deliver this by reworking civil aviation rules under the Civil Aviation Act 2023 and launching a two-year rolling rule-making programme to implement recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), within the next three months, an ambitious (and perhaps unrealistic?) timeline. Speed and quality are essential – let’s hope the latter is not sacrificed for the former.

Regardless of how well designed the framework may be, its success depends on an agile and well resourced Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). That capacity is now under review and must be considered in the context of recent budget reductions across government agencies. Without that commitment, the ambition for a more responsive and enabling system will be difficult to realise.

Regulation alone will not determine the sector’s future. The effectiveness of any framework ultimately depends on the people who bring it to life.

The Human Factor

A world-class aviation system, no matter how technologically advanced, is only as strong as the people who operate it. The Action Plan rightly identifies human capability as the most significant long-term risk to the sector, highlighting a critical vulnerability in its workforce pipeline. The statistics are stark: with a five-year attrition rate of 78% for new entrants, the system is failing to retain the talent it develops. The plan’s proposed actions, such as updating pilot qualifications and developing a future “workforce package of options”, are necessary steps towards addressing this leakage.

However, a successful workforce strategy must stand on three pillars: train, attract, and retain. The plan’s focus is almost exclusively on training and retaining. It is silent on a crucial third pillar: a proactive strategy to attract top-tier overseas talent. The single action to progress mutual recognition agreements for licences is a passive administrative step, not a competitive strategy to draw the world’s best to New Zealand. In a global market where New Zealand is losing talent to better opportunities abroad, our mountains and ranges are not a sufficient drawcard; talent follows opportunity, which requires competitive pay and an innovative environment in which to grow.

A critical component of strengthening the domestic talent pipeline is broadening the pool from which it can draw. The plan’s ambition to increase the participation of Māori and women is a crucial goal. However, achieving this requires a strategy that goes beyond simple recruitment targets. It necessitates a focus on creating equitable access to training and career pathways. This may require targeted financial and social support to overcome existing barriers, ensuring that talented individuals from all backgrounds are equipped to develop and demonstrate their capabilities. The ultimate objective is to create a true meritocracy, where the sector benefits from the widest possible pool of excellence because every potential candidate has had a fair opportunity to earn their place.

Systemic resilience and connectivity

The Action Plan approaches the sector’s economic health with a dual strategy: immediate intervention to stabilise acute symptoms such as rising costs, post-COVID supply chain pressures, and persistent fragility in regional connectivity, and a longer-term diagnosis of the system’s underlying vulnerabilities.

The immediate interventions are pragmatic. The Regional Infrastructure Fund will support vulnerable regional airlines until 2026, providing a lifeline for essential operational costs and enabling the IT systems needed for efficient network integration. Alongside this, the plan initiates a sector-wide diagnostic phase, with actions to document costs and develop a framework to monitor the system’s health. These are necessary steps toward evidence-based policy.

However, the core of any sustainable solution, the system-wide funding review by the CAA and a review of Airways’ pricing framework, will not be completed until late 2027. The long-term resilience of regional connectivity will ultimately depend on the delivery of a decisive and coordinated funding strategy from the 2027 reviews, without a damaging lapse in support.

Building for climate resilience

Reducing fossil fuel use and transitioning to clean energy are non-priority policy ambitions included in the Action Plan, consistent with the national target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Strategic policy support for international efforts to adopt sustainable aviation fuels, introduce more efficient aircraft, and invest in new propulsion and digital technologies provide pathways for emissions reduction and economic growth.

The Action Plan affirms New Zealand’s alignment with international goals, including ICAO’s net zero target for 2050 and the interim goal of reducing international aviation emissions by five percent by 2030. Participation in ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) will continue, alongside engagement in international forums responsible for negotiating aviation emission targets and regional dialogues on sustainable aviation fuel supply.

Initial steps set out in the plan focus on collaboration and sector engagement. These include the commencement of a Climate and Finance dialogue to advance regional cooperation on sustainable aviation fuel, industry participation in the development of a regional SAF strategy, and reaffirmation of New Zealand’s voluntary participation in CORSIA at the 2025 ICAO General Assembly.

In this domain, the Action Plan prioritises alignment and engagement over early regulatory or investment commitments. The strategy sets the direction for future action but reserves substantive domestic policy and investment decisions for further development.

Other policy ambitions

Beyond the core priorities, the Action Plan is built on several other ambitions intended to support the overall health and integrity of the aviation sector:

Maintaining high standards of safety and security, embedding a best-practice culture throughout the sector;

Ensuring New Zealand's participation in the international aviation system is strategic and pursues growth that is in the national interest;

Improving the passenger experience, with a focus on ensuring disabled people have accessible and efficient air travel services and that all consumers are treated fairly when flights are disrupted; and

Creating long-term opportunities for communities, iwi, and businesses to participate and invest in the aviation sector.

Looking ahead

The Aviation Action Plan 2025 represents a necessary and overdue strategic reset for New Zealand's aviation sector. Its primary value lies in providing clear executive intent and a coordinated framework for addressing long-standing, systemic issues that were clearly articulated in the 2023 Air Navigation System Review. For the first time, the industry has a clear direction of travel.

However, the plan is largely a framework of intent. Across regulation, workforce, and infrastructure, it relies heavily on future reviews, the development of options, and funding decisions that are yet to be made. The establishment of a permanent Aviation Council is the critical next step, as the effectiveness of this new body in driving execution will be the ultimate measure of the plan's success. The direction is now set; the challenge will be in the delivery. The sector will be watching closely to see if the commitment to action matches the policy ambitions.",https://www.dentons.co.nz/-/media/images/website/background-images/gpof/abstract/adobestock_272437262.ashx,N,,2025-09-21 20:57:02.701246

HD현대오일뱅크는 22일 대한항공과 인천-고베 노선 SAF 공급 계약을 체결했다고 밝혔다. 계약 기간은 올해 9월부터 2026년 말까지로, HD현대오일뱅크는 해당 노선 항공기 약 90편분 연료를 단독 공급한다.

이번 계약은 2027년 국내 SAF 혼합의무화 제도 시행에 앞서 상업 공급을 시작했다는 점에서 의미가 있다는 평가다. HD현대오일뱅크는 지난해 6월 국내 최초로 SAF를 일본에 수출하며 글로벌 시장에서 기술력을 인정받은 바 있다. 이번에는 대한항공과 손잡고 내수 시장에도 발을 들이며 SAF 사업 입지를 강화했다.

HD현대오일뱅크는 국제 친환경 인증을 기반으로 기존 정유 설비에 바이오 원료를 함께 투입하는 '코프로세싱' 방식으로 SAF를 생산한다. 회사는 정유 설비를 활용하는 만큼 생산 효율성을 높이고 상업 공급 확대에도 유리하다고 분석한다.

SAF 혼합의무화는 세계 각국에서 본격 시행되고 있다. 유럽은 올해 2% 혼합을 시작으로 2050년까지 70%까지 의무 비율을 확대할 계획이며, 일본도 2030년까지 항공유 판매량의 10%를 SAF로 대체한다는 목표를 세웠다. 우리나라 역시 산업통상자원부가 지난 19일 2027년부터 SAF 혼합의무화 제도를 시행한다고 발표했다.

HD현대오일뱅크 관계자는 ""이번 국내 진출을 통해 SAF를 비롯한 바이오연료 제품의 시장 신뢰도가 크게 높아질 것으로 기대한다""며 ""앞선 기술력을 기반으로 국내외 정책과 수요 변화에 맞춰 SAF 수출 확대에도 나설 것""이라고 말했다.

In recent years, ultra-long-haul flights have become a cornerstone of the modern travel industry, reshaping the way passengers connect across the globe. Thanks to advancements in aircraft technology, airlines can now offer non-stop flights that link far-flung cities, cutting down travel time and eliminating layovers. This article explores how these groundbreaking flights are reshaping the tourism industry, offering convenience and new opportunities for global travelers.

Advancements in Aircraft Technology

The ability to fly ultra-long-haul routes is made possible by modern aircraft like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner. These planes are designed to be more fuel-efficient and lightweight, which allows airlines to operate longer flights without significantly increasing operational costs. With advanced aerodynamics and new, fuel-efficient engines, these aircraft make it economically viable to offer non-stop services between cities that were previously too far apart.

Record-Breaking Flights and New Routes

At present, Singapore Airlines holds the record for the longest non-stop flight, connecting Singapore with New York. This route, which spans approximately 15,000 kilometers, has become a model for the future of air travel. However, the future promises even longer flights. Qantas, for example, is working on “Project Sunrise,” which aims to connect Sydney with both London and New York. These flights will cover more than 17,000 kilometers and last around 20 hours. The aircraft used for these routes, the Airbus A350-1000, will be specially equipped to handle such extended flights, with enhanced cabin comfort and specially designed fuel systems.

In addition to Qantas, Turkish Airlines is planning a new ultra-long-haul route from Istanbul to Sydney, set to debut in 2026. This will further demonstrate the demand for such flights, as well as the airlines’ ability to manage long-duration operations effectively. These routes signify a broader trend in the airline industry: the growing demand for direct connections between distant cities, driven by both technological advancements and passenger demand.

Why Ultra-Long-Haul Flights Matter to Travelers

For travelers, the appeal of ultra-long-haul flights is clear. Non-stop flights eliminate the need for layovers, saving valuable time and making long-distance travel much more convenient. Business travelers, who often need to minimize travel time, are particularly drawn to these ultra-long flights, as they can now reach far-off destinations in a single journey. Similarly, leisure travelers seeking to explore global destinations without the hassle of layovers are also increasingly interested in these services.

The passenger experience on ultra-long-haul flights has also improved significantly. Airlines have designed the cabins of ultra-long-haul aircraft with passenger comfort in mind. Enhanced air circulation, quieter engines, and better cabin pressurization all contribute to a more comfortable flying experience. Additionally, passengers on these flights can expect improved meal options and in-flight entertainment, making the long journey more enjoyable.

The Economics of Ultra-Long-Haul Flights

From an economic perspective, ultra-long-haul flights have become increasingly profitable for airlines. While the longer flights require more fuel and maintenance, the efficiency of modern aircraft allows airlines to balance these costs. By offering non-stop services between major cities, airlines can attract more passengers who are willing to pay a premium for the convenience of not having to deal with layovers.

Qantas’ “Project Sunrise” is particularly noteworthy in this regard, as it will provide a unique opportunity for airlines to test the viability of extremely long routes on a commercial scale. With anticipated ticket prices higher than traditional routes, the demand from passengers is expected to remain strong, proving that the appetite for ultra-long-haul travel is growing.

Looking Ahead: The Future of Air Travel

As technology continues to evolve, the possibility of even longer, non-stop routes will only increase. In addition to advancements in aircraft design, other innovations such as sustainable aviation fuel may further contribute to making ultra-long-haul flights more environmentally friendly. Airlines are also exploring ways to optimize flight paths and reduce fuel consumption, ensuring that these flights remain both economically and environmentally viable.

Passengers can look forward to a future where more destinations are connected by ultra-long-haul flights, bringing the world closer together. As demand grows, airlines are expected to continue expanding these services, offering even more opportunities for global travel.

Connecting the World Like Never Before

The rise of ultra-long-haul flights represents a significant step forward in the world of travel. With airlines continuously pushing the boundaries of what is possible, these non-stop routes are changing the way people experience the world. From the introduction of ultra-long-haul aircraft to the demand for seamless, layover-free travel, the future of air travel is set to become even more convenient, accessible, and efficient for passengers.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250921_2320_Airplane-Over-Cityscape_simple_compose_01k5pp9vt4eg0asxdpcam7wdnf-1-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 19:56:14.603259

In a historic moment that changed the face of the world, the Charter of the UN emerged eighty years ago as a shining star in a sky darkened by the smoke of wars, opening doors of hope to a world of tranquillity, stability, and safety for the peoples of the Earth, who pledged to unite under the banner of peace and weave dreams of unity into a reality flourishing with justice and co-operation.The Charter served as a bridge across the abyss of conflict, uniting nations in their pursuit of stability and development. From the halls of deliberation to the fields of humanitarian action, written words transformed into deeds that saved lives and rebuilt communities of peoples and tribes, paving countless paths towards a future filled with unwavering optimism, to build a world that embraces all and upholds human dignity in every corner of the globe.On Oct 25, 1945, in the aftermath of World War II, representatives of around 50 countries gathered in San Francisco, USA, to sign the Charter of the UN, a document that carried within it a new hope for a world torn apart by the ravages of war, and a solemn vow that such devastating conflict would never occur again.In celebration of the 80th anniversary of the signing of the Charter, the UN General Assembly held a commemorative event at the organisation’s headquarters in New York City on June 26, reviving the spirit of San Francisco and embracing the ideals that united humanity in its darkest hours.During the ceremony, attendees heard remarks from the President of the UN General Assembly, the Secretary-General, the President of the Security Council, the President of the Economic and Social Council, and the President of the International Court of Justice.They emphasised the importance of recommitting to the principles of the Charter amid escalating conflicts and violations of international law, affirming that multilateralism remains the only path to safeguarding peace, dignity, and human rights.President of the General Assembly Philemon Yang stated that the signing of the Charter marked a turning point in modern history following the devastation of two World Wars, laying the foundations for a new multilateral system meant to be built on dialogue and co-operation.He added that the UN, over eight decades, has been at the heart of humanity’s response to its greatest challenges, shaping a global agenda that aspires to peace, development, and dignity, not as dreams for some, but as promises for all.For his part, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that eighty years after the signing of the Charter, the world is witnessing unprecedented assaults on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, urging all member states to uphold the spirit and letter of the Charter and the future it calls all to build, for peace, justice, and progress, for all peoples of the earth.Guterres also affirmed that the Charter has provided the tools to change destinies, save lives, and instil hope in the most despairing corners of the world.The UN Charter consists of 19 chapters comprising 111 articles. It begins with an inspiring preamble focused on maintaining international peace and security, fostering friendly relations among nations, and promoting international co-operation to solve economic, social, and cultural problems.Through its chapters, the Charter outlines a roadmap for peace, justice, and co-operation, affirming principles of sovereign equality, respect for international obligations, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. It also defines the conditions for admitting new members, suspending membership, or expelling any state that violates its principles.The chapters of the Charter specify the roles and responsibilities of the UN General Assembly, the Security Council, and the Secretary-General.Chapter VII, one of the most critical sections, addresses actions related to threats to peace. When peaceful means fail, this chapter grants the Security Council the authority to take decisive measures, such as economic sanctions or military intervention. It also recognises the right of states to self-defence if subjected to armed attack.On various occasions, Qatar renews its unwavering commitment to the spirit and letter of the UN Charter, affirming its dedication to supporting the UN’s continued role as a platform for dialogue and unity in today’s world.Most recently, this position was expressed in early July by Qatar’s Permanent Representative to the UN HE Sheikha Alya Ahmed bin Saif al-Thani, in a statement delivered before the UN General Assembly meeting held in New York to mark the 80th anniversary of the signing of the UN Charter.HE Sheikha Alya emphasised that the 80th anniversary represents a pivotal moment to unify efforts in preserving international peace and security and promoting economic and social progress for all peoples, stressing that the role of the UN has become more vital and urgent, especially as the world today faces the highest number of conflicts since 1945.She noted that Qatar has consistently championed the centrality of international law, the principles of the Charter, the peaceful resolution of disputes, and the respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states.Over the decades, the UN has played a central role in resolving conflicts and preventing their escalation. Since 1948, it has launched more than 70 peacekeeping operations, including missions in Lebanon, Sinai, Cyprus, and the Congo.Hundreds of thousands of Blue Helmets have participated in these operations, helping stabilise conflict zones and saving millions of lives.The organisation has also contributed to the signing of historic peace agreements, such as the Camp David Accords (1978) between Egypt and Israel, and the peace agreements in Colombia (2016). It supported reconciliation efforts in regions like Rwanda and Bosnia following devastating conflicts. Through the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1970, the UN played a decisive role in curbing the nuclear arms race, helping avert a global catastrophe.In the realm of human rights, the UN has been a voice for the vulnerable and a refuge for those in need. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights stands as one of its landmark achievements, a historic document that set global standards for human rights, inspired constitutions and legal systems worldwide, and laid the foundation for holding states accountable for violations.Throughout its eight-decade journey, the UN has provided humanitarian aid to millions affected by wars and natural disasters across the globe. In addressing the climate crisis, the UN demonstrated visionary leadership, playing a key role in shaping the Paris Climate Agreement (2015), a historic accord in which member states committed to reducing carbon emissions and limiting global warming to below two degrees Celsius.During the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organisation (WHO), a UN agency, led global efforts to distribute vaccines through the Covax initiative, which delivered billions of doses to low-income countries.Despite its many successes, the UN has not been immune to criticism. It has faced scrutiny over its limited influence in major conflicts and the slow pace of decision-making due to disagreements among member states. Nevertheless, the organisation continues to adapt, focusing on future challenges such as cybersecurity, climate-induced migration, and the risks and ethics of artificial intelligence.Between triumphs and setbacks, the UN has remained, for eighty years, a beating heart of hope and global co-operation. It has rescued millions from the grip of crises, disasters, wars, poverty, and disease, raising the banner of rights and freedoms atop vessels of hope.The UN has preserved its role as a compass guiding humanity’s ship, steering its rudder and sails through the winds of turmoil and storms of hardship, so that the dream of peace and co-operation among nations may become a tangible reality, embraced and breathed by every human on this planet.",https://www.gulf-times.com/gulftimes/uploads/images/2025/09/21/359988.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 19:56:24.074766

The news follows a difficult spring for EWR when outdated equipment, shortages of ATCs, and technology failures led to flight delays and cancellations. In response, United, federal authorities, and state officials have worked together to restore service performance and enhance capacity.

United Newark Airport Upgrade

Earlier this year, Newark suffered serious disruptions due to technology outages, air traffic control staffing gaps, and runway construction.

Since then, improvements such as completion of runway work ahead of schedule, installation of a new fiber-optic network, and limits on hourly flight operations have helped United restore service levels.

According to islands.com, United will add over 2,500 employees at EWR between now and late 2026 to meet rising operational demands. The carrier already employs more than 14,000 people in the Newark/New York City region, including over 3,000 pilots and 5,700 flight attendants.

Over the summer, United recorded its best on-time performance ever at EWR. More than 6 million passengers flew on United-operated flights on schedule — exceeding comparable metrics at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA).

United’s Route Expansions

Moving forward, United plans to serve over 160 domestic and international destinations from Newark.

New international routes include Rome, Venice, Porto, Marrakesh, and Dublin. Domestically, the new service will go to cities such as Palm Springs, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Columbia (South Carolina), and Chattanooga (Tennessee).

United will also become the first major airline to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for use at Newark, acquiring up to one million gallons from Neste this year. SAF reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions relative to fossil jet fuel.

State and local leaders have praised the partnership between EWR and United, as it will help the economy of the region. Governor Phil Murphy and other officials noted that Newark functions as a vital international gateway and its smooth operation is essential to commerce and tourism.

Bottom Line

Despite improvements, constraints remain. In May, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reduced the number of flights per hour at Newark from 86 to 68 due to safety and operational concerns. That limit has since been tentatively adjusted to 72 flights per hour through summer 2026.

The updates to air traffic control systems, staff increases, and technology upgrades must continue on schedule to avoid recurrence of disruptions.

Il caso

Amazzonia in crisi: tra deforestazione e una COP30 piena di guai

di Giacomo Talignani 05 Settembre 2025

A livello mondiale, gli Stati Uniti sono il maggior produttore mondiale. Nel 2023, si stima che la produzione americana di SAF abbia toccato quota 190 milioni di litri, ma siamo a meno dell'1% del carburante per aereo totale consumato dal paese. Mentre il mercato globale del carburante per jet, seppur piccolo, vale circa 2,9 miliardi di dollari nel 2025 secondo la società di analisi SkyQuest Technology Group, rispetto al mercato globale di 239 miliardi di dollari per il carburante per aviazione convenzionale.

All’interno di questa filiera produttiva, che nonostante i numeri esigui, riguarda miliardi di dollari di fatturato, s’inserisce una vicenda dai contorni torbidi, che lega un’azienda produttrice del Texas alla Foresta Amazzonica. Stavolta gli alberi non fanno parte di questa storia, ma il bestiame di bovini. Dicevamo, infatti, che una delle fonti per produrre il SAF è il grasso animale. L’agenzia di stampa Reuters, attraverso un’accurata inchiesta ha scoperto che una raffineria texana che vende il carburante verde alle compagnie aeree statunitensi avrebbe acquistato il grasso proveniente dal bestiame allevato su terreni illegalmente disboscati in Amazzonia.

Il nome dell’azienda è Diamond Green Diesel, che ha investito centinaia di milioni di dollari in una raffineria a Port Arthur, nello stato del Texas, che trasforma il sego - questo il nome del grasso bovino - nel carburante “pulito” per gli aerei. L’affare scotta ancor di più perché questa azienda, nel 2022 ha raccolto la considerevole cifra di 3 miliardi di dollari in crediti d'imposta per la produzione di biocarburanti. L’inchiesta ha svelato che dietro al sego ci sono due fabbriche brasiliane che hanno fornito migliaia di tonnellate di grasso, a loro volta comprato da macelli che avrebbero acquistato animali da allevamenti illegalmente disboscati nella foresta pluviale amazzonica. Insomma un circolo vizioso non da poco.

Anche perché i vettori aerei, che a loro volta comprano SAF, ottengono dei crediti per la riduzione delle loro emissioni, perché l'impianto di Diamond Green Diesel è certificato sulla base di un accordo che coinvolge le Nazioni Unite. Come dire che tutti gli attori in gioco ci guadagnano, ma in modo sporco. O comunque poco trasparente, a danno, ancora una volta del povero polmone verde del mondo, in cui l'industria bovina brasiliana è coinvolta in modo importante.

Intanto, in Brasile le autorità giudiziarie hanno acceso i riflettori sulla faccenda. ”Le aziende che traggono profitto da materie prime provenienti da una catena di approvvigionamento che implica la deforestazione, sono anche responsabili di queste illegalità"", ha detto a Reuters, Ricardo Negrini, procuratore federale brasiliano che ha aperto una serie di indagini sull'industria bovina; per contro le aziende coinvolte non avrebbero rilasciato commenti alle domande dettagliate sulla catena di approvvigionamento del sego brasiliano.

Se le compagnie aeree, per raggiungere gli obiettivi di riduzione ed azzeramento di emissioni di CO? entro il 2050, sono sotto pressione dei rispettivi enti competenti per ciascun paese (come avviene per l’industria dell’auto), è altresì vero che il SAF o comunque il carburante sostenibile per l’aviazione per ottenere il certificato d’idoneità ai crediti, non deve provenire da biomassa di terreni deforestati dopo il 2008 o da aree protette secondo gli accordi internazionali.

A spingere le compagnie aeree verso net zero è CORSIA, acronimo di Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, meccanismo basato sul mercato, sviluppato e gestito dall'International Civil Aviation Organization, l'agenzia delle Nazioni Unite che sovrintende alle convenzioni sull'aviazione civile internazionale. Se in questa fase l’adesione delle compagnie è ancora su base volontaria, dal 2027 sarà d’obbligo per poter riscattare i crediti compensativi legati alle emissioni di CO?.",https://www.repstatic.it/content/contenthub/img/2025/09/18/160546869-df4f7006-daa6-4c21-9192-4a6cc6202b3c.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 16:56:56.534277

Otto Aerospace’s Phantom 3500 is set to revolutionise the business jet industry with its unique laminar flow technology.

The aircraft is a clean-sheet design that promotes sustainable aviation through its architecture, composite airframe, and advanced manufacturing techniques.

The ultra-smooth surfaces across its exterior are expected to reduce drag by 35% over existing comparable jets, resulting in up to 61% lower fuel burn.

Designed to accommodate nine passengers in a typical business configuration, the Phantom 3500 combines range, luxury, and sustainability. With the preliminary design validated through comprehensive wind tunnel tests, Otto Aerospace is set to proceed with the development phase.

The company is targeting a maiden flight in early 2027, with the type’s entry into service scheduled for 2030.

The Phanton 3500 and its laminar flow design

Aerodynamic drag is one of the most significant barriers to aircraft efficiency. Design inefficiencies allow high-speed airflow over the aircraft surface to become turbulent, thereby increasing fuel burn.

A complete laminar flow design allows smooth flow of air particles over the surface with minimal or no mixing between them. Unlike traditional aircraft designs that largely focus on implementing laminar flow only over wings (for an optimised lift-over-drag ratio), Otto Aerospace has harnessed laminar flow at an unprecedented scale.

Every shape, contour, and surface is optimised to cut fuel consumption and carbon emissions during flight. Fuel efficiency is one of the most effective ways to curb carbon emissions in aviation.

Otto Aerospace says that the design of the Phantom 3500 will deliver up to 61% lower fuel burn than super midsize jets like Bombardier Challenger 350 and Citation Latitude. Compared to light jets like the Embraer Phenom 300 and Citation CJ4, the Phantom could bring up to a 52% reduction in fuel burn.

The Phantom 3500 maximises laminar flow across the entire airframe, combining sleek design and precision manufacturing. Its aerodynamic structure is optimised for efficiency and range, with a laminar flow fuselage that eliminates windows to deliver significant structural improvement over conventional designs.

High-definition digital displays in the rear cabin enhance passenger experience while seamlessly offering real-time external views. Wings and control surfaces are designed to prevent micro-disturbances to the airflow, allowing efficient transition between laminar and turbulent flows during flight.

In addition to external contour, next-generation manufacturing precision eliminates even the smallest design imperfections. Otto Aerospace has developed advanced manufacturing techniques to minimise surface distortions that result in turbulent flows.

The design and precision aspects of the aircraft promote sustainable air travel – a pressing need of the aviation industry. Combining design and manufacturing benefits with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the Phantom 3500 is capable of reducing carbon emissions by over 90% to comparable aircraft.

Could laminar flow help decarbonise larger aircraft?

The aviation industry is facing growing pressure to decarbonise through innovative designs and alternative fuels. Minimising fuel consumption remains the most effective way to achieve industry-wide sustainability goals. A significant reduction in aerodynamic drag will slash fuel consumption and carbon emissions at source.

Despite laminar flow technology being a well-known concept for commercial airliners, its use is generally limited to wings and control surfaces. Modern wings prevent airflow distortions while using laminar flow control techniques on critical surfaces.

Integrating laminar flow technology into all design aspects of commercial aircraft is complex and expensive. Laminar flow control systems present significant design and structural challenges, particularly across the full range of flight conditions.

Moreover, the use of advanced materials and highly precise manufacturing at scale will take a significant toll on production costs.

With large commercial aircraft manufacturers like Airbus and Boeing heavily involved in cutting-edge research, it is a matter of time before laminar flow technology can be fully implemented on commercial airliners.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Otto-aerospace-phanton-3500.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 14:56:46.389468

A USDA report has once again sent shockwaves through the corn market. Their prediction, a record-setting 188.8 bushels per acre, puts even more pressure on farmers already facing financial hardship and declining incomes. After all the hard work, all the input costs, and all the uncertainty, farmers are now staring down yet another hit to their bottom line.

This kind of volatility isn’t new, and the American Carbon Alliance has been shouting from the rooftops for a few years. But this trend is absolutely unacceptable. Year after year, American farmers do their part. They grow more with less, adopt new practices, and feed and fuel the world. But without strong, reliable demand, they’re left chasing markets that won’t sustain them.

We cannot afford to keep going through this cycle. If we continue doing the same thing over and over again, America will lose family farms, and rural economies will suffer. What we need are new markets and ideas that reward innovation and provide lasting stability. That’s why expanding the use of low-carbon fuels, like ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), is more important than ever.

We all know that higher blends of low-carbon ethanol in our cars are a win for everyone, the consumer, the farmer, and our energy security. As with anything, you don’t put all your eggs in one basket. That’s why sustainable aviation fuel and other utilization of low carbon ethanol produced right here on our nation’s farms present such a critical opportunity.

This market is just getting started, and it needs policy certainty from Washington to ensure the United States owns this space, not China, Brazil, or some other global competitor. We can do both: higher ethanol blends in our cars and sustainable aviation fuels in our planes. The result? The U.S. and the American farmer in control of our energy future.

SAF is already being produced here in the U.S., and it’s one of the most promising ways to grow long-term demand for corn. By pairing ethanol with carbon capture technologies, we can produce a drop-in jet fuel that meets strict sustainability standards and creates real opportunity for rural America. This opens new markets for farmers’ crops, expands production opportunities for ethanol facilities, and lifts rural economies.

And we need to acknowledge what’s changed. The old way of hoping Mother Nature balances supply and demand doesn’t hold sway anymore. Today’s corn hybrids withstand drought, disease, and pests better every year. And the old model of simply exporting more raw commodities is no longer a guarantee. Countries like Brazil and Argentina are catching up in scale, acreage, and output. That’s why a new path forward, one that builds domestic demand, is essential.

Congress has taken steps in the right direction with the 45Z tax credit. But now’s the time to protect that policy, build the infrastructure, and give producers the confidence that these markets are here to stay. No more whiplash. No more wondering what the next report will bring. It’s time to grow the demand side of the equation, and that means investing in low-carbon fuels, expanding SAF, supporting carbon capture and sequestration innovation, and making sure the future of agriculture isn’t left up to chance.
