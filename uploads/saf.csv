Researchers from Northumbrian Water hope to produce sustainable aviation fuel using algae grown in domestic sewage. The 'Green Machine' project will use the algae to extract nitrogen and phosphorous from wastewater, before it is recovered and turned into sustainable fuels.

Northumbrian Water hopes to use its Bran Sands Treatment Works site in Teesside to trial the process. It says the project, which has used a £6.5m investment from the firm, will help reduce environmental impacts of waste treatment and could save up to £1m operational costs per year.

The work is in collaboration with US-based firm BrightWave, which specialises in providing the photobioreactors that are used to cultivate algae, and Ligoflux - a specialist filtration company that provides products for algae harvesting.

Angela MacOscar, head of innovation at Northumbrian Water Group, said: ""The Green Machine is set to revolutionise the way we treat waste, and we are incredibly excited that we have started work on this brand new project. With our ‘Power from Poo’ project, where we create green energy using the sludge that is left over from wastewater treatment, we have already shown that we are leading the industry in pushing the boundaries of innovation – and this is set to be carried forward with this project.

""Not only will this help to develop a value-added product, but it will also help to boost us forward towards our own net zero goals and help us to achieve our net zero ambitions.""

Tim Shaw, president at BrightWave, added: “BrightWave is thrilled to support Northumbrian Water in this innovative and important project. It will be one of Europe's largest indoor algae-based initiatives and a model for future applications. We're excited about how this venture's integration of wastewater treatment, SAF development and a low-cost profile will position it as a viable and relevant worldwide solution.""

The UK Government has set up targets an effort to speed up the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel and decarbonise the industry. Its Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate requires 10% of all jet fuel in flights taking off from the UK to come from sustainable sources by 2030.

Letter of the week

Dear Editor

The fire at one of the substations that provides power to Heathrow served as a reminder of the many hundreds of flights that the airport handles every day. Chancellor Reeves justified the recent Government announcement supporting a series of airport expansions by stating that ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ (SAF) was a ‘game changer’ that will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 70 per cent.

Currently, the UK is committed to a 2 per cent SAF content in aviation kerosene and is providing £63million to boost production. To date, this is predominantly derived from used cooking oil, 80 per cent of which is imported from China and Malaysia. It is planned that the SAF content will increase to 22 per cent by 2040, by which time it is forecast that passenger numbers will have doubled, equating globally to 200,000 flights a day consuming over 18million barrels of aviation fuel. This will necessitate the use of multiple sources of feedstock such as municipal waste, sewage and a vast area of land dedicated to growing bioenergy crops. These are already grown on a massive scale to provide the E10 element in the petrol, thus further reducing the area of land available for growing food. Alternatively, SAF could be produced in the form of green hydrogen, but this would require up to 3.4 times more wind and solar capacity than at present.

Clearly, the Chancellor has not taken the trouble to read the report from the Royal Society, which concludes that this course of action could be up to 69 per cent more carbon intensive than using standard kerosene jet fuel and could result in ‘unacceptable collateral ecological damage’. Airline operators may be keen to be seen as environmentally responsible but, in reality, they and the Chancellor are hiding behind another green smokescreen that fails to stand up to robust scrutiny.

Promises and pledges and pretty much nothing else

Dear Editor

My concern is that those in power are not applying any actual political philosophy. There is the seeking of power for power’s sake, but no intention of significantly changing anything. You cannot fault Lenin, or indeed Hitler, for not wanting to change things. At least they went into politics to do something!

Our politicians are not aiming higher than just getting elected. Where is the vision, a bringing together of the people? Where are the ideas, the imagination, the farsightedness, the inspiration?

This country desperately needs a (peaceful) revolution. The difference between the haves and have-nots is unacceptable. This is not some Marxist, communist rant; the population is not coherent as a nation. I am not advocating any sort of nationalism. I am advocating a fair and just society that is at ease with itself.

Politicians of all parties have completely failed us. At the last election, nearly half the people could not even be bothered to vote. There is absolutely no belief in the current political system. It is all promises and pledges and meaningless drivel. The Houses of Parliament are regarded with derision. The House of Lords existence cannot be justified on any grounds. The level of debate in the Commons is pathetic, and since all the members vote in accordance with party lines, what is the point of discussing anything anyway?

The current political system cannot and will not make the fundamental changes needed. The existing parties have no real concept of how a successful country should be administered. This is not success in a material sense, but success in the wellbeing of every single one of us. To achieve that, there must be a different outlook and political system. The gross unfairness must be eliminated completely, and the Government must represent the wishes of the people, not just exclusively their career interests.

A sour taste in a tourist’s mouth

Dear Editor

Keep up the good work. I am incredibly saddened by what’s been going on in the UK for the past few years regarding freedom of speech. The covid debacle seemed to just exacerbate the downward slide.

We have been to the UK (from the United States) so many times that I have stopped counting, and we used to hike almost every year in Scotland. I wonder if the Government realizes they’ve lost two visitors because of both those issues above. Surely, we aren’t the only ones? We did not take the jabs, and I had been concerned had I needed medical care of some sort while there, I couldn’t get it without submitting. Now, I’m concerned that an opinion I express in public might land me in hot water with the ‘authorities’. It’s both disturbing and disgusting to see this.

The UK and most of Western Europe are committing cultural and political suicide, but you know that. It breaks my heart to see it happening. Thank you for being a strong voice in the wilderness.

Dear Editor

Climate Derangement Syndrome has clearly infected the UK’s cheese-manufacturing industry.

Perhaps, ‘Mad Ed’ Miliwatt has shares in Ivy’s Somerset Cheddar Cheese company.

The attached picture was photographed in our local Sainsbury’s today.

Sadly, I suspect the producer was attempting to be serious and I doubt if it was meant to be a joke.

Acquiescence is a political stance

Dear Editor

The family of Sheku Bayoh, who died after officers restrained him, have settled their £1.85million civil damages claim against Police Scotland. The public inquiry, which is still ongoing, has so far cost more than £23million. How much has the family’s solicitor, Aamer Anwar, been paid? By capitulating to political pressure and agreeing to the civil damages claim, the Chief Constable Jo Farrell has betrayed her officers. The Scottish Police Federation reacted with fury and said, ‘The only person who can be said indisputably to have broken the law was Sheku Bayoh.’ They added that evidence showed Bayoh had taken illegal drugs, was thought to have armed himself with a knife and punched a female officer to the ground. It took six police officers to hold him down. Jo Farrell is merely a political puppet doing what she is told to do and is held in low esteem by those she should be leading. Hopefully, the 2026 Scottish general election will see a change in the Scottish Government and result in a new and independent Chief Constable.

In response to Daniel Jupp’s article on Conor McGregor this week, I was reminded of this famous saying about Edmund Burke, an Irish man and an MP in the English Parliament:

The aircraft maker told staff in February that the rollout of its hydrogen aircraft was “expected to come later than 2035” — the date it had previously targeted.
Previous iterations of Airbus’s “ZEROe” programme envisaged a hydrogen fuel cell-powered plane that could carry up to 100 passengers with a range of 1,850km.
As Airbus grapples with hydrogen, Faury issued a further warning on the long-term viability of quotas for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — seen by many as the industry’s only tool to decarbonise at scale.
Worries over sustainable aviation fuel SAF is made in a number of ways, including from used cooking waste, clothes and tyres.","“Given the distribution of our operational system, and the global market we are serving … we think that there are ways to adapt,” Faury said. “We have manufacturing sites in the US, so we think that we have some cards [to play].

“There will be a need for adaptation — it will hurt at the beginning. So I will not say that I am optimistic, but I think realistically we will be able to manage the situation.”

• Airbus boss: European aerospace braced for Trump tariffs

The comments from Faury came just before Trump is set to hail “Liberation Day” on Wednesday — when a raft of protectionist measures, designed to promote American jobs at the expense of free trade, come into force.

Failing a last-minute reprieve, tariffs of 25 per cent will be imposed on imports from Mexico and Canada — America’s two biggest trading partners. Likewise, the US president will levy import taxes of 25 per cent on cars and car parts coming into the US. Steel and aluminium tariffs have already been imposed, as well as punitive measures on goods entering from China.

“We have been ripped off by every country in the world, friend and foe,” the president said this month.

Although the fate of the aerospace sector remains to be seen, Airbus is preparing for new import taxes that would have big implications for an industry where semi-finished goods cross borders multiple times.

US aerospace tariffs are expected in order to protect Boeing, the plane maker that has historically been the country’s biggest exporter by value.

Trump, however, has been more sparing with his praise for Airbus’s American rival since returning to the White House in January. In 2017, he lauded Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner jet as a “beautiful aeroplane”, but the company’s delayed delivery of two new Air Force One planes has led to the US president being more critical during his second term. “No, I’m not happy with Boeing … we gave that contract out a long time ago,” Trump said in February.

Despite his apparent misgivings, Trump awarded the Virginia-based company a $20 billion (£15.5 billion) contract this month to build the US military’s next-generation F-47 fighter jet.

Faury, chief executive of the €132 billion (£110 billion) Airbus since 2019, said that Airbus had done extensive planning for US import taxes. “In all of the different scenarios that we have looked at, they are either so bad for both sides that you need to come to a resolution; or it’s so imbalanced that the one putting tariffs on is suffering a lot,” he said.

“[In the latter scenario] there will then come a point where the industry says we need support so we can get out of this situation. A bit like we have heard from the car industry going to Washington and asking for ways of dealing with the situation because it would be too harmful.”

Airbus has beefed up its presence in the US in recent years. The company employs 5,000 people in America across the commercial aircraft, helicopters, space and defence sectors.

Faury said: “We are in the position to serve the US from the US. That’s one of the things we did, eyes open, and accelerated after the tariffs we had to suffer five years ago [during Trump’s first term]. We have a bit more experience when it comes to tariffs compared with other industries.”

‘Bigger’ hydrogen planes

Faury’s comments on US tariffs came as the most influential executive in commercial aviation insisted that Airbus had not given up on developing hydrogen-powered aircraft.

The aircraft maker told staff in February that the rollout of its hydrogen aircraft was “expected to come later than 2035” — the date it had previously targeted. It subsequently emerged that the timeline had been pushed back by five to ten years and the programme’s budget cut by a quarter.

“We continue to believe that hydrogen will be part of the solution,” he said.

Faury, 57, said that there was more to do to optimise the aircraft. “What we had not forecast or understood is that it will take much more time for the so-called hydrogen ecosystem to grow.

• The ‘albatross’ folding wing helping Airbus go green

“There is no point running a plane on green hydrogen if there is no green hydrogen available at scale.” Green hydrogen is a version of the gas made from renewable power sources.

Pressing ahead with the previous timescale risked producing a “sort of ‘Concorde of hydrogen’, where we would have a solution but one that would not be commercially viable at scale”, he told delegates at a conference in Toulouse last Monday.

Previous iterations of Airbus’s “ZEROe” programme envisaged a hydrogen fuel cell-powered plane that could carry up to 100 passengers with a range of 1,850km.

Faury said that delaying the project could allow for the development of a larger plane. “We were targeting about 100 [seats] … I think it is quite likely that we will end up with more room,” he said.

As Airbus grapples with hydrogen, Faury issued a further warning on the long-term viability of quotas for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — seen by many as the industry’s only tool to decarbonise at scale.

Worries over sustainable aviation fuel

SAF is made in a number of ways, including from used cooking waste, clothes and tyres.

Quotas stipulate that it must represent 2 per cent of total aviation fuel burnt in the UK in 2025, rising to 10 per cent in 2030, and 22 per cent by 2040. Similar rules in the EU also require 2 per cent in 2025, but rise moderately in the early years to 6 per cent by 2030 and 20 per cent by 2035.

It is the ramp-up beyond 2030 that concerns Faury. This is because airlines will increasingly look to source SAF from countries that are able to produce it more cheaply. In extreme cases, this could lead to airlines burning extra fuel as they “tanker” it from those countries selling cut-price SAF.

“The beginning of the trajectory is very reasonable,” he said. “I am a bit more worried that we need a level playing field on a global scale to have the real successful development of SAF.

“If you want SAF to go beyond 15-25 per cent, the fragmentation of the regulatory framework recreates big differences in competitiveness. That is the thing that will slow down SAF.”

Unlike hydrogen power, SAF is a “drop-in” fuel — meaning that aircraft engines need few changes to operate on it, and it can be easily blended with traditional jet fuel.

Faury said that if global SAF quotas can be harmonised, and sufficient production secured, standard combustion aircraft engines will still be operating for the rest of the 21st century.

“[By then] the transition to SAF will have happened to a large extent, maybe completely,” he said.

“I am very optimistic that we will find [enough] SAF, over time.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fdd584e19-d751-4f8c-8015-6cefd97e0dad.jpg?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-03-29 21:56:53.407034

As the aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as a viable solution to significantly lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. SAF is a “drop-in” fuel that meets the same technical and safety requirements as traditional fossil-based jet fuel while offering a more sustainable alternative.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

SAF is chemically similar to conventional jet fuel but is derived from the food and yard waste portion of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, fats/greases/oils, and other feedstocks and agricultural residues. Unlike fossil fuels, SAF sources hydrocarbons from more sustainable origins, leading to a net reduction in emissions on a life cycle basis.

To qualify as SAF under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), the fuel must meet two primary sustainability criteria:

Achieve at least a 10% net GHG emissions reduction compared to baseline fossil jet fuel emissions.

Not be produced from biomass sourced from land with high carbon stock.

Additionally, SAF cannot be derived from edible feedstocks that compete with food production. The fuel is refined and blended with traditional jet fuel in approved ratios before certification, ensuring seamless integration into existing aviation infrastructure.

How Does SAF Reduce Emissions?

A common misconception is that SAF directly reduces tailpipe CO₂ emissions. The real emissions reductions stem from the fuel’s life cycle assessment, including feedstock origin and induced land use change effects.

Current Adoption and Industry Efforts

Since its first commercial use in 2016, SAF has fueled hundreds of thousands of flights, with supply points expanding across major airports. However, production remains limited.

The U.S. and global aviation sectors have set ambitious SAF targets:

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge aims to increase U.S. SAF production to 3 billion gallons by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050.

Engine manufacturers are developing systems capable of running on 100% SAF, eliminating the need for blending in the future.

Challenges and Next Steps

Despite its potential, widespread SAF adoption faces hurdles:

High production costs: SAF is currently more expensive than conventional jet fuel, limiting widespread airline uptake.

Feedstock availability: Sustainable sources must be carefully managed to prevent adverse environmental and food security impacts.

Infrastructure limitations: Expanding refining capacity and distribution networks requires substantial investment.

SAF Book and Claim

Book and claim is a system that allows buyers to purchase a specified amount of SAF and claim the associated emissions reduction, even if they do not physically use the fuel themselves. This method separates the fuel’s physical distribution from its climate benefits, enabling organisations to support SAF adoption without direct access to it.

Neste’s Impact solution aligns with the Science Based Targets initiative, ensuring businesses can credibly report emissions savings from their SAF purchases, reinforcing their sustainability commitments.

“In simple terms, many organisations are eager to reduce their Scope 3 emissions by using SAF, but they may not have direct access to it. A book and claim system provides a practical way for them to start cutting emissions,” explains Susanne Bouma, Head of Customer Experience and Offer Management, Renewable Products at Neste, a leading producer of SAF.

Using the book and claim scheme is a fantastic way to add more sustainable fuel into the pool of overral jet fuel used around the world.

Immaginiamo un nuovo Airbus single-aisle aircraft con ali progettate con aerodinamica avanzata e biomimicry per generare significativamente più portanza, riducendo il consumo di carburante e incrementando l’efficienza. I suoi motori consumeranno il 20% in meno di carburante rispetto ai modelli attuali, rendendo il viaggio più decarbonizzato ed economico. Per supportare ulteriormente i guadagni nei consumi realizzati con i miglioramenti dei motori, Airbus prevede un ruolo crescente per le hybridisation and electrification technologies.

L’aeromobile verrà costruito con materiali più leggeri ma più forti, consentendo aerei più resistenti e più facili da gestire. Inoltre, Airbus sta adottando un approccio olistico per l’integrazione di una nuova system platform che includerà la smart automation non solo all’interno dell’aeromobile, ma anche nelle operazioni di terra e nella manutenzione.

Queste innovazioni trasformeranno il modo in cui gli aeromobili sono costruiti, operati e mantenuti, preparando le basi per una nuova era (leggi anche qui)”.

“Le ali degli aeromobili si sono evolute in modo significativo sia nel design che nella funzionalità sin dai primi giorni del volo. Le prime ali erano semplici, piatte e dritte, basate sull’aerodinamica di base per ottenere la portanza e realizzate con materiali basici come il legno. Con il progredire dell’ingegneria nel corso degli anni, le ali sono diventate più aerodinamiche e curve, ottimizzando la portanza e riducendo la resistenza, per performance migliori.

Rispetto a dove sono iniziate, le ali degli aeromobili di oggi possono sembrare all’apice dell’innovazione. Ma Airbus ritiene che ci sia ancora un mondo di possibilità per migliorare la progettazione delle ali. Nel 2023 la società ha aperto il Wing Technology Development Centre presso il suo sito di Filton, Regno Unito. È sede del Wing of Tomorrow (WoT) research and technology programme, che è fortemente coinvolto nella progettazione dell’ala per la futura prossima generazione di aeromobili. Ma il programma va oltre la progettazione, mirando a migliorare le nuove tecnologie di produzione e assemblaggio delle ali.

Sebbene i dettagli tecnici siano tenuti strettamente segreti, alcune delle possibilità per una nuova ala sono già state divulgate pubblicamente, la più importante delle quali è una folding wing. Ciò conferisce all’aereo un’apertura alare più elevata in volo, aumentando la portanza e riducendo la resistenza, pur rendendolo compatibile con i gate degli aeroporti”, afferma Airbus.

“Similmente alle ali, l’industria aeronautica ha progredito attraverso vari modelli di motori nel corso dei decenni, migliorando costantemente la fuel efficiency, le performance e la sicurezza del propulsion system. Mentre i motori a pistoni dei primi aerei fornivano la spinta necessaria per decollare, erano limitati in termini di efficienza e velocità. Il turbojet engine, introdotto per la prima volta negli anni ’50, ha cambiato per sempre l’aviazione e le ha permesso di diffondersi in tutto il mondo. L’attuale motore turbofan offre una migliore fuel efficiency e meno rumore, il che lo ha portato a diventare lo standard nell’aviazione commerciale moderna.

Per portare le cose al livello successivo, Airbus sta studiando il potenziale di alcune promettenti tecnologie di motori. Uno dei principali contendenti è l’open fan. Un open fan engine è molto diverso da un moderno turbofan, poiché le fan blades che generano la spinta sono più grandi e non sono contenute in una nacelle. Ciò consente all’aria di muoversi in modo efficiente attraverso il motore, riducendo il consumo di carburante.

Airbus sta lavorando con gli esperti di CFM sul Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) open fan engine demonstrator, che mira a mostrare come questa tecnologia potrebbe ridurre il consumo di carburante e le emissioni di CO2 del 20% rispetto ai single-aisle engines più efficienti di oggi. Airbus prevede di testare in volo RISE sul suo A380 flight test aircraft entro la fine del decennio”, prosegue Airbus.

“Hybridisation significa combinare diverse fonti di energia invece di affidarsi esclusivamente al jet fuel. Questo si presenta in diverse forme. Innanzitutto, la prossima generazione di aeromobili Airbus sarà in grado di volare con una fino a 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Poiché il SAF può ridurre le emissioni di carbonio del ciclo di vita fino all’80% rispetto al tradizionale jet fuel, questo standard di compatibilità sarà una leva fondamentale per aiutare le compagnie aeree a raggiungere il loro obiettivo di decarbonizzazione.

Ma il SAF non è l’unico modo per ridurre le emissioni. Airbus sta anche lavorando per far progredire la hybrid-electric propulsion, che integra l’uso del jet fuel convenzionale o del SAF con l’elettricità da batterie o fuel cells. Ciò ha il potenziale per ridurre le emissioni di carbonio di un aeromobile fino al 5%. Proprio come le automobili ibride, l’electric hybridisation può ridurre il consumo di carburante utilizzando energia altrimenti sprecata per alimentare non-propulsive functions.

L’EcoPulse demonstrator, un progetto congiunto tra Airbus, Daher e Safran, ha fornito informazioni significative sull’uso di batterie agli ioni di litio a bordo di un aereo con un high-voltage network. Airbus sta anche esplorando il potenziale delle solid-state batteries, che potrebbero fornire un equilibrio ottimale di energia e potenza in uscita per la prossima generazione di aeromobili. Queste batterie potrebbero essere utilizzate per alimentare l’aereo durante il rullaggio a terra, nonché durante il volo per funzioni di bordo come l’air conditioning system o l’illuminazione”, continua Airbus.

“Proprio come le ali e il sistema di propulsione, i materiali utilizzati per costruire gli aeromobili si sono evoluti in modo significativo da quando l’airframe in legno del Wright Flyer ha effettuato il suo primo volo. Il legno è stato sostituito dall’alluminio nei primi decenni di volo, che a sua volta ha iniziato a essere sostituito da carbon-fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) negli anni ’80, poiché la sua resistenza superiore e il peso più leggero hanno migliorato la fuel efficiency. Anche il titanio ha anche assunto un ruolo chiave negli aeromobili moderni, in quanto è abbastanza resistente da essere utilizzato per componenti aeronautici ad alto stress ma pesa meno dell’acciaio.

Nel complesso, i materiali sono passati dall’essere più deboli e pesanti all’essere ora ad alta resistenza e leggeri. Ciò ha portato a miglioramenti nella sicurezza, nella fuel efficiency e nelle performance degli aeromobili. Ma Airbus ritiene che ci siano ancora molti progressi da fare. Un percorso chiave per il miglioramento è la ricerca su come biomass composites and thermoplastics potrebbero sostituire le CFRP e il progresso mirato non si limita alla riduzione del peso. Airbus sta anche cercando di rendere il processo di produzione degli aeromobili sia più sostenibile, scegliendo materiali più facilmente riciclabili, sia più efficiente, con meno sprechi e un assemblaggio più rapido.

Un esempio di questo tipo di miglioramenti è il Multifunctional Fuselage Demonstrator (MFFD), un programma guidato da Airbus nell’ambito della Clean Sky 2 Large Aircraft platform. Utilizzando carbon fibre-reinforced thermoplastic polymer composites (CFRTP) al posto di CFRP, il dimostratore ha raggiunto il suo obiettivo di risparmio di peso a un costo neutro e ha anche dimostrato una maggiore efficienza di produzione. Il CFRTP è anche più facile da riutilizzare e riciclare rispetto ad altri materiali”, prosegue Airbus.

“Airbus ha sconvolto il mercato degli aeromobili commerciali negli anni ’80 quando ha introdotto la tecnologia fly-by-wire sull’A320. Sostituendo i comandi meccanici con quelli digitali, la sicurezza, la manovrabilità e l’affidabilità dell’aeromobile sono state migliorate. Presto adottato dall’intero settore, il fly-by-wire definisce la quarta generazione di aeromobili che volano oggi.

Sebbene il fly-by-wire sia ora lo standard del settore, non è la fine della strada. Airbus sta progettando una common digital platform per un future next-generation single aisle, che garantirà operazioni più sicure ed efficienti. Questi sistemi futuri saranno altamente connessi e automatizzati, alimentati da piattaforme informatiche avanzate. Ciò consentirà automatic installation, updates and modifications delle system applications, consentendo miglioramenti immediati per incrementare le performance. Allo stesso tempo, le maggiori velocità di elaborazione supportate dall’intelligenza artificiale aumenteranno la quantità di dati che possono essere elaborati in modo sicuro. Ciò faciliterà la predictive maintenance e migliorerà l’esperienza dei passeggeri attraverso la disponibilità di informazioni in tempo reale.

La sicurezza, la massima priorità di Airbus, sarà ulteriormente rafforzata anche attraverso l’incremento di automatic assistance technologies per i piloti, aiutandoli a gestire operazioni complesse con maggiore precisione. Questa automatic assistance sarà estesa anche all’esterno del cockpit, a ground operations and maintenance”, conclude Airbus.

Sono alcune delle caratteristiche dell’aereo di nuova generazione di Airbus destinato a sostituire la famiglia degli A320 a corridoio singolo, il più venduto di sempre, svelate durante il summit sull’aviazione sostenibile a Tolosa. I tempi sono ancora lunghi e per il suo decollo bisognerà attendere dai dieci ai 15 anni, ma di certo vedrà la luce prima dell’avveniristico velivolo alimentato ad idrogeno del produttore europeo, lancio previsto nel 2035, posticipato a data da definire.

«Abbiamo gli ingredienti e la ricetta - ha detto Bruno Fichefeux, Head of Future Programs di Airbus -. Ora si tratta di capitalizzare quanto di meglio abbiamo realizzato finora per compiere un nuovo salto in avanti». E il nuovo passaggio va nella direzione dell’aviazione sostenibile con la diminuzione fino all’azzeramento delle emissioni nocive nell’aria entro il 2050.

Obiettivo ambizioso per un settore che inquina tra il 2% e il 3% delle emissioni globali di CO2, ma con una combinazione di carburanti alternativi, nuove tecnologie e nuovi aeromobili con ali più lunghe e più leggere sarà possibile raggiungere se non avvicinarsi al target, almeno secondo i tecnici e gli ingegneri di Airbus. Uno degli ingredienti per rendere meno inquinante l’aereo del futuro è il motore Open Fan che a Tolosa stanno studiando insieme a CFM, la joint venture tra la statunitense GE Aerospace e la francese Safran: il propulsore ha dimensioni maggiori, si colloca esternamente alla casula, costringendo a modificare l’aerodinamica dell’aereo. «Una delle novità importanti è la tecnologia Open Fan - ha confermato Fichefeux -. La stiamo sviluppando. Abbiamo un piano per eseguire test di volo» che tuttavia non inizieranno prima della fine di questo decennio.

A confermare le capacità del nuovo propulsore è Mohamad Ali, senior vice president e chief technology di GE Aerospace: «Con il nuovo motore sarà possibile un risparmio di carburante superiore al 20% rispetto alla tecnologia attuale». Airbus non ha scelto alcuna configurazione di motori ed è in trattativa anche con Rolls-Royce e Pratt & Whitney, i principali concorrenti di CFM International, per valutare eventuali alternative.

Un altro ingrediente è il carburante, ovvero il SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), al momento l’unica alternativa ai kerosene per aviazione, ma ancora troppo costoso e disponibile in quantità non sufficienti alle esigenze del settore: il SAF viene già utilizzato dalle compagnie aeree al 2% miscelato al carburante tradizionale, ma in prospettiva l’obiettivo è di aumentare questa quota fino al 100% rispetto alla miscela massima al 50% consentita sugli attuali aeromobili Airbus.",https://i2.res.24o.it/images2010/S24/Documenti/2025/03/27/Immagini/Ritagli/Airbus1-U32758021311ivS-1440x752@IlSole24Ore-Web.jpg?r=1170x507,N,,2025-03-29 16:56:26.315007

Specifically, the Massachusetts-based company is leveraging low-cost renewable energy, carbon dioxide, and water to make a ready-to-use, carbon-neutral jet fuel alternative. It comes with astounding 95% lower heat-trapping gas emissions, all according to a press release.

The latest news involves the successful testing of a North Carolina pilot station.

""In less than three years, we've moved from concept to pilot, which marks a pivotal step toward our long-term goal of decarbonizing aviation,"" CEO Joe Rodden said in the statement.

Aviation is widely reported to account for about 2.5% of worldwide, energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. The fume volume has accelerated faster than rail, road, or shipping since 2000, according to the International Energy Agency.

Once spewed, the exhaust contributes to our planet's warming. Massachusetts Institute of Technology experts said the higher temperatures, combined with natural weather patterns, play a part in worsening severe weather and harmful ocean warming — conditions already being realized.

Many flights use sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, which is a non-petroleum product that has reduced emissions compared to conventional fuels, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

But Lydian's team thinks it can make it much cleaner. Its process collects abundant carbon dioxide — partially generated from planes themselves — and sends it to specialized synthetic gas production tech, where water is added. Low-cost renewable energy powers the transformation happening inside a shipping container-sized unit. The syngas is then sent to a fuel synthesis station, where it's made ready to power aircraft, all per a Lydian rendering that details the process.

Part of the efficiency comes by operating only when renewable power can be bought at low prices. By running at ideal times, the process avoids extreme energy expenses typical to power-to-liquid operations. What's more, the strategic electricity use doesn't strain the grid and avoids competition for valuable electricity, all per the release.

The pilot operation can produce 25 gallons of e-fuel daily, which represents massive progress for Lydian. But it's not much when considering that big aircraft can burn that amount in minutes, TechCrunch noted.

The team includes NASA, Stanford, and MIT experts. By 2030, the plan is to be making 20 million gallons of fuel per year for commercial flights and even for the Department of Defense, all per the release.

""This pilot showcases the viability of our novel technology to produce SAF and our ability to scale toward commercial production in record time,"" Rodden said.

Hydrogen fuel is another alternative being developed for flight and transportation. But it isn't entirely clean, depending on how it's made and used, as noted by the Sierra Club. And even syngas has some flammability and toxicity concerns that could result from uncontrolled releases, according to ScienceDirect.

For their part, carbon neutral efforts are geared to remove as much CO2 from the air as the operation — or in this case flights and fuel production — generate. Meta and other companies are investing in solar farms to offset energy demand for their growing data centers, as another example.

Anyone can help to remove air pollution from the environment by planting trees. One mature tree absorbs 48 pounds of CO2 annually, according to the Arbor Day Foundation. By letting native plants and flowers grow in your yard, you can also help pollinator health, which is crucial to our food supply.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lydianimage-recpgHcxq5i9eMG2R-e1743270159221.jpg,N,,2025-03-29 15:56:30.992329

Zrównoważone paliwo lotnicze (sustainable aviation fuel, SAF) to jeden z najgłośniejszych tematów w branży lotniczej w ostatnich latach. Od początku 2025 r. przewoźnicy mają obowiązek stosować 2 proc. SAF w mieszance paliwa lotniczego, aby obniżać emisje dwutlenku węgla. Nadal jest jednak problem z jego zdobyciem. Międzynarodowe Zrzeszenie Przewoźników Powietrznych IATA zwraca uwagę, że choć jest obowiązek jego stosowania, nie ma zachęt do zwiększenia produkcji przez koncerny paliwowe.

- Od pierwszego lotu braci Wright nastąpił fantastyczny rozwój lotnictwa. Zaledwie 60 lat dzieli go od Boeinga 707. Ale przełomowe technologie skończyły się 60 lat temu. Jeśli spojrzeć na 1960 i 2025 rok, to samoloty wyglądają tak samo. Oczywiście są znacznie bezpieczniejsze, wydajniejsze, zużywają mniej paliwa i są cichsze. Mamy jednak problem z CO2, więc oczywiste jest, że musimy zacząć od nowa. Czy SAF jest przełomem? Nie. To sposób na kontynuowanie optymalizacji i samoloty dokładnie takie jak teraz - mówił Bertrand Piccard.

Jeśli nie zużyty olej kuchenny, to co?

Zamiana konwencjonalnego paliwa lotniczego na SAF może pozwolić na obniżenie emisji dwutlenku węgla w tej gałęzi transportu o 70-80 proc. Skąd bierze się ""magia"" zrównoważonego paliwa lotniczego? Jak już pisaliśmy w money.pl, z matematyki.

- Podczas spalania emisja CO2 jest taka sama jak w przypadku paliwa kopalnego. Jednak w przypadku paliw kopalnych pobieramy surowiec z ziemi i uwalniamy dwutlenek węgla do atmosfery. W przypadku SAF surowiec już go pochłonął z atmosfery (tak jest w przypadku zużytego oleju spożywczego), więc mimo uwolnienia dwutlenku węgla w procesie spalania, nie dodaje żadnego ""nowego"" CO2 do atmosfery - tłumaczy Marjan Rozemeijer z KLM, w odpowiedzi na pytania Money.pl.

Dlatego Bertrand Piccard uważa, że SAF nie jest wcale najlepszym rozwiązaniem.

Wychwytujemy CO2 z oleju spożywczego, odpadów, starego plastiku, czegokolwiek. Zamieniamy go w paliwo i emitujemy z powrotem do atmosfery. W pewnym sensie jest więc neutralne, ale z drugiej strony może być negatywne. Mając dwutlenek węgla w swoich rękach można go umieścić w ziemi, gdziekolwiek, byle nie w atmosferze - przekonywał w Tuluzie.

Podczas wystąpienia w Tuluzie wskazał również na inne rozwiązania, które już dziś mogą pozwolić na dalszy rozwój lotnictwa cywilnego na masową skalę, a równocześnie przysłużyć się klimatowi i środowisku. Mimo to jednak nie są stosowane.

- Jeśli wykonujesz stałe podejście do lądowania (ang. continuous descent approach, CDA), zamiast robić to ""schodkami"", to jeden Boeing 747 oszczędza tonę paliwa lotniczego na każde takie lądowanie. Można latać nad oceanami w eskadrach, dokładnie tak jak robią to ptaki. Daje to oszczędność 20-30 proc. paliwa. Można mieć bezpośrednie trasy z punktu A do punktu B. Ale każdy kraj chce mieć możliwość wystawiania faktur liniom lotniczym za żeglugę powietrzną po drodze. Więc jest to problem polityczny - mówił Piccard.

Kim jest Bertrand Piccard? Pionier lotnictwa w XXI wieku

Bertrand Piccard to 67-letni szwajcarski lekarz psychiatra i podróżnik. Jego ojciec jako pierwszy zbadał dno Rowu Mariańskiego, dziadek - konstruował batyskafy i balony stratosferyczne. W 1999 r. Bertrand Piccard wraz z Brianem Jonesem w 15 dni okrążyli Ziemię balonem bez międzylądowania. W 2003 r. razem z André Borschbergiem (pilotem) zainaugurowali projekt Solar Impulse, który doprowadził do budowy samolotu słonecznego. Już w 2010 r. wykonał on 26-godzinny nieprzerwany lot, również w nocy. Pięć lat później nowsza wersja - Solar Impulse 2 okrążyła świat, startując z Abu Dhabi. Najdłuższy etap tej podróży trwał 118 godzin.

Dwie godziny do Sydney? ""To jest możliwe""

- Gdy leciałem dookoła świata samolotem napędzanym energią słoneczną, był to samolot elektryczny z bateriami. I zauważyliśmy, że potrzeba 36 kg baterii, aby uzyskać odpowiednik 1 kg nafty lotniczej. To niezbyt optymistyczne. Silnik elektryczny jest trzy razy bardziej wydajny niż silnik cieplny. Potrzebujesz tej samej ilości energii, aby pokonać trzy razy większą odległość. Myślę, że to wodór jest dziś szansą na kolejny przełom technologiczny w lotnictwie - podkreślił Piccard w Tuluzie.

Obecnie tworzy projekt Climate Impulse - w 2028 r. chce ponownie wyruszyć w 9-dniowy lot dookoła świata zupełnie nowym samolotem zeroemisyjnym. Tym razem na wodór. Procent zaawansowania budowy swojego samolotu określił na 30 proc.

- Jeśli wyobrazimy sobie następny krok, to będzie to samolot z setką pasażerów, ciekłym wodorem i ciekłym tlenem, dokładnie jak w rakietach Ariane. Wystartuje z Tuluzy, osiągnie wysokość 100 km, po 15 minutach wyłączy silnik, lecąc parabolicznie w locie suborbitalnym i dotrze do Sydney w ciągu dwóch godzin. To właśnie jest wodór. Pewnie trudno będzie polecieć tak z Paryża do Londynu, ale dalekie podróże się zmienią - wyjaśniał.

Moja praca zakończy się w 2028 r. Bo pionierzy potrzebni są na początku, aby otworzyć drogę. Ale wtedy zacznie się wasza praca [zwrócił się do szefostwa Airbusa - przyp. red.], aby to zaistniało na poziomie komercyjnym. To jest możliwe - przekonywał Piccard.

Abschließend werden die vielversprechendsten Kandidaten unter realen Bedingungen im Flugzeug getestet. Dabei geht es nicht nur um die reine CO₂-Bilanz, sondern auch um Wechselwirkungen mit bestehenden Triebwerken, die Bildung von Stickoxiden oder Rußpartikeln sowie die Frage, wie sich die Kraftstoffe langfristig auf Wartung und Sicherheit auswirken.

Embraer is currently one of the leading aircraft manufacturers in the world; specializing in the production of commercial passenger aircraft, military aircraft and agricultural aircraft.

In 2024, Embraer will have about 24,000 employees, operating in 80 countries around the world, with revenue of about 6.4 billion USD.

Previously, during his official visit to Brazil (September 2023), Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh visited Embraer's aircraft manufacturing plant and worked with President Francisco Gomes Neto in Brazil. On the occasion of attending the G20 Summit in Brazil (November 2024), the Prime Minister also received the Global Vice President of Embraer Group.

Embraer aircraft (E190) has been certified by the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam to be allowed to operate in Vietnam since December 2020. In December 2024, Embraer brought a number of military aircraft (C-390 Millennium multi-role transport) to participate in the Vietnam Defense Exhibition. Currently, Embraer and Vietnamese airlines are promoting aircraft purchase contracts.

Pleased to meet again with Mr. Francisco Gomes Neto, President of Embraer Group, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh hopes that Embraer's relationship with Vietnam will become increasingly closer and more effective, in the spirit of unlimited cooperation between the two countries.

The Prime Minister said that with a dynamically developing economy, Vietnam currently has great potential and growing demand in the aviation sector; identifying the aviation and aerospace industry as playing an important role in exploiting new development spaces, including outer space.

Specifically, the Prime Minister suggested that Embraer cooperate with Vietnamese partners to produce aviation equipment, contributing to the development of the aviation industry through the transfer of modern technology, training of high-quality human resources, technical support and experience exchange.

Along with that, cooperate in providing aircraft at preferential prices, cooperate in building aircraft maintenance and repair service centers; research and develop renewable and sustainable aviation fuel, implement emission reduction measures, and promote greening the aviation industry.

The Prime Minister requested relevant agencies and partners to promptly carry out procedures according to regulations to effectively implement projects, contributing to concretizing high-level agreements during President Lula da Silva's visit to Vietnam, making the aviation industry a breakthrough cooperation field in the bilateral relations in the coming time.

The Prime Minister affirmed that the Vietnamese Government is committed to always accompanying and sharing with businesses, ensuring that businesses operate legally, healthily and effectively.

For his part, Mr. Francisco Gomes Neto sincerely thanked the Prime Minister for taking the time to meet him; said that Embraer highly appreciated the opportunity for cooperation and was very pleased to contribute to the development of Vietnam; wanted to introduce modern aircraft lines as well as cooperate in deploying aviation services.

Informing the Prime Minister about the activities and exchanges with Vietnamese partners during the visit, the Embraer Chairman said he is ready to work with Vietnamese partners to promote cooperation in the areas mentioned by the Prime Minister.

“We believe that climate risk and the opportunities around the energy transition are one of the most significantly mispriced financial risks in the markets today,” he said.
“We think about the impact of decarbonisation and climate risk on the companies that we’re providing capital to.
“And boy, climate change will create real problems.","Six major US banks — including JP Morgan, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs — left the Net Zero Banking Alliance in January on the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration as US president. Four Canadian banks followed, along with Macquarie, the Australian financial powerhouse, and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group from Japan.

• JPMorgan is latest lender to walk out of net zero banking group

Net zero, it seems, is in full retreat, with the Trump edict of “drill, baby, drill” ringing in its ears. And this is not just a US phenomenon. Friedrich Merz won the German election last month with an attack on his predecessor’s green policies, while Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has decided that the UK’s 2050 net-zero target is “impossible” to achieve without bankrupting the UK. Even Rachel Reeves, who once claimed an ambition to become Britain’s “first green chancellor”, said in January that growth “trumps” net zero as she backed the expansion of Heathrow.

Corporations the world over have read the mood music and are dancing to the new tune. In the past few weeks, BP has slashed investment in its renewable energy business and announced a scale-up of oil production; HSBC has moved its net-zero target back by 20 years; and even Bill Gates, a prophet of corporate environmentalism, has cut staff as he slims down his climate group Breakthrough Energy.

There was a time, not so long ago, when every corporation was desperate to crow about its green credentials, leading to accusations of “greenwashing”. Nowadays, any talk of CSR (corporate social responsibility), DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) or ESG (environmental, social and governance) is taboo. We have entered a new era of “greenhushing”.

“Companies are scared to talk about ESG, and particularly scared to talk about the positive impact they’re having on the world,” said Sebastian Leape, chief executive at Natcap, an Oxford University spin-out that measures and assesses companies’ interactions with nature.

It is no wonder they are fearful. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has threatened a clampdown on ESG-related activism by investors, with many fearing litigation.

The quandary facing global businesses is revealed in a section of the latest annual report by HSBC bank, published last month, where it admitted: “Our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our decision to participate, or not to participate, in certain projects perceived to be associated with causing or exacerbating climate change.”

When it comes to acting on climate change, in other words, it is a matter of damned if you do, damned if you don’t.

This contradiction is made all the more acute by the coincidence of the great green rollback with a series of events that have graphically illustrated what a significant force climate change can be. With temperatures last year breaching the totemic 1.5C threshold above pre-industrial temperatures, and the Los Angeles fires and Valencia floods raising the profile of environmental disasters even higher, many corporations are quietly taking the issue far more seriously than they have in the past.

Meanwhile coffee prices hit a record high of $4.34 per pound last month, up more than double in a year after droughts in Vietnam and Brazil and flooding in Indonesia. Cocoa prices have also soared after production fell 14 per cent last year due to similar unpredictable weather patterns. In England, farmers had their second-worst harvest since 1983 last year, following the wettest 18-month spell since records began.

Insurers also have a first-hand view of the impact of climate change. Lloyd’s of London put its losses from the California wildfires at $2.3 billion (£1.8 billion). According to the Association of British Insurers (ABI), a record £585 million was paid out for weather-related damage to homes and possessions in the UK last year.

Alison Taylor, clinical associate professor at New York University Stern School of Business, said: “We will perhaps see a shift away from climate as a consumer-facing poster child, which treats this topic as marketing. But anyone sourcing food, for example, is going to have to take this seriously because it’s not just a matter of corporate virtue signalling.”

JP Morgan — one of the very banks to have pulled out of Carney’s green banking alliance — published a report in February on “navigating the new climate era”. The company, where former Labour shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna is global head of sustainable solutions, said success in a warming world “hinges on our ability to integrate climate considerations into daily decision-making”. It added: “Those who adapt will lead, while others risk falling behind.”

HSBC last month made headlines with its noisy pushback of its net-zero operations target from 2030 to 2050. But the bank — where Sir Danny Alexander, former Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury, is head of infrastructure finance — also quietly revealed that it has increased its investment in the climate transition, with $99 billion invested in sustainable finance in the past year alone, double the $44 billion it spent in 2020.

Recent projects backed by HSBC include a wind-power manufacturing plant in Teesside, sustainable aviation fuel in Hong Kong and low-carbon clothing manufacture in India. All corporate credit applications and reviews at the bank now require an assessment of “climate risk factors”.

Will Evison, sustainability strategy director at the professional services firm PwC, said: “I’m OK with companies taking meaningful action, rather than just shouting about it. The level of action now, on both the climate and the nature transition, is fundamentally far greater than it was even a few years ago.”

Nick Stansbury, head of climate solutions for the asset management division of insurer Legal & General, said fund managers still take climate risk seriously when making investment decisions. “We believe that climate risk and the opportunities around the energy transition are one of the most significantly mispriced financial risks in the markets today,” he said.

“We think about the impact of decarbonisation and climate risk on the companies that we’re providing capital to. But we also think about the inverse of that … how good a job those companies are doing of leaning into the financial opportunities that the energy transition is going to create for them.”

One company seeking solutions is Bayer, the German biotech giant. “Our teams are looking into crops that can adapt to extreme weather,” said Matthias Berninger, Bayer’s head of public affairs, sustainability and safety. They are developing short-stem corn that is better able to survive storms, and rice that requires less water to grow.

“Rice is the number one staple food — 3.5 billion humans depend on it,” Berninger said. “Can we grow it with 30 or 40 per cent less water? We are also looking at crops better able to withstand insect pressures and fungal infections.”

Leape at Natcap said this attitude encapsulates the current mood among those engaging in sustainability. “It’s about self-interest. Companies are really engaging in this agenda, not because it’s politically correct but because it’s critical to achieving their business goals.”

Others, however, are using the political backlash against net zero to jettison targets that they never thought were feasible in the first place. Taylor at Stern School of Business said: “There was a consensus [in the past] that what companies should do was to set really ambitious goals they weren’t sure they were going to achieve, and try and bring other institutions along. There is now a collective realisation that they’re not going to meet those goals.

“So in that sense. the Trump crackdown comes at a very convenient time and allows a lot of companies to try and drop these issues.”

But there is a drawback to this approach, Taylor noted: “Everybody is at risk of looking like they shift in the breeze depending on who’s in power, and that they have no meaningful commitment to anything. And there is even more of a risk of alienating young employees and consumers.”

David Craig, founder of analytics provider Refinitiv and co-chair of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), believes that the backlash against corporate sustainability initiatives had been building for a while. “The sustainability community is slightly guilty, possibly, of focusing too much on top-down targets,” he said.

But Craig added that there had been a shift in mindset. “The corporate social responsibility model was ‘let’s do a few good things and show the world that we’re making up for some of the harm’. The mindset now is that this is core to the business and its resilience. Companies realise that if they do run out of natural materials or water, for example, they can’t run their factory any more.”

Berninger at Bayer put it a different way. “My very conservative, very traditional view is that businesses make money when they solve real problems,” he said. “And boy, climate change will create real problems.

“Businesses that invest in solving the problems will have a better prospect than those that do not.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fe2a88c88-fc94-4cde-bc2e-b3e7fc0e4e5a.jpg?crop=3072%2C1728%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-03-29 11:56:13.832817

Why not leave the Labour Party?
Mr Findlay, who supported the Better Together campaign in 2014, has at least had the decency to resign from the Labour Party, if for no other reason than to salve his conscience.","A significant part of the problem is our national debt. As Mark McGeoghegan points out (“This Labour government is devoid of the courage or ingenuity to meet today’s crises”, The Herald, March 28), it’s almost 100% of GDP, four times what it was in 1990. Interest payments on that debt will be over £100 billion this year, 8% of government spending; five years ago, when interest rates were low, the figure was £25 billion. We’ve maxed out the national credit card and are now at the mercy of the money markets.

It's not going to be easy to escape this dilemma. Austerity, as imposed by Rachel Reeves, won’t help; nor will borrowing more. A partial solution is offered in a report by the Wealth Tax Commission, which suggests a time-limited wealth tax would raise £260 billion if set at the rate of 1% for five years on those individuals with net assets of £500,000 or more (ie £1 million for a couple). That doesn’t sound over arduous when you consider the situation we’re in.

Beyond that, as a country we’re going to have to learn to live within our means. With an ageing population, spending on the NHS and social care is only going to increase at rates above inflation, and most other government departments are already cut to the bone. We’re going to have to accept that, if we want good public services, we’ll have to pay a bit more tax. Tax is often referred to as a burden, but it’s really the fee we pay to live in a decent society.

We’re also going to have to consider whether we can afford some of the freebies and subsidies currently offered universally, and that may include university tuition.

Doug Maughan, Dunblane.

Why not leave the Labour Party?

A few days before Polling Day at the 1983 UK General Election Neil Kinnock, then Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, made his famous ""I warn you"" speech in which he cautioned voters about the consequences of another Tory victory and the return of Margaret Thatcher. Kinnock's closing words in that speech were: ""I warn you not to fall ill. I warn you not to grow old."" After witnessing the actions of Rachel Reeves since the Labour Party came to power only eight months ago, those warning words of Neil Kinnock from 1983 now ring very hollow. Like many older Scottish voters I never thought we would see the day when a Labour Party Chancellor of the Exchequer would take actions to jeopardise the welfare of vulnerable people to the extent that even Margaret Thatcher herself might have thought was unacceptable.

More interesting however have been the reactions of Labour politicians to what has been taking place. In Scotland we have their leader at Holyrood, Anas Sarwar, staying silent on the matters concerned, as if trying to pretend that they weren't happening. Then we have a group of their Scottish MPs, apparently led by former Better Together campaign leader Blair McDougall, actually voting in favour of Ms Reeves' actions at Westminster. For their benefit I would advise them that proposals to withdraw the winter fuel payment from pensioners and then to cut payments to the sick and disabled did not appear on their party's manifesto prior to last July's election.

Finally, we have the other extreme in Scotland where the criticism of Labour's actions from two of their worthies, former MSP Neil Findlay and Brian Leishman MP, has been quite virulent. Mr Findlay, who supported the Better Together campaign in 2014, has at least had the decency to resign from the Labour Party, if for no other reason than to salve his conscience. Mr Leishman, on the other hand, has done plenty of well-publicised moaning from the sidelines, but little else. My question to Mr Leishman would be that if he is so opposed to the harm that his party is doing, why does he continue to remain a part of it?

• Ian Murray (""With the SNP unfit to handle money wisely, Labour will deliver renewal"", The Herald, March 27) says “but we are doing it [sound financial management] in a fair way, asking those with the broadest shoulders to pay their fair share, while protecting the most vulnerable”.

Surely such a cap-doffing hack as Ian Murray doesn’t really believe this? Has he been accepting too many tickets to fortune teller events? Sheer fantasy.

We should not subsidise rail

I agree with Mark Smith (""The £200m that’s being wasted on the wrong train line. Time for a rethink on rail policy"", The Herald, March 24) that money should not be spent on reducing train times between Glasgow and Aberdeen but disagree that it should be used to build new railways. There are excellent bus services between Aberdeen, Peterhead and Fraserburgh and no need for a train service.

He refers to the many new homes built near the Borders Railway but these are within the Edinburgh journey-to-work area. This means that many trains are heavily used for under four hours daily. That is a loss-making situation requiring public subsidies.

Already UK residents, only 30% of whom often use trains, pay £200 billion a year to subsidise them without being consulted. That is entirely undemocratic.Why should people in say, Newton Stewart, Kelso and Stornoway pay to build and run railways in Aberdeenshire or elsewhere any more than they should pay to provide parks there? In many countries there has long been a policy of requiring users to pay the costs of train services. That should be the case here.

There are far better ways of creating wealth and reducing inequality by using public money. Max Wiszniewski (""Scotland’s Land Reform Bill is broken, but there is a foolproof way to fix it"", The Herald, March 24) describes one of them: through land reform. It does not require spending huge amounts of taxpayers' money on infrastructure to benefit a tiny minority.

There are many other opportunities. Many more people who are rarely heard from should be better informed of possibilities and encouraged to make a case for providing these through cost-benefit analysis. It would be far better to have a large number of small projects which can be soon implemented than a few very costly showy ones which could take ages to implement and may become disasters like HS2.

Policies should not be mainly under the control of narrow self-serving interest groups who want others to fund their pet projects.

This fuel is a green smokescreen

The fire at one of the substations that provides power to Heathrow provided a reminder of the many hundreds of flights that the airport handles every day. Chancellor Reeves justified the recent Government announcement supporting a series of airport expansions by stating that ""sustainable aviation fuel"" (SAF) was a ""game changer"" that will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 70 per cent. Currently the UK is committed to a 2% SAF content in aviation kerosene and is providing £63 million to boost production. To date this is predominantly derived from used cooking oil, 80% of which is imported from China and Malaysia.

It is planned that the SAF content will increase to 22% by 2040 by which time it is forecast that passenger numbers will have doubled, equating globally to 200,000 flights day consuming over 18 million barrels of aviation fuel. This will necessitate the use of multiple sources of feedstock such as municipal waste, sewage and a vast area of land dedicated to growing bioenergy crops. These are already grown on a massive scale to provide the E10 element in the petrol, thus further reducing the area of land available for growing food.

Alternatively SAF could be produced in the form of green hydrogen but this would require up to 3.4 times more wind and solar capacity than at present. Clearly the Chancellor has not taken the trouble to read the report from the Royal Society which concludes that this course of action could be up to 69% more carbon-intensive than using standard kerosene jet fuel and could result in ""unacceptable collateral ecological damage"". Airline operators may be keen to be seen as environmentally responsible but in reality they and the Chancellor are hiding behind another green smokescreen that fails to stand up to robust scrutiny.

Neil J Bryce, Kelso.

• Rather than worry about sustainable aviation fuel, why not do a proper problem-solving exercise and find out why there has been such an increase in air travel, despite the advent of instant electronic global communication?

Such an exercise might reveal the true situation, and the correct answer, rather than a knee-jerk response that could be wrong.

Malcolm Parkin, Kinross.

Education should be secular

The philosopher AC Grayling said that the major reason for the continuance of religious belief in a world which might otherwise have long moved beyond it is indoctrination of children before they reach the age of reason. Norwood Primary School in Eastleigh, Hants, has sent a letter to parents and carers informing them that the Easter Service would not be held this year ""in the spirit of inclusivity and respect for the diverse religious beliefs represented within our school community"".

We live in a multi-racial, multi-cultural, principally secular society. By educating children from all backgrounds together, without emphasis on any particular religion, there is a far greater chance of mutual understanding and personal friendships. Enthusiasts of all faiths oppose secular education because exposure to other traditions has the effect of loosening the grip of their own. The steady move away from Christianity in this country may be traced to a number of factors: education, apathy, immigration and the well-documented incidence of paedophilia and child molestation among some Christian clerics. Christianity should have its privileged position in our schools removed. Religion-free morals – which predate by centuries their Christian counterparts – are freely available.

Prioritizing fuel efficiency in aircraft design Plane makers are committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
Electric aircraft may contribute to these advancements, with Airbus developing a hydrogen-based aircraft to reduce carbon emissions by up to 100%.","Fuel economy in air transport is achieved through the efficiency of the aircraft and engine model combined with airline efficiency factors like seating configuration and loading factor. This makes commercial airlines look to operate advanced fuel-efficient planes, which advance profitability and produce fewer emissions, including carbon dioxide, which is a major contributor to climate change.

In terms of fuel efficiency, the leading long haul aircraft is the Airbus A330neo widebody aircraft, offering the lowest operating cost and fuel consumption per seat, equal to 2.1 liters per passenger per 100 kilometers. This means that, on average, an A330neo consumes 2.1 liters of fuel to transport one passenger over a distance of 100 kilometers. It measures fuel efficiency on passenger transport, indicating a fuel-efficient aircraft or operation.

This is compared to 8–9 liters per 100 kilometers for a mid-sized SUV. With 4 passengers, this becomes 2–2.25 liters per 100 kilometers per passenger, which is favorable to the aircraft.

The most fuel-efficient long-haul aircraft

The A330neo is the most fuel-efficient long-haul aircraft in 2025. Thanks to its winning engine-airframe combination, it delivers a 25% lower fuel burn for operators in commercial aviation. It is the first aircraft to be certified by EASA for ICAO’s new CO2 emissions standard, confirming its ability to comply with future environmental regulations. The first A330neo was delivered to TAP Air Portugal on 15 May 2018.

Its versatility makes it suitable for various short and long-haul routes, maximizing efficiency in different operational environments. According to Airbus, the A330neo offers a 25% reduction in fuel burn per seat and 25% lower maintenance costs, including longer check intervals and fewer fatigue tasks. In 2024, Airbus received 82 orders for the A330, indicating a continued interest in the aircraft without any order cancelations.

On November 29, 2024, Airbus delivered its first A330neo to Malaysia Airlines . The aircraft features a premium two-class layout with 297 seats, 28 fully flat business class suites, and an all-new 269 Economy seats. Virgin Atlantic's neos, received in July 2022, is configured with 262 seats—156 in standard economy, 28 in Economy Delight, 46 in Premium economy, and 32 in Upper Class, including the two Retreat Suites.

According to Malaysian Airlines, the A330neo flies daily to Melbourne effective 18 March 2025, with four weekly flights to Auckland effective 13 March 2025 and three weekly flights to Bali effective 16 March 2025 in a truly Malaysian interior.

More fuel-efficient long-haul leading aircraft

When comparing the most fuel-efficient advanced Airbus and Boeing aircraft models, according to i6, an expert group in aviation operations—Boeing B787-10, Airbus A350-1000, Boeing B787-8, and Airbus A350-900 rank at the top level. However, each is tailored for specific operational needs, blending efficiency, range, and capacity in unique ways.

The Boeing B787-9 and -10 place as the second most fuel-efficient modern aircraft, combined with the flexibility of a mid-sized seating capacity, makes it an excellent choice for long-haul routes with moderate demand. Boeing B787-9 key data are:

Fuel Efficiency: 2.31 L/100km per passenger.

Seating Capacity (multi-class layout): 290 passengers

Range: 8,787 miles (14,140 km).

Fuel Capacity: 126,372 liters (33,385 gallons).

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner , powered by the Trent 1000, is 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. Rolls-Royce aims to remain a leader in widebody commercial aircraft engines. The engine offers the highest bypass ratio (10:1) of any Trent engine, with a more stable operating cycle.

The Boeing B787-10 features 2.31 L/100km per passenger, marginally edging out both Airbus A350 models, which share 2.39 Liters. The Boeing B787-8, while an earlier-generation model, lags slightly at 2.77 L/100km per PAX. These efficiency figures can greatly influence operating costs, especially on long-haul routes, making the B787-10 particularly attractive for commercial air carriers.

Seating capacity showcases the adaptability of these aircraft. The Airbus A350-1000 accommodates the most passengers (350 in a multi-class layout), followed by the Airbus A350-900 (315), Boeing B787-10 (330), and the smaller Boeing B787-8 (242). Airlines looking to serve high-demand routes might favor the A350-1000's larger capacity, while the B787-8’s reduced size suits thinner routes with less demand.

The Airbus A350-900 and the A350-1000 are powered by the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 and Trent XWB-97, respectively, two new-generation high-thrust engines. The Trent XWB-84, with 84,000lb thrust, is set to improve fuel and CO2 efficiency by 1%, while the Trent XWB-97, with 97,000lb thrust, is the only new-generation high-thrust engine in service since 2018, enhancing durability and efficiency.

Regarding the flying range, the Airbus A350-1000 boasts the longest range at 7,400 miles, while the A350-900 also excels at 9,522 mi. This difference underscores how the A350 series is optimized for ultra-long-haul travel, whereas the B787-10 is better suited for mid- to long-haul routes.

Prioritizing fuel efficiency in aircraft design

Plane makers are committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. They invest heavily in research and development, collaborate with governments and industry partners, and explore revolutionary technologies to make aviation more sustainable.

These manufacturers incorporate lightweight composite materials, such as the A350, which is made of up to 54% composites. These materials reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency. In addition, advanced digital tools are used to optimize aircraft design and production, ensuring efficiency throughout the lifecycle.

Engine manufacturers play an important role in developing advanced engines like the GE9X for the 777X , which offers 10% lower fuel consumption and is actively compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel SAF. Governments also enhance fuel-efficient practical solutions to help achieve net-zero emissions. These aircraft reflect a blend of cutting-edge engineering and strategic design, highlighting the ongoing evolution of commercial aviation.

""The development of more efficient aircraft and engines. Particularly important are the steps needed to enable aircraft powered by 100% SAF, hydrogen or batteries,"" according to IATA.

The critical role of fuel efficiency in the industry

Aviation is vital for individual and economic prosperity, and strengthening profitability and financial resilience is crucial. With over five billion air travelers, the demand for air travel is strong, and as the global economy relies on air cargo for $8.3 trillion in trade, the aviation industry plays a crucial role in facilitating both passenger and freight movement.

Aviation innovation is advancing with the potential for fuel efficiency improvements. Electric aircraft may contribute to these advancements, with Airbus developing a hydrogen-based aircraft to reduce carbon emissions by up to 100%. Additionally, maintenance can also save fuel by reducing fuel consumption and flexible wing design technology allows wings to adjust shape dynamically, reducing air resistance.

At the same time, airlines seek to boost their profitability, reaching a net profit of about $30.5 billion in 2024. That's why fuel efficiency management is vital for the carrier's continuity. Fuel costs represent about one-third of airlines' operating expenses, and cumulative fuel spending is expected to be $248 billion in 2025. Fuel is expected to account for 26.4% of operating costs in 2025, down from 28.9% in 2024.

The good news is that the industry is experiencing steady technological and operational advancements in fuel efficiency (liter/100 ATK) and fuel consumption (liter/100 km/passenger) developed from 2023 to 2025. With 23.1 fuel efficiency in terms of an airline's transport capacity, fuel efficiency is relatively stable and slightly lower at 4.1 Fuel consumption per passenger per 100 kilometers.

""We’re expecting airlines to deliver a global profit of $36.6 billion in 2025. This will be hard-earned as airlines take advantage of lower oil prices while keeping load factors above 83%, tightly controlling costs, investing in decarbonization,"" said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

This suggests that airlines are optimizing their operations or adopting more efficient aircraft, enhancing the global airline industry's performance. Simultaneously, this will subsidize investments in products and sustainable solutions to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/main-image-16_9-2-19.png,N,,2025-03-29 10:56:13.910878

Santo Domingo.- Alrededor de 150 representantes de 24 países participan en la conferencia “Combustible y sostenibilidad”, que organiza la Asociación Latinoamericana y del Caribe de Transporte Aéreo (ALTA, por sus siglas en inglés), en la que abordan temas cruciales sobre las iniciativas locales y regionales en materia de combustibles sostenibles para la aviación.

Durante cinco días, las misiones nacionales e internacionales que velan por un sistema aéreo libre de contaminación ambiental debatirán interesantes tópicos encaminados a encontrar soluciones que permitan avanzar hacia el futuro de la aviación sostenible.

En ese sentido, el director general del Instituto Dominicano de Aviación Civil (IDAC), Igor Rodríguez Durán en su calidad de anfitrión del encuentro internacional, resaltó la importancia de este tipo de reuniones en los que los Estados discuten y encuentran soluciones a los asuntos que afectan la industria aeronáutica de los países involucrados.

“En la República Dominicana, a través del IDAC, estamos comprometidos con la preservación del medioambiente, el desarrollo sostenible y, por supuesto, la seguridad de la aviación. Nuestro interés es que, durante esta jornada de reuniones, podamos encontrar soluciones que nos permitan avanzar hacia el futuro de la aviación sostenible”, indicó Igor Rodríguez Durán.

El titular del IDAC destacó la importancia de esta conferencia sobre esta reunión, por los avances y la visión global colectiva y ambiciosa que representa, con el objetivo de reducir las emisiones de CO2 en la aviación internacional mediante el uso de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, por sus siglas en inglés) y otros combustibles sostenibles y energías limpias, cuya meta es reducir las emisiones en un 5% para 2030, un compromiso clave para el futuro de la aviación.

Asimismo, José Ricardo Botelho, quien preside la conferencia en representación de Peter Cerdá, CEO y presidente de ALTA, aportó datos interesantes, como que entre 2011 y 2023, el consumo de combustible de las aerolíneas de América Latina y el Caribe, por cada 100 RPK (Pasajeros-Kilómetros Recorridos) disminuyó un 28% gracias a la renovación de flotas, mejoras operativas y la adopción de nuevas tecnologías.

Botelho añadió que las aerolíneas miembros de ALTA han reducido la edad promedio de sus flotas en un 18%, lo que les ha permitido aprovechar los beneficios de los aviones de última generación, que consumen entre un 15% y un 20% menos de combustible.

“América Latina y el Caribe es una de las regiones que menos contribuye a las emisiones globales de CO2 en la aviación. En 2023, las emisiones globales de la industria alcanzaron aproximadamente 867 millones de toneladas, de las cuales solo el 2.6% correspondieron a Brasil y México, los dos únicos países de la región entre los 25 con mayores emisiones de CO2 derivadas de la aviación”, puntualizó.

En sesión de apertura de la conferencia “Combustible y sostenibilidad”, que organiza la Asociación Latinoamericana y del Caribe de Transporte Aéreo (ALTA, por sus siglas en inglés) participaron, además de Botelho y Rodríguez Durán, Paola Aimée Plá Puello, subdirectora General del IDAC; Miguel Mejía, subdirector-Director de Desarrollo Sustentable del IDAC; Noel Báez, viceministro de Hidrocarburos, en representación de Joel Santos, ministro de Energía y Minas Joel Santos.

Relevance of the Topic: Prelims: Key facts about Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF); Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF)

ATF is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircrafts and jet engines.

Constituents: Jet fuel is a mixture of a variety of hydrocarbons. The most common ATF is Kerosene-type jet fuel.

Concerns:

Price-sensitive: The price of ATF is a major component of the operating cost of airlines, and the tax on ATF significantly contributes to the ATF price. The Ministry of Civil Aviation has long advocated for bringing ATF under GST (Goods and Services Tax) to eliminate tax disadvantages faced by domestic airlines compared to foreign carriers.

Environmental pollution: ATF combustion in aircraft engines releases various pollutants like Nitrogen oxides, Carbon monoxide, Particulate matter etc. leading to ozone layer depletion and global warming.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

SAF is a biofuel alternative to conventional jet fuel with a smaller carbon footprint.

It can be blended with conventional jet fuel (with blending limits ranging 1%-50%).

Sources of SAF:

Oil seeds, other fats, oils, and greases

Residues- agricultural, forestry residues, wood mill waste

Wastes- municipal solid waste, sludge and wet waste

Produced synthetically by capturing carbon directly from the air.

Advantages:

Engine compatibility: can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure.

Fewer emissions: 100% (pure) SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% depending on feedstock and technology pathway.

Sustainable: SAF feedstock does not compete with food crops, neither causes forest degradation.

Challenge:

Expensive: SAF is about four times more expensive than petroleum jet fuel.

SAF indicative blending Target:

In 2022, members of the International Civil Aviation Organisation had agreed to a long-term aspirational goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from aviation by 2050, and SAF has long been seen as the industry's fastest way to reduce emissions.

In 2023, Indian government has set the following initial indicative blending percentages of SAF in ATF:

1% SAF indicative blending target in 2027 (Initially for International flights).

2% SAF blending target in 2028 (Initially for International flights )

5% by 2030.

The success of SAF will require using a greater diversity of feedstock and production methods. This includes areas such as investing in carbon offset programmes and the diversification of SAF feedstocks.",https://i0.wp.com/compass.rauias.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-109.png,N,,2025-03-29 11:56:18.680535

A portfolio of that size is expected to keep Shell ahead of TotalEnergies, despite the French major’s own ambition to grow its LNG business by more than 50% by the end of this decade.
Shell has opted not to match the oil ambitions of its supermajor rivals, which all guide for growth this decade.
""The one big asset that Shell has that doesn’t get enough credit [or] awareness is the formidable trading business,"" says Panmure Liberum analyst Ashley Kelty.
“We do not believe we are the natural owners of this chemicals portfolio,” given lack of scale in some areas and competing opportunities across the company for capital, Sawan said.","Shell cemented its two-year strategic turnaround at this week’s Capital Markets Day (CMD) in New York, largely sidelining its low-carbon spending and embracing an industry-leading LNG portfolio as its new, streamlined transition strategy. The decision — made in the name of returns — promises bumper cash flows that can support years of increased buybacks, crystallizing the sector’s wider embrace of near-term shareholder returns over long-term strategic change. Here are four key takeaways from Shell’s latest strategy update.

• Shell insists LNG will be a strategic ""winner,"" no matter how the world transitions.

Shell is hardly alone in its bullish views on LNG, but its singular bet on the fuel to drive its production growth this decade stands out from its peers. At the Mar. 25 CMD, Sawan underlined that making and trading more LNG will be Shell's biggest contribution to the energy transition over the next decade, tipping the fuel to be a ""winner"" no matter which of Shell's future energy scenarios turns out to be most accurate. The company’s recent baseline industry outlook forecasts a roughly 60% increase in global LNG demand by 2040, fuelled by Asian economic growth and rising electricity consumption for artificial intelligence.

Integrated Gas — the first of three ""great franchise businesses"" Sawan chose to highlight — will consequently claim a 27%-30% share of capex over 2025-28. Already the leading Western LNG player, Shell had 29 million tons of liquefaction volumes to its name last year, and capacity is set to increase by almost one-third in the next few years, Sawan said. Upcoming projects include Nigeria, Qatar, Abu Dhabi and the first 14 million ton per year phase of LNG Canada, which will start up later this year.

Wider LNG sales from both equity and offtake positions will meanwhile grow at 4%-5% per year, giving it some 83 million-88 million tons in 2030. A portfolio of that size is expected to keep Shell ahead of TotalEnergies, despite the French major’s own ambition to grow its LNG business by more than 50% by the end of this decade. Later, Shell will have options such as Oman Train 4, a second phase at LNG Canada and backfill opportunities to consider should it want to chase further growth beyond 2030. Most of Shell’s sales are set to be indexed to Brent crude.

Shell will not join its peers in plotting oil growth, but insists its stable production base will remain profitable and long-lived.

Shell has opted not to match the oil ambitions of its supermajor rivals, which all guide for growth this decade. Instead, Shell is sticking with previous plans to maintain 1.4 million barrels per day of liquids output, with CFO Sinead Gorman noting that the company will still need to invest to sustain that level due to natural decline rates. Nonetheless, she insisted that there is ""no cap"" on Shell’s liquids output and noted that the guidance represented ""a view out to 2030 which is not priced in at the moment."" Shell’s guidance is premised on a $70 Brent real 2024 oil price.

To maintain this liquids base, Shell is banking on maximizing output from deepwater fields such as Sparta in the US Gulf of Mexico and the recently FID’d Gato de Mato offshore Brazil. Such projects will add more than 1 million boe/d of new capacity between now and 2030, with an estimated breakeven of $35 per barrel. The major is ""very much focused in terms of the high-margin barrels that will come through,"" Gorman said.

Overall production levels could be sustained until 2035, Sawan said, claiming the list of projects in the pipeline would allow Shell to ""build a runway through to the 2040s,"" without a lot of inorganic spending.

• Shell wants to use its trading prowess to help turn struggling businesses around.

Shell's opaque, but significant, trading business has long made material contributions to earnings in oil, gas, LNG and marketing, delivering an average 2% uplift to returns on average capital employed (ROACE) over the past decade, the company claims. With the head of trading now sitting on Shell's executive committee, the company wants to leverage its trading savvy in its power and transition businesses to help make them profitable.

""The one big asset that Shell has that doesn’t get enough credit [or] awareness is the formidable trading business,"" says Panmure Liberum analyst Ashley Kelty. ""It's up there, if not better than the likes of Vitol and Glencore — [and] makes a big impact on profits.""

Shell has identified $45 billion of capital employed that is not performing as desired, and $20 billion sits within its power and low-carbon businesses. The company wants to raise its power ROACE from 3% in 2024 to 10% by 2030, moving away from assets with infrastructure-facing returns toward assets that support trading strategies, such as gas-fired power, large-scale batteries and digital technologies. The major's recent acquisition of a 609 megawatt combined-cycle gas turbine power plant in Rhode Island is an example of this strategy in action.

Through a business model ""best described as trading-led, asset-backed,” Sawan wants to raise the share of flexible trading assets in power from 50% to 80% by 2030. Shell also plans to divest nonstrategic transition assets such as its offshore wind positions in South Korea and the Philippines, echoing BP in pursuing a “capital-light” approach to renewables.

Shell also sees big potential for trading in low-carbon fuels. The major sold 10 times more biofuels than the amount it produced last year, becoming one of the biggest traders in sustainable aviation fuel. “We want to build a profitable low-carbon fuels business for the future and we will do this by leveraging our trading and optimization capabilities to grow sales and secure sustainable feedstocks,” said Sawan, remaining bullish on the long-term outlook for biofuels, despite current headwinds.

When he took the helm, Sawan pledged to devote 15%-20% of investment toward low-carbon businesses but now wants a maximum of 10% of Shell's capital employed in those areas by the end of the decade. The outlook for carbon capture and hydrogen within Shell is particularly bleak, although they could help support its gas business.

Sawan’s returns emphasis will see a further downstream rationalization and partnerships in chemicals.

Shell, once a huge oil refiner, will now focus its refining at four big facilities: two in Europe and two in North America. ""By harvesting noncore refineries for cash, repurposing them or disposing of them, we can focus on a smaller number of high-performing facilities that generate stronger financial returns,"" Gorman explained.

Sawan confirmed Shell could sell its struggling US and European chemical assets through ""strategic and partnership opportunities” in the US and “high-grading” in Europe, where selective closures could be made. “We do not believe we are the natural owners of this chemicals portfolio,” given lack of scale in some areas and competing opportunities across the company for capital, Sawan said.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e741bb9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/900x473+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F2f%2F80%2Fed835bb342e2bfed0869bf1b7146%2Fss1801829758-logo-shell-v2.jpg,N,,2025-03-29 10:56:22.474362

Thanks, Eric. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our call. We have filed our Form 10K today and we ask that you refer to it for more detailed information after this call.

We're here to talk about our results from the fourth quarter and for the full year 2024 and to discuss the business update that we released on March 7. There's lots to talk about. We want to leave some time for questions, so let's get at it.

2024 was a big year for Gevo. It set us on a path we believe for substantial growth this year targeting positive adjusted EBITDA. We explained this in our business update and our press release earlier today, and you'll also see these ideas laid out visually in our investor presentation on our website. Please go take a look. It's pretty darn interesting.

First up, Gevo North Dakota. This acquisition in Richardton, North Dakota is a game changer for us, and it's already contributing. The site is one of the two low-carbon ethanol plants with operational carbon capture and sequestration or CCS that are operating today. It captures over 160,000 tons of biogenic carbon dioxide a year and has one of the lowest carbon intensity scores in the industry.

The CI score at Gevo North Dakota is an estimated 21 grams of CO2 equivalents per megajoule under the Argonne GREET 45Z model. That's not including any benefits for regenerative agricultural practices. That's a big deal because it means we can start monetizing carbon abatement and the 45Z tax credit immediately. We're already working on it.

This asset alone has the potential to generate $30 million to $60 million of adjusted EBITDA annually, depending upon the price of ethanol, depending upon the full values of the 45Zs and all the rest and RINs. So it's very interesting opportunity for us.

On RNG we saw a strong production growth in 2024. We're on track to produce over 400,000 million BTUs in 2025. And with the Biogas 45Z tax credit, that business is shaping up to be a solid contributor as well. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the $9 million to $18 million range in the year 2025 from this project due to operational improvements securing the provisional California Air Resources Board or CARB, net carbon intensity score, and the monetization of Biogas 45Z tax credits.

We're excited that CARB has published our comment for low carbon fuel standard pathway application, and it has a weighted CI score of around minus 339. So that's right in line with what our expectations were. I'm feeling pretty good about that, and actually, we should get that any day now.

Our South Dakota project, which we're now calling Alcohol-to-Jet 60 or ATJ-60, that means, we're talking about Alcohol-to-Jet 60 million gallons, is progressing. Last year, we received a conditional commitment for a loan guarantee with disbursements totaling $1.46 billion excluding the capitalized interest during construction from the US Department of Energy, DOE, loan program office for our ATJ-60 project.

With capitalized interest during construction, the DOE loan facility has a borrowing capacity of $1.63 billion. We're pleased with the continued collaboration with the DOE loan office as we move forward to achieve financial goals for the project.

Now, lots of questions about what happens, were there any changes during the transition for the President and his new administration? Well, like I say, we haven't seen much of a slowdown. I know I see all these press reports, but they're not correct. They didn't -- we didn't see slowdown. They're plugging away; we are plugging away to do on our end as well.

Now, one good piece of news that I can point to that isn't -- that I think is worthwhile is that at CERAWeek in Houston a couple of weeks ago, Secretary Wright said in his presentation that the DOE loan office, the LPO, would be honoring the commitments made by them. That's good because I think that was his first wide public statement of that.

We are watching the Summit pipeline issue with interest. I would like to see what Summit does next regarding the pipeline before we finalize the economics for our project. While we do have our own sequestration site with our -- up at North Dakota at our Richardton plant, we can capture the CCS, bring it there, and put it downhole and capture value from it.

We could do that, and if we went this route, the project returns for South Dakota plant would still be attractive. However, doing that transfer without a pipeline hurts by a couple of IRR points.

Now Summit tells us that they still believe strongly that the pipeline is going to get done, and I do know this that CCS and CO2 are part of the energy infrastructure. CO2 absolutely is going to be needed in North Dakota for enhanced oil recovery in the Bakken. Getting more oil out of the Bakken strikes me as a priority.

Now it takes years to build that infrastructure. So we'll see what happens here is they're going to get incorporated part of the overall energy infrastructure. I'm interested to see how this all unfolds.

We also need to pin down some tweaks to off-take agreements with airlines to make them more compatible with project financing requirements put up by -- or put on us by the DOE loan office. We want to underpin carbon value outside of the regulatory value. We're making progress on this front. We'll announce details after it's done.

Now, recall that the jet fuel is -- that we'll produce is valued as a commodity like fossil jet. It's just jet fuel. It has to be that way for it to be a drop in. Now, there certainly is a regulatory value like RINs or the state level, and we expect 45Z, okay? All good. That adds value.

In addition to that, it's this voluntary carbon value that is worthwhile. We want to make sure that we're getting paid properly for the carbon value. So we're reworking some of the contracts, some of the deals, some of the approaches to make sure that we aren't giving money away. We're working at it.

In addition to Gevo's paid-in capital as we developed this project, we're going to need to raise roughly about $800 million of equity into a special purpose vehicle whose mission is to build that plant and operate that plant. This SPV would be a project-level company that would not -- and it would not be diluted to Gevo. It's not raising money at a Gevo level. It's at a special purpose vehicle level, project level, classic project financing for the DOE loan.

We are targeting financial closes for our project level capital raise by 2025 year-end. That includes the DOE loan, our project level equity capital raising, and then the start of construction of the facility. In order for us to get to financial close, we expect that we will need to spend maybe $40 million-more of development money inclusive of the whole year of 2025 actually to get all the way to FID, so even if it's stretched further.

Once we get the financial close, we'll be off to the races building this plant in South Dakota. It'll be heavily modularized, and it wouldn't require any further capital from Gevo. That's a pretty big deal to bake into your memory.

We're also doing the engineering work for our ATJ plant at our North Dakota site. This one's on the fast track because we can leverage the work that was done for our ATJ-60. North Dakota is an extremely friendly business state. We have great ethanol plant there. We've already got CCS, and there seems to be a lot of interest in this plant.

So we're going to try to move it along very fast, leveraging what we have already done. So more come on this as we progress. We also have two other plants in concept development based on what we're doing in North Dakota.

So what's interesting is I think we're getting this modularization model pinned down, here's how we can replicate things. Copy-paste is how Paul Bloom likes to refer to it, sometimes copy, edit, paste. But we're getting interest from around the world on this. So let's see what comes through in the future. We won't lose focus on getting the plant, get ourselves to EBITDA positive, but then also getting the CTG plant in North Dakota, getting the one South Dakota deployed.

Now stepping back for a second, the reason that we have interest in our plants and technologies is that we can produce this drop in jet fuel, and that on a production cost basis can be competitive with fossil-based jet fuel. That is a big deal in terms of concept.

It's not that it's one or the other of reducing the carbon footprint. You can actually make jet fuel for renewable resources like cornstarch that are competitive on a production cost basis with fossil-based jet fuel. That's a big concept. It's the capital that is the issue.

If our plant was paid off, then we just compete head-to-head, no substitute tax credits required. But we do have capital to pay back. Now, to pay back the capital and generate reinvestment returns, the tax credits for SAF, the RINs, they're certainly useful.

We are bringing this new attribute to markets. We're spending a lot of work on effort to make sure that we're -- how do we capture value from carbon abatement? That's separate than tax credit and RINs. There are people -- there's a market that people will pay for the carbon to be reduced.

A project like our ATJ-60 could abate 500,000 to 600,000 tons of carbon annually. I wonder how many dollars per ton can we get for that? And I wonder if there'll be different fractions that we might be able to market to add value.

Bottom line is, it's not that -- this project isn't about carbon reduction at any cost. It's about making a cost competitive jet fuel and cash rebounded from the new attribute we bring, which is the carbon abatement. It's carbon reduction done cost effectively.

So we're having to sort this out. It takes work, and I got to tell you that when you add it all up, you add up the tax credits, you add up the RINs, you add up the voluntary market, you add up the fact that it's dropping jet fuel, it makes for an exciting project.

That's why we're getting such broad support across the board, and I think it's that -- I think that there aren't that many approaches that can do this. We happen to have one of them. ATJ is going to be part of the product mix in the future.

We see -- now turning my attention to a little bit to 45Z, it's a common question we get asked. I got to say we see a lot of bipartisan support for 45Z extension. 45Z is set up so that it is truly a pay for performance. Right now, I'm only aware of two plants in the country that could qualify for a 45Z tax credit as of today. Both of them are in North Dakota, one is ours.

So that's good. And I think as CCS becomes more widely available, there might be some other plants, et cetera, that can be done, but it's not a government giveaway at all. You got to do something for it that's creative and helps set up infrastructure.

When it comes to jet fuel, jet fuel is now referred to by the new administration as synthetic aviation fuel rather than sustainable aviation fuel. I think that's actually closer to the name it was originally called synthetic kerosene. That actually is what it's called in the ASTM certifications.

So great, it's on their list. Awesome. And so I think 45Z is relevant for that and it's exciting because 45Z SAF allows a new market for ethanol. That's a big deal for when you're trying to develop our economy.

So when we do an ATJ plant, it's about energy security, real economic development, impact on commodity prices and jobs, all of that stuff together. Now, we did a study done by Charles River Associates looking at ATJ-60 plant in South Dakota, and it would be expected to create for 100 direct jobs, 700 indirect jobs right in the region. You have more than 1,000 highly paid construction jobs during the build out period of three years.

It'd be expected to generate when it's operating $100 million-plus per year of regional economic development right there in South Dakota for as long as the plant exists and operates. That's a huge economic impact. It lifts the prices of the commodities. It's like -- it makes cost competitive, production cost competitive fuels.

And the ATJ-60 plan to draw corn from roughly 230 farmers would help them. They'd expect to see the price rise in their corn because we're buying it locally and we have a business system that we expect will be able to capture value from the agricultural practices. We'll be able to differentiate it. This is what Verity is all about, tracking and tracing and taking it forth to the marketplace as attributes so we can find those people who value it.

And the other thing that Charles Rivers associates did is that they estimated that for every $1 tax credit in 45Z to return to the Treasury could be expected to be up to $6. For every $1 tax credit, $6 back to the Treasury. So even if you're a big skeptic and say, that's all those things that they take into account and all those soft things, even the hard things, you're still going to get a couple $3 back to Treasury per $1 of tax credit.

This matters. This is what economic development is all about, using government money wisely. But you've got -- it's pay-for-performance. You got to deliver something, jobs, energy security, cost-competitive products, address a new market.

So it's all about adding jobs, adding value for farmers, economic development, delivering the drop-ins, competitive with fossil-based jet fuel, and that abates carbon. Yes, cost competitive and carbon abatement are possible at the same time. I'm excited for the future and what's possible.

Now, imagine cookie cutter versions of our ATJ plants. This is actually the approach that we're taking. It's what we want to do. It's why we're pursuing the modularization approach. There's roughly 180 ethanol plants currently operating in the US. Imagine the impact by converting a chunk of these into ATJ plants. Think of the jobs created. Think of the ethanol -- think about how the ethanol market is in current overcapacity.

We could sop up that overcapacity, turn it into jet fuel, and lift ethanol prices and lift corn prices. It'd be a good deal, actually, and I think everybody would benefit. And of course, all this while we're adding to energy security, producing more jet fuel. And of course, whenever we say jet fuel, we could also produce diesel fuel too. These plants can do either one.

And these can be cost competitive with the fossil-based fuels. And don't forget, these business systems would produce about 3 tons of protein and feed products for the food chain for every ton of jet fuel produced. So it's not food versus fuel or anything like that. It's about doing both wisely and economically and making the overall business system better, the economy better.

And there's also no more need to draw in more land for agriculture. In fact, we're finding that the farmers are doing great. They can increase productivity. There's a lot of room to grow on the land that they already have. So all this talk that we occasionally hear about, oh, it's going to take so much more land. No, that's wrong. Let's go. We got data. It's an exciting time for us.

I really, really like President Trump's Executive Order called declaring a national emergency. Did you all catch that biofuels are listed right there with oil, that ethanol and aviation fuel are listed right there with refined products as priorities? That's very cool, very good for us.

I also like the Executive Order called Unleashing American Energy. This one talked about clearing the roadblocks for infrastructure deployment. It also called for removable political bias and assessments and models. That's huge because that's how there'd been a problem in the past with how environment groups do.

They say, hey, here's this really cool thing we can do. This is the government. We do a really cool thing; we're going to make this new thing. Oh, and then also there's 50,000 rules that make it impossible to take any action. Good, let's get rid of that stuff. A lot of those rules are put in there by environment groups. They're the ones who raised these issues with no data. Great, let's get rid of it. Look at the data and the facts. I'm all about that.

The other thing that I'm interested in is that -- this new administration is interested in leveling the playing field at the EU level. Good, you penalized agricultural products in the United States. They do that. They do it in their modeling and their scoring of carbon and all the rest. Good, that's been an issue. I want to see it get addressed. Let's go.

So all in all, I'm very optimistic, so I want to see what these guys can deliver. If they do what they say, it can be very good for all of us.

Now, before I turn over to Lynn, I want to give you some context as to what we're doing with Axens. No doubt you saw a press release about that and wondered. It comes down to this. We announced that we're broadening the relationship with Axens.

They've been a good partner. We started working with Axens a number of years ago because they have proven technology unit operations that can convert ethanol into jet fuel. There's several steps involved. They did them in the petrochemical industry. So by working together, we can put the whole process together.

The thing about them is that these technologies, these unit operations have been operating, for instance, ethylene to make butanes, then butanes to make the thing that's just real close to jet fuel. They've been operating for decades on a commercial basis in the petrochemical industry. They didn't make it from ethanol; they got their ethylene from a different source.

So that's why we could clear the technical diligence for the DOE launch, showing and proving to their independent engineers -- the DOE's independent engineers -- who are being paid to prove things to say no. We could prove to them that these technologies work.

That's why we're able to achieve this. Axens is the only company with each of the critical unit operations commercialized, albeit with fossil fuels, except for they have a project in that does ethanol de-aggregation and ethylene in Japan.

Having technologies for unit operations is only one piece of the puzzle, however, and that's where Gevo comes in. We know how to put it all together with renewable energy and how to integrate ethanol plants that drive both cost and CI down. The overall plant designs we own. Those are our property, our intellectual property.

We have the patents on how to achieve the very low CI footprint. We file those patents. We also know how to track and trace carbon as well as a deep understanding of the developing market, because the company that needs the jet fuel isn't necessarily the one who needs the carbon. It might be somebody else in the value chain.

We also have roughly over 100 patents covering the whole business system of ethanol to jet from end to end. They have technology, we have technology, we have quite a lot of it. So it makes sense to partner, to offer a more complete business offering to potential customers who want to build plants. And remember, we see ourselves as developing plants or even selling plants.

We're already down the road on this. We'll be a developer and a license to leverage what we learned in our South Dakota project. We believe that the market for alcohol to hydrocarbons will continue to increase fundamentally economically sound.

We've also licensed our ETO technology to Axens. So they've become a licenser from us, taking a license from us. I find this very significant. The reason is this. The Axens technology embodied in the first-generation processes, the ones we are planning to use for our HTJ-60 plant and for our North Dakota ATJ plant, they won a Nobel Prize for the critical step of converting ethylene to mixed butane.

This is a long time ago. This was like 40 years ago. They want it. That was a great breakthrough. That's why they're the only ones who -- they've led the way in that technology in the petrochemical industry. We see a lot of startups try to do this tech, and they're going to -- they fail, or they will fail or they're going to fail. It's a very difficult step.

That's why we finally got Axens to work with us after trying for 10 years. Axens has proven it out, it works. There's no question about it.

Now I take great pride then that these people with the Nobel Prize in their background think that our ETO technology is a breakthrough on this converting of ethylene -- ethanol to ethylene into the jet system, and that it simplifies steps, and it's expected to lower CapEx and OpEx by a ballpark of about 30%, beating their technology.

That makes me feel like maybe we're on to something here. So together, we're going to go finish it out. Scale it up, probably take about 18 more months, depending upon what we learn as we go or kind of roadblocks we run into. You got to go through and scale up this kind of these kind of technologies.

So for all of these reasons together, technology and business system that make for a great partnership. All right then, Lynn it's over to you.

L. Lynn Smull

Thanks, Pat. Let's go over some key numbers. We ended Q4 2024 with $259 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Combined operating revenue and other net income was $8.9 million for the fourth quarter, and $32.7 million for the full year.

Our RNG subsidiary generated $15.8 million in revenue during the year. We're working towards securing a final LCFS carbon intensity score from CARB, which we expect in the first quarter of 2025. As Pat said, that's any day now. That will unlock more value and better margins for the RNG project.

Company-wide, loss from operations was $19.6 million last quarter with a non-GAAP adjusted EBEA loss of $11.3 million. Given that the acquisition of Gevo North Dakota has closed and the ethanol 45Z and Biogas 45Z tax credits expected this year, and other factors, as Pat mentioned, we see a clear path to a positive run rate adjusted EBITDA in 2025. That's a major shift in our financial trajectory, and the updated investor presentation on our website provides more information on that topic.

We continue to be disciplined with our capital. We project 40 million of spend on the ATJ-60 project development from January 1 this year until we reach financial close. We expect total development cost at financial close to be well under previously announced high ends of potential ATJ-60 development spend.

At the start of last year, we said we planned to achieve first revenue at Verity, our software-as-a-service business for tracking and tracing of regenerative agricultural products. We achieved that in 2024, and we expect to grow the customer base in 2025. It's too early to provide specific guidance, but we have a unique software platform that provides much needed accuracy, transparency, and quality that is poised to grow into a very large total addressable market.

With that, I'll pass it over to Chris.

Chris Ryan

Thanks, Lynn. You'll find a summary of our Gevo North Dakota acquisition in our press release, and Pat also made some comments. So I'll just provide a brief update on that. Our operations team at the plant are doing a great job keeping the processes running smoothly.

They're producing about 67 million gallons a year of low carbon ethanol, which includes 2 million gallons of ultra-low carbon intensity corn fiber ethanol. We're capturing carbon and sequestering it on site, which gives us an important competitive advantage in the ethanol industry, while we generate valuable carbon dioxide removal credits, otherwise known as CDRs.

To put some carbon score numbers on this, our British Columbia carbon intensity is about 19 grams of CO2 per megajoule, and our CI score calculated according to the Argonne R&D GREET model, is about 21 grams CO2 per megajoule before we take into account the regenerative ag practices from the corn farmers that are supplying us. For those who are familiar, that's nearly the lowest carbon intensity in the ethanol industry.

As a result, as Pat mentioned, this acquisition immediately strengthened our ability to generate and monetize carbon reduction even without any major capital investments. In the longer term, we believe it's a great site to look at potentially converting that low carbon ethanol into synthetic aviation fuel or SAF.

In March, a group from Gevo management spent the afternoon with many of the farmers that supply our plant in Richardton. We talked with these farmers about our vision for growth at the site, including the potential for an ATJ plant, which represents a whole new use for American agricultural products.

We listened to the farmers talk about the regenerative ag practices that they're already using there. And we talked about ways those practices may translate into more value for them. These farmer relationships are critical for the success of our plant, and we all walked away feeling our interests were aligned with them.

We're excited about what this means for Gevo's future. With that, I'll turn it over to Paul.

Paul Bloom

Thanks, Chris. I'll be brief as well. Regarding Verity, we're growing fast. We're currently generating revenue and growing our customer base. We doubled our growers' program acreage since the second quarter of 2024 and tracked over 200,000 acres in 2024.

We signed agreements with five ethanol producers and two soy crush plants and have more on the way. Verity aims to help the industry measure and verify sustainable attributes from the fields to final products made from corn, soybeans, and other agricultural feedstocks for food, feed, fuels, and industrial products. The growing unmet demand for traceability in agriculture and energy is real, and Verity is proving to be a valuable tool.

Regarding our patented ethanol-to-olefins or ETO technology, as Pat mentioned, we expanded our strategic alliance with Axens to develop, commercialize, and license this technology globally for fuels. We also aligned our technology, business system, and know-how with Axens to drive alcohol to jet commercialization under a new alliance agreement.

We aren't just building our own ATJ projects. We have a robust IT portfolio to license technology and engineered solutions to the whole industry. In addition, we continue to make good progress with our ethanol-to-olefins joint development agreement with LG Chem to make bio-based chemicals, including propylene, which is a key building block in the petrochemical industry today.

The market opportunity here is large and could create more demand for US agricultural products. We're talking about technologies that can take corn and ethanol and convert into low carbon drop-in fuels and materials that match petroleum to help make all kinds of products from diapers to durable parts for our cars to jet fuel.

We're using our technology and business system to bring agriculture and energy together to drive growth for rural America. Back to you, Pat.

Patrick Gruber

Thanks, Paul. And with that, let's open it up for questions.

Question and Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Amit Dayal, H.C. Wainwright.

Amit Dayal

Thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So Pat, with respect to the SPV side of the net 01 opportunity, what are the equity investor options in front of you? Are these potentially like, strategic folks already in that value chain? Or are these typical, financial investors like who are you speaking to right now? Any color on what those options in front of you are?

Patrick Gruber

Yeah, it's the normal set of characters across all, ranging from strategics to specialty funds to those classic financial funds. It's a whole spectrum of them. And just got to go work through it and see who's going to -- what's real. And we'll make it happen.

Amit Dayal

Okay. And does some of this need to be arranged to close the DOE loan, or can that come later when you start tapping into or drawing down on that loan?

Patrick Gruber

No, this would be a prerequisite to have the commitments. It's a prerequisite to have the commitments to get the FID. It would all come together at once.

Amit Dayal

So then in that context, what is the timeline to complete sort of this side of the process?

Patrick Gruber

I think the best that -- we're not supposed to talk about the details of the DOE loan process still. But I think it's -- to say that we get it done in 2025, that's what we're targeting, and it's in that timeframe that we would come together.

We've already been engaged obviously in Wall Street and talking to funds, so we already have a sense of interest, and we have a sense that things economics can work. I think at this point that we made about pinning down some of the carbon values that market is growing in in the voluntary carbon market, Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions.

It's pretty interesting, and so we are tweaking some of our contracts because it makes a better project, and so we're doing that. So we're going to want to get that done, but it's just the practical reality is this going to be later in the year to get it all done.

Amit Dayal

Okay, understood. Then with respect to the carbon capture expansion opportunity at North Dakota, going forward as you, increase capacity over there, what are the options sort of to monetize that? Will you be sort of participating in the carbon trading markets? Or is there sort of a different, monetization strategy that is maybe easier and more -- or provides a better visibility for you guys?

Patrick Gruber

Paul, I'm going to let you answer that. This is your realm as the Chief Business Officer, and you're busy on carbon.

Paul Bloom

Yeah, sure, no problem. So we've got a couple of options here on how to monetize. Obviously, we can put that value from the CCS into an approved pathway with the renewable fuel. So think about just including that all bundled together. But then separately if we don't do that, we can take that CCS value into a market called CDRs, and Chris mentioned this, which are carbon dioxide removal credits.

And these are permanent carbon dioxide removals, right? They're going to be there for 100,000 of years, as we store that CO2 that used to be in the atmosphere. And that's a market that's developing today. And so we're actively participating there and working on, how do we market carbon either with the fuel or separately from the fuel into those markets. So more to come on that.

Amit Dayal

Understood, thank you. Just last one for me. The expansion on the RNG front, I know you were looking to increase volumes, et cetera. Is that already done or are you still in the process of executing on that?

Patrick Gruber

Well, we've already expanded it so it's the capacity 40,000 million BTUs. We're pushing up further how far we go beyond that. We put in some additional equipment and such, so we have to go do that work.

Amit Dayal

Okay. All right. So that's all I have for now. I will take my other questions offline. Thank you.

Operator

Nate Pendleton, Texas Capital.

Nate Pendleton

Good afternoon. Specifically looking at your first plant, can you share your perspective on how recent tariff announcements are impacting potential costs there as you approach financial close?

Patrick Gruber

Do you mean for the ATJ-60 in South Dakota?

Nate Pendleton

That's correct.

Patrick Gruber

Yeah. Hey, Chris, you want to comment on it? That's your bailiwick.

Chris Ryan

Those are not impacting -- if that was the question, really not impacting our project at all. We've got -- when you look at, say, project cost, for example, most of the project really wouldn't be subject to that.

Nate Pendleton

Okay, understood. Thank you. And then shifting over to the ethanol-to-olefins technology that you touched on in the prepared remarks, can you lay out future milestones that the market should be watching as that business scales?

Patrick Gruber

Paul, you want to take that one?

Paul Bloom

Yeah, sure. As Pat mentioned in his remarks, right now we've got the development -- we're in the development phase of that with Axens, so active project. We've been through a first pilot stage, so that was our real first milestone that we made after getting to our lab phase.

And now we're really in this stage, can we get this done in 12 months? Can we get it done in 18 months? It's all about de-risking that technology. So we're very comfortable with moving to scale. So that's kind of the timeframe that we're looking at to have our next milestone, which is really getting this ready for commercialization.

Patrick Gruber

And I'll add that is typical. This chemistry converting these what are called olefins into these fuel products, when you think about it at a really large scale, things that are PPM, parts per million, matter, because you're doing millions and millions of pounds.

And so what builds up? What happens? Do you really understand it in detail? This is the mistake that is classically made over and over and over. People will take something from the lab and just rush it in the scale up in these catalytic systems. These are catalytic systems, not fermentation systems, catalytic systems.

And they get burned by it, and stuff doesn't work, plugs the columns or the catalysts just don't work the way they thought. This is the beauty of what Axens has done in the past and why it's fun to work with them because they've seen lots of these things.

Between us, we've been working on these catalytic technologies since 2007. I think people have forgotten that we were the first to do ethanol to jet fuel back and even in 2007, 2008 timeframe, we did it.

It was just a very practical case of -- at that point, Axens didn't want to license their technology to us because they didn't believe you could get to a low carbon, a zero-carbon footprint. Well, we were pursuing isobutanol, which is a way of skipping the steps, and then we had ETO.

When everyone got focused on the jet fuel, on SAF and jet fuel, then Axens had been working with us on the isobutanol to jet and gasoline because we thought gasoline was going to be the big driver. Well, the market centered on SAF. Well then, together, we said they learned with us that, my gosh, you really can get to zero and below footprint on a CI score. So they licensed it to us. Good, I wish they had done it sooner or even further ahead on the ethanol front.

So the ETO thing is a breakthrough. It looks really good. It is this classic case of we don't know fully what we don't know and we're going to go look for things that go wrong and scale it up. And that's the approach you take on these kinds of scale-ups, try to figure out what breaks the system. That's what we have to go do. And when we learn something, then we'll adjust the conditions. So I hate to say that here's a hard and fast milestone of we're going to go through the scale ups.

By the way, this is the same technology that we're already working on scale up with LG Chem. So the LG Chem for propylene is a variant of the technologies. So we already have pretty good confidence that it works at reasonable size scale, but we need ginormous scale for fuels. Chemical products only need kind of medium sized scale; fuels, ginormous scale.

Nate Pendleton

Got it. I appreciate that detail. And then, just one last one for me if I may. Regarding your Luverne facility, do you provide any thoughts around how you may leverage that asset in the future?

Patrick Gruber

Yeah. I think it's a -- for us, running it as an ethanol plant doesn't make sense. Yeah, we have some ideas here, so you'll have to stay tuned. But it's a -- we got some really good ideas that are in play. We just can't talk about things yet.

Nate Pendleton

All right. Well, thanks for taking my questions.

Patrick Gruber

You bet.

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Ethan Fingerer, Opp Co.

Ethan Fingerer

Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Can you talk about what's been holding up the DOE process and what the timeline is? What have been the obstacles, and what have you accomplished, and what's still left to be done, please? That's question one.

And then the second question is you mentioned needing to raise $800 million in equity. One of the other questioners asked who the targets is in terms of the potential investors. I'm interested to know who's banking that for you. Who's helping you bank that? Which investment banks are you working with? Have you engaged anybody on that, and where does that stand, please?

(technical difficulty) Can you guys hear me?

Patrick Gruber

Hey, Ethan. So it's the same things we've been same things we've talked about in the past is that we have to go through and do some of the environmental stuff that's required for the DOE loan program that has to be done. That was slowed down probably by the transition. They just weren't people there to sign off on things.

That has to happen. We're tweaking some of these contracts. The uncertainty around the pipeline isn't helpful in that we just got to know which way it's going, which way it's blowing. We're still going to plan on that, the economics for the whole project work.

But none of us really want to take a hit of a couple percentage points on the IRRs. So that matters, especially for equity. So going slower on this, a month or two, I want to see what happens. What is Summit going to do next? I really would like to know that because it's a question that always comes up, and we always have to answer it.

This other thing that is interesting that I mentioned is the carbon markets by -- we have already talked that we're tweaking contracts. We've said this many earnings calls that we're tweaking contracts. Part of this is that if you just rush in and do a kind of a project finance contract the old way, just whatever, you're giving away a huge amount of value. I think it's really stupid.

So we're tweaking stuff to make sure the project economics work in our favor. All those things added up, plus the practical timing of things, just say that it will get done sometime this year. For us, we think the project is going to get done. It's just a question of when, and it'll be fine.

In terms of the bankers, we're still working with Guggenheim and Citi.

Operator

Peter Gastreich, Water Tower Research.

Peter Gastreich

Yes, thank you. Excuse me, Peter Gastreich here. So thanks for the presentation today, and congratulations to the team on executing your strategy. Just a couple questions for me. The first one is on Red Trail. Just in terms of cash coming from carbon credits there, has that started from day one?

And are you able to give any color on the broad assumptions for that $30 million to $60 million dollar adjust to the expectation and what the contribution of carbon credits might look like? Is that range more the results of a commodity variable, or do you have a range in credits in there as well? Thank you.

Patrick Gruber

Eric, I think you're probably in the best position to describe this. It's your chart that he's probably looking at, Peter's probably looking at.

Eric Frey

Yes, sure, Peter. So just to give you a sense, the carbon intensity using the 45Z GREET model for (technical difficulty) FFO plant and CCS is about 21 grams of future growth for (inaudible). And so the math, the way the 45Z tax credits works is basically you get $0.02 per gallon of tax credit per CI point that's below [50] -- okay, about.

And so at a 21 CI score, which is really industry-leading carbon intensity because this ethanol plant is so unique because it has carbon capture, and it's one of the few ethanol plants in the world that actually operates carbon capture. I think Pat mentioned that you think we want to basically (technical difficulty). That means that the 45Z tax credit loan is to get math on about 67 million gallons per year of volume. It is worth somewhere between $30 million to $40 million just that tax credit.

So there's other elements of value that we're targeting, but that's a big element of how you can get to kind of the range that we're talking about between $30 million to $60 million. That's a large range and as we kind of get more experience in your results as we go through the year, you can see that just that tax credit alone gets us a pretty good foundation to achieving that target.

And Chris, feel free to jump in if you want to add the detail of that as well, but that's kind of how we map, Peter.

Peter Gastreich

Okay, great. Thanks, Eric.

Patrick Gruber

Sorry, Peter, could you understand him?

Peter Gastreich

I got most of it, but yeah, it was not a good line. We could follow up afterwards as well.

Patrick Gruber

Well. Yeah, so the short version is this ethanol margins, they're low right now. So they should come back in the summertime like always to follow the normal cycle of ethanol, so that'd be the normal contribution you'd expect from us, 67 million gallons per year ethanol plant. It'll be the normalness there.

And then I think that a large part of what you see on that slide is the monetization of the 45Z. It's a fascinating thing. There's a marketplace for the 45Zs already, even though they're still -- their law, they have to do them. It's the la. And so people are betting on that already, and so it's very interesting and a large part of that is the 45Z.

Peter Gastreich

Okay, great, got it. Thank you very much for that. And just the second question I just noticed that in your 10K that there's disclosure about the weakness and controls. Could you just expand on this and what exactly is meant by the auditor there? Thank you.

Patrick Gruber

Yeah, this is one of these ones of as we're going through the end of the year stuff with the auditors and then also ourselves on our internal audit, we had a pattern of mischaracterizing. We're treating a transaction as expenses where they should have been capitalized.

So for me, this is one of these ones that I find very frustrating because we were mis-categorizing things. It was a couple of contracts and some just transaction expenses for capital or for projects that should have been capitalized.

So it turns out it doesn't hurt our cash, it doesn't hurt -- our earnings per share got better because stuff got capitalized. And so it's one of these very frustrating things where we made mistakes on the technical interpretation of the rules of what it is, we got it wrong. And so that's just part of it and it's irritating, but that's what that one's about.

We're already in the path through mediation for it as well. But because that's about training as you saw in the K, then you saw it's about training people, getting the right people, et cetera.

Peter Gastreich

Okay. Thank you very much, Pat.

Operator

James Arett, Morgan Stanley.

James Arett

Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question here. I was wondering about the Verity portion of the business. And I guess I'm curious about do you guys have any projections about revenue? I know that that would be very forward-looking and nothing in concrete, but any like maybe a three-year and a five-year projection about what kind of revenue that that could bring in?

Patrick Gruber

Yeah, Paul, how about that?

Paul Bloom

Yeah, it's a good question. And we're -- I mean, the good news is we got first revenue last year like we said we were going to do. And so now what we see is that, well, I don't have the three- and the five-year projections for you, but we're signing up more customers which come with typical subscription fees, so software-as-a-service.

And then some of the agreements that we have in place have a profit share, which we've talked about in the past, profit and revenue share. So some of those can be pretty sizable as we think about how this is going to grow and go forward. But yeah, still too early to say a lot of the same things when we think about calculating carbon values and doing carbon accounting and profit shares that we've got built into some of those agreements.

James Arett

Got you. Thank.

Operator

(Operator Instructions) [Karen McGinnis].

Karen McGinnis

Yes, good afternoon. I had a quick question. Given there's a number of issues around what we got to achieve for the DOE loan, how long does that commitment stay open?

Patrick Gruber

It depends on -- well, that's up to them. I mean, I've seen them extend them for years. So we'll see. The way we view this is there's -- we're going to -- we have -- for us, we don't view this as a binary thing and a lot of shareholders do. I don't view it that way. It's not binary.

This project makes a lot of sense. It'll happen. The DOE loan makes a lot of sense, project financing. In the meantime, I got other projects to build too. We're going to get those built, and we'll do them a little bit differently than a classic project finance.

So it's not a binary outcome. Our game plan is to be profitable irrespective of net 01. So this paradigm that people have that, somehow, we have to have that, it's going to be a miracle. And then -- and wow, we better get cash flow from it when you think about the timelines.

So our whole game is to not have to raise money again except for very creative reasons. That's our whole game plan here. So it's not at all that paradigm of one thing or the other. I am keen on setting the right precedents in the market, setting the right price points, setting the right -- all the precedents of value. I'm very keen on that because that sets the stage for going forward.

Karen McGinnis

Thank you. The second question, just a simple question. Just listening to the call, there's a lot of moving pieces here, and there seems to be a lot of -- we're going in a lot of different directions. What do you see is kind of the top two or three priorities as the CEO of the company?

Patrick Gruber

Are you kidding me? This is -- are you freaking kidding me? What do you think they are? Really? We're unclear? Have you been -- you read our presentations, go look at our documentation. Route to -- first, we're developing the marketplace for alcohols into hydrocarbons and commercializing those products. We're establishing the carbon value for those same products.

And along the way, we're building our network infrastructure in a property portfolio, so we have a serious competitive advantage. And you know what, we've got a strong balance sheet. Those are the things. Crystal clear. They're spelled out in our documents.

Karen McGinnis

Okay. Thank you.

Operator

That does conclude our Q&A session for today, and I would like to turn the call over to Pat for closing remarks. Please go ahead.

Patrick Gruber

It's been interesting times during the transition with the new administration. The number of questions that we're getting from the press is amazing. I think I've had something like 55 interviews with press. Usually, they have the wrong information about things.

And so what I find is the noise is going to have to settle down, and I think we'll see money flow back into our sector. It has gone away because people don't know what to make of anything. That's all part of it.

So I think we're in great shape. Our balance sheet is strong, our technologies are strong, our capabilities are strong. We continue to make progress in the marketplace.

This carbon value that we talked about is real, and it's separate than just regulatory value. That is the ultimate game is to make sure that you have technologies that are competitively making products on a cost basis, and there's a value-added attribute, and it's carbon.

So thanks for participating. Thanks for listening in.

About 1,200 of its local staff will not be part of the deal and will remain with Siemens Energy, the company said.","About 700 gigawatts (GW) of renewable power capacity was added in 2024 to set another annual record as the world’s appetite for energy continued to swell, according to the global energy review released this week by the International Energy Agency (IEA).

In all, the IEA reported global energy demand grew “faster than the average rate over the past decade” at 2.2% last year. The growth was driven by electrification, digitalization, data center expansions and rising temperatures.

All forms of energy saw greater demand. However, renewables—led by solar—accounted for the largest share of growth at 38%. Following renewables were natural gas, 28%; coal, 15%; oil at 11% and nuclear at 8%, according to the report.

“Generation from solar PV and wind increased by a record 670 TWh, while generation from natural gas rose by 170 TWh and coal by 90 TWh,” the IEA said. “In the European Union, the share of generation provided by solar PV and wind surpassed the combined share of coal and gas for the first time. In the United States, solar PV and wind’s share rose to 16%, overtaking that of coal. In China, solar PV and wind reached nearly 20% of total generation.”

Energy demand is expected to continue increasing as the world’s population grows and economies strengthen amid a push toward electrification and lower-carbon energies in parts of the world. The report showed that more than 80% of global energy demand growth came from emerging and developing economies led by China, where demand slowed but still grew, and India. Both countries, however, saw coal use rise due to “intense heatwaves.”

“There are many uncertainties in the world today and different narratives about energy—but this new data-driven IEA report puts some clear facts on the table about what is happening globally,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “What is certain is that electricity use is growing rapidly, pulling overall energy demand along with it to such an extent that it is enough to reverse years of declining energy consumption in advanced economies.

The U.S. and EU also returned to growth mode.

Of the fossil fuels, natural gas demand grew the most worldwide, rising by 115 Bcm in 2024 compared with an average of about 75 Bcm annually over the past decade.

“The result is that demand for all major fuels and energy technologies increased in 2024, with renewables covering the largest share of the growth, followed by natural gas,” Birol said. “And the strong expansion of solar, wind, nuclear power and EVs is increasingly loosening the links between economic growth and emissions.”

Eni, Saipem Extend Biorefining Collaboration Agreement

Eni and Saipem agreed to continue collaborating on efforts to advance biorefining projects on March 27 with the extension of a November 2023 agreement between the two companies.

As part of the extended agreement, Eni said it plans to further develop its biorefining capacity with new initiatives focused on biofuels for aviation, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and for land and sea mobility.

Eni recently awarded Saipem a contract to start detailed engineering and procurement services as well as purchase of critical equipment to upgrade the Enilive biorefinery in Porto Marghera, near Venice, Italy, according to the release. The project aims to boost the facility’s capacity to 600,000 tons per year, up from 400,000 tons per year, beginning in 2027. The companies also plan to add SAF production in 2027.

TotalEnergies to Invest in Six German Battery Energy Storage Projects

TotalEnergies said on March 26 it would invest $172.7 million for six new battery energy storage systems with a total capacity of 221 megawatts (MW) in Germany.

Most of the batteries, the company said, will be supplied by Saft and developed by TotalEnergies affiliate Kyon Energy. The projects are scheduled for commissioning in early 2026.

“The implementation and integration of all these battery projects will allow us to supply our customers with clean firm power, contributing directly to our targeted 12% profitability in this activity,” TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanné said.

The projects are being pursued as Total takes step to help strengthen the German power market by boosting renewables backed by battery energy storage systems.

(Reuters) Polish utility PGE plans to invest about $4.7 billion in battery storage projects, CEO Dariusz Marzec said March 24.

With a growing share of intermittent renewable capacity in the system replacing stable electricity generation from coal, Poland urgently needs to develop battery storage to continue its energy transformation.

“The total value of investment in large-scale energy storage facilities is about 6 billion zlotys,” Marzec told reports, adding that this was for six large projects, with plans to invest a further 12 billion zlotys in smaller facilities across the country.

The company said it plans to build a total of 85 energy storage projects to increase its storage capacity to more than 17,000 megawatt hours, which it says will provide energy for about 2.5 million households.

Calgary Region Hydrogen Hub Opens in Canada

A hydrogen hub managed by the Transition Accelerator has opened in the Calgary area of Alberta, Canada, bringing together established hydrogen producers and consumers, Calgary Economic Development Ltd. said March 21 in a news release.

The Calgary Region Hydrogen Hub (CRH2) takes shape amid global efforts to establish competitive low and non-emitting industries. The hub will initially focus on airports, heat and power, hydrogen corridors, trains and industrial and municipal fleets, according to the release. “The hub will bring together experts across industries with early potential to anchor a self-sustaining hydrogen economy, working closely with industry partners to coordinate research and initiatives, facilitate application of hydrogen solutions and overcome barriers to hydrogen development,” the release states. “The CRH2 will also serve as a point of connection for Calgary’s hydrogen ecosystem, sharing insights, analytics and inspiration to provide the region with a competitive edge.”

Calgary Economic Development, the Transition Accelerator, Wheatland County, the City of Calgary and Prairies Economic Development Canada are among the hub’s initial members.

US Weighs Funding Cuts to Four Hydrogen Hubs

(Reuters) The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is weighing funding cuts to four of seven hydrogen hubs selected under a $7 billion federal program, according to a source briefed on the matter.

The hubs, part of former President Joe Biden’s effort to decarbonize the U.S. economy, are intended to jumpstart the production of “clean hydrogen” and the infrastructure needed to get it to industrial users like steelmakers and cement plants.

Washington has slashed funding for clean energy projects since Trump took office in January. His administration is prioritizing fossil fuel production as part of its “energy dominance” agenda.

The four hubs targeted for cuts include those in the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, California and the Mid-Atlantic, according to a list circulated by the agency. They represent about $4 billion in pledged funding.

Funding would be preserved for hubs in Appalachia, the Gulf Coast and the upper Midwest.

“The Department of Energy is conducting a department-wide review,” a DOE spokesperson said when asked about the list, which was first reported by Politico. “The review is ongoing, and speculation by anonymous sources about the results of the review are just that—speculation.”

The hubs that could have their funding cut would largely serve Democratic states, while the three hubs that would be kept are located in Republican states.

A California hydrogen trade group said the DOE should reconsider pulling funding from the Golden State hub, which is known as ARCHES.

“The many benefits of hydrogen energy—American energy independence, cleaner air for all of us to breathe, and good paying, blue-collar jobs—are not partisan issues,” Teresa Cooke, executive director of the California Hydrogen Coalition, said in a statement. “Projects like ARCHES are already benefiting the U.S. economy and removing funding will only hurt the people of our state, including more than 6 million who supported President Trump in the 2024 election.”

In an emailed statement, ARCHES said it was committed to establishing a hydrogen ecosystem, creating jobs and delivering economic benefits to California residents.

Officials from the other hydrogen hubs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Lightsource BP Brings 180-MW Solar Farm Online in Louisiana

Lightsource BP has begun commercial operations at its 180-MW solar project in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, the company said March 26.

Called Prairie Ronde, the $170 million solar farm is capable of generating enough electricity to power 31,000 homes, the company said, while abating 231,800 metric tons of carbon emissions annually.

“The Prairie Ronde solar project is a powerful example of domestic energy investment in action,” said Emilie Wangerman, COO of Lightsource BP USA. “Working together with our partners, we are building a more resilient grid with US-made products, supporting underserved communities, creating jobs, introducing homegrown energy solutions and reducing our nation’s dependence on foreign imports.”

The solar farm includes equipment sourced from U.S. manufacturers, such as solar panels from Arizona-based First Solar and smart solar trackers from New Mexico-based Array Technologies, BP said.

ENGIE Adds 900 MW Solar, Storage to Portfolio from Ares Management

ENGIE North America said March 24 it added 900 MW of solar and storage assets from Ares Management Infrastructure to its portfolio, deepening the companies’ partnership.

The assets consist of three solar projects in operation across the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and Midcontinent Independent System Operator and one co-located battery storage project connected to ERCOT, ENGIE said in a press release.

The addition brings the partnership’s portfolio to 3.7 GW of investment in U.S. generation, the company said.

ENGIE will retain a controlling share in the portfolio and will continue to operate and manage the assets.

ENGIE currently has over 11 GW of renewable production in operation or construction across the U.S. and Canada. Globally, the company has 51 GW of renewables and storage in operation and is targeting 95 GW by 2030.

“The expansion of our relationship with Ares reflects the strength of ENGIE's portfolio of assets and our track record of delivering, operating and financing growth in the U.S.,” said. Dave Carroll, chief renewables officer and senior vice president, ENGIE North America. “The addition of another almost 1 GW of generation and storage to our existing relationship reflects the commitment both ENGIE and Ares have to meeting growing demand for power in the U.S. and continuing to deploy clean energy.”

Wind

Vattenfall to Build Germany’s Largest Offshore Wind Farm

(Reuters) Swedish power utility Vattenfall said on March 25 it has made a final investment decision for two wind farm projects in the German North Sea, Nordlicht 1 and 2, the first of which is expected to become Germany’s biggest offshore wind farm.

Vattenfall said in a statement it had agreed to buy back the 49% stake in the Nordlicht cluster sold to BASF in 2024, while the German chemicals group will receive access to long-term supply of renewable electricity.

Construction for Nordlicht 1 and 2, which will have a total capacity of 1.6 GW, is planned to begin in 2026, Vattenfall said.

Expected to be fully operational in 2028, the two wind farms will be able to produce around 6 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity per year, equivalent to the electricity consumption of 1.6 million German households.

In related news, BASF on March 25 flagged a non-cash effective disposal loss of around 300 million euros (US$324 million) for its first quarter earnings following the sale of its 49% stake in the Nordlicht cluster to Vattenfall.

Siemens Energy Sells Most of Indian Wind Unit in Latest Revamp

(Reuters) Siemens Energy will sell 90% of its wind turbine business in India and Sri Lanka to an investor group led by the climate investment arm of buyout group TPG, in the latest move aimed at fixing its struggling renewables division.

Siemens Gamesa, Siemens Energy’s loss-making wind turbine division, holds a 30% market share in India but had said it was considering strategic options for the business, citing cut-throat competition.

“It’s a very fragmented and competitive landscape,” Vinod Philip, Siemens Energy’s board member in charge of Siemens Gamesa, told Reuters. “This deal allows us as Siemens Gamesa to tackle the other markets in a more focused manner.”

Philip said the new company could also become a cost-effective Indian supplier to Siemens Gamesa, helping to diversify its global supply chain.

No financial details of the transaction were disclosed.

As part of the deal, Siemens Energy will transfer about 1,000 employees and two manufacturing plants in India to the new entity. About 1,200 of its local staff will not be part of the deal and will remain with Siemens Energy, the company said.

Siemens Gamesa has an installation base of nearly 10 GW in India and provides service to more than 7 GW worth of turbines under long-term agreements, it said, adding the market was expected to add 57 GW of capacity by 2032.

Philip said the focus remained on fixing Siemens Gamesa’s onshore business, which has suffered from a quality crisis around its newer generation 4.X and 5.X turbine models. An updated version of the 4.X turbine has been brought back into the market and Philip said there were “good conversations” with customers in Europe about it.

That compares with a R$1.1 billion loss during the equivalent period of 2023.

Sao Paulo-based Gol did not hold a conference call with investors as it works to emerge from Chapter 11 restructuring.

Gol reports that the devlauation of Brazilian currency hit the carrier hard in 2024, with total costs rising 3% compared with the full year of 2023.

It attributes the increase in expenses primarily to “exchange rate depreciation”, though higher airport fees and labour costs also played a role.

Indeed, the carrier’s fourth-quarter loss from depreciation and amoritisation increased by nearly 30% compared with the prior-year period, to R$544 million from R$435 million.

There are bright spots in the carrier’s year-end financial report, however.

Gol says that passenger capacity increased througout the year “due mainly to the introduction of new routes” and the re-introduction of others, pointing to the restoration of flights between Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre.

The carrier opened four new international bases in 2024, with new outposts in Cancun, Aruba, Costa Rica and Bogota.

”Another important point was the expansion of the international network and the reconstruction of connectivity, especially with Rio de Janeiro, one of Gol largest hubs,” the airline says.

Gol took delivery of eight new Boeing 737 Max 8s last year, including three in the third quarter. It ended the year with a fleet of 52 Max jets.

On 31 December, Gol’s full fleet included 138 jets – 114 of which are operational.

Gol says it “ends the year with a well-built network for 2025 and a larger operational fleet by seven aircraft” compared with the end of 2023.

”This increase in operational aircraft was result of the Chapter 11 restructuring efforts and lessor negotiations… to support growth and ensure the company’s efficient operation to build the foundation for Gol’s performance in 2025 and its long-term plan,” the airline says.

Earlier this month, the carrier said it had secured exit financing from unnamed investors as it works to emerge from bankruptcy as “a well-capitalised standalone company”.

Gol told shareholders that it had secured from “certain investors” $1.25 of $1.9 billion in debt instruments to be issued as part of its restructuring plan.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/9/7/1/108971_shutterstock_1359480122_606776.jpg,N,,2025-03-29 12:56:20.409645

The Gulfstream G700's remarkable ultra-long range of 7,750 NM (8,918 mi, 14,353 km) positions it as a leading business jet.","Since its beginning in 1958, Gulfstream Aerospace Company has been paving the skies with visionary private jet models like the Gulfstream IV and the G650 series, which have become symbols of modernity and elegance. This Savannah, Georgia-based plane maker has engineered unique design qualities, as seen in their continuously developed products.

Gulfstream's latest jet in production, the cutting-edge G700, was introduced on October 22, 2019, at the NBAA Convention & Exhibition in Las Vegas. The G700 boasts one of the longest flying ranges in private aviation history, with adaptable cabins and advanced avionics technology. The company continually challenges the boundaries of what an aircraft can achieve, such as the upcoming G800, whether it's enhancing fuel efficiency or speed limits.

The first operator of the G700 was Qatar Executive , the private jet company of Qatar Airways, which received the world’s first Gulfstream G700 Aircraft to Doha on May 22, 2024. Today, QE’s G700 fleet has reached six jets, as the company added two additional jets on January 6, 2025. Another four G700s are scheduled for QE delivery between 2025 and 2026, bringing the company's total fleet to ten.

“Qatar Executive has been a valued Gulfstream customer for nearly 10 years. We are honoured to have them as our international partner for the launch and first deliveries of the all-new G700. We look forward to growing their fleet in the months ahead,” said Mark Burns, President of Gulfstream.

On September 2, 2024, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, was seen in Los Angeles with his new $80 million Gulfstream G700 jet at Van Nuys Airport, one of the busiest general aviation airports in the world. A private jet service provider, ABS Jets, acquired the G700 in December 2024. Additionally, the Tanzanian government acquired the jet for VIP transport.

G700 blends ultra-long range and speed

Due to its capabilities, the G700 flagship stands out as a superior private business aviation selection, with remarkable demand in the market. This explains why Gulfstream Aerospace’s large-cabin deliveries jumped by 32.6% to 118 in 2024, as reported by the Gulfstream umbrella company, General Dynamics. Gulfstream expects to deliver 150 jets in 2025.

The Gulfstream G700's remarkable ultra-long range of 7,750 NM (8,918 mi, 14,353 km) positions it as a leading business jet. Its capability transforms global travel, connecting cities and continents, such as Las Vegas to Macau or London and Singapore, in a single non-stop flight. This boosts the jet's life and durability, eliminating the need for refueling stops and saving time and workload.

From there, the maximum speed of Mach 0.935 (617 knots, 712 MPH, 1,145 km/h) takes off to its highest point. This near-supersonic speed shortens travel time and enhances the overall efficiency of long-distance journeys, promoting the aircraft as the fastest business jet in private aviation. By minimizing the hours spent in transit, the G700 allows passengers to maximize productivity by executing efficient business schedules.

Thanks to the Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 engines

The Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 engine, designed for Gulfstream's G700 and G800 , is a leading business aviation powerhouse. It combines the most efficient engine core with a new low-pressure system, resulting in an 8% increase in take-off thrust at 18,250 lb (81.21 kN).

On September 20, 2022, RR announced that the Pearl® 700 had received certification from the European Union’s Aviation Safety Agency EASA . The Pearl 700 proved its reliability and performance under extreme conditions, experiencing cold start temperatures where fuel viscosity was comparable to honey. The engine has performed equally well in hot conditions and can run on 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel SAF.

The engine also offers a 12% better thrust-to-weight ratio and 5% higher efficiency while maintaining low noise and emissions performance. Designed with Gulfstream, the Pearl 700 combines the trusted BR700 architecture with the new Pearl core and Advance2 portfolio technologies. The Advance2 Core technology offers the most efficient core in business aviation.

Ultra-low emissions combustor with greener technology and lower noise.

2-stage HP turbine with shroudless blade design and enhanced aerodynamics.

The G700's styling

Cutting-edge engineering minimizes turbulence and vibration, so the passengers onboard enjoy a quiet, comfortable cabin even as the aircraft hurtles through the atmosphere. When the G700 flies at 41,000 ft (12,497 m), passengers will feel refreshed as if they are at 2,916 ft (889 m), representing the lowest cabin altitude in its class, according to Gulfstream.

This cabin altitude feature is particularly beneficial on ultra-long-range flights because the outside air pressure is extremely low when cruising at high altitudes, leading to discomfort and health issues if not properly managed. Lower cabin altitude means passengers experience less physiological stress, reduced fatigue, and improved overall well-being.

The aircraft offers an exceptionally spacious cabin, bringing up to 19 passengers in up to five individual living areas, including a dedicated private meeting room and a master suite with a shower. The cabins have been crafted to meet high standards and comfort.

The G700 offers a spacious stretched cabin with natural lighting through 20 oval windows. The cabin air is 100% fresh and refilled every two to three minutes, and an ionizing system is also included. The G700 can also be customized to meet passengers' unique needs, providing a high-quality business jet. Moreover, the passenger experience delights include the jet's revolutionary lighting system.

The baggage compartment volume of 195 cu ft (5.52 m³) offers both flexibility and convenience, catering to the needs of passengers traveling for leisure or business. Enough to hold up to 48 checked suitcases. This space can handle more than just personal luggage—it can also be used for sports equipment or other bulky items often carried by business travelers.

G700's outer design

The aircraft maintains aerodynamic stability with a height of 25 ft 5 in (7.75 m). Its length of 109 ft 10 in (33.48 m) accommodates a spacious interior, advanced systems, and ample storage area. Meanwhile, the wingspan of 103 ft (31.39 m) enhances lift and efficiency.

The winglets are upward-curved extensions at the wingtips made of composite and metallic materials, optimizing weight and enhancing appearance. These advancements redefine high-speed, ultra-long-range flight expectations, contributing to the state-of-the-art fuselage and wing designs, which reduce drag and boost aerodynamic efficiency.

In comparison, the G700's height is slightly lower than the Global 7500 and Falcon 10X, contributing to its profile. It is more concise than the Bombardier Global 7500 and Dassault Falcon 10X. The G700's wingspan is comparable to its competitors, ensuring excellent lift and fuel efficiency.

Leading-edge technology

The Gulfstream G700's Symmetry Flight Deck is a cutting-edge cockpit design revolutionizing the piloting experience. It incorporates active control sidesticks, which are electronically linked to provide tactile feedback. This enhances pilot coordination and situational awareness, ensuring smoother handling and superior safety, especially in challenging conditions.

The flight deck has extensive touch-screen displays, a data concentration network, and the award-winning Gulfstream Predictive Landing Performance System. Its flight deck system prioritizes safety and efficiency, offering an intuitive and user-friendly interface to reduce pilot fatigue. This makes it one of business aviation's most advanced flight decks today.

These displays are part of the Honeywell Primus Epic avionics system, which includes features like SmartView Synthetic Vision for 3D terrain visualization and Next Generation Flight Management Systems NGFMS to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce pilot workload. Moreover, the Enhanced Flight Vision System EFVS improves visibility in low-light or adverse weather conditions.

Eco-sustainable technologies

In relationship with the environment, the G700 aircraft is designed with innovative airframe, mechanical systems, and flight deck technologies to improve safety and reduce fuel consumption and environmental impact. It is built by world-renowned engine experts to set new standards for powerful, quiet, and efficient flight.

The manufacturer uses internationally recognized environmental management systems like ISO 14001, incorporates robotics into production processes, and installs drought-resistant landscaping and energy-saving lighting, heating, and cooling systems.

Despite a 1,150% surge in global SAF supply over the past three years, new project announcements fell by 50% to 70% from 2022 to 2023 due to rising energy and operational costs, as well as economic uncertainty.

SAF currently accounts for only 0.3% of global jet fuel usage in 2024. In Europe, airlines are mandated to use 2% SAF this year, increasing to 6% by 2030. However, the high cost of SAF—three to five times more than conventional jet fuel—remains a significant barrier. BCG’s survey of over 500 executives from 200 aviation companies revealed that airlines and airports allocate just 1% to 3% of their budgets to SAF investment.

BCG Managing Director Pelayo Losada noted that while the industry is moving in the right direction, progress is far too slow. He warned that supply could fall 30% to 45% short of what’s needed by 2030 to meet climate goals. Losada criticized the widespread industry attitude of expecting others to lead the change, urging greater cross-sector collaboration.

Compounding the problem, countries like China are seeing SAF project delays due to unclear policy frameworks and low consumption.

Speaking during a gasworld webinar, Bruce Woerner of Woerner CO2 Consulting said the threat was real and should not be ignored, given the way the supply and demand picture is shaping.
He said the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act, with its 45Q tax credit, which offers $85 per tonne for CO2 sequestration and $60 per tonne for utilisation, was about to be felt, as projects begin to come onstream.

Speaking during a gasworld webinar, Bruce Woerner of Woerner CO2 Consulting said the threat was real and should not be ignored, given the way the supply and demand picture is shaping.

He said the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act, with its 45Q tax credit, which offers $85 per tonne for CO2 sequestration and $60 per tonne for utilisation, was about to be felt, as projects begin to come onstream.

He said incentives have encouraged ethanol producers, in particular, to redirect CO2 away from the merchant market in favour of applications such as sustainable aviation fuel or for storage to secure carbon credits.

“We [have already seen] companies cancelling contracts or letting them expire, holding back CO2 that would previously have gone to the industrial gas sector,” Woerner said.

Scott Vanderberg, President of Reliant Gases, which is a major supplier of CO2 in the US previously warned similarly at a gasworld event that a third of US CO2 capacity, around 10,000 tonnes per day, could disappear over time from the merchant market.

Woerner today said that the industry may have gained some breathing room following delays to major sequestration infrastructure, including the $9bn Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, but there was no room for complacency, he argued.

Beyond sequestration, many traditional CO2 sources are also in long-term decline. Ethanol facilities, which account for around 40% of US supply, were heavily affected during the Covid-19 pandemic, when fuel demand dropped. Five US ethanol plants producing CO2 were permanently shut down as a result. Others reduced capacity, while new sources have remained limited.

Compounding this, industrial gas producers have faced supply interruptions due to ageing infrastructure and unexpected shutdowns. In 2022, a purity issue at the Jackson Dome CO2 source in Mississippi, which accounts for 18% of the country’s supply, was followed by overlapping outages at major ammonia plants in Augusta and Hopewell.

After an extended period of volatility, last year was relatively stable in terms of CO2 supply but Woerner said that risks remain.

“The easy sources were tapped years ago,” he said. “Today’s options tend to be smaller or lower in purity, which means higher costs.”

Woerner said investment in new sources was essential, but the current economics are challenging. The best near-term opportunity lies in renewable natural gas, known as biomethane in Europe, which typically produces high-purity CO2, but at smaller scale. Many landfill and wastewater sources also require advanced monitoring and treatment due to variability in input materials.

All the same, Woerner said progress was being made and it needed to ramp up.

“It is not clear how stable 45Q will be, and companies are cautious,” he said. “But there is still appetite for action, particularly from larger players with sustainability targets.”","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/gwml/CO2-Computer-generated-3D-illustration.jpg",N,,2025-03-29 00:56:26.100939

by Marleen Kaesebier (Reuters) The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry is falling short of its 2030 targets with production not ramping up quickly enough, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found in a report published on Thursday (March 27, 2025).

European airlines are this year expected to meet a mandate of 2% SAF use in their jet fuel, with that set to rise to 6% by 2030. But many have lamented the high cost of the fuel, which is typically three to five times more expensive than traditional jet fuel.

The report found that airlines and airports are investing only 1% to 3% of revenue or budget allocation to SAF, with high production costs and fuel prices remaining the major challenges to adoption.

""We are going in the positive direction, but clearly not at the speed we need,"" BCG Managing Director and Partner Pelayo Losada said of his findings in the co-authored report that surveyed more than 500 executives at about 200 aviation-related companies.

""Despite continuing to scale the availability of sustainable aviation fuel, and we see that trend very clearly, there is a slowdown in the development of projects and even bigger gaps to some of the commitments that some of the companies have made,"" Losada said.

Reuters reported last month that low consumption and a lack of policy guidance have led to delays of some SAF projects in China.

While the global aviation industry is aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and some countries have SAF mandates in place, the fuel accounted for only about 0.3% of global jet fuel production in 2024.

BCG's report highlights that while SAF supply increased 1,150% worldwide over the last three years, announcements for new production facilities fell by 50% to 70% from 2022 to 2023.

BCG says this was largely due to economic uncertainty and higher energy and operating costs.

It now projects supply to fall 30% to 45% short of commercial aviation's 2030 targets.

Losada said many industry participants had adopted a mentality of ""others will solve the problems for me"", and he called for cross-industry collaboration. READ MORE",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-03-29 04:56:10.936551

The Big One

Conor Madigan, founder and CEO of Chicago climate-tech company Aether Fuels, thinks the United States could — and should — be a leader in sustainable aviation-fuel manufacturing, but first it has to get the policy right.

""We can make it a great manufacturing opportunity for the U.S., where we build plants [and] create jobs, not only at the factories but also to source all the feedstocks — something which disproportionately benefits rural communities,"" he told Chicago Inno at a media event this week. ""It's a great opportunity. The key to it, though, is that you have to have the best manufacturing technology because it's a commodity product. It's not like 'My SAF is better than your SAF.'""

Becoming an industry leader is going to be all about which companies — and the countries they operate out of — have the best technology to develop the cheapest and most efficient manufacturing plants, he added.

What else you need to know

What's next for Chicago startup Nerdio after reaching unicorn status

A Chicago startup that helps companies move virtual desktops to the cloud joined an exclusive club this month as Chicago's newest unicorn.

A term first coined in a 2013 TechCrunch article that refers to a tech startup that's reached a market valuation of at least $1B, hitting unicorn status is considered an important milestone for any tech startup but it's become a little more exclusive these days with more down rounds and fewer companies going public, falling from peaks reached in 2021.

Nerdio is looking to buck that trend, however. The Chicago startup last week announced a $500M Series C raise led by General Atlantic, with participation from Lead Edge Capital and StepStone. The investment quadrupled Nerdio's valuation in the two years since it raised its $117M Series B and pushed it over the $1B mark.

Hosted at Club Med Magna Marbella on Spain’s stunning Costa del Sol, the event brought together franchise and affiliate agency owners and managers, Transat Travel/Voyages Transat agency leaders, members of the TDC leadership team and key preferred partners – all focused on taking their businesses to the next level.

A Strong Finish with Practical Insights

The final day of the conference featured an interactive workshop led by executive coach Cloé Caron, designed to help attendees maintain momentum when transitioning back to daily operations.

“With this session, we wanted to bridge the gap between the enthusiasm felt at the end of a conference and the reality of returning to routine,” said Karine Gagnon, TDC’s General Manager. “We aimed to provide agency owners and managers with tools to sustain this momentum, whether by introducing new ideas or implementing refined strategies. Thanks to our innovative format this year, participants will have a second opportunity to revisit their action plans in a virtual session with Cloé Caron at the end of May.”

For Dianne Jackson, Director of Franchise and Affiliate Members, the conference delivered significant value to attendees. “I am really proud of what TDC has offered our owners and managers this week. They developed action plans with nearly 30 preferred partners through Partner Business Reviews, optimizing their business relationships. They also attended impactful TDC Talks – short, targeted sessions on pressing topics such as AI-driven marketing efficiency, meaningful one-on-one meetings and operational cost reduction,” she said.

Attendees compiled key takeaways in the TDC Playbook, a personalized business guide developed throughout the conference. The process began before the event, with participants defining clear business objectives. Dedicated recap sessions each day, led by Caron, helped reinforce key learnings and prioritize actionable steps. “By the end of the week, attendees had not just insights, but a concrete plan tailored to their specific business goals,” Jackson explained.

A Week of Innovation and Growth

Before attendees departed for a final evening in Costa del Sol, Karine Gagnon reflected on the week’s highlights. “Innovation and business are the two words that best define this enriching week. From fresh approaches to conference structure to practical business strategies, this year’s NLC was all about tangible outcomes,” she said.

One of the standout moments was the Transat evening on March 26, hosted at the Melia Costa del Sol. “I am really proud of the close relationship that TDC has with its preferred partners, particularly Transat. The incredible evening the tour operator organized for our owners and agency managers was a true reflection of the trust and loyalty that binds us,” Gagnon noted.

Sustainability Commitment

Gagnon also highlighted TDC’s latest sustainability initiative. “I am more than proud to announce that, in alignment with Transat’s corporate responsibility plan, TDC is supporting certified greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction projects to offset all emissions generated by air travel for the NLC,” she said.

TDC has financed credits covering nearly 137,000 kg of CO₂ emissions, directing funds toward climate solutions and sustainable aviation fuel projects through Transat’s Act on Your Carbon Footprint program in partnership with CHOOOSE.

One-on-One Business Reviews: A Winning Formula

The revamped format of individual business review sessions between agency owners and preferred partners proved highly successful.

“This edition of the National Leadership Conference was truly refreshing,” said Doreen White, Manager at Marlin Travel in Victoria. “I particularly appreciated the one-on-one meetings with partners, which will undoubtedly benefit our business. The variety of sessions, including TDC Talks, kept us engaged and energized.”

The positive feedback extended to partners as well. Patrick Brousseau, National Client Manager at Manulife, praised the new initiatives, especially the Beyond the Brochure talk show. “But it was the individual meetings that were by far the most beneficial. This dedicated, uninterrupted time to discuss action plans with agency owners will be highly profitable for everyone,” he said.

Transat’s leadership also recognized the event’s value. Renée Boisvert, Vice-President of Tour Operator Products and Sales, attended her first NLC and was impressed by the depth of discussions. “Throughout the week, the TDC team fostered an environment that encouraged meaningful exchanges, strategic reflection and collaborative growth,” she said.

Alcohol-derived SAF to be showcased at 2025 UK net zero conference

Aviation fuel derived from alcohol and satellite monitoring systems for biomass will be among the innovations display at the 2025 Innovation Zero World Congress next month.

The UK Government-backed event will take place from 29-30 April in London with the aim to look at developments in net zero policy and innovation.

For 2025, attendees will be able to meet the teams and individuals behind a range of innovations in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and lower carbon approaches to business and transport.

These companies include LanzaJet, which has developed a patented Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology that it says can convert Ehtanol into SAF.

A first commercial demonstration plant for the technology was opened in the US in 2024, with the company also opting to built a second site in Teesside in the UK to demonstrate the potential for new sources of lower carbon fuels.

Other companies at the event will include UK-based start-up Carbon Neutral Fuels that will be demonstrating its ‘Power-to-Liquid’ e-fuel production technology that looks at using captured carbon and hydrogen to reduce a reliance on fossil fuels.

The conference will also see the launch of the UK’s first Biomass climate satellite mission to help monitor changes in the world’s tropical forests and the impacts on naturally stored carbon. The Space4Climate project is being Chaired by the UK Space Agency.

‘Don’t just chuck things out’, say North Shields kids

North Tyneside Council is highlighting the recycling and reuse efforts of local pupils as it promotes circular policies in the borough.

Students from Christ Church Primary School are running an ‘Eco Club’ reuse shop and encouraging parents to repair items.

“At school we learn about how important it is to repair something when it’s broken so it can be reused, or to recycle it,” said Harry, aged 7.

“We want more adults to do what we do because it’s so important to protect our planet and it’s our future,” he continued. “Grown ups…please don’t just chuck things out!”

The authority has recently opened a reuse facility at the household waste and recycling centre in North Shields, with some items already having been donated to schools.

“This survey shows a clear desire to do the right thing when it comes to recycling EPS,” said the Federation’s EPS group chairman Tim Wilson.

“We hope that the insights provided by our survey encourages councils to create and promote more EPS collection centres to establish a steady supply of this material, so it can be recycled and reused.”

The BPF has this year launched an EPS recyclers’ map, listing facilities across the country where people can take this packaging material.

The online survey included 2,059 people between 28-29 January.

Nottinghamshire man fined £4.5k for burning waste

A man from the village of Burton Joyce has been ordered to pay over £8,000 after repeatedly allowing construction waste to be burned on his property.

Nottingham Magistrates Court heard that the man had let subcontractors burn the waste at the site on Henry Road in Beeston despite a legal notice from the council to stop.

Councillor Helen Skinner, holder of the Broxtowe Borough Council’s climate change portfolio, said the case sends out a clear message that burning trade waste is unacceptable.

“The Council has worked hard to achieve huge improvements in air quality across Broxtowe over the last decade, and we’ve seen air pollution reduce by nearly 40% during this time,” she said.

The man, unnamed by the council’s report, was ordered to pay fines totalling £4,500, council costs of £2,005 and a victim surcharge of £1,300.

Argyll & Bute save £3m on transfer station

Plans for a waste transfer station in the Scottish highland town of Helensburgh have been rejected as poor value for money.

The Argyll & Bute unitary authority said the £3m saving would be used to address cost pressures in local waste services.

A review of the project found it was not the most cost-efficient way to provide disposal compliant with Scotland’s ban on biodegradable municipal waste going to landfill.

“We need to adapt when circumstances and new opportunities present [themselves],” said councillor John Armour. “Our duty is to manage public money prudently, and at the moment this money can be better used on other waste projects.”

After the authority’s proposed off-taker withdrew from the market, it chose to continue with current third-party arrangements.

NGB Clean launches bicycle recycling scheme

Social enterprise NGB Clean will work with waste management firm Velorim to collect and recycle bicycle tyres and inner tubes.

The cleaning organisation, which works with ex-offenders, launched the ‘Ride, Recycle, Repeat’ initiative at the Farringdon headquarters of LinkedIn last week (12 March).

NGB Clean will place recycling bins at bike stores across London after learning that discarded inner tubes and tyres were being thrown out with general waste.

“Given that most medium to large buildings across London have bike stores and a large number of cyclists, NGB Clean believes it can make a huge impact,” said chief operating officer Sam Worden.

""We are not driving this project with an expectation to make a profit but instead create something that will raise awareness and reduce waste going to landfill, and by utilising our access to property management companies we can really make a difference”.

The collected materials will be recycled at Velorim’s Staffordshire facility where they will be processed for use in non-slip flooring, cycle paths and construction materials.

Scotland consults over landfill fund

The Scottish Government has launched a consultation into the future of the Scottish Landfill Communities Fund (SLCF).

Declining tax revenues mean that continuation of the fund, which delivers money to community projects, will soon be unsustainable in its current format, explained the consultation paper.

With waste sent to landfill in Scotland having halved since 2015, contributions to the SLCF are expected to fall to £1.4m a year, meaning administration costs will exceed legally mandated levels by 2026/27.

Respondents have until 6 June to comment on potential changes that might make continuation of the fund possible.

Launders Lane case reaches high court

Residents’ group, Clear the Air in Havering, will have its day in court this week as its case against the borough council continues.

Illegal waste deposits at the Launders Lane site in Rainham routinely catch fire, with residents complaining the site has been burning for 20 years.

The group is challenging Havering Council’s July 2024 decision not to designate the illegal landfill site at Launders Lane, Rainham, as ‘contaminated’. This desgination would oblige the authority to ensure its clean up.

Legal firm Doughty Street Chambers, which will represent the group in court, said members were concerned about the council’s inaction.

“Residents are concerned that exposure to air pollution from the site can damage airways, aggravate lung diseases, cause asthma attacks, and increase other health risks,” read a statement from the legal firm.

MYGroup joins British Beauty Council

Yorkshire-based recycling company MYGroup says it has become the first waste management firm to become a patron of the British Beauty Council (BBCo).

Having worked on recycling schemes with many council members, including Boots, Estee Lauder and Superdrugs, the company claims that joining the BBCo will provide further opportunities to improve the industry’s sustainability.

“This is a natural next step for our leadership in the cosmetics recycling space and building on our industry collaborations, setting the standard for others to follow,” said group director Steve Carrie.

MyGroups ‘Recycle at Boots’ scheme already allows beauty and cosmetics items, previously considered ‘unrecyclable’, to be saved from residual streams.

Recycling rainbow at St Patrick’s festival

Campaign group Every Can Counts (ECC) has created a giant rainbow installation using over 1,500 recycled cans for this year's St Patrick’s Day parade.

Designed to highlight the importance of recycling, the rainbow returned for the second year, while ECC representatives were dressed head to toe in cans the colour of the Irish flag.

ECC programme manager Chris Latham-Warde said he hoped the installation inspired people to think about the benefits of recycling their beer cans.

“Aluminium is infinitely recyclable, and every empty drink can could be recycled and back on a shop shelf in as little as 60 days,” he said.

“The people of Dublin and Ireland can all play their part in this process by ensuring they recycle all of their used drink cans by returning them via the Deposit Return Scheme.”

Premier League star pushes kit donation campaign to address sportswear waste

An English Premier League football captain is helping to lead efforts to encourage fans across the country to donate old replica kits, rather than consigning then to landfill.

Ethan Ampadu of the Leeds united men’s team spoke to national broadcaster ITV about his support for a campaign to encourage old shorts and kits to be donated, rather than discarded.

Ampadu donated a signed shirt worn in his debut match for the club to highlight the Great Save campaign. The campaign is being introduced by the Green Football initiative that seeks to raise awareness among fans about addressing climate change issues.

The campaign will run from 11 March to 2 April this year to demonstrate the impact fans, clubs and their staff can have on the environment by opting to sell, donate, or reuse old football kits.

Ampadu told ITV news that there was an important environmental message behind the campaign,

He said: “There is 10,000 tonnes of sportswear that goes into landfills every year.”

“It’s not just me, but if everyone can help and join in, then we can reduce those numbers.”

Biffa poll tracks UK attitudes to workplace food waste

A poll of 1,000 UK office workers has warned that the energy generation potential of significant amounts of food waste is going unrealised from being sent to landfill.

The findings, commissioned by Biffa Waste Services, concluded that an individual discarding unwanted food to general waste could charge a single phone 13 times every week by recycling it instead.

Among some of the conclusions from the research was that only one in ten of the workers surveyed thought their office was separating and sending food waste for processing at sites such as Anaerobic Digestion (AD) plants to produce biogas.

Other conclusions from the survey were that 37% of respondents were looking to purchase smaller portions of food to cut their waste. One in two of the respondents said they were throwing away a part of their lunch at workplaces on a weekly basis.

The survey looked at some of the attitudes towards those disposing food waste in offices.

A majority - 45% of respondents – said they were discarding inedible food such as banana skins or eggshells at their place of work. Meanwhile, 30% of the survey group that discarded food waste in the office did so as a result of schedules changes and time constraints. The survey found that 15% of the group discarding food waste did so as a result of overordering,

Biffa Waste Servies said that the publication of the survey was intended to coincide with the simpler recycling reforms that will initially come into effect for commercial companies from 31 March. The reforms set out new requirements for separating different materials from workplaces and businesses to aid recycling.

Maxine Mayhew, chief operating officer for collections and specialist services at Biffa, said the findings aimed to highlight how food waste was an overlooked but significant issue for workplace.

She said: “t’s essential to separate food waste, not only to reduce contamination in dry mixed recycling, but to enable us to recycle it and recover energy. Energy which can be used to charge mobile phones or boil a kettle for example.”

“The implementation of simpler recycling at the end of this month for businesses with ten or more full-time employees is a crucial step forward in managing waste more consistently and reducing confusion, whilst protecting the environment.""

Researchers analyse incinerator bottom ash

A statistical analysis of the precious metals found in incinerator bottom ash (IBA) has looked at the potential investment levels in a plant to better ensure profitable recovery of different materials.

The results, published in Nature, found that silver content was the most commonly found metal found in IBA, at levels more than 22 times that of gold and 525 times that of platinum. Another aim for the research was to look at the important of ensuring effective recovery levels.

“The average values of precious metals in the analyzed samples are many times higher than the values of these elements in the Earth’s crust,” read the study, by academics from the University of Krakow.

The analysis noted that profitability thresholds might be better met if non-precious metals were also recovered.

First deliveries received at Skelton Grange EfW site

The Skelton Grange energy from waste (EfW) facility in Leeds has received its first delivery of waste as the site operator moves towards full operation this year.

An estimated 200 tonnes of unrecyclable waste supplied by six different sources has been received this week by plant operator enfinium.

The company described the delivery as an important step in moving to full operations at the site, which is expected to divert 410,000 tonnes of unrecyclable waste from landfill annually. This will create an annual energy generation capacity of 49MW that is expected to help power 100,000 homes in the UK, the operator added.

More than 400 jobs are expected to be created during the plant’s construction, with 40 full-time roles planned for the operation of the facility itself, according to enfinium.

The Skelton Grange facility will supply waste heat for the Aire Valley Heat and Power Network. The project, which was recently the recipient of £19.5m from the Government’s Green Heat Network Fund incentive.

Dan James, the plant manager for the Skelton Grange, said the delivery was an important step towards the completion of the site.

He said: “Energy from waste facilities play an incredibly important role in contributing to a circular economy and reducing emissions from the waste sector by diverting our unrecyclable waste from landfill. Our Skelton Grange facility in Leeds is a high-spec, energy efficient site that will transform our unrecyclable waste into electricity to power local homes and businesses for decades to come.”

UK consumer survey mulls packaging recyclability attitudes

A survey of 750 adults has found just under three quarters of respondents want retailers and brands to do more to reduce plastic packaging waste.

The new findings have been commissioned by Aquapak found that 65% of respondents could be doing more to reduce plastics, while 18% said that enough was being done.

Other conclusions of the research conducted by Consumer Intelligence last month found that 59% of the survey group wished to see more action on replacing conventional plastic with alternate materials that can be recycled and have a limited environmental impact.

The findings said that 57% of the group should use more paper-based packaging that was suitable for kerbside collection.

EA grants permit for Portland incinerator

The Environment Agency (EA) has granted Powerfuel Portland a permit to develop an energy-from-waste (EfW) plant on the isle of Portland.

Local authorities and campaigners have opposed plans for the 183,000-tonne-a-year plant, with the latest attempts to pause the project rebuffed by ministers last month.

The EA said said it had considered all submissions received during previous consultations.

“Where an application meets the requirements of the Environmental Permitting Regulations (2016) the agency must issue a permit,” said the regulator.

The plans are still scheduled for statutory review in the High Court this month after the Stop Portland Waste Incinerator campaign filed a legal challenge against the project last year.

Harrow to spend £348,000 on fly-tip

Councillors for the London Borough of Harrow have engaged in heated debate after the costs of cleaning up an illegal dump site were revealed.

The council-owned former car-park is earmarked for a housing development but will cost £348,000 to clear after 18 months’ worth of fly-tipping, said councillors.

Opposition Labour member David Perry reportedly told councillors that the pond on the site was likely to now be contaminated, as the council was accused of failing to secure the area.

Conservative leader Paul Osborn said there was a limit to what the council could do when faced with activity on an ‘industrial scale’ with criminals having forced entry to the site.

Notably, these technologies were presented as part of a new concept for a hydrogen aircraft powered by four 2-megawatt electric engines. Each engine is powered by a fuel cell system, with the four FC systems drawing liquid hydrogen from two tanks. This concept is to be further refined in the coming years.

At the beginning of last year, Airbus announced the completion of its first 1.2-megawatt hydrogen fuel cell system for a planned concept aircraft. This was intended to be ready for commercial flight by 2035, with the first test flight planned for 2026. This date now has been officially shifted to “the second half of the 2030s.” In addition, Airbus wrote: “Integrated ground testing is planned for 2027 at the Electric Aircraft System Test House in Munich, combining the propulsive bench and hydrogen distribution system for comprehensive system validation.”

Airbus Head of the ZEROe Project, Glenn Llewellyn explained how the development process has been going: “Over the last five years, we have explored multiple hydrogen-propulsion concepts, before down-selecting this fully electric concept. We are confident it could provide the necessary power density for a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft and could evolve as we mature the technology.” He further explained that Airbus intends to concentrate on advancing the storage, distribution and propulsion systems in the next years, while also advocating for the regulatory framework to ensure that these aircraft can take to the air.

“Hydrogen is at the heart of our commitment to decarbonise aviation. While we’ve adjusted our roadmap, our dedication to hydrogen-powered flight is unwavering,” explained Airbus Head of Future Programmes, Bruno Fichefeux, adding: “Just as we saw in the automotive sector, fully electric aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells have the potential in the longer term to revolutionise air transport for the better, complementing the sustainable aviation fuel pathway.”

Last month, Airbus had not only announced the delay of its hydrogen aviation project, but also paused its air taxi development project. This project focused on smaller, battery-electric aircraft which would ferry passengers, which is an area where several startups have recently gone bankrupt, including Lilium and Volocopter, which was recently purchased by Diamond Aircraft. On the other hand, in China, Ehang, JAC Motors and Guoxian just launched an eVTOL joint venture, while Joby and Virgin Atlantic announced a partnership in the field.

Airbus is also involved in several projects surrounding fuel cell aviation with multiple partners, including the Hydrogen in Aviation alliance, or a 2023 project with BMW and Quantinuum to improve fuel cell catalysts, which was launched just a few months after a project with STMicroelectronics to develop power electronics.

Standardized trading tools like the GEO CP1 contract boost the trust and ease of access in carbon markets.","Xpansiv, a leading infrastructure provider for global energy transition markets, has announced the launch of its CBL GEO® CORSIA first compliance phase (GEO CP1) standardized spot contract on April 29, 2025. This contract will help the international aviation sector meet carbon offsetting needs. It supports the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

The new contract will trade on Xpansiv’s CBL spot exchange. It will also be available through partner exchanges. These include the Aviation Carbon Exchange (ACE), which CBL runs with the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The Johannesburg Stock Exchange’s JSE Ventures Carbon Market will also offer it.

This expansion is a big step in blending voluntary and compliance carbon markets. Airlines are now entering the first compliance phase of CORSIA.

The Growing Need for Carbon Credits in Aviation

The aviation industry is responsible for a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon credits are becoming more essential for airlines aiming to cut emissions. This is because alternative technologies, like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), are still costly and not fully developed.

Under CORSIA, airlines must offset emissions above 2019 levels. They do this by buying carbon credits from approved projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gases.

The demand for high-quality carbon credits will likely rise. This increase comes as more airlines and industries join compliance markets. ICAO recently projected that 100-150 million tons of CORSIA Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) will be required during the first compliance phase.

RELATED: CORSIA Credits Soaring Costs: How They Are Reshaping Aviation’s Future

Xpansiv’s new GEO CP1 contract aligns with this growing demand, as remarked by John Melby, Xpansiv CEO:

“The transition into the compliance phase of CORSIA is a watershed moment for the rapidly converging voluntary and compliance carbon markets. Our new GEO CP1 contract has been carefully designed based on an extensive market consultation, which revealed a clear consensus to launch the contract only when deliverable supply was available and sufficient clarity around the ICAO framework was achieved. Those conditions have now been met.”

Standardized Trading and Market Transparency

One of the key features of the GEO CP1 contract is its alignment with CORSIA EEU eligibility criteria. When launched, EEUs from this contract will be sourced from top environmental credit registries. These include:

ART TREES,

ACR,

Climate Action Reserve,

Gold Standard, and

Verra.

When more registries get CORSIA approval, their credits can be used in the contract, too.

Xpansiv is using its strong market infrastructure to boost transparency and efficiency in trading. A unique sub-account structure developed for IATA’s recent EEU procurement events will also be available for GEO CP1 participants. This setup allows traders to trade the contract without needing main accounts for each credit standard. It makes access to CORSIA-compliant credits easier.

An analysis by Abatable suggests that demand for CORSIA credits could surpass available supply by 2030. Without new projects, CORSIA demand in Phase 2 can be 14x bigger than the supply.

Market Growth and the Role of Carbon Credits

The launch of the GEO CP1 contract comes at a time when the carbon market is experiencing rapid growth. In 2023, global carbon market revenues reached a record $104 billion.

Companies in aviation, energy, and manufacturing are turning to carbon credits. They use these credits to meet sustainability goals and follow regulations.

Regulatory frameworks like the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) are boosting the demand for verified carbon offsets. Also, consumer demand and investor interest in sustainability have pushed companies to join carbon markets. As a result, investment firms and financial institutions are integrating carbon offset projects into their portfolios.

Even with this growth, the carbon market has struggled with price swings and unclear regulations. In 2024, carbon credit prices dropped due to shifts in global climate policies.

The global average carbon price stood at $32 per ton of CO₂, falling short of the estimated $50 per ton needed by 2030 to achieve Paris Agreement targets. Localized markets like California’s cap-and-trade system saw carbon prices hit $42 per metric ton in 2024. They are expected to rise to $46 per ton in 2025.

Xpansiv’s Performance in the Carbon Market

Xpansiv has seen significant growth in its trading volumes, particularly on its CBL platform. In November 2024, trading volumes almost doubled. This surge was fueled by Nature-Based Global Emission Offsets (N-GEOs). More than 600,000 tons were traded at prices between $0.30 and $4.10 per metric ton.

SEE MORE: Voluntary Carbon Market Growth: Nature-Based Credits Double Xpansiv CBL Trading Volume

By mid-December 2024, over 2 million tons of carbon credits were traded on the platform. This made up 16% of all transactions for the year.

In January 2025, Xpansiv’s CBL spot exchange made headlines. It recorded over $27 million in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) transactions. This amounted to a total of 251,758 MWh.

These market trends show the increasing reliance on Xpansiv’s infrastructure for carbon trading and emissions management.

The Future of Carbon Markets and CORSIA Compliance

Looking ahead, Xpansiv is well-positioned to support the expansion of carbon markets. As companies and governments push for net-zero goals, the need for quality carbon credits will grow. Standardized trading tools like the GEO CP1 contract boost the trust and ease of access in carbon markets.

Government policies will also play a crucial role in shaping the future of carbon markets. Initiatives like carbon pricing, cap-and-trade, and carbon taxes will likely affect credit demand. Also, new tech like blockchain for credit tracking will boost market transparency. This helps stop problems like double counting.

by Tim Hepher and Joanna Plucinska (Reuters) The head of global airlines body IATA has welcomed a call by Europe's top carriers for a delay to a 2030 target for sustainable aviation fuel use in Europe, saying Brussels policymakers need to face reality.

""We can't just stand back and pretend that these targets are meaningful and can be achieved. They were never going to be capable of being achieved,"" Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association, told Reuters.

Under European Union rules, suppliers must ensure that 2% of fuel available at EU airports is SAF in 2025, rising to 6% in 2030 and gradually to 70% in 2050.

Airlines say SAF is barely available and that they are being blamed for shortfalls in availability from the energy industry, while insisting they remain committed to a broader industry goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.

""There's fantastic ambition, but you can only achieve it if everybody plays their part and others aren't playing their part,"" Walsh said on the sidelines of an annual event hosted by the A4E European airline association.

European airline leaders earlier issued their bluntest warning yet that the near-term EU fuel mandates, which IATA has opposed, were beyond reach and urged the new European Commission to focus on the sector's competitiveness. READ MORE

Clean Jet Fuel Production Lagging Behind 2030 Goals (OilPrice.com)

Green jet fuel production could miss 2030 targets, BCG report says (Reuters)

Excerpt from OilPrice.com: The ramp-up of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has been slower than expected due to high costs and economic uncertainty, putting global clean jet fuel supply off course to reach the 2030 targets, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Airlines and airports globally invest just 1-3% of their revenues or capex on SAF, per the report cited by Reuters.

High production costs remain the key barriers to faster adoption of SAF, according to BCG’s findings.

“Despite continuing to scale the availability of sustainable aviation fuel, and we see that trend very clearly, there is a slowdown in the development of projects and even bigger gaps to some of the commitments that some of the companies have made,” said BCG Managing Director and Partner Pelayo Losada, who co-authored the report.

Last year, for example, Shell paused on-site construction work at a biofuels plant in Rotterdam amid weak market conditions. The plant is designed to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel made from waste.

Among the experts was Amy Carico, director of fuel services and technical standards at Airlines for America (A4A), whose presentation ""SAF 101 - Introduction to Alternative Jet Fuels and Their Handling"" provided an overview of this growing industry. A4A contributed these responses to GSW questions.

GSW: What does the term ""SAF"" really mean?

A4A: Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is one of the many terms describing liquid aviation fuel that emits less carbon on a lifecycle basis than traditional, petroleum-based aviation fuel, while satisfying other relevant sustainability criteria and still meeting the rigorous specifications required to ensure safety of flight.

SAF can be produced from a variety of feedstocks that are coupled with production pathways that use different fuel-processing technologies. Depending on the feedstocks and production pathway, today’s SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by around 60-80% when compared to conventional jet fuel, with 100% reduction possible in the future.

Jet fuel has always been a complex mixture of hundreds of unique molecules, and each batch is unique, based on the crude slate and refinery processing. Sustainable Aviation Fuel meets the same technical and safety standards as conventional jet fuel. To be used in aircraft today, SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel.

GSW: What is SAF made of?

A4A: SAF can be produced from a number of different feedstocks including oils and fats, oil seed crops, woody wastes, municipal solid waste, CO2 and water.

All SAF that is used in aircraft today is a mixture of a synthetic blend component (SBC) and petroleum-based fuel. SBC, often referred to as neat SAF (not yet blended with conventional jet), is the industry-accepted technical term referring to a finished product meeting one of the ASTM D7566 annexes.

Prior to blending, SBC or neat SAF is not yet approved as a finished fuel and cannot be used in aircraft. It must be blended with conventional jet fuel prior to testing/certification as ASTM D1655 compliant jet fuel.

A mixture of SBC (or neat SAF) with conventional jet fuel creates Semi-Synthetic Aviation Turbine Fuel (SSATF) or Semi-Synthetic Jet Fuel (SSJF). After the SSJF has received one of

several sustainability certifications, it is then deemed and qualified as SAF. These are the industry-accepted technical terms.

Only SSATFs or SAFs that are already blended can be approved as finished fuels, and then be used in aircraft just like any other jet fuel.

GSW: Is there such a thing as fully synthetic aviation fuel?

A4A: Fully synthetic aviation turbine fuel (FSATF) is the industry-accepted technical term for a finished fuel that is made wholly of synthetic components (no conventional jet fuel). These are also commonly referred to as “100% SAF” and have been used on a number of demonstration flights conducted by airlines and OEMs. Because there is not yet an approved ASTM standard for these fuels, they have not yet been used on commercial flights.

FSATFs may contain fuel produced using only a single method of production or may be multiple approved D7566 annexes/production processes blended with each other. FSATFs are molecularly identical to conventional jet fuel and necessarily contain aromatic molecules in order to comply with ASTM D1655.

GSW: What do SAF logistics look like?

A4A: Most SBC or SAF production facilities are not adjacent to standard refining facilities, and SBCs need to be transported to blending facilities before transport to airports.

Pipelines are the safest, most efficient, most economical way to transport liquid fuels. Almost all jet fuel moves by pipeline. Today, no pipelines move SBCs or neat SAFs - only blended SAF can go into a pipeline.

To scale the SAF industry, infrastructure investments across the supply chain are needed. For example, the majority of pre-airfield tanks are not equipped to conduct a proper blend. Expanding the locations where SAF is produced and blended can support the efficient delivery of this fuel to airports.

EI 1533 is a document, produced through collaboration of the world’s leading subject matter experts, containing quality assurance requirements for semi-synthetic jet fuel and synthetic blending components. It defines handling procedures, testing and controls for various types of transportation and equipment used for import, export and shipping of SBC or SAFs. It is the global standard for handling of SBCs and SAF, and can be downloaded here.

GSW: How should SAF be handled at airports?

A4A: SAF requires no special handling, with no special checks or equipment modifications. Once the fuel has met D1655 requirements, it is considered the same as conventional jet fuel.

GSW: What is the industry's goal for adopting SAF usage?

A4A: U.S. carriers transport over 2.6 million passengers and 61,000 tons of cargo per day while contributing just 2 percent of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions. U.S. operators are committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Expanding the availability, affordability, and usage of SAF will be essential to reach that goal. U.S. airlines have pledged to work across the aviation industry and with government leaders to make three billion gallons of cost-competitive sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) available for use in 2030. Reaching these goals will require significantly increased commercial scale production and significantly more affordable SAF.

GSW: What do you foresee for the future of SAF usage?

A4A: The SAF industry is still in its infancy. As such, because of the high cost of SAF and the limited production of this fuel, SAF quotas or mandates are not appropriate. But support for voluntary SAF deployment initiatives and incentives can help to scale the growing industry.

SAF must meet rigorous certification and environmental criteria, and there are currently very few producers of SAF, so the costs are very high while logistics for feedstocks, production, blending and delivery are still being established. Scaling this industry will require continued policy support and stakeholder engagement to ensure that SAF is both affordable for airlines and profitable for fuel producers.

U.S. airlines are committed to making SAF commercially viable to support our environmental and supply diversification goals and have engaged with fuel suppliers and other stakeholders to support the nascent industry. There is still significant work to do to scale up supply and make SAF cost competitive with conventional jet fuel.

Accordingly, U.S. airlines welcome support for efforts to make SAF fully commercially viable and deploy SAF where it makes sense as we scale up. U.S. airlines are reaching out to policymakers, renewable fuels producers, and increasingly with the agriculture industry to find ways to more rapidly scale up the availability of affordable SAF. If we are collectively successful, in addition to the environmental benefits, there benefits to be gained for fuel producers, farmers and other feedstock providers, airlines, and the traveling public, We encourage fuel producers, airports, policymakers, environmental organizations and other stakeholders to work with us in cooperative ways to develop, evaluate and support policies that will, quite literally, get SAF off the ground.","https://img.aviationpros.com/files/base/cygnus/cavc/image/2025/03/67d9a7a79bf8b42a36af0dbf-20250219_092502.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-03-28 17:56:25.172459

challenges while embracing transformative innovations. Labor shortages, capacity constraints, geopolitical tensions, and sustainability imperatives are reshaping operational strategies, while technological advancements in automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and digitalization are redefining efficiency and resilience.

This comprehensive analysis synthesizes findings from industry reports, case studies, and regulatory frameworks to provide actionable insights for stakeholders navigating this complex environment. Key themes include the urgent need for workforce upskilling, infrastructure modernization, and the integration of sustainable practices to meet evolving e-commerce demands and regulatory standards.

Labor shortages and workforce dynamics

Labor shortages remain among the most pressing challenges for air cargo operators in 2025. The scarcity of skilled personnel - exacerbated by immigration restrictions and outdated hiring practices - has led to operational delays, increased overtime costs, and heightened safety risks.

Inadequate staffing at cargo terminals has extended shipment wait times, directly impacting customer satisfaction and supply chain reliability. Overburdened employees face declining morale, creating a cyclical problem of burnout and attrition that further strains productivity.

Leading organizations are implementing reskilling programs that combine technical training with soft-skills development to address these gaps. Microlearning modules and immersive technologies like virtual reality (VR) are being deployed to simulate real-world scenarios, enabling workers to master equipment handling and safety protocols without disrupting operations.

Some airlines have adopted AI-driven predictive analytics to identify skill gaps and tailor training programs, resulting in improvements to operational efficiency. Partnerships with academic institutions complement these initiatives to create pipelines for talent in logistics management and aviation engineering.

Capacity constraints and infrastructure modernization

Air cargo terminals worldwide are operating at or near capacity, struggling to accommodate the surge in e-commerce-driven shipment volumes. At some major hubs, legacy infrastructure has led to bottlenecks in cargo processing, with average handling times increasing by more than 20% since 2023, in some cases.

Operators are investing in automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS) and AI-led sorting technologies. Deployment of caster decking and IoT-enabled smart containers are significantly reducing cargo processing times while minimizing human error.

Modernizing infrastructure extends beyond terminal upgrades. Airports increasingly integrate with road and rail networks to create seamless multi-modal logistics corridors. The Port of Oakland's Phase 2 expansion project, for example, which includes electrified cargo loaders and automated guided vehicles (AGVs), has enhanced connectivity between air, land, and warehouse operations.

However, such projects require significant capital, posing financial challenges for operators already contending with inflationary pressures.

Geopolitical tensions and supply chain resilience

Geopolitical shifts, particularly U.S.-China trade disputes and regional conflicts, have forced air cargo operators to reconfigure supply chains. Alterations in global air freight routes due to tariff uncertainties and sanctions have increased average transit times.

Forward-thinking companies are adopting agile logistics models, in some cases leveraging blockchain for real-time shipment tracking and diversifying supplier networks across Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe, reducing geopolitical risk exposure.

New trade policies, such as eliminating duty-free exemptions for low-value shipments, have complicated customs processes. Air cargo operators must now submit digital manifests 12 hours before departure, necessitating upgrades to compliance management systems.

Collaborative platforms like IATAʼs ONE Source have standardized documentation across 150 countries, reducing clearance delays. Mid-sized carriers' compliance

costs remain high, however, averaging $4.3 million annually.

Technological transformation and operational efficiency

AI is revolutionizing air cargo operations through applications in route optimization, predictive maintenance, and demand forecasting, enabling reduced fuel consumption through analysis of real-time weather data and optimized flight paths.

Similarly, predictive maintenance algorithms serve to decrease equipment downtime while extending the lifespan of critical assets like aircraft tugs and conveyor systems.

The shift from paper-based processes to digital platforms has accelerated, with most cargo handlers now using IoT sensors for real-time tracking. Blockchain technology ensures data

transparency across supply chains, enabling stakeholders to monitor environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) for sensitive shipments like pharmaceuticals.

Sustainability imperatives and regulatory pressures

Sustainability has transitioned from a voluntary initiative to a regulatory mandate. The

International Air Transport Association (IATA) mandates a 5% SAF blend for all cargo flights by 2025, driving investments in biofuel production facilities.

Major companies are committing to achieving net-zero emissions, deploying electric ground support equipment (eGSE) and solar-powered warehouses at major hubs.

Meanwhile, circular economic principles are gaining traction, particularly in recycling unit load devices (ULDs) and packaging materials.

Simultaneously, fleet modernization initiatives are replacing older aircraft with fuel efficient models, cutting CO₂ emissions per ton-mile.

Cybersecurity in a digitally dependent ecosystem

Advancements aside, the industry’s reliance on digital systems has exposed vulnerabilities to AI-driven cyberattacks. In 2024, a ransomware attack on a major European cargo handler disrupted 15% of global air freight for 72 hours, highlighting the need for robust defenses. Solutions include zero-trust architectures, which restrict access to critical systems, and AI-powered threat detection platforms which aim to reduce incident response time.

Strict data privacy laws, such as the EUʼs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), require cargo operators to encrypt sensitive customer information. IATAʼs Cybersecurity Certification Program has standardized protocols across 210 airlines, ensuring compliance while maintaining operational flexibility.

Strategic recommendations and future directions

What can be done to move air cargo handling into the next era with greater efficiency and cost effectiveness? The following areas offer ideas for a good start:

Workforce Development: Expand partnerships with technical schools and offer tuition reimbursement programs to address skill gaps.

Infrastructure Modernization: Prioritize automated systems and multi-modal hubs to alleviate capacity constraints.

Sustainability Integration: Accelerate SAF adoption through government subsidies and industry consortia.

Cybersecurity Resilience: Allocate 5% of IT budgets to AI-driven threat intelligence

systems.

Future research should focus on scaling AI applications for small-to-medium airports and

optimizing hydrogen fuel cell technologies for ground support equipment. Cross-industry

collaborations, such as the Air Cargo Tech Summit, will play a pivotal role in standardizing green technologies and sharing best practices.

The air cargo industryʼs ability to thrive in 2025 hinges on its capacity to balance operational challenges with technological innovation. By addressing labor shortages through targeted training, modernizing infrastructure, and embracing sustainability, stakeholders can build resilient supply chains capable of withstanding geopolitical and economic shocks.

As digital transformation accelerates, proactive investments in cybersecurity and AI will ensure competitiveness in an increasingly dynamic market.

Transcript

Speed by itself is a joint development between British Airways and Lanza Jet. The project itself is split in two pieces. You've got Nova Pangea producing 2G ethanol using their process and that ethanol would then be used at The Lancet facility to take ethanol into SAF. The facility itself, so the lands is yet facility is going to be in the north of England. So it's going to be the first 2G ethanol SAF production facility in the Europe. On the current plan and it has the potential depending on where we get that ethanol from to produce carbon negative S. When when we say that we have to talk about the the CIO of the of the plant from all the way through from ethanol production, which is effectively outside defense line of Lanja jet. But ethanol production all the way through to the SAF production and logistics. So we have to look at the carbon intensity of the fuel from initiation all the way through to wing tip to produce that. Calculation.

The “Book and Claim” method simplifies SAF access, especially benefiting smaller operators.

Airbus announced a pilot program running through 2025 to test a “Book and Claim” model, enabling operators to “book” SAF quantities and “claim” emission reductions—even if the fuel is used elsewhere.

Airbus will purchase SAF certificates managed by the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognized sustainability body, and resell them to aircraft and helicopter operators. This boosts immediate demand and solves logistical challenges for smaller or remote operators.

RELATED ARTICLE: Airbus and LanzaJet to Collaborate on Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production

Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, explained:

“Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market. For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to SAF can be challenging depending on the amount of SAF needed. Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and derisk the process for operators and SAF suppliers, by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them. This is also a great opportunity to demonstrate Book and Claim is reliable and that its usage should be extended in voluntary and regulatory markets.”

The first Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by SMBC Aviation Capital, followed closely by AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment, and SAF Aerogroup—highlighting broad industry support.

In its current form, HEFA is mainly reliant on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction, which has several drawbacks since HDO requires large amounts and pressures of hydrogen, feedstocks of high purity and cost, as well as problematic sulfided catalysts that risk contaminating the biofuel product with sulfur. A process based on decarboxylation/decarbonylation (deCOx) offers an attractive alternative to HDO, since it requires lower amounts and pressures of hydrogen, feedstocks of low purity and cost, and simple supported metal catalysts. Herein, several geographically distributed oleaginous feedstocks – ranging from municipal waste feeds (brown grease) to pine chemicals (tall oil and rosin) – were upgraded to RD and SAF via deCOx. Powdered and engineered Ni-based catalysts were used for FOG-to-RD conversion via deCOx, evaluating deoxygenation over reducible and non-reducible oxides.

Engineered alumina-based catalyst showed superior deoxygenation activity and stability for up to 300 hours on stream. Similarly, quantitative conversion of FOG to SAF was achieved over bifunctional Ni-Cu-based catalysts with zeolitic supports, with deCOx and isomerization occurring in a single step. Initial screening studies performed in a semi-batch reactor revealed that upgrading distilled tall oil (DTO) over a Ni-Cu-based catalyst afforded all types of hydrocarbons comprising SAF, namely n-alkanes, iso-alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatics. The same combination of feed, catalyst, and reaction conditions were applied in a fixed-bed reactor for a continuous experiment, consisting of two 72-hour cycles with catalyst regeneration in between. DTO conversion remained quantitative (~100%), with aromatic yields ≥80% regardless of time-on-stream. Most liquid products fell within the carbon number and boiling point range of jet fuel across all samples. Notably, the reaction produced all hydrocarbon classes found in SAF, with particular abundance of aromatic hydrocarbons. Since ~20% aromatics are required to swell elastomeric seals and prevent leaks in aircraft fuel systems, seal compatibility testing confirmed that the aromatics-rich SAF blendstock exhibited a volume swell percentage comparable to qualified SAF blends. Catalysts used for deoxygenation reactions were characterized using various techniques – including N2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, microscopy, and temperature-programmed methods – to rationalize trends, propose reaction pathways, and elucidate structure-activity relationships. Finally, to evaluate the economic and environmental feasibility of this technology, techno-economic and lifecycle analyses were conducted on an integrated plant combining catalytic deoxygenation and hydrothermal gasification, producing hydrogen for converting tall oil fatty acid to SAF. The analyses revealed a minimum fuel-selling price of USD$0.39/L – lower than that of existing SAF pathways (USD$1.4/L) – with greenhouse gas emissions of 5.1g CO2-eq/MJ, which is 94% lower than fossil jet fuel (85g CO2-eq/MJ).",https://chem.as.uky.edu/themes/fwrd/favicon.ico,N,,2025-03-28 18:57:22.439638

The energy gap in a superconductor is usually the same everywhere in the material.
In the 1960s, physicists wondered whether some superconducting materials could have stronger energy gaps in some areas, and weaker in others.
The modulation of the energy gap is at the scale of the space between the atoms in the material.
“The observed gap modulation represents the strongest reported so far, leading to the clearest experimental evidence to date that gap modulation can exist even at the atomic scale,” says lead author Lingyuan Kong.","Physicists have produced a superconductor which could help achieve room-temperature operations which would be useful in applications like medicine, transportation and lossless power transmission.

The new California Institute of Technology superconductor has stronger superconductivity in some areas and weaker in others.

Superconductivity is a quantum state where metals can conduct electricity with no resistance. It is already used to for powerful magnets in MRI machines.

The main drawback of superconductors is that the only materials known to achieve superconductivity require temperatures at extremely low temperatures within just a few tens of degrees above absolute zero (-273.15°C or -459.67°F.)

It costs a lot of money and energy to keep superconductors at such low temperatures. And the few superconductors which have been shown to operate at room temperature require immense pressures – another drain on dollars and power.

In normal metals, electrons move freely through a lattice of positively-charged ions made up of protons and neutrons. When the electrons bump into the ions, they lose energy. This is what physicists call resistance.

In superconductors, on the other hand, the electrons are weakly attracted to each other and bind together to form ‘Cooper pairs.’ Within small energy ranges, called energy gaps, the electrons remain paired and don’t lose energy when they collide with the ions.

The energy gap in a superconductor is usually the same everywhere in the material.

In the 1960s, physicists wondered whether some superconducting materials could have stronger energy gaps in some areas, and weaker in others.

The new Caltech research, published in Nature, has produced such modulation in flakes of an iron-based superconductor.

The modulation of the energy gap is at the scale of the space between the atoms in the material.

The researchers have named the new modulated state a Cooper-pair density modulation (PDM) state. Their modulation means the energy gap within the superconductor is up to 40% stronger in some areas.

“The observed gap modulation represents the strongest reported so far, leading to the clearest experimental evidence to date that gap modulation can exist even at the atomic scale,” says lead author Lingyuan Kong.

Kong’s team’s discovery was made possible by the first successful scanning tunnelling microscopy of an iron-based superconductor. This kind of microscopy works by moving a very sharp metal wire tip over a surface to reveal the surface’s structure at the atomic scale.",https://cosmosmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/team-finds-new-superco.jpg,N,,2025-03-28 15:56:08.540872

EU Says No - Skift,Darin Graham,,,,,https://skift.com/2025/03/28/european-airlines-push-to-delay-green-fuel-mandate-eu-says-no/,"The chief executives of four of Europe’s biggest airlines urged the EU to delay rules requiring the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) because of concerns over supply.
The EU requires all airlines operating in the region to use a proportion of SAF in its jet fuel mix.
The European Commission told Skift it rejects the calls for a delay: ""We consider the current SAF targets to be realistic and feasible,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.
Fuel Industry UK, which represents oil majors such as BP and Exxon Mobil, told Skift it believes the targets will be met.
We believe that the targets are realistic and can be met,"" a spokesperson from Fuel Industry UK said.","The chief executives of four of Europe’s biggest airlines urged the EU to delay rules requiring the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) because of concerns over supply.

The EU requires all airlines operating in the region to use a proportion of SAF in its jet fuel mix. They must currently use SAF for 2% of the fuel mix but that will ramp up to at least 6% by 2030. The UK has a similar mandate that will rise to 10% in 2030.

The European Commission told Skift it rejects the calls for a delay: ""We consider the current SAF targets to be realistic and feasible,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. “We have reaffirmed to stay the course of the European Green Deal and will therefore stick to these targets. The focus is now on their implementation, and we will offer support where needed.”

Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air France-KLM, was among the airline bosses at an aviation industry event in Brussels Thursday who spoke about the targets. “They want us to use SAF. Well show us where the SAF is. Realistically, the SAF does not exist. We don’t see it,” he said.

Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr added: “We need to cut and revise EU regulations quickly.”

Luis Gallego, CEO of British Airways owner IAG, blamed fuel producers for turning their back on greener fuels. “The oil producers say that they are not producing enough because they prefer to allocate the capital in fossil fuel or other activities,” he said.

Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary agreed and said that fuel producers told him they will not meet or have sufficient supply of SAF by 2030. “I don’t want to abandon those commitments, but I think it’s clear that the EU is going to have to move to the right,” he said. “We don't see a path toward the amount we need to reach the mandate. It needs to take the pressure off us and put it on the people who actually produce the SAF.”

SAF Supply Challenges

On the same day the airline executives spoke, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) published a report showing that fuel producers are falling behind on SAF production.

BCG surveyed over 500 aviation industry executives and found that airlines and airports are investing only 1% to 3% of their revenue into SAF. High production costs and fuel prices remain the major challenges, the report said.

Fuel Industry UK, which represents oil majors such as BP and Exxon Mobil, told Skift it believes the targets will be met.

""Fuel companies are working hard to supply their obligations to meet the targets. We believe that the targets are realistic and can be met,"" a spokesperson from Fuel Industry UK said.

‘Trump is upturning everything’

The aviation executives also warned that Europe’s sustainability targets could result in the region’s air travel industry becoming less competitive, while President Donald Trump moves towards deregulation in the United States.

“Yes we have to be net zero by 2050 but competition is where it’s going to be. Everything is going to be subject to making the industry more competitive,” said O’Leary. “Trump in the White House is upturning everything. Europe is going to have to respond to that.”

While the future of SAF is still uncertain in the United States, a report from the non-profit climate group Climate Catalyst suggested that conservative states are benefiting from green jet fuel incentives, which has led experts to believe that SAF will not be dismantled in its entirety there.

EU transport director Magda Kopczyńska previously defended the EU’s SAF policy, saying production is increasing.

""Seven years ago nobody talked about alternative fuels in aviation. What we put in place are requirements for airlines to gradually have more SAF in the fuels they use,” she said at the Destination Europe summit in February.

Speaking at European airline association A4E’s Aviation Summit on 27 March, airline leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the industry’s net-zero 2050 target, but said the interim target of 6% SAF useage by 2030 under the ReFuelEU legislation will not be met, meaning the date will need to be pushed back.
“The feedback we are getting from the oil producers is they will not have sufficient supply by 2030 to allow us to meet our 6% mandate,” says Ryanair group chief executive Michael O’Leary.

“We don’t want to abandon those commitments but I think it’s clear that they will have to move to the right.”

The airline chief executives’ claims were backed up on the day by a new report from Boston Consulting, which forecasts a shortfall of up to 45% in eSAF supply and 30% in biofuel supply by 2030.

But the European Commission immediately rejected the claims made by the A4E carriers, saying: “We consider the current SAF targets to be realistic and feasible.”

New European Commissioner for Transport Apostolos Tzitzikostas had spoken at the Brussels event and received a broadly positive response from A4E members for his willingness to work with the airline industry, although he did not directly address the prospect of a SAF shortfall.

As against the global production of 2 million tonnes of SAF in 2024, India is estimated to have the potential to produce 8-10 million tonnes of SAF annually. Just think of how farmers in Punjab and Haryana, who have been burning stubbles and polluting the air, become stakeholders in SAF production.

“You can use this feedstock (for SAF) and also control pollution,” said Gabrielle Walker, co-founder of CUR8, a leading market-maker on carbon removals.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO, LanzaJet, a sustainable aviation fuel producer and alternative fuels technology company, spoke about how there was high interest in building a self-production facility and how his company is working with India on this.

LanzaJet is reportedly negotiating with Indian Oil Corporation for a joint venture to build an SAF plant in India.

Julie Kitcher, Chief Sustainability Officer at Airbus, said that what is happening in India and China in terms of sustainable fuel should not be underestimated.

“We are going from jet fuel to SAF. There is a unique opportunity for India to contribute to the growth of aviation and decarbonisation,” Faury told ThePrint. Airbus has been in touch with SAF stakeholders in India.

“We want to play catalyst to help grow the SAF ecosystem in volumes and also on manufacturers, regulators, airlines to pool the use of SAF. That’s a collaborative effort that needs to be done. India has a lot of potential for SAF and we are hoping that India will be showing the way and leading on the growth of SAF,” said Faury.

Airbus’ India strategy

But the discussions on SAF potential are only a small part of why Airbus, Europe’s biggest aerospace company, is betting so much on India.

Its CEO is expecting procurement of components and services from India to grow by about 50 percent in the next five years: from $1.4 billion today to $2 billion by 2030. That means a four-fold increase in Airbus’ procurement spending in India in a decade, up from $500 million in 2019.

It’s not just about the sourcing volumes, though.

The French company is now sourcing complex components from India, such as A320neo cargo doors (Tata), A320/A330 flap track beams (Dynamatic) and A220 doors (Dynamatic). In the last four years, the number of engineers hired by Airbus in India has more than trebled, from 1,000 in 2021 to over 3,500 today.

“India is not only a market for aviation. It’s also supplying to the world, to Airbus—many parts, systems, equipment, and that’s growing very fast. India is very strong in software, in equipment manufacturing, IT and engineering. That’s where there is really appetite from outside to collaborate,” the Airbus CEO told ThePrint.

Explaining the importance of India in the Airbus’ scheme of things, company officials said they don’t see India as a market only. The company is developing a holistic aviation and aerospace ecosystem in India across all dimensions—assembly, manufacturing, engineering, innovation, digital, training, education, maintenance and leasing, they said.

Airbus has already set up two final assembly lines in India, for C295 aircraft and H125 choppers. It has also started two pilot training centres with a capacity of 14 full flight simulators in India.

It is also partnering with the IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology) and Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya, with Tata Strive for academic curricula, developing R&D centres, creating Aerospace Chairs at universities, investing into skill centres and offering scholarships.

‘Make in India’, ‘Design in India’, ‘Innovate in India’ and ‘Train in India’ is said to be the guiding Indian strategy for Airbus, which has built its South Asia headquarters and a pilot training centre in New Delhi. It has also announced a joint venture with the Tata Group to set up a second pilot training centre in Gurgaon, which will have 10 simulators.

Faury said Indian companies were scouting in Europe, looking at potential targets for M&A and trying to extend their footprint. There are opportunities in Europe.

“Therefore, I like the idea of the best Indian players going from India to the world. That’s what we see and we are encouraging. I am putting them in touch with the chairman of GIFAS, French aerospace and defence association… I have put some of them in touch with GIFAS in charge of SMEs,” said Faury.

The Airbus CEO, as head of GFAS, had visited India last October.

“We had 60 companies joining and creating contacts in India with Indian partners, suppliers, customers. India in integrating itself in the global aerospace industry,” said Faury.

""Hydrogen is at the heart of our commitment to decarbonize aviation,"" Airbus Head of Future Programmes Bruno Fichefeux.","Airbus has lifted the curtain just a tad and given us a glimpse at the future of commercial aviation. At the Airbus Summit 2025 in Toulouse, the company presented a view of the technology that will create the single-aisle airliner of tomorrow.

Pinning down what the airlines of the next decade will look like is both very easy and nearly impossible at the same time.

With over a century and a quarter of development behind us, aerospace science and technology are pretty well established, as is the basic idea of what a commercial airliner looks like. It hasn't changed very much at all since the introduction of the jet engine in the 1950s.

On the other hand, aeronautics is far from a done deal. There's still a lot of room for technology to benefit from new tools, materials, and ideas. While the airliner of the 2030s might still look like the boring old cylinder-and-wings template that appeared in the 1930s, it can still benefit from remarkable innovations.

The problem for the predictors is that what these innovations will be is far from certain and how these innovations interact with things like the marketplace, regulations, and the infrastructure that supports the air industry makes predictions so difficult that if I could do so with any certainty, I'd be down the casino making a fortune playing Baccarat.

That being said, Airbus gave the public a glimpse of the future single-aisle passenger plane based on what the company is developing through its various projects. The presentation was frustratingly short on details, but it did provide some insights into what may be coming as well as clarification of Airbus's decision to slow-walk its hydrogen-powered airliner.

According to the company, the next generation of Airbus airliners will feature wings that mimic those of birds, making them lighter, thinner and longer. Based on work done at Airbus's Wing Technology Development Centre at Filton, England, which is home to the Wing of Tomorrow (WoT) research and technology program, the new wings will produce more lift for less drag. To offset these extra-long wings, they will be foldable, so the new planes will be able to use existing airport gates.

Another innovation is a new jet engine that Airbus is working on. The Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) open fan engine demonstrator replaces the present turbofan and cowling of modern jet engines with an open turbofan that is larger and sits out in the open. This is claimed to reduce fuel consumption by 20% compared to present engines and will be able to run on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) at blends of up to 100%.

Along with new engines, Airbus wants to introduce hybridization, with lithium-ion or solid-state batteries and high voltage systems being used not only for propulsion, but as a way to run onboard functions like the air conditioning system or lighting, which would also reduce fuel consumption.

Another area is materials. Airbus wants to move away from Carbon-Fibrer Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) in favor of Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Thermoplastic Polymer Composites (CFRTP). This new material is an improvement of CFRPs because it can be reshaped and reprocessed after forming, can be manufactured faster, has higher impact resistance, is recyclable and remoldable, and has lower processing costs.

The future airliner will also move more into the digital realm with systems that are highly connected and automated, with the ability to instantly update itself and with increased data processing speeds. In addition, new automatic assistance systems will make flying safer and help pilots to handle complex tasks with less distraction.

But why isn't the future Airbus airliner running on hydrogen? At the Summit, Airbus explained that it ran the numbers and found that, while it could build a successful hydrogen airliner, the plane would be successful in the same way that Concorde was successful. In other words, a technological triumph, but a commercial failure.

The market simply isn't ready for hydrogen planes. The regulatory framework isn't there, nor is the hydrogen economy to provide the green or gold hydrogen fuel, so while the new iteration of the 100-seat, 1,000-nm-range (1,150 miles, 1,850 km) ZEROe hydrogen liner is more advanced, with six engines instead of four, it will remain in development for now.

""Hydrogen is at the heart of our commitment to decarbonize aviation,"" Airbus Head of Future Programmes Bruno Fichefeux.

Today, Airbus engineers are actively developing innovative solutions that promise to revolutionise the future of aviation. How exactly?

Imagine a new Airbus single-aisle aircraft with wings designed with advanced aerodynamics and biomimicry in mind to generate significantly more lift, reducing fuel consumption and increasing efficiency. Its engines will consume 20% less fuel than current models, making air travel more decarbonised and cost-effective. To further support the fuel gains made with engine improvements, Airbus anticipates a growing role for hybridisation and electrification technologies.

And don’t forget materials: the aircraft will be built with materials that are lighter yet stronger, allowing for aircraft that are both more durable and easier to handle. Furthermore, Airbus is adopting a holistic approach to integrating a novel system platform that will include smart automation not only within the aircraft but also in ground operations and maintenance.

These innovations will transform how aircraft are built, operated, and maintained, setting the stage for a new era. But what are the details of these revolutionary changes that are in store?

Taking flight like a bird

Aircraft wings have evolved significantly in both design and functionality since the early days of flight. The first wings were simple, flat and straight, relying on basic aerodynamics to achieve lift and made of basic materials like wood. As engineering progressed over the years, wings became more streamlined and curved, optimising lift and reducing drag for better performance.

Compared to where they began, today’s aircraft wings may seem to be at the apex of innovation. But Airbus believes there is still a world of possibilities for improving wing design. In 2023, the company opened the Wing Technology Development Centre at its Filton site in the UK. It is home to the Wing of Tomorrow (WoT) research and technology programme, which is heavily involved in the design of the wing for the future next generation of aircraft. But the programme goes beyond design, targeting improvements in new wing manufacturing and assembly technologies.

While technical details are being kept tightly under wraps, some of the possibilities for a new wing have already been publicly disclosed, with the most prominent being a folding wing. This gives the aircraft a longer wingspan in flight, increasing lift and reducing drag, while still making it compatible with airport gates.

Powering a more energy-efficient aircraft

Similar to wings, the aviation industry has progressed through various models of engines over the decades, steadily improving the fuel efficiency, performance and safety of the propulsion system. While the piston engines of early aircraft provided the necessary thrust to get off the ground, they were limited in efficiency and speed. The turbojet engine, first introduced in the 1950s, changed aviation forever and permitted it to spread around the globe. Today’s turbofan engine offers improved fuel efficiency and less noise, which has led to it becoming the standard in modern commercial aviation.

To take things to the next level, Airbus is investigating the potential of a few promising engines technologies. One primary contender is the open fan. An open fan engine looks quite different from a modern turbofan, as the fan blades that generate thrust are larger and not contained by a nacelle, the cowling that contains the fan in current-generation engines. This allows air to move efficiently through the engine, reducing fuel consumption.

Airbus is working with propulsion experts CFM on the Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) open fan engine demonstrator, which aims to show how this technology could reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by 20% compared to today’s most efficient single-aisle engines. Airbus plans to flight test RISE on its A380 flight test aircraft by the end of the decade.

Electrification and hybridisation improvements

Hybridisation means combining different energy sources instead of relying solely on jet fuel. This comes in a few different forms. First and foremost, the next generation of Airbus aircraft will be able to fly with a blend of up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). As SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel, this compatibility standard will be a key lever in helping airlines reach their decarbonisation target.

But SAF is not the only way to reduce emissions. Airbus is also working on advancing hybrid-electric propulsion, which supplements the use of conventional jet fuel or SAF with electricity from batteries or fuel cells. This has the potential to reduce an aircraft’s carbon emissions by up to 5%. Much like hybrid automobiles, electric hybridisation can reduce fuel consumption by using otherwise wasted energy to power non-propulsive functions.

The EcoPulse demonstrator, a joint project between Airbus, Daher and Safran, gave significant insight into the use of lithium-ion batteries onboard an aircraft with a high-voltage network. Airbus is also exploring the potential of solid-state batteries, which could provide an optimal balance of energy and power output for the next generation of aircraft. These batteries could be used to power the aircraft while taxiing on the ground, as well as during flight for onboard functions like the air conditioning system or lighting.

Exploring new materials for increased efficiency

Just like the wings and propulsion system, the materials used to build aircraft have evolved significantly since the Wright Flyer’s wooden airframe took its first flight with cotton muslin wings. Wood was replaced by aluminium within the first few decades of flight, which in turn began to be replaced by carbon-fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) in the 1980s, as its superior strength and lighter weight improved fuel efficiency. Titanium has also come to play a key role in modern aircraft, as it is strong enough to be used for high-stress aircraft components but weighs less than steel.

Overall, materials have shifted from being weaker and heavier to now being high-strength and lightweight. This has led to improvements in safety, fuel efficiency and aircraft performance. But Airbus believes there is more progress to be made. One key pathway for improvement is researching how biomass composites and thermoplastics could replace CFRP, and the progress being targeted is not limited to weight reduction. Airbus is also seeking to make the aircraft manufacturing process both more sustainable – by choosing materials that are more easily recyclable – and to make it more efficient, with less waste and quicker assembly.

An example of these kinds of improvements is the Multifunctional Fuselage Demonstrator (MFFD), an Airbus-led programme under Clean Sky 2’s Large Aircraft platform. Using carbon fibre-reinforced thermoplastic polymer composites (CFRTP) instead of CFRP, the demonstrator achieved its weight-saving target at a neutral cost and also proved greater manufacturing efficiency. The CFRTP is also easier to reuse and recycle than other materials.

The evolution of aircraft systems

Airbus disrupted the commercial aircraft market in the 1980s when it introduced fly-by-wire technology on the A320. By replacing mechanical controls with digital ones, the aircraft’s safety, manoeuvrability and reliability was improved. Soon adopted by the entire industry, fly-by-wire defines the fourth generation of aircraft flying today.

While fly-by-wire is now the industry standard, it is not the end of the road. Airbus is designing a common digital platform for a future next-generation single aisle, which will ensure safer and more efficient operations. These future systems will be highly connected and automated, powered by advanced computer platforms. These will permit automatic installation, updates and modifications of system applications, allowing for immediate improvements to enhance performance. At the same time, increased processing speeds supported by AI will increase the amount of data that can be securely processed. This will facilitate predictive maintenance and enhance passenger experience through the availability of real-time information.

Safety, the highest priority of Airbus, will also be further strengthened through increasingly automatic assistance technologies for pilots, helping them navigate complex operations with greater precision. This automatic assistance will also be expanded outside the cockpit, to ground operations and maintenance.",https://www.aero-mag.com/image-assets/d1eb512da94d8db3fe8ed11fd6b8bf01.jpg,N,,2025-03-28 13:57:00.163730

Ground tests are due to start in the third quarter of this year, with flight tests following in 2027.","Airbus is taking a down-to-earth approach for its latest study into aviation’s non-CO2 impacts, unveiling plans to replicate the conditions found at cruise altitudes and generate contrails at ground level.

Running until June 2028, the EU-funded project, called PACIFIC, sees Airbus head a consortium that includes engine supplier Rolls-Royce, German aerospace research centre DLR, fuel supplier Neste, and universities in Finland, Germany and the UK.

PACIFIC is designed to improve modelling and prediction capabilities to better assess contrail formation.

Typically found in the upper troposphere at altitudes of 32,000-42,000ft, contrails are increasingly considered to have a warming effect on the atmosphere that is more short-lived, but potentially greater than, that of CO2.

Recent studies – including the Airbus-backed VOLCAN and ECLIF3 projects – have suggested that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) can cut contrail production by up to 25% due to lower emissions of soot particles.

While more data is needed to validate those potential benefits researchers face a challenge to replicate the results obtained through flight testing.

“The repeatability and predictability are not there,” said Mark Bentall, Airbus head of research and technology programmes, speaking during the manufacturer’s Summit event in Toulouse on 25 March.

The accuracy of weather forecasts is a particular problem, with contrails only forming in ice super-saturated regions.

“It is very difficult to predict the weather. We have to schedule multiple aircraft, and then we don’t produce contrails and then we go home,” he says.

Airbus and its partners in the three-year study will assess how the composition of different fuels and the combustion process affects soot emissions and contrail formation.

“You can easily measure emissions on the ground – it is much easier than in flight – but it is harder to replicate the temperature, pressure and humidity conditions you find at altitude,” says Thomas Viguier, Airbus innovation and technology specialist.

To do that, Airbus will use a cold chamber – described by Bentall, half-jokingly, as a “big fridge” – supplied by project partner the University of Helsinki.

This will be located to the rear of one Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine on an A350 test aircraft and will cool the exhaust stream and “set the conditions so the water vapour emitted will freeze and generate ice crystals”, says Viguier.

“To actually create a contrail on the ground is something we have not done before,” adds Bentall, who hopes this will create a “repeatable test”.

Before it can begin tests with the ‘big fridge’, though, the project will need to select the exact fuels to test.

Starting with 10 different fuels, including Jet A-1, the team will run a series of combustion tests, both in the laboratory and on test rigs, to evaluate the soot particles produced by each and how different engine power levels affect that.

It will then select three fuels to take forward to the ground-test phase, examining how different fuel compositions and engine settings influence contrail formation and properties.

Separately, Airbus is to collaborate with major Canadian aerospace academic and research organisations to measure non-CO2 emissions from different fuel types.

Called CRYSTAL, the project includes ground- and flight-test campaigns at the airframer’s Mirabel site in Quebec using a Pratt & Whitney PW1500G-powered A220 test aircraft.

""Advertising a company or its products with an alleged climate neutrality can have a significant impact on purchase decisions,"" DUH quoted from the judgement.","NGO Environmental Action Germany (DUH) has won separate greenwashing lawsuits against airline Lufthansa and apparel company Adidas on the grounds of misleading consumers with sustainability claims.

In the case against Lufthansa, the regional court in Cologne found that consumers choosing the ""offset flight"" option were left in the dark as to the extent of the airline's climate compensation and in relation to the specifically booked flight. Additionally, it remained unclear what exactly was to be offset and to what extent, and that the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) gave the impression that their contribution relates to their flight.

""The court confirms our criticism and addresses how one of the world's largest airlines systematically deceives customers and pretends that air travel is climate-neutral in exchange for additional fees,"" said DUH head Jürgen Resch.

The company supplied a batch of SAF to Safran, the world's second-largest aircraft equipment manufacturer, to evaluate the specific properties of Global Bioenergies' SAF, used in its neat form, during the fuel injection phase prior to combustion in the engine. This phase is crucial to ensure, among other things, high efficiency and therefore lower fuel consumption. A test campaign was carried out near Rouen at CERTAM (regional innovation center of technological exchange in aerothermal and engines).

Frédéric Ollivier, CTO at Global Bioenergies, says:” The various simulations carried out by the CERTAM demonstrator have enabled us to test the behavior of our fuel under various conditions representative of an aircraft engine. Injecting Global Bioenergies’ SAF, without blending it with kerosene, produces a spray of fine, homogeneous droplets, very similar to the spray from Jet A-1, the standard fossil kerosene. These tests are feeding into the data that enable a better match between engine and fuel.”

ONERA, the French aerospace research center, has also carried out tests on a laboratory burner to quantify the particles emitted during combustion of Global Bioenergies' SAF.

Emission levels were measured using neat SAF from Global Bioenergies, Jet A-1 as a control, and a blend of 50% SAF and 50% Jet A-1 (the maximum proportion currently authorized by ASTM when certifying Global Bioenergies’ process). These three batches of fuel were injected into the laboratory burner in order to quantify and characterize the non-volatile particles emitted during combustion, i.e. soot. Several representative conditions were tested to simulate soot emission levels, both on the ground and in flight.

The results obtained using neat SAF from Global Bioenergies show a 40-99% reduction in soot emissions compared with Jet A-1 fuel, depending on the conditions tested in the laboratory. The results obtained from the 50-50 blend show a reduction in particulate matter that is globally proportional to the SAF incorporation rate.

Louise Ganeau, research engineer at ONERA, explains, “Soot emitted during fuel combustion has an impact on air quality in airport areas. Incorporating SAFs such as Global Bioenergies’ into the fossil fuel landscape would help reduce soot emissions locally, and cut particulate pollution. Furthermore, from an environmental standpoint, SAF have a role to play in reducing net CO₂ emissions thanks to the way they are manufactured.”

Marc Delcourt, co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies, concludes, ” The properties of our fuel had already been validated when it obtained ASTM certification. The tests carried out today in the best French laboratories go even further in characterizing our product. These validations strengthen the attractiveness of our offer.”

During the A4E Aviation Summit taking place today in Brussels, the CEOs of Ryanair, IAG (International Airlines Group, whose main subsidiaries are British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus, Iberia Express, Level, as well as IAG Cargo and Avios Group), Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, respectively Michael O'Leary, Luis Gallego, Carsten Spohr and Benjamin Smith, expressed serious concerns about the feasibility of this ambitious target.

According to the CEOs of the main European airlines, the picture is worrying: the prohibitive costs and the limited availability of SAF represent insurmountable obstacles, seriously jeopardizing the competitiveness of the sector. Gallego stressed the urgent need for a European strategy that guarantees SAF at competitive prices, warning that without concrete interventions the only viable solution is to postpone the 2030 target. Spohr added fuel to the fire, calling on the EU to adopt ""light rules"" as part of the Green Deal. Both CEOs highlighted the lack of a coherent European strategy and an adequate regulatory framework to support the transition towards SAF.

The appeal of the 4 has sparked reactions at international level, first of all the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has expressed similar concerns regarding the availability of SAF and the associated costs. In particular, the association has underlined the need for government policies that incentivize the production of SAF and reduce costs. It has also highlighted the importance of investments in infrastructure and technologies to support the transition to sustainable fuels.

Let us not forget that the issue of SAFs is at the heart of the global debate on sustainable aviation, with several regions following suit and adopting similar policies and objectives. However, the challenge of large-scale production and cost reduction remains a significant obstacle, the solution of which seems far from being achieved. The request for a postponement raises questions about the implications for the EU's emission reduction targets and the aviation sector's commitment to sustainability.

This final determination officially signals the green light for Virgin Australia’s new 28 weekly flights between Australia and Doha – operated under a wet-lease with Qatar Airways – to proceed.

The ACCC’s authorisation of Qatar Airways’ partnership with Virgin Australia gives the Australian carrier access to the scale and expertise of a world-leading global airline and facilitates its re-entry into long-haul international flying. This will drive increased competition in the market while delivering greater choice and value for Australian passengers.

Utilising aircraft wet-leased from Qatar Airways, Virgin Australia is set to commence long-haul flights from Sydney, Brisbane and Perth to Doha from June 2025, followed by Melbourne to Doha in December 2025. Through the award-winning Hamad International Airport in Doha, the flights open up more than 100 connecting itineraries across Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and enable Australian passengers to benefit from a host of increased loyalty earn and redemption opportunities for Qatar Airways’ Privilege Club and Velocity members.

In addition to this, the flights will provide a significant boost to the Australian visitor and tourism economy, generating an estimated AUD$3 billion in economic value over the next five years.

The collaboration arrangement will also support jobs growth, both in Virgin Australia and across the broader aviation and tourism sectors in Australia, with Qatar Airways set to provide secondment opportunities for 20 Virgin Australia pilots and 40 cabin crew in 2025. Another important area of focus for the partnership is sustainability, which includes the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel initiatives.

This follows the Australian Government’s approval of Qatar Airways Group’s 25 per cent investment in Virgin Australia on 27 February 2025 – joining existing majority shareholder Bain Capital.

Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Officer, Engr. Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said: “Today’s announcement by the ACCC sends a clear signal of the appetite that exists for delivering competition, world-class service and value to Australian passengers.

“It also marks the start of a new chapter in the relationship between our two airlines, and I would like to thank our Virgin Australia colleagues and valued stakeholders for their tireless dedication to our shared ambition to create healthy competition within the local aviation market, as well as our collective commitment to supporting Australian businesses, Australian jobs and the wider economy.”

Virgin Australia Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Dave Emerson said: ""This is a defining moment for Virgin Australia and the Australian aviation landscape. The ACCC’s final approval of our deeper strategic partnership with Qatar Airways marks the start of a new chapter for our airline and a world of opportunities for our people and customers.

“Already, we are seeing some of the positive benefits of the partnership, including increased sale activity on airfares between Australia and Europe, the Middle East and Africa thanks to increased competition.

This involves the use of biochar, which is largely produced in Switzerland and removes and binds CO2 from the atmosphere in the long term.

With this important step, the company is doing important pioneering work in Swiss helicopter flying together with its customers, which is now being expanded.

Thanks to the consistent implementation of the sustainability strategy, over 1,400 tonnes of CO2 have been removed from the air in recent months. This remarkable figure underlines Swiss Helicopter’s firm commitment to climate protection. Pilot training and check flights, which have been completely CO2-compensated over the past two years, also represent an important part of the CO2 compensation already achieved.

From one April 2025, Swiss Helicopter AG will now extend this environmentally friendly approach to all of the flight school’s training flights. This means that in future, all training and further training flights by prospective and already licensed pilots will also be carried out in a CO2-compensated manner. Charter flights by private pilots will also be CO2-compensated in future as a result of this step.

This step will almost double the amount of CO2 offset. The corresponding certificates with plants have already been guaranteed by the supplier from Switzerland for the coming years.

With this initiative, Swiss Helicopter AG is making an important contribution to the important reduction of emissions in the aviation sector in addition to the continuous reduction of CO2.

The proposal from the Iowa Economic Development Authority was considered in a pair of legislative hearings Thursday at the Iowa Capitol, where stakeholder groups and lawmakers offered their thoughts.

IEDA Director Debi Durham said the goals for the redesign, established by her agency and the governor’s office, were to make Iowa’s network of tax incentives balanced and responsible, and to provide a return on investment to taxpayers.

Durham and lawmakers in support say it is time to redesign the state’s tax incentives because many were created when Iowa had a less-competitive overall tax structure. Since statehouse Republicans have in recent years lowered Iowa’s business and personal income tax rates, not all incentives remain necessary, proponents argued.

“We want incentives that will allow us to compete but at the same time grow our GDP and basically create wealth in Iowa, and we believe we have done that,” Durham said.

Under Durham’s proposal:

Durham said the legislation is not perfect and acknowledged that various stakeholders will take issue with some of the proposals.

Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, a Republican from Wilton who chairs the House’s committee on tax policy, praised the legislative package but also said he has heard some concerns that he believes lawmakers will find to have merit and want to work through.

“I think it’s an extremely aggressive and necessary change to our tax credit system. As our (personal income tax) rate has lowered down to 3.8 percent, the need for some of these things has diminished,” Kaufmann said. “I think it’s an aggressive bill and I think that’s a great thing. Our tax system has become competitive; we need to make sure our tax credit system is competitive.”

Iowa stakeholders offer feedback

Lobbyists representing local economic development agencies and chambers of commerce, housing developers, nonprofits and community foundations, taxpayer advocates and an Iowa-based film production company testified Thursday during the public comment periods of the two legislative hearings.

Nonprofit and community foundation leaders were vocal in their opposition to the proposal to end the annual allocation to the Endow Iowa credit. Multiple speakers said the credit is vital to encouraging donors in their communities.

Lynne Carroll, executive director of Heart of Iowa Big Brothers Big Sisters in Marshall County, said the organization was able to start an endowment that benefits the community and has since grown thanks to Endow Iowa.

“The only reason that (endowment) has grown is due to the Endow Iowa tax credit,” Carroll said. “Those funds continue to help small nonprofits like me to be able to reinvest in the community — not just in that program or that agency for today or for this fiscal year, but for long term.”

A lobbyist for Kemin Industries, a biotech human and animal food company, said the proposed $40 million cap on what would be the renamed Research and Development Tax Credit would create uncertainty for Iowa businesses. The lobbyist said that uncertainty could sway a company that is considering whether to invest in Iowa or another state with a more robust research and development tax credit.

“From a certainty perspective for a business, be they someone large like Kemin or a startup, introducing the cap at $40 million will interject a lot of uncertainty for a business that decides that they may want to try to claim that credit and make business investment decisions in this state based on the availability of that credit being there,” Kemin lobbyist Dane Schumann said.

The proposal to add sustainable aviation fuel and boost the funding for the Renewable Chemical Production tax credit was welcomed by biofuels companies.

“Stakeholders from Iowa and beyond have had a conversation about what is necessary to bring staff to Iowa, and this is an excellent opportunity for the state to have new production,” said Kent Hartwig, of Gevo, a Colorado-based renewable fuels and chemicals company focused on aviation fuel. “These plants are substantial. They’re billion-plus investments that have massive trickle-down effects. …

“As we look to build these facilities that have significant capital investment, we need investment. We need Wall Street to say, ‘This is a place to invest.’ So incentives like this are meaningful. They will provide us with another chip to go to these Wall Street investors and say Iowa is a place to build this plant.”

Both of the twin bills, House Study Bill 305 and Senate Study Bill 1205, were approved by subcommittee panels of state legislators Thursday. That makes both eligible for consideration by the House and Senate Ways and Means committees.

Kaufmann said the House bill will be considered by the full committee in two weeks.

The proposed changes include introducing a new tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel production and temporarily increasing tax credits for workforce housing.

Some in the business community have concerns about the implementation of a cap on the research activities credit and the elimination of the Endow Iowa program.

Supporters of the revamp argue that it will help Iowa maintain a competitive business environment while ensuring fiscal responsibility.

Iowa lawmakers have pushed forward the state economic development chief's proposed wide-ranging revamp of financial incentives used to spur business development that they predict will result in ""significant"" savings for the state.

Industry partners are embracing the Iowa Economic Development Authority's pitch for a new tax credit that would encourage sustainable aviation fuel production and for a temporary boost to workforce housing tax credits, which require projects to be priced affordably for entry-level workers, seniors and families.

But there was some pushback from the business community on a provision that would implement a cap on Iowa's research activities credit and on the proposed elimination of the Endow Iowa program that nonprofits say encourages philanthropic giving.

In partnership with the governor's office, Debi Durham, director of the IEDA and Iowa Finance Authority, said agency officials considered how to overhaul business development incentives while being fiscally responsible.

After Iowa legislators cut corporate, income and other taxes in recent years, Durham said the more targeted slate of incentives would help Iowa maintain a competitive business environment.

""There's some people that say to me, 'Well, we don't need incentives as we just become more competitive,' and I wish we lived in that world, but we don't, because if you've got 49 other governors and economic developers, they're competing,"" Durham said. ""We want incentives that will allow us to compete, but at the same time grow our GDP and basically create wealth in Iowa. And we believe we have done that.""

The new incentives would be capped at $110 million annually, a sharp drop from the existing $170 million cap.

However, the state doesn't always dole out the maximum amount for each tax credit program, so Durham said the amount the state would save is ""significant"" but didn't yet know the exact fiscal impact of the proposal.

As lawmakers on House and Senate Ways and Means subcommittees advanced the measure Thursday, they were overall positive about the proposals, House Study Bill 305 and Senate Study Bill 1205. The bills stoked larger conversation about the role of financial incentives in enticing economic development projects.

""I just have a hard time keeping all of these programs in place in perpetuity, because at what point in time are we trying to stimulate an activity, and at what point in time does it become a subsidy in perpetuity?"" said Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs, chair of the Senate's tax policy committee.

Sen. Bill Dotzler, D-Waterloo, said he largely saw the bill as a positive, but had some concerns about scaling back certain programs.

""I see some real pluses in here, and I know that she (Durham) got the direction that they need to find some savings in economic development, and unfortunately, we put a squeeze on her over the years that I wasn't very supportive of because I think economic development policies are the driver offunding everything in this state,"" Dotzler said. ""I mean, if you're a big fan of education or health care orwhatever, this is where it comes from.""

Rep. Derek Wulf, R-Hudson, said the bill was a ""great start” but had concerns about the proposed changes to the research activities credit program and Endow Iowa.

How would the IEDA alter tax credit programs?

Durham is proposing vastly reshaping the state's financial incentives:

Replace the High-Quality Jobs Program with Business Incentives for Growth. Reduce the allocation from $68 million to $50 million.

Sunset the state's Angel Investor Tax Credit program, established in 2002 to jumpstart venture capital investment in Iowa startups. Create a new Seed Investor Program in combination with an existing Innovation Fund. The state would offer $10 million a year in tax credits.

Replace the existing Renewable Chemical Production Tax Credit with one for sustainable aviation fuel. The state would double allowable credits from $5 million to $10 million annually.

Replace the uncapped research activities tax credit program administered by the Iowa Department of Revenue with one run by IEDA and institute a $40 million annual cap. This would save about $16 million a year, though the amount currently doled out varies. The new program would be limited to specific industries and require an application.

Temporarily bump the $35 million workforce housing tax credit program to $43 million in fiscal year 2026 (the budget year spanning July 1 through June 30, 2026) and $40 million in fiscal year 2027, addressing pent-up demand from when the COVID-19 pandemic caused supply chain issues and delayed projects.

Keep the redevelopment (brownfield/grayfield) tax credit allocation at $15 million to transform abandoned and underused properties, but making some technical changes to the current verification process.

Maintain the $45 million allocation to the historic preservation tax credit program, but make owner-occupied single-family homes ineligible.

Eliminate the Endow Iowa program that helps community foundations attract donations with donors getting a state tax credit equal to 25% of the gifts, up to $100,000. Cutting it would save $6 million annually.

Establish a two-year pilot program for in-state film production. That program would provide a rebate after expenses to projects that qualify — up to $10 million annually.

Sunset or repeal tax credits for targeted jobs (saving about $2.2 million), assistive devices and employer child care. It would save about $2 million to cut the employer child care tax credit, which has never been used since its creation in 2022.

What do businesses, other groups say?

Kent Hartwig, director of state government affairs for Gevo, a renewable fuels and chemicals company with a focus on commercializing sustainable aviation fuel, said the proposal presented ""significant opportunity"" for the sustainable aviation fuel industry in Iowa.

He said it would help companies build sustainable aviation fuel plants, which typically exceed $1 billion.

""As we look at the opportunities to grow and where should we build, we need to have the ability to finance these plants,"" Hartwig said. ""And so this is the type of incentive that says to Wall Street invest inGevo, invest in SAF, because there's a support system in place.""

Officials with community foundations and nonprofits opposed eliminating the Endow Iowa tax credit and feared it would hinder development prospects, especially in rural areas or communities that have relied on donations to pursue major projects or recover from disasters.

Christina Bateman, a lifelong Atlantic resident, said her town relied on a $23 million gift using the Endow Iowa program to give a boost to a $75 million public-private partnership creating a new child development center, 144 new housing units and expanding an existing YMCA.

“Rural communities just really need all the tools in the toolbox in order to be successful,"" she said, asking to keep tax credits as they are.

Nate Ristow, president and CEO of the Iowa Taxpayers Association, said the research activities credit is one of the key incentives for Iowa businesses.

Based on a survey of the group's members, he said estimates show Iowa businesses have invested $3 billion in research in Iowa, and that employs more than 20,000 Iowans. Jobs pay more than $100,000 a year on average.

""These are good, paying jobs that Iowans fill, and where companies do their research is where they produce, and investments made in research lead to new innovative products, new production lines and new businesses,"" Ristow said.

Speakers were resoundingly pleased to see more funding toward the workforce housing tax credit program to address high demand for more affordable housing.

Craig Patterson, representing the Professional Developers of Iowa, an association of economic development professionals, said ""the workforce housing piece is a huge, huge win for us"" and hoped to see expanded funding become permanent.

But there were concerns about Senate File 465, which tweaked the eligibility for historic preservation tax credits.

Rebecca McCarley, of Cedar Rapids, told lawmakers barring single-family homes from participating in the program would threaten small-scale efforts, often led by nonprofits, to rehabilitate single homes at a time.

""This is going to have a huge economic impact,"" McCarley said.","https://www.desmoinesregister.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/10/02/PDEM/75486910007-reynolds-india-cs-010.jpg?crop=8639,4861,x0,y449&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-03-28 07:56:29.015325

NextGen CDR Facility’s clientele spans a diverse array of industries, reflecting a broad commitment to carbon removal across the corporate spectrum.","This week, high-quality carbon dioxide removal (CDR) facility NextGen welcomed a major new buyer for its curated portfolio of durable CO2 removal projects.

Japanese megabank Mizuho Financial Group, the world’s 15th largest bank with assets totaling $2 trillion, has become the latest buyer of carbon removal through NextGen.

Happening at a time when securing carbon removal funding still poses a challenge for many in the industry, this landmark partnership signals trust in this rising decarbonization sector, setting an example for other businesses and organizations to include CDR into their sustainability strategies.

NextGen, a joint venture between South Pole and Mitsubishi Corporation, offers its clients access to high-integrity CDRs delivered by solutions that successfully store carbon for more than 1,000 years at an average price of $200/tonne.

Patrick Bürgi, Chairperson of NextGen and Managing Director Japan / Co-Founder at South Pole, shared that NextGen, South Pole, and Mitsubishi Corporation are delighted to welcome a globally leading financial institution like Mizuho among the list of CDR buyers.

He stated, “Carbon dioxide removals are critical to climate action, now more than ever. We need more institutions entering the market from every angle. Meanwhile, NextGen remains committed to upholding high integrity and low risk through our diversified portfolio approach.”

«Companies and governments must partake in carbon removal,» Megan Kemp, NextGen CDR

Shinichi Tsunoda, operating officer & general manager of Mizuho Financial Group, Inc., commented, “For Mizuho, participating in the early NextGen initiative as a buyer constitutes our first step into the technology-based CDR field at the core of decarbonization.”

“Going forward, Mizuho will positively contribute to the broader implementation of technologies that will further technology-based CDR in Japan, as well as to the commercialization of the CDR field.”

Following the announcement of this deal, our team had the chance to ask Megan Kemp, Global Head of Strategy at South Pole and NextGen CDR, a few questions around this milestone development and future vision of CDR.

Carbon Herald: What are your expectations for 2025 in terms of CDR purchases? Do you expect more companies to make the same move as Mizuho?

Megan Kemp:

2025 is set to be a pivotal year for carbon dioxide removal (CDR), with corporate purchases continuing to accelerate. According to CDR.fyi, purchases of durable CDR grew 78% in 2024, and deliveries rose by 120%. This trajectory suggests that demand will continue to grow as companies recognize the importance of securing high-durability removals early, however the decline in the number of unique buyers (down 18%), mean there is still significant work to do to support bolder corporate engagement.

NextGen CDR expects to see more companies following in the footsteps of Mizuho and other early movers. Organizations are increasingly driven by a combination of factors: mitigating regulatory risk, building sustainable branding, and strategically investing in a market expected to expand significantly in the coming decades. We are already witnessing increased participation from financial institutions, consulting firms, and industrial players who are locking in high-quality supply ahead of anticipated regulatory shifts.

Commenting on the recent inclusion of carbon dioxide removal in the draft version of the Corporate Net-Zero Standard V2 released by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), Megan states,

While we welcome SBTi’s inclusion of near- and long-term removal targets for Scope 1 emissions and believe it will improve market signalling on demand, there is room for much greater ambition in this area. This is a step in the right direction, but not yet a breakthrough moment for durable carbon dioxide removals (CDRs).

To drive real progress, these targets must be made more specific and actionable, ensuring companies address their ongoing and residual emissions while investing in the critical, future removal infrastructure we need – today. Let’s also not forget that both nature-based and technological removals are critical for achieving long-term climate goals and resilience.

Relevant: SBTi Opens Door To Carbon Removal, Releases Net-Zero Standard For Public Consultation

However, voluntary demand alone will not be sufficient to scale to the levels required by 2050. Government action remains crucial in setting clear compliance signals and de-risking investments in CDR.

NextGen CDR continues to work with policymakers in the US, EU, Japan, and the UK to ensure that robust and scalable policies support the long-term growth of this market.

Governments such as the US, Canada and Denmark have committed to purchase CDR, which we will see come to fruition in 2025, and potentially drive a wave of follow-on investment in government diligenced projects.

In 2025, we anticipate further momentum as more companies recognize that CDR is not just a cost but a strategic investment in a net-zero future.

What changes need to be made within the carbon removal sector to stimulate bolder corporate CDR investments?

To unlock bolder corporate investments in carbon dioxide removal (CDR), several critical barriers must be addressed:

Cost Sensitivity: Corporates remain highly price-sensitive to technological CDR solutions, with the 2024 average price at $350/t. Large-scale adoption will require cost reductions, making investment in scaling efforts over the next 1–3 years essential. Governments play a crucial role in accelerating cost declines through subsidies, innovation funding, large-scale procurement, and contracts for difference.

Unclear Corporate Claiming Guidance: The inclusion of interim targets for permanent CDR credits in SBTi’s draft Corporate Net-Zero Standard Version 2.0 is a step in the right direction. However, it is essential to extend this to Scope 2 and 3 emissions to ensure meaningful corporate action today and drive market scale.

Slow Compliance Market Integration: Technological CDR will remain expensive and below the necessary scale unless fully integrated into compliance markets. While the UK, EU, and Japan have committed to including tech-based CDR, progress has been slow. Speeding up this transition is key to creating long-term demand signals.

Market Complexity and Trust: With over 30 standards, 100+ methodologies, and multiple overseeing bodies, navigating the CDR market remains challenging. The introduction of the ICVCM’s Core Carbon Principles will help establish clarity on high-quality standards, while the EU’s development of BECCS and DACS methodologies under the CRCF will provide a critical baseline for voluntary and compliance markets.

Looking ahead to 2025, we see a clear path to overcoming these barriers. The speed of change will be the decisive factor in driving stronger corporate commitments and accelerating the scale-up of high-quality CDR solutions.

Do you notice a specific company profile among your clients? Are NextGen services procured by specific industries?

NextGen CDR Facility’s clientele spans a diverse array of industries, reflecting a broad commitment to carbon removal across the corporate spectrum.

Our founding buyers include Boston Consulting Group (management consulting), LGT (private banking and asset management), Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (shipping and logistics), Swiss Re (insurance), and UBS (financial services).

The addition of Mizuho Bank, a prominent financial institution, further underscores the financial sector’s proactive engagement in carbon removal initiatives.

This diversity among our clients indicates that NextGen’s services are not confined to specific industries; rather, they appeal to organizations across various sectors that are committed to achieving net-zero emissions, collectively scaling the market and addressing climate change through durable carbon removal solutions.

Are there other CDR collaborations in the pipeline that would further enrich the NextGen portfolio?

NextGen will complete its diversified portfolio of high-quality, permanent carbon dioxide removals in 2025. We will be contracting several new long term offtakes from a range of technology types and geographies, which will announce throughout the year.

By increasing the number of long term offtake agreements we enter in to, we are able to stimulate the CDR market by:

enabling projects to become bankable and attract the necessary project financing for their CapEx intensive projects.

What is Airbus ZEROe?
Airbus notes that, with ZEROe, it was looking ""to explore the feasibility of two primary hydrogen propulsion technologies: hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells.""
ZEROe A380 testbed shelved as Airbus looks to develop a global ecosystem One of the most interesting aspects of the Airbus ZEROe program in its early years was the fact that the manufacturer was looking to use the first-ever A380 as a testbed for the new hydrogen engines.
However, as reported recently by Aerospace Testing International, Airbus has since decided to shelve the plans to use a modified superjumbo as a testbed for its new ZEROe hydrogen engines.","Recent years have seen sustainability become an increasingly important factor in major decision-making processes across all facets of the modern aviation industry. Airlines, airports, and aircraft manufacturers located all around the world are working hard to optimize their operations, with initiatives pertaining to sustainability often finding themselves at the heart of this drive in the race to net zero by 2050.

In terms of aircraft themselves, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is widely considered to be a useful stepping stone, as it can be used in varying blends on conventional commercial aircraft. However, in the longer term, manufacturers are considering alternative propulsion methods, and the potential design alterations that would need to be made on new planes in order to accommodate this. For Airbus, the future of the company's commercial aircraft manufacturing lies in the ZEROe.

What is Airbus ZEROe?

Airbus has long been something of an innovator in the diverse and dynamic world of commercial aviation, with its maiden airliner, the A300, being the first widebody aircraft in the world to be powered by just two jet engines. Since then, it has continued to make history, with the multinational planemaker's A380 being the first-ever commercial jetliner with two full passenger decks. In recent years, the firm's A321XLR has been touted as the future of long-haul narrowbody flights.

Want to know more about sustainability in aviation?

However, Airbus has also been looking further into the future with concepts for brand-new aircraft powered by alternative propulsion systems. It first revealed these in September of 2020, when, in order to celebrate Zero Emissions Day, the manufacturer unveiled designs for three all-new aircraft that would be powered by hydrogen instead of conventional jet fuel or SAF . Commenting on the launch of the project, known as ZEROe, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury stated that:

""This is a historic moment for the commercial aviation sector as a whole and we intend to play a leading role in the most important transition this industry has ever seen. The concepts we unveil today offer the world a glimpse of our ambition to drive a bold vision for the future of zero-emission flight. I strongly believe that the use of hydrogen - both in synthetic fuels and as a primary power source for commercial aircraft - has the potential to significantly reduce aviation's climate impact.""

Airbus notes that, with ZEROe, it was looking ""to explore the feasibility of two primary hydrogen propulsion technologies: hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells."" The company has since decided on hydrogen fuel cell technology as the primary propulsion method for these aircraft, explaining that ""the results of the fuel cell prototype and powertrain testing, as well as research into complementary technology such as cryogenics, supported the viability of this technology.""

Four different designs

Given the famously diverse nature of the commercial aviation sector, which has always been a dynamic industry, but especially in recent years, as airlines' fleets and networks have grown, there is no 'one size fits all' solution to hydrogen propulsion. This is why Airbus launched the ZEROe program with three different concepts, and it has since added a fourth to its repertoire as research into the matter continues.

Two of these feature conventional fuselages, at least in relation to the kinds of aircraft that we are used to in commercial aviation. The first is a turbofan-powered airliner designed to carry up to 200 passengers for distances of more than 2,000 NM (3,704 km), with hybrid-hydrogen engines providing thrust. This will be joined by a twin-turboprop design able to carry up to 100 passengers more than 1,000 NM (1,852 km), powered by hybrid-hydrogen engines with eight-blade propellers.

Moving away from these aircraft designs that have relatively conventional fuselage structures in terms of what we are currently used to, Airbus' third initial ZEROe design was a Blended-Wing Body (BWB) aircraft. The company aimed for this plane to have similar capacity and range specifications to its hydrogen turbofan design, but, as pictured below, it would feature a blended fuselage with engines on the top.

In December of 2020, Airbus subsequently revealed a fourth ZEROe concept. This was ""based on an electric propeller propulsion system powered by hydrogen fuel cells which transform the hydrogen into electricity through a chemical reaction."" As Simple Flying reported at the time, this would be powered by six quick-swap removable fuel cell pods ""that act as standalone turboprop motors"" and have eight-blade propellers made of composite materials. Airbus went on to note recently that:

""In 2023, the ZEROe teams powered on the future hydrogen-propulsion system designed for the fully electric concept aircraft.""

Originally aiming for a 2035 introduction

At the time of the project's launch, Airbus set itself the goal of getting its new hydrogen-powered commercial airliners into commercial service by 2035. This gave the company a 15-year window to get the project over the line, with hurdles such as investment, hydrogen storage and transportation, and refueling capabilities at airports among the major hurdles. Speaking in 2020, Guillaume Faury stated:

""These concepts will help us explore and mature the design and layout of the world's first climate-neutral, zero-emission commercial aircraft, which we aim to put into service by 2035. The transition to hydrogen, as the primary power source for these concept planes, will require decisive action from the entire aviation ecosystem. Together with the support from government and industrial partners we can rise up to this challenge to scale up renewable energy and hydrogen for the sustainable future of the aviation industry.""

As mentioned earlier, airlines, airports, and manufacturers across the globe are working on the shared sustainability goal of getting their emissions down to net zero by 2050. As such, getting its new ZEROe hydrogen-powered aircraft into service by 2035 would put Airbus well ahead of the curve. This timeline also allows a cushion for delays, which looks like a useful factor based on recent developments.

Latest news: heavy delays

Indeed, according to a report last month by Sustainability Magazine, Airbus now believes that it is more realistic to target the late 2040s as the timeframe for full-scale commercial deployment of its new ZEROe hydrogen-powered airliners. This is because, as the publication puts it, ""the anticipated hydrogen economy required for successful deployment may be five to 10 years behind Airbus's expectations.""

The projected delays reportedly largely boil down to a lack of confidence in current hydrogen infrastructure availability. After all, for such aircraft to be deployed on a global scale, the relevant infrastructure would have to be rolled out worldwide. However, research on this front has slowed, as Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury recently made a point of noting during a recent interview with Sustainability Magazine:

""There's been a lot of work in the last years on bringing a green hydrogen supply to a number of industries as a way to decarbonize. Analysis of the landscape and progress has shown that a lot of projects have been put on the back burner, have been delayed, or are of lesser importance than what was expected five years ago. By entering a hydrogen plane into service, there would need to be sufficient green hydrogen supplies, so we are working with airports.""

Faury notes that some progress has been made on this front, with Airbus having ""partnered with a number of airports which are willing to start introducing hydrogen in their operations ahead of the plane [coming into service]."" However, the company has yet to see ""the growth of the ecosystem that we need to see happening with sufficient confidence to gain comfort that entry into service would be successful from the hydrogen supply perspective,"" so ZEROe will be delayed.

ZEROe A380 testbed shelved as Airbus looks to develop a global ecosystem

One of the most interesting aspects of the Airbus ZEROe program in its early years was the fact that the manufacturer was looking to use the first-ever A380 as a testbed for the new hydrogen engines. This was confirmed in February of 2022, with various factors making the quadjet an ideal aircraft for the job. As noted in coverage by Simple Flying at the time of the announcement, these included the extra redundancy offered by its extra engines and the extra space onboard.

However, as reported recently by Aerospace Testing International, Airbus has since decided to shelve the plans to use a modified superjumbo as a testbed for its new ZEROe hydrogen engines. According to the Financial Times, this news came as part of a wider package of cuts on this front, with the publication noting that Airbus will ""cut the budget dedicated to its hydrogen initiatives by 25%.""

Despite the disappointment attached to these recent developments, Airbus remains confident in its plans to build a global hydrogen ecosystem. According to the multinational European planemaker, the company has already amassed a list of ""more than 220 airports as partners, in addition to numerous energy providers and airlines"" in its attempts to take hydrogen technology global. This will be a key step forward in ensuring that its ZEROe program faces no further delays.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/main-image-16_9-106.png,N,,2025-03-28 06:56:07.186423

The SAF Registry is intended to help solve the challenge of limited SAF supply, which IATA says is acutely scarce and available in only a few locations globally, by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location. In addition, it gives airlines’ corporate customers access to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalizes on the capacity of firms to co-finance the cost of decarbonization. Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027, after which it will be operated on a cost recovery basis.

1. Introduction

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) are derived from biomass, organic waste, and carbon dioxide, offering an alternative to traditional aviation fuels composed of fossil fuels and hydrocarbons. The primary goal of SAF utilization in the modern day is to decrease carbon emissions in the aviation industry while maintaining traditional aviation fuels’ unique chemical properties, consistent with improved resistance to temperature fluctuations, freezing, and high-temperature explosions. Recent efforts to achieve this goal include initiatives led by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in the aviation industry by 2050. Nevertheless, the aviation industry accounts for approximately 2% of greenhouse gas emissions internationally, highlighting the importance of SAFs in mitigating the effects of global warming by implementing normal and isomeric alkenes to mimic the properties of traditional fuels [1].

Various materials have been proposed as feedstock for SAF production. Among the most prevalent production pathways include hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFAs), derived from vegetable oils, algae-based oils, and animal fats refined through the two-phased process of hydrogenation. Alcohol-to-jet (AJT) technologies have also been used to alter the carbon structure of alcohols, such as ethanol and isobutanol, through molecular bonding and deoxygenation. Additionally, power-to-liquid (PtL) has shown promise in converting carbon-containing materials, renewable electricity, and non-fossil carbon dioxide to produce refinable synthetic liquid hydrocarbons and crude oils by combining hydrogen synthesized from water electrolysis with carbon dioxide (CO₂) captured through Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis [2]

However, significant barriers remain preventing large-scale SAF production. Although HEFA has already shown promise as a commercially viable SAF pathway, ATJ, PtL, and FT technologies are still in early development. Moreover, many sustainable feedstocks used for these processes have also raised biodiversity and deforestation concerns, are limited in supply, and often compete with other industries that heavily depend on these materials, such as biodiesel production [3]. Additionally, global infrastructure facilitating SAF refinement, transportation, and storage is scarce, rendering production logistically challenging.

This paper will evaluate recent advances in the development and scalability of SAF technologies. With an emphasis on identifying efficient and cost-effective producing methods using various feedstocks like algae, biowaste, and renewable electricity to reduce carbon emissions within aviation while meeting growing industrial demands, this review will also discuss research into blending ratio optimization, life cycle analysis, and policy frameworks to incentivize large-scale SAF adoption despite recent challenges in the field.

2. Feedstocks for Sustainable Aviation Fuels

2.1 Algae-Based SAF

Algae-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production relies on microalgae and cyanobacteria, which can efficiently convert CO₂, water, and sunlight into lipids suitable for biofuel conversion. As illustrated in Figure 1, algae accumulate high lipid contents under optimized conditions, making them a promising alternative to conventional oil crops [35]. The process typically involves cultivation in open ponds or photobioreactors, followed by

lipid extraction and hydroprocessing to generate hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA), the most widely accepted SAF pathway [4].

One of the primary advantages of algae-derived SAF is its high biomass yield and minimal land-use impact, allowing for production without competing with food supply chains. Furthermore, microalgae can be cultivated using non-arable land, saline water, and industrial waste streams rich in CO₂, enhancing sustainability [5]. However, scalability remains challenging due to the high costs associated with cultivation, harvesting, and lipid extraction. Improvements in genetic engineering and strain selection have led to enhanced lipid accumulation and growth rates, with recent studies demonstrating lipid contents exceeding 50% of dry biomass in optimized conditions [6].

Despite its potential, commercial viability depends on reducing energy-intensive processing steps. Current research focuses on integrated biorefineries that utilize residual biomass for biochar, biogas, or high-value co-products to offset costs. Additionally, advancements in direct catalytic conversion of whole algae biomass—bypassing lipid extraction—are being explored to improve process efficiency and economic feasibility [7].

2.2 Waste Biomass and Residual Feedstocks

Waste biomass-derived SAF leverages agricultural residues, forestry waste, municipal solid waste (MSW), and industrial byproducts to create drop-in fuels while reducing landfill waste and emissions. The most common conversion methods include thermochemical processes such as gasification-Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis and pyrolysis, which break down biomass into synthesis gas (syngas) or bio-oil, respectively, before upgrading into aviation-compatible hydrocarbons [8].

Agricultural residues, including corn stover, wheat straw, and sugarcane bagasse, are rich in cellulose and lignin, making them ideal for biofuel production through enzymatic hydrolysis or catalytic depolymerization. Forestry residues, such as sawdust and bark, have also been utilized in bio-oil production through fast pyrolysis, with upgraded biofuels showing promising fuel properties comparable to conventional jet fuel [9]. Additionally, MSW conversion provides a scalable alternative by repurposing plastic waste and organic fractions into liquid hydrocarbons through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and catalytic cracking [10].

Challenges in waste biomass utilization include heterogeneous feedstock composition, which affects conversion efficiency and fuel quality. Advanced pretreatment methods, such as steam explosion and torrefaction, have been employed to enhance biomass reactivity and improve overall process yields. Recent studies indicate that blending bio-based intermediates with petroleum-derived fractions can improve SAF compatibility and cost-effectiveness, supporting wider industry adoption [11].

2.3 Renewable Electricity and Power-to-Liquid (PtL) Fuels

Power-to-liquid (PtL) technology enables synthetic fuel production from CO₂ and renewable electricity, offering a fully decarbonized alternative to conventional aviation fuels. The process involves electrolytic hydrogen (H₂) production via water electrolysis, followed by FT synthesis or methanol-to-jet (MTJ) conversion, where hydrogen reacts with captured CO₂ to form liquid hydrocarbons suitable for aviation applications [12].

One key advantage of PtL fuels is their potential for carbon-neutral operation, as the CO₂ used in production can be sourced from direct air capture (DAC), industrial flue gases, or biogenic emissions. When coupled with wind, solar, or hydroelectric power, PtL fuels achieve near-zero lifecycle emissions while ensuring fuel security and scalability independent of biomass availability [13]. However, high energy input requirements and electrolyzer efficiency limitations currently hinder large-scale deployment.

Advancements in high-temperature co-electrolysis using solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) have demonstrated higher conversion efficiencies and lower operational costs than conventional alkaline or PEM electrolysis. Additionally, catalysts optimized for selective CO₂ hydrogenation are improving hydrocarbon yield and product selectivity, making PtL fuels more commercially viable [14]. However, recent techno-economic assessments indicate that PtL fuels currently have higher production costs compared to fossil jet fuel, with projections suggesting that cost parity may not be achieved in the near term. Factors such as the high energy requirements for electrolysis, limited availability of low-cost renewable electricity, and the nascent state of carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure contribute to these challenges. For instance, a 2023 study reported that the production costs for e-kerosene are higher than recent fossil jet fuel prices, ranging from approximately $340 to $1,370 per ton, depending on various factors including electricity costs and plant scale [15]. These findings suggest that significant technological advancements and policy interventions will be necessary to make PtL fuels economically competitive with traditional jet fuels.

2.4 Comparison of SAF Feedstocks: Benefits, Challenges, and Maturity

As evidenced by section 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, SAFs can be derived from various feedstocks, each with unique advantages and challenges. Algae-based SAF offers high lipid yields and can be grown on non-arable land, but its commercial viability is limited by high production and extraction costs. Waste biomass and residual feedstocks, including agricultural and municipal waste, provide a scalable and cost-effective SAF pathway, though feedstock variability and pretreatment costs pose challenges. This pathway is already commercially viable. PtL fuels, produced using renewable electricity and captured CO₂, present a fully decarbonized alternative, independent of biomass availability. However, high energy demands and infrastructure costs currently limit widespread adoption. As summarized in Table 1, waste biomass-based SAF is the most commercially mature, while algae and PtL fuels hold long-term potential with continued advancements in cost reduction, technology scaling, and policy support.

3.Production Pathways and Optimization Strategies

3.1 Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA)

Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) represent the most commercially viable pathway for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, accounting for the majority of current SAF supply. The process involves hydrotreatment of renewable lipid feedstocks, such as vegetable oils, waste fats, and algal lipids (primarily in the forms of cooking oil or animal fats), to produce drop-in biofuels that meet conventional jet fuel specifications. Observable in Figure 2, HEFA fuels undergo hydrodeoxygenation, hydrocracking, and isomerization to remove oxygen and adjust hydrocarbon chain length, resulting in a fuel with high energy density and compatibility with existing aviation infrastructure [16].

One of the key advantages of HEFA-based SAF is its low sulfur content and improved combustion characteristics, leading to reduced particulate emissions compared to petroleum-derived jet fuel. However, feedstock availability and cost remain primary constraints to large-scale adoption. While waste fats and used cooking oils provide cost-effective alternatives, their limited supply necessitates the expansion of dedicated oilseed crops, such as camelina and carinate, or advancements in high-lipid algae cultivation [17].

Recent research has focused on catalyst optimization and process integration to improve HEFA yield and reduce hydrogen consumption. Studies on NiMo and CoMo catalysts have demonstrated improved deoxygenation efficiency, while novel bifunctional catalysts incorporating zeolites enhance selectivity for jet-range hydrocarbons [18]. Additionally, co-processing HEFA intermediates in petroleum refineries is emerging as a cost-effective strategy, leveraging existing infrastructure to scale SAF production [17].

3.2 Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) Conversion

The alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway utilizes fermentation-derived alcohols, such as ethanol, butanol, and isobutanol, as precursors for SAF production. The process involves dehydration, oligomerization, hydrogenation, and distillation to convert short-chain alcohols into branched and cyclic hydrocarbons that meet jet fuel specifications [19].

A key advantage of ATJ fuels is their feedstock flexibility, as alcohols can be produced from lignocellulosic biomass, municipal solid waste, and syngas fermentation. However, the pathway is less mature than HEFA and requires higher processing energy due to the additional chemical steps involved [19]. Additionally, selectivity and catalyst efficiency play crucial roles in determining overall fuel yield and economic feasibility.

Recent advancements include improved dehydration catalysts, such as zeolite-based materials, which enhance conversion efficiency and minimize byproduct formation. Additionally, genetically engineered microbial strains have been developed to increase alcohol titers in fermentation, reducing downstream processing costs [19]. In a recent study, an optimized ATJ process using butanol from biomass fermentation achieved a conversion efficiency of 84% with a jet fuel yield exceeding 50% by weight—a significant improvement over earlier designs [19].

Despite its potential, ATJ SAF remains more expensive than HEFA-derived fuels, with production costs largely dependent on feedstock sourcing and process energy requirements. Ongoing research into integrated biorefineries and process intensification is expected to improve the pathway’s commercial viability [20].

3.3 Gasification and Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis

Gasification followed by FT synthesis is a thermochemical pathway for SAF production, converting solid biomass, municipal solid waste (MSW), and other carbonaceous feedstocks into liquid hydrocarbons via syngas (CO + H₂). The process consists of high-temperature gasification, syngas cleaning, FT synthesis, and hydrocracking to generate aviation-compatible fuels [20].

The FT pathway is particularly attractive due to its feedstock versatility and ability to produce a wide range of hydrocarbons, including diesel and jet fuel. Additionally, FT-derived SAF has excellent combustion characteristics, featuring a high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio and near-zero sulfur content, resulting in reduced particulate emissions compared to conventional jet fuel [20].

Despite these advantages, FT SAF faces significant economic barriers due to high capital investment requirements and relatively low process efficiency. One of the primary challenges is syngas purification, as contaminants such as tars, ammonia, and sulfur compounds can poison FT catalysts and reduce overall conversion efficiency [20].

Recent advancements in biomass pretreatment, catalyst development, and process intensification have led to improved FT SAF yields. For instance, Co-based and Fe-based FT catalysts have been optimized for higher selectivity towards jet-range hydrocarbons, while hybrid gasification approaches incorporating plasma-enhanced and catalytic gasification have shown promise in reducing syngas cleaning costs [20].

A key area of research focuses on blending FT SAF with conventional fuels to improve fuel properties and emissions performance. Recent trials indicate that a 50/50 FT-blended fuel can achieve CO₂ lifecycle reductions of up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, supporting regulatory approval and industry adoption [20].

3.4 Emerging Catalytic and Electrochemical Approaches

Beyond conventional SAF pathways, emerging catalytic and electrochemical conversion technologies are being explored to enhance process efficiency and reduce carbon intensity. These include direct CO₂ hydrogenation, electrochemical CO₂ reduction, and biocatalytic routes that utilize engineered microbes for hydrocarbon synthesis [20]. One promising approach is high-temperature co-electrolysis, where solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are used to convert CO₂ and H₂O into syngas, which can then be processed into SAF via FT synthesis. This method has demonstrated higher conversion efficiencies and lower energy penalties compared to traditional electrolysis and gasification routes [20].

Another innovative pathway involves heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of CO₂, utilizing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and single-atom catalysts to selectively produce liquid hydrocarbons. Recent studies have reported conversion efficiencies exceeding 60% with low-temperature, low-pressure operation, making this approach attractive for distributed SAF production [20]. Biotechnological advancements are also contributing to SAF development, with genetically engineered microbes capable of directly converting CO₂ into hydrocarbons via engineered metabolic pathways. For example, engineered Clostridium strains have demonstrated continuous biofuel production from industrial CO₂ waste streams, providing a sustainable and scalable alternative to fossil-based aviation fuels [20].

While still at the early TRL (Technology Readiness Level) stages, these emerging technologies hold long-term potential for cost-effective, carbon-neutral SAF production. Future research will focus on scaling these approaches, integrating them with renewable energy sources, and improving catalyst longevity and process stability [20].

4. Optimizing SAF Blending and Lifecycle Analysis

4.1 SAF Blending Ratios for Performance and Emissions

Sustainable aviation fuel is designed to be compatible with existing aircraft engines and infrastructure through blending with conventional jet fuel. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has established specifications under ASTM D7566, which currently permit blending ratios of up to 50% with conventional jet fuel, depending on the production pathway [21]. These specifications ensure that the blended fuel meets the necessary performance and safety standards for aviation operations while maintaining engine reliability and fuel efficiency. While most commercial operations use SAF blends up to 50%, certain SAF pathways, such as Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK) and Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (HEFA-SPK), have been approved for 100% SAF use in test flights. Recent trials conducted by Boeing, Airbus, and commercial airlines have demonstrated that 100% SAF can be used without engine modifications, showcasing its potential for full replacement of fossil-based jet fuel in the future [22]. However, full regulatory approval for commercial 100% SAF use is still under review, requiring further studies on long-term engine performance, emissions impact, and fuel supply scalability.

Higher blending ratios have been shown to improve combustion efficiency and reduce emissions. Studies indicate that increasing the proportion of sustainable fuel in the blend leads to lower particulate matter and sulfur oxide emissions, primarily due to the absence of aromatics and sulfur compounds in alternative fuel sources [22]. This reduction in particulate emissions also decreases the formation of contrails, which contribute to radiative forcing and climate impact. Research has demonstrated that using 100% alternative fuel can reduce ice crystal formation in contrails by up to 50%, significantly mitigating its environmental effects [22].

Despite these benefits, challenges remain in achieving higher blending percentages beyond current regulatory limits. Studies suggest that blends exceeding 50% may require modifications to fuel systems, seals, and combustion dynamics, necessitating further research and certification efforts before widespread adoption [22]. Additionally, fuel composition variability across different production pathways may impact overall engine performance and material compatibility [22].

4.2 Lifecycle Carbon Footprint and Sustainability Metrics

Assessing the environmental impact of sustainable fuels requires a comprehensive life cycle analysis (LCA), often referred to as a “well-to-wake” assessment. This evaluation considers all stages of the fuel’s production and use, including feedstock cultivation, refining, distribution, and combustion in aircraft engines [23]. LCA studies suggest that well-established production pathways, such as hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50–80% compared to conventional fossil fuels [23]. However, the actual carbon savings depend heavily on the type of feedstock used. For instance, HEFA fuels derived from used cooking oil (UCO) or animal fats result in higher emission reductions than those sourced from palm or soybean oil, which have greater land-use change impacts [24].

Beyond carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, the impact of sustainable fuel on non-CO₂ emissions, such as nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) and water vapor emissions, is a crucial consideration. Research indicates that using sustainable aviation fuel reduces soot particle emissions, leading to fewer contrail ice crystals and a lower overall climate-warming effect [22]. Since contrails contribute significantly to aviation-induced climate change, reducing their formation is a major advantage of shifting to higher blending ratios [23].

However, the effectiveness of different production pathways varies. While PtL fuels can theoretically achieve near-zero lifecycle emissions when produced using renewable electricity and carbon capture, their actual impact depends on the energy source for electrolysis and CO₂ sourcing method. If 100% renewable electricity (e.g., wind, solar, or hydropower) is used, and CO₂ is sourced from direct air capture (DAC) or biogenic emissions, PtL fuels can approach full carbon neutrality. In contrast, if the electrolysis process is powered by fossil-fuel-based electricity, the overall emissions can be significantly higher, reducing the climate benefits of PtL fuels [25]. Similarly, the ATJ pathway exhibits a wide range of carbon reduction potential (60–85%), largely dependent on the feedstock source. ATJ fuels derived from sugarcane-based ethanol tend to have lower emissions, whereas corn-based ethanol—which requires higher land and energy inputs—results in higher associated emissions [26]. To provide a comparative overview, Table 2 summarizes the lifecycle carbon footprint reductions of different SAF pathways, highlighting their potential GHG savings under optimal conditions.

5. Scaling Challenges and Economic Concerns

The scalability of SAF production is significantly constrained by the availability and sustainability of suitable feedstocks. Current primary feedstocks, such as waste oils and fats, are limited in supply and face competition from other industries, leading to potential supply chain bottlenecks. For instance, the finite availability of used cooking oil and animal fats restricts the volume of SAF that can be produced through the HEFA pathway. Additionally, the cultivation of energy crops raises concerns regarding land use, water consumption, and potential impacts on food security, necessitating careful consideration to avoid adverse environmental and social effects [27]. To mitigate these challenges, research is focusing on alternative feedstocks, such as lignocellulosic biomass, municipal solid waste, and algae, which offer greater abundance and sustainability. However, the development of efficient and cost-effective technologies to convert these feedstocks into SAF remains a significant hurdle. Advancements in biochemical and thermochemical conversion processes are essential to unlock the potential of these alternative feedstocks and enable large-scale SAF production [28].

SAF’s economic viability is another critical factor influencing its adoption in the aviation industry. Currently, SAF production costs are substantially higher than those of conventional jet fuel, primarily due to the high costs associated with feedstock procurement, processing technologies, and the scale of production facilities. Estimates suggest that SAF can be two to three times more expensive than traditional jet fuel, posing a significant barrier to widespread adoption [29]. Economies of scale play a pivotal role in reducing production costs. As production volumes increase, unit costs are expected to decrease, making SAF more competitive with conventional fuels. Policy interventions, such as subsidies, tax incentives, and carbon pricing mechanisms, are also crucial in bridging the cost gap and encouraging investment in SAF production infrastructure. For example, government initiatives that provide financial support for SAF producers can enhance economic feasibility and stimulate market growth.

The existing fuel infrastructure is predominantly designed for fossil-based jet fuels, presenting challenges for the integration of SAF. Modifications to transportation, storage, and refueling systems may be necessary to accommodate SAF’s unique properties and ensure compatibility with current aviation operations. Additionally, the geographic distribution of SAF production facilities relative to major airports can impact logistics and supply chain efficiency. Establishing a robust distribution network is essential to facilitate the widespread adoption of SAF [27]. Collaborative efforts among stakeholders, including fuel producers, airlines, airport operators, and policymakers, are vital to address these infrastructure challenges. Developing standardized protocols and investing in infrastructure upgrades can streamline SAF integration into the existing fuel supply chain, thereby supporting the scaling of SAF utilization in the aviation sector [28]. Additionally, policy and regulatory frameworks can significantly influence the development and deployment of SAF. Supportive policies, such as blending mandates, tax credits, and research funding, can create a favorable environment for SAF advancement. For instance, the European Union has implemented the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which sets a minimum supply mandate for SAF in Europe, starting with 2% in 2025 and increasing to 70% by 2050 [31]. However, policy uncertainty and inconsistent regulations across different regions can pose challenges for investors and producers. Coordinating policies and establishing long-term regulatory commitments are essential to providing the stability needed for substantial investments in SAF production capacity [32].

6. Future Works

Advancing SAF necessitates addressing current limitations in catalyst efficiency, feedstock sustainability, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Enhancing catalyst performance is pivotal for improving SAF production efficiency. Emerging materials, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and single-atom catalysts, have shown promise in increasing reaction rates and selectivity in processes like FT synthesis and ATJ conversion. For instance, MOFs with tailored pore structures facilitate better access to active sites, thereby improving hydrocarbon yield. However, challenges related to catalyst stability and scalability under industrial conditions persist. Current research focuses on doping strategies and support modifications to enhance catalyst durability and performance [33].

In bioengineering, genetically modified microorganisms are being developed to optimize metabolic pathways for higher lipid production, serving as efficient feedstocks for SAF. For example, engineered strains of Yarrowia lipolytica have demonstrated increased lipid accumulation through the overexpression of specific genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. Despite these advancements, issues such as genetic stability and process scalability remain. Ongoing studies aim to refine genetic constructs and fermentation conditions to achieve consistent, high-yield lipid production suitable for industrial applications [34].

Optimizing the entire SAF production process is crucial for economic viability and environmental impact reduction. Integrating advanced pretreatment methods, such as steam explosion and torrefaction, can enhance biomass reactivity, leading to higher conversion efficiencies. Additionally, process intensification techniques, including the use of reactive distillation and membrane reactors, are being explored to streamline production steps and reduce energy consumption. However, challenges in process integration and control need to be addressed to fully realize these benefits [35].

Diversifying feedstock sources is essential to ensure a sustainable and resilient supply chain for SAF production. Non-edible oilseed crops, such as camelina and carinata, are gaining attention due to their low agricultural input requirements and compatibility with existing farming practices. For instance, field trials of camelina have shown its potential as a rotation crop, providing both economic and soil health benefits. Nevertheless, considerations regarding land use change and indirect environmental impacts must be carefully managed. Research is ongoing to assess the lifecycle emissions of these feedstocks and develop best practices for their cultivation and harvesting [36].

Lastly, securing adequate funding is critical to supporting the research, development, and commercialization of SAF technologies. Government grants, private investments, and public-private partnerships play vital roles in financing these initiatives. Policy instruments, such as tax incentives and carbon pricing, can further stimulate investment by improving the economic competitiveness of SAFs. For instance, the implementation of a carbon offset and reduction scheme for international aviation (CORSIA) aims to incentivize the adoption of lower-carbon fuels. Nonetheless, uncertainties in policy frameworks and market dynamics pose risks to sustained funding. Continuous engagement with policymakers and stakeholders is necessary to develop stable and supportive financial mechanisms [37].

7. Conclusion

SAFs provide a promising pathway for reducing aviation-related carbon emissions while maintaining compatibility with existing fuel infrastructure. This review explored key SAF feedstocks, including algae, waste biomass, and PtL fuels, as well as major conversion pathways such as HEFA, ATJ, and FT synthesis. While SAF technologies have demonstrated viability, challenges related to feedstock availability, production scalability, and economic feasibility persist. Advancements in catalyst optimization, process integration, and emerging electrochemical approaches offer potential solutions to improve fuel yield and reduce costs. Additionally, policy frameworks and financial incentives will play important roles in accelerating SAF adoption. Continued research into novel feedstocks, improved conversion processes, and infrastructure development is necessary to support the widespread implementation of SAFs as a long-term solution for decarbonizing the aviation industry.

Qatar Airways, Virgin Australia get green light for strategic alliance

Qatar Airways Group and Virgin Australia have secured final approval from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) for their integrated alliance, marking a major milestone in Virgin Australia's return to long-haul international travel. This green light paves the way for the airline's 28 weekly flights between Australia and Doha, operated under a wet-lease agreement with Qatar Airways, to commence as planned.

The partnership grants Virgin Australia access to the extensive network and expertise of Qatar Airways, enhancing competition in the aviation market while offering Australian travellers increased choice and value. Beginning in June 2025, Virgin Australia will launch flights from Sydney, Brisbane and Perth to Doha, with Melbourne services set to follow in December 2025. These flights will seamlessly connect passengers via Doha's Hamad International Airport to over 100 destinations across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

Travellers will also benefit from enhanced loyalty opportunities, with expanded earning and redemption privileges for members of Qatar Airways' Privilege Club and Virgin Australia's Velocity programme. The alliance is expected to generate an estimated AU$3 billion in economic value over the next five years, significantly boosting Australia's tourism and aviation sectors.

Further strengthening ties, Qatar Airways will offer secondment opportunities to 20 Virgin Australia pilots and 40 cabin crew in 2025, supporting employment growth. The partnership will also focus on sustainability initiatives, including the development of sustainable aviation fuel.

This agreement follows the Australian Government's recent approval of Qatar Airways' 25% investment in Virgin Australia, solidifying its commitment to the airline's growth alongside existing majority shareholder Bain Capital. With this strategic collaboration, both airlines are poised to redefine long-haul travel for Australian passengers.

It is now laying the groundwork in leading the production and usage of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with its agricultural waste feedstock, which is expected to meet the country's jet fuel demand and capacity to export.

During the recent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Forum, the Philippine Department of Transportation (DOTr) partnered with major global aerospace company, Boeing to drive SAF adoption through collaboration with aviation stakeholders.

According to the DOTr, the country has sufficient agricultural waste feedstock to meet all national jet fuel consumption needs with even potential for exports.

“The success of the SAF Forum underscores our commitment to a sustainable aviation sector,” DOTr officials said. “By fostering innovation and partnerships, we are paving the way for the Philippines to become a leader in SAF production and usage.”

Beyond environmental benefits, the SAF initiative is expected to generate jobs, strengthen the local supply chain, and build expertise in sustainable fuel production.

The forum pushed to fast-track aviation’s carbon footprint reduction through SAF, which is a key lever to decarbonising aviation. SAF has the potential to lower emissions by up to 80% compared with conventional jet fuel, according to industry experts.

SAF adoption in ASEAN

Southeast Asia’s feedstocks can supply approximately 12% of global SAF demand to meet the commercial aviation industry’s net-zero goal by 2050, according to a report by Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) and supported by Boeing.

The study showed that the Philippines and its ASEAN neighbours Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia’s total feedstock availability accounts for about 90% of the region’s SAF supply capacity.

Meanwhile, the Association of Asia-Pacific Airlines (AAPA) targets using 5% SAF blend by 2030.

Launched at the forum was the Island Skies Alliance (ISA), consisting of SAF and NbS (Nature-based Solutions) stakeholders such as the Air Carriers Association of the Philippines (ACAP). Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific Air and AsiaAir are ACAP members.

ISA has set the goal of 1% blend by 2030 for Philippine operations.

However, scaling up SAF production comes with challenges. Aviation expert and SAF investor Tina DiCicco cautioned that higher ticket prices are inevitable.

“Singapore, for instance, is the first country to impose a sustainable fuel levy beginning 2026. This can add between $1 to $16 to a flight ticket,” she said.

Singapore also plans to mandate the use of SAF on all departing flights from 2026, starting with a 1% SAF target. It hopes to increase this target to 3-5% by 2030.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/MC-Asia/uploadedImages/Articles/News/Association_Meetings/fuel-250328.jpeg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-03-28 06:56:25.658747

The EU's push to expand the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has sparked strong backlash from the aviation industry.

On March 27, 17 major European airlines issued a joint statement, arguing that the limited availability and high cost of green fuels are placing a heavy burden on the industry's decarbonization efforts. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) also openly stated that the EU’s SAF targets are simply unattainable.

SAF shortages hinder aviation's path to decarbonization

The 17 airlines, including Ryanair, Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, and the International Airlines Group (IAG), which owns British Airways, have historically been recognized for their sustainability efforts. However, their sudden and vocal criticism of EU policies has drawn significant public attention.

Under the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Initiative, flights departing from EU airports must blend a certain percentage of SAF into their fuel supply. The target for 2024 is set at 2%, increasing to 6% by 2030 and reaching 70% by 2050. However, SAF currently costs three to five times more than conventional jet fuel and accounts for just 0.3% of global aviation fuel supply, posing a major challenge to the industry's decarbonization goals.

The joint statement cited a recent report from Steer Economics, which highlighted the financial burden on members of Airlines for Europe (A4E), the region’s largest airline association. Compliance with regulations has driven costs up by 200% over the past decade, reaching a total of €15 billion (about $16.1 billion USD) by 2024—an amount sufficient to purchase 300 new fuel-efficient aircraft.

European airlines are now calling on the EU to ramp up SAF production or relax regulatory measures to prevent them from falling behind global competitors. IATA Director General Willie Walsh warned, ""We can't just stand back and pretend that these targets are meaningful and can be achieved. They were never going to be capable of being achieved.""

Despite their criticism, airlines reaffirmed their commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Meanwhile, the European Commission remains firm on its SAF targets. EU Transport Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas stated that discussions with airline executives will be arranged to better understand their concerns.

SAF production plans slashed by 50% as costs rise

After U.S. President Donald Trump significantly scaled back climate action, calls from European businesses for the EU to ease sustainability obligations have been growing. Stricter emissions regulations for the automotive industry have already been delayed, and the aviation sector is also hoping for a reprieve.

Besides, A new Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report has raised further concerns about SAF supply shortages. According to the report, under current industry trends, SAF production will be insufficient to meet airline decarbonization targets by 2030. Bio-based SAF (Bio-SAF) is expected to fall 30% short of demand, while synthetic SAF (e-SAF) will require a 45% increase in production to meet targets.

BCG surveyed 200 aviation suppliers with over 500 senior executives, finding that rising energy and operational costs have forced SAF production plans to be cut by 50 to 70%. Slow regulatory approvals and economic uncertainty have also led many companies in the SAF supply chain to adopt a wait-and-see approach.

The report suggests that in addition to regulatory mandates, carbon pricing could help bridge the price gap between fossil fuels and SAF. By creating financial incentives, carbon pricing could drive demand and encourage long-term investment in SAF production.",https://reccessary.com/data/news/cover/1743138894175956961.png,N,,2025-03-28 04:56:13.269505

How does the market and environment for renewable fuels today compare with when you started?

Their neighbors to the north in Oregon and Washington have implemented similar programs with the low carbon fuel standards.
New York City also just implemented renewable diesel in their ferry fleet, so those famous Staten Island ferries are now using renewable diesel.","By Dusty Sonnenberg, CCA, Field Leader, a project of the Ohio Soybean Council and Soybean Check-off

Clean Fuels Alliance America (Clean Fuels), previously known as the National Biodiesel Board, is the national trade association representing the biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel industries. The organization is based in Jefferson City, Mo., and is partly a soybean check-off funded initiative. Clean Fuels works to create sustainable industry growth through education, communication, governmental affairs, and technical and quality assurance programs. Clean Fuels works as the coordinating body for research and development in the United States, comprised of state, national and international feedstock and feedstock processor organizations, fuel suppliers, fuel marketers, distributors and technology providers.

Tom Verry serves as Director of Outreach and Development for the organization. The Ohio Field Leader (OFL) had the opportunity to catch-up with Verry during Commodity Classic and get an update on some of the positive momentum that Clean Fuels is experiencing currently.

OFL – You have been in this industry for nearly three decades. There has been a lot of excitement and serious discussions regarding the growing demand for renewable fuels in the past few years. How does the market and environment for renewable fuels today compare with when you started?

Verry – The exciting part or the supply/demand equation in our industry right now is on the demand side. I’ve been around for 30 years, and I have never seen the opportunity look so good for biodiesel as I do today. We are seeing new industries looking to use biodiesel to help decarbonize their supply chain.

OFL – Are there any specific companies or examples that show promise?

Verry – Ohio is a great example. Madison Corby with the Ohio Soybean Council is working with our petroleum team on some Great Lakes shipping companies to get biodiesel in their Great Lakes fleet of ships. We are also working with the class one railroads like Norfolk Southern. They have all committed to decarbonization goals and they see biodiesel as the fuel they want to use to reach those carbon goals. They want to get to 20% biodiesel blends in a relatively short period of time. They are looking at a time frame of five to six years from now, and the reality is that they just started at 3%.

Another example is the home heating oil market in the Northeast. We see train loads of biodiesel leave the Midwest head to the Northeast to supply them with bioheat. There is a lot of pressure to decarbonize their home heat industry. Their options are petroleum heating oil, (which is very common), or switching to air source heat pumps. If a home does not have a heat pump, retrofitting the heating system can cost anywhere from $25,000-$30,000. On the other hand, if they switch from petroleum heating oil to using biodiesel, then they just change the fuel type and do not need to replace the entire heating system.

OFL – You mentioned carbon goals. Low carbon seems to be a buzz phrase. How does the idea of low carbon apply to the fuel industry and increasing demand?

Verry – In the industry we talk a lot about the low carbon fuel standards. Currently the low carbon demand is more of a west coast market. With that said, it is currently about half of our demand, and California has led that.

When we talk about the low carbon fuel standards, it basically means that they are trying to decarbonize their economies, and the low carbon fuel standard is focused on transportation. We have seen California as the leader. Currently they are at 75% biodiesel and renewable diesel. That is 75% of the diesel market, and California is the #2 diesel market in the country behind Texas. Their neighbors to the north in Oregon and Washington have implemented similar programs with the low carbon fuel standards. Oregon is at 40% of the diesel pool and Washington is at about 20% use. The newest entry is New Mexico. It is one of the biggest big oil states in the country and they are going to start implementing low carbon fuel standards.

Everyone is looking at new and different technologies to meet the low carbon fuel standards. Often, they see electric vehicles (EV’s) playing a big role. They can do a great job in certain segments but in the heavy-duty truck and transportation industries, it is just not quite there yet. That really provides an opportunity for us. I don’t know if we are ever going to see an electric ore carrier or other shipping vessel on the Great Lakes. I do know that until they figure it out, I think there is a lot of opportunity for biodiesel.

OFL – How do farmers’ soybean check-off dollars help move the needle in the discussions with state governments as they look at decarbonization options?

Verry – Because of support from the check-off we can generate the data needed to have the discussions which are backed up by that data with the states considering their low carbon initiatives. With that data, we can make a convincing case that biodiesel and renewable diesel can play an important role in reaching their goals.

New York City is an exciting example. New York City mapped out a decarbonization strategy 20 years ago. What they plan to do is electrify what vehicles they can, and then with what they can’t, they are going to put biodiesel and renewable diesel in. That is where they are today. They have 12,000 diesel vehicles. It is the largest municipal fleet in the country, and it is running on 100% renewable diesel and biodiesel blends. That includes their fire department (FDNY) and also the police department (NYPD) and the sanitation departments. They are all running on blends of biodiesel and renewable diesel.

New York City also just implemented renewable diesel in their ferry fleet, so those famous Staten Island ferries are now using renewable diesel. In the near future they want to convert to using bioheat in all their school buildings.",https://ocj.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Clean-Fuel.png,N,,2025-03-28 07:56:42.148357

The pre-feasibility study will explore the application of Licella's advanced manufacturing technology to produce a bio-intermediate (renewable oil) from wood residues.
This bio-intermediate will then be refined into SAF, bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel, establishing a domestic supply chain based on local production and consumption.","To revolutionize sustainable fuel production in Japan, Marubeni Corporation, Japan Airlines (JAL), Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, Chugoku Lumber Co., Ltd., Boeing Japan KK, and Obayashi Corporation have announced a joint memorandum of understanding (MoU) for a pre-feasibility study of SAF. The focus of this study is the commercialization of SAF, bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel derived from domestic forest residues.

This initiative addresses the growing urgency to reduce carbon dioxide emissions within the aviation and chemical industries. Japan, possessing abundant forest resources, is poised to leverage thinning materials and wood processing residues as sustainable raw materials. The increasing adoption of wood in large-scale construction further amplifies the potential for utilizing these residues.

The aviation industry, grappling with the imperative to decarbonize, views SAF as a critical solution. However, a stable domestic supply chain, encompassing raw material sourcing, production, and utilization, is essential to meet the anticipated surge in SAF demand from 2030 onwards. Similarly, the chemical industry is actively pursuing greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies, transitioning to sustainable feedstocks like biochemical products from biomass and chemically recycled plastics to achieve carbon neutrality and a circular economy.

The pre-feasibility study will explore the application of Licella's advanced manufacturing technology to produce a bio-intermediate (renewable oil) from wood residues. This bio-intermediate will then be refined into SAF, bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel, establishing a domestic supply chain based on local production and consumption. The study will meticulously assess the economic viability of this business model, including raw material supply and processing systems, manufacturing processes, product logistics, and CO2 emission reduction effectiveness.

The consortium aims to complete the pre-feasibility study by December 2025. The ultimate goal is to achieve commercialization around 2030, contingent on the study's progress. This ambitious project signifies a significant step towards a sustainable future for both the aviation and chemical industries in Japan.

The collaboration brings together the expertise of diverse industry leaders: Marubeni's global trading and project development capabilities, JAL's aviation operational experience, Mitsubishi Chemical's chemical manufacturing prowess, Chugoku Lumber's forestry and wood processing expertise, Boeing's aviation technology leadership, and Obayashi's construction and sustainable infrastructure development expertise.

This initiative underscores Japan's commitment to developing innovative and sustainable solutions that contribute to global efforts in combating climate change. By harnessing domestic forest resources and leveraging advanced technologies, the consortium aims to establish a robust and sustainable fuel supply chain, paving the way for a greener future.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-03-28 04:56:18.188501

The need for feedstock diversity

Many SAF projects struggle with feedstocks that are too expensive, too scarce, or both.

Today SAF is overwhelmingly produced using the hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) process, which converts waste fats, oils and greases from sources like used cooking oil and animal fats. (Some synthetic jet fuel is also produced via the HEFA process using crop-based feeds like canola and soybean oil, but because such feeds...

This marks LRQA’s fifth acquisition in five months, reinforcing its commitment to accelerating growth and expanding its support for global corporate clients navigating the energy transition.

EcoEngineers was recently recognized globally as a Top 10 Sustainable Consulting Firms by Sustainability Magazine, and offers deep technical expertise in low-carbon fuel production, climate regulations, carbon markets and innovative technologies – areas in high demand amid growing regulatory complexity and uncertainty.

Against this backdrop, businesses still have to respond to pressures from investors, consumers and stakeholders to uphold transparency and integrity in their climate commitments, particularly in the agriculture and energy sectors.

As a result, many are turning to low-carbon fuels such as biofuels, renewable natural gas (RNG) and hydrogen to decarbonise operations. Businesses therefore need specialist guidance on these fuels, the corresponding regulations – such as California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) – and the enabling technologies. This acquisition directly addresses those needs.

This initiative is designed to bridge supply and demand gaps, providing a scalable and adaptable pathway to increase SAF usage across the aviation industry.

Julien Manhes, Head of SAF and Carbon Dioxide Removals at Airbus emphasized the importance of the new system by saying: “Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market. For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to SAF can be challenging depending on the amount of SAF needed.

Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and derisk the process for operators and SAF suppliers, by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them. This is also a great opportunity to demonstrate Book and Claim is reliable and that its usage should be extended in voluntary and regulatory markets.”

Industry Leaders Join Forces for Sustainable Aviation Fuel Growth

To kickstart the initiative, Airbus has secured a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with leading aviation companies, including SMBC Aviation Capital, AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment, and SAF Aerogroup. These organizations have expressed strong interest in supporting the program, reinforcing a collective industry effort to accelerate SAF integration.

SMBC Aviation Capital, a leading global aircraft leasing company, has demonstrated a strong commitment to sustainability through various initiatives. In January 2024, the company announced a partnership with Trinity College Dublin to establish the Trinity College Dublin SAF Research Facility at SMBC Aviation Capital’s new headquarters in Dublin.

In addition to research collaborations, SMBC Aviation Capital launched a sector-leading sustainability solution for airlines in September 2022. The company invested $53.3 million in high-quality carbon credit programs aligned with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. This initiative provides airline customers with access to carbon credits as part of lease agreements or independently, supporting their net-zero ambitions by 2050. The carbon credits are derived from energy-efficient cookstove projects in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, contributing to both environmental and social benefits.

How the Airbus “Book and Claim” Model Works

Under this system, buyers can purchase SAF credits, securing the environmental benefits of using the fuel without needing to physically transport it to their location. Instead, the SAF is consumed elsewhere, while buyers receive certification of their contribution to emission reductions. This allows for a more flexible and efficient distribution of SAF, ensuring broader market access.

To implement the system, Airbus will procure SAF certificates and oversee their management through the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a globally recognized sustainability certification entity. These certificates will then be resold to interested aviation customers, including aircraft and helicopter operators, stimulating demand and ensuring verified sustainability benefits.

The pilot program, set to run through 2025, aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the “Book and Claim” framework. Airbus will assess the market response, the reliability of this approach, and the potential role of third-party facilitation in expanding SAF availability. This initiative is expected to generate valuable insights that will help shape future SAF integration strategies across the aviation industry.

Passed in 2022, the IRA supercharged subsidies and tax credits for all types of energy technologies, including renewables, sustainable aviation fuel, nuclear power, and electric vehicles. The bill also gave oil and gas companies access to $500 billion in new tax credits, according to the tax firm Baker Tilly. So far, the IRA's subsidies have largely benefited wealthy households and large corporations.

The Congressional Budget Office initially projected the IRA to cost $370 billion over 10 years, but the price of the bill's energy and climate provisions has steadily climbed since. A recent report by Travis Fisher and Joshua Loucks of the Cato Institute estimates that the IRA's tax credits and subsidies will cost taxpayers $936 billion to $1.97 trillion in 10 years and between $2.04 trillion and $4.67 trillion by 2050. Tax returns already signal a higher bill than anticipated. Tax credits for residential clean energy and energy efficiency, which were originally estimated to cost $459 million in 2023, ended up costing $8.4 billion that year.

One of the most expensive provisions of the bill is its clean electricity investment and production tax credits, which have no set expiration date and will sunset when a 25 percent reduction (compared to 2022 levels) in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the electricity sector is achieved. As the report points out, growing power demand and the Trump administration's rollback of regulations will slow down or even stall decarbonization of the grid, leaving taxpayers on the hook to pay for these credits indefinitely. Cato says these two credits will ""likely cost taxpayers between $70 billion and $180 billion per year in the years just before the GHG target is met.""

Costs aside, the IRA, which has been heralded as the largest climate bill in history, does a poor job of reducing GHG emissions. Cato estimates that the bill's provisions will reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at a cost of $224 to $535 per ton. Tree planting and natural regeneration, meanwhile, can reduce CO2 emissions at a price of $23 per ton.

Despite the bill's ballooning costs and inefficient GHG reductions, a repeal of IRA spending, which would require full Republican support, is unlikely. Recently, 21 House Republicans signed a letter in support of keeping the bill's tax credits.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/03/3-27-25-v1-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 17:56:48.678674

Space4Climate: the launch of the UK’s first Biomass Climate Satellite Mission at the conference

Space4Climate is a UK-based initiative chaired by the UK Space Agency, uniting members from across government, industry and academia. With a working date of April 29th, during the Congress, Space4Climate hopes to screen live the launch of the Biomass Climate Satellite, which will provide a new way of monitoring Tropical Forests around the world. The Biomass Climate Satellite Mission, a UK-conceived mission, led by the European Space Agency UK’s expertise, will drastically reduce the current uncertainty regarding the amount of carbon stored in forests and how this changes with time, providing vital information to support decision making around climate change.

It will be a landmark achievement for the UK space sector, and a massive step for global climate monitoring.

Beth Greenaway, Chair of Space4Climate and Head of Earth Observation and Climate at UK Space Agency, said:

“The ESA Biomass mission launch is an exciting milestone. UK experts in our universities and industry, in collaboration with teams across Europe have led the build of this world first P-band mission. It is innovation in the instruments we can deploy to space that will provide a vital tool in the strive for management of our planet and the drive to net zero.”

Prof John Remedios, Director of the National Centre for Earth Observation, said:

“The BIOMASS mission is an exciting venture to explore and characterise the carbon stored in tropical forests in detail. Underpinned by UK science and technology expertise in collaboration with colleagues across Europe, this European Space Agency satellite will revolutionise our ability to understand global net carbon balance and predict future land carbon change with greater confidence.”

LanzaJet: Driving sustainable aviation fuel innovation with alcohol-to-jet fuel technology

There have been many developments in the world of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in recent years, but perhaps none quite so pivotal as Lanzajet’s patented Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology. By converting Ethanol into SAF, LanzaJet has become the first SAF company to deliver a fully drop-in, non-oil based fuel solution for the airline industry. The company opened the world’s first commercial demonstration AtJ production plant in Georgia, USA last year, and was named as one of TIME100’s Most Influential Companies for 2024.

The company has now recently announced that it has selected Teesside, UK for its second commercial production site, which will create 30 skilled jobs, in partnership with Sembcorp Utilities (UK) Limited and British Airways. The fuel produced is expected to reduce the net carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 230,000 tonnes per year — equivalent to 26,000 British Airways UK domestic flights.

Daniel Bloch, Director of Partnerships at LanzaJet, said:

“LanzaJet is the first company to construct a commercial-scale demonstration facility for the ATJ SAF pathway, delivered at our Freedom Pines Fuels facility in the town of Soperton, GA, USA. Building off this development, we’ve just announced that our second commercial-scale facility, Project Speedbird, will be based in Teesside’s Wilton International, together with our partners Sembcorp Utilities (UK) Limited and British Airways,” said Daniel Bloch, Director of Partnerships at LanzaJet.

“As we continue to build out our presence among local stakeholders and industry collaborators, working toward the UK Government's SAF Mandate objectives, we cannot wait to exhibit at Innovation Zero World Congress. We look forward to strengthening our connections across the UK SAF and Net Zero network, with Innovation Zero providing an exceptional platform to engage with the key players central to driving our broader energy transition goals. We look forward to meeting you!”

Carbon Neutral Fuels: Driving investment in green e-fuel production technology and tackling emissions

Carbon Neutral Fuels is a UK-based start-up, which was formed by Sophie Zienkiewicz and Alasdair Lumsden, after they met at COP26 in 2021, and were united by their shared vision to pioneer a modular and scalable ‘Power-to-Liquid’ e-fuel production technology, which can be rapidly deployed close to where sustainable fuels are needed.

Hexagon has sponsored this post.

As global markets trend towards sustainable, net-zero economies, aviation finds itself at a crossroads. For decades, airplane geometries have converged. They all contain a large, pressurized tube; massive, petrol-filled wings and a half-dozen-or-so jet — maybe propeller — engines. Interiors have new creature comforts, space saving methodologies and lighter materials, but for generations development has stagnated. Aziz Tahiri, vice president of Global Industries Aerospace & Defense at Hexagon, argues that for the industry to align with sustainability trends, everything must change.

“You have to review everything in an aircraft to be sustainable,” says Tahiri. “Almost everything was designed 40 years ago. You need to reconsider all these systems. This is hard because of the economics and financial systems attached to it. You need to almost reinvent everything, and new product introduction costs a lot of money.”

The obvious first step is to change aircraft power systems. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hybrid and electric systems, green hydrogen fuel cell systems are leading candidates, but which should be selected and how will this selection affect aircraft geometry? Designing, testing and manufacturing the prototypes to answer these questions — while maintaining best practices — will get expensive and time consuming.

“We need to rethink the aircraft without spending ten years to design a new aircraft,” explains Tahiri. “To spend $12 billion to design an aircraft; you need to produce thousands over ten years to break even. We need to reduce the design cycle time to test new materials, fuel and designs to get a new aircraft in six years and maybe $6 billion.”

So, what technologies will make the aircraft industry sustainable: new fuels, batteries, fuel cells? One, or a combination, will inevitably come out on top. But it will be new technologies for high fidelity 3D simulation, traceability and advanced manufacturing that get us there.

How high fidelity 3Dsimulation can make flying green

Simulation technology is by no means new to the aerospace industry. For decades it has been used to validate the structural integrity of components, aerodynamics strategies, test new materials and assess propulsion strategies. What has changed is its accuracy and time to results; this should change how it’s used.

“Yesterday you could not avoid prototyping several times — even up to 3-6 prototypes — and the engineering teams were using simulation to test and validate them more extensively. Today with efficient large model processing, it’s much easier to iterate with an accurate 3D or system model in the virtual world. So maybe you only need to prototype once to find out if what you make works as designed,” says Tahiri. “That is what we do at Hexagon. We have simulations so close to reality and physical testing we can avoid multiple physical tests and iterations.”

The idea is to reduce design cycle times by replacing the use of physical prototypes with digital alternatives and using them extensively earlier in the design phase. This saves a lot of money and time, as building prototypes as large and complex as an aircraft isn’t easy.

Tahiri explains that this iterative process is becoming even faster thanks to the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The use of AI can significantly reduce the computational time needed to get results. Additionally, AI can be used to suggest iterations to a design, helping engineers zero-in on optimal geometries faster than before.

Using modern simulation and AI, Tahiri suggests engineers start testing:

Aircraft architectures like delta wings, blended wing bodies and adjustable wingtips.

Biomimicry to see how bird and insect flight might influence and optimize aerodynamics.

The performance of materials like composites, and components made via additive manufacturing.

Propulsion and storage strategies for hydrogen, batteries and fuel cells.

How 3D model traceability tools bring sustainability to aviation

Like simulation, traceability is not new to the aviation industry. Since aviation’s inception, documentation has helped design, certify and justify aircraft designs. What has changed is that traceability is no longer a manual endeavor — almost everything can be digitalized efficiently and accurately.

“You once had an army of inspectors to check everything is signed off and manufactured right,” said Tahiri. “Now we are using automated inspection capabilities with laser scanners that digitally send measurements to certification systems. These scanners can ensure traceability all along the product lifecycle. Instead of having a huge amount of paper for inspection reports, you now have a digital report that correlates to a 3D measurement cloud that can be meshed into a CAD model.”

The detailed 3D measurements add a critical “source of truth” to the digital twin and ensures all stakeholders collaborate on the same data throughout the product lifecycle. For instance, simulation experts can take the measurements from the manufacturing team to ensure a plane, as built, meets sustainability requirements. These geometries can also be used to help process development teams make the manufacturing processes more sustainable — by reducing scrap, for example.

How manufacturing must change to make aerospace sustainable

Since development teams can iterate on a design to reduce scrap, it stands to reason they can iterate on designs to ensure manufacturability — or better still, optimise it virtually before any CAPEX is committed. “Before you certify a new design, you need to make sure it is manufacturable,” Tahiri confirms. “This usually happens after the design of the aircraft. However, we can now simulate the manufacturing processes before a design is signed off and certified.”

This means that — well before any assembling, drilling or fastening — development teams can assess if a design can be manufactured ­and if said manufacturing process meets sustainability goals. “If you engineer something but you can’t manufacture it, or it takes re-engineering every time you do, the ROI is ten years instead of five and the engineering fails,” says Tahiri. “Well-engineered products can be manufactured, and the processes are optimized for quality, cost, sustainability and time to market.”",https://www.engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_484970881-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-03-27 14:56:24.596823

UK GHG emissions fell by 4pc in 2024

London, 27 March (Argus) — The UK's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions fell by 4pc year-on-year in 2024, provisional data released by the government today show, driven principally by lower gas and coal use in the power and industry sectors. GHG emissions in the UK totalled 371mn t of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) last year, the data show, representing a fall of 54pc compared with 1990 levels. The UK has legally-binding targets to cut its GHG emissions by 68pc by 2030 and 81pc by 2035 against 1990 levels, and to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The electricity sector posted the largest proportional year-on-year fall of 15pc, standing 82pc below 1990 levels at 37.5mn t CO2e. The decline was largely a result of record-high net imports and a 7pc increase in renewable output reducing the call on coal and gas-fired generation, as well as the closure of the country's last coal power plant in September , which together outweighed a marginal rise in overall electricity demand, the government said. Industry posted the next largest emissions decline of 9pc, falling to 48.3mn t CO2e, or 69pc below 1990 levels, as a result of lower coal use across sectors and the closure of iron and steel blast furnaces. Fuel supply emissions fell by 6pc to 28.4mn t CO2e, 63pc below where they stood in 1990. And emissions in the UK's highest-emitting sector, domestic transport, fell by 2pc to 110.1mn t CO2e, 15pc below 1990 levels, as road vehicle diesel use declined. Emissions in the remaining sectors, including agriculture, waste and land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF), edged down collectively by 1pc to 67.2mn t CO2e, some 50pc below 1990 levels. Only emissions from buildings and product uses increased on the year, rising by 2pc as gas use increased, but still standing 27pc below 1990 levels at 79.8mn t CO2e. UK-based international aviation emissions, which are not included in the overall UK GHG figures, rose by 9pc last year to reach pre-Covid 19 pandemic levels of 26.1mn t CO2e, the data show. But UK-based international shipping emissions edged down by 1pc to 6.2mn t CO2e. By Victoria Hatherick Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

Trump unveils new tariffs on auto imports: Update

Adds details throughout Washington, 26 March (Argus) — President Donald Trump said today he would impose a 25pc tariff on foreign-made cars and trucks imported into the US, but said there will be no tariffs on automobiles assembled in the US. Trump said the new tariffs on imported automobiles marked the ""beginning of Liberation Day"", the term Trump has used to reference his plan to unveil sweeping tariffs on major foreign trade partners on 2 April. The White House estimates the tariff on imported cars and trucks will generate $100bn/yr in new tariff revenue. Trump said the auto tariff will go into effect on 2 April, providing a financial incentive for automakers to relocate manufacturing to the US. ""We'll effectively be charging a 25pc tariff, but if you build your car in the United States, there's no tariff,"" Trump said in remarks at the White House. ""And what that means is a lot of foreign car companies, a lot of companies, are going to be in great shape."" The auto tariffs will likely add thousands of dollars to the price of many imported cars and trucks. But the tariffs — the details of which have yet to be released — appears more targeted than Trump's initial plan to impose a 25pc tariff on nearly all imports from Canada and Mexico, because the tariffs would not apply to cars and trucks parts, so long as the vehicles are assembled in the US. ""Anybody that has plants in the United States it's going to be good for, in my opinion,"" Trump said. Ontario premier Doug Ford previously warned that Trump's plan to impose a nearly across-the-board import tariff could have caused auto manufacturing in the US and Canada to grind to a halt within as few as 10 days. Trump eventually delayed those tariffs until 2 April. Earlier this week, Trump said that South Korean automaker Hyundai's decision to invest $5.8bn to build a steel mill in Louisiana offered a blueprint for how companies could avoid tariffs. Trump has already imposed a 25pc tariff on steel and aluminum, and earlier this week said he would announce tariffs on imported lumber, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals. Even as a lack of details about the upcoming tariffs has fueled uncertainty for businesses and sharp declines on US stock markets, Trump has continued to announce additional tariffs. On Tuesday, Trump said any country taking delivery of Venezuelan oil or gas would be ""forced"" to pay an incremental 25pc tariff on any goods imported in the US. US oil executives appear to be growing tired of Trump's chaotic trade policy, particularly his imposition of a 25pc tariff on imported steel that is used in drill pipes, executives said in a survey the US Federal Reserve of Dallas released Wednesday. The uncertainty over tariffs and trade policy is causing ""chaos"", they said in the survey, and increasing their cost of capital. ""Tariff policy is impossible for us to predict and doesn't have a clear goal,"" an unnamed oil executive said in the survey. ""We want more stability.""

Trump to impose new tariffs on auto imports

Washington, 26 March (Argus) — President Donald Trump will announce new tariffs on the automobile industry later today, the White House said, at a time of significant uncertainty about his trade policies. Trump plans to offer further details on the automobile tariffs this afternoon, less than a week before he plans to announce tariffs against major foreign trade partners on 2 April, which Trump has dubbed ""Liberation Day"". Trump has already imposed a 25pc tariff on steel and aluminum, and earlier this week said he would announce tariffs on imported lumber, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals. Trump last month threatened to impose 25pc tariffs on most imports from Canada and Mexico, starting on 4 March — including imported automobiles and vehicle parts — but he eventually offered a one-month reprieve for US automakers before delaying those tariffs entirely until 2 April. The scope and timing of the upcoming automobile tariffs remains unclear, and the White House has yet to provide further details. But Ontario premier Doug Ford previously warned that steep tariffs on Canada could cause auto manufacturing in the US and Canada to grind to a halt within as few as 10 days. Earlier this week, Trump said that South Korean automaker Hyundai's recent decision to invest $5.8bn to build a steel mill in Louisiana offered a blueprint for how companies could avoid tariffs. ""This is the beginning of a lot of things happening,"" Trump said. Even as a lack of details about the upcoming tariffs has fueled uncertainty for businesses and sharp declines on US stock markets, Trump has continued to announce additional tariffs. On Tuesday, Trump said any country taking delivery of Venezuelan oil or gas would be ""forced"" to pay an incremental 25pc tariff on any goods imported in the US. US oil executives appear to be growing tired of Trump's chaotic trade policy, particularly his imposition of a 25pc tariff on imported steel that is used in drill pipes, executives said in a survey the US Federal Reserve of Dallas released Wednesday. The uncertainty over tariffs and trade policy is causing ""chaos"", they said in the survey, and increasing their cost of capital. ""Tariff policy is impossible for us to predict and doesn't have a clear goal,"" an unnamed oil executive said in the survey. ""We want more stability.""

UK eyes 80pc maritime emissions cuts by 2040

London, 26 March (Argus) — The UK is aiming to reduce fuel lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in its domestic shipping by 30pc by 2030 and 80pc by 2040 compared with 2008 levels, reaching zero by 2050. The goals are ""intentionally ambitious"", the UK government said, and will be supported by both domestic and international policy measures as set out in its new maritime decarbonisation strategy. The first phase of the strategy ""will rely on existing IMO regulation"" to improve vessel efficiency this decade, the government said. The second phase will centre on larger vessels. One key policy in the strategy is pricing maritime emissions, which the government expects to do through a combination of pushing for the IMO to introduce a global shipping GHG levy from 2027, and the government's existing plan to extend the UK emissions trading scheme (ETS) to domestic maritime emissions from next year. The government will ""work to understand how these schemes interact, and to avoid any double charging of emissions"", it said. It is still to consider the feedback to its recent consultation on technical elements of the sector's inclusion in the UK ETS, it added. The government also intends to regulate maritime fuel use, both by pushing for IMO-level standards this year on the GHG intensity of fuels, and implementing domestic UK fuel regulations on which it plans to consult in 2026. Calls for evidence were also published alongside the strategy on both potential requirements for zero or near-zero at-berth emissions, with a formal consultation on this planned next year, and on measures to support the decarbonisation of small vessels and targeted maritime sub-sectors. For the latter, the government expects to focus on vessels ""with a clear route to decarbonisation"". ""Measures for harder-to-decarbonise vessels may not be required until the mid-to-late 2030s,"" it said. Maritime emissions accounted for 8pc of the UK's transport emissions in 2022, despite having declined by 30pc compared with 1990 levels, government data show.

In a world shaped by poly-crises, the question we must ask ourselves is: How can the energy transition spark economic growth while addressing global challenges?

Investing in clean energy is investing in economic prosperity

Due to geopolitical tensions, economic shifts and lack of regulatory certainty the energy transition has reached a critical juncture. As a result, strategically important first-of-a-kind (FOAK) projects face challenging business cases, leading to a slowdown in projects reaching final investment decision (FID). To move forward, we must recognize that the energy transition presents a significant opportunity to drive economic growth, job creation, competitiveness, technological innovation and energy security on a global scale.

The business case for clean energy investment

The solutions to decarbonize and improve efficiencies in energy-intensive industries – —such as steel, cement and long-distance transportation – —are available and scalable today. However, large-scale deployment requires new business and partnership models as well as financing mechanisms, and bringing pioneers together to form new, forward-thinking coalitions. It also requires de-risking technologies and projects through pilots and ongoing testing.

If we succeed with that, the energy transition can help boost economic growth:

Creating jobs at scale: Clean energy projects can generate millions of jobs worldwide. According to the Hydrogen Council, the global hydrogen economy alone is expected to create 20-25 million jobs by 20501.

Attracting investments and strengthening local economies: According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), clean energy projects attract foreign capital, improve tax revenue and diversify economies. Fossil-fuel producers are leveraging renewable hydrogen production to transform their energy sector, creating export opportunities and enhancing economic and energy resilience. Montana Renewables is a successful example of how you can revamp a retired fossil fuel unit to a renewable one, maintaining jobs, while creating additional revenues for local farmers.

Transforming industries through innovation: Innovation in clean energy strengthens global competitiveness. For instance, Topsoe’s involvement in Project SkyPower is accelerating e-SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) production in Europe – opening new export opportunities for innovative technologies.Similarly, our collaboration with Vestas and Skovgaard Energy to launch the first-ever green ammonia plant in Ramme, Northwest Jutland, Denmark, showcases how renewable energy can be directly integrated into ammonia production. This approach accounts for fluctuations in power generation, thus offering a cost-effective solution for producing green ammonia.

Maintaining global competitiveness: Regions that fail to invest in clean energy risk losing entire industries to those that move faster in scaling up technologies. Industrial competitiveness depends on securing cost-effective, local and sustainable energy sources. Alternative energy solutions, such as green hydrogen, often come at a higher price, which can deter investors focused on short-term returns. However, the premium cost can also be viewed as an insurance against future price volatility, energy supply risks and industrial decline. Just as companies assess geopolitical risks in their financial models, clean energy investments can be viewed as a safeguard for long-term stability and competitiveness.

New export opportunities: Renewable fuel production enables lower-income countries to shift from exporting raw materials to exporting high-value energy products, fostering industrial development and improving economic conditions. For example, biofuels derived from agricultural waste or residues can create new revenue streams for farming communities while positioning these countries as suppliers of sustainable energy solutions. Additionally, nations with abundant renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind, can leverage green hydrogen and its derivatives as key export commodities - helping to build global clean energy trade while driving local economic growth. In India, for example, Topsoe is partnering with Hygenco to develop a green ammonia plant in Odisha, utilizing its dynamic ammonia technology to convert green hydrogen into ammonia – and enabling the country to export high-value sustainable energy.

Topsoe’s role in boosting economic growth

At Topsoe, we believe that helping energy-intensive industries to decarbonize and become more efficient is central to building a resilient global economy. Our scalable solutions, such as advanced ammonia synthesis technologies and Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell technology for green hydrogen production, empower countries to leverage their renewable resources for localized production. This approach enhances energy resilience, creates new revenue streams, and supports industrial development.

A case on sustainable aviation fuel production: Project SkyPower

Topsoe is part of this CEO led initiative to accelerate the production of sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF). This project will help position Europe as a leader in clean aviation fuel technology and could secure millions of jobs within the aviation industry. They estimate that e-SAF could unlock a EUR 350+ billion global market opportunity and save 400 million tonnes of CO2e annually by 2050, while increasing the EU’s energy resilience.

Beyond its direct impact, e-SAF drives advancements in carbon capture and power-to-X technologies, creating spillover benefits that strengthen Europe’s global competitiveness.

Looking ahead

As the world confronts the complexities of the energy transition, the path forward demands innovation, unwavering collaboration, and scalable solutions. At Topsoe, we are committed to driving this transformation – delivering proven technologies that enable industries to transition toward net-zero while fueling innovation, economic prosperity, and energy security along the way.",https://www.topsoe.com/hubfs/IML-00007602_aRGB_High-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 19:56:44.007097

Through BR Aviation, Vibra has advanced talks with different commercial- and executive-aviation companies for supply, reinforcing its commitments to the energy transition and meeting the growing demand for more sustainable solutions in the aviation sector.
The blending of SAF with conventional aviation fuel will initially be in the proportion of 10 percent SAF and 90 percent fossil fuel, contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions on flights fueled by Vibra with this fuel.
“Vibra has established itself as a pioneer by bringing SAF to Brazil, a product that represents the future of aviation fuel and is aligned with the need for decarbonization in the aviation sector,” Bragança said.
“With a 60 percent market share in the aviation market, we are leaders not only in the sale of fuels but also in the provision of solutions, innovation and sustainability.","Vibra, the largest fuel distributor and one of the largest energy companies in Brazil, announced March 25 that it is taking another important step towards decarbonizing the aviation sector, announcing the availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the country.

The imported biofuel is now available at the base located at Tom Jobim airport (GIG) in Rio de Janeiro, which recently received certification from the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification System GmbH, which guarantees the sustainability tracking of the entire product supply chain—from raw material through production in the biorefinery, to distribution via the base at Tom Jobim airport (Galeão Base), through BR Aviation, Vibra’s business unit for aircraft-refueling services.

With this initiative, Vibra said it not only consolidates itself as the first company in Brazil to import SAF on a commercial scale but also as a pioneer in making the product available for sale in the domestic market.

Through BR Aviation, Vibra has advanced talks with different commercial- and executive-aviation companies for supply, reinforcing its commitments to the energy transition and meeting the growing demand for more sustainable solutions in the aviation sector.

“Being the first company to bring SAF to Brazil on a commercial scale and make this product available to our customers in the domestic market fills us with pride and reinforces our commitment to decarbonization,” said Marcelo Bragança, Vibra’s executive vice president of operations. “We will continue to make efforts to make the Brazilian energy matrix increasingly stronger and more competitive, serving our customers with the fuel they need.”

SAF is produced from renewable sources and reduces greenhouse-gas emissions by approximately 80 percent compared to conventional aviation fuel, contributing to the construction of a cleaner and more sustainable future.

The product made available by Vibra was produced from used cooking oil (UCO), one of the raw materials with the lowest carbon intensity, since it is a residue.

The entire process, from the search for a supplier, import, certifications, to the blending of SAF with fossil-based aviation fuel at Vibra’s base in Galeão took 10 months of planning and execution, starting right after the first book and claim in Latin America was operationalized, also made possible by Vibra in partnership with Gol in June 2024.

This January, 23 isotanks (tank containers) with approximately 550,000 liters (145,295 gallons) of SAF departed from the port of Antwerp, Belgium, bound for Rio de Janeiro, marking what Vibra said is the beginning of a new era for the sustainable fuels market in Brazil.

The blending of SAF with conventional aviation fuel will initially be in the proportion of 10 percent SAF and 90 percent fossil fuel, contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions on flights fueled by Vibra with this fuel.

Vibra said its pioneering work breaks down important barriers and demonstrates the feasibility of adopting SAF in Brazilian aviation, also providing the development of Vibra’s expertise with the blend and later allowing higher percentages to be added to conventional aviation fuel, up to the limit of 50 percent, as currently permitted by international standards.

Vibra said it is prepared to serve all customers interested in purchasing the product, which is already available for sale, and support the decarbonization of their operations.

“Vibra has established itself as a pioneer by bringing SAF to Brazil, a product that represents the future of aviation fuel and is aligned with the need for decarbonization in the aviation sector,” Bragança said. “With a 60 percent market share in the aviation market, we are leaders not only in the sale of fuels but also in the provision of solutions, innovation and sustainability. As leaders, we are prepared to expand the supply of SAF in the Brazilian market, using our infrastructure in more than 90 airports and our expertise to deliver safe and competitive solutions.”

The sustainability of the operation, from raw materials to aircraft refueling at Galeão, was also possible thanks to obtaining ISCC certification for Vibra’s bases in Cubatão and Galeão.

This certification ensures the traceability and sustainability of the biofuels sold by Vibra, opening doors for the company to operate in new markets, both in import and export, based on very strict environmental standards.

Vibra said it has invested significantly in renewable energy, directing more than USD$1.2 billion to this segment.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_4107fbc4e11b41d7a9115916201189b4~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_525,h_311,al_c,lg_1,q_80/80995f_4107fbc4e11b41d7a9115916201189b4~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-03-27 16:57:12.676762

High production costs remain the key barriers to faster adoption of SAF, according to BCG’s findings.

“Despite continuing to scale the availability of sustainable aviation fuel, and we see that trend very clearly, there is a slowdown in the development of projects and even bigger gaps to some of the commitments that some of the companies have made,” said BCG Managing Director and Partner Pelayo Losada, who co-authored the report.

Last year, for example, Shell paused on-site construction work at a biofuels plant in Rotterdam amid weak market conditions. The plant is designed to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel made from waste.

In 2023, Willie Walsh, Director General at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said that the airline industry would be ready to embrace the fact that SAF would always be more expensive than oil-based jet fuel.

IATA said at the end of 2024 that growth in SAF volumes is “disappointingly slow.”

Last year, SAF production volumes reached 1 million tons, double the 500,000 tons produced in 2023. However, SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel production and 11% of global renewable fuel, according to IATA’s latest estimates.

“Investors in new generation fuel producers seem to be waiting for guarantees of easy money before going full throttle,” IATA’s Walsh said.

To reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, IATA analysis shows that between 3,000 and more than 6,500 new renewable fuel plants will be needed.

The annual average capex needed to build the new facilities over the 30-year period is about $128 billion per year, in a best-case scenario, according to IATA.

A transformative energy shift away from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives is therefore essential for buildings, whose operations contribute heavily to global emissions.
Transferring energy Heat pumps (HPs) are critical for achieving net zero targets.
According to the IEA, HPs can potentially remove at least 500 million tons of global carbon dioxide emissions in 203022.
This is primarily due to the significant energy efficiency gains that can be achieved through electrification of economic activities.","Time is of the essence – 2014 to 2023 was estimated to be the warmest 10-year period on record at around 1.2°C above the average between 1850 and 19001. Last year was the hottest recorded and the first where surface temperatures exceeded 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels2, but last year was also a different age.

If 2024 was the year of democracy as billions of people around the world cast their ballot, then 2025 – and beyond – is where we see seismic shifts in policies from new administrations, as well as the implications that cascade onto the domestic as well as the global stage.

According to the IEA, “the net zero emissions scenario envisages an increase in the capacity of CCS (carbon capture and storage) to 170 million tons in 20308.” Despite this, there is still a long way to go – CCUS continually makes up less than 0.5% of global investment in clean energy and efficient technologies, the IEA notes9.

The first industrial-scale CCUS projects are being launched across the cement industry. In 2024, Heidelberg Materials constructed the world’s first industrial-scale CCS facility – the Brevik cement plant in Norway, which is capable of capturing 400 kilotons of CO2 emissions per year.

“Heidelberg’s Brevik plant will deliver the world’s first carbon-captured net zero cement and concrete, with management expecting to be able to sell this product in the first half of this year,” says Eisenegger.

“We participated in the latest green bond deal to support the company’s build out of carbon capture technologies which directly mitigate climate change. While we expect some cyclical headwinds and negative price/cost spread to reduce future earnings, we expect the balance sheet to remain strong (net leverage 1.2x),” he adds. “Credit risk is currently very similar within the sector, while Heidelberg bonds have traded marginally wider. Therefore, we continue to see Heidelberg bonds compensating us relatively well for the underlying risk.”

Driving down transport emissions

Road transport is at the beginning of its most significant technological transformation in a century, with electrification, autonomous driving, clean hydrogen, and bioenergy at the forefront of the decarbonisation challenge.

In contrast to power generation, the transportation sector largely occupies the ‘high-cost’ area of the decarbonisation cost curve, responsible for approximately 20% global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, according to a Goldman Sachs report10.

Aviation: A new runway

Aviation’s share in anthropogenic global warming weighs in at approximately 4% to date11. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) envisions SAF contributing up to 65% of industry decarbonisation by 205012.

The importance of this technology is being recognised – and global authorities have it firmly in their regulatory sights as a vital enabler in decarbonising the aviation industry. As of 1 January 2025, the European Union’s (EU) SAF initiative (ReFuelEU Aviation) requires 2% of all fuel uplifted at EU airports to be SAF. This will increase to 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035 and 70% by 205013.

According to energy pioneer Neste, the company’s production capability of approximately 1.5 million tons of SAF per annum could meet the entire mandate between now and 2029 – but “all available SAF volumes will be needed for the industry to reduce its emissions to reach the industry's net-zero target14.”

Meanwhile, the UK’s SAF Mandate also took effect in 2025 at 2% of total UK jet fuel demand, rising in line to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040, with the government underlining its vital role in decarbonising the aviation industry. “The SAF Mandate could deliver up to 6.3 megatons of carbon savings per year by 204015,” the UK government’s website states.

While the market is growing, challenges remain. A paper published last year analysing SAFs reported that “the feasibility of SAF production still depends on feedstock availability, cost-effectiveness, and route selection. Overall, technological advancements and gradual cost reductions, coupled with policy drivers, will be key factors in promoting the widespread application and commercialisation of SAF16.” While SAF plays a crucial role as a key enabling technology, it is likely that SAF on its own can only achieve limited fuel substitution and other alternatives are needed to decarbonise aviation to a larger extent, eg electrification of short haul flights.

“In the case of Neste, fixed income investors can use green bonds as a financing instrument to support the capacity expansion of SAF, while staying clear from their oil and gas activity,” says Eisenegger. “This is thanks to the predefined project eligibility criteria which states how the proceeds of green bonds can be deployed by the issuer.

“The Rotterdam refinery expansion is expected to expand renewable product capacity by 1.3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2026 while the Singapore refinery expansion will have an optionality to produce up to 1mtpa of SAF,” he adds. “As bond valuations started to price in risks of a credit rating downgrade due to cyclical margins pressure, we have taken the opportunity to build a position in Neste via green bonds to benefit from an increasingly attractive financial risk-reward.”

Despite the promise of SAF, there is clearly still a long runway ahead to fall in line with the net zero emissions scenario, according to the IEA, which notes that “the use of SAF would need to increase more than twice as fast as in the NZE17 scenario, reaching about 4 exajoules (EJ) by 2030 and accounting for about 25% of the aviation fuel market18.”

Decarbonising buildings

Direct carbon emissions from buildings, both residential and commercial, account for a significant portion of total global CO2 emissions, primarily due to the use of fossil fuels for space and water heating.

Buildings operations account for “30% of global final energy consumption and 26% of global energy-related emissions (8% being direct emissions in buildings and 18% indirect emissions from the production of electricity and heat used in buildings)19”, according to the IEA.

Over the next three decades, the global building floor area is expected to skyrocket by 75% with emerging markets accounting for approximately 80% of the demand, the IEA stated. A transformative energy shift away from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives is therefore essential for buildings, whose operations contribute heavily to global emissions.

Transferring energy

Heat pumps (HPs) are critical for achieving net zero targets. Unlike conventional heating systems that generate heat by burning fossil fuels or through electric resistance, a heat pump “extracts heat from a source, such as the surrounding air, geothermal energy stored in the ground, or nearby sources of water or waste heat from a factory. It then amplifies and transfers the heat to where it is needed. Because most of the heat is transferred rather than generated, heat pumps are far more efficient than conventional heating technologies such as boilers or electric heaters and can be cheaper to run20,” the IEA notes.

Additionally, this source is produced at a much higher rate of efficiency – to the tune of 300% to 400%21. This means that HPs – which run on electricity from the grid – produce three to four times as much energy in the form of heat in comparison to what they’re consuming in electricity.

So far, policy plans by governments around the world indicate an increased use in heat pumps, which will have a clear impact on the use of oil, gas and coal for heating. According to the IEA, HPs can potentially remove at least 500 million tons of global carbon dioxide emissions in 203022.

“Johnson Controls International (JCI) offers one of the largest portfolios of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment and controls in the world, and we believe that the company has favourable structural end-market exposure and reliable financial policies that include both a firm investment grade commitment and a disciplined capital allocation policy amongst other attributes,” says Eisenegger.

“We own green bonds of JCI. The financing provided via these green bonds has helped avoid 1,200,000 metric tons of CO2e23 through eco-efficient and/or circular economy adapted projects, production technologies and processes such as the installation of heat pumps.”

Retro challenges

Invented in the 1850s and used in homes from the mid-20th century onwards, heat pumps are not a new invention, and their wider adoption still rests on overcoming hurdles. These range from high installation costs to potentially huge retrofits to larger buildings requiring better insulation and heating distribution.

Despite the benefits that HPs offer to help limit the rise in global temperatures, they also face a significant challenge in terms of electricity supply with concerns that they could face a surge in demand for electricity, particularly in colder climates.

“In the long-term, the decarbonisation of heat through electrification needs to be coupled with the successful decarbonisation of the electricity grid, which makes it more challenging,” a study by researchers in the Energy and Power Group at the University of Oxford’s Department of Engineering Science notes24. “Depending on the heating technologies deployed and the degree of consumer behavioural change, a significant increase in peak power demand might be observed.”

According to Claire Halloran, co-author of the report25, “if just 10% of British households switched to heat pumps it could increase peak electricity demand by 4% to 5%. This increase is nearly twice the power capacity of Hornsea 2, the largest offshore wind farm in Britain.”

Electrifying success

As with heat pumps, many enabling technologies are reliant on modernising and expanding the grid system, and when it comes to the success of net zero technologies, most roads lead back to electrification.

The widespread adoption of electrification is widely recognised as a crucial element in the energy transition. This is primarily due to the significant energy efficiency gains that can be achieved through electrification of economic activities. When generating electricity directly from renewable sources, efficiency can be two to three times higher compared to using fossil fuels. This is because the thermal conversion process of fossil fuels wastes the majority of the energy contained in hydrocarbons.

“Electrification is an inevitability,” says Eisenegger. “Electrification through reliable and carbon-neutral power infrastructure, with a smart power grid system serving as the backbone for its widespread adoption, is perhaps the crucially enabling role to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.”",https://mandg.scene7.com/is/image/mandg/amp4-thumbnail-cleanmachine,N,,2025-03-28 01:56:37.807056

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president of sustainability and chief economist, said: “CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry.
SAF supply is scarce, only available in a few places worldwide, so the goal of the SAF registry is to help solve the shortage problem by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers regardless of geographic location.
SAF Registry participation will be free until April 2027, after which the price will be determined on a cost-recovery basis.
Willie Walsh, director general of IATA, also commented: “The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has established the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO) to manage the IATA-developed Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry when its released.

CADO is a not-for-profit organisation based out of Montreal. As its founding member, IATA’s role in CADO will include ongoing technical support and operations.

To be eligible for CADO membership, organisations must meet one of the following three requirements.

They must be, either: organisations that operate in or contribute directly to the SAF value chain or represent associations or groups of participants within the chain; states or quasi-state organisations with a direct interest in the SAF Registry’s operations and benefits; or related interest groups indirectly benefiting from SAF deployed in the aviation system.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president of sustainability and chief economist, said: “CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders.

“In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonisation of the principles on which all SAF registries operate.”

IATA is developing the SAF Registry as a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardised and transparent way.

It will ensure the environmental benefits of SAF can be tracked throughout the SAF value chain and allow airlines and other corporations to use the benefit claims to meet regulatory obligations and voluntary commitments.

SAF supply is scarce, only available in a few places worldwide, so the goal of the SAF registry is to help solve the shortage problem by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers regardless of geographic location.

It will also provide airlines’ corporate customers with access to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalise on financial clients’ capacities to co-finance the cost of decarbonisation.

SAF Registry participation will be free until April 2027, after which the price will be determined on a cost-recovery basis.

Willie Walsh, director general of IATA, also commented: “The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF.

“The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigor.”

Walsh added: “Ramping-up SAF production is the common goal and the structure we are putting in place with CADO is an important step in moving decarbonisation forward.”",https://www.aviationbusinessnews.com/resources/uploads/2025/03/ABN-Images-2025-03-27T092332.704.webp,N,,2025-03-27 16:57:17.052793

During a visit(opens in a new tab) to Penn England Farms in Blair County, the Governor highlighted how a methane digester is converting farm waste into clean energy, cutting electricity costs, and reducing pollution. Under the Lightning Plan, more farmers will have access to shared digesters, further reducing costs and generating new revenue by selling excess energy back to the grid.

Backed by labor and industry leaders, environmental advocates, and consumer groups, the Lightning Plan fast-tracks energy projects, streamlines permitting, and delivers real savings for Pennsylvanians. Pennsylvania has long been at the forefront of energy innovation – from Ben Franklin’s experiments to today’s cutting-edge clean technologies– and the Lightning Plan builds on this legacy, ensuring the Commonwealth remains a national leader in energy production and economic growth for decades to come.

Earlier this month, Governor Shapiro launched(opens in a new tab) his legislative push for the Lightning Plan at Voith Hydro in York, one of the world’s largest dedicated hydropower manufacturing facilities. In January, the Governor unveiled(opens in a new tab) his plan during a visit to Pittsburgh International Airport, highlighting a $1.5 billion hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel project which is creating 3,000 construction jobs and positioning Pennsylvania as a hub for next-generation energy solutions. Additionally, he announced(opens in a new tab) a new agreement with PJM Interconnection, securing $21 billion in consumer savings over the next two years to lower household energy costs and protect Pennsylvania ratepayers.

Read what bipartisan legislators from the General Assembly; labor, industry, environmental, and consumer leaders; and Pennsylvanians from all across the Commonwealth are saying about Governor Shapiro’s Lightning Plan:

Yvette Longenecker, Owner of Penn England Farms: “Our family has spent generations producing high-quality milk while being responsible stewards of the land — that’s why we installed a digester. A digester allows us to turn something we already have — manure — into something valuable: renewable energy. It helps power our farm, reduces odors, improves water quality, and provides an additional revenue stream to keep our operation sustainable.”

Mark Heeter, President of the Blair County Farm Bureau: ""As a farmer and president of the Blair County Farm Bureau, I know the challenges our industry faces — from rising costs to the need for more efficient practices. That’s why today’s announcement is so important. The community energy proposal gives farmers the opportunity to invest in methane digesters, reduce energy costs, and improve farm operations to stay competitive. The Agricultural Innovation Program has already been a valuable resource, and increasing investment in this initiative is critical to ensuring farmers can access the technology needed to keep their businesses strong. On behalf of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau and farmers across the state, I thank the administration for recognizing the importance of agriculture and supporting innovation. We look forward to working together to strengthen our industry.""

Steven McKnight, President and CEO of the Altoona Blair County Development Corporation (ABCD): “It’s an honor to share the podium with Governor Shapiro and Secretary Redding. I had the privilege of serving as President of the Pennsylvania Economic Development Association when the Governor took office, and we were eager to engage with the new administration’s vision. Governor Shapiro quickly recognized that Pennsylvania’s last formal economic development plan was from 2003 — outdated for today’s modern economy. Since then, his administration has worked hard to create bold initiatives like the Site Development Fund, housing programs, Main Street revitalization, and the Lightning Plan, which we’re here to highlight today. Programs like these are fueling growth across the Commonwealth, allowing rural and agricultural communities — like Williamsburg — to embrace innovative energy solutions, reduce costs, and stay competitive. Governor Shapiro, we appreciate your vision, planning, and ongoing partnership in strengthening Pennsylvania’s economy.""

Senator Judy Schwank: “Community Energy will make clean, renewable energy more affordable and accessible for farmers, helping them lower utility costs and boost profitability. I'm proud to partner with Governor Shapiro to introduce Community Energy legislation, which is just one exciting piece of the Lightning Plan. This is a pivotal opportunity to come together and embrace comprehensive energy policies that will power Pennsylvania's bright future.""

Representative Peter Schweyer: “The demand for energy in Pennsylvania continues to grow and as demand rises so does the strain on the utility grid. Community energy will help reduce the strain on the electricity grid and help lower utility costs by allowing people that cannot currently utilize solar panels or other renewable energy sources to get access. Folks can save money and reap the grid benefits. I am pleased to work with Gov. Shapiro on community energy and look forward to getting this bill across the finish line and to his desk.”

Stanley Kocon, President & CEO of Voith Hydro North America: “Demand for electricity in the US is growing, and hydro power stands out as one of the most reliable and sustainable renewable energy sources available, not only for generating electricity, but also for storing energy – an often overlooked but essential resource to maintain a stable energy grid. We wholeheartedly support the Governor’s plan to lower electricity costs and to build and upgrade more power plants to ensure clean, reliable and affordable energy for Pennsylvania's future.”

Jim Enders, President of the Central Pennsylvania Building & Construction Trades Council: “We’re long overdue to unite behind a strategy that encourages energy production, lowers costs for energy consumers, creates good paying union jobs that offer family sustaining wages, and at the same time is mindful of the planet that we will leave behind for our kids and our grandkids. These are common sense goals that we should all be able to agree on. Organized labor is encouraged by the Governor’s leadership on an energy plan that creates thousands of good paying union jobs and puts Pennsylvania energy at the forefront.”

Kevin Schreiber, President & CEO, York County Economic Alliance: “The Lightning Plan’s impact on communities like York – where manufacturing is not just an industry but a way of life – will be transformative. The plan will attract new investments and stimulate job creation by prioritizing sustainable energy production and modernizing tax and other incentives, ensuring that advanced manufacturing remains a cornerstone of local economies. It will also empower manufacturers, such as Voith Hydro, to continue to expand operations and lead global energy innovation.”

Patrick McDonnell, President & CEO of PennFuture: “It's not just enough for us as a Commonwealth to reduce our reliance on fossil fuel infrastructure. It's important for us to boost the amount of renewable energy here in the state. It's important for us to realize the benefits to air quality, to water quality, to build those things. The lightning plan is a real, concrete way for us to reduce energy costs for consumers and to make sure we're putting the people of Pennsylvania to work.”

Senator Carolyn Comitta: “As a major energy-producing state, Pennsylvania is in a unique position to lead on sustainable energy sources that can reduce electric costs for families, bring new jobs to our communities, and help secure our right to clean air and pure water. PACER and the Governor’s “Lightning Plan” are the way forward to cleaner air, better economic opportunities, and consumer savings on electricity bills,” said Comitta, who serves as Minority Chair of the Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee. “I thank Governor Shapiro, Rep. Abney, and our legislative partners and co-sponsors for coming together to prioritize Pennsylvania’s future.”

Representative Aerion Abney: “PACER is a win-win for the environment and Pennsylvanians. The program is a tremendous boost to economies across the state by creating many new jobs in the energy sector and reinvests crucial funds in the protection of our planet’s health for generations to come.”

Representative Steve Samuelson: “The current qualifications for a business to claim the Semiconductor tax credits are unattainable. Not only do they leave out worthy businesses making great strides in manufacturing a key component of our electronic devices, but the credits have gone unused for the past two years. My bill would make the credits more attainable, ultimately achieving the goal of spurring economic development.”

Senator Steve Santarsiero: “I have long said that it’s a false premise to say we must choose between creating jobs OR saving our planet. I applaud Governor Shapiro for leading the way and bringing together the interests of consumers, labor and the environment to find a solution that works for all of us. To that end, I am proud to introduce legislation to create the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard, the next generation of alternative energy portfolio standards for the Commonwealth. PRESS will turbocharge energy build-out in Pennsylvania and create a more diverse mix of energy resources focusing on clean, reliable, and affordable energy.”

Representative Danielle Otten: “Pennsylvania is at a critical juncture. With energy demand skyrocketing, the PJM capacity markets facing unprecedented price spikes, and our state sorely lagging in clean energy investments, it’s imperative that we act now. PRESS, as part of Governor Shapiro's Lightning Plan, will help to diversify our energy sources, reduce emissions, build resiliency into our grid, improve reliability, and lower electricity costs for ratepayers, while creating workforce opportunities and securing Pennsylvania's position as a leader in clean, reliable, and affordable energy for the next 20 years.""

Senator John I. Kane: ""Pennsylvania has always been a leader in energy innovation, but red tape has held us back from building the next generation of reliable energy projects. I'm thrilled to see Governor Shapiro taking bold action with the Lightning Plan, and I'm proud to be the prime sponsor of the RESET Board, which will be a key part of that vision. This one-stop shop for energy development will get steel in the ground faster, create good jobs, lower costs for consumers, and ensure Pennsylvania remains an energy powerhouse for decades to come.""

Representative Mandy Steele: “If we are serious, really and truly serious, about supercharging energy development in the state to bring costs down for Pennsylvanians and set us up as a dominant energy leader, we must streamline the process. Creating a Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition Board will speed up the entire process, from permitting to reducing red tape, and supporting new energy projects in a big way. I am happy to be able to work with the governor on getting this proposal through the legislative process and become law.”

Senator Lisa Boscola: ""Pennsylvania’s energy future requires a balanced approach, one that prioritizes both supply and demand. Act 129 is a needed but outdated initiative. When first introduced, the program helped make households more efficient by changing out inefficient appliances. As demand continues to outpace supply, we need to reimagine the tools used to create efficiencies in our homes and businesses. Reforming this program will give homeowners and businesses the incentives they need to reduce their energy bills by making investments in items that will drive down their energy consumption. By driving down demand, the program helps ensure we have the power we need to keep Pennsylvania running. Act 129 reforms are just one component of a strategic energy policy that includes smart investments in energy efficiency, resiliency, and generation.""

Representative Kyle Donahue: “I believe that Gov. Shapiro’s lighting plan is a fruitful step forward for the energy industry in Pennsylvania. This plan will create jobs, lower costs for consumers, protect Pennsylvania from global instability by building next generation power, and position the commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come. I look forward to working with Gov. Shapiro and my colleagues in the state House and Senate to support legislation that will enact this plan.”

Senator Jay Costa: “As a lifelong resident of Allegheny County, I know how important it is to deliver good, honest union jobs to our working families, regardless of whether they have a college degree. I also know the importance of keeping costs down wherever possible, so folks can put their hard-earned money where they want it to go, like their kids’ college funds or family vacation. I am proud to be supporting Governor Shapiro on his plans to do both things at once through his Lightning Energy Plan. By unleashing Pennsylvania’s energy potential, Governor Shapiro will create energy jobs, lower energy costs, protect PA’s energy independence, and position our commonwealth as a leader in the nation.”

Senator Nick Pisciottano: “I commend Governor Shapiro for this bold, responsible, forward-looking energy plan, and I am happy to be a prime sponsor in the Senate of the EDGE tax credit programs, designed to attract new investments from businesses in critical manufacturing sectors. I share the Governor’s commitment to affordable, clean, and reliable energy for every family, business, and community in Pennsylvania. This plan will lower electricity costs, which is a top priority for our residents who are facing rising utility bills. We are excited to introduce a plan that strikes a vital balance between meeting the growing energy demands of our state, while also making sure we are protecting our environment for future generations. By focusing on both innovation and practical solutions, we are setting the stage for Pennsylvania to thrive in the energy sector and compete in the global economy.”

Representative John Inglis: “Pennsylvania energy powered the industrial revolution and Pennsylvania energy will power the technological revolutions of the future – if we make the right investments to support the projects that create jobs today and help create jobs for years to come. I’m proud to be the sponsor of the EDGE tax credits in the Lightning package to help fund energy generation and infrastructure upgrades and a brighter future.”

Representative Rob Matzie: “Pennsylvania is the crossroads of America for roads, rails, and skies. Investing in sustainable aviation fuel production with the Lightning plan helps cut emissions, create good-paying jobs, and support innovation in agriculture.”

Representative Tom Mehaffie: “Pennsylvania has lost out because the PA EDGE tax credit program was not utilized as envisioned. We are overdue to re-energize the tax credits and ensure the Commonwealth – and nation – have sources of PA-produced, reliable power for years to come.”

For additional information about these proposed rules, please see PwC Insight IRS notices provide initial guidance on the Section 45Z clean fuel credit.
Detailed records must substantiate the production and emissions rates for the credit, and certification is required for sustainable aviation fuel.","In brief

What happened?

Starting in 2025, the Section 45Z clean fuel production credit replaces the Sections 40A and 40B tax credits. Earlier this year, Treasury and the IRS released guidance on the Section 45Z credit, which applies to clean transportation fuel (1) produced at a qualified facility in the United States and (2) sold between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2027, with specific criteria for emissions rates and facility qualifications.

Why is it relevant?

Enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Section 45Z provides a tax credit of 20 cents per gallon of clean transportation fuel produced at a qualified facility by a taxpayer and sold to an unrelated person after 2024. The credit amount is 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel. These amounts are multiplied by five if the taxpayer meets prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or exceptions in constructing, repairing, or altering the facility. Notice 2025-10 provides rules that Treasury and the IRS intend to propose in forthcoming proposed regulations on Section 45Z, while Notice 2025-11 offers general information on determining fuel emissions rates and includes the initial emissions rate table.

Action to consider

To claim the Section 45Z credit, a taxpayer must (1) register under Section 4101 as a producer of clean fuel and (2) provide certification from an unrelated party of compliance with certain requirements for sustainable aviation fuel. Taxpayers that may be affected by the forthcoming proposed regulations should consider submitting comments by the April 10 due date.

In detail

Section 45Z provides a tax credit for clean transportation fuel produced at a qualified facility in the United States and sold to an unrelated person for various uses. To qualify, the fuel must meet specific lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions criteria published by Treasury in an annual table of emissions rates for different fuel types. Nonaviation fuels are subject to the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model, while sustainable aviation fuels are subject to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or similar methodologies. The Section 45Z credit amount is determined by the fuel's emissions factor and applicable rates, and companies that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are eligible to increase the credit amount by a multiple of five.

Observation: Section 45Z’s reliance on GREET and CORSIA to determine whether fuels meet emissions and production standards is consistent with other technology-neutral credits enacted as part of the IRA.

Notice 2025-10 details proposed rules under Section 45Z for qualified facilities, ownership, and production. The notice provides that (1) a qualified facility includes all components that function interdependently to produce transportation fuel and (2) carbon capture equipment can be used to contribute to the lifecycle GHG emissions rate. Significantly, a company is not required to own the facility to claim a Section 45Z credit, as production is attributed to the producer. Notice 2025-10 clarifies that a company must engage in substantial processing activities, which excludes minimal processing activities like blending, to qualify as a producer. Additionally, the fuels must be suitable for use in highway vehicles or aircraft. The notice also provides methodologies for determining emissions rates for different fuel types.

Observation: Notice 2025-10 provides rules that may be included in forthcoming proposed regulations on Section 45Z. It provides preliminary guidance that is not binding on taxpayers. For additional information about these proposed rules, please see PwC Insight IRS notices provide initial guidance on the Section 45Z clean fuel credit.

Taxpayers may obtain a provisional emissions rate for novel fuels or those using un-established pathways under Notice 2025-10 by first obtaining an emissions value from the Department of Energy. Detailed records must substantiate the production and emissions rates for the credit, and certification is required for sustainable aviation fuel. Registration under Section 4101 is necessary to qualify for the credit, with specific requirements for re-registration and notification of ownership changes.

Notice 2025-11 provides background on the CORSIA program and the 45ZCF-GREET model for determining emissions rates. Taxpayers are required to use the most recent determinations from the emissions rate table for nonaviation fuels and choose between CORSIA or 45ZCF-GREET for sustainable aviation fuels.

Observation: The GREET life cycle analysis was developed by the Department of Energy to assess the environmental impacts associated with technologies, fuels, products, and energy systems across various stages of the supply chain. Other IRA credits that rely on the GREET model include Section 40B for sustainable aviation fuel and Section 45V for clean hydrogen. See our PwC Insights for more information:

Under ambitious plans to tackle climate change, the EU will require airlines to gradually increase the amount of so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) they use to power planes.

But airlines complain SAF is not widely available and too expensive, hampering competitiveness.

""We don't have enough SAF, and the SAF that we have is very expensive,"" Luis Gallego, CEO of the IAG airline group bringing together Iberia, British Airways and other carriers, told a press conference.

Gallego was speaking on behalf of Airlines for Europe (A4E), an industry group representing 17 airlines including Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, at an event it held in Brussels.

EU rules require carriers to include two per cent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six per cent in 2030 and then soaring to 70 per cent from 2050.

But a study published by A4E estimates SAF production would be 30 per cent below levels necessary to achieve the goal in 2030, according to Gallego.

""It is now clear that SAF supply will not be sufficient to meet the six per cent target by 2030,"" said Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary.

""Unless action is taken now, the only realistic solution is to move the 2030"" target, added Gallego.

Contributing to almost three per cent of carbon dioxide emissions globally, the aviation sector is among the toughest to decarbonise.

“Previously, used cooking oil was usually just disposed of, causing pollution to waterways and rivers. However, these days, used cooking oil is being used as the base material for the production of SAF.

“In years to come, sustainable aviation fuel is expected to become a mandatory requirement internationally. As such, the collection and recycling of used cooking oil not only helps prevent environmental pollution but also contributes to reducing carbon emissions in the aviation sector, which is one of the sectors with the highest carbon emission rates,” he said.

He said this when met at the programme to collect used cooking oil at the Taman Setapak Jaya Ramadan Bazaar organised by FatHopes Energy Sdn Bhd, in collaboration with Eko Setiawangsa here yesterday. It was also attended by FatHopes Energy chief executive officer Vinesh Sinha.

Meanwhile, Vinesh Sinha said the aviation sector is the most difficult to decarbonise due to the lack of viable alternatives.

“Whereas in road transport, multiple options such as electrification and hydrogen are available. As a Malaysian company, we believe it is our responsibility to help solve the world’s biggest challenges,“ he said.

He added that the Malaysian government has provided strong support for this initiative and hopes that new policies will be introduced to regulate the country’s entire ecosystem.

He also shared that FatHopes Energy has been collecting used cooking oil at Ramadan bazaars nationwide daily.

“During Ramadan, we can collect around 2,000 to 3,000 kilogrammes of used cooking oil per day from each bazaar. This initiative is being carried out nationwide, with the most visible presence in Kuala Lumpur. However, we are also actively operating nationwide, including in Sabah and Sarawak.

Airline company Delta is partnering with aviation startup JetZero to develop a sleek and sustainable aircraft that ""looks and feels like nothing flying today's commercial skies,"" per Delta News Hub.

Delta's Sustainable Skies Lab, which launched in 2023, will help bring JetZero's blended-wing-body aircraft to life. The plane is ""expected to be up to 50% more fuel-efficient than aircraft in operation today, with flight range and seat capacity comparable to today's mid-range international aircraft — all with existing engine technology,"" Delta News Hub reported.

The goal is not only to help Delta reach their net-zero emissions goal by 2050, but to develop and implement new technology that could change the aviation industry completely. JetZero insists their design will fly within this decade. Early last year, their scaled-down Pathfinder model received an airworthiness certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration, allowing JetZero to do official test flights.

Energy-efficient, sustainable aircraft development like JetZero's could pave the way for net-zero aviation pollution. Globally, the aviation industry is responsible for 2.5% of carbon dioxide emissions, and has ""grown faster between 2000 and 2019 than rail, road or shipping,"" per the International Energy Agency.

Delta has already made good progress on their path to sustainability. A sustainable aviation fuel blending facility is under construction in Minnesota, and will help Delta replace planet-polluting jet fuel.

Tom O'Leary, the cofounder and CEO of JetZero, told Delta News Hub that ""JetZero is working to change the world by bringing to market an aircraft that aims to fly this decade and make immediate and marked progress toward reducing airline energy costs, and the associated emissions.""

""The ability to realize such significant efficiency gains in the near future meaningfully impacts the industry's commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and will serve as the foundation on which other technologies and efficiencies can be realized,"" O'Leary said.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/JetZeroimage-recwb7TqdjW5h8sOC.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 13:56:48.464600

“At the end of the day, you see that the growth is there for air travel,” she said.
The net result: Research published in Nature shows that aviation emissions have more than doubled since 1990.
The European Union also reported that aviation emissions in Europe have doubled since 1990.
“So far, the sector has made almost no progress on the latter,” Ritchie wrote in a report on aviation emissions.","At the Airbus Summit in France on Tuesday, Chief Sustainability Officer Julie Kitcher claimed that aviation emissions have remained “relatively stable” and that innovation could help offset the industry’s continued growth.

While steady as a share of total emissions, the record shows a rise in aviation emissions in the past three decades and there are several challenges to implementing new tools that make air travel more efficient.

Kitcher made her case on a panel discussing limiting the amount of flights to slow down emissions: “We’ve seen that over the decades, although air travel has doubled, actually the greenhouse gas emissions from aviation have remained relatively stable. So it shows that the technology and the measures that we’re implementing are offsetting the growth from aviation,” Kitcher said at the conference.

Kitcher added that rather than limiting air travel, the focus should be on decarbonization strategies such as alternative fuels and more efficient aircraft.

“At the end of the day, you see that the growth is there for air travel,” she said. “So it’s really about being able to offset and reduce emissions with the right tools to be able to get us to net zero in 2050.”

When asked about Kitcher's remarks, an Airbus spokesperson pointed Skift to a 2024 Airbus report that showed that aviation's share of global carbon dioxide emissions had remained at around 2%.

Aviation Emissions: What the Research Shows

Over the years, aircraft have become more fuel-efficient, helping to slow the growth of emissions in the aviation sector, which contributes around 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions annually.

Between 1990 and 2019, air travel for both passenger and freight quadrupled, according to Hannah Ritchie, Deputy Editor of Our World in Data at the University of Oxford’s Oxford Martin School.

At the same time, aircraft became twice as energy efficient.

The net result: Research published in Nature shows that aviation emissions have more than doubled since 1990.

A study in Science Direct, which analyzed aviation emissions data from sources including historical flight records, the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization, reached similar conclusions.

The European Union also reported that aviation emissions in Europe have doubled since 1990.

The industry itself has admitted that progress has been slow.

The sector hadn’t “made as much progress” as it wanted, “or is needed, on decarbonizing the aviation sector,” said International Air Transport Association (IATA) director Willie Walsh in December.

Greener Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) Falling Behind

Future emissions will depend on whether aviation can maintain the efficiency gains and transition to low-carbon fuels, Ritchie said.

“So far, the sector has made almost no progress on the latter,” Ritchie wrote in a report on aviation emissions.

Many airlines have committed to using SAF to help reduce emissions. But concerns remain over its limited supply.

Kitcher acknowledged this during her presentation. “We need to find a way to stimulate the capital,” she said. “It will all come down to the business case. We've got to get an attractive business case for our airline customers, for suppliers, for banks to be able to really make a difference.”

Meanwhile, air travel demand continues to rise. IATA reported record high global demand in 2024. And Airbus projects that air traffic will more than double in the next 20 years.

Much of the growth is expected to come from regions like India and China.

Some experts worry that slower adoption of climate policies in these regions could delay decarbonization efforts. Kitcher said she remains optimistic about progress in these markets.

“We shouldn’t underestimate what is happening in China and India when it comes to renewable fuel,” she said. “Connectivity, economic growth, reducing emissions - there’s a lot happening.”

During the summit, the company provided an update on its plans for a hydrogen powered aircraft that could enter service in the second half of the 2030’s.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are required by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, starting with a 2 percent quota in 2025 and aiming for 70 percent SAF in all EU airports by 2050.

Led by France-headed Elyse Energy, a pioneering industrial SME specializing in the production of sustainable fuels and low-carbon raw materials, the BioTJet project is based on the E-BioTfueL concept, which combines biomass eligible to produce advanced biofuels per EU RED definition and green or low-carbon hydrogen eligible to produce renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RFNBO) or electro-fuels (eFuels).

The technology brings proven process building blocks that have been developed and tested in a semi-industrial plant from 2010 to 2021 by the Bionext consortium, comprising Avril, Axens, CEA, IFP Energies Nouvelles, TotalEnergies, and thyssenkrupp Uhde.

After thoroughly examining the available and bankable technologies, we are now more convinced than ever that we have made the right choice for our project with the E-BioTfueL concept and the technology partners involved to provide cost-competitive SAF and naphtha to the market by 2030 and contribute to address climate change, said Pascal Penicaud, President of Elyse Energy.

Detailed engineering phase

Axens signed a license agreement for BioTfueL technology in 2024, which includes a “PRENFLO” gasification technology from thyssenkrupp Uhde, a “GASEL” Fischer-Tropsch and syngas upgrading technology from Axens with a basic engineering completed in November 2024 and currently being within the detail engineering phase.

Brussels: Major European airlines on Thursday urged the European Union to reconsider green targets for the sector unless production of renewable fuels picks up and costs can be brought down.

Under ambitious plans to tackle climate change, the EU will require airlines to gradually increase the amount of so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) they use to power planes.

But airlines complain SAF is not widely available and too expensive, hampering competitiveness.

""We don't have enough SAF, and the SAF that we have is very expensive,"" Luis Gallego, CEO of the IAG airline group bringing together Iberia, British Airways and other carriers, told a press conference.

Advt

Gallego was speaking on behalf of Airlines for Europe (A4E), an industry group representing 17 airlines including Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, at an event it held in Brussels.

EU rules require carriers to include two percent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six percent in 2030 and then soaring to 70 percent from 2050.

But a study published by A4E estimates SAF production would be 30 percent below levels necessary to achieve the goal in 2030, according to Gallego.

""It is now clear that SAF supply will not be sufficient to meet the six percent target by 2030,"" said Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary.

""Unless action is taken now, the only realistic solution is to move the 2030"" target, added Gallego.

Contributing to almost three percent of carbon dioxide emissions globally, the aviation sector is among the toughest to decarbonise.

SAF -- a biofuel that produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel, made from plant and animal materials like cooking oil and fat -- is seen as a crucial ingredient to hitting emissions targets.

It is expected to provide 65 percent of aviation's ""net zero"" mitigation by 2050.

SAF costs three to five times more than traditional jet fuel and makes up only 0.3% of global jet fuel supply. European airlines are this year expected to use 2% of SAF in their jet fuel mix, with the mandate rising to 6% in 2030.

A Boston Consulting Group report published today found that airlines and airports are investing only 1% to 3% of revenue or budget allocation to SAF.

US President Donald Trump's call for more fossil fuel investment is adding to pressure on the fledgling green fuel market.

Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said the oil majors - the biggest likely producers - were already cutting back their SAF programmes.

The airlines said the European Union's sustainability rules created an unfair cost burden on them, giving an advantage to international carriers that do not have to meet sustainability mandates and can fly longer routes.

""Our market shares are going down not only to government-owned carriers in the East but also private competitors and some partners in the US. European aviation is falling behind,"" Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said.

As with the car sector, aviation could benefit from an easing of sustainability requirements, executives said.

""We all know we started with a Green Deal that now has been moved into a clean deal. And I think we also need a lean deal"", said Spohr.

The European Commission proposed last month in its ""Simplification Omnibus"" to cut the burden of climate-related reporting but the focus was to relieve the pressure on small and medium companies.

Meanwhile, the CEO of IAG also said today that Heathrow was not meeting expectations, given the high costs of operating out of the British airport.

""Heathrow is the most expensive in the world but the quality that we have there is not according to what we pay,"" Luis Gallego said.

Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said airlines should have the right to recover expenses tied to the shut down last week.",https://img.rasset.ie/00152070-1600.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 11:56:59.491355

Stephen Forshaw, chief representative of Airbus in Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific, says that aviation has a pressing need to decarbonise, as only this will give it the “licence” to continue operating in the decades ahead, especially as consumers become more conscious about their carbon emissions.

He also observes that 80% of Australia’s jet fuel was imported in 2024, compared with just 50% a decade ago. This creates an energy security issue.

On how to resolve these issues, Forshaw says that Australia is extremely well placed to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) given the ready availability of feedstocks.

In addition to providing energy security, a robust Australian SAF capability will also provide jobs and, most important, reduce the emissions associated with flying.

Boeing used the show to make a presentation about Cascade 2.0, a publicly available climate impact model that lets users adjust a range of variables to help map out the industry’s decarbonisation journey.

Demonstrating Cascade to reporters at Boeing’s stand, the company’s vice-president of environmental sustainability Ryan Faucett manipulated factors such as air traffic growth, fuel type, aircraft type, and operational efficiencies to help assess their long-term impact on reducing emissions.

By way of demonstration, he laid out one hypothetical whereby sustainable aviation fuel, offsets, new aircraft types, and operations combined to vastly reduce emissions by 2050.

Faucett says the tool can help policy makers and other industry participants gauge the impact of the various factors involved in the industry’s reduction of emissions.

“It paints a picture of exactly what it would take on all sets of removals to get all the way to net zero,” says Faucett.

In addition, discussions advanced on ethanol-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which could benefit Brazilian agribusiness -particularly the country's sugar-energy industry- and the development of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, dubbed “flying cars,” which are expected to enter operation by 2027 through a joint venture between Embraer and Japanese companies.

The Brazilian delegation announced Wednesday the purchase by Japanese carrier All Nippon Aiways (ANA) of 20 E-190 aircraft. The company also intends to buy another five aircraft, it was explained.

Brazil's Minister of Ports and Airports Silvio Costa Filho said that the partnership with the Japanese will serve as a kind of seal for new sales to other countries, further expanding Embraer's business horizon.

“And with the sale of aircraft to international markets, we will need to prepare Brazilian labor, structuring our great plan to prepare our young people for this new job market that is emerging in Brazil, which is aviation,” he added. To this end, Brazil is already developing qualification and training programs for this job market, he further noted.

“This will generate jobs and income. It will stimulate the economy,” the minister also said, adding that all the Japanese companies he had spoken to had assured him that they would make Embraer a priority for their business.

Negotiations have also progressed with a view to the Japanese aviation sector adopting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), an alternative to fossil-based aviation fuel. According to the Brazilian government, this fuel can be obtained from various sources. Among them, ethanol produced from sugar cane.

“SAF is a fuel that consists of ethanol. It is, therefore, significant for the Brazilian agribusiness industry. In addition, we are working alongside all the ministers in Japan, including the Prime Minister, to ensure that 10% of the fuel here in Japan is made from ethanol,” the Brazilian official also mentioned.

This fuel can also be obtained from agricultural waste, used cooking oil, fats, and corn, among others, pure or mixed, according to technical safety specifications. According to the Planalto, Brazil has “extensive expertise on the subject.”

“As well as boosting aviation fuel here in Japan, we will stimulate Brazil's sugar-energy industry, which is in dialogue with sustainability, through this fuel of the future that Brazil has presented to the world,” added the minister.

Also part of the Brazilian delegation, Embraer President Francisco Gomes Neto said that the Japanese were also interested in developing the electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOL), a 100% electric vehicle known as a “flying car.”

“Our plan is for it to be in operation by the end of 2027. It's the vehicle of the future, a disruptive innovation, ideal for countries [and cities] with heavy traffic, such as Japan, São Paulo, Los Angeles or New York,” said Gomes Neto, explaining that the electric motors will be produced through a joint venture between Embraer and a Japanese company.

This initiative aims to boost both supply and demand for SAF worldwide, providing a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate SAF adoption.

The first MoU was signed by SMBC Aviation Capital, followed by AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment and SAF Aerogroup, who confirmed their interest in joining this collaborative initiative, reinforcing the industry-wide intention to increase SAF adoption.

In simple terms, the book and claim approach allows a buyer to “book” a certain amount of SAF and “claim” the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. Through a pilot programme running throughout 2025, Airbus will leverage this system to improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those with limited volumes and far from supply points.

As a facilitator, Airbus will purchase SAF certificates and manage the associated sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognised sustainability certification body. These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft and helicopter operators, thereby stimulating short-term demand for SAF.

The pilot programme is expected to generate key insights into the capacity and robustness of this innovative book and claim mechanism. It will also assess market interest in third-party facilitation of such integrated SAF solutions.

Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, says, “Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market. For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to SAF can be challenging depending on the amount of SAF needed. Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and derisk the process for operators and SAF suppliers, by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them. This is also a great opportunity to demonstrate Book and Claim is reliable and that its usage should be extended in voluntary and regulatory markets.”",https://memuknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/unnamed-4-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 11:57:23.642782

Background and significance

Japan is among the leading countries in terms of forest resources worldwide, with high expectations that thinning materials and residues generated from wood usage can be leveraged as sustainable raw materials due to their potential volume. In addition, the use of wood in large-scale wooden buildings, including high-rise buildings, is currently in the spotlight from the perspective of resource circulation, and it is expected that there will be an increase in opportunities to utilize the residues generated as a result of such initiatives.

Current status and initiatives of the aviation and chemical industries:

Overview of the pre-feasibility study

This study envisions the potential use of manufacturing technology developed by Licella*1 to produce a bio-intermediate (renewable oil) from wood residues, which will then be reformed and refined for use in making products such as SAF, bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel towards the building of a domestic supply chain. This supply will leverage a model involving local consumption of locally produced products.

Problems in Solutions CalPERS does indeed classify a small proportion of its investments in oil and gas companies as providing climate solutions, confirmed Peter Cashion, managing investment director for sustainable investments, speaking during the investor’s mid-March board meeting.
He also reiterated the importance CalPERS places on engaging with oil and gas companies to promote sustainability at these corporations.
Witness how CalPERS $5 billion allocation to a Climate Transition Index underweights oil and gas companies with no transition plan.
California Common Good also called for more details on the private equity, private debt, infrastructure and real estate holdings CalPERS classifies as climate solutions.","CalPERS has hit back at criticism from a coalition of environmental advocates and public sector unions, California Common Good, that its flagship $53 billion sustainable portfolio which it hopes to double to $100 billion by the end of the decade includes a $3.5 billion allocation to many of the world’s biggest polluters.

The organisation used public records, including filing a California Public Records Act request, to highlight that CalPERS’ climate adaptation, transition, and mitigation investments include holdings in 52 of the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters. The report aims most of its criticism at CalPERS’ inclusion of seven oil and gas companies in the portfolio.

“Unfortunately, the report raises unfounded concerns that CalPERS isn’t serious about addressing climate change. Even worse, it could be construed as suggesting that CalPERS is intentionally misleading its 2.2 million members and the public about the intent of our climate investing program,” said CEO Marcie Frost in a statement.

Problems in Solutions

CalPERS does indeed classify a small proportion of its investments in oil and gas companies as providing climate solutions, confirmed Peter Cashion, managing investment director for sustainable investments, speaking during the investor’s mid-March board meeting.

Specific business lines at these companies amount to $67 million worth of investments in activities that qualify as climate solutions like developing green biodiesel, carbon capture technology and sustainable aviation fuel.

CalPERS measures portfolio companies’ green business activity using a taxonomy that tracks climate solution investments across three categories – mitigation, adaptation and transition. Under the transition umbrella, Cashion said it is possible for high emitting companies in hard to abate sectors to qualify as providing a climate solution if they have transition strategies that support pro-climate activities.

Using this approach, CalPERS values 1 per cent of its $234 million Saudi Aramco holding as a climate solution, for example. Elsewhere the investor classes its $12.6 million investment in Indian coal giant Adani Group’s Green Energy subsidiary as a climate solution.

CalPERS uses a variety of globally recognised data providers to measure companies’ green activity including Financial Times Stock Exchange, HSBC and MSCI and Blomberg. The CalPERS team have sought out best practices supported by the Institutional Investor Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).

Cashion said the allocation reflects CalPERS belief that “a green asset is a green asset regardless of corporate ownership” whereby even if a green asset sits on the balance sheet of an oil producer, it is still viewed as green.

He also reiterated the importance CalPERS places on engaging with oil and gas companies to promote sustainability at these corporations. Witness how CalPERS $5 billion allocation to a Climate Transition Index underweights oil and gas companies with no transition plan.

Frost said that CalPERS’ approach to assessing climate solutions has been iterative in a reflection of the emergence of best practices and additional data. “We wish things were easier. CalPERS has long supported clarity and consistency in climate investing definitions. We reject any suggestion that our methodology wasn’t well researched or independently authenticated,” she stated.

She also reiterated why CalPERS does not support climate divestment, something she called a “a symbolic act that not only ignores the value of climate transformations and investor engagement, but a possible breach of our fiduciary duty as required under the California Constitution.”

Her response underscores the challenges investors face balancing financial returns with their climate commitments. CalPERS believes that its influence can push polluting companies toward greener practices and support funding clean energy technologies. Yet transition progress is slow – and remaining invested is an essential return stream for CalPERS 2 million beneficiaries.

California Common Good also called for more details on the private equity, private debt, infrastructure and real estate holdings CalPERS classifies as climate solutions. The lobby group said this was particularly important given CalPERS has announced plans to increase private holdings to 40 per cent of its portfolio.",https://media.top1000funds.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MF_B7164.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 05:56:07.452987

European airlines are expected to meet a mandate of 2% SAF use in their jet fuel this year, with that figure set to rise to 6% by 2030.
However, many airlines have lamented the high cost of the fuel, which is typically three to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, reported Reuters.
While the global aviation industry is aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and some countries have SAF mandates in place, the fuel accounted for only about 0.3% of global jet fuel production in 2024.
Aviation Industry Fueling Progress Although advances are being made in the science and industry of SAF production, progress is too slow to meet the aviation industry’s decarbonisation goals, according to a 2024 Mckinsey & Company report.","The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry is at risk of missing its 2030 target, as production is not accelerating quickly enough, according to a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found in a report published on March 27.

European airlines are expected to meet a mandate of 2% SAF use in their jet fuel this year, with that figure set to rise to 6% by 2030. However, many airlines have lamented the high cost of the fuel, which is typically three to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, reported Reuters.

The report found that airlines and airports are investing only 1% to 3% of their revenue or budget allocation to SAF, indicating that high production costs and fuel prices remain major challenges to adoption.

“We are going in the positive direction, but clearly not at the speed we need,” BCG Managing Director and Partner Pelayo Losada told Reuters, talking about his executives at about 200 aviation-related companies.

“Despite continuing to scale the availability of sustainable aviation fuel and we see that trend very clearly, there is slowdown in the development of projects and even bigger gaps to some of the commitments that some of the companies have made,” added Losada.

While the global aviation industry is aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and some countries have SAF mandates in place, the fuel accounted for only about 0.3% of global jet fuel production in 2024.

BCG’s report highlights that while SAF supply increased 1,150% worldwide over the last three years, announcements for new production facilities fell by 50% to 70% from 2022 to 2023.

Aviation Industry Fueling Progress

Although advances are being made in the science and industry of SAF production, progress is too slow to meet the aviation industry’s decarbonisation goals, according to a 2024 Mckinsey & Company report.

The report further highlighted that trillions in additional capital will be required to build the necessary infrastructure to meet global demand by 2050 as more players invest in the SAF supply chain.",https://media.assettype.com/outlookbusiness/2025-01-01/zluiktpp/IMAGE_1659348500.webp?w=1200&amp;ar=40%3A21&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;ogImage=true&amp;mode=crop&amp;enlarge=true&amp;overlay=false&amp;overlay_position=bottom&amp;overlay_width=100,N,,2025-03-27 05:56:24.947430

“CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry.

“Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders.

“In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO.

“This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonisation of the principles on which all SAF registries operate,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice-president sustainability and chief economist.

“The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent and liquid global market for SAF.

“The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigour. Ramping-up SAF production is the common goal and the structure we are putting in place with CADO is an important step in moving decarbonisation forward,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SAF-registry-to-be-operated-pic-Fluid-27-3-768x512.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 06:56:21.211130
