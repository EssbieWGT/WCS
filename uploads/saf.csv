This marks an important step towards establishing methanol bunkering at large scale and driving Singapore’s ambition to become a sustainable multi-fuel bunkering hub.

Licences will be awarded to Global Energy Trading Pte Ltd, Golden Island Pte Ltd, and PetroChina International (Singapore) Pte Ltd. The three companies were selected from a total of 13 applicants through a comprehensive evaluation process that assessed supply chain reliability, operational readiness, safety systems, and the sustainability certification of the methanol volume to be supplied. The strong interest reflects the sector’s growing focus on lower-emission marine fuels.

The licences will be valid for a five-year period, from January 1, 2026 to December 31, 2030, subject to successful applicants meeting relevant licensing conditions. The five-year period supports the early development of methanol bunkering by giving licensees sufficient scope to build capabilities, strengthen supply chains, and anchor initial investments as the market develops.

The MPA will continue to review the licensing framework, incorporating operational experience, technological developments, and evolving international standards so that the framework remains demand-responsive, practical, robust, and aligned with global standards and development.

Chevron plans to market the hydrogen fuel produced by Raven’s Richmond plant in Northern California.
The facility initially sought a solid waste facility permit, but was discouraged from taking in food waste by officials who said that the material should be diverted to compost.
The Trump administration has also pulled back federal support for hydrogen fuel, forcing California’s hydrogen hub to pause operations after losing $1.2 billion in funding.
Once it’s operational, the Richmond facility can produce a hydrogen fuel that is priced competitively to traditional hydrocarbons, Murdock said.","Dive Brief:

Raven SR, which has piloted technology capable of producing hydrogen fuel from organic waste, received an air permit and authority to construct its first planned facility in Richmond, California, the company announced last week.

Raven partnered with Republic Services to site its $75 million facility on the closed West Contra Costa Sanitary Landfill. Raven’s facility will process up to 99 wet tons of biomass — including yard waste, agricultural residues and untreated construction wood, but not food waste — per day.

The facility is expected to produce up to 2,400 metric tons of hydrogen annually once operational. It still needs a final permit from Richmond, which CEO and cofounder Matt Murdock said should be straightforward to attain. He expects construction will begin on the facility early next year.

Dive Insight:

Raven, founded in 2018 and based in Wyoming, aims to commercialize the process of converting organic waste to synthetic gas and then to hydrogen fuel. Raven says its process is more efficient than competing forms of hydrogen fuel production and does not use fresh water — a priority in California.

Early investors included Samsung Ventures and Chevron New Energies, the latter of which holds a 50% equity stake in Raven SR, with other partners coming on in subsequent funding rounds. Chevron plans to market the hydrogen fuel produced by Raven’s Richmond plant in Northern California. Hyzon Motors, which produced the first operable hydrogen fuel cell refuse vehicle in the U.S., was also an early investor in Raven but has since gone out of business.

Murdock said he’s learned a lot by watching other hydrogen fuel ventures launch and fail in recent years. He said he’s learned two key lessons: don’t be dependent on government subsidies and don’t load your venture with debt. Raven is funded through equity agreements, he noted. And while the company expects to benefit from certain tax credits, Murdock said they’re not necessary to make the Richmond facility pencil out.

The facility itself will take about an acre and a half of space, with half of that space used for trucks delivering waste and picking up the final hydrogen fuel. Raven will process about 100 tons per day of material and produce about 60% to 70% of its own energy, the rest of which Murdock hopes to obtain from other renewable sources. The facility will produce about 2,400 metric tons of hydrogen annually.

Raven and Republic first announced their partnership in 2021. Raven leases its site from the waste company, and is set to receive all of its feedstock from Republic’s existing transfer station on the closed landfill site. A spokesperson for Republic Services declined to comment further on the partnership.

The more than three years it’s taken to get the project permitted is longer than Raven and its partners hoped, Murdock said. The facility initially sought a solid waste facility permit, but was discouraged from taking in food waste by officials who said that the material should be diverted to compost. Raven switched to obtain a biomass conversion facility permit instead.

Along the way, Raven has continued to refine its facility plans to maximize its efficiency. Murdock said there was a lot of excitement for hydrogen fueling when Raven first announced its California facility. But that excitement has cooled somewhat as renewable sources of the fuel remain few. The Trump administration has also pulled back federal support for hydrogen fuel, forcing California’s hydrogen hub to pause operations after losing $1.2 billion in funding.

With the launch of Raven’s facility, which the company expects will occur in 2027, Murdock hopes the pendulum will swing back toward hydrogen vehicles.

Once it’s operational, the Richmond facility can produce a hydrogen fuel that is priced competitively to traditional hydrocarbons, Murdock said. The company already has another facility in development in Spain, and is planning additional locations in the United States. He said the technology is straightforward to replicate at future sites, and can be modified to support the production of sustainable aviation fuel, methanol or other next-generation fuels that are seeing rising demand.

“If we can produce a low-cost hydrogen and get it into the market... that’s going to be a big deal,” Murdock said. “My hope is that we can start pushing the dominoes the other way, and people start coming back into the market.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/plgaO3UZQLlGr9bywpnj-gRI8W9jSIohMXDwwDCAuDA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9SYXZlbl9TUl9TLVNlcmllc19IaVJlc19Ob19LZXlfMV9sb2dvbGVzcy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-26 12:57:23.255303

GHG Protocol’s Actions and Market Instruments workstream is developing a multi-statement reporting structure to complement corporate GHG inventories. The initiative responds to the fact that many company actions, including investments in emission reduction or removal projects and the use of market instruments, may fall outside inventory boundaries and are not reflected in scope 1, scope 2, or scope 3 data. The new structure is designed to enable transparent and complete reporting of these impacts while keeping them separate from physical inventories. It aims to support decarbonisation investments across all sectors and address reporting for instruments such as virtual power purchase agreements, biomethane certificates, and sustainable aviation fuel. A multistakeholder Technical Working Group is developing the approach. A Phase 1 White Paper is underway, with public consultation planned for early 2026 and Phase 2 beginning later that year.

Experts link dollar dependence to green investment challenges

G20 think tanks urged countries to reduce the dominance of the U.S. dollar in the global economy. The discussions took place in Johannesburg ahead of the G20 summit, where major economies and the European Union meet to address global financial issues. The T20, a network of research institutes that provides policy advice to G20 leaders, endorsed a communique calling for a more diversified international financial architecture. The group said reliance on a single currency exposed countries in the Global South to external shocks and debt crises. It recommended promoting the use of local currencies in trade and finance, developing multi-currency cross-border payment systems, and expanding swap lines and multilateral development bank loans in local currencies. Bruno De Conti of Positive Money led the initiative and said dollar dependence limited investment capacity, including in renewable energy. The T20 also warned that delaying the launch of central bank digital currencies could increase dollarisation, noting that most Global South debt is denominated in dollars.

AI and revenues reshape 2025 sustainability strategy

Deloitte Global’s 2025 survey of more than 2,100 executives shows strong sustainability engagement, with AI playing an expanding role. Eighty-one per cent of respondents said they already use AI for monitoring, reporting, scenario analysis, product innovation, and operational efficiency. Revenue generation emerged as the most frequently cited business benefit of sustainability actions, ahead of compliance outcomes, brand and reputation, and risk and resiliency. Some activities declined compared to 2024: tying senior leader compensation to sustainability performance, requiring suppliers to meet sustainability standards, and reducing emissions through renewable energy purchases. Overall investment remains high, with 83% of executives increasing spending in the past year. The survey also shows reduced stakeholder pressure since 2022. It indicates that climate change is viewed as less disruptive in the near term. Organisations are reassessing their ambitions, resources, and risks as sustainability strategies continue to evolve.

UK NGO urges mandatory measures to stop nurdle spills

Fidra, a Scottish environmental charity, is calling on governments worldwide to introduce legislation that enforces strict good-practice requirements across the plastic supply chain, and urging the International Maritime Organisation to adopt robust mandatory rules to prevent nurdle losses at sea. The appeal follows findings that nurdles, tiny plastic pellets used in plastic production, were found at 168 of 195 UK sites of special scientific interest, meaning 84% of protected locations are contaminated. The pellets were also found in six national parks, including Loch Lomond & the Trossachs and the North York Moors. Nurdles are frequently spilt during production and transport, with an estimated 53 billion lost annually in the UK. Fidra highlighted risks linked to toxic chemicals and the creation of microplastics, which harm wildlife and enter the human food chain, stressing that these impacts stem from preventable industrial pollution.

The expectation is that HAL will submit a formal application for development consent after completion of the ANPS review process.
Alexander said: “Heathrow is our only hub airport which supports trade, tourism and hundreds of thousands of jobs, underpinning prosperity not only in the South East but across the UK.
Heathrow, currently serving as the UK’s main hub airport, processed 23.4 million passengers during the peak summer season.
These measures are intended to accommodate future traffic projections and synchronise with anticipated throughput from an expanded Heathrow by 2035.","Heathrow Airport Limited’s (HAL) proposal for a third runway will serve as the foundation for the next stage of Heathrow expansion, following confirmation from UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander.

This decision sets Heathrow’s scheme as the basis for the review of the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS), which guides planning and regulatory decisions for airport development in the UK.

Any proposed modifications to the ANPS will open for public and industry consultation in summer 2026, with subsequent parliamentary scrutiny.

The government selected HAL’s proposal after evaluating submissions from the remaining candidates last month, assessing deliverability and alignment with parliamentary timelines for a development consent decision.

The expectation is that HAL will submit a formal application for development consent after completion of the ANPS review process.

Review procedures are designed to incorporate updated environmental and climate change considerations into airport planning frameworks.

Alexander stated that she contacted the independent Climate Change Committee to request advice, specifically regarding the role of aviation in meeting the UK’s carbon budgets.

She also invited feedback on proposed updates to the ANPS to ensure it aligns with climate commitments.

The committee’s input will inform whether capacity increases are consistent with net zero obligations.

Alexander said: “Heathrow is our only hub airport which supports trade, tourism and hundreds of thousands of jobs, underpinning prosperity not only in the South East but across the UK.

“Today is another important step to enable a third runway and build on these benefits, setting the direction for the remainder of our work to get the policy framework in place for airport expansion.”

The Department for Transport has indicated that selection of HAL’s scheme does not amount to final approval for construction or detailed design. Elements such as runway length or configuration will remain subject to technical evaluation through the review period.

The government reiterated that expansion proposals must comply with national legal requirements relating to carbon emissions, air quality, and noise in addition to economic criteria.

Heathrow, currently serving as the UK’s main hub airport, processed 23.4 million passengers during the peak summer season.

Expansion is expected to address capacity demands and is positioned by authorities as a strategic move for supporting connectivity and international commerce.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said: “We’re taking action where previous governments hesitated, and moving forward with Heathrow’s third runway to drive economic growth, international investment and better connections for our country.”

Simultaneously, work is underway on national airspace modernisation efforts aimed at optimising aircraft routing efficiency and reducing operational emissions.

Updated Airspace Design Strategic Objectives specify that Greater London’s airspace, which is currently handling over 1.1 million movements annually, will take precedence in redesign processes.

These measures are intended to accommodate future traffic projections and synchronise with anticipated throughput from an expanded Heathrow by 2035.

A government consultation has also commenced on revisions to Air Navigation Guidance, focusing on clarifying regulatory priorities related to airspace changes while maintaining mechanisms for public engagement.

This update follows recent approvals for expansion projects at Luton and Gatwick airports.

On 6 November 2025, the Executive Committee of the Green, Social, Sustainability and Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles published a press release announcing new Climate Transition Guidelines alongside a new edition of the Climate Transition Handbook, with the help of the International Capital Market Association.

The guidelines introduce the use of Climate Transition Bonds (CTB), which can be used to finance climate transition projects through utilising the proceeds of the bonds. These projects work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the goals set out in the Paris Agreement.

The guidelines are intended to be used in conjunction with the handbook and set out four core components with which CTBs must align. These cover the use of proceeds, the process for the evaluation and selection of projects, the management of proceeds, and how project information should be reported.

Government consultation on the draft Climate Change Agreements (Energy-intensive Installations and Eligible Facilities) (Amendment) Regulations 2026

HM Revenue and Customs has published a consultation on the draft Climate Change Agreements (Energy-intensive Installations and Eligible Facilities) (Amendment) Regulations 2026. The regulations aim to bring three energy-intensive processes within scope of the climate change agreement (CCA). These are:

the mechanical recycling of plastic;

the packaging of spirits; and

the production of batteries for electric vehicles.

CCAs are voluntary agreements which commit sector associations and their members, who operate energy-intensive installations and facilities, to increase their energy efficiency or reduce their carbon emissions. In return, they will receive a reduced rate of the climate change levy (CCL).

From 1 January 2026 to 31 December 2030, sectors and operators will be required to enter into new CCAs with amended terms and new targets. Participants in the scheme will be eligible for reduced rates of CCL up to 31 March 2033.

The consultation will close on 2 December 2025, with the government intending to bring the changes into force by January 2027.

Government publishes consultation on proposals to accelerate the phasedown of HFCs

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has published a consultation on proposals to accelerate the phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in Great Britain. HFCs are an example of man-made fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases), which were introduced to replace chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). While F-gases (unlike CFCs) do not damage the ozone layer, they are powerful greenhouse gases with a global warming effect that is substantially larger than that of carbon dioxide.

The current proposals would accelerate the HFCs phasedown schedule to go further than the current target of cutting the amount coming onto the market by 79% by 2030. The aim is to achieve a phase-out of HFCs of 98.6% by 2048.

Environment Agency publishes new guidance on decarbonisation readiness under the Environmental Permitting Regime

The Environment Agency (EA) has published new guidance on decarbonisation readiness (DR) under the Environmental Permitting (EP) regime.

From 28 February 2026, operators of new and substantially refurbished combustion plants will be required to introduce a DR report as part of the EP application in England under the Environmental Permitting (Electricity Generating Stations) (Amendment) Regulations 2025 (SI 2025/154). Such plants are required to be built in a way that enables them to be decarbonised within their lifetime. This can either be by converting to hydrogen-firing or retrofit carbon capture technology. The regulations replace the requirements under the Carbon Capture Readiness (Electricity Generating Stations) Regulations 2013 (SI 2013/2969) in England.

The new guidance outlines how DR reports should be prepared under an EP application. The guidance:

clarifies the scope, exemptions and definitions;

reinforces its approach to proportionality and flexibility;

adds clarification boxes on transitioning to DR; and

gives further explanation on charging and how to update DR reports.

The EA has also published a consultation on proposals to change standard rules permits under the EP regime to reflect the new DR requirements. This consultation closes on 18 December 2025.

Government responds to consultation on changes to the network charging compensation scheme

The Department for Business and Trade has published the government response to its consultation on increasing the network charging compensation (NCC) scheme in support of energy-intensive industries. The NCC scheme forms part of a package of measures called the British Industry Supercharger, which aims to reduce carbon leakage by energy-intensive industries (EIIs). The NCC scheme offers relief to EIIs that hold a valid certificate under the EII exemption scheme by compensating them for a portion of their network charging costs.

The response to the consultation outlines that the government will:

increase the relief offered by the scheme from 60% to 90% from 1 April 2026; and

extend the application window for the scheme from one month to two months from 30 June 2026.

The response also suggests that the EII support levy will be increased from 1 April 2027 to cover the costs of the changes to the NCC scheme. Electricity suppliers will be given a six-month forecast of the increase in costs in October 2026. EIIs who submit a Q2 2026 claim will receive the uplifted compensation after April 2027.

Government publishes response to Climate Change Committee 2025 adaptation progress report

The Climate Change Committee (CCC) published its progress report in April 2025, assessing the extent to which the government's Third National Adaptation Programme (NAP3) and its implementation are preparing the UK for the impacts of climate change. Defra has now published the government's response to the report.

The government provided responses to the priority recommendations in the report relating to the key sectors of (i) land, (ii) nature and food, (iii) infrastructure, (iv) the built environment and communities, (v) health and well-being, and (vi) the economy. It also highlighted the steps taken by the government to build resilience to climate change risk since 2024.

The government responded to the CCC's recommended key areas of improvement to the NAP3 as follows:

It stated that it would publish a National Adaptation Programme Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Framework, to inform and improve data collection and reporting. This will guide objective development and plans for implementation ahead of NAP4.

It noted the work done on co-ordinating and integrating climate risk adaptation with wider resilience work, such as the Resilience Action Plan and the Chronic Risk Analysis.

It cited the updated supplementary Green Book guidance which considers the effects of climate change as an example of adaptation being integrated.

Government publishes updated Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan

The government has updated its Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan as part of a package of documents relating to the UK's net zero transition and energy security. The High Court had previously found the Carbon Budget Delivery Plan to be inadequate in May 2024, ordering the government to publish a revised plan. The updated plan has been published in response to this decision.

The government has stated that it ""builds on our action to accelerate clean, homegrown energy for the British people"". The emissions reduction targets set by the previous government have not changed under the updated plan.

The government has published a summary of the actions it is taking on clean energy and climate action to accompany the plan. This covers energy security and lower electricity bills, jobs and economic growth, quality of life and health and protecting the natural environment.

Supreme Court decision on nutrient neutrality and Habitats Regulations assessment requirements

On 22 October 2025, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in C G Fry & Son Ltd v Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government [2025] UKSC 35. This decision reaffirms the protections afforded to sites protected under the Habitats Regulations 2017.

The Supreme Court confirmed that the requirement to conduct an appropriate assessment could apply after the initial application for planning permission where sites are protected under the Habitat Regulations 2017. In doing so, the court highlighted ""the protective purpose of the Habitats Regulations"" and emphasised the importance of this.

The case has wider implications from a planning perspective, with the court setting out that a Local Planning Authority (LPA) is bound by specified planning conditions once an outline planning permission has been granted subject to those conditions. In making this decision, it confirmed that Ramsar sites are not protected by the Habitats Regulations as a matter of law. This may change if the current Planning and Infrastructure Bill before Parliament is implemented, which has just undergone its third reading in the House of Lords.

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero publishes independent review of greenhouse gas removals

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has published its independent review of greenhouse gas removals (GGRs). The increased use of GGRs is believed to help the UK meet its carbon budget and net zero targets under the Climate Change Act 2008.

The review offers five recommendations for the government to implement to facilitate GGR mechanisms in the UK, with options for GGR mechanisms including large-scale bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air carbon capture and storage. These recommendations include:

Developing a GGR strategy, identifying how GGR solutions can be used to help the UK meet its carbon budget and net zero targets. This strategy should outline the role for BECCS within this strategy, alongside a plan for maximising GGRs based on underutilised resources in the UK.

Minimising the UK's use of imported biomass feedstock, identifying ways in which UK sustainable feedstocks can be used as a basis for GGRs.

Renaming the sustainable aviation fuel mandate to the net zero aviation mandate. This mandate should be amended to ensure that all flights departing from the UK are climate neutral by 2045.

The review recommends that the UK should establish itself as an international leader on GGRs.

Welsh government plans to reform management of the water sector and Natural Resources Wales publishes consultation on water management in Wales

The deputy first minister for Wales, Huw Irranca-Davies, has announced the Welsh government's plans to reform the management of the water sector in response to the Independent Water Commission's final report.

The plans include the introduction of a new regulator for water in Wales. It also seeks powers that would allow Wales to legislate independently for the water industry. The Welsh government's aim is to progress regulation of the water sector ""towards an ethical, collaborative framework built on sustainability, affordability and fairness"". This will include introducing stronger environmental regulation, support for independent customer advocacy and exploration of an ombudsman for water in Wales, alongside economic regulations. There will be a consultation on the reforms later this year.

Also relevant to the Welsh water sector, Natural Resources Wales published a consultation on managing water quality in Wales using river basin management plans. This includes considering problems of flooding, pollution, invasive non-native species, nutrients, and the climate and nature emergencies. The consultation will close on 21 April 2026.

Government publishes consultation on strengthening civil sanctions for specified environmental offences by water companies

Defra has published a consultation on new penalties for water companies that commit environmental offences in England. The consultation seeks views on proposals which would allow the Environment Agency to impose variable monetary penalties (VMPs) on the basis of the civil standard of proof (""on the balance of probabilities"") rather than the criminal standard (""beyond reasonable doubt"") for certain moderate offences, essentially lowering the threshold for such penalty enforcement.

The revised standard would apply to offences under the regimes for environmental permitting, water abstraction, water impounding and drought. The proposals suggest that the maximum value of VMPs that could be imposed under the lower civil standard of proof would be £350,000 or £500,000.

Defra is also seeking views on requiring the EA to impose automatic fixed monetary penalties to the civil standard of proof for specific minor environmental offences. These would apply to specific environmental permitting or abstraction breaches, including a failure to report a significant pollution incident without four hours, breach of certain data requirements and using an emergency overflow more than three times a year. The consultation is seeking views on what the maximum level of the new automatic penalty should be.

The proposals under this consultation will require parliamentary approval of secondary legislation. The consultation will close on 3 December 2025.

Increased flexibilities for manufacturers in vehicle emissions trading schemes

The Vehicle Emissions Trading Schemes (Amendment) (No 2) Order 2025 (SI 2025/1101) (VETS No 2 Order 2025) comes into force on 1 January 2026, amending the Vehicle Emissions Trading Schemes Order 2023 (SI 2023/1394) (VETS Order 2023). The VETS Order 2023 set up four separate vehicle emission trading schemes, providing a route for phasing out new purely internal combustion engine vehicles, as all new cars and vans are to be fully zero emission by 2035.

The VETS No 2 Order implements the following amendments:

Providing manufacturers with additional routes to compliance, and allowing them greater flexibility to bank and borrow allowances and to convert over-compliance within one trading scheme to support them in complying with another.

Reducing the compliance payments payable where manufacturers fail to meet targets.

Implementing technical changes to assist manufacturers with treatment of plug-in hybrid vehicles.

The amendments are supported by guidance published by the Department for Transport, as well as an explanatory memorandum and policy note.

Government publishes a response to its consultation on Marine Recovery Fund for offshore wind developments

Defra has published the government response to its consultation on how the Marine Recovery Fund (MRF) will function in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The MRF aims to speed up the consenting process for offshore wind developments on Marine Protected Areas by introducing industry-funded measures to compensate for the adverse effects of such developments.

The response suggests that Defra:

will streamline the application process and issue guidance on how MRF delivers compensatory measures using a library of strategic compensatory measures; and

is working with the Scottish Government to ensure that Defra's MRF is aligned with the Scottish MRF.

The UK government will now draft the secondary legislation required to publish the MRF, while Defra will publish the accompanying guidance.",https://oc-static.poweredbyproctors.co.uk/public/styles/opengraph/public/images/23/01/25/Reg-Outlook-1000px_Jan-2023_environment-insight.png?VersionId=uRNCoWU6ItYwxukGks4FGeaXrDICGSjY&itok=v3YaMiuc,N,,2025-11-26 14:56:13.826172

U.S. farmland has rarely been as closely watched as it is today. After several years of rapid appreciation and inflation-linked gains, values appear to be entering a different phase, one marked by cooler growth, greater regional divergence and a closer tether to underlying income performance. MetLife Investment Management’s 2025 farmland outlook, entitled “The Road Ahead: U.S. Farmland Value Forecasts,” captures this shift in detail, noting that while average land appreciation remains positive, headwinds like high input costs, softer commodity prices and tighter margins are expected to challenge row-crop profitability in the near term.

Against this backdrop, MetLife Investment Management forecasts moderation rather than contraction at the national level, with some regions poised for further gains, particularly the Delta states (Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana) and Lake region, while others face mild declines as fundamentals recalibrate. The report also highlights a record-low cropland rent-to-value ratio of 2.8 percent, highlighting the extent to which appreciation, rather than income, has driven total returns over the past decade.

To unpack these findings, David J. Williams, PhD, Head of Agricultural Research & Strategy at MetLife Investment Management and co-author of the report, spent some time with GAI News. In the following Q&A, Williams shares his perspective on where U.S. farmland values may be headed through 2030, which regions he is watching most closely and how investors should think about risk and opportunity in this cooling but steadfastly resilient market.

1.) GAI News: MetLife Investment Management’s U.S. farmland value forecast points to both long-term tailwinds for U.S. agriculture (rising population, expanding middle class, strong demand for proteins, renewable fuel demand, etc.) as well as near-term headwinds from forces such as softer crop values, painfully elevated input costs, higher interest rates and trade war uncertainty. As you look out to the next three-to-five years, which of these forces do you see as most decisive for farmland values, and what should investors in U.S. farmland be paying closest attention to right now?

David J. Williams: “Among the many moving pieces shaping U.S. farmland values, input expenses stand out as perhaps the most important factor over the next several years. While there’s understandable concern around softer and fluctuating commodity prices, it’s important to recognize that the actual impacts on farm incomes can be quite disparate across the entire Ag landscape. When the prices of major row crops dip, there’s often a plus side for livestock and protein production, since much of that grain goes into animal feed. Similarly, some specialty crops aren’t experiencing the same pressures as row crops, so a blanket statement about prices misses some important nuance. In contrast, input costs like fertilizer, fuel, seed, and machinery have risen across the entire agricultural sector and show little sign of rapidly retreating to pre-pandemic levels. This pressure is felt by virtually every producer, regardless of what crop they’re growing. Easing in these costs would deliver broad-based relief and improve profitability without the side effects of shifting margins from one segment to another.”

2.) GAI News: Your analysis highlights U.S. farmland as a resilient investment that has outpaced inflation, with appreciation contributing over half of cropland returns in the past decade. However, rents have lagged, leading to a historic low for the national average rent-to-value ratio of 2.8 percent and influencing total returns more toward land appreciation than income. This trend seems to persist in the face of tight farmland margins (owning to lower commodity prices and elevated input costs.) Is this trend worrying, and do you expect this divergence between farmland appreciation and rents to persist? If so, could you weigh in on how it might influence investor strategies, such as focusing on regions with stronger cash flows or incorporating additional revenue sources like carbon credits or renewable energy leases?

David J. Williams: “I would say I’m a bit more concerned but not necessarily seeing this trend as a worry today. At a certain point, something has to give, and farmland investment returns need to be drawn from the tangible benefits that the land provides and not just the willingness of someone else to pay more for it later. If we continue to see above average increases in farmland values without a corresponding increase in profitability and rents, then we need to start asking tough questions about how far out of line valuations could become from profitability and what it would take to realign the two.

“As our report indicates, we expect a period of moderation in appreciation and localized declines in specific regions, and I think that cooling in farmland values could be good for the sector in that it would allow for profitability to catch up with valuations. That said, if the trend of compressing cap rates did continue, it would be because investors were willing to pay an increasingly large premium for the diversification benefits and low correlations that farmland provides.

“As for the trend’s implications on potential investment strategy, it will encourage more landowners to consider those lucrative renewable energy lease agreements. We continue to see long-term lease offers in the market that are multiples over the cash rental rates that farm operators will pay. Seeing more acres pulled out of production would also benefit those that weren’t offered a lease as it would result in less production and less competition in the crops that land could produce.”

3.) GAI News: The report points out that row crop returns are leaning more on land value growth than on steady income these days, especially with farmers facing squeezed profits from lower commodity prices and high input costs. Meanwhile, permanent crops in places like the Central Valley are dealing with challenges from water regulations and shifting profits. For institutional investors thinking about where to put their money next, what are the main risk differences and opportunities between row and permanent crops that they should focus on, and do you think we’ll see those gaps narrow or widen as demand for specialty crops like almonds, pistachios, grapes keeps rising?

David J. Williams: “Institutional investors deciding whether to invest in permanent crops or row crops should carefully think about their risk tolerances and return objectives. If you just want a safe low correlation asset and you’re relatively risk averse, then annual cropland is the way to go. If you’re looking for the possibility of above average returns, then permanent crops need to be discussed, but those expected returns come at a cost.

“The risk profile for permanent crops and row crops are very different. The costs to establish an orchard, or purchase one that’s already been established, can amount to multiples over the raw land value. And once established, the value of those biological assets will fluctuate with the profitability of the commodity and may be entirely wiped out if water becomes uneconomical. But that added risk comes with the opportunity for lucrative returns when market fundamentals are in balance.

“My primary concern with permanent crops is the possibility of a supply overhang caused by too many investors planting at one time in the pursuit of high commodity prices. If demand growth doesn’t match that increase in supply, a few years down the line you could have low prices and eventually very costly exits. In the commercial real estate sector this sometimes happens due to apartments taking several years to construct and lease-up, during which time many other developers may be breaking ground. For a permanent crop segment like apples, it can take five years or longer from planting to get full harvests.

“But when the supply side becomes more-or-less fixed, such as what’s happening in the Central Value due to the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), that downside becomes less of a concern. I believe those landowners that had parcels least affected by SGMA and that survive the transition will have the most effective barrier to entry they could ask for that will serve them well in the long run.”

4.) GAI News: Your analysis shows clear regional splits in U.S. farmland appreciation through 2030, with spots like the Delta States and Lake States seemingly well positioned for gains, while areas such as the Northern Plains and Mountain regions could face pullbacks. What do you see as the biggest factors driving these regional variances, and how should investors think about allocating capital when the market is becoming more of a patchwork than a nationwide trend?

David J. Williams: “There were numerous factors that went into determining our outlook, but one of the most significant in explaining the regional variation was trade exposure and relative reliance on foreign export markets. With the recent U.S. – China trade framework we have a lot more clarity on what the trade situation is going to look like over the next several years. The Chinese purchase commitments of 25 million metric tons of soybeans is actually a bit below the historical average. While it’s clear that the 25 MMT is a floor and theoretically we could see an increase, without concrete details on how or why that would happen I wouldn’t assume that we would see an increase in exports at this point in time. The region performing the weakest in our forecast, the Northern Plains, is forecast to decline in part due to the region’s high reliance on shipping by rail to Pacific Northwest ports for final export to China. For the investor, it’s important to understand that while the commodities being grown across the country might look identical, the cash prices and basis can vary significantly due to differences in local supply and demand, and to understand what risks you want to be more or less exposed to.”

5.) GAI News: What stands out to you as the most surprising part of this year’s farmland value outlook and what is bigger investor takeaway?

David J. Williams: “Our expectation of moderation in farmland appreciation is in large part due to the ongoing state of high supplies of major row crops. But there is huge demand potential for grains and oilseeds in the long run through sustainable aviation fuel and higher ethanol blend rates. Brazil is a leader in biofuel usage, with a 30 percent ethanol blend rate – triple the U.S. average. A 30 percent ethanol blend rate in the U.S. would require an additional 11 billion bushels of corn each year. Replacing all domestic aviation fuel usage with ethanol-to-jet based sustainable aviation fuel would require approximately 12.5 billion bushels of corn each year. These are huge numbers that could bolster the sector while reducing its vulnerability to foreign export markets.

“While these demand sources require policy change, and political support for them vary administration to administration, I see them as inevitable. Fossil fuels are a finite resource, and we will run out of them, or exhaust them to the point of economic infeasibility, eventually, and there will always be a need for fuels with the energy density that batteries cannot achieve. Crop yields will continue to increase with technological advancements, and the U.S. will lead the way in expanding global production levels. Over the last 50 years the U.S. average corn yield has more than doubled, from 86.4 to 186 bushels per acre, and they’ll continue to increase. These fuels will be key to providing a use for all those crops – eventually.”

Airbus’ sustainability principles

Airbus has set sustainability targets which have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), as detailed in its 2025 Pioneering Sustainable Aviation report.

The company aims to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 63% by 2030 and neutralise residual emissions.

It also aims to cut its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 46% by 2035, compared to a 2015 baseline year.

One of its top priorities in its operations is safety, for its employees, products and services.

Its aircraft, helicopters, satellites and other technologies meet strict regulatory requirements and incorporate safety into its design, testing and production.

Airbus is helping the aerospace industry to reach its long-term goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.

Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus, says: “This means expanding production of these new, fuel-efficient aircraft to help airlines accelerate the renewal of their fleets.

“With partners from across the world, Airbus is advocating for and investing in sustainable aviation fuels, which are critical to making progress in reducing emissions today.

“Our core principles of safety, quality, integrity, compliance and security will guide us in all we do.”

The energy transition in aviation

Airbus has developed a decarbonisation roadmap to help support the energy transition.

The company is aiming to increase the uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) across the industry.

Its aircraft are already capable of flying on a blend of up to 50% SAF and conventional fuel and it plans to make all of its aircraft and helicopters able to fly with up to 100% SAF by 2030.

Using SAF provides a potential reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of up to 80% throughout its lifecycle when compared to kerosene, according to the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

Airbus is working closely with fuel producers, airlines, governments and researchers to accelerate SAF production and increase its availability.

Promoting a lifecycle approach

Airbus designs its products with circularity in mind, building them to last for more than 20 years.

The company aims to reduce environmental impacts across its operations and supply chains.

It has been working on building resilience into its supply chain, starting with sourcing its materials up until its products’ end of life.

Airbus aims to minimise waste and raw material use to extend the lifespan of its services and products and encourages its customers and partners to do the same.

Its target is to reduce its waste collection by 20% and have 0% landfilling and incineration without energy recovery by 2030, compared to 2015 levels.

Julie Kitcher, Chief Sustainability Officer at Airbus, says: “We want to do business in a way that benefits society as a whole.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b8ca38c972e9f9d52119202571a93dac:d0b3b4ad50bd7063173a0b6157e2346a/airbus-beluga-plane.JPG.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 10:58:13.660987

With the help of advanced computer programs, bioenergy researchers can now make better predictions by looking at lots of complex data and finding patterns.
Focus on corn stover The INL team processed corn stover, which is the stalks, leaves, husks and cobs left over after corn is harvested.
From there, Xia’s team conducted biomass size reduction experiments with the PDU’s knife mill.
“Our industry partners have the expertise, but they might not be able to afford the sophisticated hardware and software tools needed to conduct this kind of research,” Xia said.","Turning materials like wood chips, crop residues and municipal solid waste into fuels and chemicals is important for our country’s energy independence.

Over the past two decades, the U.S. Department of Energy Bioenergy Technologies Office laid out ambitious goals for processing these biomass resources into useful, affordable industrial fuels and feedstocks.

However, figuring out how to make small pieces of biomass flow easily through machinery during processing remains a challenge. When machines get clogged, it leads to delays and increased costs. While grinding, milling and pelletizing have been done for decades with food, minerals and pharmaceuticals, there has been little research into how technologies and processes can be adapted to handle plant materials and municipal solid waste. Now, researchers at the Idaho National Laboratory have developed computer models that apply to processing bioenergy crops using equipment from those other industries.

BETO funded the project through the Feedstock-Conversion Interface Consortium. With the help of advanced computer programs, bioenergy researchers can now make better predictions by looking at lots of complex data and finding patterns.

“It helps engineers design better milling approaches that are more energy efficient and effective,” said Yidong Xia, senior research scientist in INL’s Physical Process Science and Realization group. In three journal articles, Xia and his colleagues detailed how existing and emerging computational tools can be used to solve challenges related to feedstock particle size, distribution and thermochemical conversion.

Focus on corn stover

The INL team processed corn stover, which is the stalks, leaves, husks and cobs left over after corn is harvested. Researchers used special cutting techniques to turn corn stover into material that can be processed evenly. Unlike rocks and powders, which can be milled into relative uniformity because of their density and rigidity, the material properties of individual biomass particles have complicated internal and surface structures. Inside industrial-scale biomass silos and screw conveyors, there can be millions of particles with a wide range of geometries and properties.

Located in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Biomass Feedstock National User Facility, INL’s Process Development Unit lets researchers and industry partners test grinding, drying, pelletizing and other mechanical and chemical separation options during the design and scale-up of bioenergy facilities.

“Our purpose is to share our expertise and facilities to help our industry partners better understand the complex interactions that go on at industrial scales,” said Damon Hartley, a senior bioenergy research scientist. “This provides simplified and actionable information that can be utilized to improve operational performance.”

Faster estimates for guiding physical operations

Their April 2022 paper in Biosystems Engineering detailed the elastoplastic flexural behavior known as elastoplasticity of corn stalks. Elastoplasticity describes how a material that is both elastic (returns to its original shape) and plastic (permanently deforms) bends under a load. A December 2023 follow-up paper in Biosystems Engineering detailed how discrete element method modeling revealed that while stalk length had little influence on particle size, larger cross sections generated larger milled particles. From there, Xia’s team conducted biomass size reduction experiments with the PDU’s knife mill. The study published in May 2024 in Powder Technology shows how using advanced computer models can help predict and recommend the best settings for equipment to reduce the size of particles.

The experiments provided insight into how fast estimates of particle size distribution can be used to guide physical operations. A model’s accuracy depends on the quality of the source data from physical testing. The more source data there is, the more reliable the model.

“First, we measure the cornstalks’ biomechanical properties,” Xia said. “Then we mill the material in the PDU to generate reference data as the basis to create a (discrete element method) simulation. From there, we can verify the data for use in fast predictive machine learning models.”

Assessing the data

Researchers found that the speed and power of the knife mill had minimal impact. Instead, the discharge screen size and moisture content played much more significant roles. With data in hand, the INL team developed a more comprehensive mathematical framework for predicting the evolution of particle size by adding moisture as a new input. Likewise, the deep neural operator model they developed allowed for influencing factors such as moisture content. Both models proved to be “remarkably accurate” in calibrating and defining training parameters.

“Large-scale physical testing is expensive and is a common challenge for scale-up engineering,” Xia said. “The more data we have ahead of time, and the more detail we have, the better our results are likely to be when we finally engage in large-scale testing.”

It’s a win-win for industry and BETO.

“Our industry partners have the expertise, but they might not be able to afford the sophisticated hardware and software tools needed to conduct this kind of research,” Xia said. “This is what national laboratories do. We’re here to help them optimize their processes and procedures, to help them be more successful. With the work we do, we hope to attract their interest and have them recognize our capabilities.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/INL_Nov25_1557f37af1.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 12:57:43.380555

He proudly pointed to a significant milestone: the first-ever sustainable aviation fuel facility using ethanol as its feedstock was built in Soperton, Georgia, and has recently reached commercial-scale production.","Geoff Cooper, CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), spoke with Intern Karleigh Erramouspe about the current market dynamics for U.S. ethanol, revealing record-setting export levels and highlighting a major new opportunity in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Legislative Roadblocks for E15

Cooper began by outlining the core function of the RFA: representing U.S. ethanol producers, who convert corn and grain sorghum into ethanol, and giving the industry a unified voice across the country.

The biggest hurdle for expanding domestic E15 sales (a blend of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline) remains legislative uncertainty. Currently, roughly 70% of the country cannot sell E15 year-round without a last-minute emergency waiver from the EPA.

“Really the biggest hurdle currently for nationwide year-round sales of E15 is we still don’t have legislation that allows the fuel to be sold year-round,” Cooper said.

This lack of certainty creates a massive disincentive for retailers to invest in the necessary infrastructure.

“If we don’t know whether we can sell this fuel year-round, you know, 365 days a year, we’re not going to make the investment in the infrastructure… to offer this product, if we can’t sell it every day of the year,” he explained, summarizing the retailer’s dilemma.

To solve this, Cooper stressed the urgent need for Congress to pass legislation allowing year-round E15 sales before the end of the year.

Record Exports and Trade Success

In stark contrast to the domestic regulatory hurdles, the ethanol industry is celebrating unprecedented success in the global marketplace.

“We’re actually seeing record exports in the ethanol industry. We’re expecting that this year about 2.4 billion gallons of ethanol will be exported, that will be an all-time record,” Cooper revealed.

This record volume means approximately 13% or 14% of total U.S. production is being exported.

Cooper noted that the industry has not seen adverse effects from recent tariff and trade disputes. In fact, ethanol has been front and center in the U.S. government’s trade negotiations. He specifically highlighted a recent success:

“The showpiece of that is is the trade deal that was done with the U.K. [United Kingdom]. The United Kingdom deal included a nice provision for ethanol that really expands our access to that market.”

A Huge Opportunity in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

The most exciting development for the industry is the emergence of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which promises to open an entirely new sector for corn-based ethanol.

Cooper detailed how ethanol is now being used as the foundational component for cleaner jet fuel.

“One of the things we’re we’re very focused on in the industry today is taking ethanol and using it as the building block for sustainable aviation fuel,” he said.

He proudly pointed to a significant milestone: the first-ever sustainable aviation fuel facility using ethanol as its feedstock was built in Soperton, Georgia, and has recently reached commercial-scale production.

“We think that’s a great sign and and and points to a bright future for the use of ethanol in the aviation sector,” Cooper concluded, noting that this is not a market the industry has previously played in, making it a “potentially a huge market opportunity” for ethanol producers and corn growers.",,N,,2025-11-26 10:58:17.707627

Producers must be able to show, with meters and records, that the amount of sustainable input matches the amount of sustainable fuel produced.
EU RED sets a high bar, and meeting it can be challenging, especially for emerging companies.","Imagine stepping into a plane that runs on recycled emissions, renewable electricity and water. That’s not a distant dream, but a direction aviation is moving in. Starting in 2030, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation requires that a share of all jet fuel used at EU airports must be synthetic, electricity-based sustainable aviation fuel called eSAF.

To ensure this fuel truly cuts emissions, the EU RED sets clear rules for how eSAF must be produced. These include strict control of supply chains, transparent tracking of sustainable materials, verified life-cycle emissions calculations, and a requirement that eSAF cuts emissions by at least 70 per cent compared to fossil-based jet fuel. In practice, this means eSAF producers must be certified before they can sell fuel in the EU.

Certified from source to sky

EU RED certification rests on three key requirements: sourcing sustainable inputs from approved suppliers, tracking material flows accurately through mass-balance, and verifying emissions across the full lifecycle.

Supply chain requirements

Every sustainable input used to produce eSAF, like captured biogenic CO₂ and green hydrogen, must come from EU RED-certified suppliers. Electricity providers don’t need certification themselves, but the electricity used must be genuinely renewable and, in many cases, meet strict criteria like being newly built, produced at the same time the fuel is made, and generated in the same region. These checks prevent eSAF production from competing with other sectors for renewable power.

Mass-balance tracking

In simple terms, the mass balance approach means that what goes in and what comes out during the production process is strictly accounted for. Producers must be able to show, with meters and records, that the amount of sustainable input matches the amount of sustainable fuel produced. This avoids situations where more “green” fuel is claimed than what is actually created.

Life-cycle emissions

To ensure real climate benefit, emissions are calculated across the whole journey from raw materials to fuel production, transport and final use. EU RED requires that eSAF cuts emissions by at least 70 per cent compared to fossil jet fuel, based on a standard EU formula.

Liquid Sun's path to certification

We have taken our first major step by becoming a member of the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) Association, one of the EU-approved schemes for demonstrating compliance with the EU RED. ISCC is widely trusted in the aviation and renewable energy sectors, making it a strong fit for our mission.

EU RED sets a high bar, and meeting it can be challenging, especially for emerging companies. But by joining ISCC early, we can build compliance into our processes from day one rather than retrofitting later. It gives us time to understand requirements, create the right systems and prepare for rigorous audits.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b87f17_48a13a0fb72e4d7392d0f19c6f5afd99~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_500,h_500,al_c,q_80/b87f17_48a13a0fb72e4d7392d0f19c6f5afd99~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-11-26 13:56:23.818849

Virgin Atlantic CEO Salary FAQs Stay tuned with us.","Virgin Atlantic (VS), one of the UK’s most iconic airlines, has always stood out for its flair, service, and daring marketing. Founded by Sir Richard Branson in 1984, it remains a symbol of British entrepreneurial spirit.

The airline’s story over the last few years, however, has been one of steady resilience rather than glamour. Having battled through the pandemic and rising fuel costs, Virgin Atlantic has managed to claw its way back to profitability under the leadership of Shai Weiss, who has been at the helm since 2019.

In 2024, the carrier recorded its first profit since 2019, reporting a £20 million pre-tax profit and revenues of £3.3 billion. The performance came on the back of strong demand on transatlantic routes, where Virgin Atlantic operates alongside its joint venture partners Delta Air Lines, Air France, and KLM.

Its operational fleet of around 42 aircraft, largely made up of Airbus A330s, A350s, and Boeing 787 Dreamliners, forms the core of a long-haul network connecting London to destinations across North America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia.

As the airline continues to stabilise, much attention has turned to the man guiding its comeback and, naturally, to how he’s compensated for the task.

Who is Shai Weiss?

Shai Weiss, originally from Israel, has been with Virgin Atlantic since 2014, starting as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) before being promoted to Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in 2019.

He previously held senior roles at Virgin Media and several investment firms, building his background across finance and management. Educated in both Israel and the United States, he holds an MBA from Columbia Business School.

Within Virgin Atlantic, Weiss is known for his pragmatic leadership and calm temperament, traits that proved vital during the pandemic years when the airline’s survival was in question.

His decision-making was instrumental in securing refinancing deals and driving the restructuring plan that saved thousands of jobs. Weiss is also known for his balanced approach — a mix of financial discipline and the brand’s characteristic optimism.

Virgin Atlantic CEO Shai Weiss’ Salary in 2025

As of the most recent disclosures, Shai Weiss’s base salary remains around £700,000 per year, consistent with his reported compensation since 2022. His performance-based bonus potential can reach up to £1.05 million, depending on how the airline performs financially and operationally.

Virgin Atlantic has not yet released a detailed remuneration report for the 2025 financial year. However, considering the airline’s return to profitability in 2024 and its positive earnings outlook, it’s expected that Weiss’s bonus component will have been partly or fully activated.

Based on comparable pay structures from previous years, his total estimated remuneration for 2025 likely falls between £1.2 million and £1.4 million, assuming moderate incentive payouts.

His package includes standard executive benefits such as health insurance, company car allowance, travel privileges, and participation in Virgin Group’s long-term incentive plan. Unlike some of his peers in low-cost or larger network airlines, Weiss’s compensation structure is heavily tied to long-term profitability rather than short-term stock bonuses.

Peer Comparisons: British Airways and easyJet

To understand Weiss’s compensation in context, it’s worth looking at two of his UK-based counterparts: Sean Doyle, CEO of British Airways, and Kenton Jarvis, CEO of easyJet.

Sean Doyle (British Airways) reportedly earned around £1.4 million in total remuneration in 2024, including a base salary of about £670,000 and bonus incentives.

BA’s size, being part of the International Airlines Group (IAG), naturally justifies a larger total pay envelope. The group’s profitability and global scale are also far higher than Virgin Atlantic’s.

Kenton Jarvis (easyJet), who assumed the CEO position in January 2025, earns a base salary of £800,000, with performance bonuses and share-based incentives tied to the airline’s financial results. His package is slightly higher on the fixed pay side but carries similar proportions in bonus opportunities.

Compared with these, Shai Weiss’s total compensation is competitive but restrained. Virgin Atlantic is smaller than both British Airways and easyJet in fleet and network scale, so the relative positioning of Weiss’s salary makes sense. What stands out is that his pay is deeply performance-weighted — an approach reflecting the airline’s cautious recovery and investor expectations.

Governance and Pay Structure

Virgin Atlantic’s remuneration philosophy has always leaned towards balance. As a privately held company (jointly owned by the Virgin Group with 51%, Delta Air Lines with 49%, and Air France-KLM with a small stake), its executive compensation is not subject to the same level of public scrutiny as listed airlines. Still, the board maintains a framework that rewards leadership stability and long-term financial health rather than large annual bonuses.

Following the challenges of 2020–2022, Weiss voluntarily waived parts of his pay and bonus when the airline was undergoing restructuring. That gesture earned him goodwill both internally and externally, reinforcing his image as a steady and grounded leader.

Since then, the company has re-aligned its bonus metrics towards profitability, cash flow, and operational reliability — three areas Weiss has openly prioritised. His pay for 2025, while not officially disclosed in full, is expected to reflect these performance goals more than headline figures.

Virgin Atlantic’s Plans for 2025

Looking ahead, Virgin Atlantic’s 2025 plans centre around sustainable expansion and financial strengthening. The airline is ramping up capacity on transatlantic routes, especially to the United States, where demand has remained robust.

It has also resumed services to key leisure destinations such as Dubai, Miami, and the Caribbean islands, while considering further frequency increases to India and South Africa.

Fleet modernisation continues, with the Airbus A330neo now joining the lineup, promising improved fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Sustainability sits at the heart of the company’s plans — Virgin Atlantic completed the world’s first 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) transatlantic flight in 2023 and is pushing forward with similar initiatives.

Operationally, the goal for 2025 is to achieve a stronger profit margin, improve punctuality, and manage rising fuel and maintenance costs. For Weiss, these objectives will directly influence any variable pay outcomes at the end of the fiscal year.

Bottom Line

Shai Weiss’s leadership has quietly stabilised Virgin Atlantic after a period of crisis and uncertainty. His pay structure reflects that measured, responsible approach — steady fixed compensation, and bonuses linked directly to the airline’s success. While not excessive by industry standards, it’s a fair reflection of the airline’s size, recovery stage, and ownership structure.

As Virgin Atlantic eyes a stronger 2025, Weiss’s role remains pivotal. His pay may not make headlines, but it symbolises a balance between ambition and realism — a fitting representation of how the airline itself has rebuilt from turbulence to renewed optimism.

This decision, which came into effect on Tuesday, November 25, 2025, marks the conclusion of an extensive investigation launched in June 2024 following an application by the Renewable Transport Fuels Association (RTFA).

The TRA's investigation determined that Chinese biodiesel was being ""dumped"" in the UK market—a practice that was found to be causing ""material injury"" to UK-based producers, including major industry players such as Argent Energy and Olleco.

The new measures are structured as ad valorem duties, which are calculated as a percentage of the value of the imported goods. The rates vary based on the level of cooperation shown by the exporting companies during the investigation:

• 14.79% for the Zhuoyue Group and other non-sampled cooperating exporters.

• 54.64% for all other exporters from China.

The application of these duties is broad, covering key types of biodiesel: fatty-acid mono-alkylesters (FAME) and paraffinic gasoils obtained from synthesis or hydrotreatment of non-fossil origin (HVO), whether imported in pure form or as part of a blend. This move aims to secure fair competition across the renewable road transport fuel sector.

Crucially, in a nod to future sustainability goals, the duties explicitly exclude sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), in pure form or in a blend.

The final recommendation by the TRA confirmed that applying an anti-dumping measure is decisively in the UK's economic interest. The authority's findings were based on a thorough analysis of evidence and responses from interested parties following the publication of the Statement of Essential Facts.

By raising the cost floor for these particular Chinese imports, the UK government is signaling a commitment to protecting domestic manufacturing capacity and fostering a stable investment environment for companies dedicated to the renewable fuel market.

To boost SAF production, Pertamina is working to increase the proportion of used cooking oil in its blends.
“This can also be achieved by increasing the capacity and productivity of the green refinery unit.” Indonesia has significant potential supply.
The country uses about 6 to 7 million tonnes of cooking oil each year, said Pertamina deputy president director Oki Muraza.
“In the beginning, we collected around 80 kg to 100 kg of used cooking oil a month.","Cilacap: Indonesia’s state-owned energy company Pertamina is intensifying efforts to scale up production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as part of the country’s broader plan to reduce carbon emissions from air travel, reports Channel News India.

Pertamina is expanding SAF output at its existing refineries and is studying the development of new green refineries. At present, SAF is produced at the company’s Cilacap refinery in Central Java, while green refinery capabilities are being developed or planned at facilities in South Sumatra, Riau, West Java and East Kalimantan.

The Indonesian government aims to raise the national SAF blend mandate for international flights to 5% by 2035. At the COP30 climate conference in Belem, Brazil, the country announced a target of producing more than 1 million kilolitres of SAF annually by 2030, with used cooking oil set to be a major feedstock.

At Cilacap, the green refinery under development can produce about 1.4 million litres of SAF a day — roughly half the volume of an Olympic-size swimming pool. Around 3% of the feedstock currently comes from used cooking oil.

The refinery converts used cooking oil into SAF using a series of chemical processes. The oil is mixed with kerosene, heated to about 70°C and then moved into a reactor where it is further heated to over 300°C and passed through layers of catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions. Hydrogen is also added to stabilise the mixture. The result is a cleaner fuel suitable for jet engines, which can cut aviation emissions by up to 80% compared with conventional jet fuel.

To boost SAF production, Pertamina is working to increase the proportion of used cooking oil in its blends. Engineers are also experimenting with improved catalysts to raise efficiency. The current catalyst was developed locally by Pertamina’s technology innovation team in collaboration with the Bandung Institute of Technology, as part of a national effort to reduce reliance on imported catalysts.

“Our research and development team is always trying to improve the catalyst so that the used cooking oil content can be increased to more than 3%,” said process engineer Novan Adhi Prakasa. “This can also be achieved by increasing the capacity and productivity of the green refinery unit.”

Indonesia has significant potential supply. The country uses about 6 to 7 million tonnes of cooking oil each year, said Pertamina deputy president director Oki Muraza. “If we could collect just 20% of that, like in developed countries, we would have a large amount of raw material — enough to supply the domestic industry.”

Communities are already contributing to the SAF supply chain. In the Tegalreja district near the Cilacap refinery, residents are selling their used cooking oil to local waste banks instead of discarding it. Each kilogram earns around US$0.30.

“Used cooking oil is something every household has. Selling it adds to our income. Even if it’s just a little, it helps,” said Bartinah, a resident of KB Gadis village. “It gives us motivation and hope that one day the price could rise even higher, maybe up to 10,000 rupiah (US$0.60) per kilogram.”

Indonesia has an estimated potential of around 1 million litres of used cooking oil annually, but nearly 95% of it is exported to Europe and other Asian markets. Local collection initiatives could redirect more of this toward domestic SAF production.

“In the beginning, we collected around 80 kg to 100 kg of used cooking oil a month. Now, it’s up to about 170 kg,” said Sri Widowati, coordinator of the Tegalreja Waste Bank.

This expanding community involvement, combined with Pertamina’s refinery upgrades, is expected to play a central role in Indonesia’s push to build a robust and scalable SAF ecosystem.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-9.png,N,,2025-11-26 08:57:18.350549

The company's Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Soperton, Georgia, is now fully operational, marking the first time its alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology has been deployed at a commercial scale following 15 years of research and development.

The fuel produced at the Georgia facility is a ‘drop-in’ solution, meaning it is fully compatible with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure and can be used as a direct replacement for traditional jet fuels.

This development could play a role in reducing the carbon footprint of the aviation industry. LanzaJet’s achievement is also notable as it represents the first time a non-oil-based renewable fuel of this type has reached commercial production levels.

Alcohol-to-jet manufacturing

Industry analysts have noted that SAF production using Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) may be nearing a limit based on feedstock availability. LanzaJet's technology offers an alternative pathway.

LanzaJet's proprietary process utilises widely available ethanol feedstocks, including agricultural residues and municipal solid waste, to bypass potential supply chain bottlenecks.

By focusing on ethanol, this technology could open up new avenues for waste and recycled carbon to be used in aviation fuel production.

""LanzaJet had made history: producing jet fuel from ethanol at the world's first commercial-scale plant,"" says Flyn van Ewijk, Regional Director for APAC at LanzaJet.

""This moment is not only hugely important for the LanzaJet family – the culmination of 15 years of research and development, collaboration, investment, and scale-up – but also for our industry as it marks the next wave of SAF technology to reach commercial readiness in nearly a decade.""

Scaling production with integrated technologies

LanzaJet refers to the Soperton plant as a ""first-of-its-kind"" integrated solution. The manufacturing process combines Technip Energies’ Hummingbird Ethanol-to-Ethylene technology with an oligomerisation process developed jointly by LanzaTech and the US Department of Energy.

The successful integration and troubleshooting of these technologies at the facility now serves as a blueprint for future deployments globally.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO at LanzaJet, comments: ""Today proves what happens when you bring together innovation, resilience, ingenuity and teamwork to think big and develop a new industry, overcome challenges and enable global growth.

“We’re now in a unique position with technology and operational know-how to shape this global industry in the decade ahead.”

Global implications for fuel manufacturing

LanzaJet is already working to deliver this manufacturing technology to several other regions, including the UK, the European Union, Japan, and Australia.

The move towards ethanol-based fuel production could offer nations a way to enhance their domestic energy security while also supporting their agricultural sectors.

The fuel produced through this process delivers substantially lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions when compared to conventional kerosene.

Flyn acknowledges the operational challenges faced during the project's development: ""Deploying a first-of-its-kind is not easy, but we've done it.

""I'm proud of our team for what they have achieved and grateful for Jimmy Samartzis's leadership and to Louay Masarweh for his many sleepless nights and unwavering dedication to the mission.""

During the Singapore Airshow four major aviation names signed the Global Sustainable Aviation Fuel Declaration. Airbus Rolls Royce Safran and Singapore Airlines endorsed the objective of rapidly increasing SAF production and use. The declaration is open for every airline and aerospace stakeholder to join, helping the sector align with Paris Agreement climate targets.

Why SAF truly matters

SAF can lower life cycle carbon emissions by up to eighty percent compared with traditional jet fuel. Because most existing aircraft can already operate with a fifty percent SAF blend, the solution delivers immediate impact without waiting for new airframes or engines. Airbus has pledged to certify its entire fleet for one hundred percent SAF by 2030, demonstrating that technical barriers are minimal and focus can shift to supply growth.

Collaboration unlocks scale

A notable feature of the declaration is its value chain approach. Manufacturers fuel producers airlines and policymakers are invited to coordinate investment calendars and policy frameworks so that refineries distribution networks and airport infrastructure expand together. This reduces risk for each participant, encouraging faster capital deployment.

Non-obvious insight

Airline demand signals alone are not enough; engine makers and airframers publicly backing SAF give financial institutions clear evidence that the technology will remain compatible with future aircraft architectures. As a result, long term fuel purchase agreements may secure lower interest rates, accelerating construction of first of a kind bio refineries.

What happens next

Signatories intend to publish transparent progress data annually. Singapore Airlines has indicated that early demonstration flights departing Changi Airport will feature higher blend levels, offering practical learning for regulators across the Asia Pacific region.

Conclusion

The Global SAF Declaration transforms isolated sustainability pledges into a united implementation roadmap, making commercial scale green aviation fuel a realistic near term prospect rather than a distant aspiration.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-9.svg,N,,2025-11-26 08:57:44.786246

Perhaps the most optimistic words are that “technology is advancing faster than regulation can catch up”.","November certainly provided rich pickings for those in the maritime news business, with plenty of stories which will have long term implications for the shipping industry. The commencement of exports from the Simandou iron ore project is a potential game changer for the capesize market, whilst the cessation of Houthi attacks saw an upturn in Suez traffic, although a resumption of Somali pirate activity will see shipping kept on its toes in the Horn of Africa region. No month could pass without US politics filling the news agenda and this proved to be the case with the on/off argument over port fees taxing the mind of anyone involved in the transpacific trades. In amongst all this was the continued fallout from the previous month’s MEPC meeting whilst the COP 30 meeting in Brazil provided further depressing news for those hoping to see progress on climate action.

Ten years on from the Paris Accord, it really does look like the ‘Axis of Obstruction’ comprising those countries reluctant to quit fossil fuels is set to derail all the progress and the billions of dollars spent on addressing the climate change issue. On the eve of the COP 30 meeting, the International Energy Agency released a report advising that oil and gas demand will continue to rise for the next 25 years under a scenario “which reflects governments’ fading commitment to climate change” and further commented that it is now “all but certain that 1.5 degrees of warming will be exceeded within a decade or less and that the pathways that limit this overshoot to low levels are out of reach.’’

That crucial element which feeds the addiction to fossil fuels, the tanker market, is ending the year on a buoyant note. Newbuilding orders are being placed at a much accelerated rate. In many cases buyers are opting for the most efficient conventional propulsion systems rather than the more exotic options which have been touted over the past few years. Is the shipping industry, which has made huge strides in so many areas with energy saving devices and better voyage management, also now experiencing its own fading commitment to climate change?

There was plenty of optimism at the recent Bahri Week gathering of the tanker industry in Dubai. Despite actual fixtures during the event being a bit slower, with one broker report commenting that the mood was more “canapes than cargoes”, there were plenty of closed door discussions as owners and charterers jockeyed to position themselves in an ever changing geopolitical and regulatory environment.

As the tanker industry left Dubai, the next big event in the Middle East was the Dubai Airshow where an industry which is also grappling with it’s low carbon future put its wares on display, but again the main action was in discussions behind closed doors. In a preview of the airshow, the Monocle Minute described the aviation industry as “at a moment of flux in which technology is advancing faster than regulation can catch up” and further commented “the industry finally appears to be moving beyond platitudes and towards climate action instead…..still, the broader sector is in a bind: sustainable aviation fuel production is nowhere near scale. The airshow will present glimpses of a greener future but also lay bare just how far from that horizon the commercial fleet remains.”

All sounds familiar to our own industry? Perhaps the most optimistic words are that “technology is advancing faster than regulation can catch up”. Shipping is a much more fragmented sector than aviation, but if we can continue down a path where technology brings about the advances the regulators have failed to agree on but still provides material commercial savings to the participants, perhaps those green targets will become a little closer.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Maersk-Air-Cargo.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 06:56:11.395995

For the U.S. producer looking at the 2025-26 crop after USDA’s WASDE reports resumed, the outlook for soybeans and corn in South America still appears “comfortable” in the official numbers, but once you dig into weather, costs and domestic demand, the safety margin looks much thinner than the headlines suggest.

In Brazil, soybean numbers keep climbing. CONAB’s second crop survey projects a record area of about 49 million hectares (+3.6% from the previous crop), with production estimated at 177.6016 million tons in 2025-26, slightly below the 171.4817 million tons of the 2024-25 cycle. USDA’s November WASDE, in turn, works with a Brazilian crop of 175 million tons, domestic use close to 63.3 million and exports around 112.5 million, cementing the country’s role as the world’s main supplier. These figures rest on still-reasonable conditions in Brazil’s Central-West, but behind them sits a more complex weather mosaic: climate reports point to a La Niña influence from late 2025 onward, with a tendency toward above-normal rainfall in parts of the Central-West and North, but a risk of irregular or below-normal volumes in southern Brazil and parts of Argentina and Paraguay, along with temperatures consistently above historical averages. That raises the odds of localized pockets of crop disappointment, especially in Rio Grande do Sul, Paraguay and northern Argentina, even if the national picture still looks comfortable.

In Mato Grosso, the main producing state, market reports show a soybean crop essentially fully planted (about 96.36% of area seeded, according to IMEA on Nov. 17, 2025), with good stand establishment in most regions. However, there are reports of spot replanting because of heavy rains or brief dry spells that created localized stress. The fast-planting pace supports expectations of more than 48-49 million tons of soybeans in the state, according to regional estimates, in line with CONAB’s view of a record national crop. At the same time, total production costs in Mato Grosso remain high: official cost-of-production estimates point to total outlays around R$8,000 per hectare (about US$1,506 per hectare at the Nov. 17, 2025, exchange rate) for the 2026-27 crop, with some relief on inputs such as seed and fertilizer, but higher operating and financial costs that keep margins tight at current price levels. That squeeze explains the defensive stance among many growers, who forward-sold a large portion of last season’s crop but are more cautious with 2025-26 sales, waiting for better windows in Chicago and in the foreign exchange market.

On the demand side, Brazil combines aggressive soybean exports in grain form — more than 100 million tons shipped between January and October 2025, with China accounting for more than 90% of monthly volumes at times — with growing domestic use. Meal demand remains strong, supported by record beef slaughter, rising hog and poultry slaughter and higher milk production, according to IBGE, which translates into solid feed demand across feedlots, hog and poultry operations, and dairy cooperatives nationwide. At the same time, a new biofuels policy is reinforcing demand for soybean oil: Brazil’s National Energy Policy Council raised the mandatory biodiesel blend in diesel from B14 to B15 as of Aug. 1, 2025, pushing projected biodiesel consumption to about 9.8 million cubic meters (+8-9% from 2024) and soybean-oil use to nearly 8 million tons. In parallel, the ethanol blend in gasoline was increased from 27% to 30% as part of an official strategy to reduce dependence on imported gasoline. In practice, this means a growing share of Brazil’s soybean crop is being locked in domestically through biodiesel and, increasingly, through renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, while meal and whole beans continue to anchor exports.

For corn, Brazil’s picture is one of high output but a much tighter balance once supply and demand are combined. CONAB’s second survey points to total production of about 141 million tons in 2024-25, with a small downward adjustment to about 138.8 million tons in 2025-26, despite increased area in both first and second crops. The decline comes mainly from more modest yield expectations after recent records. USDA’s November WASDE, however, projects 136 million tons for 2024-25 and 131 million for 2025-26 — in other words, a more cautious view of Brazil’s production potential. In both readings, the core point is the same: domestic use is growing rapidly. CONAB pegs Brazilian corn consumption at about 90.6 million tons in 2024-25, more than 7% growth year over year, with an additional 4-5% increase expected in 2025-26, driven by feed demand and, above all, the corn-ethanol boom. Official and industry reports indicate that ethanol from corn already accounts for roughly 20-25% of Brazil’s total ethanol output, having reached a bit over 8 billion liters in the Center-South in 2024-25, with strong expansion projected over the next decade as mandated ethanol blends rise and new plants come online.

This structural growth in domestic corn demand helps explain why, even with robust exports, Brazil’s balance sheet is not as loose as headline volume suggests. Trade data show shipments near 6.5 million tons in October and more than 23 million accumulated between July and October 2025, but projections for the 2024-25 cycle call for exports of around 40 million tons — and somewhat above that in 2025-26 — against a backdrop of rising internal consumption. At the ports, this translates into tighter basis: export-parity prices in the Central-West often run several reais below domestic cash prices, indicating that the internal market — especially corn-ethanol plants and feed mills — has become the main sponge for supply. In Mato Grosso, the state ag economics institute reports cash corn prices around R$46-47 per 60-kilogram sack in November, with B3 futures trading higher and export parity in the R$37-40 per-sack range, underscoring that domestic demand is supporting the market.

In Argentina, the picture is one of recovery with meaningful risks. After severe crop failures in 2022-23 and a still-uneven 2024-25 season, the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange and other local agencies project a total grain harvest of roughly 142-143 million tons in 2025-26, led by corn (about 58 million tons, +18% from the previous crop), while soybeans are expected to come in around 48-49 million tons, slightly below the prior season, mainly because of an estimated 4.3% reduction in area (totaling about 17.6 million hectares). In its most recent updates, the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange highlights delayed soybean planting: only about 13% of the area was sown by mid-November, compared with more than 20% at the same time last year, because of excess rainfall in parts of the core region and delays in Buenos Aires province. Initial production potential for soy sits near 47 million tons, but with significant uncertainty, as excessive moisture coexists with pockets of moisture deficit and heat in other areas. For corn, the situation is almost the mirror image: the same exchange reports planting progress around 36-37% of area, above last year, with good conditions in the fields already established, supporting projections for a strong crop. Overall, Argentina is reemerging as a relevant competitor in corn and soybean products (meal and oil), but the combination of La Niña, waterlogged soils in parts of the region and a recent history of sharp crop losses keeps weather risk above normal until the season is fully made.

Paraguay, meanwhile, is emerging as a quiet pivot in South American soy. International official reports project Paraguayan production at around 10.9 million tons in 2025-26, recovering from last season’s losses because of more favorable weather and modest gains in area and yield. Most of that volume still goes to export, either as whole beans or via crushing in plants in Paraguay itself, Brazil and Argentina. The country, however, faces structural challenges: rising costs, limited infrastructure, heavy reliance on river transport for exports and the need to adapt to regulations such as European Union deforestation rules, which could reshape regional soybean trade flows. Even so, a full Paraguayan crop adds seasonal downward pressure in a market already dependent on the Brazil-Argentina axis, reinforcing the idea that any supply shock in one of these players can be partially offset by the others.

From an international price standpoint, the recent environment has been one of explosive moves in Chicago. Soybean rallies — triggered by Chinese buying headlines, South American crop adjustments or technical buying — have at times pulled corn and wheat higher as well. Still, the November WASDE again cooled the bullish momentum by maintaining a view of reasonably comfortable global stocks. At the same time, South America keeps gaining share in global soybean trade — recent analysis shows the region consolidating control over the bulk of world exports — while China continues to diversify origins but remains heavily dependent on Brazil, Argentina and, to a lesser extent, Paraguay. In Brazil, domestic soybean cash prices in many regions are below what growers consider attractive relative to full production costs, which explains the slower pace of forward selling for the new crop, despite record shipments of the old one. The Brazilian real, which has strengthened since the start of the year, is also eroding export premiums in local currency, making FOB opportunities less compelling at the farm gate.

It is also important to remember that in China, the world’s largest soybean importer, port soybean stocks have clearly been rising year over year. At the end of October, stocks climbed from about 5 million tons in 2023 to about 8 million in 2024 and about 10 million tons in 2025. By mid-November, volumes rose from about 6 million tons in 2023 to about 7 million in 2024, reaching just over 10.3 million tons in 2025. This shows that Chinese ports are operating with record inventory levels for this time of year.

Finally, there is a policy and data component that cannot be ignored. In the United States, the end of the latest budget standoff only secured federal funding through early 2026, and there are indications that a full normalization of USDA’s publication calendar could face delays, precisely when the market needs reliable data to guide decisions. At the same time, Washington is debating tariff reductions on goods not produced domestically, such as coffee, signaling that trade and fiscal policy can quickly redraw the map of agricultural flows — a useful reminder for soybeans and corn, even if they are not at the center of these measures for now.

Qantas’ Vanessa Hudson, CBA CEO Matt Comyn and Origin chief executive Frank Calabria said it was important that business and government collaborated to create demand signals that would encourage markets to bring more sustainable options to customers.

“You need both supply and demand signals,” Qantas CEO Hudson said.

Fuelling more sustainable industries

There were major opportunities on offer for the nation in areas like sustainable aviation fuels, Hudson said. Long-haul commercial flights powered by anything other than liquid fuels were unlikely within our lifetimes, making alternative fuels vital in making flying sustainable.

“It takes a coalition of people and organisations to get that going,” she said. “The opportunity that we see is Australia has some of the largest sources of the feedstock for sustainable aviation in the world.”

That feedstock was currently being exported to Asia and then brought back to Australia as fuel, she said. “So this is an opportunity for us to potentially take a lead.”

Qantas was working with Queensland group Jet Zero to convert sugarcane waste to ethanol that could then be used to make sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, she said. It was also working with partners like Ampol to convert old fossil fuel infrastructure to support sustainable fuels.

“Aviation is an incredibly hard to abate industry, but that doesn't stop us being ambitious”.

Costs key for customers

Origin CEO Calabria said with substantial new infrastructure build required to support the transition, investing signals needed to be strong. The infrastructure build-out had the potential to be a game changer for national productivity, Calabria said, creating thousands of jobs.

Calabria said he preferred the term “energy expansion” to “energy transition” Rooftop solar had offset most new demand over the last decade, but data centres, EVs, and home electrification were changing the picture again, he said.

Managing energy was “no longer just buy commodity and manage risk”, he said. For example, there was now an enormous amount of “behind the meter” generation and storage happening on customer premises, he said.

While regulator focus was switching to security of supply, customers had costs at front of mind, he said. Attitudes to the transition also varied widely across the country “Regional people are feeling left behind,” he said.

CBA CEO Comyn echoed that sentiment, saying a conversation with customers in regional Queensland could be quite different to one with customers in metropolitan Melbourne when it came to sustainability.

CBA customers were also concerned with costs, Comyn said. “Cost pressures are coming through very strongly, much more than four or five years ago.”

Working together

Not everyone has the resources of big businesses to answer energy transition challenges, and businesses would need support Comyn said, saying CBA had provided $64.4bn in funding to businesses to help support sustainability initiatives since 2020.

But the CEOs agreed that the journey to sustainability carried challenges and costs.

“If Australia can get this right it puts us in a very strong position, but it’s challenging,” Comyn said. “We have to be engaging in the community and talking about the hard things.”

CBA’s role was to support and educate customers as well as finance them, he said. The bank is bringing a new electricity hedging product to market to help ease pressures in areas like pricing and reliability, Comyn said.

Fast follower

While all three CEOs agreed the sustainability transition was an economic opportunity for Australia, Hudson said we didn’t always need to be at the bleeding edge of that transition to be well positioned.

“Being a fast follower is a positive thing for Australia” she said, saying it provided the opportunity to look at what’s being done in other countries and make more informed decisions about our own path.

Qantas currently gets 70 per cent of its sustainable aviation fuel - which can cost up to three times as much as conventional fuel - from the US and particularly California, where demand was being encouraged and prices were starting to become comparable to fossil-based fuels, she said.

In contrast, Europe was leaning more towards a penalty-based system that discourages fossil fuel usage. Hudson said she found the US approach more appealing, but there were lessons Australia could learn from both sides of the Atlantic to encourage groups like Jet Zero to boost our own sustainability and security of supply.

Generation, a sustainable investment management firm, has published its 2025 Sustainability Trends Report examining the year's key developments in climate technology and policy.

The analysis highlights a divergence between political direction in some major economies and the continued expansion of renewable energy infrastructure and electric vehicle production.

Trade implications of policy shifts

The report documents changes in US federal climate policy under the Trump administration, including withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and steps to limit regulatory authority over greenhouse gas emissions.

According to Generation, these policy reversals have been linked to cancellations of nearly US$30bn in planned clean-industry investment in the US, with modelling suggesting potential investment losses could reach US$500bn over a decade.

This change appears to be creating opportunities for other manufacturing centres. China's industrial policy has positioned the country as a major exporter of renewable energy technology and electric vehicles, with the report noting that EVs already represent close to 60% of new car sales in China, compared to about 10% in the US in 2024.

The report describes China as a future ""electrostate"", with emissions potentially peaking well before the country's official 2030 target.

Supply chain developments in energy infrastructure

Global electricity generation from solar rose 28.3% last year, according to the report's analysis.

China added more solar capacity to its grid in a single month than any other country has built in an entire year, indicating the scale of manufacturing and installation supply chains now operational in that market.

Battery deployment is also affecting grid operations in some regions. In California, batteries meet about 20% of peak evening demand on some days, rising to about 30% in parts of Australia, displacing gas-fired generation during certain hours.

However, demand growth is complicating the picture.

EVs, heat pumps, data centres and air conditioning systems are pushing power demand growth towards 4% annually, almost double the long-term average. This has allowed fossil-fuel generation to rise, with coal's absolute usage remaining close to record highs, sustained by consumption in China and India even as these countries deploy new renewable capacity.

Transport sector and manufacturing competition

The International Energy Agency data cited in the report suggests electric cars are expected to account for 25% of global auto sales this year. Vehicles with plugs already constitute over half of new sales in China and about a quarter across Europe, indicating different rates of market penetration across major economies.

The US market shows a different pattern, with EVs making up only about 10% of sales in 2024. A modest increase is expected in 2025 as buyers move to access expiring subsidies before federal support programmes are potentially altered.

Tesla's market position has changed this year, particularly in Europe where the company has experienced double-digit sales declines in several markets. Chinese brands now offer models at lower price points, creating new competitive dynamics.

Electric lorry sales are rising from a small base, though infrastructure for high-power charging necessary for heavy goods vehicles remains at an early stage in most countries. Aviation and shipping remain further from decarbonisation targets, despite Europe's mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, which face financing challenges.

Negotiations for sustainable shipping legislation at the International Maritime Organization were adjourned this autumn, with the report noting that lobbyists from the US and Saudi Arabia played a role in the outcome.

Industrial supply chains and hydrogen projects

The report's analysis of hydrogen projects suggests a significant reassessment is underway.

A substantial portion of European projects have been cancelled and many more shelved as the cost gap with grey hydrogen remains wide.

The authors note that ""enthusiasm for hydrogen may have cost us years in which industrial decarbonisation could have been pursued by more practical means"", observing that early promotion came partly from oil majors.

Benchmark data indicates clean energy is attracting about twice as much investment globally as fossil fuels, with solar costs declining year-on-year since 2009, while gas-fired power costs have remained relatively stable.

Fuels are the lifeblood of military operations. The resilience of fuel supply chains often determines who can move faster and more efficiently, fight longer and, ultimately, win the battle. Due to the renewed security risks on NATO’s Eastern Flank, there is a push to revitalise European fuel supply chains as essential ingredients for operational readiness.

It is essential to understand early on how the energy transition can be leveraged to enhance military effectiveness, considering the need for European Allies to revitalise fuel readiness while civilian decarbonization is reshaping the conditions of military operations. This report analyses challenges and opportunities of adopting alternative sustainable fuels across the air, land and maritime domains as of 2025.

The interdependence of civilian and military fuel infrastructure means that the energy transition will undoubtedly impact military fuel readiness. For this reason, this report identified and assessed challenges and opportunities of the civilian energy transition for military fuel readiness across the air, land and maritime domains as of 2025. Based on the analysis, the following five conclusions emerge:

The most important feature of a military fuel is its alignment with military performance requirements.

Changes in civilian fossil fuel availability and logistics infrastructure necessitate a reassessment of military fuel readiness.

The gradual adoption of domestically produced drop-in fuels can reduce dependence on oil imports, thereby enhancing supply chain resilience.

While it is in both the civilian and military sectors’ a near-term interest to increase adoption of drop-in fuels, the scale of this industry has not yet kicked-in.

Other alternative fuels such as synthetic and bio-based methanol and ammonia are not fit for military use.

Since completing Bangkok’s debut flight in November 2024 and launching the AAM Sandbox Initiative with continuous trial operations in October 2025, EHang has consistently advance the initiative with “safety first” approach.","EHang Holdings Limited (Nasdaq: EH) (""EHang"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in advanced air mobility (“AAM”) technology, today announced the successful launch of an urban human-carrying flight event in Bangkok with the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) and local partners, under the AAM Sandbox Initiative. Air Chief Marshal Manat Chavanaprayoon, Director General of CAAT, personally boarded and experienced the experimental flight, becoming the world’s first civil aviation authority chief globally to ride the pilotless EH216-S on an urban flight. This marks another milestone in EHang’s global AAM commercialization layout.

On November 24, EHang officially initiated the urban human-carrying flight event under the AAM Sandbox Initiative at the headquarters of Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), a Bangkok landmark located in the city’s central business district. The event received strong supports from senior Thai government officials, with distinguished attendees including Air Chief Marshal Manat Chavanaprayoon, Han Kok Juan, Director General of Singapore’s Civil Aviation Authority, Dr. Arak Sutivong, Deputy CEO of SCB X Public Company Limited, together with nearly 100 Thai business leaders and media representatives. Under widespread attention, the EH216-S completed a series of takeoffs and landings, as well as route flights. Air Chief Marshal Manat Chavanaprayoon and Dr. Arak Sutivong then boarded the EH216-S to experience a pilotless urban flight. The aircraft flew smoothly in the Bangkok’s core business district, with the Director General waving to audience, drawing extended applause.

These flights mark significant progress for the Thailand’s AAM Sandbox Initiative toward commercial operation and lay a solid foundation for EHang to deepen its presence in the Thai market and launch future commercial services. It also sets a benchmark for the path to commercialization of the AAM industry in Southeast Asia.

Under the support and oversight of the CAAT, the EHang work team, led by Senior Vice President Hu Longxuan, who oversees commercial operations department, dedicated full efforts to ensure the complete success of this flight event. This marked the first time EHang conducted overseas on-site demonstrations and validation of the EH216-S's comprehensive emergency scenario safety capabilities. During this collaboration, EHang and CAAT’s UAM team held in-depth discussions on four core pillars: flight safety, product technology, after-sales maintenance, and operating systems. Together they validated the EH216-S’s safety and commercial feasibility through nine extreme scenario tests and four dedicated technical exchanges. CAAT’s team expressed high recognition for EHang’s systematic support capabilities, including continuous airworthiness, full-lifecycle technical support, spare parts supply, professional talent training, and rapid maintenance support.

This overseas on-site demonstration and verification validated the EH216-S’s reliable performance under extreme conditions and its commercial operational readiness, highlighting EHang’s leadership in autonomous flying technology and end-to-end service capabilities. It establishes a solid technical foundation and regulatory trust, paving the way for the EH216-S to launch regular commercial operations under the Thailand’s AAM Sandbox Initiative.

As the world’s first pilotless human-carrying eVTOL company to obtain the Type Certificate, Production Certificate, and Standard Airworthiness Certificate from China’s Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC), EHang has identified Thailand as one of its core overseas strategic markets. Since completing Bangkok’s debut flight in November 2024 and launching the AAM Sandbox Initiative with continuous trial operations in October 2025, EHang has consistently advance the initiative with “safety first” approach. As a key achievement of Thailand’s Sandbox Initiative, the EH216-S not only maintained stable performance in point-to-point pilotless flight but also demonstrated strong adaptability to Bangkok’s traffic congestion and tourism scenarios across typical urban environments. According to plans, EHang will collaborate with local partners to gradually expand the sandbox area to popular destinations such as Pattaya, Phuket, and Koh Samui, building a diversified low-altitude route network covering urban commuting and aerial tourism.

Air Chief Marshal Manat Chavanaprayoon, Director General of CAAT, stated: “The advanced technology and autonomous safety performance demonstrated by the EH216-S are impressive. This flight demonstration represents not only a significant milestone in the development of AAM technologies which is expected to transform future air transportation systems, but forms part of Thailand’s ongoing efforts to become an Aviation Hub in the region. CAAT is committed to serving both as a regulator and a facilitator to ensure that modern aviation technologies can be safely and effectively implemented. We look forward to seeing Thailand achieve a breakthrough in establishing air routes connecting airports and urban areas. With the 2026 Advanced Air Mobility Symposium organized by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to be held in Thailand, we expect the country to become a global model for commercialization and large-scale development of AAM in 2026.

Luong Pham of Aerial Sea venture, supporting organization for the event, commented: “The EH216-S’s successful flight at core Bangkok landmarks such as the royal-owned SCB headquarters, coupled with the CAAT Director General’s personal participation, not only represents authoritative recognition of cutting-edge autonomous technology but also highlights Thailand’s strategic vision and commitment to embracing transportation innovation and developing its AAM ecosystem.”

Conor Yang, Chief Financial Officer of EHang, emphasized: “This event represents a key practical achievement of EHang’s overseas strategy. By continuously advancing human-carrying flights under the Sandbox Initiative in core urban scenarios such as Bangkok, EHang will further assist the Thai government and CAAT in improving Thailand’s AAM operation and regulatory framework.With the support of the CAAT, Thailand is highly likely to achieve the world’s first commercial eVTOL operations using an innovative regulatory approach of “sandbox”, creating a demonstration model for Southeast Asia and the world. EHang will continue to provide advanced integrated air mobility solutions to benefit more countries across the globe.”",https://www.asdnews.com/NewsImages/b/94859/102721_O.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 06:56:42.140746

Riyadh Air has a larger order for the Dreamliner at 39 firm commitments and 33 options.","Saudi Arabia's second flag carrier made headlines last month when it embarked on its first flight. A 787 took off from Riyadh, touching down at London Heathrow at sunrise. With funding secured, the carrier is now looking at global expansion, hoping to cover 100 destinations by 2030. Part of this expansion will come from the carrier's order for Airbus A350-1000 widebody jets, set to be powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines.

The order, made at Paris Air Show, includes an even split of firm commitments and options, and it will be fascinating to see how many of these options are taken over the next several years. In this article, learn more about the order and what it will mean for Riyadh Air, Airbus and Rolls-Royce. We then cover where they might fly and more on the carrier's first flights, making use of a second-hand 787 Dreamliner.

What Aircraft Are In The Order?

In June 2025, Riyadh Air put in an order for 50 Airbus A350-1000 widebody aircraft at the Paris Air Show. It was completed at a signing ceremony at Paris Le Bourget today, by Riyadh Air Chief Financial Officer Adam Boukadida and Airbus EVP Sales of Commercial Aircraft Business, Benoît de Saint-Exupéry. Also present was PIF Governor and Riyadh Air Chairman His Excellency Yasir Al-Rumayyan, CEO of Riyadh Air Tony Douglas and CEO of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, Christian Scherer.

It entails 25 firm commitments and 25 options, which would bring the new Saudi Arabian carrier's fleet up to 182 aircraft, should all the options be filled. Tony Douglas, the carrier's CEO, said: ""Riyadh Air is making significant progress as we move towards our first flight later this year and agreeing this deal for up to 50 Airbus A350-1000 aircraft is an important statement of intent.""

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus EVP Sales of the Commercial Aircraft business, was also optimistic about how the order could help Riyadh Air's development and build a partnership between the carrier and Airbus. He said: ""We are proud to extend our strategic partnership with Riyadh Air as it continues to build a pioneering carrier for the Kingdom. As the long-range leader, the A350-1000 will provide unrivalled efficiency, range and passenger comfort, making it the ideal choice to support the airline’s ambitious growth plans.""

The order also connects Riyadh Air to Sustainable Aviation Fuel, as the A350-1000, like all modern Airbus jets, can operate with a 50% SAF blend. This would seem to be a contradiction to Saudi Arabia's oil-based economy, which produced 12.4 million barrels of oil per day in 2024. It will be interesting to see if the carrier uses its new jets SAF capabilities or sticks with locally sourced oil-based aviation fuel.

The Jets Will Be Rolls-Royce Powered

The order from Riyadh Air is also a boost for Rolls-Royce as the jets will be powered by Trent XWB-97 engines. The British manufacturer, therefore, adds at least 50 engines to its order sheet, raising it to 100 if the options become commitments. Rob Watson, President, Civil Aerospace, Rolls-Royce, said:

""We’re looking forward to supporting the significant growth ambitions of Riyadh Air in its launch year. The Trent XWB-97 is an incredible engine and our TotalCare package will provide operational certainty across the fleet. The engine will benefit from the £1bn investment we’re making to the Trent engine family that improves their durability and efficiency across all operations. We look forward to supporting these new aircraft as they enter service.”

The table below includes specifications for the Trent XWB-97 engine according to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) type-certificate data sheet:

The agreement goes beyond simply providing the Trent XWB engines. Rolls-Royce and the airline have also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that commits the manufacturer to provide its comprehensive TotalCare service to keep the engines in working order.

What Is Riyadh Air?

Riyadh Air is a new Saudi Arabian flag carrier founded by Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The carrier's hub is at King Khalid International Airport, and it aims to find its place on the global market. The fleet consists of Airbus A321neo narrowbody aircraft, and Airbus A350-100 and Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner widebody aircraft. As with many Saudi infrastructure projects, the carrier is owned by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF). At the carrier's head is CEO Tony Douglas, who was previously CEO of Etihad Airways from 2018 to 2022.

It has ties to both SkyTeam and Star Alliance through a host of cooperation agreements, including with China Eastern Airlines, Saudi, Virgin Atlantic, Turkish Airlines and Singapore Airlines. Its current non-Saudi destination is London Heathrow. His Excellency Yasir Al-Rumayyan, PIF Governor and Chairman of Riyadh Air, described the importance of the carrier to the Saudi economy: ""Our new national carrier is set to take to the skies in the near future, and as a fundamental element of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s infrastructure, will connect our capital city to over 100 international destinations around the globe by 2030.""

Riyadh Air could form a significant part of the Middle Eastern nation's non-oil economy, which it will surely have to transition towards amid climate change and the inevitable exhaustion of reserves. It is predicted that the carrier will eventually add $20 billion to the nation's GDP and provide 200,000 direct and indirect jobs.

Where Will Riyadh Air's A350s Fly?

There have been no significant announcements of specific A350-1000 routes for Saudi Arabia's new flag carrier. However, we can assume, due to the aircraft's range and capacity, that the jet will fly to destinations in Asia and Europe. The carrier's first flights are planned to fly from Riyadh to European cities like London. They will then fly back to an alternative Saudi destination. An example could be Riyadh, as the A350 will then return to Riyadh to restart the cycle.

The clear limitation of Riyadh Air's network will be its fleet size while it waits for deliveries to be fulfilled. There have been no announcements of when the A350s will start to arrive, but we can assume they won't come for a few years. By this time, the network should be well established.

Riyadh Air expects to receive a new aircraft every month, which it will use to serve two new destinations each month. By 2030, the carrier expects to serve the major capital cities in Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East. While the network grows, its host of strategic partnerships, including code-sharing agreements, will facilitate further expansion.

Riyadh Air Takes To The Skies

Following delays in the carrier's 787 deliveries, which pushed the first flight back, Riyadh Air has now taken to the skies. In October 2026, it flew its new Boeing 787 Dreamliner, taking off from Riyadh at 3.26 am, and touching down at London Heathrow at 7.14 am. The flight made use of HZ-RXX, named Jamila, which was the carrier's only aircraft. The jet had previously been owned by Oman Air. This flight opened up the route to London Heathrow and it was not bookable by the public.

Instead, it carried an unknown number of the carrier and PIF's employees. These early flights aren't about making money, but about securing and maintaining competitive slots at London Heathrow. Tony Douglas, Riyadh's CEO, explained the reasoning for such a limited launch: ""If you go big bang on day one and assume everything will work perfectly on the first day, well, the reality is it won't. So we will use that short period to trial everything and make sure the feedback gives us the opportunity to polish every last little detail before I actually sell a ticket to you.""

The route to London Heathrow is set to become one of Riyadh Air's most frequent and important routes. Once its 787s start arriving, four by the end of 2025, the carrier should operate the route daily. This may increase further once the A350s start to arrive, although that will be dependent on the carrier securing additional slots.

It is unsurprising that the 787, rather than the A350, flew the carrier's first route. Riyadh Air has a larger order for the Dreamliner at 39 firm commitments and 33 options. More Boeing 787s should arrive soon, as its first purpose-built custom 787 rolled out of the paint shop in September and a second was finished soon after.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/latest.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-26 06:56:53.662175

“Tailings reprocessing offers genuine benefits, reducing pressure for new mining [and] addressing existing environmental liabilities,” said Mathikoza Dube, an expert on critical minerals based in Rustenburg.
New technology boosts metal recovery in waste New reprocessing technology has made it economically viable to extract platinum group metals from tailings, and several operations are already underway in South Africa’s platinum mining belt, around the city of Rustenburg.
“Reprocessing tailings does not erase the damage that created them.
My husband died of lung disease at 54.” Like many of her neighbours, she says any new cycle of mining activity – this time in the name of the clean energy transition – must not repeat the past.","Besides the dust that cloaks pathways, windowsills and gardens, the towering grey heaps of discarded rock are another unwelcome reminder of the platinum mine next door to the South African township of Chaneng.

In and around the city of Rustenburg, the low-grade platinum ore that has made South Africa the world’s top producer of the silvery metal creates massive waste piled in large rocky heaps known as tailings. For every tonne of metal extracted, hundreds of tonnes of waste rock is left behind in huge piles.

The transition to cleaner energy system is expected to push up global demand for platinum group metals (PGM) – which include palladium and other precious metals, as well as platinum. They are used in hydrogen-related technologies such as fuel cells and electrolysers that split water molecules as well as in hybrid cars that need catalytic converters to curb pollution.

To secure supplies, mining companies are starting to make use of what was once considered waste.

Reprocessing mine tailings using new technology can be a more sustainable form of producing minerals and metals needed for the energy transition because it is expected to reduce the size of existing waste heaps and boost output without the need to open new mines, which can cause more environmental destruction and community displacement.

“Tailings reprocessing offers genuine benefits, reducing pressure for new mining [and] addressing existing environmental liabilities,” said Mathikoza Dube, an expert on critical minerals based in Rustenburg.

“It offers the world a pathway to secure supplies of energy transition minerals while remediating waste that’s contaminated communities for generations,” Dube added, cautioning it is not a “magic solution” and should be approached in a way that ensures local communities benefit.

In Chaneng, where the tailings dumps loom over backyards, residents are wary.

“Same theft in new clothes”

They fear the plan to reprocess mining tailings at the neighbouring mine – operated by South African platinum miner Sibanye-Stillwater – is being dressed up as sustainable when in reality it will mean more contamination, blasting, dust and no end to their community’s problems.

Despite decades of mining, unemployment in the area remains high, many people say they never received compensation for the loss of their agricultural land and most households still lack access to basic sanitation infrastructure.

Water testing carried out by SRK Consulting in 2009 found elevated nitrate levels exceeding World Health Organization guidelines in community boreholes, and health practitioners document dramatic increases in respiratory diseases.

“Now they want to dig up the waste piles and call it progress? Show us the ownership papers. Show us the rehabilitation plan. Otherwise, it’s the same theft in new clothes,” said Johannes Kgomo, a community leader.

South Africa’s mining legislation requires that 26% of mining assets are held by historically disadvantaged people including Black South Africans, and Chaneng residents are demanding a stake of 15% to 30% in any tailings operation on their land, allowing them to have a say in how the business is run.

They say that should be granted to them as compensation for the health and environmental problems they have endured as a result of the mine.

The community is also demanding comprehensive water testing and treatment, adequately resourced clinics with respiratory specialists, compensation for destroyed agricultural land, infrastructure repair and long-term health monitoring.

“We are not asking for handouts,” said Gideon Chitanga of the National Union of Mineworkers, which often takes the side of local communities in disputes with companies.

“These people have already paid with their health, their water, their land. That contamination, that suffering – that is their investment. Now they want returns and decision-making power,” Chitanga added.

A spokesperson for Sibanye-Stillwater declined to comment.

A mining industry source, who asked not to be identified, said conversations with community members were ongoing.

“Nobody disputes these communities have suffered. The question is how to structure ownership in a way that’s legally sound, financially viable, and genuinely empowering,” the source said.

New technology boosts metal recovery in waste

New reprocessing technology has made it economically viable to extract platinum group metals from tailings, and several operations are already underway in South Africa’s platinum mining belt, around the city of Rustenburg.

Sibanye-Stillwater already operates multiple retreatment facilities, processing thousands of tonnes of waste ore monthly.

Another South African miner Tharisa processes chromite from PGM tailings commercially. Chromite is used to obtain chromium, a metal used in the manufacture of wind turbines and some energy storage batteries.

“Historical tailings facilities contain economically viable concentrations that were unrecoverable with older technology,” said Leo Vonopartis from the University of the Witwatersrand’s BUGEMET research programme, which studies the geology of South Africa’s Bushveld Complex mining belt.

Tailings in the area around Rustenburg can contain up to 2.5 grammes per tonne of combined platinum, palladium and rhodium – along with chromite. Vanadium, cobalt and rare earth elements have also been found.

At current prices, which have rallied this year, it is worth extracting the rare metals, despite the challenges.

Breaking with the cycle of extraction and injustice

“The technology exists. The economics work. The question is whether we can structure these projects to genuinely benefit the people who have paid mining’s costs,” a spokesperson for one mining company said, asking not to be named.

Without that, local expert Dube said, the reprocessing of tailings is scarcely better than other forms of mining.

“Reprocessing tailings does not erase the damage that created them. If it is structured as extraction by another name – where companies profit and communities remain marginalised – we have just found a new way to perpetuate old injustices.”

Australia’s COP31 Co-President vows to fight alongside Pacific for a fossil fuel transition

Gesturing toward the tailings dam visible from her yard, Noxolo Mthembu recalls the days when her vegetable patch used to feed the family.

“We used to grow spinach, tomatoes, pumpkins,” she told Climate Home News. “Now nothing grows. The dust kills everything. My children have asthma. My husband died of lung disease at 54.”

Like many of her neighbours, she says any new cycle of mining activity – this time in the name of the clean energy transition – must not repeat the past.

“Show me the ownership papers with our names. Show me the water treatment plant. Show me the clinic with enough staff. Then I will believe this time is different.”",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/11/IMG_2687-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-26 06:57:19.832234

The Government’s position is clear: expansion at Heathrow must be cost-effective, minimising the burden on passengers and coming at no cost to the taxpayer.
We know we must provide as much clarity and certainty for communities affected by expansion at Heathrow, as soon as possible.
Airports National Policy Statement Review The airports national policy statement provides the policy framework for the Government’s approach to securing additional airport capacity in the south-east of England.
We have begun detailed analytical and policy work to this effect.","Further to my oral statement to the House on 22 October, I am writing to update the House on the Government’s decision to identify the scheme promoted by Heathrow Airport Ltd as the scheme to take forward in informing the ongoing review of the airports national policy statement over the coming months. Any resulting proposed amendment to the ANPS, along with any other proposed amendments, will be subject to public consultation.

This decision marks an important milestone, one that reaffirms the UK’s commitment to maintaining its position as a world leader in aviation, innovation and economic growth. Heathrow is our only hub airport, which supports trade, tourism and hundreds of thousands of jobs, and underpins prosperity across both the south-east and regions of the United Kingdom. If Britain is to remain competitive in the decades ahead, we must ensure that our airport capacity matches our ambition as a modern, outward-looking and confident nation.

The Government’s position is clear: expansion at Heathrow must be cost-effective, minimising the burden on passengers and coming at no cost to the taxpayer. The project will be privately financed, including the core scheme and any associated surface access improvements.

Crucially, expansion must be delivered in a way that aligns with our legal obligations on air quality, environmental protection, noise and climate change.

We recognise that expansion brings both opportunity and responsibility. My Department will therefore continue to work closely with the Civil Aviation Authority, local authorities, community representatives and the wider aviation sector to ensure any scheme is delivered transparently, responsibly and in partnership with those it affects.

Assessment of proposals

Following my update last month to confirm that two proposed schemes remained under active consideration, my Department has now undertaken a further assessment of those two proposed schemes—Heathrow Airport Ltd and Arora Group-Heathrow West Ltd. I would like to thank both promoters of the proposed schemes for providing this additional information, and for their constructive engagement with my Department.

Following a comparative assessment of the remaining proposals for Heathrow expansion, the Government’s view is that the north-west runway scheme brought forward by Heathrow Airport Ltd offers the most credible and deliverable option, principally due to the relative maturity of its proposal, the comparative level of confidence in the feasibility and resilience of its surface access plans, and the stronger comfort it provides in relation to the efficient, resilient and sustainable operations of the airport over the long-term.

The HAL scheme is considered comparatively more mature in its approach to road infrastructure. While the HAL scheme requires major works to the M25, assessment indicates that the HWL scheme would also have a considerable impact on the M25.

We know we must provide as much clarity and certainty for communities affected by expansion at Heathrow, as soon as possible. While HAL’s scheme requires more land, it would require the acquisition of fewer residential properties around the airport than HWL’s scheme.

The runway length proposed by HAL—up to 3.5 km —is considered to be advantageous in terms of providing greater resilience and potential futureproofing for next-generation aircraft when compared with the 2.8 km runway proposed by HWL.

The Government therefore consider that overall, the HAL scheme provides the greatest likelihood of meeting our ambition for a decision on development consent application within this Parliament. This scheme will now inform the ongoing ANPS review. Any scheme identified in an amended ANPS will still need detailed consideration—including matters such as runway length, layout and supporting infrastructure—in any development consent order sought under planning legislation.

Airports National Policy Statement Review

The airports national policy statement provides the policy framework for the Government’s approach to securing additional airport capacity in the south-east of England.

I announced on 22 October that it would be reviewed, particularly to consider updated aviation forecasts and how any changes in policy and legislation—in particular relating to climate and the environment—since its designation in 2018 may need to be reflected, as well as how the Government’s four tests will be applied to expansion. We have begun detailed analytical and policy work to this effect.

Further to this, today I am publishing the Government’s stakeholder engagement approach. This represents an important step in ensuring that the development and review of the ANPS is conducted in a manner that is transparent, inclusive, and informed by a comprehensive range of stakeholder views.

I have always been clear that any proposals for airport expansion must meet the Government’s four tests, including those relating to climate commitments. I am confirming that I have today written to the Climate Change Committee setting out how I intend to engage with it, so that its views can be fully considered as this process progresses.

Regulatory work

As I said in October, rigorous and effective cost control will be essential to the scheme’s success both in minimising any impact on airline charges and costs to passengers and in maintaining credibility with financial markets.

The Civil Aviation Authority is continuing its work to develop the regulatory framework that will support delivery of expansion at Heathrow. It will shortly set out further detail on its approach to early cost recovery by promoters and is today publishing a paper setting out potential future regulatory options for an expanded Heathrow. The Government welcome this work and will continue to co-ordinate closely with the regulator to ensure that any new regulatory framework supports the timely and efficient financing of expansion and, in line with the CAA’s statutory duties, that passengers’ interests are protected and the best possible value is delivered.

This ongoing collaboration between Government and the CAA will continue to align regulatory and policy frameworks as the ANPS review progresses. The Department has a clear interest in ensuring the best possible value and service for passengers and will continue to review the CAA’s independent assessment of regulatory options to achieve this.

Broader programme progress

As we set out in October, the Government have acted in a range of areas that will enable expansion at Heathrow, including through the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, our work on judicial reviews, and the initiation of slot reform. Since October, we have continued to make progress on policies that enable the delivery of an operational third runway at Heathrow.

On airspace modernisation, the Department is today launching a consultation on a package of changes to help streamline airspace design while retaining the important principles of a transparent, evidence-based airspace change process.

Alongside this, we continue to make progress on work to decarbonise aviation, including increasing the uptake of sustainable aviation fuel, and innovation in aviation technology.

This is a historic opportunity for the UK aviation sector and wider economy. The Government are committed to ensuring expansion is delivered in a timely, cost-efficient, and environmentally responsible way, and we will consult on any amendments to the ANPS by July 2026.

Key highlights from the report for corporate travel programmes to consider include:

Risks and mitigation strategies

In 2026, as the global effects of tariffs continue to unfold, Oxford Economics believes the world may face its weakest economic growth since 2009 (excluding 2020), hovering at 2.6%. Inflation is expected to ease only slowly, averaging above 3%. In addition to this economic fragility, a broad range of risks may further compound the efforts of organisations to keep their business travellers safe and operations flowing smoothly.

The primary six risks to consider are extreme weather, regional tensions and ongoing conflicts, changing border policies, the rise of cyberattacks and misinformation arising from the use of AI, the continuing threat of illnesses and disease, and limited options for accommodations and ground transportation during large scale events.

Airfares

Overall, global airfares should see only limited inflation, primarily stimulated by the intercontinental air travel market as opposed to regional travel.

Globally, average ticket prices (ATPs) should rise by only 1.1% in 2026 reflecting weak airfares inflation in the Americas, and in North America especially. ATP increases in other regions should be above the global average, with the strongest inflation likely in Africa and Asia, at 2.5% and 2.0%, respectively.

In addition to airfare changes, the Global Air Practice at BCD’s Advito consultancy has identified five trends for travel buyers to keep in mind. These include a reduction in value of airline corporate contracts, cost avoidance, rising airline fuel surcharges, blanket NDC offerings, and continued travel programme leakage.

Hotel rates

Global hotel rates are forecasted to increase by 4.9% in average daily rates. There are many variables behind the variation in rates in different regions, from rising staffing and labor costs in Turkey to robust leisure demand in Japan. Aggregate figures for rate inflation in Africa, Asia and Europe should all lie within a narrow 4 to 6% range; the strongest rate inflation is expected across the Middle East at 8%. Hotels in Latin America are expected to average 6.4% in 2026. Rate inflation is likely to be weakest in the South-west Pacific and North America, at 2.6% and 2.2%, respectively.

Car rental

Car rental rates will generally continue to rise for corporate customers. A mix of aspects are contributing to this increase, including car rental companies’ acquisition and repair costs, city surcharges and higher parking rates. Corporate travellers are being forced to consider alternative options such as ride-hailing and taxis. In general, BCD expects rate increases in 2026 to be slightly lower than in 2025, sitting in a 2-4% range.

Sustainability

In 2026, sustainability will no longer be just a moral obligation. It is becoming a strategic business priority and a source of competitive advantage. Accountability will dominate the agenda as companies move from pledges to measurable action. According to GBTA’s latest benchmark, overall maturity remains low at 1.4 out of 5, with only 9% of companies applying carbon fees and 15% investing in sustainable aviation fuel.",https://ttgmice.2017.ttgasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/BCD-Travel-Outlook-2026_640.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 06:57:36.035825

The EIB, EBRD, and AfDB express their commitment to advancing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and cleaner energy projects in Africa. This aligns with the global aviation goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, supported by the ICAO Global Framework for SAF.

Regulatory Frameworks

The European Union adopted the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation in October 2023, while the African Union introduced a Continental Strategy for SAF in February 2025. The EU Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, launched in November 2025, emphasizes EU-Africa cooperation on SAF.

Economic and Environmental Impact

SAF is identified as a key driver for aviation decarbonization and economic growth, offering job creation and development opportunities for African states. Current production levels are low, necessitating global efforts to scale up SAF production and deployment.

Global Gateway Initiative

Supporting SAF development in Africa, Latin America/Caribbean, and Asia-Pacific is a Global Gateway flagship initiative. A coordinated effort by Team Europe aims to enhance market access and secure renewable fuel imports, aligning with the Global Europe regulation proposal.

Currently, SAF is being produced at Pertamina’s Cilacap refinery in Central Java, and the company is either developing or planning green refinery capabilities to make such fuel at its facilities in South Sumatra, Riau, West Java and East Kalimantan.

The Indonesian government aims to raise the national SAF blend mandate for international flights to 5 per cent by 2035.

At the recent United Nations climate conference (COP30) in Belem, Brazil, Indonesia said it aims to produce over 1 million kilolitres of SAF annually by 2030, with used cooking oil as a key feedstock.

TURNING USED COOKING OIL INTO JET FUEL

Pertamina’s Cilacap facility is the largest oil refinery in the country, processing 348,000 barrels of crude oil per day and supplying roughly a third of Indonesia’s fuel needs.

It is being developed into a green refinery to produce sustainable aviation fuel, and can yield about 1.4 million litres a day – roughly half the volume of an Olympic-size swimming pool.

About 3 per cent of that comes from used cooking oil.

The refinery converts the used cooking oil into SAF through several chemical processes.

The oil is mixed with kerosene, heated to around 70°C, then transferred to a reactor where it is further heated to over 300°C and passed through layers of catalysts, which trigger and speed up chemical reactions.

Hydrogen is added to stabilise the mixture.

The result is a cleaner fuel suitable for jet engines, while cutting aviation’s carbon footprint by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel.

SCALING UP GREEN REFINERY CAPACITY

To increase Indonesia’s SAF output, Pertamina is working to raise the proportion of used cooking oil in its fuel blends.

Its engineers are also experimenting with catalyst improvements to increase production efficiency.

The current catalyst was developed by Indonesian scientists from Pertamina's technology innovation division in partnership with the Bandung Institute of Technology.

Developing a homegrown catalyst is part of a national initiative to reduce the country’s dependence on imported catalysts.

""Our research and development team is always trying to improve the catalyst so that the used cooking oil content can be increased to more than 3 per cent,"" said process engineer Novan Adhi Prakasa. ""This can also be achieved by increasing the capacity and productivity of the green refinery unit.""

Indonesia’s potential supply of used cooking oil is significant. The country uses about 6 to 7 million tonnes of cooking oil every year, said Pertamina’s deputy president director Oki Muraza.

“If we could collect just 20 per cent of that, like in developed countries, we would have a large amount of raw material – enough to supply the domestic industry.”

FROM KITCHEN WASTE TO CASH

Local communities are already contributing to this growing green supply chain.

In the Tegalreja district, near the Cilacap refinery, residents are selling their used cooking oil at local waste banks instead of pouring it down the drain. Each kilogram fetches around US$0.30.

“Used cooking oil is something every household has. Selling it adds to our income. Even if it’s just a little, it helps,” said Bartinah, a resident of KB Gadis village.

“It gives us motivation and hope that one day, the price could rise even higher, maybe up to 10,000 rupiah (US$0.60) per kilogram.”

Indonesia has a potential supply of around 1 million litres of used cooking oil annually, but about 95 per cent of it is exported to Europe and other parts of Asia.

Community collection initiatives could redirect more of that to domestic SAF production.

“In the beginning, we collected around 80kg to 100kg of used cooking oil a month. Now, it’s up to about 170kg,” said Sri Widowati, a coordinator at the Tegalreja Waste Bank.

PRICE SENSITIVITY REMAINS A CHALLENGE

Indonesia plans to introduce a 1 per cent SAF blend in its aviation fuel by 2027, but the high cost of production remains a major obstacle.

SAF can cost two to five times more than conventional jet fuel.

Industry experts say the government needs to step in to ensure that airlines’ use of SAF doesn’t end up driving up ticket prices.

“The Indonesian market for air transport is highly sensitive towards price. It’s so much so that the government has not allowed any price increase for tickets since 2019,” said Alvin Lie, chairman of the Indonesian Association of Air Transport Service Users.

“Now, the fact is that SAF is still expensive, so even a 1 per cent of SAF in the fuel will drive the cost up and inevitably the cost of air tickets will go up.”

Lie suggested that the government look into removing the 12 per cent value-added tax on aviation fuel and air tickets.

""If the government wants to progress with the use of SAF, the least (it) can do is abolish the value-added tax, both for air tickets as well as fuel for domestic routes,"" he said.

Despite these challenges, Indonesia’s ambition to become a regional leader in sustainable aviation fuel is gradually taking shape.

Real progress will depend on how quickly the country can scale up production and secure a steady supply of feedstock – the waste oils and other organic materials that are refined into sustainable fuel.

Indonesia’s transport sector accounts for around 22 per cent of the country’s energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.

For now, SAF remains central to Indonesia’s net-zero emissions goals – and could be its ticket to cleaner, greener skies.","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--gj-7txFB--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2021-08:cna,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2025/11/25/sustainable_aviation_fuel_1.png?itok=QZPT2cfI",N,,2025-11-25 21:56:11.151454

The SAF Grand Challenge, announced in 2021, aims to scale up domestic production of SAF to replace 100% of aviation fuel (about 35 billion gallons) by 2050. The U.S. Department of Energy Roadmap for SAF notes that these 2050 SAF goals cannot be reached without the use of biomass feedstocks, such as corn stover and dedicated energy crops1.

The US has the potential to produce a wide range of high-yielding energy crops, as well as crop residues from corn and wheat2. The per-unit cost of SAF and GHG intensity of SAF (GHG emissions per mega-joule of SAF) will differ with the feedstocks used3,4,5. There is also considerable spatial heterogeneity in yield and soil carbon sequestration rates for each of these feedstocks across the rainfed region of the U.S., which will affect the cost and GHG intensity of SAF with a feedstock across locations. Thus, the supply of SAF at various prices and the GHG savings with SAF relative to petroleum jet will depend on the mix of feedstocks incentivized across locations and the availability of suitable land, which will affect the amount that can be produced. Crop residues provide a lower-cost feedstock for SAF but have relatively low yield and higher GHG intensity than energy crops because they lead to loss of soil carbon instead of soil carbon sequestration like energy crops (see Supplementary Information (SI) Section 2). Energy crops are high-yielding and have high soil carbon sequestration potential, but they are costly to produce, and their production raises concerns about inducing diversion of land from existing uses.

Energy crops have the potential to be produced on “marginal land”6, and Khanna et al.7 show that economically marginal land (defined as land that is idle and would earn close to zero returns from crop production) would have economic incentives to convert to energy crops because its opportunity cost of conversion (or foregone returns from crop production) is low. However, the production of energy crops may not be limited to marginal land because cropland can also have an economic incentive to convert to energy crops if the biomass price is high. Other non-cropland under grass or pasture may similarly have an economic incentive to produce energy crops.

Since different types of land and locations vary in their suitability, yields of energy crops, and costs of producing energy crops, the availability of various types of land for feedstock production will affect the mix of feedstocks and the location of their production. With heterogeneity in yield per unit land across feedstocks and locations, this in turn will affect the land requirement of various aggregate levels of SAF production, the extent of diversion of cropland for energy crops production, and consequences for food/feed crop production and food crop prices.

The mix of feedstocks and the land requirements for their production also have implications for the GHG intensity of SAF. The production of energy crops on cropland and non-cropland will directly affect carbon stocks on that land8. Furthermore, the diversion of cropland to energy crops can raise food crop prices and indirectly induce the conversion of non-cropland to food crop production. Both the direct and indirect causes of land use change, referred to as induced land use change (ILUC), can lead to changes in carbon stocks in the land and affect the overall GHG intensity of SAF.

Existing research has focused on analyzing the breakeven prices, carbon intensity, and land use requirements of individual feedstocks for SAF. Specifically, Fan et al.9 conducted spatially varying techno-economic and life-cycle analysis to compare the spatially varying breakeven price of SAF and GHG intensity of miscanthus, switchgrass, sorghum, and corn stover, across the rainfed US. Gautam et al.10 examine the amount of cropland that could be converted to miscanthus, sorghum, and switchgrass at a given price of soil carbon sequestration and jet fuel; they consider the potential to produce these feedstocks one at a time and do not examine their competition for land or the competition with food crops. Both these studies incorporate the direct soil carbon effects due to feedstock production, but have not analyzed their potential to be grown on non-cropland and the GHG intensity implications of various levels of SAF production. Global partial equilibrium models (GLOBIOM4,11,12) and general equilibrium economic models (such as GTAP-Bio5,13) have analyzed the GHG intensity of specific biofuel feedstock pathways for SAF one at a time. The US Department of Energy’s Billion-ton Report2,14 has examined the supply of biomass from a variety of different cellulosic feedstocks at various biomass prices.

None of these studies has analyzed the economically optimal mix of feedstocks for various levels of aggregate supply of SAF and the implications of varying constraints of availability of land on which they can be produced for this mix of feedstocks. Existing research has also not quantified the aggregate impacts of scaling up SAF production on GHG emissions and land use change, and the extent to which this will vary with land availability constraints.

The goal of this study is to fill these research gaps by undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the economic and GHG implications of biomass-based SAF production in the US. There exist several different pathways and feedstocks for SAF production. These include the Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway for converting oils and fats to SAF and the Fischer–Tropsch (FT) method for converting cellulosic feedstocks to biomass-based SAF. Our analysis focuses on the Alcohol-to-Jet Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (ATJ-SPK) pathway, which has relatively lower breakeven costs than FT and is not constrained by feedstock availability like HEFA15. We examine the economically optimal supply of biomass-based ATJ-SPK, from a wide range of agricultural feedstocks, under alternative scenarios, and quantify the GHG emissions intensity of various levels of supply of ATJ-SAF (defined to include the life-cycle emissions from feedstock production and conversion to SAF and the ILUC-related changes in soil carbon stocks). The life-cycle emissions intensity includes the emissions of producing the feedstock, conversion to ethanol, and upgrading ethanol to ATJ-SPK; no emission credits were applied to cogenerated gasoline- and diesel-range products (as in ref. 9). The ILUC estimates are those within the US and do not consider international land use change.

We undertake this analysis by integrating the DayCent, a biogeochemical model of yield and GHG balance8 with BEPAM, a partial equilibrium, recursive-dynamic, open economy optimization model16,17, and BioSTEAM, a feedstock-specific process engineering model of biorefineries18,19 (see SI Fig. S1 and BEPAM model validation in SI Table S1 and Fig. S2; DayCent model validation in SI Figs. S3–S5). This modeling framework incorporates spatial heterogeneity in yields, costs, soil carbon sequestration rates, and land availability for a wide range of food/feed crops and biomass sources at a Crop Reporting District (CRD). The biomass sources include energy crops (miscanthus, switchgrass, energy sorghum, energy cane, short rotation woody crops (poplar and willow)), as well as crop residues from corn and wheat. The model considers competing demands for cropland and non-cropland for projected food, feed, and feedstock production and determines the welfare-maximizing allocation of land to a wide range of food and energy crops subject to technology, material balance, and land availability constraints. It determines land competition and allocation among alternative uses depending on the net present value of returns to each use. In addition to available cropland, we consider various types of non-cropland that can be converted to crop production, including economically marginal land, as well as grasslands in the US (SI Table S2).

Assessing the availability of economically marginal land is challenging, and Jiang et al.20 use a history of satellite data on land use change to identify 4.3 million hectares of economically marginal land with confidence in the US; of this, 1.7 million hectares is idle and in the rainfed region that is suitable for energy crop production. There is a relatively larger amount of idle land that can be classified as economically marginal with uncertainty in the rainfed region (16.9 million hectares) (details in SI, Section 1; SI Fig. S6). We construct three scenarios of land area that can be potentially converted to crop (food crop and energy crop) production based on Jiang et al.20. These are implemented in BEPAM as land availability constraints, defined at the CRD level (see “Methods” section, SI Fig. S1). In each of these three scenarios, we analyze the incentives for the available land to produce a range of biomass feedstocks under a wide range of biomass prices. These scenarios are motivated by the potential for concerns about ILUC driving policy restrictions on the types of land that can grow energy crops (similar to the restrictions placed by the Renewable Fuel Standard on only using land brought into cultivation before 2007 for producing feedstocks for renewable fuel21). Concerns about expanding cropland and potential for loss of ecosystem services and stored soil carbon stocks may limit energy crops to cropland and “marginal” land with certainty. On the other hand, the desire to ease effects on food crop prices may lead to a willingness to allow conversion of non-cropland (marginal land with uncertainty and grasslands and pastureland) to energy crops. We examine the implications of these land availability scenarios for the supply of SAF at various prices and for food crop prices.

Since there are varying estimates of the carbon stocks that can be released due to land use change, referred to here as emissions factors (EFs)22,23,24,25,26,27, we consider three different model-based estimates of these ILUC-related carbon emissions in computing the overall GHG savings due to SAF production with each land availability and biomass price scenario13,28,29,30. We compare the GHG emissions intensity of SAF with that of the energy-equivalent level of petroleum jet to determine the potential GHG savings with the displacement of petroleum jet. We compare these savings in GHG emissions (difference between the GHG intensity of petroleum jet and SAF) with the foregone opportunities for nature-based carbon sequestration that would have occurred if that land were instead maintained/restored as grasslands31.

Our analysis makes several scientific contributions. By linking an economic model with a biogeochemical and process engineering model, our analysis shows that assuming that energy crops would be produced only on cropland10, or only on marginal land6,32 will lead to underestimation of the economically viable potential to produce SAF from cellulosic feedstocks in the rainfed region of the US. Restricting energy crop production to cropland only, limits the potential of SAF production to 83 B l (24 billion gallons) with a carbon intensity of 23 gCO2e MJ−1. Allowing non-cropland conversion for energy crop production could allow the US to meet the SAF Grand Challenge with cellulosic feedstocks and lower carbon intensity of 15.5 gCO2e MJ−1. This leads to a counter-intuitive finding that the GHG intensity of SAF decreases as more cropland and non-cropland is allowed to be converted to energy crop production, even after we account for land use change emissions. This is due to the high carbon sequestration potential of energy crops, which more than offsets the initial reduction in carbon stocks due to conversion of non-cropland to energy crop production. Our analysis also shows the implications of meeting the SAF Grand Challenge for food crop prices; we find that it would require converting 29 million hectares (12%) of cropland and non-cropland (about half of which would be cropland) to energy crops and raise the food crop price index by 18%. Our analysis highlights the choices we confront, including land use change, crop price increase, and GHG intensity reduction, in promoting SAF for decarbonizing the aviation sector and informs policy choices for SAF production from cellulosic feedstocks.

Economically optimal supply of SAF

The total amount of cellulosic feedstock and SAF that was economically optimal to produce varied as biomass prices increased from $40 Mg−1 to $140 Mg−1 and as the flexibility for non-cropland to convert to crop production increased across the three scenarios of non-cropland availability (Fig. 1A–C and SI Table S3). Biomass production was economically viable at a minimum biomass price of $40 Mg−1, with a maximum of 480 million metric tons (M Mg) of biomass (measured in dry tons with zero moisture) being produced when the price was as high as $140 Mg−1 in scenario (I) (CL + MLC) with cropland and least marginal land availability (CL + MLC). In scenarios (II) and (III) (CL + MLC + U and CL + MLC + U + G) with moderate and high availability of land for bioenergy crop production, total biomass supply increased to 628 M Mg and 900 M Mg (about one billion US tons), respectively, at a price of $140 Mg−1.

The biomass prices analyzed above implied SAF prices ranging from $1.1 l−1 to $1.5 l−1 (in 2016 dollars) to cover the cost of feedstock, transportation cost of feedstock, production cost of cellulosic ethanol (net of co-product electricity credit), and the cost of conversion to ATJ-SPK (SAF). SAF production at these prices ranged from 29 to 171 B l (8–45 B gallons) across the three land availability scenarios (Fig. 1). As the availability of low-cost land for production of energy crops increased, the amount of SAF that could be produced at a given price per liter of SAF increased (see SI Fig. S7). At $1.4 l−1, the amount of SAF production ranged from 83 to 140 B l (22–37 B gallons); the upper end of this range of SAF production could displace 100% of the anticipated petroleum jet consumption in 2050. However, the minimum refinery-gate price of SAF of $1.4 l−1 ($5.3 gallon−1) is several-fold higher than the price of conventional jet fuel of $0.34 l−1 ($1.3 gallon−1) in 2016 dollars, and about twice as high as subsequent prices that rose to $0.8 l−1 ($3 gallon−1) in 2022. The gap in the price of SAF and the price of jet fuel of $0.33-$0.46 l−1 is substantially larger than the SAF tax credit that is currently being offered in the US1.

Economically optimal mix and location of cellulosic feedstock production

The mix of feedstocks produced varied with the price of biomass and the availability of marginal land and grassland. Corn stover and wheat straw were the lowest cost sources of biomass and became viable at biomass prices between $40 and $60 Mg−1. As biomass price increased, it created incentives for increasing the area under continuous corn and no-till (which allows a larger share of residue to be harvested) and reducing the area under corn-soybean rotation and the share of land under conventional tillage.

As biomass price increased and non-cropland availability increased, the share of two high-yielding but more costly feedstocks, miscanthus and energy sorghum, increased across all scenarios (Fig. 1 and SI Table S3). Higher biomass price made it economically viable to convert cropland to these energy crops. The share of other energy crops, such as willow and poplar, was positive but small because of their low yields and suitability for production in limited regions in the US.

The optimal locations for producing miscanthus, switchgrass, energy sorghum, and energy cane varied across the rainfed region of the US (see SI Fig. S8) due to differences in their yields, costs of production, and the opportunity cost of converting land for their production. Miscanthus production was economically viable largely in the Midwest and Atlantic states, while switchgrass was economically viable in the southern states. Energy cane production was confined to the Gulf states, while energy sorghum production was dispersed throughout the region.

Land-use change effects of SAF production

The type and amount of land used for cellulosic feedstock production varied with biomass price and the assumptions about land availability in the different scenarios, as shown in Fig. 2 and SI Table S4. In Scenario (I) (CL + MLC), energy crop production occurred mainly on cropland, followed by cropland that would become surplus in the future (if biomass price had remained at zero) and a small amount of marginal land. The maximum amount of SAF production would be limited to 91 B l (24 B gallons), of which 61 B l (16 B gallons) would be from energy crops and the rest from crop residues and require about 19 M hectares of land that was largely cropland. In scenario (II) (CL + MLC + U) with greater availability of marginal land for energy crops, the same amount of SAF could be produced with less diversion of cropland and greater conversion of marginal land to energy crops. The total amount of SAF that could now be produced is 120 B l (32 B gallons) and would require converting 27 M ha to energy crops, of which about 9 M ha would be marginal land.

In Scenario (III) (CL + MLC + U + G) with the potential for a large amount of grassland to convert to crops, the amount of SAF production can increase to 171 B l (45 B gallons) at a biomass price of $140 Mg−1. The production of 140 B l (37 B gallons) of SAF will require 39 M ha of land dedicated to energy crops, of which about 53% would be from non-cropland (SI Fig. S9 and Table S4). Despite the availability of large amounts of non-cropland in Scenario (III), cropland will be converted to produce energy crops, because much of the non-cropland is in the Great Plains and west of it (as shown in SI Fig. S6), where yields of energy crops are low and land is not rainfed and the cost of biomass production is higher on non-cropland than on cropland.

Production of energy crops will induce some spatial changes in food crop production and grazing land available for cattle. We find that in Scenario (III) with 37 B gallons of SAF production, there will be a loss of 11.7 million hectares of crop acreage in the rainfed region, and a 0.4 million hectare increase in irrigated acreage in states like Texas, Colorado, and California (SI Fig. S10). The conversion of non-cropland to energy crops reduced the availability of grazing land in some states (e.g., Arkansas, Texas, and Kentucky) and increased it in other states, such as Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Montana. Overall, however, there was only a marginal effect on the number of cattle and the quantity of beef production and its price.

Effect of SAF production on food crop prices

As biomass prices increased, more cropland would be diverted from food/feed crop production for energy crops. We find that production of the major crops included in the economic model, such as soybeans, wheat, and sorghum, would decline by more than 15% in the case with a biomass price of $140 Mg−1 relative to the case with a biomass price of zero (SI Fig. S11A). This will also result in a substantial (15–25%) reduction in the exports of these crops (SI Fig. S11B). The reduction in crop production and exports will lead to an increase in crop prices (SI Fig. S12). We computed the Laspeyres Price Index for three major food crops, corn, soybeans, and wheat, at various levels of SAF production in 2030. As SAF production increased beyond 76 B l (20 B gallons), this index increased by 15–30%; the extent of the increase was negatively related to the availability of non-cropland for conversion to crop production. The reduction in crop production and exports and the increase in food crop prices for a given level of SAF production were largest in Scenario (I), in which total active cropland for corn and soybeans was reduced by up to 10% and converted to energy crops. In Scenario (III), with the highest availability of non-cropland, the increase in food crop prices would be smaller because there would be less pressure on the use of land for crop production; an 18% increase in the food crop price index would accompany 37 B gallons of SAF production in Scenario (III) and 20 B gallons of SAF production in Scenario (I). Soybean prices increase more than corn prices because the area under soybeans sees a greater reduction than the area under corn as biomass prices increase. This is because the demand for corn stover creates incentives to switch from corn-soybean rotation to continuous corn, and this reduces the acreage under corn less than that under soybeans. Wheat prices increase the most due to lower opportunity cost of converting wheat acreage to energy crops compared to acreage under corn and soybean in the Midwest and the negligible effects of demand for wheat straw on wheat acreage; however, at the highest SAF price simulated here, there is significant conversion of soybean acreage to energy crops and a higher increase in soybean price compared to wheat.

GHG implications

Our estimates of the GHG intensity of SAF show that it declines as the scale of aggregate biomass and SAF production increases and as land availability increases (Fig. 3). This is because, as SAF production scales up at higher SAF prices, the feedstock mix transitions from being largely crop residues to having a higher share of energy crops. The ILUC emissions, which include a reduction in soil carbon stocks due to conversion of non-cropland to crop production and due to harvesting of crop residues (see SI Fig. S5), as well as the gain in soil carbon stocks due to energy crop production, become increasingly small and even negative in Scenarios (II) and (III) as SAF production increases. ILUC emissions are positive at low biomass prices due to the loss in soil carbon stocks caused by the harvesting of even limited amounts of crop residue. These ILUC become overall negative at higher biomass prices as the share of energy crops in the biomass mix increases; the soil carbon sequestration due to energy crop production is much larger than the carbon emissions generated by the conversion of non-cropland due to their production. We estimated the ILUC emissions with three different EFs and found that the ILUC-related GHG intensity is generally highest with the CCLUB EF and lowest with the DayCent EF. The overall GHG intensity of SAF was estimated to range between 23 and 27 gCO2e MJ−1 when there were 55–89 B l (15–24 B gallons) of SAF with the least marginal land availability. The GHG intensity of SAF would be reduced to 13–25 gCO2e MJ−1 when there were 65–171 B l (17–45 B gallons) of production of SAF with the most generous marginal land availability. The reduction in GHG emissions intensity of SAF ranged from 75% with 24 B gallons of SAF production in Scenario (I) to 83% with 37 B gallons of SAF production in Scenario (III) (SI Fig. S13). Despite differences in ILUC across different EF modeling approaches, the difference in estimates of net GHG intensity with the three EFs was small and within ±6% on average (see Fig. 3). The two alternative ILUC EFs increased the GHG intensity of SAF from the reference range of 13–27 gCO2e MJ−1 to 22–30 gCO2e MJ−1 (see SI Table S5).

A higher level of SAF production and non-cropland availability also led to a greater amount of aggregate GHG savings (due to greater displacement of energy-equivalent jet fuel) relative to the scenario with zero biomass price (Fig. 4). At a given price of SAF, the GHG savings increased as the amount of non-cropland for conversion to energy crops increased. These savings ranged from about 207 M Mg CO2e with 24 B gallons of SAF in Scenario (I) to about 359 M Mg CO2e with 37 B gallons of SAF in Scenario (III); these represented 75% and 83% of emissions from the aviation sector with energy equivalent gallons of petroleum jet fuel consumption (SI Fig. S14 and Table S6). These savings remained substantial even after we considered the uncertainty in various modeling assumptions about crop yields, SAF production costs, and ILUC EFs. The overall potential for reduction in GHG emissions from the aviation sector would range from 163 to 261 M Mg CO2e with 24 B gallons of SAF in Scenario (I) to 295–444 M Mg CO2e with 37 B gallons of SAF in Scenario (III) (Fig. 4).

Although we found that SAF production resulted in GHG savings relative to petroleum jet, the change in soil carbon stock varied over time (SI Fig. S15A). The conversion of land to energy crops generated an initial soil carbon loss derived from soil disturbance during the conversion of non-cropland to cropland (carbon debt). This soil carbon debt was larger at higher biomass and SAF prices, and as land availability increased due to a higher share of energy crops. The carbon debt payback period decreased with larger biomass price and land availability because there was greater production of miscanthus in these scenarios, and miscanthus had a high rate of soil carbon sequestration. We found that the ILUC due to energy crop production led to a soil carbon debt that would take 5–7 years to pay back through additional soil carbon sequestration by energy crops, with the shortest period occurring at the highest level of biomass price and land availability. The corresponding payback periods with CCLUB and AEZ-EF EFs were very close to those with the DayCent model. The 5–7 payback period of soil carbon debt was found to be robust to alternative assumptions of parameters analyzed in the sensitivity analysis.

We compared these savings with the foregone soil carbon sequestration that could have been achieved in the absence of biomass production (that is, with a biomass price of zero). The payback period required to compensate for the foregone soil carbon sequestration by energy crop production alone extended to 7–14 years across all scenarios; it was shortest in Scenario (I) with the lowest amount of forgone soil carbon sequestration and longest in Scenario (III). Corresponding payback periods for CCLUB and AEZ-EF were 5–12 years and 8–15 years, respectively, close to those with the DayCent model. These payback periods were significantly lower than the 90-year repayment period associated with producing corn grain ethanol on land under the Conservation Reserve Program33. Our findings are consistent with the results from a prior study that a 0–5 year payback period was achievable with biofuels supplied by miscanthus grown on grasslands at a global scale34.

However, this payback period would be reduced to less than 1 year when potential fossil fuel displacement benefits were considered, and was similar to all three LUC EFs (see SI Fig. S15B). After including the GHG savings due to the displacement of fossil fuels, we found that the GHG savings with SAF production were 20-fold larger than the savings obtained by restoring abandoned cropland and marginal land to grassland as in Scenario (I), and 8-fold larger than the level obtained by preserving the converted grasslands in Scenario (III).

Meeting the SAF Grand Challenge will require substantially expanding SAF production from 16 million gallons currently to more than 35 B gallons in the coming decades. With substantial shares of corn and soybeans already being used for biofuel, expansion of SAF production is expected to require going beyond food crops to cellulosic feedstocks. There are many choices of cellulosic feedstocks, including crop residues, perennial energy crops, and short rotation woody crops, and considerable spatial heterogeneity in their yields, costs of production, and GHG intensity across the rainfed region. There is also a policy choice of the types of land, cropland, marginal land, and grasslands, which should be allowed to produce energy crops to meet the demand for SAF. Our analysis shows the trade-offs that scaling up of SAF production will pose for land use change, GHG intensity, and food crop prices. We find that as the amount of non-cropland available to produce SAF feedstocks was allowed to increase, the amount of cropland converted to energy crops decreased, and the impact on food crop prices decreased. Moreover, the GHG intensity of SAF also decreased because it would become economically viable to produce more energy crops, which would lead to an increase in soil carbon sequestration that was greater than the loss in soil carbon stocks due to land use change.

More specifically, 24–37 B gallons of SAF production would require converting about 8–12% of available cropland, marginal land, and non-cropland in the model to energy crops. The increase in SAF production would reduce food/feed crop production and exports and increase crop prices; the extent to which this is the case varies across crops. The impact on some crops, such as soybeans and wheat, for which the US is a large producer and exporter in the world market, could pose risks to food security within the US and internationally.

The effects of a given level of SAF production on food crop prices were negatively related to the availability of non-cropland; 24 B gallon of SAF production would be accompanied by 30% increase in crop price index if feedstock production is restricted to cropland and to 15% increase in crop price index if marginal land and grassland can be utilized for feedstock production and a 37 B gallon SAF production would be accompanied by a 18% increase in the food crop price index. Additionally, allowing 24 B gallons of SAF feedstock production to expand on grasslands would result in a lower GHG intensity of 20.6 gCO2e MJ−1 compared to 22.7 gCO2e MJ−1 with restricting it to cropland and marginal land with confidence only.

The production of SAF from crop residues alone would reduce GHG emissions intensity by 50% relative to the level with a biomass price of zero. With higher levels of land conversion to energy crop production, the GHG emissions intensity reduction with SAF production of 24–37 B gallons ranged from 75% to 83% relative to petroleum jet. We also find that conversion of marginal and grasslands to energy crops that displace fossil fuels can lead to greater GHG savings than can be achieved by restoring and maintaining land as grasslands.

A key challenge to scaling up biomass-based SAF is its high cost relative to the price of petroleum jet. The SAF tax credit per unit of SAF currently being offered is insufficient to cover this price gap. Our analysis can be used to determine the tax credit (gap between the price of SAF and the price of petroleum jet per unit) that will be needed to incentivize various levels of biomass-based SAF production. It shows that the tax credit needed to induce a given volume of SAF will be lower as the land availability constraint is eased to include more marginal and non-cropland. Additionally, our analysis shows that given the numerous choices for feedstocks that differ in their carbon intensity, a tax credit per unit SAF that increases as the carbon intensity of SAF decreases will be more effective in inducing low-carbon SAF than a volumetric tax credit. The latter will incentivize the lowest cost feedstocks and not the feedstocks that have the lowest carbon intensity but relatively high cost of production.

There are several technical and infrastructural challenges to scaling up energy crop production, particularly on non-cropland, that were not considered in this analysis. Scaling up energy crop production will require planting material that could take several years to build. It may also require diverting non-cropland from other services such as hunting, open space, or wilderness, and this may make landowners reluctant to convert it to energy crops (Skevas et al.35); this could increase the opportunity cost of producing energy crops on this land and the biomass price needed to induce their production. Additionally, significant investment may be needed to create the roads and other infrastructure that will enable industrial-scale production of energy crops on land that had been abandoned from agriculture. The focus of this study is on analyzing the supply side of SAF production at the refinery gate and its land use change implications. We do not consider the transportation of SAF from biorefineries to the airports. Our analysis informs optimal location choices for feedstock production but leaves the biorefinery sitting to future research.

Our analysis also assumed that landowners would choose the crop with the highest discounted value of returns over a time period. Risk-averse farmers will also consider the riskiness of income streams with conventional crops and energy crops. High upfront costs of establishment, time lags between planting and harvesting of perennial energy crops, and the need for long-term commitments to earn returns over the lifespan of the crop can raise the biomass price at which farmers would be willing to grow these crops36.

The biomass production and GHG savings obtained here at various biomass prices and land availability scenarios should, therefore, be an upper bound. Our analysis focused on the technical potential to displace petroleum jet and mitigate GHG emissions. The extent to which biomass-based SAF will displace jet fuel in the market will depend on market conditions and may be limited by changes in oil prices due to large-scale SAF production, which may lead to a rebound effect in domestic and global fuel markets.

The supply of SAF under various land availability constraints simulated here is determined under implicit assumptions about macroeconomic factors, such as growth in population, growth in Gross Domestic Product, and so on. These factors can affect demand for food crops and derived products over time, and the competition for cropland with SAF feedstocks. The framework developed here can be extended by specifying alternative scenarios of demand for food crops and derived products, induced by macro-economic drivers, and simulating their effects on the availability of cropland for SAF feedstock production and its implications for the supply of SAF.

While scale-up of SAF is essential for decarbonizing the aviation sector, its deployment should be carefully managed to avoid worsening energy security in a climate-disrupted world. A diversified portfolio of feedstock sources for SAF and a mix of alternative fuels in the aviation sector may be needed to increase resilience to extreme events and climate change.

Lastly, we do not consider the potential to produce forest biomass for bioenergy or the implications of biomass markets for the conversion of land between crops and forest. We refer readers to Valin et al.37 and the Billion Ton Study14, which find a small share of biomass (for bioenergy) that would be produced from forests in the EU and US, respectively; the latter also notes that much of the land use change from forest land is expected to be towards urban land rather than cropland. We leave further investigation of these issues for future research.

Alternative scenarios

We obtained biomass supply curves, over a wide range of biomass prices, and their GHG outcomes under three scenarios that differed in their definition of land assumed to be available for conversion to crop production (see SI Fig. S1). Specifically we considered three land availability scenarios: Scenario (I) assumed that cropland (CL) and economically marginal land with confidence (CL + MLC) can convert to crop production; Scenario (II) assumed that cropland and economically marginal land with confidence and with uncertainty (CL + MLC + U) can convert to crop production; Scenario (III) assumed that cropland, as well as marginal land with confidence and uncertainty and permanent grassland (CL + MLC + U + G) can convert to cropland (see SI Fig. S6 and Table S2 for detailed description of land types).

With each of the land availability scenarios, we simulated the economic incentives, with biomass prices ranging from zero to $140 Mg−1, to produce a variety of energy crops and crop residues. We determined the type of land that will be converted to energy crops and their implications for land use change. In addition, in each of these scenarios, we also accounted for cropland that will become idle (surplus) over the 2016–2030 period in the absence of any biomass production (with a biomass price of zero) as growth in crop productivity outpaces demand for agricultural commodities. We allowed it to convert to energy crop production in scenarios with a positive price of biomass.

With each of the three land availability scenarios and biomass prices, we considered three alternative estimates of EFs. These are obtained from (i) DayCent Model simulations (DayCent-EF)8 (ii) Carbon Calculator for Land Use and Land Management Change from Biofuels Production (CCLUB-EF) based on CENTURY model38, and (iii) Agro-ecological zone emission factor model (AEZ-EF)26,27,29 (for more details see SI Section 5). The limitations and strengths of these models have been discussed in the existing literature22,26,27,39.

Modeling the economic incentives for land allocation

The version of BEPAM (Biofuel and Environmental Policy Analysis Model) applied here models the agricultural sector and determines economically optimal land-use and feedstock mix at the US scale by maximizing the sum of agricultural sector consumers’ and producers’ surplus subject to various resource balances, land availability, and technological constraints under a range of biomass prices, from zero to $140 Mg−1 over the 2016–2030 period. The model endogenously determines optimal land use allocation for thirteen row crops and six energy crops on both cropland and non-cropland endogenously based on the biomass prices, availability of land, and the net returns to crop production. The model includes several sources of biomass, including herbaceous energy crops (miscanthus, switchgrass, energy sorghum, energy cane), short rotation woody crops (poplar and willow), and crop residues (corn stover and wheat straw). It also includes livestock production and various processed commodity markets. In the crop and livestock markets, primary crop and livestock commodities are consumed either domestically or traded with the rest of the world. Domestic and export demand for each of the agricultural commodities is exogenously given. The model simulates food/feed crop, livestock, and biomass production, consumption, and prices that ensure market demand and supply are in equilibrium at various biomass prices.

The model was applied to simulate the land-use decisions for 304 CRDs by incorporating the spatially heterogeneous yields of different crops obtained from DayCent and returns to producing them, and land availability constraints. The DayCent model was applied to simulate yields and soil carbon sequestration with row crops (corn and soybeans), corn stover, and energy crops on cropland and on marginal land. This integrated modeling framework endogenously determined annual future returns and costs of production of each type of crop on each type of land (e.g., cropland, marginal land) at the CRD level. The costs of inputs and field operations were calculated at the CRD level for each crop and land type. The opportunity cost of land for producing energy crops was endogenously determined by the shadow price of the land constraint in the model.

Land allocation in BEPAM is determined by assuming that landowners use a 10-year rolling horizon to make decisions. Land is converted to alternative uses depending on the net present value of returns to alternative uses over the rolling horizon, including the cost of land conversion. The model is run for 10 years at a time and uses the first year’s solution to update market conditions and then runs the model again for the next 10 years, and so on, with a rolling horizon. Specifically, the model first solves for the 2016–2025 period; we then take the first-year solution values, such as land allocation among different uses and crop prices as ‘realized’, move the horizon one year forward, and solve the new problem, and iterate until the problem is solved for year 2030 (the last simulation for the period 2030–2039).

Since our focus is on analyzing the incremental land use effects of cellulosic feedstock production at various biomass prices, we keep all other demands on land the same as in the zero biomass case. We assumed that production of first-generation biofuels is maintained at their level in 2016 across scenarios and over the simulation period. For simplicity, annual corn-based ethanol production is assumed to be at the maximum permitted level of 15 billion gallons, and the model does not consider exports of corn ethanol. Demands for other first-generation biofuels are exogenously fixed at 2016 levels following the EIA Outlook.

We used three-year (2014–2016) average prices, consumption, exports, and imports of crop and livestock commodities to calibrate the domestic demand, export demand, and import supply functions for all commodities. Domestic demands, export demands, and import supply curves were assumed to grow over time at exogenously specified rates based on the FAPRI 2010 U.S. and World Agricultural Outlook. In our model, we assumed the average annual shift rates presented in this outlook applied to the entire simulated period. More details of the BEPAM and DayCent model and their validation can be found in the SI (Sections 2 and 3; SI Figs. S2–S5 and Table S1).

BEPAM has several features that make it appropriate for the analysis in this paper. First, it has a high level of spatial heterogeneity, which enables a more detailed representation of agricultural activities at the CRD-level (for 304 CRDs in the US). This enables us to incorporate spatial heterogeneity in yields, carbon sequestration and costs of production of various cellulosic feedstocks at a finer scale relative to existing integrated models which are at an agro-ecological zone, sub-national or US water basin level (e.g., GTAP and GCAM-USA)29,40,41 and to endogenously determine the mix of various energy crops that will be produced at various biomass prices and land availability scenarios. As our analysis shows, there is a significant difference in yields across feedstocks and the optimal location of feedstocks. Second, BEPAM enables us to develop an integrated framework with DayCent and BioSTEAM to include the spatially explicit yields and soil carbon sequestration with various feedstocks and to incorporate the techno-economic and life-cycle analysis for various biomass feedstocks and conversion processes at a feedstock-specific level. Third, it is a multi-period, recursive dynamic model, which makes it well-suited for studying perennial energy crops and updating the agricultural market conditions farmers face dynamically. The rolling horizon setting is more consistent with farmers’ planning process than the traditional forward-looking models, which involve a single run of the model for the entire simulation period.

Availability of non-cropland

We identified economically marginal land as land that is intermittently switching between crop and non-crop (see ref. 20). Estimates of economically marginal land availability in our modeling framework were derived from the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) provided by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) using methods described in Jiang et al.20 (see SI Section 1). We distinguished between land that can be classified as marginal with statistical confidence and marginal with uncertainty, as well as land that can be classified as permanent grassland and permanent cropland based on the analysis by Jiang et al.20. They found that the amount of land that could be classified as economically marginal with certainty in the rainfed region was small (1.7 million hectares) and that there was a substantial amount of land in the rainfed region that could only be classified as economically marginal with uncertainty (16.9 million hectares) in 2016. They also identified permanent grassland, which had been permanently in grass over the 2008–2015 period. Since we are unable to distinguish between grassland and pastureland from CDL data, both categories are included in the category defined as grassland. The availability and spatial distribution of non-cropland under each scenario are shown in SI Fig. S6.

GHG emissions assessment

The GHG emission effects of SAF accounted for in this study included the following two components: (1) life-cycle GHG emissions (that occur aboveground and are also referred to as supply chain emissions) and include all emissions due to the harvesting of crop residues for biomass (including harvesting and replacement fertilizer application), planting of energy cops to their harvest (emissions from fertilizer, chemicals, fuels and machinery), transport to the refinery and conversion to SAF in the refinery. The process of conversion of biomass to (ATJ-SPK) SAF leads to the co-generation of electricity that displaces grid electricity and creates a co-product carbon credit that is subtracted from these life-cycle emissions, (2) induced land-use change related changes in soil-carbon stocks caused directly by the production of energy crops and removal of crop residues for biomass, including soil organic carbon, nitrous oxide and methane fluxes and changes in vegetation when energy crops are planted on non-cropland, as well as changes in soil carbon stocks caused indirectly by the change in crop and land prices induced by the conversion of cropland to energy crop production (see SI Section 2).

We assessed GHG savings from the aviation sector by comparing the sum of the life-cycle and ILUC emissions with SAF production with corresponding emissions from petroleum jet, assuming displacement on an energy-equivalent basis. We quantified the GHG emissions in 2030 from sources described above. We compared these emissions with the emissions from petroleum jet fuel on an energy-equivalent basis. This represents the technical GHG mitigation potential of cellulosic feedstocks since it does not consider any feedback effects on aviation fuel markets of large-scale displacement of jet fuel. The GHG emissions from converting cellulosic feedstocks to cellulosic ethanol in gCO2e MJ−1 were measured based on the conversion coefficients of producing cellulosic ethanol from different feedstocks and carbon emission intensity as simulated by BioSTEAM. We assumed that cellulosic ethanol was converted to SAF via the ATJ-SPK pathway, and no emission credits were included for cogenerated gasoline- and diesel products. The emissions of upgrading ethanol to SAF were calculated based on the emission factor of producing jet from ethanol (21 gCO2e MJ−1 jet) reported by the GREET model. Emissions of converting ethanol to SAF were assumed to remain the same for all feedstock-based cellulosic ethanol.

We then compared the GHG savings with SAF obtained above to the foregone carbon sequestration on land that is converted to energy crop production instead of remaining or being restored to grasslands. We assessed this by including soil carbon sequestration that would have been obtained by (1) preserving grassland as unharvested; (2) restoring surplus cropland to grassland, and (3) restoring marginal land to grassland (instead of converting these lands to energy crops). Details of the methods for the computation of GHG savings and forgone carbon sequestration are presented in the SI Section 5. The average rates of annual soil carbon sequestration per hectare with various feedstocks are shown in SI Fig. S5.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-02913-x/MediaObjects/43247_2025_2913_Figa_HTML.png,N,,2025-11-25 21:56:15.880491

Olivia Palamountain reports

Magnifica Air has revealed plans for a new kind of airline that sits between private aviation and first-class commercial travel, offering what it describes as the privacy of a jet with the operational scope of a major carrier.

When it launches in 2027, the Florida-based startup will introduce a fleet of Airbus A220-300 and A321neo aircraft, each configured for between 45 and 54 passengers. The aim is to create a quieter, more personal flying experience at what the company claims will be a fraction of the cost of chartering a private jet.

According to The Independent, the airline believes it has identified “a gap in the market” for wealthy travellers who want a calmer, more human experience without paying private jet prices.

Boutique design

The concept blends low-density cabins with the scale and consistency of scheduled operations. Aircraft interiors will feature private suites, hand-crafted business-class seating and open spaces created by removing overhead bins. Renderings shared by the airline show two-by-two seating in warm brown tones, residential-style sofa suites and an onboard bar, highlighting its ambition to make the cabin feel more like a boutique hotel than an aircraft. Lighting will adapt throughout the flight, menus will be designed with chefs and sommeliers, and service will follow the rhythm of a private members’ club.

Seamless connections

Magnifica Air’s guest journey begins long before boarding. Travellers will arrive at private terminals only 30 minutes before departure, where baggage will be handled by concierge staff and security screening will take place within the lounge. Aided by facial recognition technology, the process is designed to be quick and unobtrusive. From there, guests will be escorted directly to the aircraft by sprinter van or private ramp walk. On arrival, baggage will be returned within minutes, chauffeurs will meet passengers at the kerb, and onward lounges will be available for those continuing their journey.

Clean tech

The company places sustainability at the centre of its design. Magnifica Air will launch as carbon neutral, supported by more than seven million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel integrated into its East Coast operations each year. Lounges will run on solar power and the airline is exploring hybrid-electric aircraft as part of future planning. On board, aircraft will introduce the world’s first commercial-scale surface purification system using Aviation Clean Air technology, paired with a humidification system to reduce the drying effects of long-haul travel.

Experience trips

The route network will begin with six to seven daily flights, connecting Miami, New York, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, Dallas and Houston, with seasonal services to Napa Valley and the Caribbean. Magnifica Air has already signed agreements for six Airbus A220s and two A321neos, with the first scheduled for delivery in early 2027 before refurbishment and entry to service later that year. Alongside scheduled flights, curated “experience trips” will be offered to cultural and sporting events, including Art Basel and Formula 1.

Affordable luxury

Supporting the launch is a leadership team drawn from both private and commercial aviation, led by chief executive Wade Black. He describes the airline as a response to a fragmented premium market where customers must choose between crowded first-class cabins or costly private jet charters. As he explains: “This is the space in between.” The Independent reports that the company’s blog positions the airline as “a fully private, seamless experience for a fraction of what you’d pay to charter a jet.”

Member perks

Magnifica Air has also introduced The Seven Club, a membership platform that blends air travel with art, wellness and cultural access. Members will receive priority booking, concierge support and invitations to curated events, from artist previews at Art Basel to tailored programmes at major sporting fixtures. Family and corporate memberships will be available through a tiered structure, with prices starting from US$14,950.

Black describes the programme as an opportunity to bring “joy and excitement back to the sky,” positioning the club as an emotional extension of the airline rather than a list of perks.",https://globetrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MAGAIR-INTERIOR-FINAL-3.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 21:56:23.189595

Now, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have discovered a novel way to address that problem—by converting food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets industry standards without relying on fossil fuel blends. Their process, described in a new Nature Communications study, could help the aviation industry meet its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The process in a nutshell is this: The researchers convert food waste into biocrude oil through a thermochemical conversion process called hydrothermal liquefaction, or HTL. Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil, and finally, they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel.

This approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE), part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at U. of I.

In this project, the researchers used waste from a nearby food processing facility. Globally, over 30% of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain — from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and recycling waste helps promote sustainability.

But HTL can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including food, sewage sludge, algal bloom, swine manure, and agricultural residue.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used a process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur—leaving behind only the hydrocarbons needed for fuel. After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.

To optimize the hydrotreatment process, the researchers adjusted variables such as temperature, catalyst and hydrogen loads, and retention time to identify the best conditions for producing jet fuel. They then tested their sustainable aviation fuel against rigorous standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration. Their SAF sample passed Tier Alpha and Beta prescreening tests and met all specifications for conventional jet fuel—without requiring any additives or blending with fossil fuels.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Uof_I_Nov25_0d6c61fd79.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 17:56:46.348756

After harvest, farmland often sits fallow and unused until growers seed in the next crop. Soil can erode, weeds can take root, and farmers don’t make any money during that time. Cover crops can eliminate or reduce some of those issues, but many farmers have concerns about their effects on soil quality, a reduced growing window for their primary crop, and the inability to sell the cover crop.

In a paper recently published in the journal Biomass and Bioenergy, a team led by Washington State University scientists looked at four cover crops grown for multiple years in western and central Washington fields. Two showed promising results.

Triticale, a hybrid of wheat and rye, produced the highest yields, and hairy vetch, a vine-like legume with hairy leaves, provided stable yields at low costs while adding nitrogen to the soil.

“The idea is to unlock new cover crop supplies,” said Miki Santosa, a graduate student in WSU’s Department of Biological Systems Engineering and corresponding author on the paper. “We don’t want to harm the economics for farmers or hurt the soil, so we looked closely at pain points farmers experience when cover crops are used.”

The project is a joint venture between WSU and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where Santosa is also a chemical engineer.

The team also looked at biofuel potential for each cover crop. That was aided by a new technique called hydrothermal liquefaction, during which the harvested crops, called biomass, are processed into fuel.

“The ultimate goal is to provide refineries and processors with more biomass and renewable feedstocks,” said Santosa, who plans to graduate with a PhD in 2026. “Working with farmers and the agriculture industry to find suitable crops is vital to reaching that goal.”

Currently, any crop used for biofuel has its own specialized process for how biomass is converted into fuel. That makes it difficult to establish a market when, for example, corn undergoes an entirely different process than soybeans. Hydrothermal liquefaction allows processors to mix different types of biomass to produce biofuel.

The study showed that each crop included in the field trials can be processed into biofuels through the liquefaction process.

“If processors can homogenize different materials to make fuel, that lets us think about growing a variety of crops that work well in different areas,” said Chad Kruger, director of WSU’s Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources and a co-author on the paper.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/WSU_Cover_Crop_Nov25_b59a7ae07e.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 16:57:06.836555

McKinsey & Company, a leading global management consultancy, is not only advising clients on how to navigate the complexities of sustainability and climate challenges but is also actively enhancing its own environmental commitments.

By setting stringent, science-aligned targets to reach a net zero future, McKinsey aims to cut emissions, scale climate solutions and drive broader climate initiatives globally.

Incorporating science-based targets

McKinsey has taken robust steps to align its climate strategy with science-based targets, aiming to meet the global climate goals outlined in the Paris Agreement.

The company has set ambitious milestones, the near-term target for 2025, mid-term goals for 2030 and a long-term vision for 2050, focusing on cutting GHG emissions across its global operations.

The commitment is evidenced by the firm’s plans to drastically reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions, with projections to reach a 90% cut by 2050.

“Our 2030 emissions reduction targets have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative, the industry’s most rigorous scientific standard,” writes Alizé Perrot, Environmental Sustainability Specialist at McKinsey, on LinkedIn.

“These targets set a clear path for our rapid, science-aligned progress, which is driven by a three part strategy – cutting emissions, compensating for remaining emissions and catalysing climate action beyond our firm.”

Alongside this effort, McKinsey has achieved early success by surpassing some of its 2025 targets ahead of schedule, showcasing the effectiveness of strategic initiatives like electrifying company vehicles and transitioning to renewable energy sources.

McKinsey has been named 47th in Sustainability Magazine’s Top 250 World’s Most Sustainable Companies 2025.

Addressing Scope 3 emissions

Scope 3 emissions form a significant portion of McKinsey’s carbon footprint, primarily due to business travel.

To tackle this, McKinsey has implemented a series of strategies to alter travel behaviours and influence market conditions, such as introducing a carbon fee on travel and engaging in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) procurement.

Where emissions cannot be entirely eliminated, McKinsey supports certified carbon removal projects.

The firm is committed to shifting its offset strategy to 100% carbon removals by 2030, leveraging both nature-based and technology-driven solutions to address emissions that are more complex to mitigate.

Climate solutions through collaboration

Beyond internal measures, McKinsey uses its influence to foster wider climate action by engaging in collaborative initiatives.

For example, McKinsey plays a pivotal role in projects like the Frontier initiative, providing financial backing for carbon removal technologies, and the LEAF Coalition, which aims to protect forests through large-scale financing.

Similarly, McKinsey has co-founded the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) to promote the scaling of SAF.

These strategic collaborations not only underline McKinsey’s commitment to reducing its footprint but also underscores its role as a significant private-sector catalyst for decarbonisation.

“I’m proud of the team for the hard and continuous work to decarbonise our own operations,” wrote Isabelle Schuhmann, Global Director of Environmental Sustainability at McKinsey, on LinkedIn.

“From fleet electrification, green building certifications, train travel, green hotels and electric taxis to signing long-term offtake agreements for sustainable aviation fuel to help decarbonise our air travel emissions.”

The path forward

The path to a sustainable and climate-conscious future demands coordination among stakeholders across sectors.

McKinsey is aware of this and is investing in sustainability-oriented services to aid clients in their decarbonisation journeys.

The firm's strategy involves supporting clients in understanding and implementing sustainability initiatives and tackling the transition to net zero.

This includes establishing the McKinsey Sustainability platform to equip organisations with the tools and knowledge needed to navigate the complex landscape of ESG challenges effectively.

The potential scale-up of sustainable aviation fuels production capacity to meet global and EU policy targets.","As the world grapples with the urgent necessity to combat climate change, the aviation sector emerges as one of the most challenging industries to decarbonize. Air travel, responsible for a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions, demands innovative solutions that can reconcile the soaring demand for mobility with the imperative to reduce carbon footprints. In this context, sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) have garnered increasing attention as a critical lever to transform the future of flight. A groundbreaking study recently published in Nature Communications by Martulli, Brandt, Allroggen, and colleagues explores the unprecedented potential to massively scale up SAF production capacity to align with both global and European Union climate targets.

The research taps into technological advances, policy frameworks, and economic modeling to investigate pathways through which the production of SAFs could feasibly meet stringent emissions reduction goals laid out for the coming decades. Unlike traditional jet fuels derived from fossil crude, SAFs are produced from renewable sources such as biomass, waste oils, and even synthetic pathways. These fuels offer the promise of dramatically reduced lifecycle carbon emissions—up to 80% less than conventional jet fuel—without necessitating major modifications to existing aircraft engines or infrastructure. However, scaling this industry remains an enormous challenge that intertwines supply chains, feedstock availability, technical hurdles, and regulatory complexities.

Core to the team’s analysis is a techno-economic assessment that incorporates current and projected capacities across various SAF production technologies. The study dissects the landscape into key segments: hydrotreating of vegetable oils and animal fats, pyrolysis and gasification of lignocellulosic biomass, power-to-liquid synthetic fuels utilizing green hydrogen, and emerging bioengineered pathways. By systematically evaluating resource constraints alongside production costs and energy balances, the researchers demonstrate that aggressive investments and policy support could elevate global SAF output to cover up to 50% of jet fuel demand by 2050.

One of the pivotal findings of the paper is the identification of biorefinery hubs optimized for regional feedstock availability, particularly in Europe. The EU’s policy environment, including the Renewable Energy Directive and the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, validates an optimistic scenario where sustainable aviation fuels are deeply embedded in the continent’s energy mix. The study emphasizes that regional cooperation and supply chain integration are instrumental in overcoming feedstock fragmentation—a significant bottleneck for large-scale SAF production. Furthermore, coupling SAF facilities with existing biofuel and chemical plants could create synergies that sharply reduce capital expenditures and operational risks.

Significantly, the research surfaces the critical role of advanced synthetic fuels, created via power-to-liquid routes that convert renewable electricity and captured carbon dioxide into drop-in jet fuels. These fuels, though currently expensive and in early stages of commercialization, have the theoretical advantage of unlimited feedstock potential since they use atmospheric CO2 and green hydrogen derived from wind and solar power. By integrating synthetic SAFs into the broader fuel portfolio, the aviation sector could further decouple itself from biomass limitations and volatile feedstock markets.

The authors also stress the urgency of overcoming economic barriers to widespread SAF adoption. Although operating SAF plants at a massive scale can achieve economies of scale, the initial capital outlays and infrastructure development require robust policy incentives. Carbon pricing mechanisms, blending mandates, and investment subsidies are highlighted as crucial measures to make SAF competitive against conventional jet fuels, which historically benefit from well-established, subsidized fossil fuel supply chains. The forthcoming EU Green Deal and the global alignment under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals provide an enabling backdrop for these policy interventions.

From a lifecycle emissions perspective, the study provides a granular comparison of different production pathways, considering factors such as land use change, water consumption, and indirect emissions. This comprehensive approach is vital for ensuring that SAFs deliver the intended environmental benefits without unintended negative side effects. For example, fuels derived from feedstocks linked to deforestation or intensive agriculture can undermine the sustainability claims of SAFs. Hence, the research underscores stringent sustainability certification schemes as indispensable to maintaining environmental integrity.

An important dimension the study explores is the synergy between SAF production and circular economy principles. Utilizing waste residues from agriculture, forestry, and municipal sources not only offers abundant feedstocks without competing with food production but also mitigates waste disposal issues. Furthermore, by valorizing carbon-rich waste streams, SAF production can function as a carbon sink, contributing to negative emissions in integrated systems. This holistic view aligns with emerging broader climate strategies that encompass carbon management, resource efficiency, and resilient energy systems.

On the technological front, the paper spotlights innovation trends that could tilt the balance in favor of SAFs. Advances in catalytic processes, microorganism engineering, and process intensification hold the promise of improving yield efficiencies, reducing energy inputs, and driving down costs. The integration of digital tools, such as AI-driven process optimization and supply chain analytics, are anticipated to accelerate the maturity of SAF technologies. Furthermore, the research calls for intensified collaboration between academia, industry, and policymakers to fast-track R&D efforts focused on scalable, low-carbon aviation solutions.

A notable policy insight from the study is the balancing act between short-term implementations and long-term strategic visions. While drop-in fuels derived from conventional biomass feedstocks can kickstart SAF deployment today, they may be insufficient for meeting net-zero targets in the mid-century horizon. Therefore, a progressive trajectory that increasingly incorporates synthetic fuels and carbon capture technologies is advocated. This phased approach allows for leveraging existing industrial capacity while incrementally integrating novel technologies as they mature and become commercially viable.

The research also highlights the geopolitical implications surrounding SAF feedstock supply chains. Dependence on certain biomass resources can be geopolitically sensitive, potentially leading to supply insecurities or price volatility. Diversification strategies, including domestic feedstock production and international collaboration frameworks, emerge as critical considerations for building resilient SAF supply chains. European countries, in particular, may need to balance imports with boosting local biomass cultivation and waste utilization to secure sustainable supply while fostering rural economies.

Importantly, the study contextualizes SAFs within broader aviation decarbonization strategies. While SAFs promise significant carbon reductions, they alone cannot achieve the sector’s ambitious climate commitments. Complementary measures, such as aircraft efficiency improvements, operational optimizations, demand management, and the development of electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft for short-haul flights, must proceed in tandem. SAFs thus act as a vital bridge technology facilitating near-to medium-term emissions reductions while the next-generation aircraft technologies advance.

The authors conclude with a compelling narrative of opportunity and responsibility. Mobilizing the capital, political will, and technological creativity required to scale SAF production at a global level is daunting, but feasible. With coordinated action and transparent frameworks, the aviation industry can fundamentally transform its emissions trajectory, securing sustainable skies for future generations. This transformative potential resonates not only for climate mitigation but also for economic innovation, energy security, and environmental justice.

In summary, the groundbreaking analysis by Martulli and colleagues provides a comprehensive and optimistic roadmap for expanding sustainable aviation fuel production capacities aligned with international decarbonization ambitions. It highlights the intertwined roles of technology, policy, economics, and environmental stewardship in shaping the future of flight. As international efforts accelerate towards net-zero emissions, this seminal work crystallizes SAFs as an indispensable pillar in the global climate architecture—a beacon of hope and a call to action for stakeholders worldwide.

The aviation sector is responsible for about 2.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and in the U.S., approximately 98% of aviation-related emissions result from jet fuel combustion.1,2 This highlights the critical role of fuel decarbonization strategies, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) being considered among the more feasible options available for reducing emissions from medium- to long-haul flights.3 Governments in the European Union (EU) and UK are pushing this transformation forward by setting mandates for the progressive use of aviation fuel originating from sustainable materials.4 For example, as of January 1, 2025, commercial flights taking off from EU airports must carry at least 2% of SAF in their tanks. By 2030, the mandate requires a minimum of 6% of SAF, including a 1.2% synthetic aviation fuel (eSAF) blend with conventional jet fuel.5 In addition, many airline members of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) have committed to a 10% reduction by 2030, aiming for net zero by 2050.6

The state of SAF. There are two primary categories of SAF: bio-SAF, derived from biomass and eSAF (also known as synthetic or power-to-liquid SAF), produced by combining green hydrogen (H₂) from water electrolysis with captured carbon dioxide (CO₂). These intermediates can be converted into hydrocarbons through several pathways, including Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, methanol-to-jet (MtJ) and alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) processes. Each route upgrades intermediates into jet-range hydrocarbons through a series of catalytic steps, which may include oligomerization, hydrogenation and hydroprocessing to meet jet fuel specifications.7,8 When produced from waste-based feedstocks, SAF can reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80%–90% compared to conventional jet fuel, depending on the production pathway.9

Today, SAF deployment faces investment barriers. Cost estimates indicate that SAF is 2─10 times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, depending on the feedstock and conversion technology used, largely due to high capital expenditure (CAPEX) for early-stage facilities, limited economies of scale and the expense of green H2 for eSAF pathways.10,11 While SAF is technically mature and scalable, achieving cost competitiveness will require coordinated investment, supportive policy and continued innovation across the value chain.12

Moreover, feedstock availability is limited. The Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) projects global SAF demand could reach 330 MM metric t (MMt)–450 MMt by 2050; however, production is only a fraction of this target.13 For example, Neste (an SAF producer) produces approximately 1.5 MMtpy,14 while Spanish energy company Moeve delivered 14,400 metric t of SAF in 2024 and aims to scale to 800,000 metric tpy by 2030 through a second-generation biofuels plant in Huelva, Spain.15 These figures underscore the scale-up challenge and the need for coordinated policy, investment and technology development to close the gap between capacity and future demand.

While there is a massive SAF market on the rise, the limited availability of waste-based feedstock makes it difficult to meet alternative fuel mandates with bio-based SAF alone. This opens the need for eSAF, made with green H2 and captured biogenic CO2, which is a byproduct of many industrial processes.

In line with the long-term global aspirational goal for international aviation of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and building on the ICAO-adopted Global Framework for SAF and other cleaner energy sources, this statement reinforces the shared European and African commitment to supporting the development, production and deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuels.

The European Union adopted the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation in October 2023 and the African Union adopted a Continental Strategy for SAF in February 2025. The European Union Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), which launched in November 2025, underscores the importance of an EU-Africa co-operation on SAF. Sustainable Aviation Fuels will be the main contributor to aviation decarbonisation, and its development will be a powerful economic catalyst driving the creation of new jobs and economic growth for developing states.

Current production levels of these fuels are still low and there is an urgent need for global action to accelerate the scale up in development, production and deployment of SAF and other cleaner energies, which are produced in a small number of states. Support for SAF and other cleaner energy projects in Africa could play a pivotal role in decentralization of such fuel production across the various regions in Africa, providing an opportunity to participate across the value chain, from feedstock to fuel production and use, therefore achieving common EU and AU objectives in the most efficient way.

In this context, “supporting the development, production and use of SAF in Africa, Latin America/Caribbean and Asia-Pacific” has been designated as a Global Gateway flagship initiative, identifying SAF as a critical priority.

A coordinated and coherent effort by “Team Europe”[1] could help ensure a transformative impact. This is also fully reflected in the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan adopted by the European Commission on November 4th 2025, which recognizes that mutually beneficial international partnerships remain critical to enhance access to markets, helping to secure imports of renewable and low-carbon fuels and feedstock materials, while facilitating the import/export of clean tech in line with the recently adopted ‘Global Europe’ regulation proposal.

The EIB and the EBRD, as Team Europe members, as well as the African Development Bank as a MDB focused on Africa, welcome the opportunity to collaborate with the European Commission and with partner institutions, such as AU and the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), to explore pathways for scaling up development, production and deployment of SAF and other cleaner energies in Africa.

Recognizing a concerted effort involving significant investment, enabling policy and regulatory frameworks and robust technical expertise required to achieve the long-term global aspirational goal, and in light of each MDBs respective mandate and complementarity, the signatories to this statement signal their ambition to:

Engage with stakeholders across the aviation ecosystem to advance the development of SAF and other cleaner energies projects across African continent that are aligned with the global aviation goals, with EU ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation and the AU Continental Strategy for SAF, in line with the operation mandate, policies and procedures for each MDB.

Capitalise on the EU-funded programmes supporting the SAF and other clean energy projects.

Further leverage existing cooperation mechanisms, such as the ""ICAO Assistance, Capacity-building and Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (ACT-SAF) programme""[2] and the “ICAO FINVEST Hub”[3].

This joint statement highlights a collective recognition of Africa's pivotal role in the future of sustainable aviation. By working together, the EIB, EBRD, and AfDB aim to unlock Africa's potential to become a significant contributor to the global SAF and other cleaner energies supply, driving sustainable economic growth and a greener future for the continent.

The government expects that an application for development consent for a Northwest Runway at Heathrow Airport will be brought forward by the promoter of the scheme, the airport operator, Heathrow Airport Limited (HAL), after the review of the Airports National Policy Statement.","A third runway at Heathrow is another step closer to take off by 2035, as the Transport Secretary confirms today (25 November 2025) that Heathrow Airport Limited’s (HAL’s) proposal will be used as the scheme to progress the project.

The proposal will shape the review of the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS), which is the framework within which the planning decision on expansion at the airport will be made, and any amendments to the ANPS will be subject to consultation next summer.

As the UK’s only hub airport, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country, expanding Heathrow will attract international investment, boost Britain’s connectivity, and support economic growth to deliver the Plan for Change. This summer a record 23.4 million passengers travelled via Heathrow, highlighting the level of passenger demand.

After requesting further information last month from the remaining two promoters, the government has assessed that HAL’s proposal offers the most deliverable option and provides the greatest likelihood of meeting the government’s ambition for a decision on a development consent application within this parliament.

Any amendments to the ANPS will be consulted on next summer after the Transport Secretary committed to completing the process 3 years faster than production of the policy statement in 2018. This will provide an important opportunity for businesses, communities, and the wider aviation sector to have their say.

Selection of the scheme to inform the remainder of the review does not represent a final decision on a third runway scheme or design, and any amendments to the ANPS will be subject to consultation and parliamentary scrutiny next year. Exact details such as the length of the third runway, layout, and associated infrastructure implications will continue to be considered throughout the remainder of the ANPS review.

Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander said:

Heathrow is our only hub airport which supports trade, tourism and hundreds of thousands of jobs, underpinning prosperity not only in the South East but across the UK.

Today is another important step to enable a third runway and build on these benefits, setting the direction for the remainder of our work to get the policy framework in place for airport expansion. This will allow a decision on a third runway plan this parliament which meets our key tests including on the environment and economic growth.

We’re acting swiftly and decisively to get this project off the ground so we can realise its transformational potential for passengers, businesses, and our economy sooner.

The government has been clear expansion plans must meet the UK’s legally binding climate obligations alongside balancing delivering economic growth as well as air quality and noise obligations.

The independent Climate Change Committee will be consulted on as part of the review to ensure expansion is consistent with the net zero framework. Today the Transport Secretary has written to the committee requesting advice including on the role of aviation in achieving the UK’s carbon budgets and inviting feedback on proposed updates to the ANPS to ensure alignment with climate commitments.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said:

We’re taking action where previous governments hesitated, and moving forward with Heathrow’s third runway to drive economic growth, international investment and better connections for our country.

That means opening the door to new growth and opportunity with Heathrow expansion – creating over 100,000 jobs, boosting our economy, and giving businesses and communities the certainty they need to thrive.

A swift and robust review of the ANPS was launched last month to consider airport expansion in light of new environmental and climate obligations and sets out the government’s criteria to consider future planning applications.

The selection of HAL’s scheme at this stage follows a rigorous assessment of the promoter’s proposals. This has determined that HAL’s proposal includes expansion plans that are resilient and efficient.

The government expects that an application for development consent for a Northwest Runway at Heathrow Airport will be brought forward by the promoter of the scheme, the airport operator, Heathrow Airport Limited (HAL), after the review of the Airports National Policy Statement.

The government is also pressing ahead with modernising airspace across the UK, to deliver quicker, quieter, and more efficient flights with lower emissions, reducing the sector’s climate change impacts.

The newly published Airspace Design Strategic Objectives will mean that the Greater London airspace block will be given priority in airspace modernisation processes. London’s airspace – which sees over 1.1 million takes offs and landings a year – will be redrawn to ensure the capital’s skies are ready for more departures from a third runway from 2035. This will also benefit passengers after record levels of people flying over the summer, by shortening flight routes and improving resilience in the sector.

A consultation has also been launched on simplifying the Air Navigation Guidance to set clear priorities, save carbon emissions, and ensure that people continue to have a meaningful say on airspace changes that affect them.

Today’s milestone follows the approval of Luton expansion earlier this year and Gatwick expansion last month, as the government continues to back aviation projects that will grow the economy and provide highly skilled jobs.

The government is backing the development of green aviation through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill. This bill will ensure Heathrow contributes to the UK meeting its climate targets by providing economic security for the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market by guaranteeing a set price per unit for UK producers.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-11-25 10:57:00.597804

At the same time, the entire industry is closely watching what the Senate will decide regarding free carry-on and checked baggage on flights in Brazil.

In the third quarter, the three airlines expanded seat capacity while maintaining strong load factors. The favorable supply scenario led to an increase in the average yield (the price paid per passenger to fly one kilometer) across the board. On average, the indicator rose 4.78%, to $0.089.

According to data from the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC), Brazilian domestic aviation reached the mark of 9 million passengers transported in October, up 9.1% year over year. The result sets a record for the month since official records began in 2000. ANAC noted that October’s volume was so strong that it became the fourth-largest monthly total ever recorded in the country—behind only January 2015 and January 2020, both with 9.3 million passengers, and July 2025, also with 9 million travelers.

Latam is currently the market leader, with about 40% of domestic demand in Brazil. The company closed the third quarter with net earnings of $379 million, a 25.8% increase year over year, supported by higher demand as well as fuel that was 11% cheaper. Revenue rose 17.3% to $3.85 billion. Brazil, considering both domestic and international operations, accounts for roughly 50% of the Latam group as a whole.

Carinata cleared for aviation fuel production

Given the third-quarter results and prospects for the final three months of the year, Latam raised its EBITDAR guidance (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or lease costs) from $3.65 billion–$3.85 billion to $4 billion–$4.1 billion.

With strong demand, Latam’s leadership announced new routes for next year. The company expects to operate in 63 domestic destinations in Brazil, compared with 59 today.

Latam Brasil CEO Jerome Cadier said there is room for further growth, noting that the group expects to receive at least 12 Embraer E2 aircraft next year. The routes to be operated with the Brazilian manufacturer’s model should be announced in early 2026.

Another company pushing to expand its flight offering in Brazil is Gol. After completing its Chapter 11 restructuring in the United States, the airline managed to return aircraft to service that had been grounded due to a lack of funds for maintenance. As a result, the company reached an average operational fleet of 119 aircraft in the third quarter, 13 more than in the same period last year.

With more aircraft available, the company transported 8.8 million passengers, up 10.7%. Revenue totaled R$5.5 billion, an 11.6% increase.

The completion of the restructuring led Gol’s debt to fall 21.6%, to R$19.6 billion. Less leveraged, the airline posted net income of R$248 million in the quarter, reversing losses of R$1.42 billion a year earlier.

Azul, which is also undergoing a Chapter 11 process, likewise saw significant gains in its operation. The company closed the quarter with net revenue of R$5.7 billion, up 11.8% year over year.

With its debt weighing on the balance sheet, however, Azul ended the quarter with a net loss of R$1.37 billion, reversing the R$121 million profit recorded a year earlier. The company’s financial result was a negative R$1.9 billion, a 200% increase in losses compared with the same period last year, which contributed to the red ink on the bottom line.

Beyond demand trends, the industry is now closely following discussions in Congress regarding baggage regulations for flights.

On October 28, the Chamber of Deputies (Lower House) approved a bill that prohibits the sale of tickets without a carry-on baggage allowance in Brazil’s domestic market. The opinion from the bill’s rapporteur, Congressman Neto Carletto, mandates free transport of carry-on bags and personal items weighing up to 12 kg on flights.

Lawmakers also approved an amendment reinstating free checked bags of up to 23 kg on both domestic and international flights. The free allowance had been suspended in 2017 and reaffirmed in 2021. The issue is sensitive for the sector, which is awaiting the bill’s next steps in the Senate.

Meanwhile, one opportunity on the horizon is a credit line backed by the National Civil Aviation Fund (FNAC). A total of R$4 billion from the fund will be made available for loans across six financing lines that range from purchasing Brazilian-made aircraft to acquiring domestically produced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

However, airlines argue that under the current terms, the credit line would be impossible for them to access, as they would not meet the requirements set by the government.

In a recent interview with Valor, ANAC president Tiago Faierstein acknowledged that the current rules may limit the industry’s interest. He noted that discussions are underway between the government and airlines to adjust the conditions.",http://s.glbimg.com/en/ho/static/globocom2012/img/fb_marca.png,N,,2025-11-25 12:56:39.337180

Hydrogen is more than a fuel - it’s a strategic energy vector that can decarbonize industries, power transport, and stabilize grids.
Its potential to store energy long-term and enable sustainable fuels like ammonia and aviation fuel makes could make it a key component of the clean energy future.","The physical and net zero characteristics of hydrogen are long-established but figuring out long term use cases, particularly at scale, is the real challenge. Globally, there is huge appetite in many countries and sectors for hydrogen production and development of hydrogen derivatives, such as sustainable aviation fuel and ammonia.

However, the sector suffers from constant and frequently exaggerated comparisons to other energy sectors - including fossil based and clean energy sources. To date, most global sources of energy have benefitted from historic subsidies and, for example, socialised infrastructure costs such as transportation and shipping.

Although the sector is still in its infancy, and nobody disputes the very real physical challenges to large scale deployment, the appetite to develop and integrate coherent national and international use cases for hydrogen is accelerating. This is underpinned by its potential to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors, enable long-term energy storage and create new industrial opportunities.

As governments and businesses race toward net-zero targets, hydrogen offers a versatile solution that could reshape energy systems for decades to come.

Ireland’s Hydrogen Strategy, published in 2023, and the EU’s broader policy framework, including RePowerEU and the Fit for 55 package, both reflect ambitious goals to integrate hydrogen into core energy policy.

Potential applications across sectors

Industrial Decarbonisation

Heavy industries that are difficult to electrify such as steel, cement, and chemicals account for a significant share of global emissions. Hydrogen can replace coal and natural gas in these applications, enabling deep decarbonization without compromising productivity.

Transport and Mobility

Hydrogen fuel cells are gaining traction in heavy-duty transport; trucks, buses, trains, and ships, where battery solutions face limitations in range and weight. Hydrogen-derived synthetic fuels and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) are being developed to reduce emissions in long-haul flights.

Power Generation and Grid Stability

Hydrogen can be used in gas turbines or fuel cells to generate electricity, providing flexible backup power for grids dominated by intermittent renewables.

Data Centres

Data centres account for a significant and growing share of national electricity demand. As a clean, dispatchable energy source, hydrogen can help power data centres while reducing reliance on fossil fuels and easing grid congestion.

Ammonia and Global Trade

Green hydrogen enables low-carbon ammonia production, essential for fertilizers and used as a hydrogen carrier for international transport.

Benefits and Opportunities

Long-Term Storage

One of hydrogen’s most compelling advantages is its ability to store large amounts of energy for extended periods, something batteries arguably cannot achieve economically at scale. Seasonal storage of hydrogen can help balance renewable generation.

Market Momentum

Although hydrogen is still in its early stages, the pace of development is significant:

Global hydrogen projects have surged in recent years, with billions committed to infrastructure and technology.

Governments are introducing subsidies, tax credits, and mandates to accelerate adoption.

Regions with abundant renewable resources, such as the Middle East, Australia, and parts of Europe, are positioning themselves as future hydrogen exporters.

Challenges Ahead

Despite its promise, hydrogen faces hurdles: high production costs, limited infrastructure, and uncertain demand.

Domestically and internationally, the hydrogen sector today mirrors the development of renewables generally in the past, nascent and full of promise yet clear hurdles that need to be overcome.

Crucially, at this stage, there is a far higher acceptance of the core role the energy transition now plays in the Irish economy , particularly across power generation, security and resilience of supply.

Hydrogen is more than a fuel - it’s a strategic energy vector that can decarbonize industries, power transport, and stabilize grids. Its potential to store energy long-term and enable sustainable fuels like ammonia and aviation fuel makes could make it a key component of the clean energy future.

While challenges remain, the growth in projects and investment signals that hydrogen is moving from concept to reality.",https://www.pinsentmasons.com/-/media/images/seo-social-media/editorial-use-only/energy/gettyimages-112635374_digital---seosocialeditorial-image.jpg?rev=7bacb2907bb543c49992dbe6a322cded,N,,2025-11-25 10:57:04.790436

Bell 505 achieves SAF milestone with 700 flight hours

Bell Textron announced at European Rotors 2025 that a single, dedicated Bell 505 has now exceeded 700 flight hours using blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This achievement marks a significant step forward in Bell’s wider sustainability drive and underscores the company’s commitment to accelerating SAF adoption across its flight operations.

Robin Wendling, Managing Director for Europe at Bell, said the milestone reinforces the industry’s broader carbon reduction goals. He noted that Bell’s collaboration with Safran Helicopter Engines has provided a vital advantage in testing and advancing greener aviation technologies.

The partnership began in March 2022, when Bell and Safran Helicopter Engines launched a joint initiative to study the technical performance and economic impact of SAF in the Bell 505, powered by the Arrius 2R engine. Less than a year later, the Bell 505 became the first single-engine helicopter to complete a demonstration flight operating on 100% SAF. Since July 2022, Bell has logged more than 700 flight hours using blended SAF on a single Bell 505 at the Bell Training Academy. Evaluations covering engine operability, aircraft performance, and detailed engine inspections have all delivered strong, positive results.

Jean-François Sauer, Safran Helicopter Engines, EVP Programs, commented, “We are particularly pleased with these SAF flights in partnership with Bell. SAF is key towards more sustainable helicopter use. The Arrius 2R, like all our engines, are currently able to operate with up to 50% drop-in SAF. Very soon, our engines will be capable of 100% drop-in SAF, paving the way for wider use of this type of fuel for increased sustainability of helicopter operations.”

The Bell 505 remains one of the most advanced platforms in its category, combining the Safran Arrius 2R engine with dual-channel FADEC and the Garmin G1000H NXi all-glass avionics suite, complete with moving map display. Its panoramic windows, open cabin design, and Synthetic Vision technology make it a versatile five-seat aircraft suited to public safety, utility work, and military training.

While Australia and China are positioned as potential production powerhouses due to their vast renewable resources and industrial CO2 sources, other key economies face significant infrastructure and resource hurdles.
Renewable electricity: Australia and China lead the way with exceptional solar and wind potential, although renewable electricity demand is rising rapidly.
Most APAC economies remain coal-dependent, limiting near-term renewable surplus for PtX production.
CO2 sources: Industrial CO2 is abundant in China and India, but direct air capture technology remains pre-commercial and prohibitively expensive.","Australia and China hold the strongest industrial and renewable energy foundations to drive the Asia-Pacific's transition to Power-to-X aviation fuels. However, the broader region remains hamstrung by ""uneven readiness"" and policy fragmentation, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials said Nov. 24 in a report.

In its first integrated assessment of the region, titled ""PtX and Sustainable Aviation: A Roadmap for Asia-Pacific,"" the RSB identified a distinct divide in the region's capacity to scale Power-to-Liquids and Power-and-Biomass-to-Liquids fuels.

While Australia and China are positioned as potential production powerhouses due to their vast renewable resources and industrial CO2 sources, other key economies face significant infrastructure and resource hurdles.

Divergent regional roles

The report categorizes the APAC market into distinct clusters, highlighting that no single country currently meets all enabling conditions for rapid deployment.

""Australia and China hold the strongest industrial and energy foundations,"" the RSB said, pointing to Australia's developing coastal hydrogen hubs and China's massive renewable generation capacity as critical assets for the sector.

Advanced economies such as Japan, South Korea, and Singapore were identified as leaders in governance, technology, and trading infrastructure; however, the report warned that they face explicit ""geographic and infrastructure constraints"" regarding raw materials.

Emerging economies such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand offer significant potential for biomass feedstock; however, they are currently limited by water stress, land-use pressures, and fragmented policy landscapes.

Barriers to scale

The RSB warned that the region's diversity creates both opportunities and structural risks. The road map outlined six ""interlinked structural challenges"" preventing PtX from scaling beyond niche projects: policy inconsistency, infrastructure gaps, financing and risk, inconsistent certification systems, and limited stakeholder capacity outside of major industrial economies.

No single country in the APAC region can independently cover all critical dimensions for PtX fuel scale-up, including renewable power, CO2 sources, feedstock supply, industrial capacity, and governance alignment.

Renewable electricity: Australia and China lead the way with exceptional solar and wind potential, although renewable electricity demand is rising rapidly. Most APAC economies remain coal-dependent, limiting near-term renewable surplus for PtX production.

Green hydrogen: Demand for hydrogen offtake agreements is concentrated in Japan, South Korea, and Australia, with China scaling rapidly but lagging in export frameworks. India is emerging as a significant producer of hydrogen, but it faces water stress constraints.

Biomass residues: India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand offer vast potential for agricultural residues — such as rice straw, sugarcane bagasse, palm, and forestry residues — yet their supply chains remain fragmented, and deforestation risks necessitate strict sustainability safeguards.

CO2 sources: Industrial CO2 is abundant in China and India, but direct air capture technology remains pre-commercial and prohibitively expensive. The road map warns that reliance on fossil-derived CO2 poses a ""transition risk"" and undermines the credibility of PtX.

Technology readiness levels:

PtL and PBtL pathways remain at pilot or early-demonstration stage. Current cost estimates are $3,800-8,600/metric tons versus $600-900/mt for fossil jet fuel, a gap wider than HEFA-SAF. The road map projects cost competitiveness only after 2040, as renewable electricity prices decline.

PtL-FT (Power-to-Liquids via Fischer-Tropsch): ASTM D7566 approved, TRL 6-7 (pilot-to-demo)

PBtL-GFT (Power-and-Biomass-to-Liquids): ASTM approved, TRL 6-7 (pilot-to-demo)

PtL-MtJ (Power-to-Methanol-to-Jet): Not yet approved, TRL 5-6 (demo stage)

PBtL-MtJ (Biomass-to-Methanol-to-Jet): Not approved, TRL 5-6 (demo stage)

Strategic road map

To bridge the readiness gap, the RSB called for coordinated regional cooperation rather than isolated national strategies. The road map suggests connecting the resource-rich ""opportunity clusters"" —such as Australia's hydrogen hubs and India's feedstock bases — with the technology and finance centers in Singapore, Japan, and South Korea.

Key recommendations for the next decade include aligning certification systems to facilitate cross-border trade, developing shared infrastructure corridors, and integrating future aviation demand into national renewable energy planning.

""The coming decade will determine whether PtX fuels become a niche innovation or a cornerstone of aviation decarbonization in APAC,"" the report concluded.

Direct SAF blending mandates remain scarce across the APAC region. Only Singapore and South Korea have enacted binding SAF mandates (Singapore: 1% by 2026, rising to 3-5% by 2030; South Korea: 1% from 2027). Japan is consulting on a 10% target by 2030, while China's binding timeline remains undefined.

Drop-in sustainable aviation fuel is one of the few scalable pathways to reduce emissions in an industry where electrification and alternative energy carriers are extraordinarily difficult,” Werner says.
This year in Georgia, LanzaJet became the first to commercially produce jet fuel from ethanol.","The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market is expected to reach nearly $66 billion by 2030 and soar to $655 billion by 2050, and jet fuel tech developers are latching on to waste as feedstock to meet demand. The first innovators have focused largely on agricultural byproducts, but there isn’t enough of the material to satiate airlines’ appetites as they commit to net-zero carbon by 2050. So, some developers are beginning to look at biogas from landfills, wastewater treatment plants, and dairy manure.

The University of Sydney developed a plasma technology to convert landfill gas into SAF. Syzygy Plasmonics says its system can also make SAF from landfill and wastewater biogas, among waste stream byproducts. Now, startup Circularity Fuels is working to make a go in this nascent but growing niche. The Redwood, California, company is beginning with dairy manure.

It seemed like a good pathway due to California’s low carbon-fuel standards (LCFS) incentive program, says Stephen Beaton, a jet fuel scientist turned entrepreneur who launched Circularity Fuels in 2023.

“By converting that gas, we're displacing fossil fuel. But we are also preventing the venting of methane through the atmosphere. So, we get more subsidies and incentives for the fuel,” he says.

Beaton believes SAF can open a lot more opportunities for the renewable natural gas (RNG) industry at a time when existing markets, mainly fuel for bus and truck fleet operators, are becoming increasingly saturated. Some developers are having a harder time getting their products into the few states that dole out incentives for RNG as transportation fuel.

“We can take advantage of many of the same subsidies, credits, and corporate programs by producing fuel for aviation in a market that is almost infinitely scalable,” Beaton says.

Still, there is more biogas worldwide than all the fuel-hungry airlines combined require. So the feedstock exists. The key to scaling is more a matter of developing technology and equipment that are affordable to deploy, which takes time.

In an earlier day, Beaton worked on novel fuels for the Air Force, then at the Pentagon, standing up the Air Force's synthetic aviation program. He has since spent years trying to figure out how to make jet fuel at scale and cheaper than has been done to date. Something a little different about Circularity’s model is that the company owns both primary steps of the process that follow anaerobic digestion: making the fuel precursor, syngas, then converting that syngas into jet fuel.

Verticalizing the technology stack to be able to perform the whole process in-house is generating cost and energy efficiencies, as is the technology itself. The system, which uses a modified automotive catalytic converter, is more compact and cheaper to run than traditional methane reforming equipment. Not having to filter out the carbon dioxide (CO2) from the waste stream helps.

“We actually use the CO2 in the process, which allows us to make more syngas per unit of biogas. And by combining the methane and CO2, the syngas is naturally at the ratio required for liquid fuel production [bypassing additional steps],” Beaton says.

While Beaton focuses on finetuning the first on-farm demo, he is thinking ahead, talking with landfills, feedlots, and wastewater treatment plants as well as biogas and RNG developers who are looking for outlets for their gas. On the offtake side, the young company so far has nondisclosure agreements with about half a dozen airlines. Optimizing is a slow-going process as there are some fundamental but complex principles to prove out.

Today’s pilot produces about a gallon of jet fuel a day. The plan is to scale to 100 million gallons per year by the mid-2030s. That would fuel roughly 10,000 transatlantic flights – about 35 million miles of long-haul air travel, Beaton says. So far, he and his team have secured about $9.5 million in seed funding and grants from venture capital firms, the National Science Foundation, California Energy Commission, and others.

The primary funder, DCVC, brought the startup into its entrepreneur-in-residence program, which backs “deep tech” developers aiming to transform underused or low-grade resources into valued products at scale. Producing fuels from waste fits squarely with that focus, says Milo Werner, a partner at DCVC focused on climate.

“Aviation is a natural priority because it is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. Drop-in sustainable aviation fuel is one of the few scalable pathways to reduce emissions in an industry where electrification and alternative energy carriers are extraordinarily difficult,” Werner says.

What stood out about Beaton and his team is that they found a way to avoid costly pre-treatment steps and infrastructure barriers that limit traditional reforming technologies (there is no need for a connection to a pipeline).

“Their approach has potential to bring down the cost of SAF production by an order of magnitude. That combination of technical advantage, cost disruption, and applicability to a hard-to-abate sector made Circularity a compelling investment,” Werner says.

Countries around the world are providing incentives and/or implementing SAF mandates to take these emerging technologies further. And these policies are driving demand. Commercial airlines are leaning in to figure out how to secure SAF years in advance of production. Right now, what product is available to them comes with sticker shock. Compared to the roughly $2.50 per gallon cost of traditional jet diesel, airlines pay $7 or $8 per gallon for clean fuels. Renewables that do not come from crop waste, and therefore don’t compete with food production, cost more. Making it more affordable is a work in progress.

Other issues are tough competition for the more widely used feedstocks (ag byproducts) and the availability of energy as companies compete for this resource too. Then there is regulatory uncertainty, particularly in the U.S., where the landscape has shifted.

While the Inflation Reduction Act created a $1.75 a gallon credit for SAF, that figure recently dropped to $1 per gallon. Now several members of Congress have introduced bills aiming to bolster incentives. Airlines can still tap into RINS credits through the U.S. EPA. Though key programs once offered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture have stalled, with uncertainty over whether they will reopen.

But slowly, a few domestic SAF projects are coming online and scaling up, with a handful more slated to launch soon. This year in Georgia, LanzaJet became the first to commercially produce jet fuel from ethanol. In Texas, Diamond Green Diesel is making SAF from used cooking oil and animal byproducts; with an annual capacity of 70 million tons, the corporation is reportedly the world’s largest producer of waste-based jet fuel.

But airlines will need 500 million tons of SAF a year to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association. As far as Beaton’s contribution, admittedly, he says, if he meets his aspired targets, he alone will only make a dent. Though he is an optimist. He sees potential for healthy growth ahead in a budding industry.

“California scaled quickly from a very small percentage of compressed natural gas to essentially having 100% of vehicles run on biogas today. We think that scale can exist [for SAF].”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt4a147f9e36f0754a/blt88dcb6ad44d503e5/69248db04df136c21f6aaf99/jet_fuel_2_1540.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-25 08:56:38.204099

The collaboration aims to explore pathways for developing economically feasible SAF production and supply infrastructure in Dubai, with ENOC evaluating its potential contribution to local production. A joint steering committee will guide the evaluation.

As a safe and fully certified drop-in fuel compatible with existing aircraft fleet and airport infrastructure, SAF can be blended with conventional jet fuel at a ratio of up to 50%, creating an aviation fuel that is significantly lower in lifecycle carbon emissions. In its neat form, SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.*

Emirates is actively engaged in advancing the UAE's sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem through membership in the Technical Group under the Aviation Fuels Executive Committee, convened by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, and the Dubai Biofuels, Hydrogen and Sustainable Aviation Fuel Committee, established by the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy.

The airline has contributed to the UAE's General Policy for Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which aims to transform the UAE into a regional hub for alternative aviation fuels with production targets of 700 million litres by 2030. Additionally, Emirates and the UAE GCAA have played key roles in developing the UAE's power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels roadmap, driven by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure and the World Economic Forum.

Emirates also spearheaded SAF demonstration flights on its Boeing 777 and A380 aircraft. In January 2023, the airline operated a Boeing 777 flight using 100% SAF in one engine, and in November 2023 conducted the first A380 demonstration flight using 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its four engines.

This recognition celebrates the Foundation’s dedication and success in generating positive outcomes through its pioneering sustainable procurement tools and standards.

The GBTA Foundation’s work to embed sustainability into an industry with $1.57 trillion in purchasing power culminated in 2024 with the release of the GBTA Sustainable Procurement Standards, which enable corporate travel buyers to consistently assess suppliers’ sustainability efforts. Developed in collaboration with GBTA Sustainability Partners and Sustainability Committee, the standards were vetted by more than 50 companies (buying organizations and travel suppliers like airlines, hotels, and car rental companies), as well as standard setters such as the International Air Transport Association, Travalyst and the World Sustainable Hospitality Alliance.

In the latest GBTA Sustainability Acceleration Challenge global benchmark, announced on November 10, 38% of companies say they consider climate criteria in supplier selection, and in 2026, the GBTA Foundation will be releasing a suite of practical tools to aid in their analysis. This will include case studies and scorecard templates which will allow buyers to make sustainable and data-driven decisions in procurement.

We’re proud to be recognized by SPLC, a respected leader in sustainable procurement. This recognition reinforces our conviction that strong collaboration across the travel supply chain can lead to meaningful transformation. Sustainable procurement is no longer optional—it’s becoming the foundation for how responsible businesses operate, and we’re excited to help drive that shift.

Under the partnership, Landmark Group will adopt DHL’s GoGreen Plus programme to reduce Scope 3 emissions across its international shipments using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The Group operates more than 2,200 retail stores across 21 countries and employs over 50,000 people, giving the agreement wide regional impact.

GoGreen Plus shifts away from traditional carbon-offsetting models by replacing fossil-based jet fuel with SAF produced from renewable feedstocks.

Each tonne of SAF used can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 80%, with reductions independently verified and certified by SGS for full accountability.

SAF deployment brings measurable reductions

The agreement was formalised in Dubai by Mahmoud Haj Hussein, Country Manager of DHL Express UAE, and Rajesh Garg, Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Sustainability Officer at Landmark Group.

Haj Hussein said that “DHL has committed to investing €7 billion globally in climate-neutral logistics by 2030, and partnerships like this demonstrate how we’re translating that ambition into measurable action,”

Adding, “Landmark Group’s decision to adopt GoGreen Plus reflects how progressive enterprises are keen on moving the industry toward a net-zero future.”

Garg said the partnership embeds sustainability deeper into the Group’s regional logistics footprint. “Our partnership with DHL marks an important step in reducing our Scope 3 emissions and advancing our decarbonisation goals through credible solutions like Sustainable Aviation Fuel.”

Alignment with UAE Net Zero 2050

The collaboration supports the UAE’s national Net Zero 2050 strategy, which positions the country as a global leader in climate action and sustainable economic development.

Beyond sustainability, Subhas urged governments to take a more active role in strengthening the region’s aviation supply chain.","The Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) has described Singapore’s upcoming sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy as an important push to encourage greater production and use of cleaner fuels in aviation, reports New Straits Times.

AAPA director general Subhas Menon said the levy is designed to motivate action, noting that travellers often express support for sustainability but do not always follow through.

He said many passengers claim they are willing to contribute to sustainability efforts, including supporting SAF, but often “words and actions do not match,” and the levy acts as the needed reminder.

According to him, most travellers are unlikely to object to paying between S$1 and S$41—depending on destination and travel class—because the money supports a meaningful cause.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore announced on November 10 that the SAF levy will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing Singapore from October 1, 2026. Charges will vary by distance and cabin class.

Subhas said Singapore has also assured the public that their contributions will be used properly. The levy will go directly toward the purchase of SAF, managed by the newly established Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Co Ltd. (SAFCo), which will handle procurement on behalf of the country.

He described Singapore’s model as a combination of firm government commitment and public willingness to support sustainability.

While the levy has drawn widespread attention, Subhas said it is unlikely that other Asia-Pacific countries will adopt a similar approach, as each government has different needs and policy structures.

“There is no one-size-fits-all,” he said, noting that countries are taking different pathways to increase SAF use.

Japan, for instance, is pursuing a public–private partnership model supported by its large supply of used cooking oil, creating new income opportunities for communities involved in collecting and processing it.

Malaysia, he added, has also laid out long-term plans to build domestic SAF production capacity, targeting significant output by 2050.

Subhas said most Asia-Pacific countries already have policies and regulations in place to expand SAF use, with the region now showing much faster progress than two years ago. He said these efforts are expected to lead to at least five percent SAF usage across the region.

Beyond sustainability, Subhas urged governments to take a more active role in strengthening the region’s aviation supply chain. He said airlines have repeatedly been called upon to push the sector forward, but governments also need to recognise aviation as a long-term economic opportunity worthy of investment.

He said governments can help local companies become regional suppliers of aircraft components—similar to efforts underway in China—and support investments in maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities and the broader aviation aftermarket.

On rising concerns over passengers carrying lithium-ion batteries, Subhas said airlines face challenges because different countries follow different rules, causing confusion among travellers.

He noted that some airlines believe no action is needed, while others want clearer guidelines. However, he stressed that regulators—not airlines—should issue the necessary rules.

He added that if regulators do not act, the association is willing to propose recommendations based on established safety procedures.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-14.png,N,,2025-11-25 08:58:46.100604

The initiative is expected to reduce emissions by up to 90%, supporting PIL’s long-term sustainability goals, reports Business Today.

Sriram Iyer, Chief Operating Officer of PIL, said SAF offers strong potential to advance climate targets while meeting the needs of air freight. He noted that as the push toward net-zero gains speed, renewable fuels provide a clear route to reducing emissions and the partnership with DHL reflects PIL’s commitment to greener operations and better carbon performance.

PIL, a global player in the edible oil and consumer goods industry, already manages its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions according to the GHG Protocol. By joining GoGreen Plus, it is also addressing Scope 3 emissions, which include indirect emissions from supply chain activities.

Sustainable aviation fuel, produced from materials such as used cooking oil and other waste, can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. DHL’s GoGreen Plus programme uses a book-and-claim model, allowing the environmental benefits of SAF to be credited to customers even when their shipments are not physically transported using SAF.

Julian Neo, Managing Director of DHL Express Malaysia and Brunei, said the company is pleased to have Pacific Inter-Link join the programme and help build wider acceptance of SAF as an important tool for lowering aviation emissions.

He added that both companies are taking key steps to scale the technology and speed up the shift toward solutions that can cut emissions across logistics operations, while continuing efforts to improve SAF production, supply and availability.

According to Phillipp Minarelli, Nufarm Brasil’s carinata manager, the strong results reflect the profile of the producers selected for this first commercial cycle.
“We often say it’s not the producer who chooses carinata, it’s carinata that chooses the producer,” he said.
In October, the facility conducted a test crush of 2,500 tonnes of carinata, producing both oil and meal.
Unlike canola oil, carinata oil is toxic for human consumption, requiring chemical treatment to remove harmful compounds.","Carinata, a close relative of canola and one of the most promising feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), delivered strong results in its first year of commercial trials in Brazil. With harvesting completed in recent weeks, yields easily surpassed initial projections, paving the way for rapid expansion.

Commercial planting covered 100,000 hectares under agreements between farmers and Australia’s Nufarm, which supplied the seeds. The company also secured firm offtake contracts with BP, which uses carinata oil at its SAF biorefineries in Europe.

In Mato Grosso do Sul, which led national planting with 10,000 hectares and has nearly finished its harvest, average yields reached 30 bags per hectare. Although one of the lowest averages among producing states, the result was well above Nufarm’s initial national estimate of 20 to 25 bags per hectare.

Carinata was planted in eight states. All Cerrado areas performed above expectations. In Mato Grosso, yields ranged from 30 to 35 bags per hectare, while in Goiás they averaged 33. Paraná posted roughly 37 bags per hectare. Harvesting is still underway in Rio Grande do Sul, the country’s second-largest producer with 7,500 hectares.

According to Phillipp Minarelli, Nufarm Brasil’s carinata manager, the strong results reflect the profile of the producers selected for this first commercial cycle. “We often say it’s not the producer who chooses carinata, it’s carinata that chooses the producer,” he said. The crop is well suited as a cover crop, planted after soybeans and corn as part of soil-conservation practices typically adopted by farmers with more advanced management systems. “These are farmers who already work to keep soil covered and take care when planting,” he said.

So far, all harvests have comfortably exceeded the breakeven point of 15 to 18 bags per hectare, Minarelli said. Compared with other potential SAF feedstocks, carinata has both lower production costs and a smaller carbon footprint. On average, each megajoule of energy produced from carinata-based SAF emits 14 grams of CO₂, compared with 68 grams from soybean-oil-based SAF, he said. The low carbon intensity will likely boost demand from aviation, a sector facing binding decarbonization targets starting in 2027.

One factor that makes carinata more sustainable than soy is its lower need for nitrogen fertilizers, the largest source of agricultural emissions. “Some farmers in Paraná applied no nitrogen at all and will still harvest 30 bags,” Minarelli said.

Carinata also generates abundant crop residue and has deep roots that improve soil aeration, benefiting the following summer soybean crop. “It makes soybean planting easier, with less diesel consumption and less soil compaction,” he said. And because it belongs to a different botanical family than oilseeds and cereals, carinata helps break pest and disease cycles in grain-producing areas, potentially reducing pesticide use.

There are advantages on the industrial side as well. Carinata seeds contain 38% to 45% oil, roughly twice the oil yield of soybeans.

The crop also stands out among winter alternatives for its resilience to extreme weather. Native to Ethiopia, carinata tolerates temperatures above 30°C and withstands frost. That resilience proved critical this year, when some winter fields endured four frost events and remained intact, while crops like wheat and sugarcane suffered yield losses.

Nufarm aims to double its planted area in Brazil by 2026 through expanded partnerships with producers.

Oil

Last year, when Nufarm conducted pilot trials, the harvested carinata had to be shipped to Belgium for processing. This season, carinata grown in Brazil will be processed domestically at a canola-crushing facility opened this year by Celena Alimentos and Grupo Camera in São Luiz Gonzaga, Rio Grande do Sul. With that, Brazil will begin exporting carinata oil.

In October, the facility conducted a test crush of 2,500 tonnes of carinata, producing both oil and meal. Unlike canola oil, carinata oil is toxic for human consumption, requiring chemical treatment to remove harmful compounds.

Laboratory analyses have already confirmed that carinata meal contains adequate protein levels for feed use. Additional testing is expected to certify the removal of toxic elements, according to Vantuir Scarantti, agricultural manager at Celena Alimentos.

Once meal viability is fully confirmed, the plant is expected to process carinata for one month each year, crushing 20,000 tonnes, while canola will be processed during the remaining 11 months. As domestic output expands, the facility could extend carinata crushing time, either by reducing canola throughput or increasing overall capacity, Scarantti said.

In the coming years, Nufarm expects Brazil’s planned SAF plants to internalize the entire production chain. By 2030, SAF production is slated to begin at the Refinaria de Petróleo Riograndense (RPR) in Rio Grande (Rio Grande do Sul), at Petrobras’s refinery in Cubatão (São Paulo), and at an OilGroup facility under development in Bacabeira (Maranhão).

Use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Primarily, SAF is the industry’s current favorite.

Now, it is about responsibility too. Also, the sky is more complex than it looks. Essentially, every flight leaves a carbon footprint that sticks around for decades.

Also, sustainability is no longer a trend. Rather, it is a necessity. Moreover, airlines are under pressure, governments are setting targets, and passengers are asking questions.

Now, the conversation has shifted from “Is it possible fly cheaper?” to “It is possible to fly cleaner?” That shift is reshaping the entire industry.

Major Environmental Challenges in Air Travel

At the outset, the truth is hard to ignore. In fact, aviation contributes roughly 2-3% of global carbon emissions. Interestingly, that number is climbing.

It is not just CO₂ but even nitrogen oxides, contrails, and water vapor that amplify the warming effect. Also, the sector’s growth exacerbates this. More planes, more routes, more fuel burned.

Unlike cars, planes cannot just switch to electric overnight. The physics of flight make decarbonization a tough nut to crack. And while other industries have clear roadmaps, aviation’s path is full of technical and financial hurdles.

Major Reasons Why Carbon-Neutral Flights Are Necessary?

Presently, airlines are trying to clean up their act. Carbon offset programs are everywhere now. You book a ticket, and they promise to plant trees or fund renewable projects. Although it sounds good, critics still call it a band-aid solution.

In fact, offsets do not eliminate emissions. Rather, they just compensate for them. Still, it is a good start as some carriers are pledging to reach net zero by 2050. Although it is ambitious, it is actually the sole option left.

International Regulations and Agreements: What Are They Doing?

Global rules matter here. For instance, agreements like CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) aim to cap emissions growth. As a result, the following happens:

Countries sign up

Airlines comply

Basically, the idea is to keep aviation from spiraling out of control.

However, enforcement is still complicated. This is because every nation does not play fair, and loopholes exist. Meanwhile, regulations have the capability to bring in innovation. Also, they slow things down if they are too rigid. In fact, it is a balancing act of progress versus practicality.

Innovations Driving Change

This is where things get interesting. Essentially, technology is rewriting the future. Also, engineers are chasing ideas that sounded like science fiction a decade ago.

1. Electric and Hybrid Aircraft Technology

Nowadays, electric planes are no longer mere sketches. In fact, companies like Eviation and Airbus are testing prototypes for short-haul flights. Moreover, batteries are the bottleneck because they are too heavy and still lack sufficient energy density.

Meanwhile, hybrids come with a compromise, as they combine conventional engines with electric systems to reduce fuel consumption. This is how progress actually happens. For example, imagine boarding a plane that hums instead of roars. That is the dream for many.

2. Use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Primarily, SAF is the industry’s current favorite. It is made from waste oils, biomass, and even algae. Also, it can slash lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. Moreover, airlines are blending SAF with traditional jet fuel, and airports are slowly adapting.

However, cost is a major factor here. SAF is expensive, and scaling production is a headache. But if you’ve ever wondered how these innovations work and thought, “write my assignment on sustainable aviation,” you are not alone—this topic is gaining academic interest.

3. Fuel Efficiency Is Possible Through AI and Data Analytics

Obviously, AI is not merely for chatbots. In fact, airlines work with predictive analytics to optimize flight paths, reduce drag, and save fuel.

Moreover, real-time data crunching means fewer wasted miles and smarter maintenance schedules. However, passengers do not see it, but the impact is real. These come in the form of:

Lower emissions

Lower costs

Fewer delays

Although this is invisible innovation, it still matters in the long run.

Challenges and Opportunities

No one talks about how expensive going green is. That is why airlines operate on thin margins. Also, new tech demands big investments. Hence, passengers might feel the pinch too. Moreover, ticket prices could rise as carriers absorb costs. This is because infrastructure is another hurdle.

In addition, airports require charging stations for electric planes, storage for SAF, and systems to handle new logistics. However, there are many opportunities. In fact, if you are an early adopter, you will be able to grab market share. Also, governments will come up with jobs in green tech. As a result, the planet gets a breather.

The following are some of the major friction points in sustainable aviation:

Cost implications. SAF and electric tech are not cheap.

Infrastructure readiness. Airports require major upgrades.

Regulatory complexity: It is difficult to work in compliance with global standards.

Even though there are many challenges, the upside is clear. Basically, cleaner skies mean a stronger brand image for airlines and better compliance with climate goals. Also, you will have a future where flying does not feel like an environmental crime.

Closing Thoughts

Now, sustainable aviation is no longer a dream. Rather, it has become a necessity. Of course, the industry is slowly but surely pivoting toward a future. Hence, flying does not mean frying the planet.

Moreover, expect tech to lead the charge. However, collaboration is necessary between airlines, regulators, and passengers. These factors will actually seal the deal. Although the skies might look the same, the engines powering them will tell a different story.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pexels-karabo-photo-294956252-16510280-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 17:57:30.255123

An interinstitutional project led by UdeA has reached a significant milestone in innovation for the country's energy transition. This project involves developing a prototype to produce biojet fuel, a sustainable alternative meant to replace petroleum-based fuel in airplanes. It is derived from palm oil, which produces one liter of biofuel daily. As a pioneer in Colombia, the project is currently being tested on real microturbines, which paves the way for more sustainable aviation.

Each gallon of this fossil fuel emits nearly 10 kg of CO₂ into the atmosphere. Biojet can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 90% during its life cycle. Photo: Communications Department/ Alejandra Uribe F.

What began as an academic effort has become a collaborative project in which the university, industry, and the state share a common goal: to produce sustainable aviation fuel in Colombia. Today, there is a prototype that delivers one liter of biojet per day, and while it may seem like a drop in the ocean, it holds the promise of transforming the way the country thinks about its energy.

The project, which has been underway since 2022, is led by the Industrial Chemical Processes (PQI) research group with support from the Efficient Energy Management (GIMEL) group attached to UdeA’s Faculty of Engineering. Universidad de La Guajira, Fedepalma, and IEA Instruments also collaborated on the project. The Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation provided financial backing.

Biojet, or Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), is the most promising alternative available to the airline industry today for reducing its carbon footprint. Unlike Jet A-1, which is derived from petroleum, it can be produced from renewable raw materials such as vegetable, animal, or waste oils.

Its use does not require changing engines or infrastructure, and although it currently represents less than 5% of global consumption, organizations such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) point to it as key to the sector's meeting its environmental goals.

This development is crucial for a country like Colombia, which, under the Paris Agreement, pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by 2030.

This is a significant challenge considering that ""Colombia consumes between 550 and 600 million gallons of fossil fuel per year, so adopting SAF is not a luxury, but a strategic necessity,"" said Major Mauricio López, strategic specialist for aeronautical development at the Autoridad Aeronáutica de Aviación del Estado. He also confirmed that the Colombian Air Force (FAC) alone consumes about 10 million gallons of Jet A-1 per year. According to Clean Fuels Alliance America, by 2022, global aviation consumption reached 99 billion gallons.

""The biojet we produce is derived from palm oil, but we are not alone. There are much more robust research groups and powers worldwide working on these biofuels. Even so, there are still technological challenges to overcome, especially in production costs, which are currently higher than their fossil counterparts. The challenge is to develop technology that reduces these costs and enables a viable substitution of conventional fuels,"" said Luis Alberto Ríos, professor at UdeA’s Faculty of Engineering and director of the PQI group.

The history of this development at UdeA began with the first biodiesel projects the GIMEL group conducted in the early 2000s and the oleochemical research that the PQI group consolidated in 2012. This trajectory led to an inter-institutional project, which aims to leverage technology to produce renewable diesel for ground vehicles and biojet for the aviation sector. This would reduce dependence on foreign patents and lay the foundations for a true energy transition.

From palm trees to sky, this is how UdeAbiojet is made

In the face of global criticism of palm oil as a cause of deforestation, researchers emphasize that the Colombian case is different. ""Our industry here has not developed by clearing natural forests,"" Professor Ríos asserted.

The process begins with palm oil, a raw material chosen for its availability in Colombia. According to Fedepalma, the country is currently the fourth-largest producer globally and the largest on the continent. ""We proved that palm oil has the greatest benefits for combustion of the oils tested,"" commented John Ramiro Agudelo, PhD in thermal sciences and researcher in the GIMEL group at UdeA’s Faculty of Engineering.

The first product, renewable or green diesel, is produced through a hydrotreatment process that involves ""cleaning"" the oil with hydrogen to remove unwanted oxygen. It has already been successfully tested in road vehicles in collaboration with industry partners.

This renewable diesel then enters a second process known as isomerization, during which the molecules are reshaped to better resist cold conditions. ""It's the final step that functions like a molecular antifreeze,"" Professor Agudelo explained. ""We altered its structure to guarantee the fuel remains fluid at high altitudes, where temperatures can drop to -50°C, to ensure it complies with strict aviation standards for biojet fuel.""

The scaled-up prototype, currently located at the University Research Headquarters (SIU), is a system of tubular reactors, high-pressure pumps, and feed tanks in which oil and hydrogen react. At maximum capacity, it can produce up to 30 liters per day. It has reached Technological Readiness Level 7 (TRL 7*) on a scale of 1 to 9.

It was designed and built with the company IEA Instruments, owned by UdeA graduates. It features a catalyst that, in Professor Rios's words, ""does the magic, since it allows the reactions to occur."" This technology has been validated under real-world conditions and could be ready for commercial implementation.

A next leap: starting the engines

The GIMEL group is responsible for the fuel's final validation. Its laboratories evaluate the mixtures' performance using a real aviation microturbine, similar to those found in commercial airplanes. ""We are the first university in Colombia to test a locally produced biojet on this type of equipment,"" said Professor Agudelo.

The tests will begin with gradual blends based on a key industry fact: It is currently not feasible to operate aircraft exclusively on sustainable fuel due to strict engine requirements. Therefore, combinations will initially be evaluated in which, for every 100 liters, between 1 and 5 liters of biojet will be included —mixtures of 1%, 2%, and 5%— maintaining conventional Jet A-1 as the base.

The goal is to measure engine behavior and emissions with each increment accurately, and to this end, the researchers include doctoral students to support this process. ""Unregulated emissions, which have a high impact on human health, are analyzed,"" Agudelo added. He emphasized that, if funding continues, the goal is to improve the quality of the biojet obtained, increase the blend percentages, and scale up production for testing on real aircraft engines.

According to the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, the cost of air pollution in Colombia —associated with sources such as transportation, industry, waste management, and the burning of fossil fuels— is estimated at $11.7 billion annually, primarily due to premature mortality and hospital care. Faced with this multisectoral impact, Professor Agudelo emphasized that ""human health cannot be balanced in economic terms,"" and highlighted that initiatives such as biojet production represent concrete progress in reducing the pollution from aviation, one of the sectors most involved in this problem.

For Laura Orozco, co-investigator of the project, the prototype is a tangible result of the UdeA innovation ecosystem. ""What we see here is how the knowledge generated in the laboratory can transcend to generate technology-based companies and provide concrete solutions for the country.""

While this milestone highlights the development of technologies in the University, the next scaling phase will be crucial to turning this scientific achievement into a viable alternative on the market. However, the risk of repeating what happened with biodiesel two decades ago remains: Importing technology to adapt plants while neglecting local knowledge. ""We need continuity, greater funding, and a clear policy that allows academia and industry to work together. The question is not whether we will produce biojet, but whether we will do so with technological sovereignty,"" warned researcher Ríos.

For his part, Major López agreed that the challenge is not only technical but also concerns public policy. ""SAF must be on par with other existing biofuels. To achieve this, Colombia must support the implementation of the first biorefineries and assist investors, with academia as a strategic partner to mitigate the risks in this initial stage.""

In this validation phase, the FAC is emerging as a key ally. ""With our capabilities, we can support academia with test benches, extensive engine testing, and technical verifications that guarantee flight safety with alternative fuels,"" said López. He added that the international standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) require approximately 450 cycles to certify the inclusion of a new SAF.

The social impact is also at stake. Researchers propose partnership models in which rural communities can participate in the value chain, considering the country's high availability of raw materials. ""It's not just about decarbonizing the sky, but also dignifying the land,"" Ríos insisted.

The goal is clear: Transforming the country's agricultural wealth into energy value, thus creating local supply chains that benefit everyone, from small farmers to international airlines. It's not just about replacing fuel but building a new economy around it in the country, as other nations have been doing.

The final message is an invitation not to repeat past mistakes. ""We can import turnkey technology once the world has already solved the problem, or we can be part of the solution by developing our capacity, knowledge, and industry,"" Agudelo concluded.

Careful! They are not the same! Biodiesel, renewable diesel, and biojet

Biodiesel: Produced through a transesterification reaction, which transforms oil into an ester chemical compound. It is already commercially available in Colombia mixed with fossil diesel currently at 10%.

Renewable diesel (green diesel): The result of hydrotreatment. It is a hydrocarbon identical to fossil diesel but of plant or animal origin. It is the first product of the UdeA prototype.

Biojet/SAF: Renewable diesel that undergoes an isomerization process to meet strict aviation requirements, such as a low freezing point. This is the final product.

We appreciate the tireless work of Chairman Graves and the members of the committee to address aging infrastructure and gaps in the current NAS, as well as provide investments to ensure the FAA’s workforce is able to attract and retain top-tier talent.”

Skyryse, Howard Kass, Vice President, Government Affairs: “Thank you for your unwavering commitment to ensuring the safety of our nation’s aviation system. I write today to convey our support for the U.S. House of Representatives reconciliation package to address air traffic staffing, infrastructure, and technology issues, etc…At Skyryse, we are solely dedicated to advancing aviation safety, and we stand ready to work with the Committee to ensure the United States remains the gold standard of safe air travel.”

Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council), Karen Kerrigan, President and Chief Executive Officer: “SBE Council commends the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for advancing a reconciliation proposal that includes funding for critical investments to modernize our nation’s air traffic control (ATC) system. A reliable ATC system is vital to U.S. commerce and competitiveness, providing essential support to small businesses that depend on a well-functioning airspace for efficient travel, cargo transport, and timely delivery of goods…We urge Congress to enhance U.S. airspace efficiency, support small business competitiveness, and secure America’s position as a global leader in aviation by passing this package as part of its One Big, Beautiful reconciliation bill.”

Southwest Airlines, Christa Lucas, Vice President, Governmental Affairs: “On behalf of Southwest Airlines, I write in strong support for the Air Traffic Control (ATC) funding proposal that is slated to be included in the Budget Reconciliation Act. We applaud your leadership in attempting to address critical needs at the FAA and the agency’s ability to properly manage the largest, most complex, and most important ATC system in the world – while at the same time maintaining our nation’s ‘gold standard’ in terms of aviation safety.”

Thales, David Scruggs, Vice President, Government Relations: “Thales commends the Committee for their recognition of the funding issues that continue to affect air traffic staffing, infrastructure and technology. This initial proposed tranche of funding, along with the identified first set of priorities, are a much needed down payment on accelerating modernization. It is essential that, as a nation, we focus on restoring the infrastructure of the NAS to its proper state – reflective of what we all agree is required to remain the safest air space in the world.”

Truckload Carriers Association (TCA), Dave Heller, Senior Vice President of Safety and Government Affairs: “The TCA and its membership favor a fee for all Hybrid and Electric Vehicle Users. We have consistently backed efforts such as Senator Deb Fischer’s (R-NE) ‘Stop EV Freeloading Act,’ now known as the ‘Fair SHARE Act,’ and we are equally supportive of the House companion bill championed by Representative Dusty Johnson (R-SD-At Large)...TCA looks forward to collaborating with the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in any way we can to support a strong and sustainable future for our highway system.”

U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Rodney Davis, Senior Vice President, Government Affairs: “As your committee advances the budget reconciliation process, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce commends you for exploring opportunities to restore the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) as the primary mechanism financing critical surface transportation projects through targeted ‘user fees’...Modernizing the current user fee system to reflect the realities of rising construction costs, permitting delays, inflation, increasing fuel efficiency, and the growing number of electric vehicles can help ensure all users contribute meaningfully to our nation’s highway system.”

U.S. Travel Association: “U.S. Travel strongly supports the Air Traffic Control modernization proposal the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure put forth to fund critical investments in air traffic control technology, infrastructure, and workforce…We urge Congress to include this much needed ATC funding in the final Budget Reconciliation measure.”

United Airlines, J. Scott Kirby, Chief Executive Officer: “We greatly appreciate President Trump and Transportation Secretary Duffy’s leadership in highlighting the need to address ATC staffing, provide long-term funding for facilities, and modernize the technology used by controllers. The funding that you are proposing will serve as a critical down payment and significant first step towards the Trump Administration’s strategic plan to comprehensively improve the ATC system.”

Assessments of engine operability and aircraft performance as well as engine inspections have yielded positive results to date.

Jean-François Sauer, Safran Helicopter Engines, EVP Programs, commented, “We are particularly pleased with these SAF flights in partnership with Bell. SAF is key towards more sustainable helicopter use. The Arrius 2R, like all our engines, are currently able to operate with up to 50 percent drop-in SAF. Very soon, our engines will be capable of 100% drop-in SAF, paving the way for wider use of this type of fuel for increased sustainability of helicopter operations.”

Combining its Safran Arrius 2R engine, dual channel FADEC, and Garmin G1000H NXi all-glass avionics suite with a moving map display – the Bell 505 is one of the most technologically advanced platforms in its class.

The added benefit of wide panoramic windows, open cabin design, and Synthetic Vision technology has classified this five-seater aircraft as a platform for a variety of missions, including public safety, utility, and military training.

On Saturday, climate negotiations wrapped up in Brazil with a weakened agreement. The agreement avoided any direct reference to phasing out fossil fuels, a win for oil producers and oil-producing nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia. Despite dire scientific warnings about the need to transition from coal, oil, and gas, the final text offered up no concrete commitments and diluted warnings about the cost of inaction. Many countries, including 80 that were pushing for a fossil-fuel phaseout plan, expressed deep disappointment and frustration. Colombian diplomat Daniela Durán González said, “This is the COP of truth. The truth cannot support an outcome that ignores the science.” The lack of meaningful progress further highlighted the disparity between wealthy emitters and vulnerable nations.

G20 summit in South Africa wraps, despite US absence

This weekend, G20 leaders met in Johannesburg, South Africa, for the 2025 G20 Leaders’ Summit. Leaders from the world’s largest economies met in Africa for the first time, and for the first time without the United States in attendance. The Trump administration refused to attend, citing false claims that the South African government was allowing for the killing of white Afrikaners and seizing white-owned land. Despite the U.S. absence, South African Minister of International Relations Ronald Lamola declared the event a success. The G20 issued a joint declaration at the start of the summit rather than at the conclusion. The declaration emphasized gender equality, debt relief for poorer nations, and climate action. President Cyril Ramaphosa closed the summit without the traditional handover, as the U.S. will be the next president of the G20 summit.

Singapore’s Sembcorp plans IPO in India

After a failed IPO attempt in 2019, Sembcorp, a state-owned energy company based in Singapore, is considering a second attempt at an initial public offering for its Indian unit in Mumbai. The corporation has appointed three investment banks, including HSBC and Citi, to aid in the talks. With an increase in listings, Indian markets are currently trading near record highs. Firms have raised over $16 billion in 2025, establishing India as the third-largest IPO market in the world. Sembcorp’s India unit reached revenues of $252 million in the year ending March 31, 2024. Of that revenue, over $40 million was profit. The company hopes to launch the IPO in eight to nine months.

Hi, my name is Chris Woodruff from the Managing Director of Manchester Airport. We've just had a great sustainable aviation discussion roundtable today. Andy Burnham's been here and we've been sharing the plans for getting on top of net zero in aviation. So it's clear the Northwest of England has an opportunity here in that we have a collection of assets that if brought together could make us a a world leader in this territory. The Northwest can be a real force. In decarbonising aviation, in developing South, in developing the the aircraft and the infrastructure needed to decarbonise aviation. And what I've proposed today is that we convene the political leaders of the wider NW and indeed North Wales to see if we can all come together and realize the opportunity that might be before us. It is a big challenge. It's really hard, but there are some great ideas. If we really put our minds to it, I'm sure we can get there.

“Black carbon is one of the longest, unresolved issues running at the IMO, and must now be dealt with without delay”, said Prior.
“The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has spent more than a decade on scientific analysis and discussions, but black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping remain unregulated.
About Black Carbon, Polar Fuels, and the Arctic Black carbon is a short-lived climate pollutant, produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, with an impact more than sixteen hundred times that of CO2 over a 20 year period.
The need to reduce emissions of black carbon because of both the climate and health impacts has been long recognised.","Following the closing of the COP30 climate summit this weekend, the Clean Arctic Alliance criticised the lack of action on fossil fuels, and failure to harness potential quick victories from cutting black carbon and other short-lived climate forcers.

“COP30 promised so much - it’s disappointing that it delivered so little”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor, of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “There was a clear lack of urgency amongst governments, in the face of the climate crisis, with a complete dearth of official COP30 attention to easy wins on short-lived climate forcers - like black carbon.”

“However, with less than a fortnight to go for governments to submit a plan for cutting a plan for cutting black carbon emissions from shipping in the Arctic, International Maritime Organization member states - led by Arctic governments - must now respond to the high-level announcement made by several governments - including Canada - at COP30 on sectoral action to tackle black carbon emissions from commercial and residential energy and transport sources”, added Prior.

“These countries clearly recognise the need for urgent action on a potent, short-lived superpollutant where action now could make a real difference in mitigating the impact of climate change and also improve air quality and public health for communities in the Arctic”, said Prior.

“Addressing black carbon offers a unique opportunity to advance climate change mitigation, build climate resilience, improve air quality, safeguard public health, and deliver

sustainable development co-benefits”, said the statement by Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Madagascar, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Uganda.

Governments need to urgently act ahead of the December 5th deadline for proposals on polar fuels, ahead of a meeting of the IMO’s Pollution Prevention and Response committee (PPR 13) in February 2026 in London that will set rules on what fuels can be used in the immediate future by shipping in the Arctic.

Momentum towards these polar fuels is building: the Nordic Council of Ministers recently recommended that Nordic governments work towards the recognition of polar fuels by the IMO and the MARPOL Convention. Now, during COP30, governments have again recognised the need for urgent action on a potent, short-lived superpollutant where action now could make a real difference in mitigating the impact of climate change and also improve air quality and public health for communities in the Arctic.

“As this announcement from COP30 shows, the world is starting to take urgent action on black carbon emissions - we need Arctic governments to take action ahead of the IMO’s December 5th deadline, in order to dramatically reduce black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor, of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “By making cleaner fuels (polar fuels) mandatory for shipping in this unique region that is already being dramatically affected by climate change, Arctic governments - and other IMO member states - have a unique opportunity to demonstrate joint leadership on this issue”.

“Black carbon is one of the longest, unresolved issues running at the IMO, and must now be dealt with without delay”, said Prior. “The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has spent more than a decade on scientific analysis and discussions, but black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping remain unregulated. The next opportunity comes in February 2026, when the IMO’s Sub-Committee on Pollution Prevention and Response will meet (PPR 13) to discuss polar fuels.”

“A strong agreement on polar fuels to set rules which will reduce black carbon emission levels from shipping in the Arctic region is essential”, added Prior. “The deadline for submitting proposals is December 5th - and we want to see a concrete proposal led by Arctic states, including Canada, Norway, Iceland, Denmark/Greenland, on polar fuels that will ensure a rapid reduction in Arctic black carbon emissions, ahead of longer-term decarbonisation efforts.”

A regulation requiring the use of polar fuels in the Arctic must set the foundation in MARPOL Annex VI (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) for reductions in emissions which reduce the impact of black carbon on the Arctic.

A recent report by NGO Pacific Environment lays out the case for why the International Maritime Organization (IMO) should immediately act on reducing black carbon pollution — a climate super-pollutant. On Thin Ice: Why Black Carbon Demands Urgent Action, explores how the expansion of Arctic shipping is causing an increase in the release of black carbon into the air, which then settles on snow and ice, accelerating dangerous melting. Switching to readily available and cleaner “polar fuels” — such as marine distillates DMA and DMZ or new fuels with comparable black carbon emissions levels — will rapidly cut emissions, protect vulnerable ecosystems and safeguard communities.

About Black Carbon, Polar Fuels, and the Arctic

Black carbon is a short-lived climate pollutant, produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, with an impact more than sixteen hundred times that of CO2 over a 20 year period. It makes up around one-fifth of international shipping’s climate impact. Not only does it contribute to warming while in the atmosphere, black carbon accelerates melting if deposited onto snow and ice – hence it has a disproportionate impact when released in and near to the Arctic.

The melting snow and ice exposes darker areas of land and water and these dark patches then absorb further heat from the sun and the reflective capacity of the planet’s polar ice caps is severely reduced. More heat in the polar systems – results in increased melting. This is the loss of the albedo effect.

Declines in sea ice extent and volume are leading to a burgeoning social and environmental crisis in the Arctic, while cascading changes are impacting global climate and ocean circulation. Scientists have high confidence that processes are nearing points beyond which rapid and irreversible changes on the scale of multiple human generations are possible. Scientists say it is now too late to save summer Arctic sea ice, and research has shown that “preparations need to be made for the increased extreme weather across the northern hemisphere that is likely to occur as a result.”

Black carbon also has a negative impact on human health including premature death and harmful effects on the cardiovascular system (heart, blood and blood vessels), and recent research has found black carbon particles in the body tissues of foetuses, following inhalation by pregnant mothers.

The need to reduce emissions of black carbon because of both the climate and health impacts has been long recognised. On land, considerable effort has been made to ban dirtier fuels in power stations, to install diesel particulate filters on land-based transport, and to improve the burning of dry wood – all to reduce emissions of black carbon and improve air quality. However, at sea the same efforts have not yet been made.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Clean_Arctic_Alliance_COP30.png,N,,2025-11-24 10:56:48.084731

From Baghdad to Vilnius

Founded by the late Dame Zaha Hadid, the Iraqi-British architect who became the first woman to win the prestigious Pritzker Prize, the firm has maintained its reputation for pushing architectural boundaries since her death in 2016.

ZHA-designed airports tend to feel more like art installations than transit hubs, with sweeping curves and dramatic spaces that have redefined what travelers expect from modern terminals.

For Vilnius, this represents a major upgrade to aviation infrastructure in the Baltics. The Lithuanian capital has seen passenger numbers steadily climb as it positions itself as a regional hub, and the new terminal will address growing capacity needs while aiming to create a memorable experience for visitors.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/11/Render-of-new-VNO-Airport-terminal.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 12:56:49.233079

The demonstration uses Greenlyte’s fully electric, modular LiquidSolar system, which captures CO2, produces green hydrogen, converts both into syngas, and synthesises this into e-fuels such as synthetic natural gas, e-methanol, or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at “fossil-competitive costs.”

As a proof-of-concept facility, the company expects to produce up to five tonnes of synthetic natural gas (SNG) whilst also capturing 40 tonnes of CO2 per year.

Greenlyte says the plant went from engineering to inauguration in under 12 months, with final construction completed in less than three, supported by more than 13,000 hours of pilot operation.

The German start-up added that it can scale the system to much larger commercial plants.

Greenlyte is planning a larger e-methanol facility in Marl, Germany, by 2027, and wants to expand its operations internationally by 2030.

Long-term offtake agreements have also reportedly been signed with Eurowings and MB Energy, although the firm has not disclosed volumes or timelines.

Florian Hildebrand, CEO and co-founder of Greenlyte, claimed the LiquidSolar technology is “economically attractive for customers,” and offers “strong return opportunities for investors.”

The CEO added, “We are building the foundation for a competitive new energy industry by drawing on North Rhine-Westphalia’s industrial legacy, a world-class research ecosystem, and a dense supplier network – making optimal use of the great resources we have here.”

The region’s Minister President, Hendrik Wüst, said North Rhine-Westphalia aims to become “Europe’s first climate-neutral industrial region.”

With Uniper as an associated partner, the initiative received funding from the EU and the German state.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are pivotal for decarbonizing aviation, but how are they certified to be a ""drop-in"" replacement for conventional Jet-A fuel without requiring any modifications to aircraft or engines? It's a rigorous process ensuring uncompromising safety and performance!

The ""drop-in"" capability is essential for rapid adoption, allowing SAF to be blended with conventional jet fuel and used in existing infrastructure and aircraft without costly overhauls. This is achieved through strict certification standards, primarily governed by organizations like ASTM International (ASTM D7566 and D1655).

The certification process involves:

Feedstock to Fuel Pathway: Each SAF production pathway (e.g., HEFA from used cooking oil, alcohol-to-jet) is evaluated, ensuring it meets strict sustainability criteria (e.g., reduced lifecycle CO2 emissions, no competition with food crops).

Chemical Equivalence: The produced SAF must be chemically identical or functionally equivalent to conventional Jet-A fuel. This means matching key properties like:

Energy Content: To ensure equivalent range and thrust.

Freezing Point: Critical for high-altitude operations.

Flash Point: For safe handling and storage.

Density & Viscosity: For proper fuel system and engine operation.

Thermal Stability: To prevent coking in hot engine sections.

Engine & Component Testing: Extensive testing is conducted on engines and fuel system components, both in labs and in flight, using SAF blends (often up to 50% currently, with 100% SAF certification pathways emerging). This verifies performance, compatibility, and durability.

Blends Only (Currently): While 100% SAF flights are being tested, most certified SAF today is approved for blending with conventional jet fuel up to a certain percentage, after which the blended fuel meets the Jet-A specification.",https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/588982037_850049210905747_7474270926916849976_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_tt6&cstp=mx1080x1080&ctp=s600x600&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=cae128&_nc_ohc=52TleUN4QcsQ7kNvwHQg3Z7&_nc_oc=Admzkxyx02AYY3-ibV29fDzq4u7aJ8h4OxoupKpN5_8RDf4lJx7fSWIuqTlYtv1yai2H3skACmDNwErKmx0M80f9&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&_nc_gid=H16TwybtO48HOG6vrxxZSQ&oh=00_AfhDORVE9eRJn3kR-L69mAhNsb1WrOwtIEJuYNuzoQWCpw&oe=692A5BF0,N,,2025-11-24 12:56:54.238684

In a move aimed at standardising and accelerating environmental progress across the industry, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) has launched its new Integrated Sustainability Program (ISP), a certification framework designed to provide airlines with a comprehensive, auditable approach to sustainability management. The programme provides carriers with a structured pathway to evaluate their environmental performance, track improvements and demonstrate compliance with emerging global sustainability requirements. Earlier this year, the International Air Cargo Association (Tiaca) released the latest edition of its annual Air Cargo Sustainability Insights Report, offering one of the sector’s most extensive assessments of current sustainability practices. Drawing on input from 274 industry respondents, the report highlights a marked increase in commitment to decarbonisation, transparency and operational innovation across the air cargo value chain. Central to the industry’s net- zero pathway is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is expected to deliver around 65% of aviation’s total emissions- reduction target by 2050. Yet SAF remains scarce. Currently, it accounts for only about 1% of global jet-kerosene production, with supply constraints and limited availability posing major hurdles. The EU’s 2% minimum SAF- use mandate, which will rise annually, has already highlighted the gap between policy ambition and production reality. Despite the relatively low starting threshold, many carriers are struggling to secure volumes, underscoring the need for far greater government support, including tax incentives, to stimulate investment in new production capacity. Current SAF prices remain roughly three times higher than conventional Jet A1, adding further pressure to scale supply. Earlier this month, the European Commission released its Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) that aims to address some of these long-standing weaknesses in the aviation decarbonisation strategy. Iata welcomed the Commission’s recognition of market challenges that derive from SAF mandates that were flawed from the outset, particularly the price gap between sustainable and conventional fuels, and the need for robust investment support. According to Willie Walsh, Iata director general, the airline industry is committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but this ambition can only be realised if policy frameworks are fully aligned with industry needs and the true scale of the challenge. Industry experts Freight News spoke to said ESG was increasingly being recognised as good for the planet and for business. Sustainability-based strategic growth plans are becoming the norm, with customers, employees, partners, financial institutions and regulators all insisting on stronger environmental and governance practices. Government requirements for increased reporting for public companies over a certain size are also beginning to take effect. In the short term, these are forcing companies to invest in the systems needed to monitor and report on their sustainability performance.

Twenty-five years ago, Jurong Island showed the world what Singapore could achieve when we dared to think big and work together.","Introduction

1. Good evening, everyone. It is heartwarming to see all of you gathered here tonight – from the pioneers who laid the foundations of Jurong Island, to the many partners working here over the years to realise our vision.

2. Tonight, we celebrate not just an anniversary, but a remarkable journey – one that reflects Singapore’s spirit of imagination, partnership, and long-term planning.

From Vision to Reality

3. Twenty-five years ago, Jurong Island began as a bold idea: to create a thriving, integrated hub for energy and chemicals from seven small southern islands.

a. Some wondered whether it would work – whether we could build the infrastructure, attract investors, and create an ecosystem from scratch.

b. But our pioneers believed in our vision. They saw that with clarity of purpose, perseverance, and trust between government and industry, this island could anchor a new engine of Singapore’s industrial growth.

4. That belief paid off. From its early days, Jurong Island brought together companies that started that vision and continued to believe in us.

a. Singapore Refining Company continued refining on Pulau Merlimau even before reclamation began.

b. PCS started Southeast Asia’s first naphtha cracker in 1984, laying the foundations for the downstream petrochemical ecosystem.

c. ExxonMobil, whose predecessor Esso operated a refinery on Pulau Ayer Chawan in the 1960s, built a world-class petrochemical plant here in 2001, and expanded in 2007 and again in 2013, making Singapore its largest manufacturing site globally.

d. These early movers paved the way for others. We have since attracted over 100 global energy and chemicals companies, including Advario, Afton, Asahi Kasei, Evonik and Vopak.

5. Today, Jurong Island is recognised globally as a trusted hub for energy and chemicals. It sits at the heart of an integrated ecosystem that spans the entire petrochemical value chain – from refining and cracking, to petrochemicals and specialty chemicals.

a. This tightly knit ecosystem, with over 100km of pipelines, allows companies to operate efficiently and export reliably to the region and beyond. In fact, Singapore ranks as the world’s 3rd largest oil trading hub, 6th largest refinery export hub, and 9th largest chemicals hub.

b. It is also home to cutting-edge industrial infrastructure, and a thriving environment for innovation and applied research.

6. Our energy and chemicals sector accounts for around 3% of Singapore’s GDP and about one-quarter of manufacturing output in 2024. It provides employment for more than 27,000 workers, including in emerging roles such as industrial biotech, carbon and energy management, and decarbonisation technologies.

a. We owe this success to many of you here this evening – including Philip Yeo, former Chairman of EDB, our industry leaders, our engineers, our workers – who believed in Singapore and helped turn Jurong Island from an idea into reality.

Transforming Jurong Island

7. Even as we celebrate this achievement, we must look ahead. The global energy and chemicals industry, once built around scale and cost-efficiency, is being reshaped by new technologies, the pressure to decarbonise, and rising demand for higher-quality and greener products.

8. Jurong Island must therefore reinvent itself to stay competitive and relevant.

9. Last month, at the Singapore International Energy Week, we outlined the refreshed direction for Jurong Island – to become a premier hub for specialty chemicals and sustainable materials, and a global testbed for new energies and low-carbon technologies.

The Next Chapter of Jurong Island

10. First, specialty chemicals and sustainable materials.

a. Regional demand for higher-quality products in markets such as consumer goods, pharmaceuticals, and electronics is driving the growth in specialty chemicals. This has fuelled the recent entry of new players such as Arkema, Cariflex and Kuraray.

b. Sustainability goals worldwide are also driving demand for products such as bio-based polymers, low-carbon coatings, and green solvents, and in turn drive new investments into sustainable materials.

c. At the same time, existing players are also investing in efforts to reduce their carbon footprint.

i. For example, Aster and Air Liquide have signed an MOU to produce low-carbon hydrogen. This will be integrated with Aster’s cracker furnaces and waste heat recovery systems, and can enable Aster to reduce its carbon emissions.

d. I am glad to note that we are making good progress towards our Sustainable Jurong Island target.

i. The sector’s output of sustainable products has grown 1.4 times since 2019, and we are on track to reach a 1.5-times increase by 2030.

ii. Singapore’s refineries and crackers now rank within the top half of global energy efficiency, and are working toward top quartile performance.

iii. Together, these efforts will transform Jurong Island to stay competitive in a low-carbon future.

11. Another new area of opportunity is in New Energies. We are seeing good progress in the growth of New Energies on Jurong Island.

a. Sembcorp Solar operates the island’s largest solar deployment of close to 120 MWp.

b. IHI Corporation and A*STAR have launched a bench-scale SAF rig, producing sustainable aviation fuel from hydrogen and CO₂.

c. EMA and MPA have appointed a Keppel-led consortium to explore low- or zero-carbon ammonia solutions for power generation and bunkering.

12. Building on this momentum, JTC and Keppel have signed an MOU and will partner with EMA to study the pilot deployment of a microgrid testbed on Jurong Island. This initiative will advance the integration of renewable energy, battery storage systems and smart grid technologies.

13. These efforts will bolster Jurong Island’s proposition as a living testbed for the development of future-ready energy solutions.

14. Last but not least, we will also leverage Jurong Island to drive innovation into low-carbon technologies. In 2027, A*STAR will open its S$62 million Low Carbon Technology Translational Testbed (LCT³) on Jurong Island, providing a modular platform to pilot emerging low-carbon solutions.

a. ISCE² and Surbana Jurong have signed an MOU to pilot and deploy novel low carbon technologies in the LCT³ environment with local and international partners.

15. To further accelerate the piloting and deployment of low-carbon solutions on Jurong Island, JTC will partner Rocky Mountain Institute’s global climate-tech accelerator Third Derivative (D3).

a. This partnership will connect companies on Jurong Island with D3’s global network of over 280 start-ups and solution providers to develop new clean energy solutions.

16. We will also leverage the new power generation capacity on Jurong Island over the next few years to anchor the next generation of power-intensive digital infrastructure.

a. We have set aside about 20 hectares for Singapore’s largest low-carbon Data Centre (DC) Park. This will be able to support up to 700 MW of AI and other DC capacity while meeting stringent efficiency and cooling requirements.

b. To support this development, JTC and NUS have signed an MOU to study the establishment of a Sustainable Tropical Data Centre Testbed 2.0.

i. Through this facility, DC operators will be able to test their low carbon solutions and develop large-scale, water- and energy-efficient systems on Jurong Island.

17. Together, these efforts will create a comprehensive ecosystem at Jurong Island where ideas can be tested, refined, and scaled, enabling Singapore to contribute meaningfully to global decarbonisation.

Transforming our People

18. But transformation is not just about technology. It is also about people. As Jurong Island evolves, we must prepare our workforce for new opportunities in sustainable manufacturing, clean energy and advanced industrial systems.

a. I am glad to note that as part of their MOU, JTC and NUS will work together to cultivate a skilled talent pipeline that supports industrial decarbonisation and sustainable digital infrastructure projects on Jurong Island.

b. In tandem, Advario is working with Workforce Singapore to upskill their workforce with capabilities to support its energy transition, with an estimated 150 personnel benefitting from this partnership.

c. I hope more companies will also take the opportunity and initiative to redesign jobs and upskill their workforce as they transform their product mix. This will strengthen our talent base to support the island’s transformation, and ensure that our people will be ready to seize the opportunities ahead.

Conclusion

19. Twenty-five years ago, Jurong Island showed the world what Singapore could achieve when we dared to think big and work together. Today, as the world enters a new energy era, Jurong Island once again stands ready – to lead in sustainable chemicals, to pioneer new energies, and to develop the low-carbon technologies that will power the industries of the future.

20. As we celebrate 25 years of Jurong Island, let us honour the pioneers who laid the foundation, the workers who keep the island running safely every day, and the innovators who are charting its next frontier. And let us continue working together – government, industry, academia – to ensure that Jurong Island remains not only a hub for the world’s energy and chemicals, but also a beacon of low-carbon innovation for the future.

21. Thank you, and congratulations once again to everyone who has been part of Jurong Island’s extraordinary journey.",https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/166/e1d58d67-6d17-4eaa-a59f-e6201b2d360a/MTI%20Logo.png,N,,2025-11-24 11:56:46.348953

He breaks down the agriculture investing landscape into two worlds: mergers and acquisitions of existing, cash-flow positive and tech-enabled ag businesses and early-stage startups likely to seek venture capital.
“It has, I think, caused investors to pull back in the early stage venture ecosystem of agtech,” he says.
“You have something that’s immediately asynchronous with the funding mechanism of venture capital, but it doesn’t mean it’s not investable and that VC doesn’t work,” he says.
“Just because it works in the lab, doesn’t mean you have a product,” Hedges says.","St. Louis’ agricultural prowess has long given it a leg up in growing or attracting companies working to develop the next big breakthrough in that industry. Yet traditional venture capital isn’t always suited for the rhythms of agriculture–making agtech startups’ success more complicated than buzzier bets on technology or artificial intelligence innovation.

Despite tough odds, startups tied to St. Louis have managed to break through this year, including the gene-editing related startup Spearhead Bio, which raised more than $1 million; Plastomics, also in the genetic modification space, secured close to $6 million in a Series B round; and the soil-testing startup TerraBlaster netted close to $4 million in its pre-seed round. And on the other end CoverCress Inc., is finally nearing its big push to market, marking a payoff for Bayer, which has backed the company for a decade.

Analysts say there is room for more investment.

“The ag space is one that has a significant amount of opportunity that is underserved from a global investment perspective,” says Scott Porter, managing director at Cascadia Capital, where he leads the mid-market investment bank’s food and agribusiness sector.

Porter says agriculture makes up approximately four percent of the global gross domestic product, one quarter of the employed workforce globally, and eight percent of global trade, but only accounts for roughly two percent of mergers and acquisitions and capital markets activities. He adds it has an asset class that he describes as “counter cyclical,” whereby it tends to outperform the overall market when there’s a downturn.

“As the opportunity in agriculture has become clear, as the market has become more educated on [that] opportunity, there’s more interest that has come into the market, and I believe more interest and liquidity will continue to come,” Porter says.

He breaks down the agriculture investing landscape into two worlds: mergers and acquisitions of existing, cash-flow positive and tech-enabled ag businesses and early-stage startups likely to seek venture capital. The former is attracting quite a bit of attention from private equity firms, Porter explains, while investment activity the latter has cooled a bit since earlier this decade when low-interest capital created buzz, but also overinflated valuations.

“It has, I think, caused investors to pull back in the early stage venture ecosystem of agtech,” he says.

TerraBlaster CEO Jorge Heraud is no stranger to raising capital in tougher environments, having done so in 2009 for his previous company, Blue River Technologies, which eventually exited to John Deere for $305 million. He says economic conditions now present a similar challenge. Today’s low commodity prices for farmers can translate into fundraising challenges for companies developing innovative products targeting the farm market.

“It’s not the best and easiest of fundraising times in agriculture, because when the farmer economy is poor, then the big companies start retrenching, and then also investors start retrenching a little bit,” Heraud says.

Heraud says TerraBlaster has managed to break through because the device the company is developing will eventually provide real-time data about soil composition to farmers, circumventing time-consuming and costly soil-testing techniques.

The idea is that more granular information on soil health, water conditions, and other factors will help farmers make better decisions about fertilizing and lead to greater yields.

“Farmers are super interested in being more efficient and more conscious about profit. Part of our big part of our value proposition is that we can help the profitability of a farmer,” he says. “It’s an investment not an expenditure.”

TerraBlaster intends for its first device to enter the market near the end of 2026. That’s a faster development timeline than some other agtech innovations because the company is focused on automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence, which don’t need approvals from government regulators, says Porter. Developing something related to a crops’ genetic traits or a new biological product can take well over a decade, he says.

“It’s critically important that investors understand these timelines, the road map, the capital need, so that they know what they’re getting into ahead of time, and they can better underwrite to the milestones that are to come,” Porter says. “Some of our challenges are, in part, investors not fully appreciating that timeline, and therefore having misaligned expectations relative to the commercialization timeline and the capital necessary.”

Traditional venture capital funds tend to be held to 10-year return cycles, whereas the standard crop technology or crop protection technology can take anywhere from 10 to 13 years to get to market, says PJ Amini, senior director of venture investments with Bayer’s strategic investment unit called Leaps.

“You have something that’s immediately asynchronous with the funding mechanism of venture capital, but it doesn’t mean it’s not investable and that VC doesn’t work,” he says. “These things are still venture investable from the right lens and the understanding of the technology, the regulatory landscape, and the time.”

Leaps operates differently than a traditional venture fund. While Amini does cut checks to support early-stage technology and business models related to Bayer’s main verticals of agriculture, pharmaceutical, and consumer health products, the goal lingering in the background is Bayer eventually being able to partner with the companies it invests in, whether that’s by going to market together, licensing, or completing an acquisition.

The St. Louis-based startup CoverCress Inc. offers a prime example. Starting in 2013, the company has sought to alter pennycress, an unwanted weed on farmers’ fields, into a commercially viable crop whose seeds could be crushed for their oil and refined into a form of sustainable aviation fuel. Critically, it grows over winter and is harvested in spring, creating a revenue stream outside of the main cash crop season.

“Utilizing that land to grow another crop is really paramount to not only CoverCress’ success, but I think for the farmer as they try to kind of reimagine how they can drive more revenues,” says CoverCress CEO Jim Hedges.

Monsanto was an early investor in CoverCress, a stake Bayer maintained after its acquisition of the crop science company in 2018. In 2022, Bayer took a majority 65 percent ownership position in CoverCress with the remaining 35 percent split between Chevron U.S.A. Inc. and Bunge.

“We saw this as something that was good for the soil, good for biofuel production, good for the farmers’ economics, and was doing some element of nitrogen fixation as well,” Amini says.

What Amini calls a “moonshot if we could develop this” in CoverCress is finally nearing its long-awaited commercialization ramp-up almost 15 years since the company formed. CoverCress’ product is on about 13,000 acres this year, which Hedges projects will grow to 100,000 over the next three to four years. (For comparison, there are roughly 135 million acres of corn and soy grown across the Midwest and Great Plains, according to the 2022 Ag Census.)

“We’re getting growers acclimated to it. We’re building the right agency network. We’re getting our regulatory freedom to operate,” he says. “From a technical standpoint, we’re ready to go from a product, which is really a luxury.”

There are a variety of reasons it’s taken this long for CoverCress to get ready to scale. Hedges says the company needed time to get into a position where it could extract the “true value” from the crop that comes from crushing its seeds and processing their oil into the aviation fuel alternative.

There are also regulatory approvals. Since CoverCress’ product is gene edited, the company needed an FDA approval recognizing the crop as generally safe for poultry feed, Hedges says. Plus, the crop isn’t on chemical labels yet, limiting where it can be planted for now, he adds.

It also took time to learn how the plant behaves and the best management practices for it over multiple growing seasons, Hedges says. Without that information, it’s too risky for a new company to scale quickly, he adds.

“Just because it works in the lab, doesn’t mean you have a product,” Hedges says.

Out in “the true proving grounds” of farm fields, there’s no control over rain, temperature, humidity, light intensity, fertility and many other growing conditions, he says. Even with innovations like the device TerraBlaster is developing outside of crop science, the rugged farming landscape still presents its challenges.

“[Our sensor is mounted] behind a tractor that’s moving and there’s dust [that] gets created, there’s unevenness in the soil,” says Heraud. “It creates all sorts of little and big challenges we’re having to solve one by one.”

The company spent the fall gathering soil-testing data in Iowa and will take the winter to analyze it, before going out to capture more testing data with the equipment before planting season and after harvest next year.

“We’re going to be working on real-time measurements [then], as opposed to just capturing spectrum [from this fall],” Heraud says. “It’s going to be two bites at the apple to conquer that.”

Crop-focused innovations don’t enjoy such a fast iteration cycle. Artificial intelligence tools are becoming powerful enough to shave years off the early development timeline for a new crop or biological product, says Amini, but “I still need to grow a plant, test it, see how that does. And I’m limited by the timeliness of the physical world.”

Adds Hedges: “Once you get out into the field, [it’s] one iteration a year. So it’s going to take patient capital.” And St. Louis does have firms willing to make such long-term bets, such as Lewis & Clark’s Agrifood fund, Cultivation Capital and The Yield Lab, and BioGenerator Ventures.

Both Hedges and Heraud say this reality in the ag sector places importance on startups developing or leaning into partnerships with bigger strategic players. In the case of CoverCress, its split ownership between Bayer, Bunge, and Chevron takes care of each piece of the supply chain for the company’s crop, from seeds and distribution to farmers, to crushing to the eventual end users.

“It’s all complementary,” says Hedges. “Trying to vertically integrate all this [at CoverCress], we would never raise enough money, and we would never have enough time. We don’t want to recreate or duplicate what already exists.”",https://www.stlmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/plant-scientist_GettyImages-2196741236.webp,N,,2025-11-24 11:56:49.817535

• The loss and damage fund moves into a regular replenishment cycle, backed by new implementation tools and monitoring frameworks.

• Brazil’s presidency committed to develop two new roadmaps on deforestation and fossil fuel transition after negotiators failed to secure explicit phase-out language in the final text.

High expectations, difficult compromises

COP30 closed at sunrise on Saturday after a marathon final night of negotiations, delivering a substantial climate-finance package and new implementation mechanisms, but stopping short of a formal commitment to phase out fossil fuels.

UN climate chief Simon Stiell described the outcome as evidence that “194 nations stood together, keeping humanity in the fight for a livable planet, determined to hold the line at 1.5°C.” Even so, tensions ran high over what many delegations viewed as an incomplete energy outcome, with explicit phase-out language removed in the final hours.

The adopted decision reaffirms the UAE Consensus from COP28, calling for “transitioning away from fossil fuels,” but negotiators from South America, the EU and civil society groups said the omission of a roadmap remained a point of concern.

The finance package: scale and structure

The final outcome commits Parties to mobilising at least $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 for mitigation, adaptation and resilience. Adaptation finance is set to double by 2025 and triple by 2035, a long-standing demand of climate-vulnerable countries. The loss and damage fund, launched at COP28, now enters an operational and replenishment cycle.

The summit also launched the Global Implementation Accelerator and the Belém Mission to 1.5°C. Both aim to support national climate action plans and improve follow-through on the Paris Agreement’s core obligations.

For the first time at a COP, countries formally acknowledged the threat of climate disinformation. The text includes commitments to promote “information integrity” and counter narratives that erode trust in science or climate policy. Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva had opened the summit calling it “the COP of truth,” and the decision reflects that political framing.

What negotiators could not agree on

A draft text circulating 24 hours before the close contained explicit fossil-fuel phase-out language, reflecting Brazil’s proposal for a global roadmap backed by more than 80 countries. It was removed after protracted discussions.

Before the final plenary, Brazilian scientist Carlos Nobre warned that fossil fuel use must fall to zero by 2040–2045 to avoid temperature rises of up to 2.5°C. Without deep reductions, he said, the world faces “the near-total loss of coral reefs, the collapse of the Amazon rainforest and an accelerated melt of the Greenland ice sheet.”

COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago acknowledged the gap between ambition and outcome: “We know some of you had greater ambitions for some of the issues at hand,” he said. “I know the youth civil society will demand us to do more to fight climate change. I want to reaffirm that I will try not to disappoint you during my presidency.”

He committed to preparing two new roadmaps: one on halting and reversing deforestation, and another on transitioning away from fossil fuels “in a just, orderly and equitable manner,” with resources mobilised “in a just and planned manner.”

RELATED ARTICLE: COP30: Day 9 Recap

Fractures, setbacks and a late-night push for consensus

The talks unfolded against a difficult backdrop. Indigenous groups staged blockades demanding stronger protections for the Amazon. A fire at the venue on Thursday disrupted negotiations at a critical moment. Delegates worked through the night to bridge gaps on finance and ambition, with Brazil steering discussions toward outcomes built on past COP commitments rather than reopening core disputes.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres, speaking from the G20 Summit in Johannesburg, said the outcome showed that nations “can still unite to confront challenges no country can solve alone.” But he added: “I cannot pretend that COP30 has delivered everything that is needed. Overshoot of 1.5°C is a stark warning: deep, rapid emission cuts and massive climate finance are essential. COP30 is over, but the work is not.”

The Mutirão deal and the wider action agenda

The centrepiece of the conference is the Mutirão text, a consolidated package spanning mitigation, finance, trade barriers and implementation. Seventeen additional decisions were adopted alongside it. The document declares the global shift toward low-emission and climate-resilient development “irreversible,” reaffirming that the Paris Agreement “must go further and faster.”

Voluntary commitments under the Action Agenda added momentum. The Tropical Forests Forever Fund raised $5.5 billion across 53 countries, with at least 20 percent earmarked for Indigenous Peoples and local communities. The Belém Health Action Plan launched as the first global initiative targeting climate-related health threats, backed by $300 million from 35 philanthropic organisations. Public utilities under the UNEZA Alliance pledged $66 billion annually for renewables and $82 billion for transmission and storage.

A coalition of cities, regions and companies reported cutting over 850,000 tons of CO₂ in 2024 across 25,000 buildings, pointing to operational action beyond national pledges.

A global moment with longer-term consequences

For investors, policymakers and corporate leaders, the outcome clarifies the direction of travel: large-scale finance, accelerated implementation tools and expanding pressure for a just energy transition. The absence of explicit fossil-fuel phase-out language keeps the debate alive, but Brazil’s commitment to develop a roadmap ensures it will resurface ahead of COP31.

Renewable investments already outpace fossil fuels two to one. With geopolitical pressures rising, Belém’s outcome demonstrates that multilateral climate cooperation remains intact — though strained — as countries attempt to keep 1.5°C within reach.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/COP30-sets-1.3-Trillion-Climate-Finance-Goal-but-Delays-Fossil-Fuel-Decision.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 14:57:15.988686

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has released the Value of Air Transport Study for Uzbekistan, showing that the country’s focus on aviation has driven growing benefits for employment and economic activity.

In Uzbekistan, 12,400 people are directly employed in aviation, generating USD 96.5 million in economic output, equivalent to 0.1% of total GDP. Wider benefits come from the supply chain, employee spending, and tourism, contributing a total of USD 795.5 million, or 0.9% of GDP, and supporting 128,000 jobs.

“Uzbekistan’s continued investment in new airport infrastructure, safety improvements, and in people have played a key role in supporting a resilient and robust aviation sector, strengthening the burgeoning tourism industry and foreign direct investment in the country. It is also key to developing the country’s attractiveness as a future east-west transit hub for both passengers and cargo,” said Rafael Schvartzman, IATA Regional Vice President for Europe.

Tourism supported by aviation contributes USD 282.9 million to GDP, while international tourists are estimated to inject USD 2 billion annually into the wider economy through local goods and services. Uzbekistan is also expanding as a transit point for air cargo. In 2023, 66,600 tonnes of air cargo were transported through Uzbek airports. The opening of a dedicated cargo terminal at Tashkent Airport and continued growth at Navoi’s cargo airport are expected to further increase volumes.

Uzbekistan’s central location in Central Asia provides strategic connectivity to neighbouring states and links between Asia, the Caucasus, and Europe. This position supports investment in aviation infrastructure and employment, with spillover benefits for tourism, trade, and foreign direct investment.

Policymakers are advised to focus on four key priorities to strengthen Uzbekistan’s aviation sector. First, alignment with global standards and best practices is essential for safe, efficient, and affordable air transport, increasing the country’s attractiveness as a hub between Europe and Asia. Second, infrastructure expansion, including new airports in Tashkent, Bukhara, and Urgench, must remain cost competitive to support passenger and cargo growth. Third, the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) should follow international standards to ensure environmental integrity and global acceptance, leveraging Uzbekistan’s Gas-to-Liquids experience while focusing on renewable or low-carbon gases. Finally, investment in people is critical, with a growing workforce needing upskilling and retention to maintain safe and efficient operations.

Introduction

This Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been prepared to inform the Scottish Government’s consultation on the draft Climate Change Plan (CCP).

What are the aims and objectives of the CCP?

Tackling the climate emergency is one of the Scottish Government’s four key priorities, and the CCP is one of the Scottish Government’s foremost strategies towards mitigating the effects of climate change, as part of its wider intent to address the twin crises of climate change and nature loss.

This latest CCP updates on Scotland’s climate change ambitions, detailing the policies and proposals to achieve the Scottish Government's duty to meet the first three of Scotland’s carbon budgets (running from 2026-2030, 2031-2035, and 2036-2040). In doing so, this plan sets a pathway towards Scotland achieving net zero by 2045.

Beyond the emissions reduction, this plan also sets out how these targets will be met in a way that maximises the opportunities of the transition and is fair for people across Scotland.

What are the proposals and policies within the CCP?

Policies and proposals within the CCP are broken down by each sector in the economy and society within which the action will be taken forward. The sectors referenced by this plan are specified by legislation[1]:

energy supply;

transport (including international aviation and shipping);

business and industrial process;

residential and public (in relation to buildings in those sectors);

waste management;

land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF); and

agriculture.

This CCP contains 163 policies and proposals aiming to meet 30 outcomes.

What is Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)?

Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is a means of systematically assessing the likely impact of a public plan on the environment and to seek ways to avoid, or minimise where possible adverse effects and enhance positive effects. SEA provides an opportunity for the public to consider this information and to use it to inform their views on the emerging proposals.

This Environmental Report sets out the findings of the assessment of the draft CCP. The Environmental Report has been published alongside the draft plan for public consultation.

The Environmental Report has been prepared in accordance with the Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Act 2005. Views are invited on both the Environmental Report and the policies and proposals outlined in the consultation paper.

What is the current state of the environment?

Scotland’s environment is rich in natural and cultural heritage and our network of European protected sites also supports many important and rare plants, birds and animals. Global declines in biodiversity are however mirrored in Scotland. Scotland’s air, soil and water are generally in good condition, but there are concentrations of pollution in some parts of the country. Some of this is historic, but there are also on-going challenges, including diffuse pollution from urban and rural areas. A high-quality environment with good air, soil and water quality is an important contributor to population health and well-being.

Climate change is expected to lead to increases in water scarcity and flood risk across Scotland and will accelerate the rate of biodiversity loss.

Scotland has high quality landscapes, with many iconic views and scenic areas. Scotland also has many natural resources and material assets, including high quality agricultural land, and extensive areas of forestry and woodland. Scotland’s land use is dominated by agriculture and forestry, which together account for around 80% of total land cover. The historic environment includes world heritage sites, listed buildings, scheduled monuments, gardens and designed landscapes, battlefields, and conservation areas. The majority of the historic environment in Scotland is, however, undesignated.

How have reasonable alternatives been considered?

Consideration of alternatives was undertaken as the emerging plan developed. The extent to which alternatives for the CCP could be considered ‘reasonable’ was influenced by the legislative framework for the plan. The context for reasonable alternatives is limited by the requirements to meet ambitious statutory emissions reduction targets. Therefore, reasonable alternatives do not include consideration of a ‘do nothing’ scenario, as the CCP is a legislative requirement of The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. Based on the current legislative context, and the declared climate emergency, it was that the current ambition can only be to achieve the maximum emissions reductions possible, reflected across all sectors based on current technical and practical limitations, and it was therefore concluded that no reasonable alternative could be identified. Possible mitigation and enhancement has, however, been considered for each CCP sector where relevant and applicable and the findings from this assessment are presented in Section 4.

What are the likely environmental effects of the options assessed?

Buildings (Residential and Public)

Overall positive effects are anticipated for climatic factors, air quality, and population and human health. The use of synthetic insulation materials, which have a high carbon footprint during production, may offset some of the positive effects for climatic factors. Potential localised negative effects were identified for biodiversity, soil and water. The cumulative impact of renewable technologies like solar panels and heat pumps may alter landscapes and affect the appearance of cultural heritage assets.

Transport

Overall positive effects are anticipated for climatic factors, air quality, and population and human health. Mixed effects are anticipated for material assets as greater pressure may be put on the electricity grid from the expansion of electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure, requiring upgrades to be made to facilitate this transition. There is the potential for negative impacts on biodiversity and landscape depending on the source of biomass required to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and the harvesting practices utilised.

Waste

Positive effects are anticipated for climatic factors, material assets, cultural heritage, landscape, air and biodiversity through various circular economy initiatives, improved waste services, and extended producer responsibility policies. Localised negative effects on soil may arise from the construction and operation of new waste facilities.

Energy Supply

Overall positive effects are anticipated for climatic factors, air quality, population and human health and material assets. Integrating Energy from Waste (EfW) facilities into heat networks requires careful planning and coordination with local authorities and energy providers. It is assumed that existing regulatory regimes will ensure that any development projects will be subject to appropriate controls, minimising the potential for any negative impacts from such schemes.

Business and Industrial Process

Overall positive effects are anticipated for air, climatic factors, population and human health, and material assets. Potential negative effects were identified for biodiversity, landscape, and cultural heritage associated with retrofitting of industrial buildings and infrastructure changes for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).

Agriculture

Positive effects are anticipated for climatic factors, soils, biodiversity, water, air quality, population and human health, material assets and landscapes. The effects of investigating and encouraging uptake of technologies for alternative, improved or more efficient fertilisers are considered to be uncertain as the level of uptake cannot yet be determined due to the early-stage of technological understanding. In undertaking this assessment it has been assumed that nature friendly farming may include practices such as growing organic produce and reduced tillage.

Land use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF)

Positive effects are anticipated for climatic factors, soils, and biodiversity, primarily through peatland restoration, rewetting, and improved monitoring. Additional benefits for water, material assets, and population and human health may arise from peatlands’ water storage function. Potential negative effects on landscape and material assets could occur due to land use conflicts, such as the loss of productive agricultural land for woodland creation or peatland restoration.

How can any negative environmental effects be avoided, minimised or mitigated or positive effects enhanced?

Where relevant and appropriate, potential mitigation measures have been identified and include:

Supporting regional or landscape-scale coordination of actions and embedding sector-specific targets

Careful siting and design of industrial buildings, energy infrastructure and woodland creation schemes

Promotion of sustainable materials for construction and retrofit.

What monitoring is proposed?

Section 35B of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 requires Ministers to lay an annual progress report on each substantive chapter of the CCP.

A monitoring framework has been developed for the CCP which sets out indicators for each policy outcome and progress towards key milestones and targets. Delivery of every milestone in the CCP will contribute to reduction of emissions and many of the milestones relate to delivery of strategies, plans or policies which will have wider significant positive effects on the environment. Monitoring of progress towards key milestones and targets will therefore enable early identification of issues with delivery of positive environmental benefits and any unforeseen adverse effects. It is suggested that the monitoring of the environmental effects identified in this SEA combines the monitoring framework for the CCP with other key environmental indicators in order to identify potential correlation between progress towards outcomes and other unforeseen environmental changes, and to trigger further investigation of potential causation.

Policy documents linked to the SDGs contain ‘significantly more’ references to academic research than those related to other topics, it noted.

SDG-related policy

India leads the way in terms of using academic research to support SDG-related policy, with 41% of said documents citing such research. Some 28% of these citations are exclusively Indian-authored research, while 13% are international contributions.

According to the report, this reliance on academic research is due to India’s ‘strong public research ecosystem, where more than half of the research output originates from government-funded institutions, and the increasing presence of Indian experts on national policy advisory bodies’.

Other countries to report a high degree of academic research in SDG-related policy documents include Australia and Brazil.

On a global level, while 78% of the research cited in SDG-related policy comes from authors in the Global North, India and Brazil are notable exceptions, with domestic research more frequently cited in these markets.

Making an impact

“With just five years until the 2030 deadline for the SDGs, understanding how research informs policy is critical,” commented Nicola Jones, sirector, SDG Programme, Springer Nature. “We know science and research can solve problems, but only if it reaches decision makers.

“This analysis is the missing piece of the puzzle, showing quantifiably for the first time where research has an impact on the goals and where gaps remain. We’ve learnt so much, and we hope what we’ve found sparks collaboration across the research ecosystem to help close those gaps.”

Elsewhere, Katie Shamash, head of data at Overton, added that the study “paints a much clearer picture of how research is being used in practice to drive real policy change and advance the Goals”.

The airline and the engineering firm’s announcement forms part of their commitment to accelerate sustainable energy solutions in aviation. Samsung E&A will build on existing feedstock capacity and infrastructure in the US with its engineering expertise. Meanwhile, Korean Air has signed to become a SAF buyer, ensuring critical long-term demand. Other airlines including Delta and Air France have struck similar agreements to nurture the SAF industry as it takes flight.

Samsung E&A is considering participating in a SAF project that uses gasification–Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology. This second-generation SAF fuels converts abundant woody waste into synthetic liquid fuel, a significant advance on first-generation processes that use limited supplies of waste cooking oil.

On the partnership with Samsung E&A, a spokesperson for Korean Air commented:

This partnership will further contribute to the aviation industry’s Net Zero 2050 goal and enhance our ability to effectively navigate evolving global environmental regulations, including SAF mandates. Through proactive project participation and continuous cooperation, we aim to accelerate global SAF adoption and advance our commitment to sustainable aviation and ESG management.

A report from IATA earlier this year found that SAF production is currently on track to fall 100 million tonnes short of net-zero emissions targets. The air transport association emphasise that investing in technology, not feedstock, was critical to ramping up sustainability efforts. If successful, Korean Air and Samsung’s new partnership will contribute directly to addressing this issue.

“Asia-Pacific airlines continue to demonstrate agility in managing supply chain constraints, with capacity growth keeping pace with demand.
The supply chain squeeze is worsened by ageing aircraft, rising shop-visit volumes, and a persistent labour shortage, with skilled engineers drawn to higher-paying hubs in the Middle East.
“When we look at supply chain pressures, there are many aspects to it.
He emphasised that building a resilient supply chain requires coordination across industry, finance, trade, and manpower agencies.","Asia-Pacific airlines are heading into 2026 with a strong performance outlook, but industry leaders warn that governments must shift from short-term tourism gains to long-term industrial competitiveness to sustain growth.

At the close of the 69th Assembly of Presidents in Bangkok, the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) reported that carriers posted a 10 per cent rise in international passenger traffic in the first nine months of 2025, outpacing global averages and reinforcing confidence in the region’s recovery momentum.

“Asia-Pacific airlines continue to demonstrate agility in managing supply chain constraints, with capacity growth keeping pace with demand. However, Asia-Pacific economies are among the hardest hit by higher US tariffs. Further escalation of tariffs could exacerbate these bottlenecks,” noted AAPA director general Subhas Menon.

AAPA leaders also urged governments to strengthen maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) capacity and accelerate aviation manufacturing, warning that the region’s fragmented industrial footprint risks constraining future growth. While International Air Transport Association (IATA) data shows Asia-Pacific accounts for more than one-third of global passenger traffic, much of the world’s heavy maintenance and aviation manufacturing remains in North America and Europe, forcing airlines to route high-complexity engine work offshore.

The supply chain squeeze is worsened by ageing aircraft, rising shop-visit volumes, and a persistent labour shortage, with skilled engineers drawn to higher-paying hubs in the Middle East. Menon warned that without intervention, the region risks permanent constraints on growth.

“When we look at supply chain pressures, there are many aspects to it. But what can you do in the interim to improve the situation? For example, the region simply does not have enough MRO capacity, and only government investment and support can close that gap,” Menon stated.

Menon highlighted that some administrations still take aviation resilience for granted. He cited Asia’s prolonged pandemic border closures as an example of governments assuming airlines would cope, and warned that fragmented policymaking is emerging again, with MRO expansion, workforce development, industrial incentives, and regulatory measures pursued separately rather than strategically.

He emphasised that building a resilient supply chain requires coordination across industry, finance, trade, and manpower agencies. Signs of progress include Thailand’s coordinated approach to its one per cent SAF blend for 2026, involving the energy ministry, civil aviation authority, and fuel suppliers.

“From a long-term standpoint, if this is the largest air transport sector in the world, and the fastest growing, governments should take an interest in it and invest in the infrastructure that is needed for airlines to be able to support the growth. Yes, we do not have a common regulator, so it is a challenge. But that should not stop us from doing the right thing,” he summarised.

The Assembly adopted four resolutions, reaffirming the five per cent SAF target for 2030, urging governments to accelerate production, calling for investment incentives and harmonised regulations to expand MRO and manufacturing, endorsing stronger lithium battery safety measures, and cautioning against non–cost-related taxes that could undermine long-term growth.",https://ttgasia.2017.ttgasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AAPA-DG-Subhas-Menon-640.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 07:57:44.083193

“Our thesis is to accelerate low-carbon technology innovation by supporting first-of-a-kind pilot projects,” said Hao Xu, the company’s head of climate innovation.
Partners get products to market Alongside the financial support, Tencent is connecting winners with larger companies that can help bring products to market.
Another benefit: Carbon credits The funding is designed to drive decarbonization across multiple sectors, but Tencent is also using the competitions to accelerate its own net-zero journey.
Xu anticipates that some of the companies in the competitions will generate carbon credits that Tencent will sign offtake agreements for.","Chinese tech giant Tencent is investing tens of millions of dollars in innovation competitions in carbon removal and other areas as is it looks to cut emissions and define a role for itself as a sustainability leader.

The company, which generated revenues of $92 billion in 2024 from messaging and payments platform WeChat and other products, has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2030 — with credits used to neutralize ongoing emissions — and net zero by 2050. Major U.S. tech firms, including Microsoft and Google, have similar goals and, like Tencent, are focusing on renewable energy as a core strategy. But Tencent is taking a different path with its additional focus on prizes.

“Our thesis is to accelerate low-carbon technology innovation by supporting first-of-a-kind pilot projects,” said Hao Xu, the company’s head of climate innovation.

Tencent’s first competition, CarbonX 1.0, opened to Chinese companies in 2023. The call for proposals elicited 300 entrants, from which 13 winners were awarded a total of $13 million. Winners included a modular direct air capture system developed at Zhejiang University and technology developed by the startup Feynman Dynamics that converts carbon dioxide into sustainable aviation fuel.

The funding is designed to help young companies overcome the “valley of death” between laboratory work and commercialization — an issue Xu said Tencent identified as the “real bottleneck” to scaling emerging low-carbon technologies.

Partners get products to market

Alongside the financial support, Tencent is connecting winners with larger companies that can help bring products to market. One example: Suzhou Kunsheng Biodegradable New Material Company, which produces a foam for cushions made from captured carbon, is partnering with HAY, a Danish furniture maker that plans on using the foam in its products.

Last month, Tencent announced 50 finalists for CarbonX 2.0, a global competition with a $28-million prize pot that attracted more than 660 applicants from 54 countries. Entrants span CO2 removal, carbon capture in the steel industry, products made from captured carbon and long-duration energy storage. Product partners in this second phase include McDonald’s China and PepsiCo, with winners expected to be announced next year.

Another benefit: Carbon credits

The funding is designed to drive decarbonization across multiple sectors, but Tencent is also using the competitions to accelerate its own net-zero journey. To fulfill its 2030 carbon-neutral goal, for example, the company will need to retire around a million metric tons of carbon credits annually. Xu anticipates that some of the companies in the competitions will generate carbon credits that Tencent will sign offtake agreements for.

The company is also considering creating a third competition next year, likely smaller in scale, to incentivize commercialization of building materials, which would be used in the ongoing construction of its new headquarters in Shenzhen.

Tech-sector climate ambition

Companies in the U.S. and Europe also fund competitions, including a 2024 innovation challenge aimed at low-carbon materials that was backed by Microsoft. But the most prominent climate-related competitions have been led by XPRIZE, the nonprofit that oversaw a $100 million carbon removal prize and is now developing a methane mitigation competition. Tencent’s approach is notable in the private sector for both its scope and the size of the financial commitment.

The company’s investment in prizes extends its core climate strategy, which is focused on reducing emissions from data centers and other sources. Tencent’s commitment to cut operational emissions 70 percent by 2030 has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative, alongside its goal to shave 30 percent off emissions from suppliers, product use and other indirect sources in the same timeframe. Longer-term, it’s targeting a 90 percent reduction across all sources by 2050.

Together with Tencent’s 2030 carbon-neutral goal, these targets roughly match the ambition of U.S. tech companies that are seen as leaders on climate, including Google and Microsoft. But Xu argued that the tech sector must pass the baton soon.

“If you look at the decarbonization journey for the whole planet, technology companies shouldn’t be the major force simply because their emissions are limited in absolute terms,” he said. “But we are inspired to be the risk-takers. What we can do is to push the technology forward.”",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shutterstock-Image-2094870757.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 07:57:57.918680

The transit passenger exemption Here’s where it gets controversial: transit passengers won’t pay the SAF Levy at all.
Region banding is odd – but logical Singapore has also been clever in its band allocation for the SAF Levy.
Summary Singapore’s new SAF Levy adds yet another layer of costs to award redemptions from Changi Airport.","Singapore is set to introduce a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) levy that will add between S$1 and S$41.60 to every departing flight ticket from October 2026, making it the first country globally to impose such a charge.

ADVERTISEMENT

Coming on top of the 21% airport fee increases we covered last year, this new levy – applicable to tickets sold from 1st April 2026 – means award redemptions from the Lion City face a double whammy that will push cash costs beyond our earlier projections.

What is the new SAF Levy?

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced the levy rates on 10th November 2025. The levy supports Singapore’s goal of having 1% of jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports allocated as SAF – a renewable, low-carbon alternative to conventional jet fuel – by 2026, rising to 3 – 5% by 2030.

The charges vary based on two factors: your destination and cabin class.

Economy and Premium Economy passengers face lower fees than those in Business and First Class, with the premium cabin levy set at four times the economy rate, Singapore’s first travel-class-differentiated aviation tax.

SAF Levy Rates (from 1st October 2026)

Here are the SAF Levy rates, applicable on a per-passenger basis for air tickets departing from Singapore sold on or after 1st April 2026, for departures from Singapore from 1st October 2026 onwards.

Singapore SAF Levy

(per passenger) Geographical Band Economy Class

Premium Economy Business Class

First Class Band 1 Southeast Asia S$1.00 S$4.00 Band 2 NE Asia, South Asia, Australia, PNG S$2.80 S$11.20 Band 3 Africa, Central/West Asia, Europe, Middle East, Pacific Islands, NZ S$6.40 S$25.60 Band 4 Americas S$10.40 S$41.60

These fees will also be added to the cash element of award redemption tickets, and are in addition to the departure airport charges and taxes – currently set at S$65.20 per passenger but progressively increasing to S$79.20 per passenger in the coming years.

ADVERTISEMENT

Carrier surcharges are also in addition when travelling on selected airlines, while on some routings, like Singapore – Australia, arrival taxes are also charged by the destination country.

Double whammy: Airport fees also increasing

Compounding the pain for award travellers, Changi is already raising passenger fees by 21% from April 2027 to April 2030, as we reported last year, lifting the current S$65.20 departure charge (Passenger Service / Security Fee, Aviation Levy and Airport Development Levy combined) to S$79.20.

This is designed to fund S$3 billion in projects like Terminal 3 upgrades and the eventual Terminal 5.

This means award redemptions will face a double hit: SAF Levy from October 2026, plus fee hikes from April 2027, pushing 2030 taxes for a New York Business Class ticket to S$145, over 60% more than today’s fees – assuming the SAF Levy does not change.

Impact on award redemptions

Let’s examine how these combined increases will affect popular award redemptions from Singapore. The following tables show the total taxes and fees payable on award tickets, including both the SAF Levy and the progressive airport charge increases.

Example: Band 1 Economy Class

Singapore to Southeast Asia

Economy / Premium Economy Period Airport Fees SAF Levy Total Taxes Current S$65.20 — S$65.20 Oct 2026 – Mar 2027 S$65.20 S$1.00 S$66.20 Apr 2027 – Mar 2028 S$70.20 S$1.00 S$71.20 Apr 2028 – Mar 2029 S$73.20 S$1.00 S$74.20 Apr 2029 – Mar 2030 S$76.20 S$1.00 S$77.20 From Apr 2030 S$79.20 S$1.00 S$80.20

Here the SAF Levy impact is minimal – by April 2030 taxes of S$80.20 are 23% higher than today, but 93% of that increase stems from already-announced airport fee hikes, only 7% is from the SAF Levy, which is only charged at S$1 on these routings.

For example, a Scoot Saver award SIN-PEN booked using KrisFlyer miles is currently priced at:

1,500 miles + S$65.20

For travel from 1st October 2026, booked on or after 1st April 2026, the price will be:

1,500 miles + S$66.20 (+2% cash element)

Example: Band 3 Business Class

Singapore to Europe

Business / First Class Period Airport Fees SAF Levy Total Taxes Current S$65.20 — S$65.20 Oct 2026 – Mar 2027 S$65.20 S$25.60 S$90.80 Apr 2027 – Mar 2028 S$70.20 S$25.60 S$95.80 Apr 2028 – Mar 2029 S$73.20 S$25.60 S$98.80 Apr 2029 – Mar 2030 S$76.20 S$25.60 S$101.80 From Apr 2030 S$79.20 S$25.60 S$104.80

On longer routes like London in Business Class the effect is more marked. Here a near-S$40 increase in taxes by April 2030 is only 35% attributable to airport fee hikes, 65% of the increase is down to the SAF Levy.

For example, a Singapore Airlines Saver award SIN-LHR booked using KrisFlyer miles is currently priced at:

108,500 miles + S$65.20

For travel from 1st October 2026, booked on or after 1st April 2026, the price will be:

108,500 miles + S$90.80 (+39% cash element)

Example: Band 4 Business Class

* Includes USA arrival taxes of S$24, subject to change

Non-stop flights from Singapore to the USA are the hardest hit – already more expensive than most redemptions thanks to USA arrival taxes, and in Business Class a new S$41.60 SAF Levy kicks in from 1st October 2026.

For example, a Singapore Airlines Saver award SIN-LAX booked using KrisFlyer miles is currently priced at:

112,500 miles + S$89.20

For travel from 1st October 2026, booked on or after 1st April 2026, the price will be:

112,500 miles + S$130.80 (+47% cash element)

The impact represents a smaller proportion when redeeming award tickets with carriers that impose significant surcharges on top of mandatory taxes, like fuel surcharges or award segment fees.

For example, a Qatar Airways Business Class award from Singapore to London via Doha will increase in cost from 75,000 Avios + S$349.40 today, to 75,000 Avios + S$375.00 from 1st October 2026 (a 7% cash increase).

Similarly a British Airways Business Class award non-stop from Singapore to London will increase in cost from 110,000 Avios + S$289.80 today, to 110,000 Avios + S$315.40 from 1st October 2026 (a 9% cash increase).

Ironically, KrisFlyer members will therefore feel the biggest relative impact. While other programmes already sting with carrier surcharges that dwarf these new fees, Singapore Airlines’ surcharge-free awards mean members feel the full weight of the increase.

The transit passenger exemption

Here’s where it gets controversial: transit passengers won’t pay the SAF Levy at all. This exemption applies to around a third of Singapore Airlines’ passengers overall, who merely connect through the carrier’s Changi hub en-route from their origin to destination city.

On some SIA routes like London, transit passengers account for over 60% of passengers.

The decision makes commercial sense – Singapore needs to remain competitive as a transit hub competing with the likes of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Doha, and Hong Kong – but it creates an odd situation where Singapore residents effectively subsidise the costs of purchasing SAF for transit passengers, who fly alongside them on the same routes.

Higher taxes for premium cabins

With this levy, Singapore not only becomes the first country globally to impose a mandatory SAF Levy on passengers – a distinction that may not be entirely welcome – but also joins an exclusive club of jurisdictions that differentiate aviation taxation by travel class.

These include Hong Kong, the Maldives, the United Kingdom, and France.

The Business and First Class cabin multiplier of four times the Economy and Premium Economy rates for the upcoming SAF Levy is based on IATA’s Passenger CO2 Calculation Methodology.

How to avoid the levy (for now)

There’s a simple strategy to avoid the SAF Levy, at least temporarily: book your tickets before 1st April 2026, for any travel after 1st October 2026. The levy only applies to tickets sold from April 2026 onwards, regardless of how far beyond October 2026 you travel.

ADVERTISEMENT

However, with most airlines only selling tickets 11-12 months in advance, this window of opportunity is somewhat limited. For shorter regional routes in Economy where the levy is just S$1 or S$2.80, the extra effort is probably not worthwhile, unless your plans are definite.

But for that New York Business Class redemption? The S$41.60 saving per person could make it worth planning ahead.

Can you ‘game’ the system with a stopover?

You might think booking flights with stopovers could reduce the levy, since it’s only based on your flight’s immediate next destination, not your entire ticketed itinerary.

Technically true, flying Singapore – Hong Kong – San Francisco on Cathay Pacific will attract just S$2.80 / S$11.20 in SAF Levy, versus S$10.40 / S$41.60 for the non-stop Singapore – San Francisco Singapore Airlines or United Airlines flights.

The problem, however, is twofold:

It’s not free to transit through Hong Kong

Around S$37 / S$41 is payable in Economy / Business Class. This immediately outweighs any SAF Levy saving

Cathay Pacific applies a fuel surcharge on its award tickets

Currently set at around S$119 for a SIN-HKG-SFO routing

For Business Class, this brings the award cost to 115,000 Asia Miles + S$279.70, instead of 112,500 KrisFlyer miles + S$130.80. Yes, technically Singapore is collecting S$30.40 less in SAF Levy from your ticket – but it’s certainly not worth it since you are paying much more overall.

ADVERTISEMENT

In another example, choosing Finnair’s one-stop service from Singapore to New York via Helsinki attracts the Band 3 charge instead of Band 4 – an example that saves S$16 in Business Class SAF Levy versus Singapore Airlines’ non-stop service.

However, this award flight will cost you 125,000 Avios + S$187.60, compared to 117,000 KrisFlyer miles + S$130.80, because even though the SAF Levy will indeed be S$16.00 less, you’ll also be hit with:

Finnair’s fuel surcharge: S$22.60

Finland’s transfer passenger fee: S$9.30

Finland’s security charge: S$9.50

Finland’s air transport supervision charge: S$1.40

USA International arrival tax: S$30.00 (not applicable to SIA award tickets)

Net effect: Singapore will of course get S$16 less in SAF Levy from you, but you’ll pay S$56.80 more in total fees, not to mention the inconvenience of a Helsinki layover and the difference in miles outlay.

As you can see, any SAF savings from choosing stopovers are typically offset by additional airport taxes at the transit point.

There’s one exception we found, and that’s SIA’s Singapore – Tokyo – Los Angeles service (SQ12/11).

Taxes on this two-sector journey are only S$16.20 more than for the carrier’s Singapore – Los Angeles non-stop flights, because Japan applies minimal additional charges for international transit passengers.

That will make it S$14.20 cheaper to redeem in Business / First Class, once the SAF Levy kicks in (and of course this routing is your only SIA First Class option to Los Angeles anyway).

However, in Economy or Premium Economy it’s still slightly more expensive to stop in Narita – by S$8.60.

Region banding is odd – but logical

Singapore has also been clever in its band allocation for the SAF Levy.

Notice how the Middle East is lumped into Band 3 alongside Europe, despite Singapore – Dubai being shorter than Singapore – Sydney (Band 2)? This classification means passengers flying Middle East carriers (Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways) to Europe pay the same S$6.40 / S$25.60 SAF Levy as those on non-stop European services.

It’s likely a strategic move to prevent the Gulf carriers’ one-stop routings becoming more attractive from a cost perspective.

While that doesn’t particularly affect award tickets much (ME3 airlines add insane carrier charges to redemption tickets), Singapore Airlines in particular would be at a significant disadvantage if it had to charge a higher SAF Levy for cash tickets on non-stop Europe flights than Emirates did for the same routing via Dubai.

Beyond passenger flights: Cargo and private jets also hit

The levy extends beyond commercial passengers. Cargo shipments will pay S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram depending on destination, while private jets and business aviation face aircraft-based charges ranging from S$40 for small aircraft on regional routes to S$6,500 for large jets flying to the Americas.

What’s driving this charge?

CAAS positions the levy as essential for aviation sustainability, with funds going into a statutory SAF Fund managed solely for purchasing sustainable aviation fuel and environmental attributes. The Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo) will handle procurement and administration.

The timing is significant – while SAF production doubled last year, it still accounts for only 0.3% of global jet fuel volumes according to IATA. Singapore’s target of 1% by 2026, potentially rising to 3-5% by 2030, is ambitious given the limited global supply.

SAF currently costs three to four times more than traditional jet fuel.

ADVERTISEMENT

The rates announced are actually lower than initial estimates from early 2024, when CAAS projected S$3, S$6 and S$16 for Economy travel to Bangkok, Tokyo and London respectively.

The actual rates of S$1, S$2.80 and S$6.40 reflect lower prevailing SAF costs – though this silver lining may be temporary. Mr Han expects the levy to remain at current levels “for a few years” while the target stays at 1%.

Industry concerns

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has acknowledged the early announcement of Singapore’s SAF Levy as positive for planning purposes, but expressed concern about its potential “dampening effect on air travel”.

While IATA recognises that Singapore’s model may suit its unique circumstances – particularly its limited capacity to produce SAF domestically – the association is hesitant to recommend such a policy framework to other countries.

Nonetheless, Singapore Airlines has thrown its support behind the levy, stating it aligns with the SIA Group’s commitment to gradually increase sustainable aviation fuel use. Meanwhile, major logistics airlines DHL and FedEx are still assessing the impact on their cargo operations.

The bigger picture: Award costs climbing

For award travellers based in Singapore, these stacking fees will be another erosion of redemption value, a topic that’s fresh in many minds following a hike in KrisFlyer redemption rates that kicked in earlier this month.

By 2030, a Business Class award to Europe will attract over S$100 in taxes before even considering carrier surcharges or destination fees. Ultra long-haul Business Class redemptions to the Americas will see total taxes approaching S$145.

The levy is supposedly fixed while the SAF target remains at 1%, but CAAS has already signalled it will be reviewed when it increases to 3 – 5% by 2030.

Summary

Singapore’s new SAF Levy adds yet another layer of costs to award redemptions from Changi Airport. While the amounts seem modest in isolation – especially for short-haul Economy travel – they compound with the already-announced airport fee increases to create a bigger impact on redemption value, especially on longer routes.

For frequent flyers planning premium cabin long-haul redemptions, the strategy is to book before April 2026 where possible, but after that everyone will need to factor these increasing costs into their redemption calculations.

In Uzbekistan, 12,400 people are directly employed in aviation, generating USD 96.5 million in economic output, equal to 0.1% of total GDP. Additional benefits are generated by the wider supply chain, employee spending, and tourism activities, contributing a total of USD 795.5 million, or 0.9%, to GDP and supporting 128,000 jobs.

“Uzbekistan’s continued investment in new airport infrastructure, safety improvements, and in people have played a key role in supporting a resilient and robust aviation sector, strengthening the burgeoning tourism industry and foreign direct investment in the country. It is also key to developing the country’s attractiveness as a future east-west transit hub for both passengers and cargo,” said Rafael Schvartzman, IATA Regional Vice President for Europe.

Tourism directly supported by aviation contributes USD 282.9 million to the country’s GDP, while international tourists to Uzbekistan are estimated to contribute USD 2 billion annually to the wider economy through the purchase of goods and services from local businesses.

Uzbekistan has also played a growing role as a transit point for air cargo. IATA’s report shows that 66,600 tonnes of air cargo were transported through airports in Uzbekistan in 2023. With the opening of a dedicated cargo terminal at Tashkent Airport earlier this year and continued growth at Navoi’s dedicated cargo airport, further growth in cargo volumes is expected.

Key Priorities for Uzbekistan

The country's location in the heart of Central Asia offers strategic connectivity not just for neighboring states but also a link between Asia, the Caucasus, and Europe. This strategic location will drive not only greater investment in aviation infrastructure and employment but also spill over into the wider economy through tourism, trade, and foreign direct investment.

Policymakers should consider four key priorities for Uzbekistan’s aviation sector that would support its growth and attractiveness as a regional hub.

Global Standards: Alignment with global standards and best practice is vital. These standards—from safety to passenger processing—are the backbone of safe, affordable, and efficient air transport. It would also increase Uzbekistan’s attractiveness as a hub between Europe and Asia.

Infrastructure: While the construction of new airports in Tashkent, Bukhara, and Urgench will provide the capacity to support growth in passenger numbers and cargo volumes, it is critical to work with the industry to ensure cost competitiveness.

SAF Production and Energy Transition: Given Uzbekistan’s interest in producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), alignment with international standards incorporated into most major jet fuel regulations is a must. This will enable SAF produced in Uzbekistan to be used confidently by airlines and airports in other countries. While Uzbekistan can leverage its Gas-to-Liquids experience in the SAF transition, the focus should be on sourcing renewable or low-carbon gases to ensure the environmental integrity and international acceptance of its SAF production.

Investment in People: As the industry grows, there will be increased demand to upskill and retain a growing workforce needed to support a safe and efficient air transport industry.

Overall oil consumption will likely reach its peak around 2026, as the usage of refined oil products for fuel has already peaked and petrochemical feedstock demand will maintain moderate growth.","BEIJING, Nov. 24 (Xinhua) -- As China progresses towards its 2030 carbon-peaking target, the upcoming five years -- its next national planning cycle -- will be crucial. With coal and oil still at the heart of the energy system, they will be central to the country's climate efforts.

As ""work toward reaching peak consumption of coal and petroleum"" is part of the Communist Party of China Central Committee's recommendations for formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030) unveiled last month, how will the world's largest energy consumer achieve this goal while ensuring energy security?

China's shift toward clean energy has gained momentum since 2020, when the country pledged to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The share of non-fossil fuels in the country's total energy consumption has risen in line with national targets, along with the establishment of the world's largest and fastest-growing renewable energy system.

In the next five years, China plans to accelerate building a new-type energy system, one in which non-fossil sources replace fossil fuels in a secure, reliable and orderly manner.

Following the principle of maintaining a stable energy supply, coal consumption will be gradually reduced, while the remaining use will be made cleaner and more efficient. At the same time, China will fast-track the development of major clean energy bases, including wind and solar power in the northwest, hydropower in the southwest, offshore wind farms, and coastal nuclear power projects. New energy sources such as biogas, sustainable aviation fuel and geothermal energy will be advanced based on local conditions.

As coal and oil consumption reach their respective peaks, related industries may face challenges. In response, China plans to optimize industrial layouts and structures, expanding the share of advanced capacity while gradually phasing out inefficient coal mining and oil refining.

Official projections suggest that by 2030, fossil fuels will account for less than 75 percent of total energy consumption.

Coal consumption is expected to peak around 2027, with demand from steel and building materials gradually declining. Overall oil consumption will likely reach its peak around 2026, as the usage of refined oil products for fuel has already peaked and petrochemical feedstock demand will maintain moderate growth.

Achieving carbon peaking is not the end. In September 2025, China unveiled its new Nationally Determined Contributions, setting ambitious goals for 2035, including reducing economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions by 7 percent to 10 percent from peak levels, increasing the share of non-fossil fuels in total energy consumption to over 30 percent, and expanding the installed capacity of wind and solar power to over six times the 2020 levels.

Experts believe the new commitments mark China's entry into a more comprehensive and systematic phase of low-carbon, resilient development, strengthening the country's responsibility in tackling global climate change and injecting greater certainty and stability into international climate governance. ■",,N,,2025-11-24 05:56:47.121041

Dubai, United Arab Emirates: DHL Express, the world’s leading express and logistics services provider, has signed a strategic sustainability agreement with Landmark Group, marking a significant step forward in their mission to deliver carbon-neutral logistics across global trade lanes.

The partnership will see Landmark Group – which operates over 2,200 retail stores across 21 countries and employs more than 50,000 people regionally – use DHL’s GoGreen Plus programme to decarbonise its international air freight operations using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

DHL’s GoGreen Plus programme represents a fundamental shift from traditional carbon offsetting models. Rather than compensating for emissions through external environment projects, the service reduces the carbon loan directly within the supply chain by replacing conventional jet fuel with SAF produced from renewable feedstocks.

Every tonne of SAF used through GoGreen Plus reduces lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil fuels. The carbon savings are independently verified and certified by accredited third party SGS, Société Générale de Surveillanceensuring full accountability and traceability for customers.

The collaboration was formalised at DHL's UAE Head Office in Dubai by Mahmoud Haj Hussein, Country Manager of DHL Express UAE, and Rajesh Garg, Group Chief Financial Officer & Chief Sustainability Officer at Landmark Group.

On the occasion, Mahmoud Haj Hussein commented, “DHL has committed to investing €7 billion globally in climate-neutral logistics by 2030, and partnerships like this demonstrate how we're translating that ambition into measurable action. Landmark Group's decision to adopt GoGreen Plus reflects how progressive enterprises are keen on moving the industry toward a net-zero future. We're proud to support their decarbonisation goals with logistics solutions that deliver transparency, credibility, and real impact.""

Rajesh Garg added, ""At Landmark Group, we are embedding sustainability into every aspect of our business and supply chain. Our partnership with DHL marks an important step in reducing our Scope 3 emissions and advancing our decarbonisation goals through credible solutions like Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Collaboration with forward-thinking partners is essential as we transition toward a net-zero future.”

The collaboration supports the UAE’s National Net Zero by 2050 Strategy, which aims to position the country as a global leader in climate action and sustainable economic development. By reducing Scope 3 emissions, which are often the largest and most difficult category for enterprises to address, the two organisations are contributing to systemic transformation required to meet national and global climate targets.

He said it also marked a significant step in the country’s aviation decarbonisation efforts.
Johari said Malaysia’s SAF strategy is supported by the Malaysia Aviation Decarbonisation Blueprint (MADB) and the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), both of which map out phased pathways to reduce emissions and identify SAF as a priority fuel for the aviation sector.
The EcoCeres plant in Tanjung Langsat is Malaysia’s first SAF biorefinery and has a licensed annual production capacity of 350,000 tonnes.
“With global aviation moving toward mandatory carbon-reduction targets, Malaysia must secure its position in the emerging SAF market,” he said.","Pasir Gudang: Malaysia is pushing forward with its plan to become a regional hub for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by preparing to introduce a one per cent SAF blending mandate for international flights departing Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), reports New Straits Times.

Plantation and Commodities Minister Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani said the mandate — currently being finalised with the transport ministry and industry stakeholders — would form the core policy guiding Malaysia’s long-term shift toward low-carbon jet fuel. He said it also marked a significant step in the country’s aviation decarbonisation efforts.

Johari said Malaysia’s SAF strategy is supported by the Malaysia Aviation Decarbonisation Blueprint (MADB) and the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), both of which map out phased pathways to reduce emissions and identify SAF as a priority fuel for the aviation sector.

“To reinforce the commitment, we are working closely with stakeholders to introduce an initial one per cent SAF requirement for flights out of KLIA,” he said during a working visit to the EcoCeres Renewable Fuels Sdn Bhd biorefinery in Tanjung Langsat today.

Johari’s visit included a briefing on EcoCeres’ progress since the facility began SAF production in October. The company is preparing to ship its first batch to customers before the end of the year.

EcoCeres co-chairman James Tam, who hosted the minister and senior officials, said the milestone reflected years of engineering work and Malaysia’s growing capabilities in renewable fuel technologies.

“Our progress reflects years of innovation, teamwork and commitment in advancing Malaysia’s renewable fuel capabilities,” he said, adding that the Johor plant would play a central role in supporting the country’s energy-transition and global decarbonisation agenda.

The EcoCeres plant in Tanjung Langsat is Malaysia’s first SAF biorefinery and has a licensed annual production capacity of 350,000 tonnes. Equipped with integrated control and laboratory systems, the facility is expected to create strong downstream benefits as airlines and fuel suppliers prepare for tighter international emissions rules.

Johari said the growth of the plant supported Malaysia’s strategy to build a competitive low-carbon industry, adding that SAF development would help strengthen the country’s agri-commodity and biomass sectors.

“With global aviation moving toward mandatory carbon-reduction targets, Malaysia must secure its position in the emerging SAF market,” he said.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-4.png,N,,2025-11-24 05:57:03.396294

The Importance Of This Deal For Vietjet Thailand, this shift toward Boeing MAX jets is transformational.","Vietjet Thailand has officially become a Boeing 737 MAX operator: on 23 November 2025, the airline received its first Boeing 737 MAX 8 at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport. This delivery is the first of 50 MAX aircraft that will go to its Thai unit under a larger $32 billion order held by Vietjet Group.

This marks a major step in Vietjet’s fleet-standardization strategy and gives the carrier access to one of the most capable narrowbodies on the market. The company aims to boost efficiency by building a more harmonized fleet across its operations, and this Boeing delivery signals that ambition is taking off in Thailand.

What We Know About This Deal

Vietjet’s first Boeing 737 MAX 8, registered as HS-VZA, arrived in Bangkok as part of a long-term plan: these 50 aircraft are being transferred to Vietjet Thailand from the group’s total order of 200 Boeing jets. According to Vietjet, the aircraft will begin operating on domestic routes first: the inaugural service is planned for Bangkok–Chiang Mai, followed by a launch on the Bangkok–Cam Ranh (Vietnam) route in December 2025. Following its entry into Thailand, the brand-new Boeing will also be used on international services

In 2026, it will also fly to Japan, South Korea, and China. The Boeing 737 MAX features new-generation LEAP-1B engines, advanced aerodynamics, and a cabin (with a Boeing Sky Interior) designed for comfort. Vietjet highlights the jet’s environmental credentials: it is compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and reduces carbon emissions by 15–20%, while also offering up to 50% lower noise levels, in line with ICAO guidelines, as reported by the Viet Nam News agency. Vietjet Chair Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao said:

“The transfer of 50 modern and efficient Boeing 737-8 aircraft to Vietjet Thailand demonstrates our long-term commitment to sustainable aviation development in the region,”

The Broader Context

The Vietjet Group already took delivery of its first 737 MAX 8 in a September ceremony at Boeing’s delivery center in Seattle. However, it has not yet been operating the type commercially, with its Thai subsidiary set to debut the plane later this year. The remaining aircraft will be delivered gradually over the next three years.

The transfer deal for 50 aircraft to Vietjet Thailand was announced earlier in 2025 and formalized at a ceremony attended by both Vietnam’s and Thailand’s prime ministers. Under this agreement, Boeing is also supporting Thai Vietjet with pilot and engineer training, maintenance services, and other technical support to ensure smooth operations.

The Importance Of This Deal

For Vietjet Thailand, this shift toward Boeing MAX jets is transformational. The new aircraft expands the airline’s capacity, enabling it to scale up both domestic and international operations. The MAX’s greater range (up to 3,547.5 NM / 6,570 km, per Vietjet) opens up new route potential across Asia. Its current plan will see the first MAX-8 flying domestically in Thailand on the Bangkok–Chiang Mai route before launching cross-border service to Vietnam in December 2025.

Additional aircraft from the 50-jet order will arrive through 2028, enabling Vietjet Thailand to start new international services across Asia by early 2026. From a sustainability perspective, utilizing SAF-compatible MAX aircraft helps Vietjet align with global efforts to decarbonize aviation. The fuel efficiency and noise reduction could also enhance the airline’s reputation, and possibly its cost structure, as fuel remains a key cost for low-cost carriers.

At the macro level, this deal is part of a larger geopolitical and economic story. Vietjet’s Boeing order strengthens economic ties between Vietnam, Thailand, and the United States, and signals a significant evolution for Vietjet Thailand, from an all-Airbus low-cost carrier toward a more modern, fuel-efficient Boeing-powered airline poised for regional expansion.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1-d-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-24 05:57:19.002459

Nawal Saini, Managing Partner and Head of Renewable Power & Transition, South Asia and the Middle East, Brookfield discussed with Moneycontrol in an exclusive conversation the firm’s growth strategy, boom in corporate demand for green power, the future of wind and storage along with the role of hydrogen, and why he believes India is poised to become a major global hub in renewables-related manufacturing.

Edited excerpts:

Q. Let’s start with the big picture. What is Brookfield’s long-term vision for the renewable energy business in India and globally?

Brookfield is one of the largest renewable energy platforms globally, with around $140 billion worth of AUM across solar, wind, hydro, pumped storage, battery storage, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture. We operate in over 50 countries across five continents, and what distinguishes us is the diversity of technologies and markets we operate in.

Three global forces are driving our growth — decarbonisation, de-globalisation and digitalization. Renewables and energy transition sit at the centre of all three. Clean energy is the cheapest form of energy. AI and data centres need vast amounts of power, which can be provided at scale by green power.

In India, our AUM is about $32 billion across infrastructure, renewable power & transition, real estate and private equity. When we began our renewables business here around 2018, we had roughly 300 MW of operating renewables. Today the portfolio is around 45 GW. Around 11–12 GW is operating, and 3 GW is coming online this year — which is nearly 10 percent of India's incremental power capacity. Next year the number is even bigger. We achieve this through our platforms, be it structured equity deals like Avaada, acquisitions like Cleanmax and Leap Green, and ground-up platforms like Evren, where we have committed over a billion dollars.

Q. How do you think about returns across acquisitions, greenfield projects and exits?

Our return philosophy is consistent, but the deployment strategy varies. After COVID, we raised $15 billion for the Brookfield Global Transition Fund I - then the world's largest transition fund. We since launched Brookfield Global Transition Fund II (BGTF II), which raised $20 billion in fund commitments and strategic capital, surpassing its predecessor to become the world’s largest private fund dedicated to the clean-energy transition. Recognizing the large and growing demand for decarbonisation solutions in emerging economies, Brookfield is doubling down on its presence in scaled emerging economies through the Brookfield-managed Climate Transition Fund (CTF), backed by a $1 billion commitment from ALTÉRRA to catalyze up to $5 billion for clean energy and transition investments.

A key element of these funds is additionality — fresh capacity creation. That’s why in India a large share of our capital goes into greenfield development: land, connectivity, PPAs and construction. At the same time, India has matured enough to allow capital recycling. We sold around 1.6 GW earlier this year, and with Cleanmax preparing for a public listing, more liquidity creation is likely. We back businesses that generate yield and also provide exit pathways for our LPs.

Q. Where is renewable-power demand coming from today — government discoms or corporates?

Both. Roughly 75 percent still comes from discoms, but the biggest structural shift is the explosion in corporate demand. Ten years ago, IPPs had to convince corporates to buy green power. Today corporates demand it. Boardrooms have taken clear net-zero positions. Export competitiveness now requires clean energy. And renewable power is simply the cheapest form of power, driving business competitiveness. Increasingly, manufacturers set up new projects in states where they can access green open-access power. That’s a fundamental behavioural shift in India’s industrial landscape.

Q. Solar has been the backbone of India’s renewable transition. How do you see wind, storage and other technologies evolving?

Solar will remain the dominant technology because it is mature, cost-competitive and quick to construct. But wind has a major role, especially for round-the-clock renewable supply. Solar peaks in the day; wind peaks in the evening. Batteries and pumped storage add another layer by giving predictability and dispatchability to renewable power. India will need over 300 GWh of battery storage over the next five to seven years, and as storage grows, renewable energy starts to behave more like baseload.

Q. Given the expected wind upcycle, are you actively evaluating acquisitions in that segment?

We evaluate every transaction. We play to our strength of being owner-operators and providing our portfolio companies the benefit of our scale, be it in the form of access to efficient capital, supply chain and procurement efficiencies or global corporate relationships. We can acquire platforms like Cleanmax and Leap Green and scale them or build large platforms from scratch like Evren. We focus on situations where our capital and operating expertise can accelerate growth.

Q. Several assets are currently on the block. How do you view valuations?

Valuation is always an art. The winning bidder pays the highest price, but that does not mean the value is wrong. They may have a competitive angle others don’t — maybe a PPA pipeline or the ability to contract an uncontracted asset. Different investors want different risk profiles: de-risked assets or under-construction assets. That diversity is healthy for the ecosystem and helps capital rotate.

Q. Earlier the big concern was PPAs not being honoured. Has that chapter closed?

Yes. India has moved beyond that phase. The sophistication of regulation here is world-class. Disputes happen everywhere in the world, but India has strong redressal mechanisms. After the LPS rules and court interventions, payment behaviour improved significantly. Large-scale private-sector capacity addition wouldn’t be possible if PPA sanctity were still a real concern.

Q. What about the recent noise on cancelled bids?

The government has clarified that. In India, stakeholders are heard, and better sense prevails. That clarity helps the sector move forward.

Q. How are you evaluating the green hydrogen and green ammonia opportunity?

We have been hearing about hydrogen for three to four years, and now with SECI issuing 15- to 20-year green ammonia contracts, the visibility is improving. These long-term contracts are essential to build the sector. India has strong natural advantages — some of the world’s cheapest renewable power, and strategic proximity to Japan and South Korea, which are major future buyers of green molecules. Hydrogen will scale the way solar scaled: slow at first, then rapidly once project structures mature. India also has an energy-security angle because green molecules reduce import dependence and save foreign exchange. Over time, this will add to the renewable-capacity requirements even further.

Q. Are you seriously evaluating investing in hydrogen?

We are constantly evaluating opportunities, including in partnership with molecule-side specialist. Hydrogen requires aligning electrons and molecules, which means additional technical complexity. But since 50 to 70 percent of hydrogen’s cost is renewable power — and that is what we are experts at. We will not take binary risks. We need a bankable contract, land, interconnect and tied-down project costs. If those fall into place, we can move quickly. Over the next three to four years, I expect us to be doing something meaningful in this space, maybe earlier.

Q. Are you using global learnings for this?

Absolutely. We evaluate hydrogen opportunities globally in Europe, the US and other markets. The learnings — contracting mechanisms, risk allocation, cost structures — are institutionalised within the firm. Those insights flow to India continuously and shape how we think about timing and execution.

Q. How are you approaching Make in India for renewables?

We were early movers. When we invested in Avaada, part of the capital went directly into setting up their manufacturing business. Avaada is now building nearly 8.5 GW of module capacity and 6 GW of cell capacity. Five years ago, India had only module assembly. Today we have cell and module lines, glass manufacturing is coming up, and backward integration is accelerating. In five years, India will likely have wafer and ingot capacity, and possibly even polysilicon manufacturing. India has the raw materials, the engineering talent and now the policy push to support this.

Q. Is transmission keeping pace with renewable growth?

Transmission tends to lag renewables because renewables are fast to build and transmission is relatively slow and complex. Rajasthan is an example where renewable capacity has come up faster than evacuation. This is not a demand problem — India has demand. It is a timing and infrastructure-execution issue. As storage capacity grows, some of these stresses will ease because excess power can be stored.

Q. What drives your expansion in Andhra Pradesh?

We are present in all major renewable-generating states, and Andhra Pradesh is one of them. We recently signed an MOU with the Andhra Pradesh government to invest up to $12 billion in renewable energy projects across the state. Brookﬁeld will develop, construct, and operate a diversiﬁed portfolio of solar, wind and storage projects. We have already commenced development and construction works for projects worth over US$ 2.5 billion, and we have the pipeline to do more in the state.

Having said that, we are also major players in other states including Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, UP, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. Our ambition is national, and we will keep investing wherever the fundamentals allow us to deploy capital at scale.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2025/11/20251124031601_Nawal-Saini-Managing-Partner-Head-of-Renewable-Power-and-Transition-South-Asia-and-the-Middle-East-Brookfield.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 05:57:56.784789

Existing regulations do not yet set out specifications or enforcement mechanisms for E15, despite the fuel having been authorised under recently passed legislation (AB 30) and used safely across the United States for the past 14 years.

In written comments submitted to CARB, ACE’s Chief Marketing Officer, Ron Lamberty, called on the Board to issue a clear statement confirming that E15 sales are permitted and to publish implementation guidance without delay.

“We urge CARB to move quickly with a clear statement that the sale of E15 is allowed in California, and provide guidance promptly, so California fuel marketers can begin offering the low-cost and clean fuel to consumers immediately,” Lamberty said.

He stressed that E15’s safety and compatibility are already well proven through extensive research by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy, as well as more than a decade of day-to-day use by millions of motorists.

“E15 is no longer a new, untested product. We now have 14 years of safe, real-world use in unmodified tanks, lines, and dispensers at thousands of retail stations,” he added.

ACE is urging CARB to classify E15 as a standard petrol grade, in line with federal treatment, warning that categorising it as an alternative fuel would drive up retailer costs, create confusion for drivers, and weaken the potential air-quality benefits for California.

The organisation also highlighted evidence that much of California’s fuelling infrastructure is already compatible with E15. ACE’s Flex Check tool, available at flexfuelforward.com, helps retailers verify whether existing tanks, lines, dispensers, and hardware can safely handle the blend.

According to Lamberty, “the short answer is there should be little or no cost for the majority of California’s fuel terminals and retailers.”

ACE notes that E15 typically sells for 5 to 15 cents less per gallon than E10, offering direct savings for drivers.

It can cut aviation emissions without requiring changes to aircraft or airport facilities.
EcoCeres Renewable Fuels Sdn Bhd, the country’s first SAF producer, has been supplying commercial-grade fuel from its Tanjung Langsat plant since October.
The facility is capable of producing up to 350,000 tonnes of SAF per year, establishing Malaysia as an emerging supplier of low-carbon aviation fuel in the region.
“To strengthen our commitment, the ministry is working with industry players and the transport ministry to introduce a national SAF blending mandate.","Pasir Gudang: Plantation and Commodities Minister Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani said Malaysia’s first commercial production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) represents a major step in the country’s efforts to reduce aviation emissions and strengthen its position in the regional clean-fuel market, reports New Straits Times.

He said the launch comes at the right time, as sectors that are difficult to decarbonise — especially aviation — face increasing pressure to meet global net-zero goals.

“To achieve our national targets, we must also address high-emission sectors, including aviation.

“Globally, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has set an ambitious goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and SAF has been identified as a key way to reduce emissions in this industry,” Johari said during his working visit to the facility today.

Malaysia has committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 under the Paris Agreement.

SAF is a low-carbon jet fuel made from waste and renewable materials. It can cut aviation emissions without requiring changes to aircraft or airport facilities.

EcoCeres Renewable Fuels Sdn Bhd, the country’s first SAF producer, has been supplying commercial-grade fuel from its Tanjung Langsat plant since October. The facility is capable of producing up to 350,000 tonnes of SAF per year, establishing Malaysia as an emerging supplier of low-carbon aviation fuel in the region.

Those present at the launch included the ministry’s secretary-general Datuk Yusran Shah Mohd Yusof; Biomass and Biofuel Division undersecretary Dr Sang Yew Ngin; EcoCeres co-chairman James Tam; and executive vice-president Dannis Poon.

Johari noted that several national policy documents support the SAF initiative, such as the Aviation Decarbonisation Blueprint and the National Energy Transition Roadmap, which lay out phased plans to cut emissions in the aviation sector and place SAF at the centre of these efforts.

“To strengthen our commitment, the ministry is working with industry players and the transport ministry to introduce a national SAF blending mandate. The plan includes an initial requirement of 1 per cent SAF for flights departing Kuala Lumpur International Airport,” he said.

He also said that securing enough raw materials will be essential.

“Malaysia has identified used cooking oil (UCO) as the main raw material to maximise emissions reduction. Since July 2023, an awareness campaign with Petronas Dagangan Bhd has collected more than 1,200 tonnes of UCO from nearly 66,000 Malaysians at 89 collection stations.

“This shows that households can earn extra income while supporting the circular economy. We must continue expanding our collection network and include other raw materials such as empty fruit bunch (EFB) oil and palm oil mill effluent (POME) oil to meet rising demand,” he said.

EcoCeres’ plant is the first in Malaysia to produce SAF certified under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) for both ICAO’s global emissions scheme and the European Union.

With an investment of more than US$800 million (RM3.31 billion) and over 300 jobs created, Johari said the plant’s wider economic impact will help strengthen the country’s biofuel and biomass sectors.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-11.png,N,,2025-11-24 05:58:34.176893

The newly released COP30 draft text omits any direct mention of fossil fuels, raising alarm among climate advocates and investors. As this softens the language, the net-zero signal, on which companies need a coordinated global message to base their corporate transition planning, is weakened. Observers say the lack of mention of fossil fuels could delay the momentum toward decarbonization in hard-to-abate sectors such as energy, transport, and heavy industry.

With negotiations still in flux, the draft underlined tensions between climate diplomacy and political compromise, leaving businesses and investors in limbo. Businesses may have to intensify internal targets and independently verifiable strategies, rather than rely on international mandates. The development underlined that proactive transition planning and transparent sustainability reporting are increasingly crucial as global climate signals unfold.

US government pullback from climate science fuels boom for private data firms

The retreat of the U.S. government from public climate science and growing political pressure on NOAA and NASA have opened a widening gap that private companies are rapidly moving to fill. Constrained federal programs have led corporations to turn to commercial climate-risk platforms, advanced modeling tools, and proprietary datasets to inform decisions across insurance, infrastructure, agriculture, and energy, among other sectors. This has accelerated the rise of private climate-intelligence firms offering high-resolution projections and disaster-risk analytics well beyond traditional government data.

But the proliferation of for-profit providers has raised significant questions about the privatization of critical climate information. The use of paywalled datasets would reduce access for communities and smaller organizations, undermining what once was considered a public good. As financial and market pressures intensify, many warn that an increasing reliance on unregulated, opaque commercial models could weaken rather than strengthen transparency in the disclosure of climate-related risk. As the U.S. steps away from its decades-long leadership in federal climate science, a central question now emerges: Who will own and control the climate data that will shape resilience?

Companies navigating climate-risk data gaps can leverage ESG tools to make informed, resilient sustainability decisions.

This makes the Boeing 737-8 fully compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), aligning with Vietjet’s commitment to reducing its environmental impact and operating in a more sustainable manner. By embracing these technologies, Vietjet is also ensuring that it remains in compliance with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards for noise reduction and emissions control.

Vietjet’s purchase of 200 Boeing 737-8 aircraft is more than just a fleet upgrade. It is part of a broader strategy to support balanced trade between Vietnam and the United States, as well as stimulate economic growth in both countries. The airline believes that this modern fleet of Boeing aircraft will not only enhance its competitive position within the Asia-Pacific region but will also drive broader regional economic development. The new aircraft are expected to increase the airline’s ability to provide safe and high-quality travel experiences for millions of passengers, ensuring continued growth and success for Vietjet in the years to come.

The addition of the Boeing 737-8 also plays a key role in Vietjet’s efforts to improve its service offerings. The airline has already begun expanding its flight routes, having recently launched a direct service between Ho Chi Minh City and Manila. This new route adds to the airline’s growing network and provides travelers with more flexibility when planning their trips to the Philippines, one of Southeast Asia’s most dynamic and emerging destinations. With five return flights per week, the new service will enhance travel experiences and increase connectivity between Vietnam, the Philippines, and the broader Asia-Pacific region.

Manila, the capital of the Philippines, has become increasingly popular among international travelers due to its blend of history, culture, and modern amenities. Visitors can explore the UNESCO-listed Intramuros old town, a historic district rich in colonial-era architecture, or visit iconic landmarks such as Baroque churches and the bustling Mall of Asia. Manila is a unique destination that offers both cultural exploration and the excitement of modern city life.

Ho Chi Minh City, Vietjet’s home base, is Vietnam’s economic and cultural hub. The city offers visitors a lively mix of modernity and tradition, with landmarks such as Nguyễn Huệ Walking Street, the Notre Dame Cathedral, and Bến Thành Market, one of the city’s most famous markets. The vibrant food scene, with its unique mix of local and international cuisine, further strengthens the city’s appeal to tourists and travelers alike.

Complete Interview with David Stribley

1. What inspired you to co-found HAMR Energy?

David Stribley: We established HAMR Energy several years ago with a clear objective—to help our customers access the low-carbon fuels they’ll need for the future. Our mission is twofold: to accelerate their decarbonization journey and to support them in meeting growing regulatory requirements. We noticed that many fuel users face a significant challenge: they are under increasing pressure to reduce emissions and comply with regulations, yet often lack reliable access to renewable fuel alternatives. HAMR Energy was founded to bridge this gap—by producing low-carbon fuels at scale, at competitive costs, and by ensuring that our customers can transition smoothly to sustainable energy solutions.

2. Question: What did your first pitch to investors sound like, and how did they react to your vision?

David Stribley: Our vision is shaped by the understanding that decarbonization is inevitable, though not a linear journey. Around 30% of global primary energy still comes from liquid fuels—a segment that’s seen little progress compared to electricity, where solar, batteries, hydro, and nuclear have driven major advances.

Sectors like aviation, shipping, heavy industry, and chemicals will continue relying on liquid fuels for the foreseeable future. This presents a huge opportunity, as many customers in these industries now seek support to access low-carbon solutions. That’s exactly why HAMR Energy exists—to help bridge this gap and drive the decarbonization of liquid fuels.

3. You have worked for ExxonMobil. Which lessons from your ExxonMobil days do you find yourself applying to most at HAMR Energy?

David Stribley: Our time at ExxonMobil gave us a strong foundation. Both my co-founder and I learned the importance of executing large-scale, capital-intensive projects with discipline—a hallmark of Exxon’s approach. We also learned to stay customer-focused; there’s no point developing a product that doesn’t meet real market needs.

Equally important is ensuring strong industrial logic—working where the right resources and conditions exist, rather than pushing uphill. And finally, having a deep technical understanding is essential. You must truly know the technology behind the projects you’re delivering.

4. What have been some defining challenges in leading HAMR Energy?

David Stribley: We’ve learned a lot along the way, and our main challenges haven’t been technical. The technology to produce sustainable fuels already exists, and through partners like ThyssenKrupp, we’re working with proven, bankable solutions.

The real challenge lies within the market itself, as sustainable aviation fuel and low carbon methanol remain emerging commodities without an established trading ecosystem. That uncertainty—around pricing, demand, and long-term outlook—makes it difficult to plan. The whole industry is facing the same question: how do you build a Commodity-scale product when the future market is still taking shape?

5. Could you explain how HAMR Energy’s renewable methanol technology works, and what differentiates it from competitors in the market?

David Stribley: Our approach integrates biomass gasification with green hydrogen. This hybrid pathway offers the cost advantage of bio-projects with the scalability of e-fuel projects. It enables us to produce renewable methanol efficiently, supplying multiple sectors—from shipping and aviation to chemicals—while maintaining cost competitiveness. We combine advanced technology with resource advantage. Our Portland Project is based in Australia’s largest forestry region, giving us access to abundant, underutilized biomass and renewable power. Its proximity to a deep-water port strengthens export logistics. This alignment of resource, technology, and location gives us a clear edge.

6. How do you see this technology evolving over the next five years?

David Stribley: It’s a really interesting space. Looking at how oil and gas production has evolved over the past 50–60 years, you can see that once facilities are operational, there’s significant room for optimization—whether it’s switching to lower-cost feedstocks or improving efficiency.

For example, we’re starting to explore how electrolyzers interact with variable energy grids, which presents exciting optimization opportunities we haven’t fully tapped yet. We’re also collaborating with technology companies, like Supercritical in the UK, to make electrolyzers more efficient.

Overall, I expect a lot of innovation around these building blocks, and the real challenge will be integrating them effectively into a single, optimized system.

7. What are the biggest technical hurdles HAMR Energy has faced in developing large-scale low-carbon fuel projects?

David Stribley: While the technical building blocks for projects like this are well-established—gasification, electrolysis, and methanol production have all been around for decades—the bigger challenges lie in the commercial side.

Specifically, it’s about securing offtake agreements in emerging markets. There are customers interested, but giving them the confidence to commit long-term is difficult when the market outlook for 2035–2040 is still uncertain.

The real challenge is integrating the commercial and technical elements—they must work together. It’s not just about perfecting the technology; the technical and commercial aspects need to align seamlessly for the project to succeed.

8. Tell us about the Portland Renewable Fuels Project, its significance, and how it will influence local jobs and regional development.

David Stribley: The Portland project is our flagship low carbon methanol development and one of the largest low-carbon fuel projects in Australia. When completed around 2030, it will produce 300,000 tonnes of green methanol annually, using second-generation lignocellulosic biomass and green hydrogen. If used as a fuel, it will abate over 320,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.

What makes the Portland project unique is its positive impact on regional communities. Since biomass feedstock is sourced locally, it supports regional economies, creating about 80 full-time jobs across forestry, transport, port, and export sectors, and over 200 jobs during construction.

The project is versatile, capable of decarbonizing multiple sectors, including maritime—where many vessels are now dual-fuel methanol—chemical industries such as adhesives, and aviation through our methanol-to-jet plant. Its scale, technological approach, and regional benefits make it a major milestone in Australia’s low-carbon fuel transition.

9. HAMR Energy plans to build Australia’s first large-scale methanol-to-jet fuel facility. How will this transform aviation?

David Stribley: Our methanol-to-jet project builds on Portland’s foundation. It uses a hub-and-spoke model, centralizing upgrading where demand is strongest—such as Melbourne. This modular approach allows us to scale production in line with aviation’s gradual adoption of SAF, ensuring flexibility and resilience as the market matures.

10. What key partnerships have enabled HAMR Energy to scale?

David Stribley: We believe partnerships are critical in this space. For our gasification-to-methanol project, we’ve partnered with Thyssenkrupp Uhde in Germany as our primary licensor, and we’ve recently completed pre-FEED with them. Feedstock supply is also essential, so we’ve partnered with forestry companies including one of Australia’s largest One Forty One, which has assets across Australia and New Zealand.

We’re also working closely with Honeywell on our Methanol-to-Jet process, and hope to announce offtake partnerships soon. For us, partnerships must create mutual value—together, we can achieve more than we could separately. If a partner doesn’t benefit, the relationship isn’t meaningful. In this sector, strong, value-driven collaborations are vital to success.

11. How do you see initiatives like the Cleaner Fuel Program shaping the renewable fuel sector in Australia and Asia-Pacific?

David Stribley: It’s a very exciting time. Over the past six months, we’ve seen significant momentum in the sector, driven by both government support and growing market demand. Programs like Australia’s $1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels initiative, the $250 million Low Carbon Liquid Fuels Fund through ARENA, and Hydrogen Head Start 2.0 are clear signals that the government recognizes the critical role of transportation in the region and the need for a decarbonization pathway.

What’s particularly encouraging is that we’re now seeing demand-side drivers as well, including greenhouse gas targets from the International Maritime Organization and sustainable aviation fuel targets across Southeast Asia by 2030. This combination of government incentives on the production side and strong emerging demand creates a substantial supply-demand gap—and presents enormous opportunities for scaling low-carbon fuels. It’s an exciting moment as both sides of the equation begin to align.

12. How do you balance sustainability goals with commercial realities?

David Stribley: At the end of the day, we are a commercial enterprise. While sustainability and decarbonization are important, our primary focus is producing the best product for our customers at the right price.

We see a clear market gap for low-carbon liquid fuels, driven partly by customer incentives and partly by regulatory compliance requirements. Meeting these needs while maintaining commercial viability is central to our approach.

13. How is HAMR Energy preparing for potential market disruptions or shifts in technology?

David Stribley: Early in our strategy, we chose methanol because of its versatility across multiple markets. For example, our methanol-to-jet plant could face low demand in aviation during events like a pandemic, but at the same time, shipping demand might surge. Having multiple, decoupled markets provides strategic resilience and helps manage market risks.

Methanol also benefits from a strong existing fossil-based market, giving a stable underpinning while the low-carbon sector scales. Additionally, our customers make long-term investment decisions—vessel operators, for instance, may order ships today that won’t be delivered until 2028 and will operate for 25+ years. Our designs need to be robust for current and future technologies, such as electrolyzers, while reflecting long-term macro drivers and capital deployment trends that will persist into the 2040s.

14. Where do you see the greatest opportunities and risks for renewable energy development in Australia and Asia Pacific region over the next five years?

David Stribley: Our greatest opportunity—and risk—is timing. Regions like Australia have a unique advantage: abundant, underutilized biomass and access to renewable power, combined with proven technology. This gives us everything needed to develop low-carbon liquid fuels at scale.

The risk is moving too slowly. By 2030, demand for sustainable aviation fuel and IMO targets for shipping will ramp up significantly. If Australia doesn’t act quickly, we risk missing the chance to establish a local low-carbon fuels market, losing both economic opportunity and potential GDP benefits. Delaying action means others will fill the gap, and we’ll end up paying the cost as consumers without capturing the economic upside. Timing is critical.

15. What advice would you give emerging entrepreneurs in clean energy, and should future founders focus on technical innovation, industry networking, or both?

David Stribley: First and foremost, start with your customers. You can have the best idea in the world, but if it doesn’t solve a real problem or meet a genuine need, it will remain just an idea. Talk to your customers—understand what they want, the challenges they face, and how you can support them through the energy transition. It’s important to recognize that this transition is complex and uncertain for many businesses, so patience and empathy are essential.

Perseverance and patience are also key. The energy transition isn’t a straight path—it will have ups and downs. What matters is staying committed to the direction we’re heading, celebrating small wins, and learning from the setbacks along the way.

Finally, I’d say industry networking is just as important as technical innovation. While new technologies will continue to emerge, much of what we need to decarbonize already exists today. What we need now is stronger collaboration, customer engagement, and real-world deployment. Networking helps align solutions with market needs—because without customer offtakes and partnerships, the transition simply won’t happen.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-24 01:56:49.786490

According to the IBA, India currently burns around 7.3 million tonnes of paddy straw, mostly in North Indian states. But the association says this same amount of straw can be used to produce Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG) worth about INR 270 crore (USD 30.2 million) every year.

In a statement, the IBA said the latest anaerobic digestion technologies can “efficiently convert this agricultural residue into Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG), which can directly replace imported natural gas”, as quoted by the Press Trust of India.

The association also pointed out that paddy straw is rich in cellulose, nearly 40 percent, which makes it suitable for producing bioethanol. It claimed that this can help India achieve import substitution worth INR 1,600 crore. Even the remaining part, which is lignin, can be turned into “high-value products, such as polymers, activated carbon, Graphene and resins”. Renewable energy is a huge part of India’s ambitious goal. The country said it is planning a massive clean energy investments of USD 150 billion by 2030.

India, in January 2026, is scheduled to host the 4th edition of India Energy Week, drawing in over 75,000 energy professionals from over 12 countries. The mega assembly will take place in Goa from January 27 to 30.

IBA Chairman Gaurav Kedia said the upcoming biogas policy could give a big push to the sector. “This policy is likely to attract investments of Rs 37,500 crore and facilitate the setting up of 750 CBG projects in the country by 2028-29. More significantly, this represents an import-substituting move toward LNG, ensuring savings in precious foreign exchange by building energy security from domestic resources. Parallel goals of Sustainable Aviation Fuel include 1 per cent blending for international flights by 2027, further expanding the bioeconomy landscape,” he said.

The association stressed that the way paddy straw is seen today needs to change. It said farmers burning the residue cause big pollution spikes every year. “The conventional perception of paddy straw as waste represents a failure of imagination,” it said, adding that burning one tonne of straw releases about 1,460 kg of carbon dioxide, 60 kg of carbon monoxide and 3 kg of particulate matter into the atmosphere.

IBA says India must adopt innovative technologies so that the straw becomes a resource instead of a pollutant. It also said that some solutions are already visible, including strategic plantation around North Indian cities and highways. Mature trees can absorb around 22 kg of CO2 every year and filter particulate matter, giving a natural shield against pollution.

Citing Delhi as an example, the IBA said the capital has shown what large-scale greening can do, planting more than 2.5 million saplings in 2023. It added that Miyawaki forests, highway green corridors and community “Adopt a Tree” programmes together can create a strong natural defence system for cities.

Around 11–12 GW is operating, and 3 GW is coming online this year — which is nearly 10 percent of India's incremental power capacity.
Ten years ago, IPPs had to convince corporates to buy green power.
But since 50 to 70 percent of hydrogen’s cost is renewable power — and that is what we are experts at.
Rajasthan is an example where renewable capacity has come up faster than evacuation.","Brookfield is one of the largest renewable energy platforms globally, with around $140 billion worth of AUM across solar, wind, hydro, pumped storage, battery storage, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture. We operate in over 50 countries across five continents, and what distinguishes us is the diversity of technologies and markets we operate in.

Three global forces are driving our growth — decarbonisation, de-globalisation and digitalization. Renewables and energy transition sit at the centre of all three. Clean energy is the cheapest form of energy. AI and data centres need vast amounts of power, which can be provided at scale by green power.

In India, our AUM is about $32 billion across infrastructure, renewable power & transition, real estate and private equity. When we began our renewables business here around 2018, we had roughly 300 MW of operating renewables. Today the portfolio is around 45 GW. Around 11–12 GW is operating, and 3 GW is coming online this year — which is nearly 10 percent of India's incremental power capacity. Next year the number is even bigger. We achieve this through our platforms, be it structured equity deals like Avaada, acquisitions like Cleanmax and Leap Green, and ground-up platforms like Evren, where we have committed over a billion dollars.

Q. How do you think about returns across acquisitions, greenfield projects and exits?

Our return philosophy is consistent, but the deployment strategy varies. After COVID, we raised $15 billion for the Brookfield Global Transition Fund I - then the world's largest transition fund. We since launched Brookfield Global Transition Fund II (BGTF II), which raised $20 billion in fund commitments and strategic capital, surpassing its predecessor to become the world’s largest private fund dedicated to the clean-energy transition. Recognizing the large and growing demand for decarbonisation solutions in emerging economies, Brookfield is doubling down on its presence in scaled emerging economies through the Brookfield-managed Climate Transition Fund (CTF), backed by a $1 billion commitment from ALTÉRRA to catalyze up to $5 billion for clean energy and transition investments.

A key element of these funds is additionality — fresh capacity creation. That’s why in India a large share of our capital goes into greenfield development: land, connectivity, PPAs and construction. At the same time, India has matured enough to allow capital recycling. We sold around 1.6 GW earlier this year, and with Cleanmax preparing for a public listing, more liquidity creation is likely. We back businesses that generate yield and also provide exit pathways for our LPs.

Q. Where is renewable-power demand coming from today — government discoms or corporates?

Both. Roughly 75 percent still comes from discoms, but the biggest structural shift is the explosion in corporate demand. Ten years ago, IPPs had to convince corporates to buy green power. Today corporates demand it. Boardrooms have taken clear net-zero positions. Export competitiveness now requires clean energy. And renewable power is simply the cheapest form of power, driving business competitiveness. Increasingly, manufacturers set up new projects in states where they can access green open-access power. That’s a fundamental behavioural shift in India’s industrial landscape.

Q. Solar has been the backbone of India’s renewable transition. How do you see wind, storage and other technologies evolving?

Solar will remain the dominant technology because it is mature, cost-competitive and quick to construct. But wind has a major role, especially for round-the-clock renewable supply. Solar peaks in the day; wind peaks in the evening. Batteries and pumped storage add another layer by giving predictability and dispatchability to renewable power. India will need over 300 GWh of battery storage over the next five to seven years, and as storage grows, renewable energy starts to behave more like baseload.

Q. Given the expected wind upcycle, are you actively evaluating acquisitions in that segment?

We evaluate every transaction. We play to our strength of being owner-operators and providing our portfolio companies the benefit of our scale, be it in the form of access to efficient capital, supply chain and procurement efficiencies or global corporate relationships. We can acquire platforms like Cleanmax and Leap Green and scale them or build large platforms from scratch like Evren. We focus on situations where our capital and operating expertise can accelerate growth.

Q. Several assets are currently on the block. How do you view valuations?

Valuation is always an art. The winning bidder pays the highest price, but that does not mean the value is wrong. They may have a competitive angle others don’t — maybe a PPA pipeline or the ability to contract an uncontracted asset. Different investors want different risk profiles: de-risked assets or under-construction assets. That diversity is healthy for the ecosystem and helps capital rotate.

Q. Earlier the big concern was PPAs not being honoured. Has that chapter closed?

Yes. India has moved beyond that phase. The sophistication of regulation here is world-class. Disputes happen everywhere in the world, but India has strong redressal mechanisms. After the LPS rules and court interventions, payment behaviour improved significantly. Large-scale private-sector capacity addition wouldn’t be possible if PPA sanctity were still a real concern.

Q. What about the recent noise on cancelled bids?

The government has clarified that. In India, stakeholders are heard, and better sense prevails. That clarity helps the sector move forward.

Q. How are you evaluating the green hydrogen and green ammonia opportunity?

We have been hearing about hydrogen for three to four years, and now with SECI issuing 15- to 20-year green ammonia contracts, the visibility is improving. These long-term contracts are essential to build the sector. India has strong natural advantages — some of the world’s cheapest renewable power, and strategic proximity to Japan and South Korea, which are major future buyers of green molecules. Hydrogen will scale the way solar scaled: slow at first, then rapidly once project structures mature. India also has an energy-security angle because green molecules reduce import dependence and save foreign exchange. Over time, this will add to the renewable-capacity requirements even further.

Q. Are you seriously evaluating investing in hydrogen?

We are constantly evaluating opportunities, including in partnership with molecule-side specialist. Hydrogen requires aligning electrons and molecules, which means additional technical complexity. But since 50 to 70 percent of hydrogen’s cost is renewable power — and that is what we are experts at. We will not take binary risks. We need a bankable contract, land, interconnect and tied-down project costs. If those fall into place, we can move quickly. Over the next three to four years, I expect us to be doing something meaningful in this space, maybe earlier.

Q. Are you using global learnings for this?

Absolutely. We evaluate hydrogen opportunities globally in Europe, the US and other markets. The learnings — contracting mechanisms, risk allocation, cost structures — are institutionalised within the firm. Those insights flow to India continuously and shape how we think about timing and execution.

Q. How are you approaching Make in India for renewables?

We were early movers. When we invested in Avaada, part of the capital went directly into setting up their manufacturing business. Avaada is now building nearly 8.5 GW of module capacity and 6 GW of cell capacity. Five years ago, India had only module assembly. Today we have cell and module lines, glass manufacturing is coming up, and backward integration is accelerating. In five years, India will likely have wafer and ingot capacity, and possibly even polysilicon manufacturing. India has the raw materials, the engineering talent and now the policy push to support this.

Q. Is transmission keeping pace with renewable growth?

Transmission tends to lag renewables because renewables are fast to build and transmission is relatively slow and complex. Rajasthan is an example where renewable capacity has come up faster than evacuation. This is not a demand problem — India has demand. It is a timing and infrastructure-execution issue. As storage capacity grows, some of these stresses will ease because excess power can be stored.

Q. What drives your expansion in Andhra Pradesh?

We are present in all major renewable-generating states, and Andhra Pradesh is one of them. We recently signed an MOU with the Andhra Pradesh government to invest up to $12 billion in renewable energy projects across the state. Brookﬁeld will develop, construct, and operate a diversiﬁed portfolio of solar, wind and storage projects. We have already commenced development and construction works for projects worth over US$ 2.5 billion, and we have the pipeline to do more in the state.

Having said that, we are also major players in other states including Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, UP, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra.

“Malaysia also has the Malaysia Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification, which ensures that every metric tonne of palm oil is sustainably produced and instils confidence in international markets,” he added.

Johari made the remarks to reporters following a visit to the country’s first SAF biorefinery, Ecoceres Renewable Fuels Sdn Bhd, in Tanjung Langsat, Johor.

Earlier reports had raised concerns about the suitability of palm oil as an SAF feedstock, particularly due to negative perceptions among European buyers over deforestation and environmental sustainability.

He said Malaysia, as the world’s second-largest palm oil producer, has an advantage in raw material supply for the SAF industry.

“The SAF initiative is also part of Malaysia’s strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and can be considered a low-carbon business activity,” he said.

Johari added that the ministry has been actively engaging stakeholders and working with the Ministry of Transport to develop a national SAF blending mandate, with plans to introduce an initial one per cent SAF blending requirement for flights departing from Kuala Lumpur International Airport.

“Since July 2023, the ministry, together with Petronas Dagangan Bhd, has organised awareness programmes to promote UCO collection.

“As of September this year, more than 1,200 tonnes of UCO have been collected from nearly 66,000 customers at 89 selected Petronas petrol stations nationwide,” he said.

The Ecoceres plant in Johor is Malaysia’s first SAF biorefinery, with a licensed capacity of 350,000 metric tonnes per year, and began producing SAF last month.

Up to $170 million in funding for renewable fuel and biomethane production in NSW.","REDUCING emissions and underpinning economic growth in the Hunter Valley and the Port of Newcastle are key objectives of the Renewable Fuel Strategy recently announced by the government of New South Wales

Speaking at the Asia Pacific Hydrogen Summit, state climate change and energy minister Penny Sharpe spoke of the importance of the Hunter Valley Hydrogen Hub in addressing the hard-to-abate sectors like manufacturing, farming and transport.

She also spoke about how the renewable fuels strategy would help NSW meet its emissions reduction targets.

Renewable fuels are low carbon alternatives to fossil fuels, such as biomethane, sustainable aviation fuel, green hydrogen, biodiesel and renewable diesel.

Ms Sharpe said a strong renewable fuels sector would accelerate the transition from fossil fuels because these alternatives offered low carbon solutions for hard-to-electrify sectors like shipping, manufacturing, aviation and heavy transport.

“This is a win-win-win opportunity: a win for jobs, a win for fuel security and a win for the planet,” Ms Sharpe said.

She said the government was “boosting local production of renewable fuels to diversify the economy and deliver new jobs, growth and enhanced energy security for our state”.

Ms Sharpe said the Renewable Fuels Strategy “shows our commitment to building a robust and resilient renewable fuels industry right here in NSW”.

She also mentioned the importance of the partnerships NSW had with Japan and South Korea to build and expand export opportunities.

The minister also drew DCN’s attention to the Port of Newcastle Clean Energy Precinct, as it acts as an export hub for clean energy products and technologies, including hydrogen and ammonia.

The precinct is supported by a $100 million Commonwealth Grant administered by the state government.

The strategy outlines 20 actions to boost the state's renewable fuel industry, including:

Expanding the Renewable Fuel Scheme to include biomethane.

Up to $170 million in funding for renewable fuel and biomethane production in NSW.

Funding research and innovation to improve industry capability, including crop research and development trials to test and demonstrate biomass production opportunities in partnership with primary producers.

Supporting the expansion of GreenPower certification to additional renewable fuels and co-products.

The strategy was developed in collaboration with government and industry stakeholders and informed by feedback gathered from the 2024 discussion paper.

It invites collaboration across industry, researchers, investors and communities to make renewable fuels a core part of NSW’s clean energy future.",,N,,2025-11-24 02:57:26.798262

Bioenergy Australia chief executive officer Shahana McKenzie said the Strategy provides much-needed policy direction.
“Renewable fuels are no longer a future ambition for NSW,” she said.
The WA Government announced in mid-October that it would commit $1.2 million towards the development of an Advanced Biofuels Strategy.","The NSW Government late last week released its Renewable Fuel Strategy. What’s involved in the strategy, and how are other states prioritising biofuels?

The Strategy commits up to $170 million in funding for renewable fuel and biomethane production and expands the Renewable Fuel Scheme – which was previously focused on green hydrogen – to include biomethane.

Up to $130 million funding will be provided through the Net Zero Manufacturing Initiative to support emerging technologies and build local manufacturing capacity.

Renewable diesel trials will also be carried out in transport, construction, mining and agriculture sectors, along with crop research and development trials to test and demonstrate biomass production.

Bioenergy Australia chief executive officer Shahana McKenzie said the Strategy provides much-needed policy direction.

“Renewable fuels are no longer a future ambition for NSW,” she said. “Today’s announcement moves them into the mainstream of the state’s clean energy transition and provides the certainty needed for investment, construction and new regional jobs.”

McKenzie said this policy would help build “capability at scale” and be especially critical for sectors unable to electrify quickly.

“Heavy transport, mining fleets, manufacturing, maritime and aviation all need viable low carbon alternatives right now,” she said. “Renewable fuels and biomethane offer immediate, scalable solutions for these sectors, and NSW is positioning itself to meet that demand.”

An Australia-wide commitment

NSW is being praised as a national leader by launching a dedicated renewable fuels strategy, so how is the rest of Australia tracking in its commitment to bioenergy?

The Federal Government announced its $1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels Program in mid-September, forming part of the Future Made in Australia initiative. This is focused on low carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) such as waste materials, biomass, and renewable hydrogen.

Submissions for comment are open until December 19, with the Federal Government seeking input for the framework and key design principles of the program.

The Federal Government launched its National Bioenergy Feedstock Strategy soon after, which will be focused on developing clear, coordinated direction to support sustainable production of bioenergy feedstock.

The WA Government announced in mid-October that it would commit $1.2 million towards the development of an Advanced Biofuels Strategy.

Churchill Capital Consulting and GHD will partner to deliver the Advanced Biofuels Strategy, which will look to leverage WA’s vast supplies of oat, wheat and barley stubble to explore the production of bioethanol and other biofuels.

A comprehensive economic analysis into WA’s biomass feedstocks, supply chains and technology pathways will be conducted as part of preparations.

Queensland has a goal to be an Asia-Pacific hub for biorefining in an effort to enhance fuel security, support economic diversification, and create high value jobs. At the same time, the state is supporting local agriculture to become a $30 billion industry by 2030.

Queensland has also launched biofuels mandates as part of the Liquid Fuel Supply Act 1984 that requires fuel sellers in the state to sell minimum amounts of bio-based fuels such as E10.

Tasmania aims to launch its Future Clean Fuels Strategy in late 2025, while Victoria and South Australia don’t have dedicated biofuels strategies in play. The Northern Territory, on the other hand, is eager to become a leader in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development, which blends with conventional jet fuel to decarbonise the aviation industry.

Ernst and Young was engaged by the NT Government in 2024 to undertake a feasibility study into the development of a SAF industry in the NT.

Australia has demonstrated its commitment to biofuels in various shapes and forms, with NSW the clear bellwether in this space. With this nascent industry proving to be a low-hanging fruit for industrial decarbonisation, expect plenty more biofuels developments on a national and state scale.",https://www.energymagazine.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_353266785-750x492-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 19:56:13.178135

Indeed, according to new analysis by WorldACD, demand from Southeast Asia (SEA) origins to the US was up by +40%, YoY, in October, the highest YoY full-month growth figure this year.
For the first ten months of this year, tonnages from Southeast Asia to the US were up by an average of nearly +26%, YoY.
For some countries, such as Taiwan, it also partly reflects very strong demand this year for high-performance semi-conductor chips, including those used in AI.
In week 46, for example, air freight tonnages to the US from Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia were up by +41%, +60%, +37%, and +62%, YoY, respectively.","Air cargo rates have continued to rise in the lead-up to Black Friday and Thanksgiving at the end of this month, driven by further increases in spot prices from Asia Pacific to the US and Europe, according to the latest figures from WorldACD Market Data, although there have also been increases in intra-Asia tonnages and rates. Average spot rates from Asia Pacific origins rose by +4%, week on week (WoW), to US$4.11 per kilo in the second full week of November (week 46: 10 to 16 November), with tonnages from that manufacturing powerhouse region continuing to increase (+1%, WoW) during this key retail period.

Spot rates from Asia Pacific to the US increased by a further +4%, WoW, to $5.51 per kilo, driven by a recovery from Japan in tonnages (+16%, WoW) and spot prices (+10%) following the one-day national holiday in Japan the previous week, plus rate increases from South Korea (+13%), and Vietnam (+8%). However, average spot rates from Asia Pacific to the US are down, YoY, since the end of April and stand at -11% in week 46, with some of the biggest decreases seen from Japan (-31%, YoY), Singapore (-19%), Indonesia (-19%), Vietnam (-17%), South Korea (-10%), and Hong Kong (-8%).

As highlighted last week, ex-Asia Pacific markets in the final months of 2024, for example to the US and Europe, experienced exceptionally strong demand and a big squeeze on capacity, particularly from China, due to surging volumes of Chinese e-commerce exports. This year’s rates, therefore, face tough comparison figures with last year, and remain relatively high by historical standards.

Air cargo tonnages from Asia Pacific to the US remain significantly higher, year-on-year (YoY), despite the imposition, since April, of higher tariffs and de minimis restrictions on US imports of goods from China and other countries in the region. Although tonnages from China (-2%, YoY), Hong Kong (-16%, YoY), and South Korea (-10%, YoY), remained below last year’s levels in week 46, tonnages from the region as a whole were +6% higher, YoY.

That has been the case for most of the last six months, thanks to big YoY increases from Taiwan and Southeast Asia origins to the US. Indeed, according to new analysis by WorldACD, demand from Southeast Asia (SEA) origins to the US was up by +40%, YoY, in October, the highest YoY full-month growth figure this year. For the first ten months of this year, tonnages from Southeast Asia to the US were up by an average of nearly +26%, YoY.

In contrast, year-to-date (YtD) tonnages from China and Hong Kong (CN/HK) to the US were down by nearly -6%, YoY, whereas to Europe they were up by around +8% – partly reflecting a diversion of CN/HK air exports from the US to Europe and other markets. YtD tonnages from SEA to Europe are down by almost -6%, YoY.

These figures partly reflect a trend for US importers to seek suppliers from other countries as alternatives to China. For some countries, such as Taiwan, it also partly reflects very strong demand this year for high-performance semi-conductor chips, including those used in AI. Air imports from Taiwan have been consistently up by around 30-50% this year, with similar YoY increases from Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, where semi-conductors and other electronic goods and components also form a significant part of air exports.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.
