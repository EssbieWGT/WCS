The USDA raised its forecast for 2025/26 U.S. corn exports by 125 million bushels to the new 3.2 billion bushel benchmark.
While ADM benefits from the increased throughput and record export activity, the company continues to face margin pressure in its processing segments.
Furthermore, the record export figure of 3.2 billion bushels highlights a shift in global trade alliances.
However, this reliance on exports makes the U.S. market highly sensitive to geopolitical shifts.","The American agricultural landscape has reached a historic crossroads this December as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) released its final World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report for 2025. In a surprising twist for a year defined by a massive 16.752 billion bushel harvest, the USDA has significantly raised its corn export projections to a staggering 3.2 billion bushels. This record-breaking demand is effectively mopping up the excess supply, preventing a price collapse and keeping the season-average farm price anchored at a steady $4.00 per bushel.

For the markets, the December report served as a definitive signal that the global appetite for U.S. grain remains insatiable, even as domestic production hits all-time highs. While the sheer size of the 2025 crop initially sparked fears of a ""glut"" that would drive prices into the low $3.00 range, the surge in international buying—led by a recovery in Southeast Asian demand and continued strength in traditional markets—has shifted the narrative toward a delicate balance. This ""Goldilocks"" scenario of high volume and stable prices is creating a complex web of winners and losers across the agricultural value chain.

The WASDE Breakdown: A Record Crop Meets a Record Export Boom

The December 9, 2025, WASDE report will be remembered for its bold upward revision of export figures. The USDA raised its forecast for 2025/26 U.S. corn exports by 125 million bushels to the new 3.2 billion bushel benchmark. This move was supported by a blistering first quarter of the marketing year, where shipments between September and November exceeded 800 million bushels—the highest pace since 2007. This demand surge has forced the USDA to lower its projection for U.S. ending stocks to 2.029 billion bushels, a figure that, while high by historical standards, is significantly lower than the 2.16 billion bushels analysts had expected just a month ago.

The production side of the ledger remains equally impressive. The USDA held its record production estimate at 16.752 billion bushels, fueled by a national average yield of 186.0 bushels per acre across 90 million harvested acres. This massive output has acted as a natural ceiling on prices, preventing the kind of volatility seen during the supply shocks of 2021 and 2022. Market reactions were immediate; while the cash price remains near $4.00, March 2026 futures contracts have found a firm floor between $4.35 and $4.55, reflecting a market that is suddenly more concerned about logistics and delivery than it is about oversupply.

The timeline leading to this moment was marked by a nearly perfect growing season across the I-80 corridor, followed by an efficient, high-speed harvest in October. However, the unexpected variable was the rapid decline in the U.S. dollar during the fourth quarter, which made American corn the most competitive option on the global market. Key stakeholders, including the National Corn Growers Association and major grain cooperatives, have hailed the report as proof of the U.S. farmer’s efficiency, though many remain wary of the thin margins that $4.00 corn provides in an era of high input costs.

Corporate Impact: Navigating the $4.00 Corn Reality

The implications for public companies are multifaceted. For grain powerhouse Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE: ADM), the high volume of corn moving through the system is a double-edged sword. While ADM benefits from the increased throughput and record export activity, the company continues to face margin pressure in its processing segments. ADM recently set its 2025 earnings guidance at $3.25 to $3.50 per share, as analysts remain cautious about the company’s ability to turn high volume into high profits.

In contrast, Bunge Global SA (NYSE: BG) appears to be in a stronger position following the successful integration of its $34 billion Viterra merger in mid-2025. The combined entity now commands a massive share of the global grain handling market, specifically positioning it to capitalize on the 3.2 billion bushel export boom. Despite lowering its full-year EPS forecast to $7.30–$7.60 in October, Bunge’s stock has shown resilience as investors bet on the company’s enhanced ability to route U.S. corn to emerging markets in Africa and the Middle East.

The machinery and livestock sectors are feeling the pressure of this steady-price environment differently. Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) has signaled that the agricultural equipment cycle is entering a cooling phase. With corn prices hovering at $4.00, farmers are hesitant to make major capital investments. Deere’s management recently projected a 15% to 20% drop in large equipment sales for 2026, exacerbated by potential tariff headwinds that could add $1.2 billion in pretax expenses. Meanwhile, Tyson Foods (NYSE: TSN) is finding a silver lining. The steady and relatively affordable corn supply is a boon for its poultry division, helping to offset the massive losses in its beef segment, which recently saw the closure of a major facility in Nebraska due to tight cattle supplies and record-high retail beef prices.

Broader Significance: SAF and the New Trade Map

The 2025 corn story fits into a broader shift in the global energy and trade landscape. A significant portion of the ""domestic demand"" not captured in export figures is being driven by the nascent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) industry. As U.S. biorefineries scale up production to meet 2030 carbon reduction targets, corn-based ethanol is increasingly viewed as a critical feedstock. This creates a permanent new floor for corn demand that did not exist a decade ago, explaining why prices haven't collapsed despite the 16.7 billion bushel harvest.

Furthermore, the record export figure of 3.2 billion bushels highlights a shift in global trade alliances. With Brazil facing logistical bottlenecks in its own ports and Argentina struggling with economic instability, the U.S. has reclaimed its role as the ""reliable supplier of last resort."" However, this reliance on exports makes the U.S. market highly sensitive to geopolitical shifts. Any escalation in trade tensions with major importers like Mexico or China could quickly turn the current ending-stocks ""cushion"" into a burdensome surplus.

Historically, years of record production like 2014 or 2016 led to prolonged periods of depressed prices. The fact that 2025 is maintaining a $4.00 handle suggests a ""new normal"" for agricultural commodities, where higher production costs and diversified demand (biofuels + exports) prevent the sub-$3.00 prices of the past. This structural change is forcing competitors and partners alike to rethink their long-term supply chain strategies.

Looking Ahead: The 2026 Outlook and South American Competition

As we move into the first quarter of 2026, all eyes will turn to the Southern Hemisphere. The USDA’s record export projection for the U.S. assumes that the Brazilian ""Safrinha"" crop will not flood the market in the second half of the year. If South American weather remains favorable, the U.S. may find it difficult to maintain the 3.2 billion bushel pace, potentially leading to a buildup in ending stocks and a test of the $4.00 price floor.

Strategic pivots are already underway. Companies like Corteva, Inc. (NYSE: CTVA) are doubling down on biologicals and seed treatments that maximize yield even in marginal conditions, as farmers look for ways to stay profitable at $4.00 corn. The market opportunity in 2026 will likely lie in ""precision"" rather than ""expansion."" Farmers who can shave pennies off their cost of production will survive, while those who relied on $6.00 corn to cover inefficiencies will face a difficult restructuring period.

Conclusion: A Market in Equilibrium

The December 2025 WASDE report has provided a rare moment of clarity for the agricultural markets. The U.S. corn industry has proven it can produce at a record scale, and the world has proven it is ready to buy that production. The result is a market in a state of high-volume equilibrium—a ""big crop, big demand"" scenario that keeps the lights on for farmers and the supply chains moving for global grain traders.

For investors, the coming months will require a focus on logistics and policy. Watch the performance of Class I railroads like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP), which will be tasked with moving this record 3.2 billion bushels to the ports. Additionally, keep a close eye on trade policy rhetoric as the 2026 election cycle begins to heat up. While the current outlook is stable, the reliance on international markets means that any disruption to the flow of grain could quickly upend the delicate balance the USDA has projected.

Gevo Investment Narrative Recap

To own Gevo, you have to believe sustainable aviation fuel and carbon solutions can scale into a profitable, durable business despite policy and technology uncertainty. The leadership transition to Dr. Paul Bloom looks orderly and does not materially change the near term focus on securing funding for capital intensive projects and managing reliance on clean fuel and CDR credits, which remain the key catalyst and the biggest operational and policy risk in the story.

The most relevant recent update here is Gevo’s Q3 2025 earnings, which showed sales of US$42.71 million and a reduced net loss of US$7.95 million. Bloom’s track record in commercializing renewable technologies and monetizing jet fuel and carbon sits directly against this early revenue traction, and investors will likely watch how execution on new projects and carbon credit monetization progresses against that improving, but still loss making, earnings base.

We have also seen a number of large Japanese corporations that already had investment arms, including Fujitsu, Mitsui Chemicals, TDK, Hitachi and Toyota, launch follow-on funds this year, substantially increasing the total amount of capital dedicated to startup investing. New capital commitments mean Hitachi and Toyota now have more than $1bn in assets under management.

A number of corporate venture units in Brazil are also understood to have closed, including retailer Cencosud’s venture arm, Oxygea, the CVC of petrochemical company Braskem, and Gerdau Next Ventures, the investment arm of steelmaker Gerdau.

A handful of corporate investment units also spun out from their parent companies. JetBlue Ventures, led by Amy Burr, separated from its airline parent and became part of Sky Leasing, an aviation investment management company. Nichola Bates made a similar move for the innovation team she had led at Boeing, taking it out of the aerospace company and joining with the Fifty Group, a transport sector investment firm.

Austrian insurance group Uniqa’s CVC, Uniqa Ventures, also spun out and rebranded as Shape Capital Partners, while Alphabet’s early-stage investment unit Gradient Ventures put distance between itself and its parent company. The move was designed to put Gradient in a more competitive market position for AI deals.

But overall the balance has been towards more corporate venture units being created than closing.

The largest new corporate investment funds created in 2025

Atlantic Vantage Point, €1.5bn

One of the largest new funds was a €1.5bn ($1.8bn) growth fund that is being raised by Atlantic Vantage Point, formerly known as Axa Venture Partners. This is one of the largest growth funds in Europe, where only a handful of VC funds — corporate or otherwise — have passed the $1bn threshold.

AVP started as Axa’s corporate investment arm in 2016 and then opened the fund to external limited partners from 2020. Axa is still an anchor investor in AVP and is understood to have committed $750m to the new fund. The European Investment Fund also joined as an anchor investor.

Gyeongbuk–Posco Innovation Growth Venture Fund, $730m

Another regional fund anchored by a large corporate investor was born in South Korea, where steel manufacturer Posco joined forces with Gyeongbuk province and four regional city governments to create an investment fund to back regional startups. It is the first time a large corporation has joined one of South Korea’s regional funds as an anchor. The fund is expected to focus on strategic industries such as advanced materials, secondary batteries, AI-driven manufacturing and green energy technologies.

MC Global Innovation, $700m

Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi set up one of the largest new CVC units of the year when it created MC Global Innovation, allocating $700m to the vehicle. MCGI will invest from Mitsubishi’s balance sheet rather than from a dedicated fund but still represents a new focus and organisation to Mitsubishi’s investment activities. Before this, the company tended to just make ad hoc startup investments. Keeping up with the rapid advance of AI is one of the motivating factors for setting up the unit.

Sinopec hydrogen fund, $690m

China went large on hydrogen investment, with state-run oil and gas company Sinopec launching a 5 billion yuan ($690 million) CVC fund to invest in hydrogen energy startups. The fund will be managed by the Sinopec Capital subsidiary Sinopec Equity Fund Management.

China is the world’s leading producer of hydrogen and the government is pushing adoption of the technology, for example by funding the build-out of hydrogen fuelling stations.

Tokyo Invention Partners, $670m

Another large new fund came courtesy of Toyota, which not only committed another $800m to Woven Capital, doubling the size of its growth fund, but also created a completely new unit called Tokyo Invention Partners. This evergreen investment fund, with $670m in capital, will focus on backing early-stage startups in Japan.

Krafton-Naver-Mirae Asset Unicorn Growth Fund, $669m

South Korean gaming studio Krafton is launching an India-focused investment fund worth around $669m, in partnership with South Korean internet company Naver and South Korean financial services company Mirae Asset.

Krafton has long considered India its critical market and is believed to have invested more than $200m in the country’s startup ecosystem to date, mainly in social media and gaming companies. The new fund will take that commitment up another notch. Naver, on the other hand, has not be an active investor in India so far.

Sanofi-Cathay Pharmaceutical Innovation Fund, $275m

French pharmaceutical and healthcare firm Sanofi partnered with investment firm Cathay Capital to launch a $275m fund which will invest in clinical-stage drugs in China. Sanofi has had a partnership with Cathay since 2020, aimed at strengthening its position in China.

Later in the year, Sanofi also committed a further $625m to its main Sanofi Ventures investment fund, increasing the total capital to $1.4bn. Jason Hafler, the managing director at Sanofi Ventures, said new opportunities arising from AI were a key reason that the company wanted to increase its firepower.

Sanofi has been in a fortunate position to be able to reinvest in its CVC activities, as last year three of its portfolio companies were acquired for a total of $3.25bn, including the $1.4bn purchase of Alzheimer’s disease drug developer Aliada Therapeutics by AbbVie.

International Airlines Group, $210m

International Airlines Group set up a new, revamped venture fund with $200m in capital to spend over the next five years. While the British Airways parent company had already been taking minority stakes in startups over the years, there was no set fund size or cadence to the investments. Nacho Tovar leads the new fund, which will focus on tools such as AI and IoT that could help improve airline operations, as well as on sustainable aviation fuel.

Aviva Investors Venture & Growth Capital, $185m

Insurance and financial services group Aviva’s asset management business launched a venture capital fund with £150m ($185m) from its parent company. The fund is set up as an evergreen structure and will target four distinct areas: financial and insurance technology, healthtech, science and technology, and climate and sustainability. It will invest in the UK, North America and Europe, with a distinct bias towards the UK, where the corporate is based.",https://globalventuring.com/content/uploads/2025/12/new-CVC-units.png,N,,2025-12-25 09:11:43.243357

If adopted, this updated guidance provides much-needed confidence that companies can use certificates to help reduce business travel emissions reduction.
One of our main requests was for explicit, lasting recognition of SAF book-and-claim as a valid reduction.
However, the draft guidance does not clearly name SAF, which could create unnecessary confusion.
More flexible guidance is needed so companies can buy SAF certificates regardless of where they travel.","Reducing emissions linked to aviation is challenging. Unlike road transport for example, there are no scalable alternatives such as electric alternatives today; making Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is the only viable near-term technology solution.

Many roadblocks however remain to make SAF affordable and available at scale. GBTA’s latest Acceleration Challenge results show that only 15% of companies currently purchase SAF, mainly because of unclear rules, and higher costs. This makes strong, consistent guidance from SBTi even more important to help unlock demand.

SBTi’s new draft guidance: a positive step forward

The Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) has released new draft guidance that could make it easier for companies to reduce emissions from business travel. For the first time, SBTi formally acknowledges that companies can use the environmental benefits of SAF purchased through a book-and-claim system, called SAF environmental attributes certificates, to help meet their climate targets. If adopted, this updated guidance provides much-needed confidence that companies can use certificates to help reduce business travel emissions reduction.

This is an encouraging signal for travel programs looking for practical, near-term climate solutions. It also reflects growing trust in SAF as a credible way to cut aviation emissions.

GBTA’s key priority is reflected

Earlier this year, GBTA submitted a Position Statement to SBTi on behalf of corporate travel buyers. One of our main requests was for explicit, lasting recognition of SAF book-and-claim as a valid reduction. The draft guidance moves strongly in this direction. At the same time, some important details still need to be clarified to ensure companies can act confidently and that SAF demand isn’t slowed.

GBTA advocating on behalf of the industry

GBTA is submitting a full response to the SBTi consultation to ensure that the interests of the business travel community are represented. We worked with our Sustainability Partners to develop clear, practical recommendations grounded in real-world travel program experience and the realities of today’s SAF market.

What Corporate Buyers Need to Know

Where We See Progress

SBTi has taken an important step by recognizing that companies can buy certificates linked to low-carbon fuels to help reduce their travel emissions. However, the draft guidance does not clearly name SAF, which could create unnecessary confusion. A simple, explicit reference to SAF would make it easier for companies to act with confidence.

Where More Clarification is Needed

Clear rules for companies with existing climate targets: SBTi plans to introduce its updated rules in 2028, but it’s not clear whether companies can start using the rules introduced in this version before then. We are urging SBTi to make it clear that companies can apply the new guidance, specifically for SAF, to their current targets so momentum is not lost.

Clarity on the long-term role of book-and-claim: SBTi still treats book-and-claim as a temporary solution, without explaining whether companies can rely on it long-term. Both companies and fuel producers need stable, predictable rules to sign multi-year SAF deals and unlock new supply.

New concepts that don’t match today’s SAF reality: Some of the new concepts introduced in the draft, such as buying certificates “close to where emissions occur”, don’t work for SAF today, because SAF is only produced in a few locations worldwide. More flexible guidance is needed so companies can buy SAF certificates regardless of where they travel.

Recognition for company-owned or charter flights: For companies that charter flights or run their own aircraft, using book-and-claim is often the only practical way to reduce emissions. We are asking SBTi to formally recognize this so that SAF investments are not limited to commercial travel.

Consistent, simple, global rules: Lastly, SBTi’s principles around accuracy and transparency are important, but they must be applied in a way that works with today’s SAF tracking systems. Overly complex rules could slow adoption instead of accelerating it. SBTi should align with established experts such as RSB and ISCC to ensure consistency across the industry.

Progress, not perfection should be the guiding principle

The latest SBTi draft marks meaningful progress for corporate business travel decarbonization, bringing much needed recognition of SAF environmental attribute certificates as a valid mechanism for meeting Science Based Targets.

For companies looking to take practical next steps, GBTA’s SAF Playbook for Corporates offers simple, actionable guidance on how to assess, budget for, and purchase SAF certificates through book-and-claim.

GBTA will continue championing the needs of travel buyers as these standards evolve.",https://www.4hoteliers.com/ogm/4Hoteliers_Logo.jpg,N,,2025-12-25 09:11:49.427580

In 2026, the UK’s blend of historic trading expertise, technological innovation, regulatory agility, and exceptional talent will ensure its continued importance in the global ecommerce landscape.","The United Kingdom has long been a gateway for global trade, and as we look ahead to 2026, its importance to the world of ecommerce is only set to grow. From its historic trading roots to its thriving technology sector and resilient workforce, the UK—especially London—offers a unique blend of assets that position it as a powerhouse for digital commerce.

The UK’s status as an island nation with a rich history of import and export has always made it a vibrant hub for commerce. London Heathrow, one of the largest airports in Europe, continues to play a pivotal role, serving as the UK’s top port for both exports and imports. The prospect of a third runway only strengthens its future potential as a logistics and distribution centre. But it’s not just about physical infrastructure. The UK has leveraged its technology industry to become a digital services powerhouse, providing the perfect ecosystem for global ecommerce.

London alone is home to 28 ecommerce unicorns and more than 11,500 ecommerce companies, according to Grow London. This concentration of innovation and entrepreneurial energy is a key reason why leading logistics providers, such as Spring GDS, have invested heavily in the UK, expanding operations and establishing major hubs in the capital.

Recent years have tested the resilience of UK ecommerce. The complexities of Brexit and shifting global regulations have forced businesses to become more agile and adaptable. Rather than retreat, many UK-based ecommerce providers have embraced these challenges, developing robust strategies to maintain continuity in cross-border trade. This mindset has proven invaluable as companies navigate new hurdles, such as evolving US tariffs and complex customs requirements. Research from Cap Gemini shows that 59% of British respondents plan to upgrade or expand manufacturing capabilities in the UK and Europe by 2028—a testament to the country’s commitment to growth and innovation. The UK’s strong historic ties, particularly with the US, continue to attract commercial activity and investment, reinforcing its role as a bridge between markets.

Behind every successful ecommerce delivery is a team of talented individuals. The UK’s world-class university system and vibrant tech scene—epitomised by London’s “Silicon Roundabout”—ensure a steady pipeline of skilled professionals. Companies like Spring GDS are harnessing this talent, investing in artificial intelligence, automation, and real-time decision-making tools to optimise supply chains and enhance customer experience. Moreover, the UK’s relatively competitive labour laws and a culture of staff empowerment foster high engagement and innovation. At Spring GDS, for example, a Dutch-inspired approach to autonomy and direct feedback has resulted in a 95% staff engagement rate, demonstrating that a happy workforce is key to delivering reliable and sustainable services.

In 2026, the UK’s blend of historic trading expertise, technological innovation, regulatory agility, and exceptional talent will ensure its continued importance in the global ecommerce landscape. By fostering creative problem solvers and investing in future-ready infrastructure, the UK is not just keeping pace with change—it’s setting the standard for what ecommerce can achieve.",https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/10/19/10/City%20Voices.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,N,,2025-12-25 09:12:16.345341

Significant concentrations of atmospheric chloramines, reaching several hundred parts per trillion (ppt), were consistently observed in both megacities.
When incorporated into a box model, this mechanism successfully reproduced approximately 64% of the diurnal variation in atmospheric NCl3.

While primary chloramines contribute directly to chlorine radical production, secondary chloramines act as vital intermediates in the conversion of Cl2 to radicals.","Chlorine radicals (Cl·) profoundly affect atmospheric oxidation capacity. Chloramines, especially trichloramine (NCl3), are emerging precursors of Cl·. However, their sources and roles in the atmosphere remain elusive. Recently, a research team led by Professor Jiang Jingkun from the School of Environment at Tsinghua University, in collaboration with multiple domestic and international institutions, has elucidated the sources, sinks, and transformation processes of atmospheric chloramines. By integrating atmospheric observations, machine learning, and box model simulations, the study quantifies the significant contribution of chloramines to the generation of atmospheric chlorine radicals.

The team first confirmed the ubiquitous presence of chloramines in the atmosphere through field observations. By establishing a calibration method tailored for Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (CIMS), the researchers conducted quantitative assessments in Beijing, China, and Delhi, India. Significant concentrations of atmospheric chloramines, reaching several hundred parts per trillion (ppt), were consistently observed in both megacities. Analysis revealed two distinct temporal patterns: primary emissions and secondary atmospheric formation. Notably, secondary formation occurred with a frequency of approximately 91%, far exceeding primary emissions and suggesting that secondary processes are a dominant global phenomenon.

Figure 1. Characteristics of primary emissions and secondary formation of atmospheric NCl3 in Beijing during summer: (A) Average diurnal variation of observed vs. simulated NCl3; (B) Time series of a primary emission-dominated scenario; (C) Time series of a secondary formation-dominated scenario; (D) Concentration distribution of NCl3 under different wind speeds and directions.

Utilizing comprehensive data from Beijing and machine learning algorithms, the team identified relative humidity and molecular chlorine (Cl2) concentrations as key drivers of chloramine formation. The study reveals that liquid-phase processes involving Cl2 drive the generation of chloramines, leading to the hypothesis that the stepwise chlorination of ammonia in aerosol liquid water is the primary source.

When incorporated into a box model, this mechanism successfully reproduced approximately 64% of the diurnal variation in atmospheric NCl3. Controlled experiments using Cl2 and acidic ammonium sulfate particles further validated this new mechanism. The findings indicate that higher aerosol acidity (pH 4 to 5) promotes NCl3 formation, explaining why concentrations are typically higher on clean summer days compared to polluted winter days.

This multiphase chemical mechanism fills a “missing link” in the atmospheric chlorine cycle. While primary chloramines contribute directly to chlorine radical production, secondary chloramines act as vital intermediates in the conversion of Cl2 to radicals. Simulation results suggest that accounting for chloramine multiphase chemistry increases the global generation rate of chlorine radicals by approximately 10% to 400%.

Furthermore, the relative contribution of chloramines is negatively correlated with PM2.5 levels, indicating that as air pollution control measures progress, chloramines will play an increasingly prominent role in chlorine radical generation. The study suggests that incorporating these mechanisms into air quality and climate models is essential for accurately assessing the impact of atmospheric chlorine chemistry on global environmental change.

Appendix 1: Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill: Government Response

Letter from Lord Hendy of Richmond Hill, Minister of State for Rail for the Department for Transport to The Baroness Ramsey of Wall Heath, Chair of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.

I would like to thank you and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee for its report on the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill. I am writing to respond to the points raised in the report and the recommendation on Clause 11(4)(b).

Henry VIII powers

The Government agrees with the Committee that there are two Henry VIII powers in this Bill. We apologise for not identifying them in the Delegated Powers Memorandum (DPM) previously. It is now corrected and an updated DPM is included in the Annex of this letter. We are pleased that the Committee agrees with our justifications on using the Henry VIII powers in those two clauses and that they are subject to the affirmative procedure.

Clause 11(4)(b) – determination of turnover

As noted in the report, the DPM had previously stated that 11(4)(b) was subject to the affirmative procedure but this was an error. The Bill as currently drafted states that Clause 11(4)(b) subject to the negative procedure and this is the Government position. We consider the negative procedure is appropriate to exercise the power in clause 11(4)(b) for the reason flagged in our updated memorandum.

The regulations at Clause 11(4)(b) that determine turnover are technical and administrative. The maximum financial penalty is the lesser of £100,000 or the amount equal to 10% of turnover. The maximum amount of the financial penalty can only be increased above £100,000 by regulations subject to affirmative scrutiny. The regulations subject to the negative procedure do not have an effect on maximum amount of the financial penalty.

In this regard, we believe our position is different from the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022 that was referenced in the Committee’s report. It sets the maximum penalty as the greater of £10 million or 4% of the person’s qualifying worldwide turnover. Therefore, unlike our provision, if 4% of a company’s turnover is greater than £10 million, it will result in a larger maximum penalty. In those circumstances, we would agree for regulations setting out how turnover is determined to be subject to the affirmative procedure because it allows Parliament to consider whether a greater maximum penalty is reasonable.

I thank the Committee again for its recommendation, which I know will inform scrutiny of the Bill at Committee and Report Stage. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Florida-based startup Magnifica Air is preparing for a 2027 launch with an original cabin category called Private Class, positioning itself beyond traditional first and business class offerings.

The airline’s ambition is to establish a “middle ground” between commercial aviation and private jet travel—maintaining the convenience and safety standards of scheduled airlines while delivering the quiet, privacy, and calm typically associated with private aviation. As more travelers grow frustrated with crowded airports and high-density cabins, Magnifica Air is seeking to redefine the quality of the travel experience itself.

Prioritising Privacy Within a Scheduled Airline Model

Unlike charter-only operators, Magnifica Air will operate as a scheduled airline. Its fleet will consist of Airbus A220-300 and A321neo aircraft, each configured with just 45 to 54 seats—less than half the capacity of standard layouts.

The A321neo, deployed on longer routes, will feature four private suites, while the A220-300 will serve mid-haul routes with two suites. The remaining seats will not be economy or business class, but high-end recliners, complemented by a bar and lounge area at the rear of the aircraft.

Redefining the Airport Experience

The transformation extends beyond the cabin. Passengers will be chauffeured directly to private terminals, bypassing standard TSA security lines. Check-in will be possible just 30 minutes before departure, with luggage handled by concierge staff from arrival.

Before boarding, travelers will have access to lounge dining and wellness services. Upon arrival, baggage will be delivered within 10 to 15 minutes, with chauffeurs waiting curbside. The entire journey is designed as a seamless, uninterrupted experience—one of the airline’s defining features.

Positioned Between Private Jets and Commercial First Class

Magnifica Air describes its positioning as follows: “Right now, if you want a truly luxurious experience, you’ve got two options: Pay 10 times the cost of a first-class ticket for a private jet, or deal with the frustrations of commercial first-class travel, where you’re still treated like just another number. Magnifica Air is stepping into that space between. We’re offering a fully private, seamless experience for a fraction of what you’d pay to charter a jet.”

While ticket pricing has yet to be disclosed, the airline says fares will vary by route and demand, offering a more accessible alternative to private jet chartering, which can cost several thousand dollars per hour.

Air Quality, Sustainability, and Community

Cabin air quality is a core component of the concept, with aircraft equipped with advanced air-purification systems designed specifically for aviation environments. Sustainability also sits at the centre of the business model: Magnifica Air plans to be carbon-neutral from launch, using more than seven million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) annually alongside carbon offsetting.

In addition, the airline is introducing a membership programme called the Seven Club. Beyond priority booking and fixed pricing, members will receive invitations to curated experiences tied to major cultural and sporting events such as Art Basel and The Masters—an effort to build loyalty beyond the flight itself.

A Highly Focused Network Strategy

At launch, Magnifica Air will connect major U.S. cities, including Miami, New York, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, Dallas, and Houston. Seasonal routes to Napa Valley and the Caribbean are also planned, alongside VIP charters and curated, experience-driven journeys.

Magnifica Air’s vision reflects a broader shift underway in the aviation industry—from competition centred on price efficiency to one focused on experience value. Rather than optimising for seat density or lowest fares, the airline prioritises how time, space, and stress are designed throughout the journey. Positioned between private jets and conventional commercial aviation, Private Class reframes air travel not simply as transportation, but as an experience platform. Whether this model can scale remains to be seen—but it clearly challenges long-held assumptions about what first class is meant to represent.

CBC News reported this week that a proposal for an industrial plant on Nova Scotia’s Eastern Shore has passed its first regulatory hurdle: environmental approval from the province.

The proponent, Nova Sustainable Fuels, backed by European energy giant Octopus Energy, plans to build a $4-6 billion facility to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable ethanol, using solar and wind power and biomass. The company describes the products as “two critical low-carbon fuels for decarbonizing the transportation sector.”

The project would proceed in two phases. The first phase is building a production facility near the mouth of Isaacs Harbour, NS. In the second phase, wind and solar farms would be built to connect to the plant. That, says CBC, would require another environmental assessment, which the company said it plans to submit in 2027.

The jet fuel plant would require 60 truckloads of biomass (wood waste) per day and 586 cubic meters of fresh water per hour, which would be pulled from two nearby lakes.

Related: $60 Oil Is No Longer a Floor

Nova Sustainable Fuels expects it will take two to three years to construct and have a 50-year lifespan. Nova Scotia’s environment minister, Tim Halman, has put a few conditions on the project, including that it must be built within two years.

Nova Scotia has recently turned toward traditional oil and gas sources, despite strategizing a shift from fossil fuels to renewables focused on wind power. In July the province announced it is returning to offshore petroleum exploration for the first time since 2018, offering 13 new parcels covering 3.3 million hectares near the Scotian Shelf.

Energy Minister Trevor Boudreau said offshore natural gas presents a “major economic opportunity”.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, made from sustainable sources such as biofuels, biomass, and captured carbon from oil and gas operations. It is said to cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% and can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure without modifications.

SAF has another Canadian connection in Parkland Corporation, which in 2024 produced the first batch of made-in-Canada low-carbon jet fuel from its facility in Burnaby, British Columbia, just outside of Vancouver.

The 10,000 liters of fuel were sourced from non-food-grade canola and tallow. The entire batch of the production run was bought by Air Canada.

Previously, the Canadian aviation industry purchased SAF from other countries and imported it into Canada.

SAF is being employed at major airports including Amsterdam, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston.

Airlines are collaborating with fuel suppliers, airports and industries like tech and agriculture to boost SAF supply chains. They are also signing multi-year agreements with fuel producers like Neste and World Energy.

Despite these developments, the ramp-up of Sustainable Aviation Fuel has been slower than expected due to high costs and economic uncertainty, putting global clean jet fuel supply off course to reach the 2030 targets, according to a March report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Airlines and airports globally invest just 1-3% of their revenues or capex on SAF, per the report cited by Reuters.

High production costs remain the key barriers to faster adoption of SAF, according to BCG's findings.

Last year, for example, Shell paused on-site construction work at a biofuels plant in Rotterdam amid weak market conditions. The plant is designed to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel made from waste.

In 2023, Willie Walsh, director general at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said that the airline industry would be ready to embrace the fact that SAF would always be more expensive than oil-based jet fuel.",https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/605653485_1344244331062867_1593303863935938262_n.jpg?stp=cp6_dst-jpg_tt6&cstp=mx1320x1695&ctp=p600x600&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=b96d88&_nc_ohc=Po3MGkIxLtUQ7kNvwEqLX0N&_nc_oc=AdmIE07nIcBvcnFfSRn33yOy91jDqvy-k6CuYl6gGPr8EeyoYwdpd6uvyy5G4LIg5zGeLksS7Yi6nxo_nH2dtFaH&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&_nc_gid=hSxo2RA92DlmUL-v0VOZyA&oh=00_AfmnkTOnw4f672CLjjHXSBh1lQ5TxFZ8tfy0RWAeREW8hg&oe=69532FB5,N,,2025-12-25 10:56:41.737535

However, in 2026, SAF production growth is projected to slow down and reach 2.4 Mt.

SAF production in 2025 represents only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption, increasing to 0.8% the following year. At current price levels, the SAF premium translates into an additional $3.6 billion in fuel costs for the industry in 2025. The estimated SAF output for 2025 of 1.9 Mt is a downward revision from IATA’s earlier forecasts due to lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities. SAF prices exceed fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to a factor of five in mandated markets.

Mandates in the EU and UK have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption: In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have widened their profit margins to such an extent that airlines pay up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF. All this comes without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation.

The UK’s SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden. The cumulative impact of poorly designed policy frameworks is that airlines paid a premium of $2.9 billion for the limited 1.9 Mt of SAF available in 2025. Of this, $1.4 billion reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional fuel.

The failure to accelerate the expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets. “Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10% SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” said Walsh.

With e-SAF mandates approaching in the UK (2028) and EU (2030), it’s essential not to repeat the policy missteps seen with SAF. Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel. Without strong production incentives (as opposed to mandates), supply will fall short of targets. On top of that, compliance costs could escalate to EUR 29 billion by 2032 if targets aren’t met, as seems very likely with the current policy framework.",,N,,2025-12-24 17:11:59.370257

As the Middle East strengthens its position as a global tourism hub, it is becoming clear that 2026 will be a transformative year for both airlines and travelers alike.","The Middle East is set to experience an extraordinary tourism boom in 2026 as airlines in the region lead the world in profitability, bringing more flights, better connectivity, and easier access for international tourists. With airlines like Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways posting record profits, the Middle East’s role as a global tourism hub is stronger than ever. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Middle Eastern airlines are expected to report net profit margins of 9.3%—more than double the global industry average. This financial success is poised to positively impact tourism, providing a more seamless and accessible travel experience for visitors.

The IATA forecast for 2026 predicts that Middle Eastern airlines will carry nearly 240 million passengers, with 6.1% growth in passenger traffic. As airfares remain competitive and route networks expand, tourists are likely to enjoy easier access to key Gulf destinations like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. These destinations have long been known for their luxury offerings, cultural attractions, and business opportunities, and now, they are becoming even more accessible to global travelers. The surge in passenger numbers will be fueled by expanding flight routes, more frequent services, and improved airport infrastructures in major cities like Dubai, Doha, and Riyadh.

Aviation Success Fuels Tourism Potential

The United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia are betting big on tourism to diversify their economies, and the aviation industry is playing a central role in making that happen. With expanded airline networks and improved connectivity between countries, tourists will be able to visit multiple destinations in a single trip, often without the need for multiple visas or connections. For instance, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is working on a unified tourist visa, which would allow international visitors to travel between the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and other Gulf nations with one simple visa. This initiative is expected to increase the region’s tourism numbers significantly by encouraging travelers to explore multiple countries during their visit.

Moreover, major airport developments are enhancing the travel experience for tourists. Dubai’s Al Maktoum International Airport is undergoing major expansion, and Saudi Arabia’s King Salman International Airport in Riyadh is set to become a hub for regional and international flights. These infrastructure projects are designed to accommodate a growing number of international passengers, making the Middle East a central point for global air travel.

Long-Haul Flights and Premium Tourism

The rise in airline profitability is closely tied to the continued demand for long-haul flights, which are crucial for tourism in the Middle East. With travelers increasingly seeking cultural, business, and leisure experiences in Gulf nations, airlines are focusing on connecting cities in North America, Europe, and Asia with the Middle East. The region’s airlines, known for their premium services, attract high-value passengers—tourists who are more likely to spend on luxury hotels, shopping, and experiences.

In particular, destinations like Dubai, Doha, and Riyadh are becoming more accessible to international tourists, thanks to stronger connections to international airports. With attractions such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the Louvre Abu Dhabi, and the upcoming Red Sea Project in Saudi Arabia, the region is catering to a growing interest in luxury and cultural tourism. The improved connectivity will allow more travelers to visit these iconic destinations while enjoying the comfort and convenience of international flight networks.

Government Tourism Strategies Align with Airline Success

The governments of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar are aligning their tourism strategies with the expansion of their airline networks. As these airlines continue to grow, tourism ministries are ramping up efforts to market their destinations more effectively. The UAE, for example, has been promoting multi-destination travel packages, encouraging tourists to explore not just Dubai, but other parts of the Emirates such as Abu Dhabi and Sharjah. Similarly, Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 plan has made tourism a key pillar of the country’s diversification strategy, with major investments in cultural heritage sites and luxury resorts. Qatar’s 2022 World Cup legacy continues to shape its tourism initiatives, including more year-round attractions and events.

Challenges and Opportunities for the Future

Despite the positive outlook, the region’s airlines and tourism sectors face challenges. Geopolitical tensions can disrupt travel, and fluctuating fuel prices could impact airline profitability. However, sustainability and environmental goals are becoming key focuses, with airlines and governments investing in green technologies and sustainable practices. Projects such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production and environmentally friendly airport designs are helping the Middle East align with global environmental trends, ensuring that tourism growth remains balanced with eco-friendly goals.

Tourism bodies are also focusing on improving the visitor experience, with initiatives to enhance airline partnerships and streamline immigration processes. These efforts will help minimize travel friction, allowing tourists to have a smoother journey from the moment they arrive at the airport to when they experience the region’s rich offerings.

Looking Ahead: A Thriving Middle East Tourism Hub

The combination of record airline profitability, improved infrastructure, and government support for tourism is creating a booming travel market in the Middle East. Tourists can look forward to more flight options, streamlined travel experiences, and enhanced access to key destinations. As Middle Eastern airlines lead global profitability, tourism in the region is not just about attracting more visitors—it’s about providing them with seamless, luxury experiences that showcase the region’s rich culture, heritage, and modernity.

As the Middle East strengthens its position as a global tourism hub, it is becoming clear that 2026 will be a transformative year for both airlines and travelers alike.

If data from this period were rigidly applied to set future quotas, enterprises could lack sufficient room for production and recovery.
Concluding the meeting, Deputy PM Ha noted that this marks the first time Vietnam has implemented emission quota allocation.
Ha stressed the importance of piloting the allocation of greenhouse gas emission quotas as a crucial stepping stone for completing the management mechanism before nationwide mandatory application.
From 2028, emission quota management will be officially and mandatorily implemented nationwide across all sectors and enterprises.","Hanoi (VNA) – The management of emission quotas will be officially and mandatorily implemented nationwide across all sectors and enterprises from 2028, Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha said while chairing a meeting in Hanoi on December 24.

Reporting at the meeting on the approval of the total greenhouse gas emission quotas for the 2025–2026 period, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Environment Le Cong Thanh said that the 2022–2024 period was heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and post-COVID impacts, which disrupted production chains and resulted in very low production figures at many facilities. If data from this period were rigidly applied to set future quotas, enterprises could lack sufficient room for production and recovery.

Therefore, the ministry has worked with associations, corporations, and relevant ministries and sectors to develop a quota adjustment coefficient. This coefficient is based on three factors: growth targets, emission reduction targets, and the technological capacity of facilities.

Compared with the projected total emissions of plants in 2025–2026, the ministry proposed that the total quotas allocated to thermal power plants be 1.6–2% lower, to iron and steel (crude steel) production facilities 3.8–4.4% lower, and to cement (clinker) production facilities 4.0–4.5% lower.

Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Nguyen Sinh Nhat Tan proposed the establishment of an independent measurement and verification mechanism to ensure the accuracy of emission data, noting that ministries can only appraise processes and cannot precisely verify figures self-reported by enterprises.

Representatives of energy, coal – mineral, cement, and building materials enterprises said that the implementation of emission quota allocation must strike a balance between emission reduction targets and the maintenance of growth momentum.

They proposed shifting the quota allocation method from an absolute approach to emission intensity per unit of product, in order to avoid constraining enterprises that are expanding production and to encourage investment in clean technologies. In addition, enterprises expressed a desire for flexible internal quota coordination mechanisms, along with the early operation of a transparent carbon credit market.

Concluding the meeting, Deputy PM Ha noted that this marks the first time Vietnam has implemented emission quota allocation. The determination of total quotas is based on data on the average output of each facility over the years 2022, 2023 and 2024.

Ha stressed the importance of piloting the allocation of greenhouse gas emission quotas as a crucial stepping stone for completing the management mechanism before nationwide mandatory application.

He said that the pilot phase is not limited to quota figures alone, but is a comprehensive process encompassing the refinement of methods for measurement, accounting, statistics, reporting, and verification, as well as legal and technical issues. These methods must be grounded in a solid scientific basis and aligned with international standards such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

This is closely linked to Vietnam’s responsibilities and commitments under its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), affirmed the Deputy PM.

Regarding the mandatory implementation roadmap, the Deputy PM directed that the period from now until 2027 will focus on piloting in order to comprehensively finalise mechanisms and policies. From 2028, emission quota management will be officially and mandatorily implemented nationwide across all sectors and enterprises.

In particular, he called for the addition of sanctions against violations and data falsification, as well as economic instruments to encourage emission reduction./.",https://mediaen.vietnamplus.vn/images/f579a678cf9e90879541752073c26005dfe538b58f204b7369257ed1e8952f69a1edbfd101a4ad6d8f2f4cbc7e10fc94c131248de17b6dfcc4ab6b83342a1cbf/green-energy.jpg.webp,N,,2025-12-24 11:57:11.581541

“The truth is sustainable aviation fuel is just not to the price level of traditional jet fuel yet without some of these incentives.","Viewpoint: Policy Delays Refocus US SAF Industry

by Matthew Cope (Argus Media) ... SAF output rose to an all-time high of 196mn USG through November of this year compared to 39mn USG in all of 2024, according to US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data. But growth next year is uncertain as the industry awaits final rules on a new biofuel tax credit, nearly a year after the US issued preliminary guidance.

The Inflation Reduction Act's 40B SAF tax credit expired after 2024, ending a minimum $1.25/USG subsidy for producers and blenders of a fuel that produces half as many emissions as petroleum jet fuel. The move this year to the 45Z tax credit for all types of domestic clean fuel production was always expected to be rocky — in part because stricter carbon intensity rules left most types of SAF with less of a tax break than in 2024 — but the market also has been hurt by delayed final rules.

The US government now expects to issue final regulations in the second quarter of 2026, though interim guidance could come sooner. Nonetheless, producers have begun selling 45Z credits at a discount to the book value of the credit. With producers looking for the market to rebound after a year of depressed margins and a drop in SAF values, this revenue stream is expected to become more common in future years but will still hinge on policy certainty.

In a similar fashion, EPA expects to finalize new biofuel blend mandates in the first quarter next year, another delayed regulatory program affecting SAF margins. While jet fuel is not obligated under the program like conventional gasoline and diesel, SAF generates a D4 RIN that is used by refiners to show compliance with the EPA's standards.

...

At the state level, multiple jurisdictions offer tax credits geared toward rewarding producers and airlines that increase SAF usage. The one that has made the most difference in boosting SAF demand is Illinois' $1.50/USG airline tax credit for SAF use. Minnesota has a similar policy.

Washington, Nebraska and, most recently, Arkansas have enacted incentives available to SAF producers within their states. But those states have not produced any SAF that is not co-processed with petroleum fuel and they have no facilities being commissioned, according to Argus estimates.

Uncertainty over federal policy continues to act as a roadblock for SAF producers looking to develop, finance, and bring their products to market in a timely and efficient way.

...

President Donald Trump's attacks on climate change policy has eroded industry-wide SAF demand. SAF prices reached all time lows in December, valued as low as $3.52/USG in the US west coast. But that's still a considerable premium to petroleum jet fuel, meaning uptake will be limited in the US absent new policies. READ MORE

Industry leaders say policy support key to growing Minnesota’s SAF market (Brownfield Ag News; includes AUDIO)

Excerpt from Brownfield Ag News: Lawmakers in Minnesota are expected to revisit legislation that supports the advancement of sustainable aviation fuels.

Minnesota Biofuels Association executive director Brian Werner tells Brownfield the state legislature failed to pass a bill in 2025 that would’ve expanded resources through a SAF tax credit.

“We made a lot of progress on that, but unfortunately that provision fell out at the eleventh hour at the end of last session. So we’re really going to redouble our efforts here in 2026.”

He suggests more state and federal support is necessary to create a sustainable SAF market.

“The truth is sustainable aviation fuel is just not to the price level of traditional jet fuel yet without some of these incentives. So to really get production moving in the state of Minnesota, we need a more stable policy framework to get that going.”",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-12-24 12:57:27.791542

Airlines, governments, and manufacturers across Asia have announced ambitious carbon-reduction targets, placing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at the centre of the industry’s green transition.

Yet behind the announcements lies a hard truth: Asia is not ready to scale SAF at the pace required.

Big Promises, Limited Supply

SAF production remains extremely limited in Asia. While pilot projects and small-scale facilities exist, regional supply accounts for only a fraction of global SAF output.

Key challenges include:

Lack of large-scale SAF refineries

Limited feedstock availability

High production and logistics costs

Competition with other biofuel industries

As a result, most Asian airlines rely on imported SAF, making widespread adoption economically unrealistic.

The Cost Barrier for Airlines

SAF currently costs two to five times more than conventional jet fuel. For airlines already under pressure from rising fuel prices, leasing costs, and aircraft delays, absorbing SAF premiums is extremely difficult.

Low-cost carriers, which dominate Asian skies, face the toughest challenge. Their price-sensitive customers leave little room to pass additional costs onto ticket prices.

Policy Gaps Across the Region

Unlike Europe, Asia lacks a unified regulatory framework for SAF adoption. Policies vary widely from country to country, creating uncertainty for investors and producers.

Without:

Clear mandates

Long-term incentives

Stable pricing mechanisms

SAF production in Asia struggles to attract the capital needed for expansion

Airlines Caught in a Sustainability Dilemma

Asian airlines are under growing pressure from:

International environmental commitments

Corporate travel sustainability requirements

Investor and public expectations

At the same time, limited SAF availability means airlines must rely heavily on fleet modernisation, operational efficiency, and carbon offsetting to meet near-term sustainability goals.

A Regional Opportunity Still Untapped

Despite current challenges, Asia holds long-term potential:

Abundant biomass resources

Strong refining and petrochemical expertise

Growing aviation demand

With the right policy support, Asia could become a major SAF producer, not just a consumer.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel remains aviation’s most promising pathway to decarbonisation, but in Asia, ambition currently outpaces reality. Until production scales up and costs come down, SAF will remain a strategic goal rather than an operational solution.",https://myaviationmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ment-26.png,N,,2025-12-24 09:56:15.911463

Regular use of SAF began last month.

This marks a significant milestone for the airport and for Vinci Airports’ commitment to accelerating the energy transition across its mobility infrastructure and with its stakeholders.

Salvador Bahia Airport already stands as a regional benchmark for environmental performance, according to Vinci.

As the first airport in the Americas to achieve the highest level of Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA 5), it has implemented advanced practices for carbon management and reduction.

Today, more than 15 airports across its network already offer SAF, and the introduction of this fuel into regular operations in Salvador further strengthens this position and aligns with decarbonization goals across the Vinci Airports network, the company stated.

In Brazil, SAF is distributed commercially by Vibra.

The fuel blend used at Salvador complies with international sustainability criteria and can help lower lifecycle greenhouse-gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

Two daily flights departing from Salvador Bahia and operated by Gol Linhas Aéreas and LATAM Airlines Brasil are now supplied with SAF.

They use a blend containing 10 percent pure SAF and 90 percent conventional jet fuel, currently the highest proportion applied in Brazilian aviation.

The pure SAF, produced from used cooking oil, is presently the only one available on the national market.

While emissions from flights fall under airlines’ scope 1 and the airport’s scope 3, this renewable fuel contributes to reducing lifecycle greenhouse-gas emissions compared to traditional jet fuel.

Its introduction at Salvador Bahia Airport represents a concrete first step in expanding SAF use in Brazil’s aviation sector and supporting more sustainable operational practices.

Gov. Jerônimo Rodrigues highlighted that Bahia is already one of the most advanced states in the country in green technologies, especially in the automotive, renewable energy and emerging industry sectors.

“Bahia has made significant progress in clean-energy production and in building a more sustainable future, where development and social justice move forward together,” Rodrigues said. “During our participation in COP30, we made clear that the Bahia government is aligned with Brazil’s stance on the shared responsibility we all have in the face of the climate crisis.”

Julio Ribas, CEO of Vinci Airports in Brazil, which operates Salvador Bahia Airport and seven airports in the Amazonia, pointed out that the regular use of SAF represents another decisive step toward sustainable aviation in Brazil.

“SAF is currently the most effective tool for reducing emissions in commercial aviation,” Ribas said. “Being able to offer flights fueled with SAF in Salvador on a continuous basis places Bahia at the forefront of the energy transition and reinforces our commitment to transforming passenger journeys with increasingly sustainable solutions.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_37105fc2cf35403884e781a8fb771b3b~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_960,h_540,al_c,q_85/80995f_37105fc2cf35403884e781a8fb771b3b~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-12-24 09:56:19.906324

According to the minister, Egypt is maintaining stability in gas supplies through a combination of domestic production, regasification vessels and regional pipeline infrastructure. He noted that locally produced gas is the least costly option, followed by pipeline imports, while regasified gas remains the most expensive source. Egypt currently covers around 72% of its gasoline consumption and 55% of its diesel needs through local production, with plans in place to raise those shares in the period ahead.

He also announced that four new exploration areas in the Red Sea are set to open as part of efforts to expand upstream activity. Badawi said most outstanding dues to foreign partners in the petroleum and gas sector have now been settled, a step he linked to renewed investment momentum.

He added that Apache is preparing to expand its gas investments in the Western Desert following recent pricing adjustments. Looking ahead, the minister cited planned investments of around USD 8 billion by Eni over the next five years, alongside a further USD 3.5 billion expected from ADNOC and BP.

Egypt continues to move forward with reforms under the Extended Fund Facility loan programme, which provides USD 8 billion to support economic and structural changes, including a gradual and transparent phase-out of fuel subsidies to reduce untargeted spending and strengthen social protection.

On regional gas arrangements, Badawi said roughly one billion cubic feet of gas currently flows through pipelines from Israeli fields, a volume that does not meet the bulk of Egypt’s needs. He said additional pipeline connections linking Egypt with Israel and Cyprus, alongside regasification ships, help ensure supply continuity.

Addressing the 2019 gas agreement, the minister described it as a commercial deal involving US-based Chevron alongside Egyptian and Israeli companies, stressing that it is not a political arrangement and that Egypt can rely on its own resources, with gas supplies unable to be used as leverage against the country.",https://cairoscene.com/Content/Admin/Uploads/Articles/ArticlesMainPhoto/1172662/9495ed00-7005-4dc7-ac71-24bae068eee1.jpg,N,,2025-12-24 07:12:12.668407

Cette ligne marque aussi un nouvel élan pour Aircalin, qui va opérer deux A350 à l’horizon 2028. Surtout, la compagnie à l’Hibiscus a voulu marquer le coup sur le volet des réductions des émissions carbone, en emportant 25% de SAF sur le vol Paris-Bangkok-Nouméa : « le deuxième plus long vol au monde et le plus long vol au monde au départ de Paris » avec du SAF, nous précise Yann Genay, attaché à la Direction Générale, spécialiste SAF chez Aircalin.

C’est une première pour un vol très long courrier, surtout au départ de Paris. Le 10 décembre dernier, pour fêter le premier anniversaire de sa ligne Paris-Nouméa via Bangkok, Aircalin a emporté 25% de Sustainable Aviation Fuel, ou SAF (carburant aviation durable) dans ses entrailles, contre les 2% minimum imposées par l’Union européenne. Une démarche environnementale vertueuse, puisque le SAF est un carburant raffiné notamment à partir de l’huile de cuisson usagée ; donc à la base un déchet (pas en concurrence avec un produit créé donc pas de tension sur la production d’huile de cuisson).

Ce SAF, Aircalin se l’est procuré pour ses deux tronçons : à la fois le Paris-CDG vers Bangkok, puis Bangkok vers Nouméa. « Sur le premier, c'est avec notre fournisseur Total qui nous approvisionne en carburant au départ de Paris. On a passé un accord commercial pour acheter l'équivalent de 25% de SAF sur ce vol-là. Le Paris-Bangkok a donc été fourni avec l'équivalent de 25% de quantité de SAF par rapport à la totalité du carburant », explique Yann Genay.

« Total a une raffinerie en Normandie qui fabrique du SAF et ils injectent ce carburant dans le pipeline qui l’amène jusqu'au dépôt pétrolier de Roissy et d'Orly. La quantité envoyée dépend des achats. Ces 25% ont été injectés dans le dépôt pétrolier, mais ils sont bien au crédit du vol Aircalin, puisque c'est nous qui les avons achetés et donc ils sont dans la chaîne d'approvisionnement. C'est le procédé classique d'un aéroport où il y a du SAF physiquement, puisqu'il se trouve mélangé avec le carburant d'aviation classique dans les dépôts d'Aéroports de Paris », poursuit le spécialiste SAF d’Aircalin.

En outre, le SAF fourni aux Aéroports de Paris par Total est doublement vertueux, étant fabriqué en France, avec des matières premières en provenance d’Europe. « C'est pour ça qu'il est crédité d'un excellent coefficient de réduction d'émission de carbone. Son stock de matières premières venant de l'Europe et étant raffiné en France, ça permet une chaîne d'approvisionnement et de traitement optimale ».

Pour son vol Bangkok-Nouméa, Aircalin s’est appuyé sur le constructeur Airbus, qui a mis en place un mécanisme de « Book and Claim ». Celui-ci permet aux compagnies aériennes d’acheter du carburant aérien durable là où il est produit pour le réseau mondial, elles reçoivent en échange les crédits correspondant à la réduction des émissions générées. Ce mécanisme permet à des compagnies comme Aircalin qui n'ont pas accès au SAF sur certaines escales (comme Bangkok en l’occurrence) de s’en procurer.

« Airbus a permis à Aircalin d’accéder au SAF, à hauteur de 25% de la totalité du carburant nécessaire pour le vol Bangkok-Nouméa ; le crédit lié à la réduction d'émission carbone de cette quantité étant attribué à Aircalin sur ce vol Bangkok-Nouméa », résume Yann Genay. « Ce sont donc deux systèmes différents d’approvisionnements. Dans le premier, le SAF est acheminé dans le système intégré de l'aéroport et dans l'autre, le SAF est sourcé sur le marché mondial et est mis sur une route particulière, ici à travers le dispositif du constructeur Airbus. Finalement, le Paris-Bangkok-Nouméa, sur sa totalité, est donc crédité de 25% de SAF » ajoute-t-il.

« Cette opération était fondamentale pour nous » souligne le cadre d’Aircalin. « D'abord, c'est le plus long vol du monde opéré avec du SAF, et on a voulu démontrer que c'était possible de le faire sur du très long courrier, puisqu'aujourd'hui, le SAF est surtout utilisé sur des vols plutôt régionaux ou moyen-courrier, notamment en Europe. 25% sur un vol qui est aujourd'hui le deuxième plus long vol au monde et le plus long vol au monde au départ de Paris, cela n’était jamais arrivé ».

L’opération, visant surtout à démontrer et à marquer le coup pour le premier anniversaire du Nouméa-Paris-Nouméa via Bangkok, ne sera toutefois pas, dans l’immédiat, pérennisée. Pas pour des raisons dépendantes de la compagnie, mais « pour des raisons de coût notamment ». « En Europe, on est plutôt sur un coût de quatre à cinq fois le prix du carburant classique. Ça ne peut pas être fait sur tous les vols, à l’heure actuelle », concède le spécialiste.

Ajouté à cela, l’absence de SAF dans les autres escales de la compagnie. « Dans le Pacifique, en Australie et en Nouvelle-Zélande, il n'y en a pas. Singapour se prépare : c'est en train d'arriver pour l'année prochaine. La Thaïlande y travaille aussi, à priori pour 2027 ». Il faut aussi, précise Yann Genay, que l’industrie mondiale permette à l’aviation de bénéficier d’un SAF plus abordable, « parce qu'avec un prix aussi important, on ne peut pas le faire seul. Ça va peser très lourd dans les finances ».

Objectif : « 15% de SAF en 2030 sur notre réseau »

Pour autant, la compagnie à l’Hibiscus poursuit sa feuille de route de décarbonation, établie en 2023, et dont l’objectif est de réduire de 25% ses émissions de gaz à effet de serre à l’horizon 2030. « Aujourd’hui, on a fait environ la moitié du chemin grâce au pilier 1 de la décarbonation : avoir une flotte d'avions la plus moderne et la plus performante. Les avions de nouvelle génération consomment moins (…). On a déjà fait entre 10 et 15% d'économie de carburant rien qu'en passant des Airbus classiques aux Airbus Neo : A320 et A330 ».

« Le second pilier de la décarbonation est le SAF. Car une fois qu'on a une flotte d’avions modernes et économes, c'est le SAF qui va permettre d’assurer la part la plus importante de la décarbonation du secteur du transport aérien. Et là, on espère d'ici 2030 être capable d’incorporer 15% de SAF au global de notre consommation de carburant sur le réseau d’Aircalin » poursuit Yann Genay. « Cela dépendra de la manière dont l'industrie de l’aviation sera accompagnée pour que le SAF soit plus abordable et disponible. Mais 15% de SAF en 2030 sur notre réseau, c'est l'objectif ».

Concernant sa flotte, déjà jeune et moderne, Aircalin ira encore un peu plus loin à l’horizon 2027 et 2028, avec l’acquisition de deux A350-900 pour assurer ses vols long-courriers. « Tous les Airbus et Boeing, et surtout tous les Airbus de nouvelle génération, que ce soit des 320, des 330 ou des 350, sont certifiés avec 50% d'emport de SAF. C'est-à-dire qu'aujourd'hui, vous pouvez mettre dans tous ces avions moitié-moitié : SAF et carburant fossile ».

« D'ici deux à cinq ans, ils seront tous certifiés à 100%. C'est-à-dire que demain, on pourra faire voler tous ces avions avec uniquement du SAF. Et l’A350 va continuer à nous aider à cette trajectoire parce qu'il est encore plus performant que l’A330Neo en termes de consommation au siège, parce qu'on fait toujours le ratio par rapport à la capacité de l'avion et au nombre de sièges à bord » assure Yann Genay.

En complément des deux piliers principaux de sa feuille de route de décarbonation -le renouvellement de la flotte et le SAF-, Aircalin travaille également sur les « green operations », « c'est-à-dire toutes les opérations qui font que les plans de vol sont optimisés avec les meilleures routes, et les meilleurs niveaux de consommation. On a déjà les logiciels qui nous permettent de le faire ». Un outil important pour la compagnie du Pacifique sud qui, pour relier Paris, doit passer par des routes sensibles, que ce soit en raison de la géographie ou de la géopolitique.",https://odm360-public-files.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-media/uploads/thumbnails/2025/12/1200/thumb_1200x630-481071335-643598094987174-6503310793306191068-n-694bb764d7d37.jpeg,N,,2025-12-24 13:56:40.782028

Recently, the mileage integration plan submitted by Korean Air and Asiana Airlines was rejected by the KFTC for a second time.
In June, the KFTC initially rejected the mileage integration plan, citing insufficient grounds for the proposed ratio.
An industry official stated, “If the mileage integration plan is rejected again, the KFTC’s review process could delay the full integration timeline by several months.
Korean Air must quickly prepare a revised plan to address consumer concerns.” This article has been translated by GripLabs Mingo AI.","Korean Air’s merger with Asiana Airlines is entering its final stages, but the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC)’s prolonged review of the mileage integration plan is emerging as a variable in the airline’s long-term roadmap. The timing of KFTC approval could impact the restructuring of the integrated Full Service Carrier (FSC) network, financial management, and the pace of ESG and decarbonization strategies.

According to the aviation industry on the 24th, Korean Air recently announced plans to fully integrate with Asiana Airlines by the end of 2026 as part of its corporate value enhancement strategy. Following this, the company aims to merge its subsidiaries, including Low Cost Carriers (LCCs), by 2027.

Previously, Korean Air announced its intention to acquire Asiana Airlines in November 2020, submitted domestic and international merger filings in January 2021, and filed a Post-Merger Integration (PMI) plan in March. Since 2022, the company has undergone competition reviews in various countries and made adjustments to slots and routes in the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom.

The core of this value-up plan is not simply expanding through mergers and acquisitions, but fundamentally improving the company’s financial structure, business operations, and ESG across the board.

With the expansion, the integrated FSC is expected to generate annual revenue of over 23 trillion KRW. By early 2027, the fleet will grow to around 230 aircraft, and the workforce will expand to approximately 28,000 employees. The network will connect to about 120 cities, aiming for a 55% increase in passenger capacity and more than a 10% boost in cargo capacity.

This business expansion will enhance both domestic and international competitiveness. The integrated FSC will hold a 37% slot share, and LCCs will hold 11% at Incheon Hub, strengthening its position. The company is projected to become the leading provider between East and Southeast Asia and rank second on Asia-North America routes. Improved network connectivity is also expected to boost transfer demand and maximize the use of Belly Cargo.

ESG strategies are also central. Korean Air is not only introducing eco-friendly aircraft to address climate change, but is also expanding the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and has set mid- to long-term goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

However, some analysts warn that repeated rejections of the mileage integration plan by the KFTC could delay Korean Air’s timeline for full integration by 2026. As the KFTC’s review of supplementary plans typically takes three to six months, another rejection of the third mileage integration proposal could disrupt the entire roadmap.

Recently, the mileage integration plan submitted by Korean Air and Asiana Airlines was rejected by the KFTC for a second time. The commission cited insufficient guarantees for consumer benefits.

On the 22nd, the KFTC requested that Korean Air supplement its management plan for bonus seats and seat upgrade services using mileage, and resubmit it within one month.

In June, the KFTC initially rejected the mileage integration plan, citing insufficient grounds for the proposed ratio. The revised proposal, submitted in September, which included a 1:0.82 integration ratio and a ten-year guarantee for Asiana Airlines mileage value, was also blocked.

Additionally, a 6 billion KRW enforcement fine was imposed for violating the order to maintain seat numbers. The KFTC plans to closely monitor compliance with corrective measures until the end of 2034, aiming to protect the rights of airline consumers.

Declining consumer trust is also emerging as a significant risk. Repeated rejections of the integration plan are fueling concerns over the expiration of Asiana Airlines mileage, heightening dissatisfaction. This could negatively impact Korean Air’s brand image and long-term customer retention.

An industry official stated, “If the mileage integration plan is rejected again, the KFTC’s review process could delay the full integration timeline by several months. Korean Air must quickly prepare a revised plan to address consumer concerns.”

The Global Aerospace And Defense Core Materials Market size is expected to be worth around USD 1595.2 Million by 2034, from USD 474.1 Million in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 12.9% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. In 2024 Asia Pacific held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 43.2% share, holding USD 204.8 Million in revenue.

Aerospace & defense (A&D) core materials—mainly honeycomb and structural foams used inside sandwich panels—sit at the heart of lightweight structures such as nacelles, control surfaces, fairings, rotor blades, radomes, floors, and increasingly, space and unmanned platforms. The value proposition is simple: by replacing “solid laminate” thickness with a low-density core, OEMs and tier suppliers achieve higher stiffness-to-weight, better buckling resistance, and improved vibration/acoustic behavior—without paying the full mass penalty of thicker skins. This lightweighting logic has become more important as modern airframes lean heavily into advanced materials; for example, Airbus notes the A350 is built with 70% advanced materials, including 53% composites and 14% titanium.

Industrial demand for these cores closely follows the build-rate and retrofit cycles of commercial aviation, plus defense modernization and readiness spending. On the commercial side, OEM output is still supply-chain-constrained, but the installed base and backlog keep the materials pipeline busy: Airbus delivered 766 commercial aircraft in 2024 and reported a year-end backlog of 8,658 aircraft, a strong forward indicator for multi-year aerostructure demand. Boeing reported 348 total commercial airplane deliveries in full-year 2024.

Key driving factors are performance economics, survivability requirements, and certification expectations. Weight reduction remains a direct lever for fuel burn and payload/range, which makes high stiffness-to-weight sandwich panels attractive across commercial and military airframes. In parallel, defense demand is structurally supported by rising national budgets and accelerated procurement. SIPRI reports world military expenditure reached $2,718 billion in 2024, expanding the addressable base for military aviation, drones, and protected mobility structures that use lightweight cores. In the U.S., the FY2025 request includes about $850 billion in discretionary spending for DoD military programs, underpinning continued acquisition and sustainment activity.

Government initiatives and trusted public programs also shape the opportunity set—especially where decarbonization and new propulsion concepts drive material redesign. For example, the U.S. FAA opened funding windows totaling $245 million for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) infrastructure projects and $47 million for low-emission aviation technology projects, which helps accelerate fleet transition and aircraft technology upgrades that often require new lightweight structures and thermal/acoustic solutions—areas where core materials are routinely specified.

On the defense side, U.S. national defense budgeting remains extremely large in absolute terms; CRS notes $895.2 billion requested for discretionary activities within the FY2025 national defense budget function, with ~$883.7 billion falling within the scope of FY2025 NDAA proposals/versions—supporting ongoing procurement, sustainment, and modernization demand signals.

Emerging Trends

Tighter Quality Controls and Traceability Are Becoming the New Standard

A clear latest trend in aerospace and defense core materials is the industry’s shift from “lightweight at any cost” to lightweight with deeper proof of quality—meaning tighter inspection, better traceability, and more process control across every layer of a sandwich structure. Core materials work best when thickness, bonding quality, and material uniformity are consistent. As production rates rise and fleets stay in service longer, OEMs and regulators are pushing suppliers to show stronger evidence that panels are built exactly as designed, every time.

This trend is being reinforced by real regulatory actions. In December 2025, European aviation regulators ordered inspections on certain Airbus A320 aircraft after a fuselage panel thickness issue linked to a supplier. The guidance required airlines to check thickness of affected forward fuselage panels within six months, and it applied to 177 in-service aircraft and an additional 451 aircraft still in production. Even though this case is about fuselage panels, the message travels across the materials chain: thickness control, manufacturing records, and repair history are no longer “nice to have.” They are becoming mandatory proof points.

At the same time, aircraft output expectations remain high, so the market is looking for quality systems that do not slow production. Airbus delivered 766 commercial aircraft in 2024 and ended the year with a backlog of 8,658 aircraft. A backlog of that size pushes Tier-1 and Tier-2 suppliers to scale, but scaling without stronger quality control creates risk. That is why manufacturers are investing in more in-process checks—digital work instructions, batch traceability, and non-destructive inspection approaches that can catch thickness or bonding issues early, before assembly and service.

Government and industry climate programs are also quietly accelerating this quality-and-traceability trend. New aircraft concepts are being developed under initiatives that aim for step-change efficiency, and that typically means more composite and sandwich structures. For example, the Clean Aviation partnership states an ambition to decrease aircraft greenhouse gas emissions by no less than 30% compared with 2020 state-of-the-art technology. Separately, ICAO’s 41st Assembly adopted a long-term goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 for international aviation.

Drivers

Lightweighting Pressure From Fuel Costs and Net-Zero Targets Drives Core Materials Use

This demand is not theoretical—it is being pulled by a long, visible production pipeline. Airbus delivered 766 commercial aircraft in 2024 and reported a year-end backlog of 8,658 aircraft, which implies multi-year build activity across thousands of structures where lightweight panels are standard practice. This demand is not theoretical—it is being pulled by a long, visible production pipeline. Airbus delivered 766 commercial aircraft in 2024 and reported a year-end backlog of 8,658 aircraft, which implies multi-year build activity across thousands of structures where lightweight panels are standard practice.

Climate commitments are also turning lightweighting into a board-level priority. IATA member airlines passed a resolution committing to net-zero carbon by 2050, which keeps continuous pressure on the whole value chain—airframes, materials, operations, and fuels—to find real reductions, not just small tweaks. ICAO reinforced the same direction when its 41st Assembly adopted a long-term goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 for international aviation. These commitments matter for core materials because lighter aircraft need less energy to move, and sandwich structures are one of the cleanest “physics wins” engineers can still capture at scale.

Government initiatives are adding another layer of momentum by funding technology pathways that require structural change, not only fuel blending. In the United States, the U.S. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Grand Challenge sets targets of 3 billion gallons per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050 (while aiming for at least a 50% life-cycle emissions reduction versus conventional fuel). Even when SAF is the headline, the practical effect is broader: airlines and OEMs pursue multiple levers at once—SAF plus aerodynamic and structural efficiency—because no single lever is enough on its own.

Europe is pushing both regulation and R&D in parallel. The European Commission notes that ReFuelEU Aviation is designed to deliver a CO₂ emissions reduction of more than 60% by 2050 (compared with 1990 levels), reinforcing long-term efficiency and technology change across aircraft and operations. On the innovation side, Clean Aviation (an EU public-private partnership) is explicitly aimed at disruptive aircraft technologies and sets a technology ambition to deliver net GHG reductions of no less than 30% versus 2020 state-of-the-art, with readiness targeted for entry-into-service by 2035.

Restraints

High Costs and Supply Chain Limits Slow Adoption of Core Materials

One of the biggest restraining factors for aerospace and defense core materials is high cost driven by raw materials, processing complexity, and constrained supply chains. Engineers and procurement teams often love the performance advantages of lightweight cores—such as honeycomb or high-grade structural foams—but real budgets and production bottlenecks frequently force them to pause. Unlike commodity metals and basic alloys, advanced cores require specialized manufacturing, stringent quality checks, and long certification cycles that all add time and money. This means that even when designers want to adopt next-generation materials, finance teams often push back, especially in slower markets or defense programs with tight annual budgets.

To put this into perspective, consider how wider industrial trends underscore the cost sensitivity in aerospace. Energy and input costs have a direct ripple effect on raw material pricing. For example, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reports that the FAO Food Price Index averaged 118.2 points in 2024, showing that even basic industrial inputs tied to energy and logistics remain volatile and relatively high compared with previous years. These rising indices reflect pressures on freight, manufacturing energy, and supply reliability across sectors—not just food—emphasizing that cost pressures are broad and often unpredictable.

In aerospace, these pressures are more acute because every kilogram matters in the aircraft weight-fuel equation: lighter structures save fuel over the life of a plane, but the upfront cost premium for advanced cores is non-trivial. For some programs, core materials can cost 2–5 times more per kilogram than traditional aluminum honeycomb, depending on the type and certification level. That adds millions to an airframe program before the first revenue flight. Even defense budgets, which are often stable, are affected: in the United States 2025 defense budget, about $850 billion was requested for the Department of Defense’s discretionary activities, but a large share goes to weapons systems and personnel costs before materials procurement.

Government initiatives aimed at supporting domestic industries also sometimes unintentionally restrict access to affordable materials. For instance, the U.S. and European Union both promote domestic sourcing and strategic autonomy for critical aerospace components, but this can reduce global competition and keep prices high. Programs such as Buy America/Buy European clauses condition defense awards on local suppliers, reducing the global supply pool for certain core material technologies and keeping costs elevated when local supply cannot meet demand quickly.

Opportunity

Autonomous Drones and High-Rate Aircraft Builds Create a Big Opportunity

Defense is opening a second, very different lane: large numbers of low-cost drones and uncrewed platforms. The U.S. Department of Defense’s Replicator initiative is one example of this shift toward scale. Public reporting indicates the Pentagon secured roughly $500 million for Replicator in FY2024, and the same amount was included in the FY2025 budget request. Even where the exact platform mix changes, the direction is clear: higher volumes of air vehicles create demand for lightweight, repeatable structures.

This opportunity grows even stronger because defense spending is rising globally. SIPRI reports world military expenditure reached $2,718 billion in 2024, up 9.4% in real terms from 2023, and the fastest year-on-year rise since at least 1988. Larger budgets do not automatically guarantee more advanced materials, but they do increase the number of funded programs—UAVs, rotorcraft upgrades, maritime drones, and deployable structures—where lightweight sandwich panels are a practical advantage.

A third opportunity sits in next-generation aircraft technology programs, especially in Europe, where policy is pushing for step-change efficiency. The Clean Aviation partnership states an ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 30% compared with 2020 technology, encouraging disruptive airframe and propulsion solutions. To reach those targets, OEMs and Tier-1s often need structural concepts that cut mass while maintaining stiffness—exactly the engineering “job” core materials do well. That creates space for newer core types that can be qualified for tougher environments and higher production rates.

Regional Insights

APAC leads with a 43.20% share, generating USD 204.8 Million in aerospace & defense core materials due to strong regional industrial growth

In 2024, the Asia Pacific (APAC) region emerged as a key geographical leader in the aerospace & defense core materials market, capturing a commanding 43.20% share with an estimated USD 204.8 million in revenue. This leadership was supported by rapid expansion of commercial and defense aircraft production in countries such as China, India, Japan, and South Korea, where governments and manufacturers have increased investments in aviation infrastructure and modernized defense fleets. APAC’s rising aircraft deliveries and unmanned systems programs drove demand for advanced lightweight materials that improve fuel efficiency, structural performance, and operational durability.

The dominance in 2024 also stemmed from a broader aerospace supply chain evolving to incorporate core materials such as honeycomb and advanced foams in key structural components where weight reduction is critical for performance. In 2025, APAC maintained its leadership position as ongoing production ramp-ups and new aircraft platforms continued to push material consumption higher, supported by growth in aerospace exports and regional collaborations with global OEMs.

The combination of supportive government policies, expanding manufacturing capacity, and competitive cost structures underpinned steady regional adoption of core materials in both commercial and military aerospace applications. APAC’s performance in 2024 and into 2025 highlights its strategic importance to the global aerospace & defense core materials market, with sustained growth expected as regional aircraft production and defense spending continue to strengthen.

self-driving shuttles in Punggol

to new MRT stations to a long-awaited cross-border rail link, 2026 will bring some of Singapore’s biggest transport changes in years.

After a year marked by

rail disruptions

and reliability concerns, the public can expect new travel options, greener fuels in the air and at sea, and infrastructural upgrades aimed at smoother, faster journeys at home and to and from Johor Bahru.

Here is what to expect in the transport realm in 2026, and a round-up of the biggest developments in 2025.

1. More self-driving vehicles on the roads

Residents in Punggol can expect self-driving shuttle services to

start carrying passengers in early 2026

.

From then, the public will be invited to try the autonomous shuttles for free, ahead of the launch of paid services later in the year. For safety, a trained operator will be on board at all times during the initial roll-out to monitor the vehicles and intervene if necessary.

The shuttles – a mix of five- and eight-seater vehicles – will run on three routes serving parts of Punggol that are harder to reach by public transport, potentially cutting travel times by up to 15 minutes.

Two routes, operated by technology company Grab and autonomous driving technology firm WeRide, will connect residents to key amenities including Punggol Coast MRT station, Punggol Coast Bus Interchange, shopping malls and the polyclinic.

A third route

will be run by transport company ComfortDelGro

using driverless vehicles supplied by autonomous driving firm Pony.ai.

Beyond Punggol, six driverless buses will be deployed from mid-2026 on

public routes in Marina Bay, Shenton Way and one-north in Buona Vista

as part of a three-year pilot by the Land Transport Authority (LTA).

Looking ahead, Acting Transport Minister Jeffrey Siow said Singapore aims to have between 100 and 150 self-driving vehicles on its roads by the end of 2026.

2. The MRT network will grow

Passengers will have new travel options in 2026 with the opening of several MRT stations.

The sixth stage of the Circle Line (CCL6) will debut in the first half of the year,

adding three underground stations

– Keppel, Cantonment and Prince Edward Road – to close the loop between HarbourFront and Marina Bay.

Once operational, CCL6 is expected to shorten travel times and give passengers alternative routes that bypass the crowded City Hall and Raffles Place interchanges.

In the second half of 2026, the fifth stage of the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL5), comprising Bedok South and Sungei Bedok stations, will begin service.

At the same time, the 2.2km Downtown Line (DTL) extension in the east will open, linking Expo station to the future Xilin and Sungei Bedok stations.

The

TEL5 and DTL projects faced delays

due to complex construction challenges, including tunnelling near critical infrastructure. But once completed, they will offer faster, more convenient connections for passengers.

In 2026, there may also be an update on the proposed Seletar MRT Line,

which LTA is studying

. Mr Siow said he hopes to provide this update probably during the Budget debate in 2026, which typically takes place between February and March.

If approved, the line could serve areas such as Woodlands, Sembawang, Sengkang West, Serangoon North, Whampoa, Kallang and the Greater Southern Waterfront.

3. Green fuels in the air and at sea

Travellers flying out of Singapore from Oct 1, 2026,

will pay a levy of $1 to $41.60

to support the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel. The levy applies to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing Singapore on or after Oct 1.

Economy and premium economy class passengers will pay $1 to $10.40, while business and first-class travellers will pay $4 to $41.60, depending on the destination. Passengers on longer flights will incur higher levies due to greater fuel consumption. Business and first-class passengers will pay up to four times more than economy passengers, based on industry norms for calculating carbon emissions.

Singapore is also taking a major step towards greener shipping in 2026. From Jan 1, the Maritime and Port Authority will issue five-year licences to supply methanol as marine fuel at the Port of Singapore, furthering its ambition to become a sustainable multi-fuel bunkering hub. This move will strengthen Singapore’s position as a regional leader in clean shipping, helping to scale up the use of sustainable fuels as the maritime industry moves to greener alternatives.

4. RTS Link

The

Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link

will be a long-awaited game-changer for cross-border travel.

When it opens by the end of 2026, the 4km light rail will whisk passengers between Bukit Chagar in Johor Bahru and Woodlands North in about five minutes. It is designed to ease huge crowding at

the Causeway, where more than 300,000 people cross daily

by road.

The service will run daily from 6am to midnight, with trains every 3.6 minutes at peak hours and capacity for up to 10,000 passengers per hour in each direction. Trains have already started arriving for testing, and the project is

on track for its planned launch

.

The RTS will feature co-located Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) facilities, meaning passengers clear both sides’ checks at the start of the journey, for a smoother experience.

In early December, Singapore and Malaysia inked an

additional deal on the RTS Link

that will facilitate preparations for the co-located CIQ facilities and the eventual operationalisation of the rail link.

Officials and businesses said the link will boost connectivity and economic ties between Singapore and Johor, supporting daily commuters, tourism and investment.

5. Renewal of BPLRT

Renewal works for the Bukit Panjang LRT (BPLRT) Line, which began in 2018, are

expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2026

, promising residents a more reliable ride on the ageing 8km network.

The main remaining task is replacing the power rail, which supplies electricity to the trains. LTA said in November that about a fifth of this work has been done, with completion scheduled for late 2026.

This is the first time the power rail system has been replaced since the BPLRT began operations in 1999. Each night, roughly 45m of the power rail – or 0.26 per cent of the 17km network – is replaced.

Other upgrades are complete, including a new communications-based train control signalling system and a fleet refresh: All 19 first-generation trains have been replaced with third-generation ones, and all 13 second-generation trains upgraded to be compatible with the new system. The BPLRT has a history of reliability issues, with

two major disruptions reported in July 2025

.

Looking back

1. Rail reliability

Rail reliability was thrust into the spotlight in the second half of 2025 after a string of service disruptions across Singapore’s MRT and LRT networks.

In response to at least 15 delays and interruptions between July and September, the LTA and public transport operators SMRT and SBS Transit

set up a task force

to find immediate solutions to improve service reliability and responses to disruptions.

The task force is supported by a five-member international advisory panel of rail experts, reviewing maintenance practices, incident response and system operations. It is expected to submit final recommendations by the end of 2025.

One recommendation is that MRT passengers can

expect more scheduled closures that last longer

, giving maintenance workers extra time for major upgrades.

“Longer closures allow repair work to be done more safely and efficiently,” said Mr Siow. Shortening operating hours for such work by closing stations early or opening them late is no longer considered sufficient.

To keep passengers better informed of the status of the train network, LTA launched a new webpage on Dec 13 with

real-time updates for all rail lines

, including ongoing delays. SMRT and SBS Transit will also prioritise on-site communications for minor delays at the affected stations.

The webpage was launched after some passengers expressed frustration at the absence of updates on SMRT’s social media channels during two separate train disruptions on Nov 18 and Dec 2.

Separately,

SMRT was in July

fined $2.4 million

over a major six-day disruption that affected a stretch of the East-West Line in September 2024. The penalty was reduced from the $3 million LTA had intended to impose.

2. Work starts on T5; passenger traffic expected to top pre-pandemic figures

In May, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong

broke ground on Changi Airport Terminal 5 (T5)

, a project more than a decade in the making that will prepare the airport for an expected surge in air travel across the Asia-Pacific and beyond.

Designed to handle about 50 million passengers a year, T5 will effectively double Changi Airport’s footprint and increase its total capacity from 90 million to 140 million passengers yearly, a rise of more than 55 per cent.

National carrier Singapore Airlines and its budget subsidiary Scoot will consolidate their operations under one roof at T5 when the terminal opens in the mid-2030s.

Meanwhile, Changi Airport’s total passenger traffic in 2025 is expected to exceed pre-pandemic figures, after

67.7 million travellers passed through in 2024

, slightly short of the 68.3 million in 2019.

3. Jetstar Asia shuts

On June 11, travellers awoke to the news that Singapore-based low-cost carrier

Jetstar Asia would be shutting down

. Its final flight landed on July 31, more than 20 years after its maiden flight in December 2004.

Jetstar Asia operated about 180 weekly flights from Changi Airport and carried 2.3 million passengers in 2024, around 3 per cent of the airport’s traffic. More than 500 employees, including over 100 pilots and nearly 300 cabin crew, were retrenched.

Australian flag carrier Qantas, its parent company, said rising costs and stiff regional competition had eroded Jetstar Asia’s ability to offer low fares. The airline had been profitable for only six of its 20 years.

The announcement left passengers with future bookings disappointed and frustrated, with some lamenting the loss of a budget travel option. Yet many

rallied around the cabin crew

, leaving gifts and handwritten notes to thank them for their service.

Hundreds of people, including former employees, thronged the arrival hall at Changi Airport Terminal 4 on

Jetstar Asia’s final day of operations

in an emotional farewell.

4. COE premium for smaller cars hits record highs

The certificate of entitlement (COE) premium for smaller cars

hit record highs

over three consecutive bidding exercises in September and October, even though more certificates were available.

Category A COEs, which are for the registration of smaller, less powerful cars and electric vehicles (EVs), peaked at a record $128,105 on Oct 8. Prices

dipped after the Oct 23 tender

.

LTA said the persistently high prices were due to sustained strong demand, despite the supply of Category A COEs rising by 29 per cent compared with a year earlier.

The lower costs of EVs, especially

those from China

, as well as the impending reduction of incentives for cleaner-energy vehicles, also added to demand.

Industry watchers said demand was boosted by buyers rushing to lock in purchases after LTA announced in September that incentives for EVs and hybrid vehicles

would be cut by up to $10,000 from January 2026

.

In other words, even though more COEs were available for bidding, demand rose even faster, driven in part by consumers trying to beat the impending reduction in vehicle incentives.

5. Pedestrian-only paths

From July 1, cyclists and riders of non-motorised personal mobility devices (PMDs), such as kick scooters, can be

fined for using pedestrian-only footpaths

across Singapore.

More than 200km of footpaths next to cycling lanes have been converted into pedestrian-only paths since the initiative was

announced in August 2024

.

These paths are reserved for pedestrians and users of personal mobility aids (PMAs), such as electric wheelchairs, and are marked with the words “pedestrians only” painted on the ground.

Cycling paths, in contrast, are painted red.

First-time offenders caught riding on a pedestrian-only path can be fined up to $2,000, jailed for up to three months, or both.

Pedestrians who stray into cycling paths will not face penalties, though the LTA advises them to keep to pedestrian-only paths for their safety.

After cyclists raised concerns about being unfairly targeted, Minister of State for Transport Baey Yam Keng said enforcement

The deal strengthens fleet standardization and long-term operational efficiency.

The program expands the Spanish Air and Space Force’s reliance on the C295 while reinforcing domestic aerospace production and logistics integration across multiple training bases.

Spain Orders 18 C295 Aircraft

The acquisition is designed to harmonize Spain’s military transport fleet around the C295 platform. Spain already operates the aircraft in transport, maritime patrol, and surveillance roles, and this order raises the total fleet to 46 units.

According to Airbus Defence and Space, the contract supports Spain’s strategic autonomy while reinforcing the national aerospace industrial base. All aircraft will be assembled at Airbus facilities in Seville, ensuring continuity for domestic production and skilled employment.

The C295 in transport configuration can carry up to 70 troops or 50 paratroopers. It supports operations from unprepared runways and is capable of cargo drops, paratrooper deployment, and medical evacuation missions.

Two-Phase Delivery Aligned With Operational Roles

The agreement is structured in two delivery batches to match operational needs.

The first batch will support pilot and paratrooper training at the Military Air Transport School located at Matacán Air Base in Salamanca. These aircraft will replace the CN235 fleet currently used for passenger, cargo, and training missions. Deliveries will begin in 2026 and conclude in 2028.

The second batch will be assigned to advanced paratrooper and cargo drop missions at the Military Parachuting School at Alcantarilla Air Base in Murcia. These aircraft will replace the C212 fleet, with deliveries scheduled between 2030 and 2032.

Integrated Training Systems and Long-Term Support

The contract includes a comprehensive ground-based training system tailored to the Spanish Air and Space Force requirements. This package includes flight simulators, computer-aided instruction tools, and training management software deployed in Salamanca and Murcia.

Airbus will also provide full fleet support services at the Military Transport School. This includes aircraft maintenance, material management, and training center operations through December 2032.

The C295 is the leading aircraft in its segment, with 329 orders from 38 countries worldwide. The global fleet has accumulated more than 710,000 flight hours across military and special mission roles.

Its selection reinforces Spain’s long-term commitment to a proven platform with established logistics, training, and lifecycle support.

About C295 Aircraft

Last year, the Airbus C295 medium tactical transport aircraft crossed a major milestone with 300 orders worldwide, reinforcing its position as the global market leader in its class.

Operated across diverse climates and missions, the C295 has become a cornerstone platform for military transport, surveillance, humanitarian relief, and special operations.

A Global Programme Built for Scale and Longevity

The 300th order milestone was achieved following Kazakhstan’s acquisition of its third C295 transport aircraft for the National Security Committee Aviation Service. This addition expands an existing fleet and reflects continued confidence from repeat customers.

Since its first delivery in 2000 to the Spanish Air and Space Force, the C295 has grown into the most widely used medium tactical transport aircraft. It now commands over 80 percent of its market segment, with 41 operators across 37 countries in Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Nineteen of these operators have placed repeat orders, underlining sustained operational value.

India stands as the largest customer, with 56 aircraft on order. Sixteen aircraft are being assembled in Seville, while 40 will be produced locally by Tata in Vadodara under the Make in India programme. Deliveries to the Indian Air Force began in September 2023, with a steady delivery schedule extending through 2026.

Collectively, the global C295 fleet has accumulated more than 610,000 flight hours. The Spanish Air and Space Force leads in total fleet hours, while Brazil operates the single aircraft with the highest recorded flight time.

Design Origins and European Industrial Footprint

The C295 traces its roots to Spain’s aerospace industry through CASA, following the success of the C212 and CN235 programmes. Officially launched in 1996, the aircraft first flew in November 1997 from Getafe and received military certification in 1999.

Designed as an evolution of the CN235, the C295 offers roughly 50 percent greater capability. Key upgrades include Pratt and Whitney Canada PW100 engines rated at 2,645 horsepower, a redesigned wing, and enhanced systems, while retaining strong platform commonality.

The aircraft’s name reflects its heritage and intent. C stands for CASA, 2 denotes twin engines, and 95 refers to the original 9.5 tonne payload target.

Spain remains central to the programme. Design and engineering are based in Getafe, with pre-assembly in Seville and final assembly at Airbus San Pablo Sur. In December 2023, Spain further reinforced national industrial capability by ordering 16 C295s in advanced maritime patrol and surveillance configurations, all designed and built domestically.

Manufacturing, Training, and Global Support Network

Final assembly of the C295 typically takes between one and two years for transport variants, with longer timelines for complex mission configurations. Between 200 and 250 specialists are directly involved in each aircraft’s production, which follows four core phases: integration, testing, painting, and flight.

Digital manufacturing plays a central role, with technicians using tablets and mixed reality tools instead of paper documentation. Airbus is also expanding production capacity through a second final assembly line in Vadodara, India.

In-service support is anchored by the San Pablo Norte facility in Seville, which provides maintenance, repair, and overhaul services. Training is delivered through the International Training Centre at San Pablo, where pilots, technicians, and loadmasters undergo courses ranging from two to sixty days. To date, around 700 pilots and 1,700 maintenance technicians have been qualified.

Airbus also deploys field service representatives at operator bases worldwide to maintain high fleet availability.

Mission Versatility Across Air, Sea, and Land

The C295’s defining strength is versatility. In transport configuration, it can carry up to 70 troops, 48 paratroopers, vehicles, pallets, or mixed cargo. It can also be rapidly reconfigured for medical evacuation, accommodating up to 24 stretchers and intensive care equipment.

Mission variants include maritime patrol, maritime surveillance, search and rescue, signals intelligence, and special operations. These aircraft are equipped with Airbus’ FITS mission system, enabling advanced sensor fusion and remote operation from land bases.

The C295 is also capable of aerial refuelling operations using a roll-on, roll-off kit, and can support both fixed-wing and rotary-wing receivers.

Operational performance has been demonstrated in demanding environments. Fleet availability rates above 95 percent have been recorded during sustained deployments in Africa and the Middle East. The aircraft’s short takeoff and landing capability allows operations from unpaved and austere runways, including roads in contingency scenarios.

Proven Record in Humanitarian and Security Missions

Beyond military roles, the C295 has played a critical part in humanitarian relief, disaster response, and medical evacuation. It has supported wildfire suppression in South America, emergency medical transport across island chains, and rapid evacuation missions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Notable missions include night landings on unprepared jungle runways for medical evacuation in Colombia and high-tempo UN peacekeeping support in Mali, where aircraft flew extended daily sorties carrying personnel and cargo.

The platform also aligns with sustainability goals. The C295 can operate on up to 50 percent sustainable aviation fuel without modification, supporting military decarbonisation efforts.

Support the research and development of Maryland-based renewable fuel production facilities using 2nd-generation feedstocks, e.g., sustainable aviation fuels, renewable natural gas, cellulosic, cover crops, and waste feedstocks.","The Maryland Biofuels Task Force, a diverse coalition of approximately 50 subject-matter experts representing 30-plus agricultural, environmental, governmental, nonprofit, academic, and industry organizations, on Dec. 15 released its comprehensive report assessing the challenges, costs, feasibility, and statewide benefits of expanding the use of higher biofuel blends across Maryland.

The Maryland Department of the Environment estimates that achieving state carbon reduction targets could generate $135 billion in societal benefits. The report concludes that adopting a Maryland Clean Fuel Standard (CFS) would accelerate progress toward these goals while reducing energy costs for consumers and improving statewide economic and environmental resilience.

Key Findings

• Reduce 3.0 million metric tons of CO₂ annually—equal to removing nearly 1 million gasoline vehicles.

• Lower gasoline prices by $0.20–$0.40 per gallon, saving Maryland drivers $569M–$1B annually.

• Reduce diesel prices by 1–4%, lowering trucking, farm, and consumer costs by more than $100M.

• Improve air quality by reducing BTEX aromatics, PM2.5, and mobile-source air toxics—lowering health care costs and preventing an estimated 30 premature deaths annually.

• Preserve farmland and support agricultural income while slowing Maryland’s rapid rate of farmland loss.

• Strengthen Maryland’s resilience to fuel disruptions and foreign oil volatility through expanded domestic renewable fuel supplies.

Antoine M. Thompson, executive director, Greater Washington Region Clean Cities Coalition (GWRCCC), stated, “Maryland now has a clear roadmap showing that cleaner, cheaper, and healthier transportation options are available today—and biofuels are one of the fastest ways to get there. Higher blends like E15 and B20 can be deployed immediately, using existing vehicles and infrastructure, to lower emissions, strengthen the state’s economy, and improve the state's very vulnerable energy security. This report proves Maryland can meet its climate goals while lowering costs for families, farmers, small businesses, and truckers.”

Jill Hamilton, Chair, GWRCCC board of directors, and president of Sustainable Energy Strategies, Inc., stated, “The Task Force brought together an unprecedented coalition of agriculture, energy, environmental, and public-health leaders. What we found is unmistakable: biofuels are a powerful complement to electric vehicles (EVs) and other clean technologies, offering Marylanders affordable choices that reduce pollution right now. These findings give Maryland the opportunity to lead the nation in clean transportation.”

The Task Force report outlines how Maryland can benefit from the Maryland Commission on Climate Change’s recent recommendation for the state to adopt a clean fuel standard. A new Clean Fuel Standard will help meet the state’s Climate Solutions Now Act (CSNA) requirement of a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2031 and fill a gap created by a rollback in federal environmental regulations for clean vehicles and trucks, as well as federal funding for EVs and EV infrastructure.

“By transitioning from the current 10% ethanol national renewable fuel standard (E10) to 15% blends (E15) and adding 20% biodiesel to diesel fuel (B20), Maryland would benefit from an immediate, scalable, and cost-effective tool that can save money, taxes, farms, and lives – one more gallon of biofuels at a time,” said Task Force Coordinator Burl Haigwood.

Summary of Recommendations

1. Support research to quantify the benefits of the Maryland Commission on Climate Change’s recommendation for Maryland to adopt a Clean Fuel Standard.

2. Create a roadmap to implement a statewide transition to E15 and B20, including adoption by state and local fleets.

3. Expand consumer education and improve fuel content transparency.

4. Incentivize the development of more refueling infrastructure to sell higher blends of biofuels.

5. Preserve farmland and support agricultural markets through stable biofuel demand.

6. Integrate the awareness of the benefits of biofuels into driver education, fleet training, and public health outreach campaigns.

7. Support the research and development of Maryland-based renewable fuel production facilities using 2nd-generation feedstocks, e.g., sustainable aviation fuels, renewable natural gas, cellulosic, cover crops, and waste feedstocks.

Additional TaskForce Member Quotes and Contact Information

Lindsay Thompson, Executive Director, Maryland Grain Producers & Utilization Board: “Maryland is losing thousands of acres of farmland every year, and the economic pressures on grain farmers are real. Biofuels stabilize crop prices, preserve working farmland, and reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions. Without strong local demand for corn and soybeans, we risk losing farms permanently to development—and once farmland is gone, it never comes back.”

Danielle Bauer, executive director, Maryland Soybean Board: “Biofuels are a lifeline for Maryland’s farm economy. Biofuels produced from corn and soybeans create reliable markets for growers, add value to every bushel, and support thousands of farm-sector jobs. Simply increasing the percentage of biofuels in gasoline and diesel fuel will strengthen the agricultural backbone of this state while delivering cleaner air and more affordable transportation fuels for all Marylanders.”

Ed Hubbard, general counsel, Renewable Fuels Association: “Maryland drivers could save hundreds of millions of dollars each year simply by choosing a cleaner, higher-octane fuel that works in 97% of the vehicles on the road today. Expanding access to higher ethanol blends, such as E15, has proven to increase fuel supplies, lower gasoline prices, and reduce imported crude oil, which the U.S. still imports from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+). Many of the OPEC+ members are considered our hostile geopolitical adversaries.

Stephen Dodge, vice president of state government affairs, Clean Fuels Alliance America: “Biodiesel and renewable diesel lower the cost of diesel fuel, improve fuel availability, and provide immediate emissions reductions for the trucks, buses, and heavy-duty industrial equipment Maryland relies on every day. A statewide move to B20 is a win for consumers, for truckers, and for cleaner air across Maryland.

Jonathan Phillips, executive director, Groundwork Elizabeth: “Communities across Maryland—especially in Baltimore—live with some of the highest burdens of asthma, cardiovascular disease, and exposure to mobile-source air toxics. Increasing biofuel blends reduces BTEX aromatics, particulate matter, and carbon emissions. The health benefits are substantial, lifesaving, and immediate. This is environmental justice in action with real health care savings. As we witnessed with the tobacco industry, federal and state governments and every consumer eventually pay for the increased cost of health care from the negative health effects of air pollution, about half from transportation fuels.”

Joanne Ivancic, executive director, Advanced Biofuels USA: “Advanced Biofuels USA commends the Maryland Biofuels Task Force Work Group for preparing materials for the public, and leaders in policy and business, so they can better understand the crucial need for and benefits of biofuels in Maryland,” noted executive director Joanne Ivancic. “Encouraging and facilitating a transition to renewable fuels for existing on-road transportation as soon as possible with the low-carbon fuels currently available has immediate benefit for climate change mitigation and should not be delayed a moment longer,” she continued.

Maritime shipping plays a key role in global trade, providing transportation for roughly 80% of goods bought and sold internationally. At the same time, maritime vessels generate significant emissions—contributing around 3% of total worldwide emissions, which is comparable to the annual emissions certain developed countries including Japan.

The need for reliable, affordable, low-carbon energy has never been greater—or more attainable. The shipping industry has the potential to reduce emissions through advancements in renewable fuels that balance environmental and economic needs.

Now, new technology and supply chain integration are making it possible to produce renewable marine fuels at scale, especially as new processes unlock the potential of biomass sources and streamline upgrading steps.

The potential of biocrude

Meeting energy demand within the maritime industry requires an additive approach that leverages a variety of fuel sources to help the maritime industry shift to lower-emission alternatives.

One promising solution is the use of biocrude, hydrocarbon-rich oil produced through the thermochemical processing of inexpensive and abundant biomass. Common sources for biocrude include agricultural residues and organic waste, making it a more sustainable option for fuel production compared to more established methods.

Although biocrude has been around for some time, recent technological improvements in how it’s made—such as better reaction speeds, feedstock preparation and streamlined processes—have made it much more practical for large-scale use. This approach allows for steady progress with transitional fuels and paves the way for wider use of advanced renewable fuels as they become commercially available.

Honeywell’s Biocrude Upgrading technology offers a glimpse at how innovation can accelerate this shift. The process converts solid biomass into biocrude that is then upgraded into “drop-in” fuels that provide a cost-effective and lower-carbon alternative to traditional heavy fuel oil.

With higher energy density than many current biofuel alternatives, this renewable marine fuel can extend a vessel’s range without requiring costly engine upgrades.

Honeywell’s technology efficiently turns forestry trimmings, wood shavings, and timber debris—materials usually hard to use for fuel—into biocrude. This process handles their high oxygen and moisture content, making it easier for producers to use a wider range of feedstocks. Using abundant biomass as feedstock, along with straightforward technology, makes implementation easy for existing refiners—all while using existing infrastructure and equipment.

Biocrude can then be transported and refined at large facilities into marine fuel, gasoline, or sustainable aviation fuel, helping overcome the obstacles converting biocrudes into fuels with performance comparable to conventional fuel.

The path forward

Reducing carbon emissions is a top priority for many large-scale organizations across all industries. Achieving lower shipping emissions will not be accomplished by a single solution; instead, it requires a comprehensive strategy that incorporates renewable fuels, cleaner combustion systems, digital optimization and more.

The maritime sector continues to seek out renewable energy, but its pace depends on bridging the cost gap between traditional and renewable fuels. Wider use of innovative process technologies such as upgraded biocrude—alongside lower-carbon fuels like LNG, methanol, ammonia and e-fuels—requires effective collaboration among innovators, refiners, shippers, policymakers and other stakeholders.

The positive tipping point for energy transition exists – renewable energy is now cheaper than fossil fuels, and deployment rates are accelerating.","David Sathuluri is a Research Associate and Dr. Marco Tedesco is a Lamont Research Professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.

As climate scientists warn that we are approaching irreversible tipping points in the Earth’s climate system, paradoxically the very technologies being deployed to detect these tipping points – often based on AI – are exacerbating the problem, via acceleration of the associated energy consumption.

The UK’s much-celebrated £81-million ($109-million) Forecasting Tipping Points programme involving 27 teams, led by the Advanced Research + Invention Agency (ARIA), represents a contemporary faith in technological salvation – yet it embodies a profound contradiction. The ARIA programme explicitly aims to “harness the laws of physics and artificial intelligence to pick up subtle early warning signs of tipping” through advanced modelling.

We are deploying massive computational infrastructure to warn us of climate collapse while these same systems consume the energy and water resources needed to prevent or mitigate it. We are simultaneously investing in computationally intensive AI systems to monitor whether we will cross irreversible climate tipping points, even as these same AI systems could fuel that transition.

The computational cost of monitoring

Training a single large language model like GPT-3 consumed approximately 1,287 megawatt-hours of electricity, resulting in 552 metric tons of carbon dioxide – equivalent to driving 123 gasoline-powered cars for a year, according to a recent study.

GPT-4 required roughly 50 times more electricity. As the computational power needed for AI continues to double approximately every 100 days, the energy footprint of these systems is not static but is exponentially accelerating.

UN adopts first-ever resolution on AI and environment, but omits lifecycle

And the environmental consequences of AI models extend far beyond electricity usage. Besides massive amounts of electricity (much of which is still fossil-fuel-based), such systems require advanced cooling that consumes enormous quantities of water, and sophisticated infrastructure that must be manufactured, transported, and deployed globally.

The water-energy nexus in climate-vulnerable regions

A single data center can consume up to 5 million gallons of drinking water per day – sufficient to supply thousands of households or farms. In the Phoenix area of the US alone, more than 58 data centers consume an estimated 170 million gallons of drinking water daily for cooling.

The geographical distribution of this infrastructure matters profoundly as data centers requiring high rates of mechanical cooling are disproportionately located in water-stressed and socioeconomically vulnerable regions, particularly in Asia-Pacific and Africa.

At the same time, we are deploying AI-intensive early warning systems to monitor climate tipping points in regions like Greenland, the Arctic, and the Atlantic circulation system – regions already experiencing catastrophic climate impacts. They represent thresholds that, once crossed, could trigger irreversible changes within decades, scientists have warned.

Nine of our best climate stories from 2025

Yet computational models and AI-driven early warning systems operate according to different temporal logics. They promise to provide warnings that enable future action, but they consume energy – and therefore contribute to emissions – in the present.

This is not merely a technical problem to be solved with renewable energy deployment; it reflects a fundamental misalignment between the urgency of climate tipping points and the gradualist assumptions embedded in technological solutions.

The carbon budget concept reveals that there is a cumulative effect on how emissions impact on temperature rise, with significant lags between atmospheric concentration and temperature impact. Every megawatt-hour consumed by AI systems training on climate models today directly reduces the available carbon budget for tomorrow – including the carbon budget available for the energy transition itself.

The governance void

The deeper issue is that governance frameworks for AI development have completely decoupled from carbon budgets and tipping point timescales. UK AI regulation focuses on how much computing power AI systems use, but it does not require developers to ask: is this AI’s carbon footprint small enough to fit within our carbon budget for preventing climate tipping points?

There is no mechanism requiring that AI infrastructure deployment decisions account for the specific carbon budgets associated with preventing different categories of tipping points.

Meanwhile, the energy transition itself – renewable capacity expansion, grid modernization, electrification of transport – requires computation and data management. If we allow unconstrained AI expansion, we risk the perverse outcome in which computing infrastructure consumes the surplus renewable energy that could otherwise accelerate decarbonization, rather than enabling it.

What would it mean to resolve the paradox?

Resolving this paradox requires, for example, moving beyond the assumption that technological solutions can be determined in isolation from carbon constraints. It demands several interventions:

First, any AI-driven climate monitoring system must operate within an explicitly defined carbon budget that directly reflects the tipping-point timescale it aims to detect. If we are attempting to provide warnings about tipping points that could be triggered within 10-20 years, the AI system’s carbon footprint must be evaluated against a corresponding carbon budget for that period.

Second, governance frameworks for AI development must explicitly incorporate climate-tipping point science, establishing threshold restrictions on computational intensity in relation to carbon budgets and renewable energy availability. This is not primarily a “sustainability” question; it is a justice and efficacy question.

Third, alternative models must be prioritized over the current trajectory toward ever-larger models. These should include approaches that integrate human expertise with AI in time-sensitive scenarios, carbon-aware model training, and using specialized processors matched to specific computational tasks rather than relying on universal energy-intensive systems.

The deeper critique

The fundamental issue is that the energy-system tipping point paradox reflects a broader crisis in how wealthy nations approach climate governance. We have faith that innovation and science can solve fundamental contradictions, rather than confronting the structural need to constrain certain forms of energy consumption and wealth accumulation. We would rather invest £81 million in computational systems to detect tipping points than make the political decisions required to prevent them.

The positive tipping point for energy transition exists – renewable energy is now cheaper than fossil fuels, and deployment rates are accelerating. What we lack is not technological capacity but political will to rapidly decarbonize, as well as community participation.

IEA: Slow transition away from fossil fuels would cost over a million energy sector jobs

Deploying energy-intensive AI systems to monitor tipping points while simultaneously failing to deploy available renewable energy represents a kind of technological distraction from the actual political choices required.

The paradox is thus also a warning: in the time remaining before irreversible tipping points are triggered, we must choose between building ever-more sophisticated systems to monitor climate collapse or deploying available resources – capital, energy, expertise, political attention – toward allaying the threat.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/12/EUROPE-WEATHER-Data-Centre-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-24 03:12:24.559395

GENERAL COMMENTS:

The reaction of the cattle market to the bullish Cattle on Feed report was less than expected by many. Much of it has already been factored in with the overall numbers in the report, providing continued support under the market. However, the support was not sufficient to close the chart gaps above the market in most contracts. The June, August and December live cattle contracts managed to close the gaps. The other chart gaps may be closed before the end of this week. Boxed beef prices showed strength, with choice up $1.24 and select up $4.67. It is possible that boxed beef has found support and will trend higher. Packers are not expected to be aggressive this week due to Christmas and not needing many cattle due to reduced slaughter and having already purchased some ahead.

Hog futures found support despite lower cash and cutouts. Some of the strength stemmed from traders feeling confident of a stronger pork demand. Some of it could have stemmed from the positioning of traders ahead of the Quarterly Hogs & Pigs report to be released today. The report is likely to have little impact on the market, but there is always concern over the unexpected. Trading activity today will again largely be positioned ahead of the report and the holidays. All hogs and pigs are estimated to be 99.1% of a year ago. Hogs kept for breeding are estimated at 98.8%. The National Daily Direct Afternoon Hog report showed cash down $0.29. Pork cutouts were down $1.35. Packers are expected to be more aggressive today to surround themselves with more hogs ahead of the holidays.

The missing piece: local production Despite Australia’s large canola harvests, the country currently has limited ability to turn crops into fuel.
What it could mean for canola growers If Australia were to establish a sustainable aviation fuel industry, the scale of demand would be significant.
“If a sector for sustainable aviation fuel production is created in Australia, our numbers show that roughly a million tonnes of canola would be needed,” Voznesenski said.
You can explore the economics and implications of canola in more detail in the report Refuelling Australian Aviation.","Australia is set to grow enough canola this year to “fill just over six MCGs”, according to CommBank Agriculture and Sustainability Economist Dennis Voznesenski. Yet very little of that crop stays at home.

“Most of our canola is sent to Asia, the Middle East and Europe,” Voznesenski said.

Once offshore, the oilseed has two main uses. One is familiar – cooking oil. The other surprises many people.

“It’s either eaten as cooking oil or, believe it or not, turned into fuel,” he said.

Why canola is part of the fuel conversation

The idea of crops powering vehicles isn’t new, but it has gained momentum as governments and industries look for ways to cut emissions.

“A while ago scientists found that biofuels, when burnt in a car, truck or plane, produce fewer emissions than conventional fossil fuel,” Voznesenski said.

Biofuels are particularly relevant for sectors where cutting emissions is difficult. Aviation is one of them.

“You can make cars electric but not planes, at least not yet,” he said. “In the case of plane transportation, it helps reduce emissions in a hard to abate sector.”

That makes sustainable aviation fuel a growing focus globally – and a potential opportunity for Australian agriculture.

The missing piece: local production

Despite Australia’s large canola harvests, the country currently has limited ability to turn crops into fuel.

“As of today, there’s very limited capacity to create biofuel in Australia for road-based vehicles, and none for planes,” Voznesenski said.

The main barrier is cost.

“The cost of biofuel far outstrips conventional diesel,” he said.

That price gap has slowed investment locally, even as overseas markets scale up production and demand.

More than an emissions story

While emissions reduction is often the headline, Voznesenski said local biofuel production could deliver broader economic and strategic benefits.

One is supply security.

“Last year Australia imported over 95 per cent of its fuel,” he said. “That’s a scary stat for any industry.”

Producing more fuel domestically could reduce Australia’s exposure to global supply disruptions and geopolitical shocks.

Another benefit is for farmers.

“Creating local demand for crops reduces the risk of economic coercion being used against the farming sector,” Voznesenski said, pointing to recent tariff disputes that have affected agricultural exports over the past five years.

A domestic biofuels industry could provide growers with another major buyer for their crops, helping to diversify income streams and reduce reliance on a small number of export markets.

What it could mean for canola growers

If Australia were to establish a sustainable aviation fuel industry, the scale of demand would be significant.

“If a sector for sustainable aviation fuel production is created in Australia, our numbers show that roughly a million tonnes of canola would be needed,” Voznesenski said.

That level of demand would represent a substantial share of current production and could reshape how and where canola is sold.

It would also keep more value onshore, linking regional farming communities more closely to domestic energy and transport supply chains.

The key takeaway

Canola may look like just another crop, but it sits at the intersection of agriculture, energy security and emissions reduction.

The following morning, she joined Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei tribal members at Ōkahu Bay — their ancestral homeland — to welcome PVS sister canoes Hōkūleʻa and Hikianalia to port.
The nonprofit was founded in 1973 and spent years focusing on reconstructing traditional Hawaiian double-hulled voyaging canoes and recovering ancient wayfaring knowledge.
“Deeply embracing culture and supporting organizations like the Polynesian Voyaging Society has always been a priority,” she said.
“When people see Hawaiian Airlines, they see Hawaiʻi and think of a people, a place and a culture.","On Nov. 17, our Airbus A330, named Hikianalia after the star Spica, touched down in Auckland as the first of two vessels to carry the name. Debbie Nakanelua‑Richards, Hawaiian Airlines’ director of community and cultural relations, was among those on board the flight that evening. The following morning, she joined Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei tribal members at Ōkahu Bay — their ancestral homeland — to welcome PVS sister canoes Hōkūleʻa and Hikianalia to port.

As Hōkūleʻa and Hikianalia emerged on the horizon of Auckland’s Ōkahu Bay, they were soon escorted by the waka hourua (Māori double‑hulled canoe) of the Te Toki Voyaging Trust — a nonprofit dedicated to preserving traditional wayfinding knowledge for Māori. The cultural welcome was a powerful gesture of collective respect for the canoes and their crews, who had sailed from Honolulu to Tahiti, Rarotonga and finally Aotearoa using the same ancient wayfinding techniques as their ancestors, without navigational instruments or modern technology.

The Aotearoa arrival marked another successful leg of PVSʻs Moananuiākea Voyage, a 43,000-nautical-mile, 47-month circumnavigation of the Pacific that touches 36 countries and archipelagoes, nearly 100 indigenous territories and 345 ports.

As a teenager in the 1970s, Debbie’s awareness of the PVS was still growing. The nonprofit was founded in 1973 and spent years focusing on reconstructing traditional Hawaiian double-hulled voyaging canoes and recovering ancient wayfaring knowledge. Hōkūle‘a, the first and foundational canoe of PVS, made history in 1976 when it completed its first voyage to Tahiti. The canoe was welcomed by more than 17,000 Tahitians, over half of Pape‘ete’s population at the time, underscoring a shared commitment to safeguarding indigenous values and practices across Hawaiʻi and the Pacific.

“It was a time when Hawaiian culture was at risk of extinction, so there was deep concern to preserve and pass on important cultural knowledge – our language, dance, music, art, carving and the legacy of exploration and navigation. Hōkūleʻa ignited a cultural renaissance in Hawaiʻi, which continues today,” Debbie said.

Today, Hōkūleʻa continues to carry crews around the world as they convey messages about respecting oceans, protecting cultural knowledge and caring for native communities and the environment.

Hawaiian Airlines has proudly served Hawaiʻi for 96 years and supported PVS for nearly five decades. As the official airline sponsor of the Moananuiākea Voyage, we have contributed 34 million miles (now points) to transport voyagers during crew swaps and deliver critical cargo for food and supply restocks.

Our expansive network has also long connected the same Pacific communities, and since March 2013, our Auckland service has served as a bridge between Hawaiʻi and Aotearoa.

Jay Tansley, the first Māori to become a U.S. Navy SEAL, described the voyage as profound. Born in Aotearoa, his family moved to Hawaiʻi when he was five. He joined PVS to add his skills to the Moananuiākea Voyage.

“Nainoa Thompson [master navigator and CEO of PVS] first told me, ‘the canoe will take you home,’ and ever since, the experience has been incredible,” he said.

“We approached in darkness, but between lightning strikes, we recognized Aotearoa’s long white cloud stretched over Mount Manganui. It was then that we estimated we were only about 200 miles off the coast.”

Kalā Baybayan-Tanaka grew up around voyaging canoes, learning from her father, the late master navigator and Captain Kālepa Baybayan, who crewed Hōkūleʻa in 1975 and on all major voyages. She joined PVS nearly two decades ago and has voyaged on both Hikianalia and Hōkūleʻa as captain, watch captain, navigator, safety officer and education specialist.

“It’s my hope that Hōkūleʻa continues to sail the sea roads that connect our past and future and that our decks stay full with ʻohana of the waʻa [family of the canoe] as we teach and pass on knowledge to future generations,” she said.

While welcoming the canoes, Debbie reiterated Hawaiian Airlines’ longstanding commitment to PVS and Hawaiʻiʻs rich culture.

“Deeply embracing culture and supporting organizations like the Polynesian Voyaging Society has always been a priority,” she said.

“When people see Hawaiian Airlines, they see Hawaiʻi and think of a people, a place and a culture. There is kuleana, or responsibility, that comes with that, and so it matters how we show up to celebrate Hawaiʻi and share our culture – not just at home, but also with the communities we serve.”

POLITICO first reported last week that the Trump administration had solicited industry interest in returning to the oil fields decades after they were nationalized.","Efforts in Washington to strike a bipartisan deal on energy permitting legislation are heading into the holidays on shaky ground after the White House abruptly ordered five offshore wind projects along the East Coast to stop construction.

Now, a key Republican negotiator is throwing more fuel on the fire.

Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chair Mike Lee (R-Utah) wants Republican leaders to scrap the Senate filibuster so legislation — including a potential permitting bill — can be passed along party lines, I report today.

“If Senate Democrats cut off permitting-reform talks, this will make ending the zombie filibuster of immediate, paramount importance,” Lee posted on X on Monday evening.

Lee’s remarks add a new wrinkle to Congress’ push to streamline environmental reviews for infrastructure and energy projects. President Donald Trump blew up the talks Monday when the Interior Department indefinitely paused the wind projects, citing unspecified national security issues — even as energy affordability could put congressional Republicans on the defensive heading into 2026 midterm campaigns.

Trump has been unequivocal in his antipathy toward offshore wind power. Projects have been in the works for years, in part to help Northeastern states meet climate goals and to deliver more power into the regional grid amid rising electricity demand.

“Wind is the worst,” Trump said earlier this month at a rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. “That’s a scam. They ruin your valleys. They ruin your peaks. And [it’s] the most expensive energy.”

Pushing for partisanship

The announcement Monday hit a sore spot for Senate Democrats, who have been advocating for language in any permitting deal that would protect already-approved projects, or what they call “project certainty.”

Senate Environment and Public Works ranking member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Energy and Natural Resources ranking member Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) issued a joint statement saying “there is no path to permitting reform” if the administration can continue to unilaterally cancel or freeze permitted energy projects.

The Democrats suggested they could return to negotiations if the administration reverses its “illegal attacks” on renewables.

But Congress’ plan could be scrambled for some time because of Lee’s demands for a more partisan approach.

Lee has argued for the elimination of what he calls the “zombie filibuster,” the procedural tool in the Senate that effectively requires legislation to get at least 60 votes to advance. In practice, it means almost all major legislation has to be bipartisan to pass.

The idea could get White House support. Trump himself has called for senators to end the filibuster, despite misgivings from many of the chamber’s Republicans. It could also backfire and make it harder to secure support in Congress for a revamp to federal permitting.

Members of the Senate pushing for a deal were looking to keep up momentum after the House passed its version: the “SPEED Act.”

But with Democrats taking a step back and Lee pushing a partisan approach, the talks could be dead in the water.

Betting on climate failure

A new wave of investors is financing companies that aim to limit the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth — while also potentially destabilizing weather patterns, food supplies and global politics.

Solar geoengineering investors are generally young, pragmatic and imaginative. They often shrug off the concerns of scientists who argue it’s inherently risky to fund the potentially dangerous technologies through wealthy investors who could only profit if the planet-cooling systems are deployed.

But Corbin Hiar reports that more than 50 financial firms, wealthy individuals and government agencies have collectively provided more than $115 million to nine startups whose technology could be used to limit sunlight, according to interviews with VCs, tech company founders and analysts, as well as private investment data analyzed by POLITICO’s E&E News.

Trump’s 2025

The administration’s first year in office has in many ways outdone the Trump team’s entire first term when it comes to squeezing the bureaucracy, slashing environmental regulations and weeding out climate programs, Robin Bravender writes.

“What they did, how fast they did it, the scope and the impact of what they did is simply stunning,” said Don Kettl, professor emeritus and former dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy.

Interviews and a review of 2025 found three big factors at play: First, the Trump team’s years in exile during Joe Biden’s presidency gave it time to draft a playbook. Second, Trump’s support for Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s approach to cutting government sped up the dismantling of agencies. Third, the administration has tested legal boundaries.

What’s old is new

Trump said Monday he has spoken to major U.S. oil companies about returning to Venezuela once leader Nicolás Maduro is out of power, James Bikales reports.

Venezuela holds some of the world’s largest oil reserves. POLITICO first reported last week that the Trump administration had solicited industry interest in returning to the oil fields decades after they were nationalized.

The OMB is the last stop before an agency releases a rule for public comment, though it can often take months for OMB to complete its review. About one-third of agency proposals have been at OMB longer than 90 days.

The 45Z rule went from Treasury to OMB on Dec. 17. The OMB posting was first reported by Ethanol Producer Magazine.

Biofuel groups declined to comment to DTN on the proposed 45Z rule because they do not know the specific details sent from Treasury to the White House.

Initially created in the Inflation Reduction Act, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act extended the tax credit to the end of 2029 and modified qualifications for it as well.

The tax credit uses the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy Use in Technologies Model -- known as the GREET model -- to calculate carbon intensity scores of biofuels. The model is also being adjusted because the OBBBA eliminated the calculation of international indirect land-use changes from the model when establishing carbon scores.

Also. under OBBBA, feedstocks used for 45Z must come from the U.S., Canada or Mexico, which shuts out products such as used cooking oil from China.

The OBBBA cuts the top rate for 45Z from $1.75 a gallon to $1 a gallon. Transportation fuels developed from animal manure would also qualify for the credit.

Along with Treasury, USDA will eventually be expected to finalize or require the interim Technical Guidance for ""Climate-Smart Agriculture Crops Used as Biofuel Feedstocks"" issued in the final days of the Biden administration. An analysis by the American Farm Bureau Federation noted, ""USDA has largely turned away from labeling conservation practices as 'climate-smart.'""

While the tax credit is for biofuel producers, the 45Z is expected to help boost incomes for farmers using practices that help a biofuel plant lower its CI score.

AFBF noted in its analysis, ""It is also important to reiterate that there is no requirement for biofuel producers to pass any of their earning from 45Z on to the farmers who produced their feedstocks.""

That was actually some of the basis behind the Partnership for Climate-Smart Commodities and IRA conservation funds under the Biden administration. Those programs were expected to help incentivize farmers to adopt practices that would then sell into more valuable commodities because of lower carbon footprints.

AFBF's Market Intel report on the 45Z from July:

https://www.fb.org/…

Note: DTN is part of one of the Partnership for Climate-Smart Commodities projects, ""Farmers for Soil Health,"" which is focused on increasing long-term cover crop adoption and creating a marketplace to generate demand for climate-smart commodities. The partnership involves farmers in at least 19 states who grow corn and soybeans. The USDA program has been renamed into Advancing Markets for Producers (AMP).

Egypt has for years been pushing to secure foreign investments, especially from wealthy Gulf states, as it seeks to tackle heavy foreign debts and a gaping budget deficit.

Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said the project ""reflects the positive momentum in relations between Cairo and Doha, driven by the shared political will to advance bilateral cooperation through joint investments and increased trade.""

Last month, the real estate arm of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund said it would invest $29.7 B to develop a luxury real estate and tourism project on Egypt's Mediterranean coast.

That deal marked the largest Qatari investment in the country since diplomatic relations were restored following a 2017–2021 economic rift when Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain cut ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism and aligning too closely with Iran, charges Doha denied.

As the year winds down, we humans typically reflect on what went well and not-so-well over the previous twelve months. A question that business leaders must consider today is, “How accountable are leaders and team members for delivering both results and respect?”

Over the past 35 years, our research reveals that accountability for results (performance expectations) in organizations around the globe is wildly inconsistent. Contributing factors typically include:

Poorly defined or a lack of specific expectations

Team members don’t have the skills, training, or tools required to meet expectations

Little to no regular monitoring or check-ins

Leaders don’t know how to coach team members to consistently meet expectations

Accountability for respect (values, expectations) varies as well, from inconsistent to completely absent. The factors driving this reality often include:

Poorly defined or a lack of observable, tangible and measurable valued behaviors

Little to no measurement of values alignment of leaders by their direct reports

Leaders don’t have the skills, training or tools to effectively coach for values alignment

Leaders tolerate toxic behaviors (by leaders and team members), which encourages demeaning treatment

Our accountability model puts the initial responsibility for holding people accountable for results and respect on the shoulders of formal leaders. We coach leaders in five accountability practices: model, celebrate, measure, coach and mentor. Building skills in these practices improves demonstrated respect and delivered results.

Over time, if team members see their leaders holding others accountable, frontline staff proactively engage in accountability conversations with their peers.

The WD40 Company accelerated this process, with remarkable impact. Garry Ridge and the company leaders decided to help every tribe member take initiative, ask questions, make decisions and share information proactively. How? Through a commitment to the “Maniac Pledge.”

“I am responsible for taking action, asking questions, getting answers and making decisions. I won’t wait for someone to tell me. If I need to know, I’m responsible for asking. I have no right to be offended that I didn’t ‘get this sooner.’ If I’m doing something others should know about, I’m responsible for telling them.”

Embedding the Maniac Pledge into daily operations and interactions shifted the responsibility from leaders driving accountability for results and respect to every leader and tribe member driving accountability themselves.

The impact on respect and results is impressive. Engagement is consistently at 90%+, along with record net sales and exceeding targets in gross margin and net income growth.

We fear there may be two other reasons the Trump administration has yet to move on 45Z.
There is still time for the Trump administration to get this right, but they must move quickly.
If the department includes regenerative ag practices in 45Z, the incentives for regenerative practices in 45Z dwarf the resources available in the administration’s $700 million initiative.","American corn and soybean farmers are hurting. Trump’s trade war has raised fertilizer and other input costs while suppressing prices. The worst part is that international markets may not come back soon as trading partners like China turn to Brazilian farmers to supply their needs.

This means that domestic markets for U.S. commodities are critical. Biofuels markets today for soybeans and corn use 45% of soybean oil and 40% of corn production. And today’s biofuels are good for the environment with one peer-reviewed study showing greenhouse gas emissions that are 46% lower than fossil fuels. That’s why there is bipartisan support, as evidenced by the extension of the 45Z tax credit, which rewards fuel producers that produce low-carbon biofuels with fewer GHGs.

In the beginning of this year, then-Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced a new rule establishing the guidelines for quantifying, reporting, and verifying the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of biofuel feedstock commodity crops grown in the United States. Under 45Z, biofuel manufacturers who produce fuels lower in carbon intensity than petroleum based fuels can receive a $1 per gallon tax credit.

In order to meet that threshold, those manufacturers will need to lower their carbon intensity and that could include contracting with farmers who produce low carbon corn and soybeans using practices such as cover crops, conservation tillage, and enhanced efficiency fertilizers. Farmers can therefore expect higher prices for their commodities.

In making the announcement Vilsack said, “The new guidelines are a win for farmers, biofuel producers, the public, and the environment. The action today marks an important milestone in the development of market-based conservation opportunities for agriculture.”

The two of us worked on the 45Z tax credit and, frankly, we were frustrated that the Biden administration wasn’t able to finalize the rule so it could take immediate effect. The Treasury Department was unwilling to adopt the rule in its tax guidance on 45Z without a public comment period on the portion of the rule that measured carbon intensity associated with biofuels. In essence, we ran the ball to the two-yard line with the expectation that the Trump administration would run it into the end zone in a matter of a few weeks.

That comment period concluded in the early spring and yet months later, the Trump administration has yet to even try to move the ball. Why?

It’s not because the administration is opposed to farmers adopting what we called climate-smart agricultural practices and what they call regenerative practices. Earlier this month, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, along with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a $700 million Regenerative Pilot Program to help American farmers adopt practices that improve soil health, enhance water quality, and boost long-term productivity.

And while the initiative doesn’t actually create any new financial resources for farmers, the practices that will help farmers produce lower carbon feedstocks to make ethanol, biodiesel, and sustainable aviation fuel that Tom Vilsack was talking about in January are the same tools in the Trump administration’s announcement. Planting cover crops, reducing or eliminating tillage, improving the timing and quantity of fertilizer, and employing technology to more precisely apply crop inputs are the same tools that would be used in producing lower carbon feedstocks and in improving the health of our soil.

We fear there may be two other reasons the Trump administration has yet to move on 45Z. First, the Administration has been friendly to fossil fuel interests who have traditionally opposed biofuel initiatives. And second, there is no champion – no Tom Vilsack -- for biofuels policy within the Trump administration.

There is still time for the Trump administration to get this right, but they must move quickly. The Treasury Department is currently writing the regulation that will be used for the clean fuel production tax credit, known as 45Z.

Treasury can choose to include the regenerative practices that will both create new market opportunities for struggling farmers and lead to healthier soil and cleaner water … or it can opt to leave them out. If the department includes regenerative ag practices in 45Z, the incentives for regenerative practices in 45Z dwarf the resources available in the administration’s $700 million initiative.

It meets the demand of domestic transportation industries, it opens markets overseas where customers want lower carbon liquid fuels, and it creates market-based opportunities for farmers to increase their profitability even as they help reduce emissions.

Because of these limits, SAF supply is expected to stay tight relative to demand through at least the late 2020s.
Large buyers around the world are seeking stable SAF supply to meet regulatory targets and sustainability goals.
As SAF production capacity expands slowly, long-term agreements and supportive policies will be vital to growing the market.","On December 16, 2025, DHL Express confirmed a new fuel agreement. The company signed a binding offtake contract with the renewable fuels producer Neste. Under this deal, DHL will receive 50 million liters of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for deliveries in 2026.

The fuel will be used in DHL’s air cargo flights to help reduce carbon emissions. This deal is one of the first under the tightened ReFuelEU Aviation rules, which increase SAF requirements at European airports starting in 2026.

DHL moved early to lock in supply. The company expects SAF prices to rise once the new rules begin in January. Securing supply now helps DHL manage future costs and ensure fuel availability as demand grows.

ReFuelEU Aviation: Redrawing the Fuel Mix

The ReFuelEU Aviation regulation is part of the European Union’s plan to cut aviation emissions. The regulation sets minimum shares of SAF that fuel suppliers must deliver at EU airports. These required shares increase each year. The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from flights over time.

In 2025, fuel suppliers must blend about 2% SAF into jet fuel at EU airports. This percentage increases to 6% by 2030 under the regulation. Rules will continue rising toward 70% by 2050. Aircraft operators that fail to meet these requirements may face penalties.

These mandates follow global climate goals, including the aviation industry’s pledge to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. SAF is central to these plans because it can cut lifecycle CO₂ emissions compared with traditional jet fuel.

However, SAF remains more costly and less widely produced than conventional jet fuel. That has raised concerns about supply, prices, and the ability of airlines and cargo carriers to meet future mandates.

The EU aims to help address this by revealing a $108 billion investment plan to help decarbonize the sector. The funding will help ramp up the production and use of cleaner fuels like SAF for aviation and maritime.

Why DHL’s SAF Contract Matters? Net Zero Goals and Emissions Reduction Progress

DHL’s contract with Neste covers 50 million liters of SAF for delivery in 2026. The fuel will help power part of DHL’s air cargo flights in Europe. Neste will supply SAF made from renewable waste and residue materials. These feedstocks reduce lifecycle emissions compared with fossil fuels.

This agreement puts DHL among the early adopters of SAF under the new EU rule changes. It shows the growing role of long-term fuel contracts in securing carbon-reducing fuels. These contracts also help SAF producers plan and finance future production capacity.

Deals like DHL’s offer two key benefits:

Price certainty: Buyers secure fuel at a set price before markets tighten and costs rise.

Supply assurance: Long-term contracts guarantee volumes when the total SAF supply is limited.

For logistic operators like DHL, these benefits help manage operational costs and regulatory compliance. Beyond these is the environmental benefit for the logistics company.

DHL Group has committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 across all its logistics operations. This target aligns with global climate goals and covers air, road, and supply chain activities.

To stay on track, DHL has set clear interim goals and actions:

Cut total emissions to below 29 million metric tons of CO₂e by 2030, down from about 40 million metric tons.

Increase the use of sustainable fuels, including SAF, across air freight operations.

Source over 30 percent of transport fuels from sustainable alternatives by 2030.

Electrify more than 66% of last-mile delivery vehicles used for parcel delivery.

Improve fuel efficiency through better flight planning, routing, and load optimization.

Work with fuel suppliers and partners to secure long-term SAF supply contracts.

DHL has already begun using SAF on selected air routes and has signed multiple long-term fuel agreements, including this recent one with Neste. These steps help reduce emissions now while preparing for tighter climate rules in the coming years.

Inside the Global SAF Supply Crunch

The SAF market is still small compared with overall aviation fuel demand. Current production is limited but growing. In 2023, global SAF output climbed to around 600 million liters—about double the 300 million liters produced in 2022.

Total SAF in 2024 reached about 1.3 billion liters (nearly 1 million tonnes) worldwide. Even with this growth, SAF accounted for only about 0.3% of global jet fuel use in 2024.

Despite these gains, production remains far below what is needed to meet future emissions targets. According to industry forecasts, global SAF output could grow sixteen-fold by 2030 to roughly 6.1–8.2 billion gallons per year (about 23–31 billion liters). Other reports estimate SAF production near 10 billion liters by 2030.

Even with this expansion, SAF would still represent a small share of total aviation fuel demand unless growth accelerates well beyond these projections.

In addition to volume limits, SAF supply faces other challenges:

High costs: SAF currently costs two to five times more than conventional jet fuel in many markets.

Feedstock limits: SAF feedstocks, such as used cooking oil and agricultural residues, are in demand from other industries, which limits scaling potential.

Infrastructure gaps: Distribution and blending facilities are still being built in many regions.

Because of these limits, SAF supply is expected to stay tight relative to demand through at least the late 2020s.

Growth Forecasts Meet Real-World Constraints

Despite challenges, the SAF market is forecast to grow strongly as policy mandates and corporate commitments expand.

Market analysts project the global SAF market value at around US$2.06–2.08 billion in 2025. By 2030, the industry could reach US$25–26 billion. This implies a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) above 60 percent through the late 2020s.

In terms of production volume, analysts expect large increases, with forecasts ranging from several billion gallons per year by 2030. The expansion reflects rising demand due to regulatory pressure, corporate sustainability goals, and growing aviation activity.

By 2050, much larger SAF volumes may be necessary. One global industry assessment suggests the aviation sector may need around 500 million tonnes of SAF by 2050 to achieve net-zero emissions.

Currently, global SAF production is only about 2 million tonnes and represents less than 1 percent of total aviation fuel consumption. Bridging the gap will require dramatic increases in production capacity and feedstock supply over the next 25 years.

What This Signals for Aviation’s Low-Carbon Shift

DHL’s 50 million-liter SAF agreement with Neste highlights several key trends in aviation fuel markets:

Early action: Fuel buyers are signing long-term contracts ahead of tighter regulations.

Supply competition: With limited SAF output, early offtake deals secure fuel before wider market tightening.

Growing corporate role: Logistics firms and airlines are increasingly active buyers of SAF.

Market scale-up: SAF volumes are rising, but still far short of future demand needs.

DHL’s contract is not an isolated case. Large buyers around the world are seeking stable SAF supply to meet regulatory targets and sustainability goals. As SAF production capacity expands slowly, long-term agreements and supportive policies will be vital to growing the market.

The company’s early move shows how policy changes are shaping business decisions today rather than in the distant future. In this environment, SAF is no longer a niche fuel. It is becoming a necessary part of the future aviation fuel supply.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2624719791.jpg,N,,2025-12-23 10:12:05.342185

But the message from the senior US official was clear: after almost two decades of estrangement between Washington and socialist governments in Bolivia, a new political, commercial and diplomatic era had begun.
Having campaigned with promises of “capitalism for all”, Paz has said this new era is “going to open Bolivia to the world and the world to Bolivia”.
But this “opening up”, combined with shifting geopolitics in the region, have left some observers fearful that environmental protections could be loosened in pursuit of economic development.
According to data collected by Gandarillas, between 2010 and 2019, Bolivia signed 38 bilateral agreements with China.","On the night of 19 October, Rodrigo Paz was celebrating his victory in the second-round runoff of the Bolivian elections when he received a call. Christopher Landau, the United States deputy secretary of state, representing Donald Trump’s government, had called to congratulate the new president.

Paz himself drew attention to this communication during his first public appearance, after the announcement of a win for his centre-right Christian Democratic Party, with 54% of the votes, over Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga’s Libre alliance.

That night, several world leaders and heads of state contacted Paz. But the message from the senior US official was clear: after almost two decades of estrangement between Washington and socialist governments in Bolivia, a new political, commercial and diplomatic era had begun.

The new president said this would be “a close relationship”. In the weeks before taking office on 8 November, Paz made a visit to the United States in search of support to resolve an economic and energy crisis that has gripped Bolivia since early 2023. Upon returning from his trip, he told Bolivian business leaders that his team had “already secured the dollars, petrol and diesel that we so desperately need”.

Recommended

Washington has seen the change of government as an opportunity to rebuild diplomatic ties that had been strained since 2008, when then-president Evo Morales declared former US ambassador Philip Goldberg persona non grata, accusing him of leading the “division of Bolivia”. In a statement from the US Embassy on 20 October, secretary of state Marco Rubio said that his country “is ready to partner with Bolivia on shared priorities”.

On the other side of global geopolitics, China – Bolivia’s main trading partner during the leftist governments of Evo Morales (2006-2019) and Luis Arce (2021-2025) – also congratulated Paz, days after the election results were announced. On Friday, 24 October, Chinese leader Xi Jinping sent a message to the president, in which he said that since the establishment of their diplomatic relations 40 years ago, bilateral ties “have maintained good momentum for development”.

Parsifal D’Sola, director of the Andrés Bello Foundation, which studies relations between China and Latin America, said he was sure a call with Chinese officials would also have taken place on the night of Paz’s victory. “I have no proof, but I have no doubt that one of the first calls received by the new government was from China, precisely to initiate a new conversation, develop a new relationship, and find out exactly what the positions are,” he told Dialogue Earth.

Paz has taken office in a context of deep economic crisis, reflected in a 2.4% fall in GDP in the first half of 2025, and on 17 December declared the country to be in an “economic emergency”. The new president is seeking to move beyond the long-standing socialist ideology that has governed Bolivia, pursue international support, and set a new direction for his government. Having campaigned with promises of “capitalism for all”, Paz has said this new era is “going to open Bolivia to the world and the world to Bolivia”.

But this “opening up”, combined with shifting geopolitics in the region, have left some observers fearful that environmental protections could be loosened in pursuit of economic development.

“We are in a very complex economic situation, the result of economic decisions taken over the last decade,” said Óscar Campanini, a sociologist specialising in environment and development, and director of the Bolivian Centre for Documentation and Information (Cedib), an NGO. “In this context it is possible that environmental and social requirements could be relaxed, under the pretext of facilitating foreign investment.”

Bolivia in the spotlight

Bolivia and China have had diplomatic relations since 1985. In 2006, with the arrival to power of Evo Morales and his Movement for Socialism, those ties began to grow from simple exchanges of ambassadors and helped contribute to making China, today, Bolivia’s main trading partner.

“From 2010 onwards, it is clear that investments involving Chinese cooperation intensified,” said Marco Gandarillas, a senior researcher at the environmental organisation Latinoamérica Sustentable (LAS). China is Bolivia’s main bilateral creditor, with loans mainly for infrastructure. In addition, its companies – state-owned, private and mixed – have become the main contractors for road works. Gandarillas, who is soon to publish a report focused on Chinese investments in the country, told Dialogue Earth that according to his calculations, more than 1,466 kilometres of roads and bridges have been built by Chinese companies in the Bolivian Amazon alone. He said that these are key to connecting rivers, which also serve as important routes for transit and trade in these often remote regions.

According to data collected by Gandarillas, between 2010 and 2019, Bolivia signed 38 bilateral agreements with China. Citing research on economic cooperation agreements and national ratification laws, he counts 16 Chinese loans totalling over USD 2 billion and during that period; other sources tracking Chinese overseas finance have put this figure even higher, at over USD 3 billion. Alongside significant support for a planned hydroelectric dam and a vast steel project, much of this financing went towards three major road infrastructure projects: the Rurrenabaque–Riberalta highway, the El Sillar dual carriageway and the Espino–Charagua–Boyuibe highway.

The latest data available on the official website of the Central Bank of Bolivia refers to a debt with China of USD 1.37 billion as of June 2024.

Ning Leng, a professor of political science at Georgetown University whose research has focused on China and its overseas finance, told Dialogue Earth that China has three key interests in Bolivia: minerals such as lithium; agriculture, especially soybeans; and infrastructure, which is the area where it has had the greatest impact.

Analysts agree that the arrival of a new government, far from generating suspicion in China due to economic and geopolitical rivalry with the United States, is an opportunity to reaffirm ties.

“The pragmatic approach that Beijing has adopted with centre-right or right-wing leaders – Bolsonaro in Brazil, or Milei in Argentina – is an example of how China can adapt to political changes in the region without affecting or compromising its foreign policy objectives,” said Carlos Piña, a political scientist specialising in China-Latin America relations.

In the case of Argentina, Javier Milei recently received new financial support from the Trump administration, amounting to USD 20 billion, without this interfering with previous projects and initiatives that his left-wing predecessors, Cristina Fernández and Alberto Fernández, had established with China.

The same thing happened with Brazil. At present, relations between China and President Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva are “comprehensively strategic”, researcher Gandarillas said, but he added that they had also largely been so when the far-right Jair Bolsonaro was in power from 2019 to 2022.

In Bolivia, the letter sent by Chinese leader Xi Jinping to his counterpart Rodrigo Paz indicated a similar consistency, and goes further, offering to take the China-Bolivia strategic partnership “to a new level” of “comprehensive strategic”, an official designation in Chinese diplomacy. This is the level of relations China has determined with other South American countries, including Brazil and Venezuela, explained Gandarillas.

From necessity to environmental flexibility

Construction projects led by Chinese companies in Bolivia, and across Latin America, in recent decades have often met with environmental and social concerns, although in 2024 China accepted a number of recommendations from the UN Human Rights Council in relation to its overseas investments, including to consider more robust legislation incorporating the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.

Analysts such as Campanini of Cedib and Gandarillas from Latinoamerica Sustentable are concerned that the new Bolivian government has so far shown a great imbalance between its emphasis on economic and environmental issues. “In the name of saving the crisis, we will end up raffling off or sacrificing areas, ecosystems and communities that subsist on very valuable resources,” said Campanini.

Indigenous peoples of the Bolivian Amazon and civil society organisations have voiced similar concerns, particularly following the recent dissolution of the Ministry of the Environment, which has been merged into a unified Ministry of Development Planning and the Environment. Furthermore, the appointment of agro-industrial businessman José Fernando Romero Pinto as minister for the new department prompted the Block of Peasant and Indigenous Organisations of the Northern Amazon of Bolivia (Bocinab) to declare a “state of alert”, further describing their concern on the changes to the environment ministry, and around a reported “strengthening of the Ministry of Mining and Metallurgy”.

Speaking to Dialogue Earth, Bocinab founder Luis Rojas Mogrovejo said they would not allow further mining activity in their territories, which have already been affected by mercury pollution. At a time when the new government is seen to be organising itself to try to lift the country’s economy, Jenny Duri, president of the Yaminahua-Machineri Indigenous Peasant Territory, told Dialogue Earth that “mining in our territory is a danger”.

The Paz administration has rejected initial criticisms around its environmental prospects, emphasising that it sees development and environment as complimentary rather than opposing forces, and pitching its ministry reshuffle as breaking down a disconnect between conservation and production.

In an interview with Dialogue Earth, Jorge Ávila, vice-minister of environment, biodiversity, climate change and forest management and development, said that Bolivia “is not in a position to abandon development, because the country is bankrupt, which doesn’t mean we’re going to disregard the environmental aspect”.

An attorney with experience in environmental, forestry and public policy issues, Ávila argued that Bolivia needs to abandon an approach that sees certain sectors forced to comply with environmental regulations “as if it were a punishment”. On the contrary, “we have to persuade and demonstrate that by doing things right from an environmental perspective, we are creating better conditions for development in our country”.",https://dialogue.earth/content/uploads/2025/12/A-shepherd-looks-after-her-sheep-in-the-Bolivian-highlands_Arianna-Rosso_Flickr_fae992032a_cropped-1200px-copy.jpeg,N,,2025-12-23 10:12:17.015310

Sarla Aviation had a little over ten people working on engineering and conceptualisation nine months ago, and now, it has a team of nearly 70 engineers.
It has raised $13 million dollars (approximately €11 million euros) to date to support its first air taxi project.
Rakesh Gaonkar, the co-founder and CTO of Sarla Aviation, holds a much stronger background in automotive design, having worked at GM, Italdesign, Mahindra & Mahindra, Citroën, Audi, Nio, and BMW, as well as Lilium.","Sarla Aviation has developed a half-scale electric eVTOL called ‘Sylla SYL-X1,’ featuring a 7.5- metre wingspan. The company says this is the country’s largest and most advanced private eVTOL of its kind.

The Bengaluru-based startup developed the Sylla SYL-X1 in just about nine months, with significantly lower capital outlay compared to most global eVTOL programmes. The company has begun ground testing, marking the key transition from virtual development and laboratory-scale work to its core validation phase. It is using the half-scale prototype to assess the structural behaviour, the integration of the propulsion system, and the overall safety system.

In a brief conversation with electrive.com about the new phase of development, Sarla Aviation stated that the Sylla SYL-X1 is fully electric, but the production version will have a hybrid system to enable longer-range operations. The company plans to carry forward the name of the concept it unveiled at this year’s Bharat Mobility Expo, ’Shunya,’ with a suffix for the 15-metre full-scale aircraft. Sarla Aviation had a little over ten people working on engineering and conceptualisation nine months ago, and now, it has a team of nearly 70 engineers.

It has raised $13 million dollars (approximately €11 million euros) to date to support its first air taxi project. Adrian Schmidt, the company’s co-founder and CEO, previously worked in design roles at prominent carmakers like Mercedes-Benz, Nio, and Volkswagen, as well as German air taxi startup Lilium. Rakesh Gaonkar, the co-founder and CTO of Sarla Aviation, holds a much stronger background in automotive design, having worked at GM, Italdesign, Mahindra & Mahindra, Citroën, Audi, Nio, and BMW, as well as Lilium.

Commenting on the commencement of ground testing, Gaonkar said: “This milestone reflects what’s possible when globally experienced Indian engineering teams build with rigour, patience, and world-class standards. Our focus has never been on being first, but on building to last — on creating an aviation giant.”

Earlier this month, Sarla Aviation signed an MoU with Goa, a popular tourist state along India’s west coast, to jointly evaluate deploying air taxis across the state. If the plan succeeds, this could make Goa India’s first Coastal Aerial Mobility State. Last month, the company signed an MoU with its home state, Karnataka, to explore the launch of its air taxi from airports and city centres to the flagship properties of Jungle Lodges & Resorts, a state-owned wildlife and eco-tourism company.

The Shunya concept Sarla Aviation introduced in January is a six-seat hybrid electric air taxi powered by seven electric motors that can provide speeds of up to 250 km/h.Two battery packs can help it fly up to 150 kilometres, and a SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) tank can extend the range to up to 800 kilometres. The company will build the production version at a new factory in Thimmasamudram, a village in Andhra Pradesh, a neighbouring state of Karnataka.",https://www.electrive.com/media/2025/12/sarla-aviation-sylla-syl-x1-cropped.jpeg,N,,2025-12-23 10:12:23.586991

The Freight Partner That Shapes Your Next Growth Stage

Picking a freight forwarder is not just a logistics decision. It is a decision about reliability, cash flow, customer trust, and how confidently you can expand into new markets. The five companies in this list succeed for different reasons. Some win on global scale and carrier access, some win on deep industry specialization, and some win on technology that makes complex shipping feel manageable.

What stands out in 2026 is how quickly expectations are changing. Businesses now want instant quoting, clear documentation, real time visibility, and support that does not disappear outside office hours. They also want options that reduce waste and emissions as sustainability standards tighten across supply chains.

If you are an SMB building international lanes, Ship4wd is designed to remove friction and make global freight feel attainable. If you need breadth, capacity, and mature infrastructure across multiple regions, the long established global providers can be a strong fit.

Through her work on SAF emissions, she highlights the importance of including occupational health considerations in national and international aviation sustainability agendas.
The findings from her study are expected to contribute to ongoing discussions by research boards, regulatory agencies, and technical committees working toward safer and cleaner aviation systems.","In recent years, the global aviation sector has faced mounting pressure to reduce its environmental footprint while safeguarding the health of the workers who support its operations. Against this backdrop, Onyinye Ezeifeka, a Nigerian doctoral researcher specializing in industrial hygiene and air quality assessment at the University of Cincinnati, USA, has emerged as one of the early-career scientists investigating how the transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) could shape occupational exposures in aviation environments.

Her research focuses on understanding turbine engine emissions produced when SAFs and SAF–jet fuel blends are combusted, and how these emissions may influence human health outcomes among aviation personnel. The work is part of a broader scientific effort to evaluate whether SAFs, widely promoted for their ability to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, also lead to measurable improvements in near-field air quality for workers such as aircraft mechanics, ground crew, and fuel handlers.

Ezeifeka’s project integrates aerosol science, occupational exposure assessment, and combustion chemistry. Working within the University of Cincinnati’s Safe Air Lab, she examines particle size distributions, organic pollutant composition, and toxicological profiles of emissions generated from controlled turbine engine combustion scenarios using laboratory-grade SAF samples. Her team employs advanced aerosol measurement tools, including the Fast Mobility Particle Sizer (FMPS), Optical Particle Sizer (OPS), and other real-time monitoring instruments, to characterize nanoparticulates and volatile organic compounds formed during SAF combustion.

The study is one of the emerging efforts in the United States to link aviation decarbonization strategies with worker health. While international regulatory bodies have emphasized lifecycle carbon reduction metrics, far less attention has been given to the potential occupational implications of fuel transitions. Ezeifeka’s work aims to fill this gap by producing data that aviation authorities, airport operators, aircraft manufacturers, and occupational health agencies can use to guide evidence- based decisions regarding SAF deployment.

Her interest in the topic reflects a broader scientific trajectory rooted in environmental health and exposure science. Building on her earlier training in soil science and environmental contamination, she brings an interdisciplinary lens that connects emissions behavior with real-world exposure pathways. Colleagues describe her research approach as structured, methodical, and guided by a strong commitment to worker safety.

The project also positions her as part of a growing network of African researchers contributing meaningfully to global environmental and technological transitions. Through her work on SAF emissions, she highlights the importance of including occupational health considerations in national and international aviation sustainability agendas. The findings from her study are expected to contribute to ongoing discussions by research boards, regulatory agencies, and technical committees working toward safer and cleaner aviation systems.",https://s0.wp.com/_si/?t=eyJpbWciOiJodHRwczpcL1wvczAud3AuY29tXC9pXC9ibGFuay5qcGciLCJ0eHQiOiJUcmlidW5lIE9ubGluZSIsInRlbXBsYXRlIjoiaGlnaHdheSIsImZvbnQiOiIiLCJibG9nX2lkIjoxMTgxMjU0MTZ9.Kju_pXaRyR2Z40XcTS8-y2H-HoZsNyF8tY0m8Vf5wHcMQ,N,,2025-12-23 10:12:47.147416

As airlines worldwide intensify efforts to achieve ambitious decarbonization targets, the sector confronts significant obstacles. In particular, fragmented and costly government policies—especially across Europe—have hindered SAF production and escalated costs. Industry leaders warn that these regulatory complexities threaten to undermine the aviation sector’s capacity to scale SAF usage, jeopardizing progress toward net-zero emissions by 2050.

Challenges in SAF Production and Distribution

FlyORO, a Singapore-based technology company, is at the forefront of addressing these challenges by developing novel approaches to SAF distribution. The firm’s patented modular blending units can be deployed flexibly from production sites to airports, facilitating a more distributed and responsive delivery network. McLoughlin underscores that while much of the industry’s focus remains on SAF production, significant difficulties persist downstream in the supply chain. Without localized and adaptable solutions, he cautions, the sector risks creating disparities between airports—some gaining access to SAF while others are left behind.

The global SAF landscape remains uneven. Europe continues to struggle with policy fragmentation, impeding cohesive growth. In contrast, Asia currently stands as the only region experiencing tangible expansion in SAF capacity. Australia, despite recent momentum in its SAF transition, still lacks the structural certainty, coordinated government support, and clear investment signals necessary to establish a sustainable domestic industry. Aviation leaders in Australia emphasize that without these foundational elements, the country will face considerable challenges in building a viable SAF supply chain.

Emerging Pressures and Solutions

Compounding these issues is the rapid growth of artificial intelligence technologies, whose soaring energy demands increasingly compete for the same renewable energy resources required for SAF production. This competition poses a further risk to airlines’ sustainability ambitions.

In response to these complexities, demand is rising for SAF certificates and greater flexibility in accounting for Scope 3 emissions. McLoughlin highlights the critical role of robust traceability and the “book-and-claim” system, which enables airlines to claim environmental benefits from SAF even when physical delivery is not feasible. He argues that this mechanism is essential for scaling SAF demand and maintaining credibility, as it complements physical deployment with transparent and accountable tracking.

While experts acknowledge that the aviation industry is unlikely to meet its 2030 targets for sustainable fuel adoption, innovations such as FlyORO’s modular blending technology and an emphasis on traceable, flexible supply chains offer promising avenues.

(NYSE: LUCK).
Formerly known as Bowlero Corp before its late 2024 rebranding, Lucky Strike has been a poster child for the location-based entertainment trend.
The sell-off comes as Lucky Strike shares have struggled, trading down approximately 13% year-over-year at $9.02, despite reporting double-digit revenue growth.
In the entertainment space, the reduction in Lucky Strike Entertainment Corp. (NYSE: LUCK) reflects a broader skepticism toward ""high-touch"" brick-and-mortar businesses.
What Comes Next: Strategic Pivots and Market Hurdles Looking ahead, both Calumet and Lucky Strike face critical junctures in 2026.","In a series of strategic maneuvers that have caught the attention of mid-cap investors, Alta Fundamental Advisers has significantly reshaped its portfolio as of late 2025. The New York-based hedge fund, known for its deep-value approach and focus on special situations, has completely liquidated its position in Calumet, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLMT) and slashed its stake in Lucky Strike Entertainment Corp. (NYSE: LUCK) by nearly half. These moves, revealed in recent regulatory filings and market data, suggest a growing caution regarding capital-intensive businesses grappling with high leverage and shifting consumer or regulatory landscapes.

The timing of these exits is particularly noteworthy as the market enters the final weeks of 2025. While the broader indices have shown resilience, Alta’s decision to pull back from these specific names highlights a divergence in sentiment between high-growth narratives and the harsh reality of balance sheet constraints. For Calumet, the exit marks the end of a long-standing institutional relationship, while the reduction in Lucky Strike signals a re-evaluation of the ""experiential economy"" that dominated post-pandemic investment themes.

A Strategic Liquidation: The Numbers Behind the Moves

According to SEC filings released in November 2025 and subsequent market activity through December 22, 2025, Alta Fundamental Advisers executed a total exit from Calumet, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLMT). The fund sold its remaining 459,937 shares, a position previously valued at approximately $7.25 million. This liquidation follows a period of significant transition for Calumet, which shifted from a Master Limited Partnership (MLP) to a C-Corporation in mid-2024. Despite the company’s efforts to attract a wider institutional base through this conversion and its aggressive push into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) via its Montana Renewables subsidiary, Alta appears to have lost patience with the company's persistent debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which hovered near 9x earlier in the year.

Simultaneously, Alta turned its attention to the entertainment sector, specifically Lucky Strike Entertainment Corp. (NYSE: LUCK). Formerly known as Bowlero Corp before its late 2024 rebranding, Lucky Strike has been a poster child for the location-based entertainment trend. However, Alta reduced its exposure by selling nearly 1.1 million shares, a move valued at roughly $8.73 million. While the fund still retains a 4.78% stake in the company—down from over 10% earlier in the year—the reduction is a clear signal of cooling enthusiasm. The sell-off comes as Lucky Strike shares have struggled, trading down approximately 13% year-over-year at $9.02, despite reporting double-digit revenue growth.

The timeline of these events suggests a calculated year-end rebalancing. The bulk of the selling occurred during the third quarter of 2025, with the final tranches of the Calumet position cleared by late October. Market observers note that Alta’s primary focus has shifted toward more stable cash-flow generators, such as Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI), which remains the fund's largest holding, accounting for over 20% of its total assets under management.

Winners and Losers in the Wake of Alta’s Exit

The immediate losers of this institutional retreat are undoubtedly the target companies themselves. For Calumet, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLMT), the loss of a fundamental-oriented backer like Alta could pressure the stock price in the short term, especially as the company seeks to finalize crucial Department of Energy (DOE) loans for its renewable projects. The exit may signal to other institutional players that the ""turnaround story"" for Calumet is taking longer than anticipated, potentially leading to a ""show me"" period where the stock remains range-bound until debt levels are meaningfully addressed.

On the other hand, larger, more liquid energy competitors like Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE: VLO) or Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) may emerge as winners. As funds like Alta rotate out of high-leverage specialty refiners, they often seek refuge in blue-chip energy names with stronger balance sheets and more diversified revenue streams. These ""refining giants"" are better positioned to weather the volatility in crack spreads and the capital requirements of the energy transition, making them attractive alternatives for investors still wanting energy exposure without the idiosyncratic risks of a mid-cap player like Calumet.

In the entertainment space, the reduction in Lucky Strike Entertainment Corp. (NYSE: LUCK) reflects a broader skepticism toward ""high-touch"" brick-and-mortar businesses. While Lucky Strike has successfully integrated acquisitions like Boomers and various water parks, its net losses—driven by high interest expenses—have become a liability in a ""higher-for-longer"" interest rate environment. Winners in this sector are likely to be digital-first entertainment platforms or lean operators with minimal physical overhead, such as Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), which continue to capture discretionary spending without the burden of maintaining massive physical footprints.

Broader Significance: Energy Security and the Experiential Squeeze

Alta’s moves fit into a larger narrative defining the 2025 market: the collision of ambitious growth projects with fiscal reality. In the energy sector, the focus has shifted from pure ""green energy"" hype back to energy security and affordability. While Calumet’s Montana Renewables project is strategically aligned with the global push for SAF, the capital intensity of such projects is immense. As of December 2025, U.S. natural gas prices have spiked toward $4.30/MMBtu, increasing operational costs for refiners. Alta’s exit suggests that for some investors, the regulatory and operational risks of the energy transition no longer justify the wait for a deleveraging event.

In the entertainment sector, the ""experiential squeeze"" is becoming evident. Throughout 2024 and early 2025, consumers prioritized experiences over goods, benefiting companies like Lucky Strike. However, by late 2025, the cumulative effect of inflation and high borrowing costs has begun to weigh on discretionary spending. Lucky Strike’s model, which relies on continuous expansion and high operating leverage, is particularly vulnerable when consumer foot traffic slows or interest rates remain elevated. This mirror's historical precedents where over-leveraged roll-up strategies in the leisure sector faced significant headwinds during economic cooling periods.

Furthermore, these trades highlight a shift in institutional sentiment toward ""specialty"" plays. In a market where the S&P 500 has been dominated by a handful of tech giants, mid-cap specialty companies must prove their profitability more aggressively than ever. The ""growth at any cost"" mentality has been replaced by a ""cash flow at all costs"" requirement, leaving companies like Calumet and Lucky Strike in a precarious position as they navigate their respective growth phases.

What Comes Next: Strategic Pivots and Market Hurdles

Looking ahead, both Calumet and Lucky Strike face critical junctures in 2026. For Calumet, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLMT), the priority must be debt reduction and the successful scaling of Montana Renewables. If the company can secure its pending DOE loan and demonstrate consistent profitability in its SAF segment, it may be able to win back institutional confidence. However, any further delays in its renewable timeline or a downturn in specialty chemical margins could force the company into more drastic measures, such as asset sales or equity raises, which would be dilutive to remaining shareholders.

Lucky Strike Entertainment Corp. (NYSE: LUCK) is likely to pivot toward an ""optimization phase,"" slowing its aggressive acquisition pace to focus on internal efficiencies and debt servicing. The market will be watching its upcoming quarterly reports closely for signs of margin expansion. If the company can prove that its diversified portfolio of bowling alleys and amusement parks can generate consistent net income despite high interest costs, it may see a valuation recovery. Conversely, if losses continue to widen, the stock could face further institutional selling, potentially making it a target for private equity firms looking to take the brand private and restructure its debt away from the public eye.

In the short term, expect increased volatility for both tickers as the market digests the loss of a significant fundamental holder. Investors should watch for ""insider buying"" as a potential signal of confidence from management, or conversely, any further 13F filings from other hedge funds that might be following Alta’s lead out the door.

Summary and Investor Outlook

The exit of Alta Fundamental Advisers from Calumet and its reduction in Lucky Strike serves as a stark reminder of the risks inherent in mid-cap, high-leverage investments. The key takeaways for investors are clear: balance sheet health is paramount in 2025, and even the most promising growth stories—whether in renewable energy or experiential entertainment—can be derailed by the cost of capital. Alta’s rotation suggests a preference for more stable, cash-generating assets as the market navigates a complex macroeconomic environment.

Moving forward, the market for energy and entertainment will likely remain bifurcated. Companies with the scale and liquidity to self-fund their growth will thrive, while those reliant on debt markets will face continuous scrutiny. For Calumet, the path to redemption lies in its renewable execution; for Lucky Strike, it lies in proving that its ""location-based"" empire can be as profitable as it is popular. Investors should remain vigilant, monitoring debt levels and interest coverage ratios as the primary indicators of health for these specialty plays in the coming months.

The upgrade applies to one of four daily services and will be operated by the Airbus A350 Long Haul, improving comfort and consistency for passengers connecting on ultra-long-haul itineraries.

Singapore Airlines A350 Brisbane Flights

From 1 November 2026, Singapore Airlines will upgrade the SQ265/266 rotation between Singapore (SIN) and Brisbane (BNE) from the Airbus A350 Medium Haul to the Airbus A350 Long Haul configuration.

Advertisement

This aircraft features the airline’s 2013 long-haul Business Class seats and a dedicated Premium Economy cabin.

According to Mainly Miles, this marks the first time since October 2022 that Brisbane will again receive Singapore Airlines’ long-haul cabin products, which were a regular feature on at least one daily service prior to the pandemic.

While overall seat capacity on the route will fall by approximately four percent, Business Class capacity will increase.

The A350 Long Haul’s premium-heavy layout adds 14 additional Business Class seats per week in each direction compared to the Medium Haul configuration.

Aircraft Assignment and Operational Shift

The change represents a clear operational shift. In both 2022 and pre-pandemic operations, the 3-class Airbus A350 Long Haul aircraft was assigned to the SQ245/246 service. From November 2026, this designation moves to SQ265/266.

The SQ265/266 rotation is notable as it was the final Brisbane frequency to be restored to daily service following the pandemic. The flight was upgraded from four weekly services to daily operation in mid-June 2025.

Brisbane’s Long-Haul Cabin History

In 2018, Singapore Airlines operated all four daily Brisbane services with long-haul Business Class seating, using either the 2013 Business Class product or the now-retired 2006 configuration.

These seats were progressively replaced by the Regional Business Class product from 2018 onward.

Although technically newer, the regional seat is narrower and is widely regarded by passengers as less comfortable than the older long-haul design. The return of the A350 Long Haul therefore, represents a qualitative improvement rather than a simple fleet substitution.

Daily Schedule from 1 November 2026

Singapore Airlines will operate four daily flights in each direction between Singapore and Brisbane. All services operate every day.

Singapore to Brisbane

Brisbane to Singapore

This structure provides a daytime service from Singapore to Brisbane with an evening return, supporting both local demand and onward connectivity.

Connectivity for Ultra-Long-Haul Passengers

The timing of SQ265 and SQ266 is optimized for long-haul connections via Singapore.

Inbound connections to SQ265 include arrivals from London Gatwick, London Heathrow, Paris, Amsterdam, Zurich, Rome, Johannesburg, and Cape Town, alongside selected services from India and China.

Outbound connections from SQ266 include London Heathrow, Zurich, Rome, Manchester, Johannesburg, Cape Town, and multiple destinations across India and North Asia.

Many passengers on these itineraries undertake journeys exceeding 22 hours. The availability of long-haul Business Class and Premium Economy on the Brisbane sector eliminates the current downgrade in comfort experienced by connecting passengers.

Strategic Importance

Singapore is Brisbane Airport’s second-busiest international route after Auckland. In 2024, Brisbane Airport CEO Gert-Jan de Graaff stated that more than half of all visitors from India to Brisbane traveled via Singapore Airlines.

Indian nationals were the largest group of non-Australian passport holders arriving in Brisbane on Singapore Airlines flights in 2024, followed by Singaporean and British travelers. This highlights the airline’s critical role in Queensland’s inbound tourism market.

KrisFlyer Award Redemption Rates

Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer members can redeem miles for one-way flights between Singapore and Brisbane at the following rates per person:

Taxes and fees apply in addition to mileage and typically total around S$102 from Singapore to Brisbane and S$97 in the return direction.

These amounts are higher than many other routes due to Australia’s international arrival and departure taxes.

Redemptions made on or after 1 April 2026, for travel on or after 1 October 2026, will also incur Singapore’s new Sustainable Aviation Fuel levy on this route.

New Closed-Door Business Class Suites

Singapore Airlines plans to introduce its new closed-door Business Class suites on the Airbus A350 Long Haul from the second quarter of 2026.

The airline aims to complete the full fleet retrofit by late 2030, although similar programs have historically taken longer than initially projected.

While Brisbane may not be among the first destinations to receive the new seats, continued A350 Long Haul deployment positions the route alongside Sydney and Melbourne, both of which already see flights operated by this aircraft type.

Bottom Line

Singapore Airlines’ decision to restore long-haul cabin products on the Singapore–Brisbane route from November 2026 strengthens the route’s appeal for premium and long-haul travelers.

The upgrade of SQ265/266 to the Airbus A350 Long Haul reintroduces Premium Economy and increases Business Class capacity.

For passengers connecting between Australia, Europe, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent, the change delivers consistent comfort across the entire journey.

Compared with 2018, when all four daily flights featured long-haul seating, this represents a measured but meaningful step toward rebuilding Brisbane’s long-haul product offering.

Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of US$1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of the Company’s American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) for the 30 consecutive business days from November 7, 2025 to December 19, 2025, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement.

The Notification Letter does not impact the Company’s listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market at this time. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided 180 calendar days, or until June 22, 2026, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the Company’s ADSs must have a closing bid price of at least US$1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by June 22, 2026, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance or may face delisting.

The Company’s business operations are not affected by the receipt of the Notification Letter. The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its ADSs and may, if appropriate, consider implementing available options, including, but not limited to, implementing a reverse share split of its outstanding ADSs, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under the Nasdaq Listing Rules.

KISSIMMEE, Fla., Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ECD Automotive Design, Inc. (“ECD” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ECDA), the world’s largest Land Rover and Jaguar restoration company known for its custom luxury builds, including bespoke Defenders, Range Rovers, Jaguar E-Types, Ford Mustangs and Toyota FJs, announced that it will implement a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock (“Reverse Stock Split”), effective at market opening time on December 26, 2025. ECD common stock will remain on the Nasdaq Capital Market and begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the markets open on December 26, 2025, under the Company’s existing trading symbol “ECDA,” with the new CUSIP number 27877D302.

The Reverse Stock Split was previously approved by stockholders at the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders held on July 22, 2025, with the final ratio determined by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Reverse Stock Split is intended to increase the per share trading price of ECD’s common stock to satisfy the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market (Rule 550(a)(1)).

As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every five pre-split shares of common stock outstanding will automatically be reclassified and combined into one share of common stock. This will reduce the number of outstanding shares of ECD’s common stock from approximately 6,925,006 shares to approximately 1,385,002 shares. The Reverse Stock Split will not change the number of authorized shares of the company’s common stock or the par value of the common stock. Proportional adjustments will be made to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the company’s outstanding stock options and restricted stock units, as well as the applicable exercise price of the stock options.

Shareholders holding their shares electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive the post-split shares. Shareholders who hold certificated shares will receive instructions from Continental Stock Transfer and Trust, the Company’s transfer agent who is acting as the exchange agent for the Reverse Stock Split. No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share will instead have their fractional share rounded up to the nearest whole share.

Additional information regarding the Reverse Stock Split can be found in the Proxy Statement filed with the SEC.

SKOKIE, Ill., Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) (“LanzaTech” or the “Company”), a leader in carbon transformation technology, today announced an increase in its holdings of LanzaJet, Inc. (“LanzaJet”), a leading sustainable aviation fuel technology provider and fuels producer, to 53%. This announcement follows the successful commissioning and production of ASTM-certified sustainable fuels including Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) and Renewable Diesel (RD) at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia, the world’s first commercial-scale plant to produce jet fuel from ethanol.

On December 16, 2025, LanzaTech received its final tranches of LanzaJet common stock, which brings the Company’s ownership percentage and non-controlling interest in LanzaJet to 53%. These issuances of common stock were made pursuant to the Second Amended & Restated LanzaJet Investment Agreement and represent the final equity tranches under that agreement. The shares were issued in accordance with pre-agreed terms and do not reflect any new capital investment by LanzaTech.

This ownership increase is in accordance with a previously signed agreement which allowed LanzaJet to further sublicense the Alcohol-to-Jet (“ATJ”) technology in exchange for additional equity issued to LanzaTech.

LanzaTech’s platform, originally developed in collaboration with the Pacific Northwest National Lab and the U.S. Department of Energy, enables the production of ethanol from a variety of carbon sources, including agricultural residues, which LanzaJet can use to produce sustainable aviation fuel, or “SAF”, using its industry-leading Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology. By utilizing a diverse array of domestic and waste feedstocks, including those from the agricultural sector, this approach has the potential to both reduce aviation emissions by up to 85% and strengthen supply chain resilience and energy security. Through distributed production and flexible sourcing, LanzaTech and LanzaJet are striving to open new economic opportunities for rural communities and fortify the reliability and sustainability of fuel supply chains.

LanzaTech’s strategic decision to spin out LanzaJet in 2020 was driven by a vision to accelerate the development and deployment of ethanol-to-jet solutions. Today, with a 53% ownership stake, LanzaTech is reinforcing its commitment to LanzaJet’s success and to scaling this vital technology worldwide.

“LanzaTech’s increased stake in LanzaJet comes at an important time for the sustainable fuels sector,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech and Chair of LanzaJet. “The success of LanzaJet’s Freedom Pine’s facility shows that ethanol from diverse domestic and recycled feedstocks—such as waste gases, municipal solid waste, captured CO₂ with hydrogen, and agricultural residues—can be converted into sustainable aviation fuel. We believe that this innovation not only expands supply options but also establishes ethanol as a vital connector between distributed carbon sources and global aviation markets.”

The sustainable aviation fuel industry remains capital-intensive and subject to evolving regulatory and market dynamics. LanzaJet, like many in the sector, is managing operational and financial pressures as it scales. LanzaTech’s increased equity interest does not imply a change in governance or control.

LanzaTech and LanzaJet continue to collaborate on new projects and licensing opportunities via their CirculAir™ offering, leveraging the strengths of both organizations to work towards delivering new energy solutions and driving lasting impact in the aviation industry.

Accounting Impact of Transaction

The Company’s interest in LanzaJet is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with income (loss) from equity method investments, net, including gain on dilution, recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and equity method investments recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

About LanzaTech

LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) is a carbon management solutions company that transforms industrial emissions, gasified solid waste and carbon dioxide into recycled carbon ethanol via proprietary bio-fermentation technology. Ethanol is a crucial building block in the world – a key feedstock for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), marine fuel and other downstream chemical derivatives. Operating commercially at six assets today, LanzaTech’s technology unlocks value across the supply chain, reducing the carbon footprint of hard-to-abate sectors while shepherding recycled carbon fuels and products to the world, building a circular carbon economy. www.lanzatech.com

EDISON, N.J., Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: EOSE) (""Eos"" or the “Company”) an American energy company and the leading innovator in designing, sourcing, manufacturing, and providing zinc-based battery energy storage systems (BESS) manufactured in the United States, today announced that Russ Stidolph, who has served as non-executive Chair since April 2018 and whose firm, AltEnergy, LLC, has been a lead investor in Eos for the past eleven years, has decided to step down from the Board of Directors, effective December 31, 2025, to focus his efforts, full time, on AltEnergy Acquisition Corp. The Board has appointed Joseph Nigro to succeed Stidolph as non-executive Chair, effective January 1, 2026.

“I am proud to have played an integral role in guiding Eos from an early-stage research and development company into a scaled leader of stationary energy storage. When AltEnergy first invested in Eos, the Company built prototype battery cells that to this day cycle twice daily. Watching that product then successfully be piloted in the field, establishing a U.S. manufacturing strategy, building a robust pipeline and backlog and successfully deploying over 5 GWh of operations in the field are accomplishments I will always be proud of,” stated Stidolph. “Bringing Joe Nigro onto the Board earlier this year, with his more than three decades of global energy, utility, and infrastructure experience, positioned Eos for a seamless leadership transition to its next phase of operations and growth.”

Stidolph played a foundational role in Eos’ evolution from its early commercialization efforts to its NASDAQ listing and growth into a scaled American manufacturer. Stidolph has been one of Eos’ earliest and most enduring champions – first as an investor more than a decade ago and later as a Director and Chair.

“Without Russ’ leadership, there would be no Eos,” said Joe Mastrangelo, Eos Chief Executive Officer. “From bringing the required capital along with always recognizing the long-term potential of Eos to recruiting me to the Company, Russ has been instrumental in getting us to where we stand today and we are grateful for his leadership and the many contributions he has made to Eos’ evolution.”

“Russ leaves Eos with a strong foundation for the future,” said Nigro. “His leadership and continued investment allowed Eos to innovate, commercialize, and build one of the most advanced long-duration storage manufacturing platforms in the country. We are grateful for his steady leadership, partnership, and the many contributions he has made to Eos’ development.”

Nigro has held numerous senior leadership roles across the energy industry, including Chief Financial Officer of Exelon Corporation, CEO of Constellation, a former Exelon operating company, and multiple strategic and operational roles across power and gas. Since joining the Eos Board in early 2025, Nigro has play a critical role in shaping the Company’s strategic direction during a period of rapid commercial momentum and U.S. manufacturing expansion.

“Joe’s deep expertise across energy markets, finance, and large-scale operational execution makes him the right leader to guide our Board at this pivotal stage,” said Mastrangelo. “As Eos continues to scale production and meet growing demand for flexible, American-made long-duration storage, Joe’s strategic vision and industry perspective will provide invaluable guidance to our leadership team and shareholders.”

“Eos is building one of the most important energy-infrastructure platforms and is positioned to play a critical role in the future energy mix. As power demand accelerates with AI and electrification, long-duration storage will be essential to strengthen the grid and complement existing generation,” said Nigro. “Eos’ technology is uniquely suited to deliver that flexibility and reliability, and I look forward to partnering closely with Joe, the executive team, and my fellow directors as we support the Company’s next chapter of operational execution and market expansion.”

Proposed acquisition will add direct mortgage lending capabilities to complement the Company’s existing mortgage brokerage operations

Expected to close in the first half of 2026 following regulatory approval

DUBLIN, Ohio, Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- reAlpha Tech Corp. (Nasdaq: AIRE) (the “Company” or “reAlpha”), an AI-powered real estate technology company, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire InstaMortgage Inc. (“InstaMortgage”), an independent mortgage lender.

reAlpha currently operates a mortgage brokerage. The proposed acquisition is intended to complement reAlpha’s existing mortgage brokerage operations by adding direct mortgage lending capabilities and extending reAlpha’s footprint into additional key markets, and enabling greater alignment between brokerage and lending workflows to support a more coordinated borrower experience across the mortgage process.

Founded in 2008 and headquartered in San Jose, California, InstaMortgage is an originations-focused mortgage lender specializing in purchase and refinance loans. Through its technology-enabled platform and experienced lending team, InstaMortgage has helped more than 3,500 borrowers secure residential mortgage financing across 32 states, including New York, New Jersey, Illinois, and Ohio, which would be new markets for reAlpha. InstaMortgage has reported more than $4 billion over the past five years and has received multiple recognitions, being named by the Financial Times as one of America's Fastest-Growing Companies, and being included on Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500 and Inc.’s Inc. 500 list of fastest-growing private companies.

“This agreement is about building the operating system for modern homebuying,” said Mike Logozzo, Chief Executive Officer of reAlpha. “Buyers don’t experience brokerage, lending, and closing as separate categories. They experience one process where clarity and execution matter. Following the completion of the acquisition, InstaMortgage will bring direct lending infrastructure and multi-state licensing that fits our platform strategy. When combined with our existing mortgage brokerage, it will position us to further reduce friction across handoffs and deliver a more coordinated experience, while operating with the discipline this industry demands.”

“Once completed, this transaction will materially expand our mortgage business capabilities,"" said Jamie Cavanaugh, Chief Executive Officer of reAlpha Mortgage. “A direct lender platform will give us another execution path alongside brokerage and support tighter workflow alignment from intake through closing.”

Shashank Shekhar, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of InstaMortgage, said, “We built InstaMortgage with a clear focus: deliver a modern origination experience powered by strong operators and a digital-first process. reAlpha’s vision for an integrated AI-powered homebuying platform aligns with how we see the market evolving, and we’re excited about what this could mean for borrowers, loan officers, and partners as we work toward closing.”

Under the terms of the definitive agreement, reAlpha would acquire 100% of the outstanding equity of InstaMortgage for total consideration of approximately $8.5 million, payable in a combination of cash and reAlpha common stock, including deferred consideration, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement.

The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. reAlpha expects to fund the cash portion of the consideration from cash on hand at the appropriate time, subject to closing. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026 following the receipt of required regulatory approvals.

For additional details regarding the terms of the agreement, please refer to the Company’s Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 2025.

LanzaTech Global ( (LNZA) ) has shared an announcement.

On December 22, 2025, LanzaTech Global announced that its ownership in sustainable aviation fuel specialist LanzaJet, Inc. had risen to 53% from about 36%, after receiving final tranches of LanzaJet common stock on December 16, 2025 under a pre‑existing investment agreement that required no new capital outlay and leaves governance and control unchanged. The move follows the successful commissioning and production of ASTM‑certified sustainable fuels, including SPK and renewable diesel, at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Georgia—the first commercial‑scale plant to make jet fuel from ethanol—and underscores LanzaTech’s strategic focus on scaling ethanol‑to‑jet technology, leveraging diverse waste‑ and agriculture‑based feedstocks to cut aviation emissions, bolster energy security and rural economies, while LanzaJet continues to face the capital‑intensive, regulation‑sensitive realities of the sustainable aviation fuel market and remains accounted for as an equity‑method, non‑controlling investment.

The most recent analyst rating on (LNZA) stock is a Sell with a $14.50 price target. To see the full list of analyst forecasts on LanzaTech Global stock, see the LNZA Stock Forecast page.

Spark’s Take on LNZA Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, LNZA is a Underperform.

LanzaTech Global’s overall stock score is primarily impacted by its poor financial performance, characterized by declining revenues, high leverage, and negative cash flows. The technical analysis indicates a bearish trend, further weighing down the score. Valuation metrics are unfavorable, with a negative P/E ratio and no dividend yield. While there are positive corporate developments, they are not sufficient to offset the significant financial and technical challenges.

LanzaTech’s strategic decision to spin out LanzaJet in 2020 was driven by a vision to accelerate the development and deployment of ethanol-to-jet solutions. Today, with a 53% ownership stake, LanzaTech is reinforcing its commitment to LanzaJet’s success and to scaling this vital technology worldwide.

“LanzaTech’s increased stake in LanzaJet comes at an important time for the sustainable fuels sector,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech and Chair of LanzaJet. “The success of LanzaJet’s Freedom Pine’s facility shows that ethanol from diverse domestic and recycled feedstocks—such as waste gases, municipal solid waste, captured CO₂ with hydrogen, and agricultural residues—can be converted into sustainable aviation fuel. We believe that this innovation not only expands supply options but also establishes ethanol as a vital connector between distributed carbon sources and global aviation markets.”

This year marked the point where hydrogen transportation stopped being a future tense conversation and became an accounting exercise. Across light duty vehicles, buses, trucks, trains, mining equipment, refueling infrastructure, and even aviation, withdrawals outpaced commitments. These were not isolated pilots failing at the margins. They were coordinated retreats spread across continents, business models, and political systems. Most were announced quietly through strategy updates, end of week disclosures, or year end statements framed as focus or discipline. Taken together, they form a coherent pattern of abandonment driven by operational reality rather than ideology.

In light duty transportation, hydrogen failed completely as demand collapsed. The French hydrogen taxi firm Hype ended hydrogen operations entirely and moved to battery electric vehicles. Global fuel cell car sales fell to near zero outside South Korea. South Korea remained an outlier only because vehicles were subsidized at roughly 50% to 60% and hydrogen fuel received direct support. Hydrogen refueling stations closed across Europe, North America, and Asia. California stations experienced outages, rationing, and closures that undermined now almost non-existent consumer trust. Automakers stopped marketing fuel cell cars in most markets without issuing formal exit statements. The absence of new city or fleet commitments was more telling than any individual cancellation.

Heavy trucks were supposed to be hydrogen’s strongest case. Long distances, high payloads, and centralized depots were repeatedly cited as advantages. Reality moved in the opposite direction. Fuel cell heavy truck sales declined globally while battery electric heavy truck deployments surged, especially in China. Chinese fleets adopted battery electric trucks at scale for port drayage, construction haulage, and regional freight. Meanwhile, major manufacturers including Stellantis, GM, Daimler, Honda, and MAN withdrew from hydrogen truck programs, sometimes with a face-saving statement about deferring them. Startups built around hydrogen trucking collapsed. Hyzon, Nikola, and Quantron entered bankruptcy along with a long tail of suppliers and integrators. Cummins initiated a strategic assessment of its hydrogen business, a signal that further contraction is likely. Bosch reduced emphasis on hydrogen mobility while shifting investment toward electrification. No hydrogen truck platform reached sustained serial production. At the same time, battery electric trucks demonstrated daily freight operations with predictable costs and maintenance regimes. Fleets chose vehicles that arrived, worked, and stayed in service.

Public transit exposed hydrogen’s operating cost problem more clearly than any other segment. Cities learned that capital grants did not solve fuel and maintenance risk. Dijon abandoned hydrogen bus acquisitions after committing real capital and infrastructure. Van Hool, heavily exposed to hydrogen buses, went bankrupt. McPhy, a supplier of hydrogen fueling and electrolysis systems tied to bus deployments, collapsed, leaving stranded assets. In Poland, 26 cities that had bought or were buying hydrogen buses appealed to the national government for emergency fuel subsidies after discovering that hydrogen prices were far higher than expected. Similar dynamics played out across Europe and North America as transit agencies paused or canceled hydrogen procurements. Canada improved its zero emission transit fund, and in the process eliminated the sole-source advisory role for a think tank that kept inserting hydrogen into fleet plans through modeling tricks and bad data. Battery electric buses delivered predictable energy costs, simpler maintenance, and higher availability. Transit agencies reverted to technologies that fit their budgets and workforce skills.

Rail was another sector where hydrogen was framed as unavoidable. The claim was that lightly used or rural lines could not justify electrification. In practice, hydrogen trains added complexity without solving infrastructure constraints. Lower Saxony reduced its hydrogen train operations with only a fraction of the original fleet remaining active and dropped plans to acquire more. Alstom dropped hydrogen trains from its product focus after years of promotion. In the United Kingdom, hydrogen traction quietly disappeared from rail planning. India hit 99.2% heavy rail electrification with overhead wires. Switzerland and Austria reaffirmed electrification strategies and battery assisted solutions for non electrified segments. Rail operators favored overhead wires, partial electrification, and batteries because they reduced operating risk and fit existing maintenance models. Hydrogen trains failed to demonstrate reliability or cost advantages at scale.

The same pattern played out on water. Hydrogen ferries and marine vessels have delivered a small number of demonstration projects over the past few years that featured higher capital costs, higher operating costs, and in many cases higher lifecycle emissions once upstream hydrogen production was included. Hydrogen storage displaced payload and passenger space, bunkering infrastructure failed to appear at scale, and utilization rates remained low. Hydrogen marine projects depended on subsidies and novelty rather than economics and did not progress beyond pilots. In contrast, battery electric vessels moved rapidly from demonstration to deployment. Electric ferries scaled across Norway, Europe, China, and North America on fixed routes with high utilization, supported by declining battery costs and straightforward shore power infrastructure. Orders for 2,100 passenger pure electric ferries were booked. Battery electric container ships also entered service in Europe and China on short sea and inland routes, with ports installing megawatt scale charging and containerized battery swapping to support high frequency operations. Installed battery capacity in marine vessels increased year over year, while hydrogen activity remained flat or declined as projects were canceled or quietly reframed as research. In marine transport, as on land, hydrogen delivered higher costs and worse emissions profiles without market growth, while battery electric systems expanded because they worked.

Off road and industrial mobility removed one of hydrogen’s last rhetorical defenses. Mining, construction, and port equipment were often cited as sectors where batteries would struggle. Fortescue formally abandoned hydrogen plans and ordered billions of dollars of battery electric mining trucks and equipment. Construction equipment manufacturers advanced electrified platforms without hydrogen pilots. Ports electrified yard tractors, cranes, material handling equipment and tugs rather than pursuing hydrogen. Even in remote and heavy duty applications, electricity proved easier to manage than compressed hydrogen. Maintenance, energy delivery, and system efficiency favored electrification.

Refueling infrastructure collapsed in parallel with vehicle demand. Shell exited the hydrogen refueling station business entirely. BP closed its hydrogen fuels division. Stations shut down across Europe, North America, and China. Japan saw declining utilization rates despite long standing national support. No private capital stepped in to replace oil major investment. Hydrogen stations had no secondary economic use and could not be repurposed easily. Infrastructure built ahead of demand remained idle while operating costs accumulated. Without vehicles, stations closed. Without stations, vehicles had no reason to exist.

Corporate balance sheets confirmed what deployments already showed. Fuel cell manufacturers focused on transportation bled cash at accelerating rates. Ballard Power, Plug Power, and FuelCell Energy reported ongoing losses, shrinking backlogs, and geographic retrenchment. Firms like Lhyfe continued their fiscal delivery of massive losses and declining cash reserves, along with rhetorical claims of success, while the reality is staff layoffs, cost cutting, and geographical and segment retrenchment. Reverse stock splits were used to maintain listings as share prices fell. Venture capital avoided hydrogen transportation startups. Project finance dried up even where government guarantees existed. Revenues increasingly came from non transportation segments or one off contracts. Public markets reflected operational reality rather than long term narratives.

Aviation marked the final symbolic retreat. Airbus shelved its hydrogen aviation programs after years of promotional work. Hydrogen aviation startup ZeroAvia continues to burn cash without delivering any certified aircraft, missing its 2025 target and laying off needed staff on both sides of the Atlantic this year. Hydrogen aircraft were always speculative to the point of being science fiction, dependent on breakthroughs in storage, weight, and infrastructure. As costs and timelines became clearer, even symbolic long term bets were abandoned. Aviation attention returned to efficiency improvements and sustainable aviation fuel pathways that align with existing aircraft and infrastructure, as well as hybrid and fully electric aircraft.

None of this should have been surprising. Hydrogen transportation suffers from efficiency losses at every conversion step. Electricity must be generated, converted to hydrogen, compressed or liquefied, transported, stored, and converted back to electricity or mechanical energy. Each step adds cost, complexity, and energy loss. Capital requirements are high and operating costs volatile. Fuel delivery involves specialized equipment, safety constraints, and leakage risk. Institutions rewarded announcements and pilot projects rather than delivered outcomes. Subsidy uptake was treated as validation rather than a warning sign. Sunk cost bias, prestige projects, and salience effects kept programs alive longer than performance justified.

Hydrogen remains a necessary industrial feedstock that has to be decarbonized, a climate change problem on the scale of all of aviation. It does not function as a general purpose transportation energy carrier. The past year tested the proposition across every major vehicle class, geography, and subsidy regime. The results were consistent. This was not corruption or incompetence. It was systems reality asserting itself.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_j7276hj7276hj727-800x442.png,N,,2025-12-22 17:57:18.862395

This would not have been possible without a shared vision for our islands and our great teamwork,” said Eric Wright, president of Par Hawaii.
“We are thrilled to be the first customer to receive SAF from Par Hawaii next year,” added James.","Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines on Dec. 17 announced it has joined Par Hawaii to invest in pioneering the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Hawaiʻi using locally grown agriculture feedstock to reduce aviation carbon emissions.

This initiative will enable SAF production for more sustainable future flying and deliver economic benefits through the creation of a new energy sector and fuel supply chain in Hawai’i, while bringing new opportunities for local agriculture.

Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines, which together provide the most flights to, from and within Hawai‘i, and Par Hawaii, the largest producer of energy products in the islands, are partnering with Pono Pacific, through its Pono Energy, Inc. subsidiary, to study Camelina sativa (camelina) as a multi-purpose crop that can be used as SAF feedstock and to support agriculture.

The combined airlines also will become Par Hawaii’s launch SAF customer, with plans to take delivery of Hawaiʻi’s first locally produced SAF in the first quarter of 2026.

SAF, a safe drop-in fuel made from sustainable feedstock such as plant-based oils or used cooking oil, can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. Pono Pacific’s crop trials drew the attention of Alaska Star Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alaska Air Group that invests in technologies to drive aviation efficiency, performance and innovation.

“As Hawaiʻi’s airline, we have a responsibility to reduce our environmental impact while continuing to provide essential air service that connects our communities and strengthens our economy. Our company has a long-term strategy to reach net zero carbon emissions, and sustainable aviation fuel is essential for us to get there. We are grateful to have partners like Par Hawaii and Pono Pacific who share our commitment to making our operations more sustainable while creating a new fuel industry and strengthening Hawaiʻi’s energy independence,” said Alanna James, sustainability innovation director at Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines.

“We value the efforts of our airline partners as we work together to find long-term solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase our energy security, while meeting Hawai‘i’s transportation needs. We applaud Hawaiian and Alaska airlines, Par Hawaii, and Pono Pacific for taking this important step to establish a locally based, lower-emissions supply chain for aviation fuel that supports our state’s clean energy goals,” said Ed Sniffen, director, Hawai‘i State Department of Transportation.

Pono Pacific, the state’s largest private resource company, will launch Pono Energy, Inc. in early 2026 to accelerate its work on camelina, a high-yield, pest-resistant cover crop that can be grown in rotation with food crops, reaching maturity in just eight to nine weeks. Its oil seeds can be crushed to produce renewable fuels, including SAF, while the remaining seedcake can be turned into government-approved, nutrient-rich feed for cattle and chickens. This revenue-generating cover crop will deliver more economic opportunity for Hawai‘i by creating jobs, supporting farmers and decreasing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

“Camelina represents a rare opportunity for Hawai‘i to build a true circular-economy model around renewable fuels. By growing this crop locally, we strengthen our agricultural sector, keep more dollars circulating within the state, and reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels. Camelina can be refined into sustainable aviation fuel while the remaining seedcake becomes a valuable, locally produced animal feed that supports Hawai‘i’s ranchers and livestock industry. We will explore food crops that can be grown alongside camelina to increase food security as well. It’s a win for our economy, a win for local agriculture, and a win for the environment — an example of how Hawai‘i can lead the way in innovative, homegrown climate solutions,” said Chris Bennett, vice president of sustainable energy solutions at Pono Pacific Land Management LLC.

Alaska Star Ventures has made a new investment that builds on Par Hawaii’s earlier support of Pono Pacific, which collaborated with the Hawaiʻi Agriculture Research Center to begin cultivating 50 non-GMO camelina varieties in 2023 to identify those best suited to Hawaiʻi’s year-round temperate climate.

The initial investment allowed Pono Pacific to conduct crop trials on four islands, in partnership with Aloun Farms, Mahi Pono and Meadow Gold Dairy. Pono Pacific identified suitable agricultural lands across the state and engaged Hawai‘i’s cattle and livestock industry to explore the use of camelina seedcake as animal feed.

As Pono Pacific advances the agricultural foundation for camelina, Par Hawaii, the state largest fuels manufacturer, is preparing to deliver SAF in the first quarter of 2026. Earlier this year, Par Pacific, parent company of Par Hawaii, formed Hawai‘i Renewables, and partnered with Alohi Renewable Energy, LLC, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Corporation and ENEOS Corporation, following a $100 million investment to convert and upgrade one of the refinery’s processing units into a renewable hydrotreater capable of processing plant-based and waste oils.

“In 2022, when we formed an agreement with Hawaiian Airlines to jointly study the commercial viability of locally produced sustainable aviation fuels, we didn’t think we would be able to progress so quickly. With renewable fuel production coming online in early 2026, it’s exciting to see the results of our team’s hard work. These fuels will have up to 80 percent lower carbon emissions compared to conventional fuels. This would not have been possible without a shared vision for our islands and our great teamwork,” said Eric Wright, president of Par Hawaii.

“We are thrilled to be the first customer to receive SAF from Par Hawaii next year,” added James.

“This is an important milestone for our company and Hawai’i, but there is still more work to do. While SAF is the best option to reduce aviation emissions, it is two to three times more expensive than regular jet fuel and supply is limited. We will need strong collaboration across airlines, fuel and feedstock producers, investors, including business partners seeking to offset their scope 3 emissions, and government, along with supportive policies, to grow the SAF industry and reach our decarbonization goals.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Biomass_updated_Logo_8d3314e0ca.png,N,,2025-12-22 17:57:23.121725

Through the end of the year, The Bedford Citizen will be sharing recaps of some of the major stories in town from 2025. The stories are in no particular order.

Happenings at Hanscom Field in 2025 included potential hangar expansion, the suspension and resumption of ICE flights at the facility and environmental matters.

About a year after a draft environmental impact report (DEIR) for the development of a proposed hangar complex at Hanscom Field was submitted but deemed unsatisfactory by Secretary of Environmental Affairs Rebecca Tepper, community members continued voicing their opposition to the project, with some calling on their elected representatives to step in and stop the expansion due to environmental impact concerns.

In February, Kathy Kerby called the proposed hangar expansion – commonly referred to as the North Airfield development – a “climate bomb in sheep’s clothing,” urging the community to not let the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), who owns Hanscom Field, “pull the wool over our eyes.”

In March, Janet Rothrock of the First Parish in Concord and Sue Swanson of Bedford, a member of Episcopal Creation Care Justice Network in Massachusetts, called on Gov. Maura Healey to stop the project, stating that faith communities throughout the region were concerned that the proposed expansion would “intensify both the climate crisis and environmental injustice impacts.”

That same month, Warren Senders also urged Healey to stop the proposed expansion, calling it “a recipe for inequality and irresponsibility.”

A State House rally was held in April in an effort to publicize and stop the proposed expansion. At the rally, a letter from more than 40 historians, scientists, and climate and environmental advocates was delivered to Healey, urging her to “preserve the area’s endangered historic sites and protect the climate by halting the proposed private jet hangar expansion at Hanscom [Field].”

That same month, Lori Etringer of the Bedford chapter of Mothers Out Front thanked state Sen. Michael Barrett for sentiments he shared at the rally. Etringer said Barrett described the proposed expansion as “the worst conjoining of wealth disparity and climate destructiveness.”

In May, climate activist Brian Okum was acquitted in Concord District Court on charges of felony malicious destruction of property more than $1,200 and disorderly conduct in relation to an April 2024 protest of the proposed expansion at Hanscom Field. Okum was convicted on a trespassing count and sentenced to one year of probation.

The advocacy group Extinction Rebellion organized the protest, and police arrested Okum and 20 others after they allegedly breached a secure area at the airport. Roughly 50 police officers responded, according to court testimony, and the incident disrupted activity at Hanscom Field for roughly 3 1/2 hours.

Navy Hangar Activity

Potential use of the Navy hangar space on Hartwell Road became a topic of interest for research and development and medical services companies.

Autonomous aviation startup Merlin Labs showed interest in May in setting up a research and development facility at the Navy hangar site, which was included in the North Airfield development. The idea was to initially set up a facility with a few dozen positions, the majority of which would be engineers and pilots running testing.

Future plans possibly included moving the headquarters, along with more than 100 new and existing jobs, from Boston to Bedford.

Runway Realty Ventures LLC previously purchased the space with the intention of incorporating the Navy hangar into a substantial infrastructure project. The project intent was to add aviation support – aircraft storage hangar and administration space – to the area close to Hartwell Road, by renovating the Navy hangar and also adding approximately 450,000 square feet of hangar space across 17 new construction buildings.

Negotiations between Merlin Labs and Runway Realty Ventures LLC and North Airfield Ventures LLC included plans for the company to lease 75% to 80% of the Navy hangar space – which had been vacant for around 25 years – in a long-term lease. The proponents would fund renovation of the hangar space, formerly used for research and development by Raytheon and the Navy operations.

In June, North Airfield Ventures LLC and Runway Realty Ventures LLC submitted a Notice of Project Change (NPC) with a phase one waiver request to remove the existing Navy hangar building and some surrounding property from the larger North Airfield expansion project proposal into its own separate project.

In addition to the hangar being renovated for research and development purposes, the proposal called for updating an existing ramp to access the Hanscom Field runway and creating an access to Hartwell Road, as well as creating a surface parking lot with 140 spaces.

North Airfield Ventures LLC and Runway Realty Ventures LLC held a public information session that same month to provide an overview and answer questions about the Navy hangar project.

The information session included a presentation of the project by Rick Muse, North Airfield Ventures director of operations, and an overview of the contents and technical studies in the NPC by Lauren DeVoe, environmental review consultant with VHB.

Additionally, the project team claimed one to two Merlin test flights per day with at least one human operator on board, with some additional flights from other potential Navy hangar tenants. Experimental flights were proposed to take place in uncongested areas like the New Hampshire coastline, as well as some takeoffs and landings.

A handful of people commented and asked questions, with a few raising concerns over adding any amount of greenhouse gasses as the state, Bedford, and other neighboring towns work toward Net Zero. The team said that plans for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Hanscom Field are in the near future (including in the larger project plan), and the use of clean or electric aircraft is not out of the question, but availability of that technology is not here yet.

In July, members of the Hanscom Field Advisory Commission (HFAC), which represents the residents of the four towns surrounding Hanscom Field, had questions regarding the Navy hangar project and voiced concerns about the safety of experimental autonomous technology over the populated areas neighboring Hanscom Field.

Additionally, some HFAC members were wary about the larger North Airfield development. HFAC members decided to create and submit individual statements of concern ahead of the July 25 NPC comment period deadline, with potential wording including: “We feel that any increase in aviation traffic will harm the communities and should be opposed.”

In September, Merlin Labs officially announced it will establish a new test flight center at Hanscom Field, with operations likely beginning in early 2027. It will occupy hangar, office, and lab space in the former Navy hangar.

According to the company’s announcement, the move to Hanscom Field began the next phase of its ongoing flight test campaign with its Cessna Caravan aircraft, “which is the world’s first and only approved certification basis for AI-enabled, takeoff-to-touchdown onboard autonomy.”

The company also stated that test operations at Hanscom Field support Merlin’s partnership with the U.S. Special Operations Command and the Air Force to integrate the Merlin Pilot on the C-130J and the KC-135 aircraft platforms.

ICE Flights

HFAC Lincoln representative Christopher Eliot was quoted about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) flights out of Hanscom Field in a WBUR story that was released ahead of HFAC’s June meeting. There was some discussion about the reported “dramatic increase” in flights leaving from Hanscom Field to transport detainees to holding facilities in Texas and Louisiana.

When asked to verify or quantify the activities, Amber Goodspeed, manager of airport administration for Hanscom Field, said that “as a general aviation airport, nobody is required permission,” and charter clients and passengers are not registered with Massport.

While commission members had personal opinions, they decided that, like Massport, it was not HFAC business. Margaret Coppe, HFAC chair and Lexington representative, said that while it seemed important to publicly shine a light on the activities going on so close by, from the commission’s purview, there is “no basis for objecting to them using Hanscom [Field].”

In July, ICE stopped using Hanscom Field for local detainee flights. Prior to that announcement, reports said that many Massachusetts ICE detainees had been sent to Hanscom Field from the Plymouth County Jail. Detainees were then reportedly flown from Hanscom Field to larger detention centers around the country.

ICE Boston spokesperson James Covington, quoted in a story by The Concord Bridge, did not know why the move away from Hanscom Field was made, but did believe it was not just a temporary halt.

When the topic of ICE flights was revisited at HFAC’s July meeting, the group consensus had changed somewhat, seeing that it was an issue of concern to the community and that the commission had a right to have its input considered.

ICE resumed its use of Hanscom Field in September. Covington said ICE’s use of the airport had resumed “to support Operation Patriot 2.0. Flying aliens out of Hanscom [Field] allows ICE to move detainees quickly from the intake center at Burlington to a detention center once they have been processed.”

Coppe said HFAC was not notified, instead receiving reports from the community that ICE had resumed flights to Hanscom Field.

“In order to properly carry out our charge, we need to know this information,” she said. “We have a role to perform, and we can’t do it unless we’re properly informed.”

In response to questions and concerns voiced by community members, HFAC asked for more transparency from Massport and ICE in regard to ICE activity at Hanscom Field.

HFAC’s September meeting had what members described as an “unprecedented” number of participants, as nearly 80 people logged onto the Zoom meeting to join in on the commission’s conversation about ICE’s use of Hanscom Field. Participants included community members from Hanscom’s towns, as well as activists from the region and other states, such as Vermont, who were protesting against ICE’s actions.

HFAC sent a letter to Massport CEO Richard Davey, calling on ICE and Massport “to supply information for any and all upcoming ICE flights including date, time, and type of aircraft.” Additionally, the letter requested commentary on the safety and legality of ICE’s activity.

Hanscom Field Director Christopher Willenborg responded on behalf of Davey on Sept. 24. In his response, Willenborg wrote that Hanscom Field is “legally obligated to allow all types of aircraft operations without unjust discrimination, including those sponsored by the federal government.” He also advised HFAC to contact ICE directly, as airport representatives do not receive advance notification of the agency’s flight activity.

However, the assertion that airport representatives do not receive advance notice of ICE activity was disputed in November when The Lexington Observer received an email exchange acquired by a local activist through a public records request. According to the Observer, the source wished to remain anonymous, but The Bedford Citizen independently confirmed the existence of the emails.

In the exchange, Anthony Caruso – a general manager with Hanscom airfield services operations company Signature Aviation – wrote to Willenborg and Keith Leonhardt, Massport airport and operations manager for Hanscom, that Signature had received information about two ICE charter flights at Hanscom.

Rev. Jamie Hinson-Rieger, senior minister at First Parish–Unitarian Universalist, and Rev. John Gibbons, minister emeritus at First Parish, called the Observer’s story and the email exchange “a blockbuster revelation that reveals covert collaboration between ICE, Hanscom Field, and Massport that previously has been denied.”

Due to the significance of the concerns brought to the commission in September, HFAC also wrote a letter to Covington and ICE leadership, outlining the same concerns as written in the commission’s letter to Massport.

On Dec. 12, Healey wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, calling on ICE to stop flying detainees out of Hanscom Field.

Fuel Emissions/Air Quality

In March, HFAC reviewed challenges and potential solutions to reducing the use of leaded aviation gasoline (avgas) at Hanscom Field, as well as the impact of leaded aviation fuel emissions on public health.

Eliot shared that according to his research, low levels of lead exposure can have major health implications. He said that studies at other airports have shown that lead pollution is most concentrated within a one-kilometer (0.62-mile) radius of an airport.

The culmination of months of work, HFAC put together a statement of its “best guess as to what the concern is” surrounding the use of leaded avgas at Hanscom Field.

While “the danger of lead poisoning is so well documented,” said Eliot in the April meeting, the group’s research found some conflicting – some alarming and some reassuring – scientific and anecdotal results in studies concerning lead exposure surrounding airports.

The statement mentioned the Northeast region as a hot spot for lead exposure, and, locally, “Hanscom Field is among the top 50 most lead polluting airports in the country.”

The statement called for “Massport and the [Federal Aviation Administration] to recognize the severity of this problem both nationally and locally and to take all necessary measures to implement a solution at Hanscom Airport with urgent priority.”

A research project regarding air quality impacts in the towns that border Hanscom Field found that there is a high concentration of ultrafine particles (UFP) and airborne lead.

Neelakshi Hudda of Tufts University presented the results of the study in September. The study was requested due to concern that the proposed North Airfield development project will result in a significant increase in greenhouse gas and UFP emissions.

The study showed that the highest concentration of UFPs occurred at sites downwind of the airport during periods of moderate wind and high flight activity. Hudda said the Bedford sampling sites showed higher concentrations of UFPs when the wind was coming from the southwest.

Hudda also noted that airborne lead was detected in 100% of samples taken from the testing sites in the Hanscom communities. Hudda compared her team’s measured lead concentrations – hypothesized to be affected by the combustion of leaded fuel used by aircraft with piston engines – to measurements made at the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Agency data-collection site in Boston and found that concentrations of lead around Hanscom Field are, on average, larger than in the Boston area.

The World Health Organization issued “good practice” statements on UFPs to guide researchers and other decisionmakers toward measures to reduce ambient UFP concentrations. Information about UFPs can be found on pages 149 to 151 of WHO’s global air quality guidelines.

The study found that UFP concentrations exceed World Health Organization (WHO) thresholds at varying levels at each study site under at least one of the testing conditions. While many exceeded the WHO threshold by 4% and below, three of the test sites – the two closest to runways and one along the landing path – exceeded the threshold by an average of 35% and by as much as 79% during a monitoring period.

In October, The Coalition to Stop Private Jet Expansion at Hanscom or Anywhere (SPJE) held a rally at the State House against the potential use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to reduce the spread of greenhouse gases in Massachusetts and to continue the fight against expansion at Hanscom Field.

SAF is a biofuel used to power aircraft that has similar properties to conventional jet fuel, but with a smaller carbon footprint. SAF can be produced from non-petroleum-based renewable feedstocks, including food and yard waste, portions of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, fats, greases, oils, and other feedstocks.

Rally participants argued that SAFs will not be beneficial in reducing lifecycle aviation emissions to near zero by 2050 to contribute to the state’s clean energy and climate plan. Diane Proctor of the Concord-Carlisle League of Women Voters presented a letter to the governor and state legislators, urging them to reject policies and subsidies promoting the production and distribution of SAFs in Massachusetts. The letter was signed by over 50 organizations, six of which are based in Bedford.

Other Activities at Hanscom Field

In April, Massport appointed Willenborg as the new director of Hanscom Field. He succeeded Sharon Williams, who was named director of aviation facilities and passenger services at Boston Logan International Airport.

Willenborg had more than 25 years of leadership experience in the airport industry as an airport manager, state aeronautics director, and airport consultant.

He previously served as the airport manager of Westfield-Barnes Regional Airport in Westfield, where he was responsible for overseeing daily operations, managing the development and execution of annual budgets, and leading strategic initiatives. Over the past four years, this included directing more than $60 million in airside and landside capital improvement projects.

HFAC member and pilot Tom Hirsch provided insight, history, pilot perspective, and technical information about Hanscom Field in June.

About 100 animals from shelters impacted by flooding in Texas made their way to Hanscom Field in July. Two staff members from the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell Animal Medical Center (MSPCA-Angell) were on the ground in Texas to aid in the transport.

MSPCA-Angell staff members prepared about 100 cats and dogs to make the journey from Texas to shelters in the Northeast. Of those 100, approximately 50 animals were taken to a transport space at MSPCA-Angell’s Cape Cod Adoption Center.

Roughly 20 cats and 30 dogs came from the Williamson Animal Shelter, which is located about five miles from the flood zone. Williamson Animal Shelter had been taking in animals to help two other local shelters, Lampasas Animal Shelter and Georgetown Animal Shelter, which did not have access to drinkable water.

The animals that were transported were living in the shelters prior to the floods and were not displaced by them.

In October, Massport, alongside several mutual aid partners, held an emergency response exercise at Hanscom Field. This exercise is mandated by the FAA every three years.

The drill tested the coordination, communication, and response in the event of a major incident at Hanscom Field. Mutual aid partners taking part in the drill alongside Massport Fire Rescue included the Bedford, Lexington, Concord, Lincoln, and Waltham fire and police departments, Massachusetts State Police, the Hanscom Air Force Base Fire Department, Armstrong Ambulance, Action Ambulance, and Boston MedFlight.",https://cdn.thebedfordcitizen.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/phoMOF-at-State-House.jpg,N,,2025-12-22 18:57:00.177695

Proposed by Nova Sustainable Fuels, the project has received environmental approval from the province, according to a report by CBC News. The company, backed by European energy giant Octopus Energy, plans to build a $4-6 billion facility to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable ethanol, using solar and wind power and biomass. The company describes the products as ""two critical low-carbon fuels for decarbonizing the transportation sector.""

The project would proceed in two phases. The first phase is building a production facility near the mouth of Isaacs Harbour, NS. In the second phase, wind and solar farms would be built to connect to the plant. That would require another environmental assessment, which the company said it plans to submit in 2027.

The jet fuel plant would require 60 truckloads of biomass (wood waste) per day and 586 cubic meters of fresh water per hour, which would be pulled from two nearby lakes.

Nova Sustainable Fuels expects it will take two to three years to construct and have a 50-year lifespan. Nova Scotia's environment minister, Tim Halman, has put a few conditions on the project, including that it must be built within two years.

Nova Scotia has recently turned toward traditional oil and gas sources, despite strategizing a shift from fossil fuels to renewables focused on wind power. In July the province announced it is returning to offshore petroleum exploration for the first time since 2018, offering 13 new parcels covering 3.3 million hectares near the Scotian Shelf. Energy Minister Trevor Boudreau said offshore natural gas presents a ""major economic opportunity.""

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, made from sustainable sources such as biofuels, biomass, and captured carbon from oil and gas operations. It is said to cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% and can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure without modifications.
