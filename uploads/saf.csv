China's infamous ""gutter oil"" – waste cooking oil once illegally recycled from sewers and restaurant drains – has transformed from a food safety scandal into a valuable commodity for aviation decarbonization. Prices have quadrupled in two years due to surging global demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Waste oil serves as the primary feedstock for HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids), currently the most commercially mature SAF production method. Chinese companies now have over one million tonnes of annual SAF production capacity, with new facilities like Honeywell's plant converting 500,000 tonnes of waste oil into fuel yearly.

This demand surge stems from aggressive international policies, particularly the EU's mandates requiring 2% SAF use by 2025 and 70% by 2050. SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, though it costs two to five times more – potentially adding $3.6 billion to global airline costs in 2025.

China has no mandatory blending requirements but aims to consume 50,000 tonnes of SAF between 2021-2025. The transformation represents a remarkable shift: what was once a dangerous contaminant in the food supply chain has become a scarce resource in the global energy transition.

Critics warn that bio-based SAF cannot scale fast enough to replace fossil jet fuel and may create competing pressures on food supplies and natural carbon sinks.",,N,,2025-12-29 15:56:44.475655

We cannot simply offshore our carbon responsibilities, with workers again paying the price.
A seismic shift in defence spending should be delivering increased jobs and living standards for workers in Britain.
So why are defence workers still waiting for government orders to match the rhetoric?","It cannot just be a question of changing the leader or improving the sales pitch. There is much agonising right now about whether, when and who should replace the prime minister. That is inevitable. But a new Labour leader with the same policies won’t cut it. Replacing Keir with Angela, Andy, Wes or Ed won’t persuade workers to return to the fold if they are just offering more of the same in a different voice.

I have been criticised for holding this Labour government to account. Unite was the only affiliated union that did not endorse the manifesto, as it did not back jobs. We fought back on the winter fuel allowance cut and the self-harm of net zero targets that came without the needed investment in new industries. Trade unions are there to fight for workers not to side with politicians.

The government’s opening promises of “tough times” has certainly been delivered. When I was on picket lines in 2025 more and more Unite workers were asking: “When it comes to balancing the books, why are workers and communities paying the price again?” In the recent budget, Labour opting for stealth taxes on workers instead of a wealth tax on the mega-rich was the wrong choice.

Labour must stop being embarrassed to be the voice of workers. If Labour is to be Labour, we need to call things by their real name. Since winter 2021 energy prices have increased by 42 per cent. Big energy has a licence to print money while pensioners live in fear of the electricity bill. Unite research shows in 2024, the UK’s energy companies made £30 billion in profits. Currently £500 of the average household energy bill goes straight to energy companies’ profits.

As a union leader, my energy is directed to defend workers. Often, we are the last defence. In 2025 thousands of Unite members were prepared to take industrial action and put hundreds of millions into their pay as a result.

• Inside the fight to save icon of northeast from ‘catastrophe’

Workers are fed up with carrying the can. Take the UK’s parlous performance on productivity. It’s not workers who should be blamed ― our productivity failures reflect an investment strike in UK plc. A collective failure to invest in industry, while maximising returns for shareholders.

Britain is near the bottom of the OECD class in industrial investment and it wasn’t workers who put us there. In 2026 Labour must deliver real growth, borrow to invest in Britain to create a sustainable future.

That includes net zero. Workers see Labour’s current policies as a jobless transition. No one is against net zero, but we cannot let go of one rope before we have hold of another. We cannot simply offshore our carbon responsibilities, with workers again paying the price.

The UK desperately needs Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The Grangemouth refinery could have produced it. Instead, the refinery was allowed to close and we are set to import SAF from the US and China. What an act of self-harm.

A seismic shift in defence spending should be delivering increased jobs and living standards for workers in Britain.

With all the challenges facing private companies this year, they must leverage every available tax benefit.

Fortunately, lawmakers have packed the federal tax code with credits and incentives to reward taxpayers for specific activities and investments.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act made significant revisions to energy credits, imposing new restrictions and phasing out many of the credits early.

Despite the changes, there is still considerable runway for many projects, and both the tax equity financing and credit transfer markets should remain robust over the next several years.

In addition, the OBBBA enhanced existing incentives, offering new opportunities for tax-efficient structuring.

Energy Provisions

The OBBBA has reshaped the energy credit landscape. Several credits were extended or enhanced, while many others are subject to new sourcing and investment requirements or are phasing out early.

The legislation does not affect the ability to transfer or claim refundable payments for specified credits.

Consumer Credits: The OBBBA repeals several energy-related tax credits directed to consumers, each with distinct effective dates:

Section 25E—Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 30D—Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 45W—Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 30C—Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit: Repealed for property placed in service after June 30, 2026.

Section 25C—Energy-Efficient Home Improvement Credit: Repealed for property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2025.

Section 25D—Residential Clean Energy Credit: Repealed for expenditures made after Dec. 31, 2025.

Section 45L—New Energy-Efficient Home Credit: Repealed for property acquired after June 30, 2026.

Depreciation: The bill eliminates the five-year depreciable life for qualified energy property, and the Section 179D deduction is repealed for construction beginning after June 30, 2026.

Investment, Production Tax Credits

The OBBBA accelerates the phaseout of the investment tax credit under Section 48E and the production tax credit under Section 45Y.

Projects that begin construction after 2033 will generally no longer qualify for these credits, with solar and wind facilities facing even earlier deadlines. To remain eligible, solar and wind projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026, must be placed in service by the end of 2027.

The legislation also introduces new restrictions related to prohibited foreign entities. Facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2025, may not receive material assistance from such entities.

Material assistance is determined based on a cost ratio tied to the sourcing of eligible components. In addition, Section 48E now includes stricter domestic sourcing requirements to obtain the 10% bonus credit, reflecting a broader policy shift toward supply chain security and energy independence.

Importantly, the IRS has tightened the rules for establishing that construction has begun for purposes of the July 4, 2026, deadline for solar and wind facilities.

Under Notice 2025-43, the 5% safe harbor method is available only if taxpayers can use it to establish that construction began by Sept. 1, 2025.

Starting Sept. 2, the physical work test is the sole method for establishing the beginning of construction for wind and solar projects for purposes of the July 4, 2026, deadline.

This change applies to the credit phaseouts under the OBBBA, but not to the foreign entity of concern rules.

For FEOC exemption purposes, facilities may still use the 5% safe harbor to establish that construction began by Dec. 31, 2025.

Additionally, low-output solar facilities (≤1.5 MW AC) may continue to use the 5% safe harbor beyond that date. The four-year continuity safe harbor remains in place for projects that meet BOC requirements.

Historically, taxpayers could rely on either the physical work test or the 5% safe harbor. Notice 2025-42 now limits this to the physical work test, which requires significant physical work related to the energy property, either on-site or off-site, under a binding contract. Preliminary activities, such as design or site clearing, do not qualify.

To maintain credit eligibility, taxpayers must also meet the continuity requirement, which is satisfied if the facility is placed in service within four years of the BOC year.

Advanced Manufacturing Credit

The advanced manufacturing credit under Section 45X has been modified significantly.

While the credit is repealed for wind energy components sold after 2027, it remains available for other eligible components before a phasedown begins in 2031.

Components sold in 2031 will qualify for a 75% credit, decreasing to 50% in 2032 and 25% in 2033.

The credit is fully repealed for sales occurring in 2034 or later. Notably, the scope of the credit has been expanded to include metallurgical coal.

As with other energy provisions, the material assistance restrictions for prohibited foreign entities apply to all qualifying components.

Clean Fuel Production Credit

Under the OBBBA, the clean fuel production credit under Section 45Z has been extended through 2031.

The bill also reinstates the small agri-biodiesel credit under Section 40A, which can now be stacked with the 45Z credit.

A new geographic restriction has been added, disallowing the credit unless the feedstock is produced or grown in Canada, Mexico, or the U.S.

Additionally, the methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions has been revised to exclude indirect land use changes.

Prohibited foreign entity rules have also been extended to apply to clean fuel production facilities.

Planning considerations: Facilities must establish BOC by Dec. 31, 2025, to avoid FEOC restrictions beginning in 2026, and can continue to rely on the 5% safe harbor specifically to meet this deadline through the end of 2025.

Solar and wind projects beginning construction more than 12 months after the OBBBA enactment must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to qualify for Section 48E or 45Y credits.

Facilities that establish BOC by the deadline can rely on the four-year continuity safe harbor to place in service and preserve credit eligibility.

Other Energy Provisions

The clean hydrogen production credit under Section 45V is repealed for construction beginning after 2027—two years later than previously proposed.

Section 45Q credit rates for carbon capture used as a tertiary injectant or for productive use are increased to match those for permanent geologic storage, subject to new foreign-entity restrictions.

Publicly traded partnership rules now include income from carbon capture; nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal energy projects, as well as the transport or storage of sustainable aviation fuel or hydrogen.

The nuclear production credit under Section 45U is also subject to foreign entity restrictions.

Planning considerations: Taxpayers should assess project timelines and sourcing strategies in light of phaseouts and new restrictions. For Sections 45Y and 48E, construction must begin within eligibility windows—especially for solar and wind projects facing a 2027 placed-in-service deadline.

Supply chain planning is critical to avoid disqualification under foreign entity rules. Manufacturers of wind property eligible for Section 45X should consider accelerating production before the phaseout in 2027.

Clean fuel producers must ensure feedstock sourcing complies with geographic limits and updated emissions rules.

Entities pursuing carbon capture, hydrogen, or nuclear projects should factor in expanded PTP eligibility and foreign entity restrictions when structuring financing and partnerships.

Early action can help preserve credit eligibility and provide long-term benefits.

State Tax Credit Transfers

Following the enactment of the OBBBA, many states have expanded or introduced transferable tax credit programs, particularly in clean energy, affordable housing, and infrastructure.

These programs allow taxpayers to sell unused credits to third parties, creating liquidity and broader access to state-level incentives.

Transfer mechanisms vary by state, with some requiring pre-approval, certification, or registration, while others impose annual caps or limits on transfer volume.

The trend mirrors federal credit transferability under Section 6418 and reflects growing interest in flexible credit monetization strategies.

States are also beginning to adopt market infrastructure—such as broker platforms and insurance products—to support credit transfers and mitigate buyer risk.

As more jurisdictions adopt these frameworks, taxpayers with multistate operations should monitor developments closely to identify new opportunities.

Planning considerations: Taxpayers should assess eligibility and timing for generating transferable credits, especially in states with strict certification or sourcing requirements.

Early coordination with legal and tax advisors is essential to confirm compliance with documentation and reporting rules. Buyers should conduct due diligence on project qualification, transfer terms, and potential recapture risks.

Engaging with credit brokers or marketplaces may help improve pricing and identify reliable counterparties.

Additionally, taxpayers should consider how state credit transfers interact with federal incentives, particularly in structuring financing and partnership arrangements.

Strategic planning now can help enhance credit value and avoid missed opportunities as state programs continue to evolve.

New Markets Tax Credit Program Permanent

The New Markets Tax Credit program supports capital investments in low-income communities by offering tax credit-subsidized loans to eligible businesses for use toward eligible costs (e.g., real estate and furniture, fixtures, and equipment).

These loans often feature interest-only terms, below-market rates, and principal forgiveness after seven years, providing businesses with a permanent cash benefit.

Previously set to expire at the end of 2025, the NMTC program was made permanent by the OBBBA, with a continued annual allocation authority of $5 billion.

Eligible businesses—both for-profit and nonprofit—can apply for NMTC financing for capital expenditure projects in qualifying census tracts.

The program supports a wide range of sectors, including manufacturing, healthcare, education, renewable energy, and retail, though it excludes farming and residential rental activities.

Each year, certified Community Development Entities apply to the CDFI Fund for NMTC allocations.

If awarded an allocation, CDEs raise equity from tax credit investors and deploy capital to eligible businesses (otherwise known as Qualified Active Low-Income Community Businesses) based on community impact and strategic priorities, which may vary by geography or industry.

Planning considerations: The NMTC program remains highly competitive. Early engagement with CDEs and timely application are critical to securing financing.

Businesses should prepare detailed project plans that demonstrate substantial community impact and align with CDE priorities.

Acting early improves the likelihood of receiving funding and may unlock additional benefits.

Work Opportunity Tax Credit Set to Expire

The OBBBA did not extend the work opportunity tax credit, which is now set to expire for any individuals who begin work after Dec. 31, 2025.

The WOTC provides a valuable incentive for employers who often hire workers from specific targeted populations, including veterans, people with disabilities, people on food assistance, certain youth employees, and ex-felons.

Employers who frequently screen for qualified individuals as part of their hiring process should monitor the legislative process for a potential extension of the credit.

Pass-Through Deduction

The OBBBA makes permanent the 20% deduction for qualified business income under Section 199A and favorably adjusts the phaseout of the deduction for taxpayers who do not meet the wage expense and capital investment requirements or who participate in a “specified service trade or business.”

Planning considerations: The permanence of this provision provides welcome certainty for private companies engaged in qualifying activities.

The deduction is not available for a range of specified service businesses. There may be opportunities to segregate activities and to increase or allow deductions.

The safe harbor for rental activity to qualify as a Section 199A trade or business under Rev. Proc. 2019-38 remains in effect.

R&D Credit Opportunities

The research credit remains one of the most powerful incentives in the tax code, and the IRS continues to receive a high volume of claims, straining examination resources.

To improve administration and reduce improper claims, the IRS recently made several changes to Form 6765, clarifying documentation requirements for claiming the credit.

The revised Form 6765 was partially finalized for tax year 2025, with the IRS making the mandatory reporting of qualified research expenses by business component optional in Section G.

When Section G becomes mandatory for the 2026 tax year, taxpayers will be required to disclose the top 80% of QREs, with controlled group members required to attach detailed entity-level breakdowns.

Section E is currently mandatory and includes new questions related to officer wages, acquisitions, and use of the ASC 730 directive.

These updates reflect the IRS’s ongoing efforts to enhance transparency and strengthen audit readiness.

In response to ongoing compliance concerns, the IRS has increased scrutiny of research credit filings, including more frequent audits.

However, due to temporary resource constraints, some IRS Exam functions are operating at reduced capacity, which may delay enforcement actions.

Taxpayers should confirm that they are properly documenting claims and exploring state credit opportunities.

State Credit Changes

Over the past year, several states have enacted or revised legislation related to research and development tax credits. These changes reflect a growing trend to incentivize innovation and attract high-tech investment.

These states include:

Arizona: Arizona now permits the use of the alternative simplified credit (ASC) method for computing its credit for increased research activities. This provides greater flexibility and may lead to greater benefits. Refundable credits are available for small businesses with fewer than 150 employees, subject to pre-approval from the Arizona Commerce Authority.

Arkansas: Arkansas expanded its credit options, offering up to 33% for strategic research areas and university partnerships. Credits are nonrefundable but can offset 100% of state tax liability and be carried forward for up to nine years.

Connecticut: Connecticut expanded its R&D and R&E credits under H.B. 7287. Single-member LLCs may now qualify if they meet specific criteria. Refundability increased to 90% for small biotech firms and 65% for other small businesses, capped at $1.5 million per company annually.

Iowa: Iowa enacted Senate File 657, replacing its research activities credit with a targeted R&D tax credit program effective Jan. 1, 2026. Eligibility is limited to sectors such as advanced manufacturing, bioscience, finance, insurance, and technology. Credits are capped at $40 million annually and require CPA-verified QREs and a competitive application process through the Iowa Economic Development Authority.

Massachusetts: Massachusetts increased the maximum allowable credit for certain industries and introduced new documentation requirements for software development and AI-related R&D.

Michigan: Effective Jan. 1, 2025, Michigan reintroduced its R&D tax credit. Large businesses may claim 3% of qualifying expenses up to a base amount and 10% above it, capped at $2 million. Small businesses may claim 15% above the base amount, capped at $250,000. An additional 5% credit is available for university collaborations, capped at $200,000. The credit is refundable and subject to an annual cap of $100 million.

Minnesota: Minnesota introduced partial refundability for its R&D credit: 19.2% for 2025, increasing to 25% for 2026–2027.

Oklahoma: Oklahoma revised its R&D credit to align more closely with federal QRE definitions and introduced a new pre-approval application process.

Texas: Texas enhanced its franchise tax R&D credit via SB 2206 and repealed the R&D equipment sales tax exemption effective Jan. 1, 2026.

Planning considerations: Navigating the R&D credit has become more complex amid heightened review, evolving case law, and new compliance measures.

Taxpayers should make sure claims are well-supported and consistent with updated guidance to reduce audit risk and avoid delays.

Taxpayers should carefully assess eligibility for both federal and state research credits, maintain contemporaneous documentation, and prepare to defend claims under examination.

Strategic planning is essential to leveraging available incentives, especially given the complexity and variability of state-level programs.

Using a trusted tax advisor can help taxpayers maintain compliance with IRS and state regulations and effectively substantiate research credit claims.

Rules Changed for Qualified Small Business Stock

The OBBBA significantly enhances a tax-efficient structuring option for private companies. Qualified small business stock under Section 1202 offers tax-free appreciation and has been increasingly used by private equity in recent years.

Enacted in 1993, Section 1202 generally allows a non-corporate taxpayer to exclude a percentage of the gain from the sale or exchange of QSBS held for more than five years.

The eligible gain exclusion percentage is based on the date the stock is issued.

For stock issued before July 5, 2025, the maximum amount of gain on QSBS that can be excluded for any tax year by each taxpayer with respect to each issuing C corporation is generally limited to the greater of: (i) $10 million, minus the amount of gain excluded by that taxpayer in prior years with respect to the same issuing corporation; or (ii) 10 times the taxpayer’s aggregate adjusted basis in the QSBS sold during the tax year.

For stock issued after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA increases the $10 million limit to $15 million and adjusts this limit for inflation beginning in 2027. In addition, the OBBBA creates new 50% and 75% gain exclusion categories for QSBS held for at least three and four years, respectively.

The various QSBS exclusion percentages, exclusion limits, and required holding periods by stock issuance date are set out in the table below.

The OBBBA also increases the limit on aggregate gross assets to satisfy the qualified small business test for purposes of Section 1202. These thresholds are now as follows:

At all times through the date of issuance, the corporation’s aggregate gross assets must not have exceeded $50 million for issuances before July 5, 2025, or $75 million for issuances after July 4, 2025; and

Immediately after the date of issuance (and after considering amounts the corporation received in the issuance), the aggregate gross assets of the corporation must not exceed $50 million or $75 million for issuances before July 5, 2025, or after July 4, 2025, respectively. Aggregate gross assets are defined as cash plus the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the corporation’s other assets.

Planning considerations: After an issuance is deemed to be QSBS under Section 1202, the corporation’s gross assets can exceed the applicable threshold (either $50 million or $75 million) at a later date without prohibiting the previously issued stock from receiving Section 1202 treatment.

By increasing the threshold, the OBBBA renews an existing corporation’s ability to issue QSBS if their aggregate gross assets have exceeded $50 million in the past but have never exceeded $75 million.

This higher threshold also expands the potential QSBS benefits for private equity firms when acquiring target businesses with enterprise values of up to $75 million.

Opportunity Zone Extension

The OBBBA made the qualified opportunity zone program permanent, preserving one of the most generous tax incentives ever offered by Congress.

The provision can offer benefits to investors looking for tax-efficient returns, individual private companies investing in specific geographies, or asset managers setting up funds.

The OBBBA not only makes the program permanent, but it also changes the rules in essential ways. Funds and investors should consider the implications for their planning strategies.

The changes could affect the timing of gain transactions and capital contributions, the location of investments, and the compliance burdens for funds.

The current QOZ designations will expire at the end of 2026. New zones will be designated in rolling 10-year designation periods under new criteria that are expected to shrink the number of qualifying zones.

Under the current program, taxpayers can defer capital gains by investing in a qualified opportunity fund.

For investments made after 2026, taxpayers will be required to recognize the deferred gain five years after investing, but will receive a 10% increase in basis for holding the investment for five years. For QOFs operating in a new category of rural opportunity zones, this basis increase is 30%.

Taxpayers who make investments before the end of 2026 must still recognize the deferred gain at the end of 2026.

The more powerful tax benefit may be the tax-free appreciation on the underlying investment itself. Taxpayers will still receive a full basis step-up to fair market value for property held 10 years, but the OBBBA added a rule freezing the basis step-up to the FMV at 30 years after the date of the investment.

The operational rules for QOFs and qualified opportunity zone businesses are generally unchanged, except for property held in a rural opportunity zone.

The threshold for establishing the substantial improvement of qualifying property in a rural opportunity zone will be 50% of the basis rather than 100%, effective for any determinations after July 4, 2025.

QOFs and QOZBs will both be subject to increased reporting requirements.

Companies looking for new tax-efficient investing opportunities and gain deferral strategies should reassess their investment options, paying particular attention to which geographies are likely to qualify in 2027.

Planning considerations: The timing of capital gains transactions will be important. Delaying a capital gain transaction could allow taxpayers to make a deferral election in 2027 and defer recognizing the gain until well after the current 2026 recognition date.

Conversely, taxpayers planning investments in geographic areas that are unlikely to be redesignated may need to make the investments before the end of 2026.

Existing QOFs and QOZBs should consider their long-term capital needs because it is not clear whether any “grandfathering” relief will allow additional qualified investments in funds operating in QOZs that are not redesignated.

The new reporting rules will apply to both new and existing QOZs and QOZBs for tax years beginning after the date of enactment, and those entities will need to collect and report substantial new information that has never before been required.

REIT Structuring, Real Estate Benefits

The real estate investment tax structure remains an effective way to structure certain real estate activities with only one layer of tax.

The OBBBA raises from 20% to 25% the portion of the gross asset value of a REIT that may be attributable to equity and debt securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries, effective for tax years beginning after 2025. The change should provide added flexibility.

In addition, the OBBBA allows the completed contract method of accounting for many residential condominium, construction, and sale projects, effective for contracts entered into after July 4, 2025.

For residential developers that meet the average annual gross receipts test under Section 448 ($31 million in 2025), the maximum estimated contract length is increased from two to three years to qualify for the exception from the UNICAP rules under Section 263A.

Planning considerations: This provision provides much-needed tax relief to condo developers who had to report income under the percentage-of-completion method, which often required reporting income before receiving payment.

Allowing the use of the completed contract method of accounting allows better matching of reporting taxable income with the receipt of cash by the developer.

Unfortunately, the relief is provided only prospectively for contracts entered into after the July 4, 2025, enactment date.

Therefore, taxpayers with contracts entered into before the enactment date will continue to be subject to the old rules.

Moreover, reporting income for projects begun in prior years may be bound to the prior method of accounting.",https://www.cbia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tax-Analysis_092518.png,N,,2025-12-29 12:57:13.894987

This consolidates Repsol’s position as the most important 100% renewable fuel networks in Europe.

Repsol demonstrates that renewable liquid fuels are a real option to reduce CO₂ emissions from transportation.

100% renewable Nexa Diesel is Repsol's highest-end fuel. It has an exclusive formulation that optimizes performance and extends the lifespan of the engine.

Repsol has reached a new milestone in its strategy to decarbonize transport by surpassing 1,500 service stations – 1,429 in Spain and 71 in Portugal – supplying Nexa Diesel of 100% renewable origin. This step forward reaffirms the company's commitment to renewable fuels and expands the range of technologies made available to support customers’ mobility, thus, meeting the objective outlined in the update of the company’s 2024-2027 strategic plan.

With this achievement, Repsol consolidates its position as the most relevant 100% renewable fuel networks in Europe, reaching more than 210 million liters sold so far this year. Currently, more than 40% of the company’s network of service stations offers renewable fuel, demonstrating that decarbonizing transport with renewable liquid fuels is a viable solution for combustion engine vehicles. These vehicles today represent 97% of the Spanish and European vehicle fleet, and 87% of sales in Spain so far this year.

To meet the climate targets set by Spain and the European Union, it is essential to recognize the role of 100% renewable fuels to reducing CO₂ emissions from combustion engines.

The 100% renewable Nexa Diesel, identified by its pink color, is Repsol's highest-end fuel. It has an exclusive formulation that optimizes performance, extends engine life, and is designed for all diesel engines. It is produced from raw materials of renewable origin and, with current technology, it already reduces the carbon footprint by up to 90% compared to the conventional fuel it replaces, thanks to the lower carbon intensity of the renewable fuel due to its organic origin.

Valero Marín, Executive Managing Director of Repsol’s Client Business, said: ""Reaching 1,500 service stations that supply 100% renewable Nexa Diesel marks a key step forward in our strategy to decarbonize transport. This milestone reaffirms Repsol's commitment to reducing CO₂ emissions and expanding solutions for our customers' mobility.

Renewable fuels. To decarbonize mobility, Repsol is committed to a model that combines all solutions that reduce emissions, such as renewable fuels, electrification, AutoGas, and renewable hydrogen, which the company is developing. The company’s vision is that all energy options, including conventional fuels combined with ultra-efficient engines, must be taken into account to guarantee supply, meet the needs of each customer, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions as quickly and cost-efficiently as possible.

Repsol already operates the first plant in the Iberian Peninsula to produce 100% renewable fuels on a large scale, in Cartagena, producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel. In 2026, it will add a second plant at its Puertollano industrial complex, with the annual capacity to produce an additional 200,000 tons of 100% renewable fuel for road and maritime transport.

In addition to this, Repsol has also developed 100% renewable gasoline after more than two decades of research. Nexa 95 Gasoline, the company's highest quality 95-octane fuel, incorporates an exclusive formulation designed in the Repsol Technology Lab in Madrid and produced at the Tarragona complex to optimize the performance of the engine and keep it in optimal conditions. This fuel is already available at 30 service stations in the Spanish regions of Madrid, Catalonia, Valencia, the Basque Country, and Aragon.

This move was designed to boost domestic soybean oil demand but has ironically led to a period of ""crush margin compression.""
Consequently, the soybean oil premium over palm oil, which peaked at $247/mt in mid-2025, has narrowed significantly to approximately $50/mt as of late December.
Historically, soybean oil prices were tethered to soybean meal—the protein used for animal feed.
In 2025, however, soybean oil has increasingly traded in parallel with crude oil and the ""POGO"" (Palm Oil-Gasoil) spread.","As 2025 draws to a close, the global agricultural markets are witnessing a fundamental restructuring of the relationship between the world’s two most important vegetable oils. For decades, the price spread between soybean oil and palm oil was dictated by harvest cycles and kitchen demand. However, as of December 29, 2025, that historical logic has been largely discarded, replaced by a volatile, policy-driven dynamic fueled by aggressive biofuel mandates in Southeast Asia and a protectionist shift in United States energy policy.

The immediate implications are stark: the ""food vs. fuel"" debate has evolved into a full-scale competition for feedstock dominance. With Indonesia aggressively locking down its palm oil supply for domestic energy and the U.S. implementing strict domestic-only requirements for biofuel tax credits, the global ""fat gap"" is narrowing. This has created a ""wait-and-see"" volatility where prices for Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE: ADM) and Bunge Global SA (NYSE: BG) are now more sensitive to carbon-intensity scores and legislative ""Regulatory Freezes"" than to actual crop yields.

A Year of Policy Shocks and Narrowing Spreads

The primary catalyst for this market transformation was the implementation of Indonesia’s B40 mandate on January 1, 2025. By requiring a 40% palm-based blend in domestic diesel, Indonesia effectively placed a ""floor"" under palm oil prices, curtailing exports and driving Bursa Malaysia futures to hover between 4,100 and 4,500 ringgit (~$970–$1,050/mt) throughout the year. This aggressive move was further complicated by President Prabowo Subianto’s push for a B50 mandate. While technical hurdles have led the government to consider a B45 interim step for 2026, the signal to the market was clear: palm oil is no longer just a cooking ingredient; it is a strategic energy reserve.

In the United States, the passage of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" (OBBB) in July 2025 sent shockwaves through the soybean complex. The legislation extended the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit but introduced a ""North American-only"" feedstock requirement. This move was designed to boost domestic soybean oil demand but has ironically led to a period of ""crush margin compression."" Refiners, uncertain of the final carbon-intensity (CI) scoring guidance due to a late-year regulatory freeze, have been hesitant to sign long-term contracts. Consequently, the soybean oil premium over palm oil, which peaked at $247/mt in mid-2025, has narrowed significantly to approximately $50/mt as of late December.

Winners and Losers in the New Regulatory Landscape

The divergence in corporate performance this year has been a tale of two strategies: global agility versus domestic concentration. Bunge Global SA (NYSE: BG) has emerged as a relative winner, successfully integrating its $7.3 billion acquisition of Viterra. This massive footprint has allowed Bunge to navigate regional trade bottlenecks and leverage strong South American processing capacity to offset thin margins in North America. Conversely, Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE: ADM) has struggled, significantly slashing its 2025 guidance after reporting a 93% drop in 3Q crushing profits. ADM’s heavy reliance on the U.S. domestic market made it particularly vulnerable to the 45Z policy delays and the resulting margin squeeze.

In the specialized biofuel sector, Darling Ingredients (NYSE: DAR) has positioned itself as a ""clear winner"" of the OBBB Act. By controlling the largest North American network for waste fats, such as used cooking oil (UCO) and tallow, Darling has created a protective moat. Foreign competitors like Neste (HEL: NESTE) have been forced to re-optimize their global flows, moving Singapore-produced shipments away from the U.S. and toward the European Union to meet ReFuelEU aviation mandates. While Neste's Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) volumes tripled in 2025, its margins have faced pressure from the loss of U.S. subsidy eligibility for its non-North American feedstocks.

The Energy-Linked Decoupling

The wider significance of these shifts lies in the ""industrial decoupling"" of vegetable oils from the broader agricultural complex. Historically, soybean oil prices were tethered to soybean meal—the protein used for animal feed. In 2025, however, soybean oil has increasingly traded in parallel with crude oil and the ""POGO"" (Palm Oil-Gasoil) spread. This energy-linkage means that agricultural traders now spend as much time analyzing OPEC+ production cuts as they do South American weather patterns.

Furthermore, the ""North American-first"" policy in the U.S. has triggered a global ripple effect. By effectively banning imported Chinese UCO and Brazilian tallow for subsidized fuel production, the U.S. has forced these feedstocks into the European and Asian markets, creating a two-tiered pricing system for ""low-carbon"" fats. This regulatory fragmentation is reshaping global trade routes, with ""green"" fuels flowing toward the highest subsidy regimes rather than the most efficient logistical paths. Historical precedents, such as the 2007 Renewable Fuel Standard, pale in comparison to the sheer volume of vegetable oil now being diverted from plates to fuel tanks.

The Road Ahead: B50 and the SAF Frontier

Looking toward 2026, the market is bracing for the next phase of this transition. The short-term focus remains on the U.S. Treasury’s final 45Z guidance, which will determine the exact value of tax credits based on farming practices. If the guidance favors ""climate-smart"" agriculture, we could see a massive influx of investment into low-CI soybean production. Meanwhile, Indonesia’s potential move to B45 or B50 remains the ""X-factor"" for palm oil. A full B50 implementation would require nearly 20 million kiloliters of palm oil annually, a volume that could theoretically eliminate Indonesia’s export surplus and send global vegetable oil prices into a new stratosphere.

The long-term opportunity lies in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). With major carriers like DHL Express signing massive offtake agreements with Neste, and Darling Ingredients scaling its Port Arthur facility to upgrade half of its capacity to SAF, the aviation sector is becoming the new ""must-serve"" customer. For companies like Wilmar International (SGX: F34), the challenge will be maintaining access to the European market under the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) while simultaneously feeding the growing energy hunger of the Southeast Asian domestic market.

Final Thoughts for the 2026 Investor

The era of ""cheap"" vegetable oil appears to be a relic of the past. As we enter 2026, the market has transitioned from being supply-driven to being policy-driven. While record harvests in Brazil might traditionally suggest lower prices, the voracious appetite of the biofuel and SAF sectors is effectively neutralizing any supply surplus. For investors, the key takeaway is that agricultural stocks are now, for all intents and purposes, energy stocks.

Moving forward, the primary indicators to watch are the Palm Oil-Gasoil spread, the finalization of the 45Z carbon scoring, and any shifts in Southeast Asian export levies. The ""fat gap"" is real, and as the world’s transportation sectors look to decarbonize, the humble soybean and oil palm have become the most contested commodities on the planet.

Against the ""high-carbon lock-in""dilemma in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industrialization, which is caused by high costs, insufficient supply, and a lack of policy coordination, this study takes the logic of ""subject behavior coordination-phased management -policy tool adaptation"" as the core and constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model involving the government, airlines, and fuel producers. It systematically examines the initial, development, and maturity stages of SAF industrialization. By establishing dynamic replication equations, solving Jacobian matrices, and conducting numerical simulations, this study clearly reveals the evolutionary paths and equilibrium conditions of the strategic interactions among the three parties at different stages. The results show that in the initial stage, a high-intensity policy combination of ""government subsidies covering more than 60% of airlines' SAF purchase premium + high carbon tax"" must be implemented to break the ""high-carbon lock-in""deadlock during the introduction period of industrialization. In the development stage, to address the bottleneck of ""weak supply-demand coordination"", airlines need to bear no less than 33.3% of fuel producers' R&D costs through investment and provide a profit share of no less than 15%. Moreover, the intensity of the carbon tax should be increased to more than 1.6 times the original level. In addition, a ""dual-drive mechanism integrating push and pull""should be built that relies on ""green finance + offtake agreements + industrial chain equity investment"". In the mature stage, the carbon quota price for airlines should be set such that the selling price is at least 0.75 times the purchase cost. Under this premise, the SAF will gradually gain cost competitiveness and economies of scale.

I et land som Norge, bygget på olje og gass, besitter vi enormt med kunnskap om næringen, men for å klare en energiomstilling kreves det en helt unik kompetanse.

Kompetanse som St1 bringer med seg når de nå setter sitt preg på stasjonene sine over hele Norge. For til tross for å ha vært til stede i Norge i over 10 år allerede, er det først nå de heiser stasjonsflaggene med egen logo.

Stasjonene, som tidligere var under varemerket Shell, kalles derfor nå for St1. Et viktig steg for å klare visjonen.

Og du finner de i alle retninger: sør, nord, øst og vest.

St1 selger fortsatt mest av bensin og diesel, men tilgangen til en bred energimiks gjør at forbrukere kan ta smartere valg ved pumpa.

– Når alle har tilgang til klimabevisst energi, kan de ta et mer bevisst valg på hvilken energi de skal bruke.

Det forteller Erlend Føleide, Head of marketing hos St1.

– Det er viktig for at vi, samfunnet, skal nå klimamålene våre.

Å kunne tilby klimabevisst energi krever at man bruker alle resursene tilgjengelig, og tenker utenfor de tradisjonelle banene.

For St1 betyr det blant annet å ta en ekstra titt på kjøkkenet.

Ikke et typisk energiselskap

St1s synlighet langs norske veier er med andre ord langt mer enn bare et navneskifte.

Energiomstillingen skjer ikke av seg selv. Man må tørre å gå opp nye spor og det blir kun mulig dersom absolutt alle er med på laget.

Også prisene spiller på lag.

– For at bærekraftig energi skal være attraktiv, må prisene være det, sier Føleide.

I tillegg må alle ha tilgang til energi. Derfor produsere St1 energi til både sjø- og luftfart, bygger ut ladenettverket for elbiler i rekordfart og produserer biogass til tungtransport.

Når alle har tilgang til bærekraftig energi, kan alle være med på å ta bærekraftige valg.

Det er en viktig forutsetning for å styrke konkurranseevnen og effektiviteten, men også for å ta eierskap over en energiomstilling.

St1 legger som sagt ikke skjul på at tradisjonell olje –bensin og diesel – fortsatt er en stor del av «energiporteføljen».

– I tillegg til fokuset på energiomstillingen vet vi at kundene er opptatt av prisen i masten.

– Derfor jobber vi hele tiden med å tilby en attraktiv pris for kundene, sier Føleide.

Målet er å gjøre det lettere for mennesker og bedrifter å velge energi med lavere utslipp – uansett om den kommer fra strøm, biogass eller andre drivstoffer med lavt utslipp.

For St1 handler altså omstillingen ikke om å snakke om fremtiden, men om å bidra til å forme den – steg for steg, stasjon for stasjon

The engines being developed by Los Angeles-based Heart and ZeroAvia, which has twin bases in Seattle and Cotswold airport in Gloucestershire, will – initially at least – produce nowhere near enough thrust to get a full-sized airliner off the runway, he said.

But if they work as advertised, they will be sufficient to power the fleet of propeller planes that Loganair uses on its routes to Scottish islands and cities across the UK.

Loganair is encouraging travellers to get ahead with their 2026 staycation plans as it launches its Tartan Sale, offering 17% off flights across its network.

Running from today (Monday, 29 December) until Thursday, 8 January 2026, this gives customers the chance to secure reduced fares for travel from Monday, 2 February 2026, ideal for early spring breaks, short escapes and planned visits across the UK and island communities. The discount is available by using the promo code WINTER17 at the time of booking. Bookings must be made via loganair.co.uk, the Loganair app or by calling Loganair’s Customer Help Centre. The discount applies to the net fare only and is subject to availability. Exclusions apply.

Those routes include the world’s shortest scheduled flight at just 90 seconds between Papa Westray and Westray in Orkney; and the only scheduled beach landing, on Barra. Mr Farajallah said a “conversation” had begun with Transport Scotland about fitting the engine into one of two Twin Otter planes that operate to Campbeltown,Tiree and Barra under Public Service Obligation contracts.

Mr Farajallah told the Daily Telegraph that Loganair's unique network, with flights averaging 35 minutes, makes the foray into electric propulsion a hard-nosed business decision.

“If you’re going to use less fuel and have a lower carbon footprint while lowering your costs, and the components in the engine are going to be less complicated and need changing less, then it’s a compelling proposition.""

However, Mr Farajallah questioned the speed at which both Scotland and the UK are running down the oil and gas industry, to which the fortunes of Loganair have been closely tied through its services to Aberdeen and Shetland.

He said: “Offshore oil is critically important to our business, our industry and to Scotland and it’s my view that the levers that are being pulled within Government are a bit too extreme.

“There is an assumption that everyone who is working in oil and gas will transition across to renewables, and that isn’t the case. There’s a whole range of skills that are not immediately transferable. It’s different technology, research, universities, background and experience.”

Mr Farajallah was also critical of the extent to which switching to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), mostly derived from used cooking oil, has come to dominate thinking around decarbonising aviation, both within the industry and across governments.

With SAF costing four to five times as much as kerosene, a UK requirement to use a 10pc blend of the propellant by 2030 will push costs dangerously high for a regional airline sector where established players are already collapsing under the weight of high taxation, he said.

Mr Farajallah was previously operations chief at Flybe until 2018. He also worked at Wizz Air, easyJet, British Airways and Bond Helicopters, which transported crews to North Sea oil rigs.

Loganair was named Sustainable Airline of the Year for 2024 by the European Regional Airline Association (ERA for its concrete steps towards reducing its environmental footprint.

Judges highlighted Loganair’s collaboration with Cranfield Aerospace Solutions to convert its Britten Norman Islander aircraft, which operates inter-island routes in Orkney, to hydrogen cell power. They also praised Loganair’s first all-electric turnaround of an aircraft at Stornoway Airport, where the airline is in the process of replacing over 100 pieces of ground service equipment (GSE) to reduce emissions further.

Demand for petrol and diesel is falling, environmental regulations are tightening, and the region’s refineries, many of which were built in the 1970s or earlier, are operating well beyond their original design life. As a result, operators are having to make stark choices about whether to reinvest, repurpose, or plan a phased exit. This is where master planning can offer Europe’s refineries a strategic reset.

There are still around 73 operational refineries around Europe (excluding Russia), with a combined capacity of roughly 14 million bpd.1 However, since 2009, around 30 refineries in the region have either closed or been converted with many more looking economically unviable.2 This is due to a combination of falling margins, policy pressure, and ageing infrastructure.

At the same time, ownership is shifting. As oil majors divest from legacy assets, a new wave of operators have entered the market.3 These new owners are typically smaller, equity-focused businesses, who do not always have the same depth of in-house refining expertise or legacy system knowledge, and who are struggling to train and retain suitably experienced personnel. Instead, they typically rely on external support to manage complex assets.

This is where strategic master planning can help. The approach is designed to help operators assess their options using a structured, cross-disciplinary process that connects asset condition, market dynamics, operational risk, and workforce capability into a single roadmap. For refinery owners looking for their next steps it offers a strategic reset.

What master planning involves

Master planning is defined as a decision-making framework for complex assets. It is used to extend life, improve performance, or transition an asset to a new purpose or, in some cases, to exit in a managed way that preserves value. The process integrates technical assessments, commercial modelling, regulatory compliance, and capability planning.

At its core, master planning addresses five common ‘burning points’ that directly affect refinery profitability:

Feedstock optimisation: where selecting and configuring feed can maximise margin.

Fixed and operating cost control: which focuses on improving efficiency and reducing overheads.

Better application of technology: to ensure investment is targeted where it delivers real value.

Revenue improvement: whether through yield optimisation or changes to the product mix.

Regulatory readiness: to make sure the asset remains compliant now and in the future.

The process begins by clarifying the strategic direction. Is the asset intended to operate for another 10 or 20 years? Is there a transition plan in place to convert it into a fuel import terminal, hydrogen hub, or biofuels site? Does the site need to prepare for decommissioning in the near-term? The answers to these questions will determine the focus of the master plan. At this stage, it is also important to identify the investment appetite, operational constraints, and stakeholder priorities that will determine what is possible.

The next step involves a deep dive into the asset itself. In KBR’s master planning process, the company carries out structured data collection and reviews the existing infrastructure, which involves on-site inspections and desktop analysis. This process aims to get a clear picture of the full, current state of the facility, including the process unit condition, equipment criticality, maintenance effectiveness, backlog and spares strategy, yield and loss performance, utility systems, and regulatory compliance. During the process, documentation and technical reviews are carried out, along with condition grading and risk-based evaluation of failure.

Once this information is collated, it is possible to compare this detailed assessment against the business goals, carrying out margin and market analysis to identify what can be optimised and where capital investment is justified. A configuration review assesses whether the asset’s current layout and process capability is aligned with future product needs and policy requirements. Technology screening is used to identify areas where reliability, emissions, or product flexibility can be improved. Finally, a regulatory compliance review is carried out to make sure the site’s permits, environmental obligations, and reporting frameworks meet its future needs.

From here, the master plan can be developed and would include a series of recommendations for short-term improvement actions and long-term transformation options, which are sequenced around the asset’s maintenance and turnaround cycles. KBR typically facilitates a series of interactive workshops at this point with client stakeholders to prioritise actions, evaluate trade-offs, and develop a realistic, risk-managed roadmap.

The cost of inaction

Many refinery decisions are tied to the turnaround cycle, which typically takes place every four to six years. This is the window where major upgrades, decommissioning, or reconfiguration can be carried out. If operators miss that window, the next opportunity might not come until the end of the decade.

More than 400 000 bpd of refining capacity is now confirmed to shut in 2025. This includes Petroineos’ Grangemouth refinery in Scotland, Shell’s Wesseling site in Germany, part of BP’s Gelsenkirchen complex, and the Prax Lindsey Oil Refinery in England, which is now in formal wind-down after entering administration in June 2025 and failing to secure a buyer.

This is why, when facing uncertainty about the long-term future of an asset, any delays can be costly. A full-site turnaround can result in significant direct and indirect costs. Lost production alone can equate to over US$3 million per day in foregone margin, regardless of whether the shutdown is for maintenance or unplanned.

Over time, the performance gap between average and top-performing refineries can reach US$20 - 50 million in margin annually. In environments that are sensitive to these margins, these figures can determine whether a site remains viable at all. However, making even small operational improvements – in areas such as scheduling, asset care, or spares strategy – can unlock marginal gains.

Master planning in practice

KBR engaged with a European refinery which was struggling to remain competitive and to carry out sustainable operations. It was suffering from the ‘perfect storm’: a changing crude slate, government-imposed carbon taxes, and rising energy costs with a rapidly evolving product demand profile. Added to this, its parent oil major company had divested the asset to a consortium of smaller traders, starving it of access to leading-edge standards/procedures and a dearth of technical support.

A market study found a mismatch between product slate and demand, identifying the opportunity to revise fuel specifications and to embrace bi-directional trading of intermediates with other refiners and petrochemical facilities in the region. Similarly, a new crude pipeline from a nearby marine terminal facilitated added flexibility to process alternative imported crude oils.

KBR simulated the existing refinery configuration in HYSYS and specified modifications including changes to crude distillation unit (CDU) cut-points with minor debottlenecking throughout the refinery. The changes were implemented with an accelerated schedule to take advantage of the next turnaround and ended up costing approximately US$86 million while achieving an increase in revenue of approximately US$72 million. Greater operational flexibility was achieved with new trading partners creating a more sustainable and long-term horizon.

Work is continuing to address the availability of suitably qualified technical staff and to review and update the internal management system with a view to achieving improved availability, lower maintenance, and general operating costs.

It is a similar case across Europe, where many refineries are evaluating their future role and whether they can pivot toward producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), integrate hydrogen infrastructure, or act as anchor sites for carbon capture. These changes require more than just technical upgrades: they require a phased approach to investment, permitting, off-take agreements, and workforce transition, all of which must be considered in the master plan.

Planning for more than equipment

It is important to remember that master planning is not just about the physical asset. It also looks at the wider systems, tools, and teams needed to operate reliably and competitively.

For example, digital tools play a key role, including computerised maintenance management system (CMMS) integration, predictive maintenance, and asset analytics. KBR’s use of Maximo and other platforms helps clients optimise maintenance scheduling, manage spares, and reduce downtime without major capital spend.

Just as important is capability development. As refineries adapt, whether into energy hubs, import terminals, or cleaner fuel producers, their organisational needs change too. KBR’s planning approach includes team structure design, role profiles, training pathways, and knowledge transfer.

This includes workforce capability mapping, organisational design, and succession planning for ageing subject matter experts. In many cases, master planning reveals not just what assets need to change, but what people, skills, and decision-making processes must evolve alongside them.

A new kind of readiness

Clarity is hard to come by in today’s refining market, but waiting for certainty is not an option. Strategic master planning does not eliminate uncertainty, but it does create the space to act, to prepare, and to respond with intent. For some sites, that might mean extending life through targeted reinvestment. For others, it could mean preparing for phased shutdown, conversion, or repurposing. What matters is that there is a strategic plan in place. For any operator looking to understand their options and take control of what comes next, that may be the most valuable investment they can make.

Uganda Airlines, the country's revived national carrier, has in recent months been plagued by setbacks that mirror the wider struggles of African aviation.

Just this month, passengers traveling to Dubai and other destinations were stranded for days following technical faults that left aircraft grounded in Lagos and London. Reports of poor communication, lack of accommodation, and even police intervention in Dubai to secure meals for affected travelers sparked public outrage.

The airline, already hemorrhaging losses--nearly shs300 billion (about USD 80 million) in 2024 alone--faces accusations of mismanagement, including concerns over leadership qualifications and executive remuneration that reportedly far exceeds that of counterparts at profitable airlines such as Ethiopian Airlines.

These incidents are not isolated. They reflect a continent-wide aviation crisis in which national carriers struggle under operational constraints, rising costs, weak governance, and fierce competition from well-capitalized global airlines.

Africa's aviation sector, despite leading global growth in passenger numbers in the post-pandemic period, remains structurally constrained. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects African airlines will generate only USD 0.2 billion in profits in 2025, translating into a razor-thin 1.1 percent net margin, far below the global average.

Fragmented markets and restrictive policies continue to hinder seamless operations. High fuel costs, excessive taxes, airport charges, and blocked funds--where governments restrict the repatriation of airline revenues--further erode viability. Safety concerns persist, with Africa recording an accident rate of 1.1 per million flights in 2025, pointing to infrastructure gaps and regulatory weaknesses.

Geopolitical tensions compound these challenges. Conflicts force costly rerouting of flights, while security risks in volatile regions raise insurance and operational costs. Meanwhile, intra-African connectivity remains limited: only 20 percent of air travel within Africa is intra-continental, compelling passengers to make expensive detours through Europe or the Middle East.

Uganda Airlines' struggles echo those of other African carriers, including Kenya Airways, which has grappled with heavy debt and repeated government bailouts despite strategic partnerships with KLM. Across the continent, airlines face common operational constraints, fleet underutilization, and the harsh reality of competing against entrenched global and regional giants.

While governance reforms and private-sector partnerships offer part of the solution, national fixes alone are insufficient. Africa needs a bolder, collective vision.

Africa's aviation future lies in a joint Pan-African airline, owned by continental shareholders and aligned with the African Union's integration agenda. Such a carrier--an ""Air Africa"" for the modern era--could pool resources, spread risk, and harness collective strength.

Equity could be distributed among member states based on population size, GDP, or aviation needs. With economies of scale, a joint airline would be better positioned to negotiate favorable fuel contracts, aircraft leases, insurance, and maintenance agreements--costs that currently cripple smaller national operators.

Shared fleets would improve aircraft utilization and operational resilience, addressing issues such as limited wide-body availability that contributed to Uganda Airlines' recent disruptions. By prioritizing underserved routes, the airline could significantly boost intra-African connectivity and support trade under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).

Tourism would benefit immensely from affordable, direct flights between cities such as Lagos and Johannesburg or Nairobi and Dakar--unlocking billions of dollars in potential GDP growth.

The benefits extend beyond balance sheets. A Pan-African airline would symbolize unity and shared purpose, echoing the vision of the now-defunct Air Afrique, which connected West African nations from the 1960s until the early 2000s. Its failure offers lessons: the need for transparent governance, professional management, and insulation from political interference.

With a multinational board combining public oversight and private-sector expertise, accountability could be strengthened. Sustainability would also gain momentum. Collective bargaining for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could help overcome current barriers such as high costs and regulatory gaps, positioning Africa as a future leader in green aviation.

Critics may argue that Africa's fragmentation makes such a venture unrealistic, citing past alliance failures. Yet recent developments--including Kenya Airways' evolving partnerships and the ongoing implementation of the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM)--suggest growing momentum toward liberalization and cooperation.

National pride alone cannot sustain loss-making airlines. Smart, continent-wide partnerships can.

By uniting as shareholders, African nations can transform aviation from a perennial loss-maker into a powerful engine of integration, trade, and shared prosperity. For Uganda Airlines and its peers, the future may not lie in isolated revival, but in rebirth through solidarity.

Next time you get on a long haul flight and find your seat, here's some food for thought. The plane may well be powered in part by old cooking oil. From eateries in Beijing to street food stalls in Malaysia, The global aviation industry has promised to hit net 0 emissions by 2050 and is banking on one crucial ingredient to get there. Safe or sustainable aviation fuel. Fuel made from waste like. Used cooking oil in agricultural leftovers instead of crude oil. SAF can cut life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to around 80% compared with conventional jet fuel, depending on the feedstock and process. And it is already in the tanks of some of the world's biggest airlines like Australia's national airline Qantas. Safe is going to be a massive part of aviations decarbonization pathway. It is absolutely critical to be able to decarbonise. Long haul airlines like Qantas. Fiona MSN is chief sustainability officer for Qantas. She says the airline has set a target to cut its overall emissions by 25% by 20-30 with staff as a key strategy. Messent hopes to establish Sydney Airport as a major staff hub and refueling point in the region. The key challenge that will need to be unlocked is how do you get to the scale of supply necessary at the right cost. All airlines? So where will all that extra fuel come from? A 2025 IR to report says staff output currently only covers an estimated .7% of airlines fuel needs globally. For airlines to meet their targets, new staff suppliers are crucial in Malaysia and new plant is giving a glimpse of what a waste only future could look like. Here in the southern region of Johor, Hong Kong based biofuels company Echo Series has built this state-of-the-art biorefinery using only waste or residue oil. Echo Series picks up waste oil or feedstock from food factories, palm oil mills and restaurants across the region. Like this noodle restaurant kitchen in Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur, Feedstock. In this case, used cooking oil is collected, weighed. And transported to collection hubs where it's filtered and stored in silos before being transported to the biorefinery. Inside the Johor plant, old chip fat meets serious chemistry. First, the feedstock is cleaned up. Water, food particles and impurities are stripped out. Then, through a series of processes including hydro treatment and isomerization, the molecules in the oil are reengineered into hydrocarbons that have the right freezing point and structure for flying at cruising altitude, ready to be pumped directly into a plane. Echo Sirius says at maximum capacity, the plant will produce up to 420,000 tons of fuel per year, including large volumes of SAF for partner airlines. Like Cathay Pacific, Qantas and British Airways, the person driving this push, the company CEO, known as the godfather of staff, he has dedicated his career to decarbonizing travel. Well, these airlines speak Easter risk. They say that it's the climate change so. I think that we fit perfectly because we have a solution, technology solution to decarbonize. He argues that the real innovation here is not just the chemistry, but the system. Echo series wants a highly local model, short transport, distances from kitchen to plant, steady predictable supply and crucially, detailed records of where every leader of waste oil comes from. Malaysia could be the first country in the world. Who have really their shergar economy. So we are taking, you know, the feedstock those use cooking oil, some power palm waste, food waste. We bring it, you know our plant, we turn it to SF and then the KL and other big airports. In in Malaysia, but also Singapore. If that model works here, I could Series wants to replicate it in other markets. Echo Series is actively expanding its presence across Southeast Asia and already has a refinery and strong feedstock network in China. Today we have 350,000 restaurant in China which supplying to us and we know exactly which restaurant what date. The the waste is waste. All this coming. Echo Series is Malaysia plant is part of a growing network of renewable fuel projects globally, all racing to supply airlines under mounting pressure to cut emissions quickly. Industry heavyweight Nest, which has a facility across the border in Singapore, has signed agreements with Singapore Airlines and Scoot, while in the States staff production is expected to grow by 20% in 2026 thanks to many more facilities coming online. According to the US Energy Information Administration, even with the right supply, Levine says staff costs are three to five times more than conventional jet fuel. So who's paying the difference? And the feedstock is much, much more expensive than the crude oil. So the biggest thing to tackle for the future to get the cost down, it's how we could get much more feedstock that there what what we what we actually need. We've been really strategic about the way that we're picking up stuff. So we don't currently pass that cost on to our customers. We're also focused on those ports where we can get government support to be able to pick it up at a lower price. Missent says Qantas already refuels with staff at Heathrow and. LAX airports making up 1% of its fuel. Their target is to grow that to 10% by the end of the decade and 60% by 2050 if supply can keep up. We need a lot of things to go right in order to get there. It will be really difficult given the cost, but that's exactly why we're so focused on partnering with the right partners like Eco Series that brings that credibility to the supply chain, but also that has the access in the region to a significant amount of staff supply we're really focused on building. About the industry here. A circular idea and action if the model can scale. Locally sourced, fully traceable, affordable staff. Today's dirty frying oil Cleaning up, tomorrow's flying. New fuel sources, reimagining how hydrogen is used, and harnessing the sun's power. Several reasons to picture tomorrow that can be truly transformed.

Metanol merupakan salah satu komponen penting dalam pengembangan energi terbarukan di Indonesia. Metanol juga menjadi salah satu bahan baku dalam pembuatan biodiesel. Saat ini, metanol yang digunakan di dalam proses pembuatan biodiesel berasal dari gas alam. Alternatif lain yang bisa digunakan adalah metanol dari gas karbondioksida atau yang disebut metanol hijau/green methanol menghadirkan alternatif dalam upaya global untuk mengatasi krisis iklim.

Dalam proses produksi metanol hijau, menggunakan bahan baku gas CO2 dan hidrogen hijau/green hydrogen yang diproduksi dari proses elektrolisis air. Di tengah urgensi dekarbonisasi sektor industri, pendekatan inovatif ini muncul sebagai solusi yang menjanjikan, yaitu dengan menggunakan gas CO2 sebagai bahan baku dalam produksi bahan bakar cair (metanol) yang serbaguna dan ramah lingkungan.

Potensi yang besar dari pembuatan metanol dari gas karbondioksida masih menghadapai tantangan ekonomi terkait biaya capital expenditure (CAPEX) dan operational expenditure (OPEX) yang besar, kesiapan infrastruktur untuk proses penangkapan gas CO2 dari industri serta masih terbatasnya lisensor teknologi untuk produksi metanol dari CO2.

Sebuah Terobosan Berkelanjutan

Metanol konvensional yang biasanya berasal dari proses reforming gas alam atau gasifikasi batu bara, merupakan komoditas bahan kimia strategis yang digunakan dalam produksi formaldehida, plastik, tekstil, bahan bakar dan juga sebagai campuran bahan bakar fosil.

Proses produksi metanol hijau melibatkan siklus yang hampir netral karbon, di mana CO2 ditangkap dari sumber industri atau langsung dari udara. Gas CO2 kemudian dihidrogenasi menggunakan hidrogen yang dihasilkan dari elektrolisis air bertenaga energi terbarukan (seperti matahari, geotermal dan angin).

Siklus ini secara efektif akan mendaur ulang gas CO2. Ketika metanol hijau digunakan sebagai bahan bakar, akan dihasilkan CO2 yang sebelumnya sebagai bahan baku. Gas CO2 hasil dari penggunaan metanol sebagai bahan bakar dapat digunakan lagi sebagai bahan baku untuk pembuatan metanol hijau. Hal ini menjadikan metanol hijau sebagai alternatif bahan bakar fosil yang efisien dan berpotensi rendah emisi. Metanol hijau menawarkan alternatif jalur dekarbonisasi yang siap pakai.

Penggunaan metanol sebagai bahan bakar kapal laut semakin banyak dibahas dan diimplementasikan di seluruh dunia karena kemudahan penanganan, penyimpanan, dan pengangkutannya. Selain itu metanol juga dapat digunakan sebagai salah satu alternatif bahan baku pembuatan sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Tantangan Ekonomi dan Skalabilitas

Metanol hijau memiliki keunggulan terkait dengan daur ulang CO2 dan produksi dalam skala besar, seperti yang dilakukan oleh Carbon Recycling International (CRI) di Islandia. Rintangan utama pengembangan metanol hijau saat ini datang dari aspek ekonomi. Produksi metanol hijau saat ini masih jauh lebih mahal dibandingkan metanol konvensional yang berasal dari bahan bakar fosil.

Proses produksi metanol hijau yang mahal disebabkan karena biaya listrik tinggi yang berasal dari energi terbarukan (untuk pembuatan hidrogen hijau), investasi modal yang besar untuk alat elektrolisis air menjadi hidrogen dan fasilitas penangkapan gas CO2.

Menurut laporan dari International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), biaya produksi metanol terbarukan saat ini bisa lebih dari dua kali lipat harga metanol konvensional berbasis gas alam atau batubara. Untuk membuat teknologi ini menjadi kompetitif, diperlukan dukungan kebijakan fiskal yang kuat. Contohnya seperti yang terlihat dalam program RePowerEU di Eropa dan Inflation Reduction Act di Amerika Serikat, yang memberikan insentif finansial untuk energi bersih.

Dari aspek teknis, penurunan biaya teknologi elektrolisis hidrogen hijau dan penggunaan katalis untuk produksi metanol dengan konversi tinggi adalah kunci untuk mendapatkan harga produksi metanol hijau yang kompetitif. Ke depannya, harga metanol hijau yang kompetitif diharapkan dapat bersaing dengan metanol dari gas alam atau batubara.

Inovasi Katalis dan Efisiensi Proses

Perkembangan dalam teknologi katalis untuk metanol hijau, seperti penggunaan katalis berbasis alloy tembaga yang memiliki komposisi tembaga, seng oksida, dan indium oksida (atau aluminum oksida), berperan dalam meningkatkan konversi reaksi hidrogenasi CO2 menjadi metanol. Selain konversi yang tinggi, faktor kunci lain yang harus diperhatikan adalah kondisi operasi katalis pada suhu dan tekanan yang lebih rendah, yang berdampak pada turunnya biaya produksi metanol hijau.

CRI selain membangun industri metanol hijau di Islandia yang menggunakan gas CO2 dan listrik dari pembangkit listrik tenaga panas bumi juga membangun pabrik serupa dengan kapasitas lebih besar di Norwegia.

Pabrik CRI di Islandia memiliki kapasitas 5.000 ton/tahun sedangkan CRI di Norwegia berencana berproduksi dengan kapasitas 300.000 ton/tahun. Untuk CRI di Norwegia akan menggunakan energi listrik dari pembangkit listrik tenaga air dan gas CO2 berasal dari industri pengolahan logam.

Kesimpulan: Sebuah Keniscayaan Strategis

Metanol hijau memiliki peluang besar sebagai komponen penting dalam bauran energi masa depan. Metanol hijau merupakan jembatan vital untuk mendekarbonisasi sektor-sektor yang sulit dijangkau oleh elektrifikasi langsung seperti sektor maritim dan sektor penerbangan.

Jalan menuju adopsi teknologi metanol hijau memerlukan kolaborasi erat antara industri, pemerintah, dan akademisi. Penggunaan CO2 dari gas emisi menjadi bahan baku industri bernilai tinggi adalah demonstrasi nyata dari ekonomi sirkular yang berkelanjutan.

Fokus yang diperlukan saat ini adalah pada produksi metanol hijau dalam skala besar, penurunan biaya melalui inovasi (desain katalis dan desain alat elektrolis air menjadi hidrogen), kebijakan suportif dari pemerintah, dan membangun infrastruktur yang diperlukan untuk memastikan metanol hijau menjadi pilar utama dalam lanskap energi bersih global.

Analysis of government data for PA Media has revealed regional airports are among those facing the steepest increases in business rates of any sector in the UK amid an overhaul of property valuations underpinning the tax.

While London’s Heathrow and Gatwick are also being hit with huge increases in their business rates bills, the figures show that the most extreme cases are focused outside London, with regional airports poised to suffer.

Global tax firm Ryan’s calculation of Valuation Office Agency data found that the rateable values have jumped more than sixfold in some cases in the latest property revaluation, sending tax bills soaring higher.

Even with transitional relief, which limits increases to 30% next year, regional airports will still endure some of the largest cash increases in the country.

And most airports face their bills more than doubling over the next three years.

Manchester airport is among the worst affected, with its business rates bill likely to increase by £4.2m to £18.1m next year, according to Ryan’s data.

Bristol airport will receive a £1.2m increase to £5.2m, while Birmingham International airport faces a £1.8m rise to £7.6m.

Newcastle International airport is in line for a £244,755 rise to £1.1m.

Alex Probyn, the practice leader for Europe and Asia-Pacific property tax at Ryan, told PA Media: “With an unprecedented 295% sector-wide uplift, regional airports simply cannot absorb a cost shock of this magnitude.

“These increases will inevitably flow through the system: first into airport charges, then into airline costs, and ultimately into ticket prices.”

Airport operators have said the tax blow may also hold back investment in the sector.

A Manchester Airports Group spokesperson said: “Airports were already some of the highest rates-payers in the country and were prepared to pay significantly more.

“But increases of more than 100% mean we have to look again at our plans to invest more than £2bn in our airports across the UK over the next five years.

“It is inevitable air travel will become more expensive as the industry absorbs these costs. That impacts hard-working people throughout the country and makes global trade harder for businesses.”

AirportsUK – the trade group representing the sector – is working on a response to the Treasury’s consultation on the business rates plan, which closes in February.

It said the plans were “shortsighted” and would “have a knock-on effect for the businesses that depend on airport connectivity in all areas of England”.

This risks “negatively impacting local economies that depend on the supply chains, tourists and connections their airports provide”, according to the group.

“That is why the long-term review into how airport business rates are calculated, also announced by government, is so important and we will engage with Treasury to ensure this delivers the positive outcome airports need to drive investment and economic growth.”

Other regional airports heading for large bill increases include Liverpool airport with a £233,100 rise to £1m, East Midlands International airport with a £437,895 increase to £1.9m, and Bournemouth airport with a £102,398 increase to £443,723.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f5f7e68bffc435a94d547447aa39746aeae3d68/561_0_2250_1800/master/2250.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b88f88f73db334e39b9fc0fbf0c8fb07",N,,2025-12-29 03:57:24.546667

However, data covering aviation fuel supply up to October 2025 shows SAF currently makes up just 1.6% of fuel used on UK flights falling nearly 20% short of the goal.
Future SAF Targets and Industry Challenges The UK government’s policy on SAF mandates has set clear long-term targets, including the ambitious 10% SAF usage by 2030 and 22% by 2040.
The lack of infrastructure and investment in SAF production plants has also been identified as a significant barrier to scaling up production to meet future demand.
Conclusion The UK is clearly committed to reducing its aviation sector’s carbon emissions through the adoption of sustainable aviation fuels.","A new update from the UK government has revealed a potential setback in the journey to cleaner skies. According to provisional figures from the Department for Transport (DfT), the UK is on track to miss its first Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) target for 2025 raising fresh concerns about how quickly the aviation industry can decarbonise.

The policy, introduced earlier this year, requires airlines to blend a minimum amount of SAF with traditional jet fuel as part of the country’s wider climate commitments. For 2025, the target was set at 2%. However, data covering aviation fuel supply up to October 2025 shows SAF currently makes up just 1.6% of fuel used on UK flights falling nearly 20% short of the goal.

While the shortfall may seem modest on paper, it highlights the real-world challenges facing the industry, from limited SAF availability to higher costs and supply chain constraints. It also serves as an early warning, especially as targets become far more ambitious in the years ahead.

Under the government’s long-term plan, SAF usage is expected to rise sharply reaching 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. Hitting those milestones will require faster investment, stronger supply chains, and closer collaboration between government, fuel producers, and airlines.

For now, the latest figures underline a simple reality: the transition to greener aviation is underway, but it’s proving more complex and slower than hoped.

Current SAF Usage and Sources

The figures published by the Department for Transport indicate that by early October 2025, just over 160 million litres of SAF had been used across UK aviation, which is a small fraction of the total jet fuel consumed – approximately 10 billion litres. All of the SAF used in the UK so far has been derived from recycled cooking oil, primarily sourced from Asia, predominantly from China.

While the SAF being used in UK aviation does emit similar carbon dioxide levels as conventional jet fuel during flight, it is considered lower-carbon overall due to the method of production, which involves recycling waste materials rather than extracting fossil fuels. This has led to SAF being regarded as a key solution for reducing emissions in the aviation sector, especially for long-haul flights where electrification or other forms of decarbonisation remain more challenging.

Despite the early shortfall in meeting the SAF mandate, the Department for Transport (DfT) emphasized that these figures are provisional and subject to verification. The final data for the year will not be available until November 2026. Moreover, the DfT pointed out that SAF volumes are continuing to rise, and not all fuel suppliers have yet reported their SAF deliveries.

Future SAF Targets and Industry Challenges

The UK government’s policy on SAF mandates has set clear long-term targets, including the ambitious 10% SAF usage by 2030 and 22% by 2040. These targets will eventually include second-generation SAF, which is produced using more sustainable feedstocks such as agricultural waste and algae. However, second-generation SAF is not yet produced at scale, making it difficult to meet the projected targets.

Industry experts have raised concerns about the feasibility of meeting these ambitious targets, particularly with the high costs associated with second-generation SAF and the limited production capacity. The lack of infrastructure and investment in SAF production plants has also been identified as a significant barrier to scaling up production to meet future demand.

Furthermore, there are concerns over the availability of SAF supplies at airports outside of major hubs. Heathrow Airport has introduced incentives to encourage airlines to use cleaner fuels, including a reduction in landing charges for airlines that adopt SAF. Despite this, airlines operating from smaller airports, such as Gatwick and Luton, have indicated that SAF supplies remain limited, which could hinder the wider adoption of SAF across the UK.

Global Comparison and Industry Support

On the global stage, the UK remains ahead of many countries in terms of SAF uptake. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF accounted for only 0.6% of worldwide jet fuel consumption in 2025, with projections suggesting a slight increase to 0.8% in 2026. This places the UK in a relatively strong position in the global push for aviation decarbonisation. However, IATA’s director general has expressed concerns about the effectiveness of current mandates, suggesting that governments need to implement stronger incentives to stimulate SAF production and make the fuel more widely available.

The UK government has expressed continued support for the aviation sector’s decarbonisation, despite the current challenges. The aviation minister, Keir Mather, emphasized that decarbonisation efforts, including SAF adoption, would be central to the sector’s growth strategy, helping to reduce emissions while supporting future expansion. A SAF bill, currently passing through the House of Lords, is expected to guarantee prices for SAF, reducing investment risk for producers and potentially accelerating the growth of the industry.

Conclusion

The UK is clearly committed to reducing its aviation sector’s carbon emissions through the adoption of sustainable aviation fuels. However, the provisional data indicating that the first mandate target is unlikely to be met raises significant questions about the pace of this transition. With SAF being seen as one of the most viable options for decarbonising long-haul aviation, it is clear that increased investment in SAF production and infrastructure will be necessary to meet the government’s ambitious future targets. As the UK continues its push for cleaner aviation, the coming years will likely see further developments in the SAF market, with industry stakeholders and government authorities working together to overcome the current challenges.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_um1c40um1c40um1c.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 03:57:37.292538

While the region has historically been associated with large orders for new widebody aircraft, a combination of strong post-pandemic demand, constrained manufacturer supply, and the expansion of low-cost and new entrant airlines is reshaping fleet planning decisions.

Passenger traffic across the Middle East continues to rise faster than global averages, yet access to new aircraft remains limited by extended OEM backlogs. As a result, airlines are relying more heavily on leased and previously operated aircraft to sustain network expansion and protect near-term growth plans. According to forecasts from Oliver Wyman, the Middle East commercial fleet is expected to grow at around 5.1% annually through 2035, nearly double the global average, reaching approximately 2,600 aircraft. Within that growth, narrowbody aircraft are expected to play an increasingly prominent role, accounting for an estimated 47% of the regional fleet by 2035, up from around 43% today.

Against this backdrop, the secondary market has become an important mechanism for airlines to add capacity, diversify fleets, and serve thinner regional routes while longer-term delivery pipelines remain constrained.

Secondary market surge in the Gulf

Across the GCC, airlines continue to make greater use of the secondary market as they balance growth ambitions against delivery uncertainty. While large new aircraft orders remain central to long-term fleet strategies, leasing and previously operated aircraft have become a practical near-term tool for maintaining capacity and protecting network expansion.

Low-cost carriers have been particularly active. UAE-based Air Arabia, for example, has relied on a mix of leased and second-hand Airbus A320 aircraft in recent years to sustain growth while awaiting new deliveries, sourcing aircraft from major lessors including SMBC Aviation Capital, Aviation Capital Group, and BOC Aviation. This approach has allowed the group to add capacity across multiple hubs without becoming overly exposed to OEM timelines.

In Kuwait, Jazeera Airways has taken a similar stance, moving to purchase several A320ceo aircraft already operating within its fleet. The decision reflects a broader reassessment among regional carriers of the balance between leasing, ownership, and fleet age, aimed at securing capacity while managing long-term costs.

In Saudi Arabia, flynas has also adopted a pragmatic approach. Alongside its narrowbody operations, the carrier continues to operate used Airbus A330-300 aircraft and deploy wet-leased widebodies during peak Hajj and Umrah periods, underlining the role of secondary-market aircraft in meeting seasonal demand.

Taken together, these examples point to a regional shift toward flexibility. Gulf airlines are not stepping back from new aircraft programmes, but they are increasingly willing to deploy mid-life aircraft where it supports near-term capacity needs, cost control, and network resilience.

Fleet diversification with refurbished narrowbodies

Fleet diversification, particularly the growing emphasis on narrowbody aircraft, continues to underpin Gulf airlines’ use of the secondary market. As carriers seek to expand connectivity beyond primary hubs, single-aisle aircraft have become central to serving secondary cities and developing thinner regional routes.

While long-haul operators such as Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways remain anchored to widebody fleets for intercontinental networks, airlines including flydubai, Air Arabia, and Jazeera Airways operate predominantly narrowbody fleets. Advances in aircraft range and fuel efficiency, combined with lower trip costs, have enabled these carriers to open routes across the Middle East, South Asia, and parts of Africa with greater commercial flexibility.

Used and refurbished narrowbodies have played an important role in this strategy. Air Arabia built its all-Airbus fleet around second-hand A320 aircraft and continues to supplement capacity through leasing while awaiting large-scale new deliveries. flydubai has similarly relied on lease extensions, short-term ACMI arrangements, and cabin retrofit programmes to maintain capacity and product consistency across its Boeing 737-800 fleet as fleet renewal progresses.

Such strategies reflect a broader recalibration across the Gulf. Airlines are increasingly blending new aircraft orders with secondary-market lift to accelerate route development and manage risk. Industry forecasts continue to point to a rising narrowbody share in Middle East fleets over the coming decade.

Leasing platforms and policy shifts

The expanding use of the secondary market has been supported by active leasing platforms and aviation policy frameworks designed to prioritise capacity growth and market access. As delivery timelines have extended, leasing companies have taken on a more prominent role in enabling airlines to add lift outside traditional manufacturer channels.

Major lessors continue to view the Middle East as a long-term growth market, deploying both new and previously operated aircraft to meet regional demand. In 2025, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise announced a transaction valued at approximately $1 billion to acquire 17 aircraft, largely narrowbody types sourced from the secondary market. The company cited extended delivery timelines and supply constraints as key factors shaping its acquisition strategy.

In Saudi Arabia, fleet access has also been shaped by government-led initiatives under Vision 2030. Alongside the launch of Riyadh Air, the Kingdom established a state-backed leasing platform, AviLease, to support domestic and regional fleet growth. The placement of Riyadh Air’s first Boeing 787-9 through AviLease illustrates how new leasing vehicles are being used to accelerate access to aircraft and reduce exposure to global supply constraints.

More broadly, aviation policy across the Gulf continues to emphasise market expansion and competition. Saudi Arabia’s General Authority of Civil Aviation has outlined plans to increase annual passenger capacity to 330 million by 2030, while the UAE and other GCC states have supported the growth of low-cost carriers as part of broader connectivity strategies.

In this environment, leasing companies and government-backed platforms have become important mechanisms for securing aircraft when immediate availability is required. Used and mid-life aircraft, which can be deployed more quickly than new deliveries, have therefore assumed a more visible role within fleet planning.

New entrants, OEM backlogs, and competitive pressure

Ongoing aircraft delivery constraints, combined with the entry of new airlines and sustained capacity growth across the Gulf, continue to shape fleet decision-making. While some supply chain pressures have eased, OEM backlogs remain extended, limiting airlines’ ability to rely solely on new deliveries to support near-term expansion.

The emergence of new competitors, most notably Riyadh Air, alongside continued growth in low-cost carriers, has intensified competitive dynamics across both regional and long-haul markets. For incumbent airlines, the challenge is not only long-term fleet renewal, but maintaining network relevance and frequency in an environment where market share can be lost quickly if capacity additions lag demand.

As a result, many Gulf airlines continue to supplement long-term order books with leased and previously operated aircraft to sustain growth and protect schedules. In Saudi Arabia, flynas supported its initial long-haul expansion by deploying used Airbus A330 aircraft and wet-leased capacity, enabling the airline to enter new markets without waiting for factory-new widebodies.

At the full-service end of the market, fleet constraints have prompted similar reassessments. Emirates, facing continued delays to the Boeing 777X programme, has extended the operational life of its Airbus A380 fleet well into the next decade, including the acquisition of additional mid-life aircraft to secure capacity and control costs.

These developments underscore how competitive positioning in the Gulf is increasingly shaped by near-term access to aircraft. Leasing and secondary-market acquisitions have become tools for managing timing risk rather than signals of long-term fleet direction.

Sustainability and the road ahead

The increased use of used and mid-life aircraft has introduced a more nuanced sustainability discussion within Gulf fleet planning. While long-term decarbonisation strategies remain anchored in next-generation aircraft and fuel technologies, near-term capacity constraints have required airlines to balance environmental objectives with operational realities.

Extending the service life of existing aircraft can, in certain respects, be resource-efficient, deferring the environmental costs associated with manufacturing replacement aircraft. As a result, several carriers have invested in refurbishment and retrofit programmes to improve efficiency and the passenger experience on older platforms. Emirates has committed to multi-year retrofit programmes for its Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 fleets, while flydubai has upgraded the interiors of its Boeing 737-800 aircraft as part of its transition strategy.

At the same time, airlines recognise that older aircraft cannot match the emissions performance of new-generation models such as the Airbus A321neo or Boeing 737 MAX. Gulf carriers, therefore, continue to view the use of older aircraft as transitional rather than structural, combining interim fleet measures with sustainable aviation fuel initiatives, operational efficiencies, and incremental investment in new aircraft types.

Across the region, governments and airlines remain aligned with mid-century net-zero ambitions. In this context, reliance on secondary-market aircraft is best understood as part of a phased adjustment, supporting growth through the latter half of the 2020s while fleet modernisation and fuel innovation progressively reduce emissions intensity into the 2030s.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/12/29/Riyadh-Air_livery-belly-and-front_PriestmanGoode.jpeg,N,,2025-12-29 03:57:47.046285

The Union minister, however, said bureaucratic delays and excessive permissions often slow down projects. ""This must be overcome to make India energy self-reliant,"" he said while asking Haryana City Gas (HCG), which has bagged the licence for supplying piped natural gas in Nagpur district, to prepare a two-year execution plan for expanding the network in Nagpur, as opposed to the company's eight-year plan. ""Eight years is too long. If we can build 10 national highways across the country in that time, why can't this project be completed in two years?"" Gadkari said, assuring officials of full support to fast-track approvals and clear bottlenecks. HCG will get the piped natural gas (PNG) from Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) which operationalised its Mumbai-Nagpur pipeline running along the Samruddhi expressway. Gadkari was speaking at the function in Nagpur organised by HCG, to mark the start of piped CNG distribution in the district. Gadkari also said at present, natural gas is available in some parts of the country, especially in Assam and Andhra Pradesh. ""Large quantities of natural gas is also found in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. It will certainly help India's economy,"" said Gadkari, adding that Tadoba forest (Chandrapur district) also has natural gas and forest department permission is not needed for it. He spoke at length about alternative fuels such as CNG, LNG, bio-CNG, ethanol, methanol, electric mobility, and green hydrogen, saying these options benefit both consumers and farmers. He underlined that farmers should evolve from being just ""food providers"" to becoming energy, fuel, bitumen, and even aviation fuel providers. He stressed that even if we manage to save Rs10 lakh crore and invest it in the rural agricultural economy, smart villages could be developed. The Nagpur MP added that rice is the major agricultural crop in Bhandara, Gondia, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, and part of Nagpur district in Vidarbha. ""Rice straw is abundantly available here. In Panipat, we have started a plant, which is a dream project of mine. From about 150 tonnes of rice straw per day, it produces around one lakh litres of bio-ethanol per day, bio-bitumen, and nearly 78,000 tonnes per year of sustainable aviation fuel. Even aircraft can now run on this fuel,"" said Gadkari. ""The country imports nearly 87% of its energy, costing over Rs23 lakh crore annually. This is not just an economic problem but also a major cause of air pollution. Import substitution, cost-effectiveness, pollution-free solutions, and indigenous technology are the govt's priorities,"" Gadkari said, adding that Delhi's pollution is so bad that it is hard to live there. ""Hydrogen is also being introduced in construction and agricultural equipment. As transport minister, I have clearly told manufacturers to move away from diesel and petrol, otherwise stringent Euro-6 emission norms will be enforced. As a result, tractors with flex engines running on 100% ethanol and CNG have already been developed,"" said Gadkari.

The question is whether we keep waiting for conventional approaches to deliver, or back technologies built for the reality we face.","Britain's first year of SAF mandate compliance is drawing to a close. The early data is instructive. The DfT's provisional figures show SAF at 1.6% of UK jet fuel supply through early October; against a 2% requirement. A 20% shortfall. More revealing than the percentage is the composition: 🔹 All SAF supplied came from HEFA 🔹 All feedstock was used cooking oil 🔹 All sourced from Asia, predominantly China 🔹 No gasification, alcohol-to-jet, or power-to-liquid Let's be clear: HEFA dominance in year one is not surprising. It's the only commercially viable pathway at scale. The mandate itself permits 100% HEFA contribution through 2026. But that allowance exists because policymakers expected alternatives to be developing in parallel. The HEFA cap drops to 71% by 2030. Power-to-liquid becomes mandatory from 2028. Where is the pipeline to meet those requirements? IATA's director general describes global SAF production as ""stalling."" The UK industry remains ""confident."" Both cannot be right. Mandates create demand. They do not create supply. And supply chains built on a single imported feedstock are not resilient, they are exposed. This is why investment in emerging technologies matters now. At Avena Fuels, we are developing modular solutions that dramatically reduce CapEx, deploy in months rather than years, and work with regionally available feedstocks; building the diversified capacity the mandate will soon demand. The targets are escalating. The question is whether we keep waiting for conventional approaches to deliver, or back technologies built for the reality we face. https://lnkd.in/egXgZ_PM",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/sync/v2/D4D27AQHxxKLEficGZQ/articleshare-shrink_800/B4DZtZRzOqIYAI-/0/1766729397474?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Uq4vh4nyInwqmcJcvI2xorNo37pRbFAg2hmckJk6p7U,N,,2025-12-28 18:56:37.860503

However, one year on, there is greater promise around the expansion of the SAF industry, as several countries begin to develop their SAF industries.
In December 2024, the IATA reported that SAF volumes had doubled to 1 million tonnes, compared to 0.5 million tonnes in 2023.
However, it contributed just 0.3% of global jet fuel production, suggesting that much more needs to be done to decarbonise the aviation sector.
At this point, the IATA anticipated SAF production would grow to 2.1 million tonnes in 2025.","At the end of 2024, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported that there had been disappointingly slow growth in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sector. However, one year on, there is greater promise around the expansion of the SAF industry, as several countries begin to develop their SAF industries.

SAF is an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum feedstocks that reduces emissions from air transportation. SAF can be blended at different levels with limits between 10 percent and 50 percent, depending on the feedstock and how the fuel is produced. According to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), over 360,000 commercial flights have used SAF at 46 different airports, largely concentrated in the United States and Europe.

In December 2024, the IATA reported that SAF volumes had doubled to 1 million tonnes, compared to 0.5 million tonnes in 2023. However, it contributed just 0.3% of global jet fuel production, suggesting that much more needs to be done to decarbonise the aviation sector. Previous SAF production estimates put output at 1.5 million tonnes for 2024, but several delays at new facilities led companies to fall short on predictions. At this point, the IATA anticipated SAF production would grow to 2.1 million tonnes in 2025.

""SAF volumes are increasing, but disappointingly slowly. Governments are sending mixed signals to oil companies, which continue to receive subsidies for their exploration and production of fossil oil and gas. And investors in new generation fuel producers seem to be waiting for guarantees of easy money before going full throttle,"" said the IATA's Director General, Willie Walsh.

In October, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) published its first ReFuelEU Aviation Annual Technical Report, outlining the achievements being seen in the SAF sector. EASA found that the EU is on track to meet the compulsory SAF blend of 6 percent by 2030, even though the technology is still in an early stage in the EU. The research showed that 25 fuel suppliers provided SAF to 33 EU airports across 12 EU Member States.

In 2025, the EU and the U.K. imposed a mandate requiring 2 percent of jet fuel to be sustainable. This figure rises to 6 percent in the EU and 10 percent in the U.K. by 2030. However, some airlines are concerned about the lack of availability of SAF and the high cost of the fuel. The CEO of low-cost airline Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, has dismissed the need to shift to SAF. ""It is all gradually dying a death, which is what it deserves to do. We have just about met our 2 percent mandate. There is no possibility of meeting 6 percent by 2030; 10 percent, not a hope in hell. We're not going to get to net zero by 2050,"" said O'Leary.

Meanwhile, the IATA's Willie Walsh suggested that a 5 percent target by 2030 might be more realistic. Walsh stated in October that he was disappointed with progress in the SAF industry and does ""not believe that target can be achieved given where we are in terms of SAF production"". He also said that there was a clear case for SAF, ""We now need to turn what we know is technically possible into something that's commercially possible and commercially viable for the industry.""

However, the U.K. is hopeful about the potential for SAF production, with the Department for Transport allocating $84.2 million to 17 companies looking to produce SAF in the U.K. in July.

Meanwhile, we are seeing significant SAF production expansion in new markets, including India, Argentina, and Indonesia. India Oil's Panipat refinery was recently certified to produce SAF from cooking oil, making it the first plant in the country with this capability. Indian Oil will use abundant waste feedstocks to produce SAF.

In Argentina, the state-owned oil company YPF announced plans to invest $400 million in its joint venture Santa Fe Bio, where it will produce SAF from agricultural residues and waste oils. This is expected to help establish the South American country as a regional SAF hub in the coming years.

In Indonesia, Pertamina has delivered its first SAF shipment, produced at its Cilacap refinery, to Soekarno-Hatta Airport. The firm is using a mix of waste cooking oil and conventional jet fuel to produce SAF, with a production capacity of 1,400 kilolitres a day. It hopes to deliver 1.7 million litres to Jakarta this year.

However, some SAF projects in more conventional production hubs, such as the United States, have faltered. Several companies have been forced to delay production or halt operations due to a plethora of challenges, such as high costs and a lack of industry commitment to SAF. ""Some airlines were engaged in a pretty disingenuous effort to put out press releases"" overstating their commitment to SAF projects, said World Energy's CEO Gene Gebolys. ""People sometimes said too much in the past and did too little.""

While new SAF-producing powers are beginning to emerge in unexpected parts of the world, other, more traditional SAF producers are falling behind on their targets. To increase SAF production on a global scale, the aviation industry must follow through on its commitment to decarbonise, which could be supported through stricter government mandates with clear SAF blend targets.

This tax is strikingly similar to France’s “solidarity” tax on private aviation, which has faced similar criticism from industry stakeholders.
The new Dutch air travel tax is expected to have a considerable impact on the cost structures of private air charter companies operating in the Netherlands, particularly those offering short to medium-distance flights.
The European Business Aviation Association (EBAA) has noted that elevated taxes on business aviation are becoming more widespread in Europe.
With the Dutch air travel tax set to take effect in 2030, the private air charter industry faces significant challenges.","The Netherlands has announced a significant new tax affecting private air charter flights, set to take effect on January 1, 2030. This move, confirmed by the Dutch Senate on December 16, will impose a per-passenger tax on aircraft with fewer than 19 seats. The Dutch air travel tax has drawn strong reactions from both the European Business Aviation Association (EBAA) and local industry groups, who are now pushing for the new regulation to be overturned before its implementation.

A Significant Financial Impact on Private Air Charter Operators

Under the new legislation, per-passenger rates will range from €420 ($488) for flights covering distances of up to 2,000 km (1,087 nm), with rates climbing to €2,100 for flights exceeding 5,500 km. This tax is strikingly similar to France’s “solidarity” tax on private aviation, which has faced similar criticism from industry stakeholders. The new Dutch air travel tax is expected to have a considerable impact on the cost structures of private air charter companies operating in the Netherlands, particularly those offering short to medium-distance flights.

This tax change is not an isolated case. The European Business Aviation Association (EBAA) has noted that elevated taxes on business aviation are becoming more widespread in Europe. Similar tax measures are being proposed in the United Kingdom and Spain, all of which stem from the broader goals of the European Green Deal, which seeks to reduce carbon emissions from the aviation sector.

EBAA’s Opposition to the New Dutch Air Travel Tax

The European Business Aviation Association (EBAA), which represents the interests of private aviation operators across Europe, has expressed strong opposition to the Dutch air travel tax. According to EBAA’s Director for Public Affairs and Communications, Róman Kok, many Dutch lawmakers who voted for the tax are now acknowledging that they did not fully understand the negative impact the tax would have on domestic operators. Kok highlighted that the tax could inadvertently benefit foreign companies that are not subject to the same fiscal reporting requirements as Dutch-based charter operators, thereby putting local businesses at a competitive disadvantage.

The EBAA’s concerns echo the findings of research conducted by EBAA France, which shows that France’s similar tax has led to a shift in flight operations. While the overall volume of flights has remained stable, more of these flights are now being operated by foreign companies, which are not burdened by the same tax obligations. This trend has prompted EBAA to call for a reduction in the French tax as part of the country’s 2026 budget review.

The Green Deal Legacy: More Challenges for Business Aviation

The introduction of the Dutch air travel tax is just one example of the broader regulatory challenges facing the European aviation industry. The European Green Deal and accompanying policies, such as the ReFuel EU initiative, are placing additional pressure on business aviation. These policies aim to increase the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) across the sector, but they have raised concerns within the business aviation community.

EBAA CEO Stefan Benz has stated that while the association supports the use of SAF, it remains critical of the way these policies are being implemented. Benz pointed out that many of these measures are unworkable for small, non-scheduled operators, who face operational difficulties that larger carriers do not. EBAA has made it clear that it will continue to lobby for reforms to these policies, aiming to make them more practical for private air charter companies.

Potential Impact on European Airports and Flight Planning

The EBAA is also concerned about potential changes to regulations governing slot allocations at European airports. As the European Commission reviews rules related to slot-constrained airports, there is a growing fear that new guidelines could place business aviation operators at a disadvantage when it comes to gaining access to busy airports. This could lead to even greater financial pressures for private air charter companies operating in Europe.

Furthermore, the EBAA has raised alarms about the potential for excessive restrictions on flight planning due to environmental considerations. Although Article 20 of the EU’s Air Service Regulation already allows member states to impose restrictions on air travel, there is growing pressure to make these restrictions easier to enforce. The impact of these potential changes could make flight planning more complicated and costly for private air charter operators, adding another layer of challenges to an already difficult operating environment.

The Role of EBAA in Advocacy and Reform

As the voice of business aviation in Europe, the European Business Aviation Association (EBAA) plays a critical role in advocating for industry interests. The organization has been actively lobbying against the Dutch air travel tax and other similar measures, working closely with its members and stakeholders to push for reforms.

EBAA has also been engaging with European policymakers to address issues surrounding the use of SAF, fuel tankering restrictions and slot allocation rules. Benz emphasized that the association is making progress in its lobbying efforts, with growing support from EBAA members who are keen to directly influence European aviation policies. This year, EBAA organized a successful campaign where 348 individuals sent letters to the European Commission, urging action on key issues affecting the business aviation sector.

What’s Next for the Industry?

With the Dutch air travel tax set to take effect in 2030, the private air charter industry faces significant challenges. While the EBAA continues to oppose the tax, the future of this measure remains uncertain. If the new coalition government in the Netherlands decides to reconsider the tax, it could provide some relief for local charter operators. However, EBAA will continue to fight for industry reforms, including tax reductions and more flexible SAF policies, to ensure the long-term sustainability of the business aviation sector in Europe.

The situation in the Netherlands highlights the ongoing struggles of the business aviation industry as it adapts to the evolving regulatory landscape. As new policies are implemented across Europe, private air charter operators will need to remain vigilant and engaged in lobbying efforts to protect their interests.

In conclusion, the introduction of the Dutch private air charter tax represents a critical development for the business aviation sector and the EBAA will continue to lead efforts to reform these measures in the interest of industry stakeholders. With advocacy, collaboration and a commitment to addressing operational challenges, the European business aviation community aims to navigate these turbulent skies.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Netherlands-5.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 13:56:36.181689
,,2025-12-28 17:55:34+00:00,Farm Forum,Focus on Ag: Key Ag policy issues ahead in 2026 - Farm Forum,Kent Thiesse,,,,,https://www.farmforum.net/story/news/columnists/2025/12/28/focus-on-ag-key-ag-policy-issues-ahead-in-2026/87935534007/,"As we look ahead to 2026, there are many key issues and possible policy initiatives that could potentially affect the agriculture industry.
Canada, Mexico, and China are the three largest trading partners for U.S. ag exports, including corn, soybeans, ethanol, pork, beef, and dairy products.
This included enhancements to the reference prices and crop insurance provisions that would normally be addressed in a Farm Bill.
However, the OBBA did not address other Farm Bill Titles such as Conservation, Rural Development, Ag Research, or Trade Promotion.
These are only a few of the potential ag policy issues that could affect farm families and rural businesses in 2026.","We have nearly completed the first year of the second Trump Administration, as well as having new leadership in the U.S. Senate, along with some changes in lead roles on the Congressional Agriculture Committees. In 2025, we saw the passage of a large reconciliation bill, the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill”, the initiation of several ad-hoc farm program payments, and the lengthy shutdown of the federal government in October and early November. We also had several actions implemented by the Trump Administration in 2025 that had an impact on farmers and the agriculture industry. As we look ahead to 2026, there are many key issues and possible policy initiatives that could potentially affect the agriculture industry. There is not total agreement among ag leaders and members of Congress regarding some of the policy initiatives that are being considered. The leadership of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, as well as key Congressional Committees such as the House and Senate Agriculture Committees, will have a major influence on future agriculture and energy issues. Republican Senator John Thune from South Dakota, who has strong ties to agriculture and energy policy, is the current leader of the U.S. Senate. Arkansas Senator John Bozeman is the Chair of the U.S. Senate Ag Committee, and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar is in the Democratic leadership role as the Ranking Member on the Ag Committee. Republican Congressman G.T. Thompson from Georgia will continue the Chair the U.S. House Agriculture committee, and Minnesota Second District Congresswoman Angie Craig will likely continue as the lead Democrat on the Ag Committee. There are many other Senators and members of the U.S. House from the Upper Midwest that are seated on key Congressional committees that have an impact on the ag industry. Following is some perspective on a few of the key agriculture and energy policy issues that may be under consideration during the next session of Congress, or by executive action from the Administration: · Tariffs and Trade Policy --- During the first year of his second term, President Trump has shown the willingness to impose large additional tariffs on a variety of goods being imported into the United States from China, Mexico, Canada, and other countries. The administration later eased up on some of those tariffs, especially on certain goods and services used by the ag industry; however, the cost of many farm inputs and expenses increased in 2025 due to impacts that resulted from the added tariffs. Canada, Mexico, and China are the three largest trading partners for U.S. ag exports, including corn, soybeans, ethanol, pork, beef, and dairy products. The “United Staes-Mexico-Canada” (USMCA) trade agreement negotiated during the first Trump administration will be up for renewal in 2026. Farm groups and ag leaders are also hopeful that the administration can negotiate new trade agreements with other countries, in addition to the China trade deal that was negotiated this past Fall. Expanding U.S. exports is seen as a key component to improving farm profitability for many ag commodities. · Renewable Fuels and Energy --- Many farm organizations are hoping that the Trump administration and Congress will take a stronger stance on further development of the renewable energy industry in the U.S. through implementation of year-round E-15 fuel blends, development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other incentives for renewable fuels. Ethanol and renewable diesel production have a major economic impact for farm operators, as well as for the overall rural economy in the Upper Midwest. Many ag leaders point to the development of SAF as a key growth opportunity for both the ethanol and renewable diesel industries in the future. However, the federal government has been somewhat slow to develop policies, as well as to provide the research and development funding, for the production of SAF fuel. U.S. farmers and the renewable fuel processing plants have remained somewhat confused regarding the policy direction for SAF fuel, along with the research and development of SAF fuel, as well as the overall future for the renewable energy industry in the U.S.2 / 2· Farm and Rural Economy struggles continue --- Profit margins from crop production for many farmers were negative for the third year in a row in 2025, and profit prospects do not appear to be much better for 2026. The continued long-term weak farm profitability could put some farm operations on the brink of financial disaster. Crop production input costs and other farm expenses are expected increase in 2026, while land rental rates are expected to stay at fairly high levels in the coming year. Crop prices for corn, soybeans and wheat have remained below breakeven levels, and remain the lowest levels in the several years. For farm operators that experienced crop losses in either 2024 or 2025 due to weather issues, the financial situation is likely even more severe. Farmers have become quite dependent on short-term ad hoc government payments to offset the negative profit margins. During 2025, most crop producers received Economic Commodity Assistance Program (ECAP) payments, and some farmers also received Supplemental Disaster Relief Program (SDRP) payments for 2024 crop yield losses. Looking ahead to 2026, most crop producers will be receiving the recently announced Farmer Bridge Assistance (FBA) payments in late February, and there will likely be a “top-off” SDRP payment for 2023 and 2024 crop yield losses. There has been no announcement of any disaster assistance for 2025 crop yield reductions.· Implementation of the “One Big Beautiful Act” (OBBA) --- The so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” that Congress passed in 2025 contained many provisions that will improve the “safety net” for many Midwest crop producers, which began with the 2025 crop year. This included enhancements to the reference prices and crop insurance provisions that would normally be addressed in a Farm Bill. Most of the farm “safety net” provisions that were updated in the OBBA have been in place since the 2014 Farm Bill was enacted, and were continued through the 2024 year. The 2018 Farm Bill originally expired on September 30, 2023, and was extended las Fall for a second year in a row, with a new expiration date of September 30, 2026. In addition to the improvements in some crop “safety net” provisions, the OBBA also made some adjustments to the Nutrition Title of the Farm Bill (SNAP program, etc.). However, the OBBA did not address other Farm Bill Titles such as Conservation, Rural Development, Ag Research, or Trade Promotion. · Immigration Policies --- Both production agriculture and the ag processing industry rely heavily on immigrant labor to maintain an adequate workforce, so actions in many parts of the U.S. by the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has put some segments of the industry on edge in many communities. In the meantime, there has been very little action by either Congress or the Administration to address the workforce shortage that exists in portions of the agriculture industry. What is really needed is the development of an immigration policy that both secures the U.S. border and also allows needed immigration to satisfy labor shortages in some segments of the ag industry. · Implications of “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) --- U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Robert F. Kennedy, stirred some concern during 2025 with some potential proposals that were in the initial MAHA reports. While many of the recommendations in the report related to the agriculture industry were delayed, many farm and ag industry leaders are wondering what the impacts of MAHA might be in 2026 and beyond. Some of these recommendations could have a major impact on future farm production practices, as well as on the ag processing industry. These are only a few of the potential ag policy issues that could affect farm families and rural businesses in 2026. There are also issues such as family health care access and costs, infrastructure needs in rural areas, assistance for beginning farmers, and other issues affecting rural Families and communities. It will be interesting if Congress or the Administration addresses any of these issues in the coming year, which will feature the important nationwide Midterm Elections in November, 2026.",https://www.farmforum.net/gcdn/-mm-/86b682f88a0138fa795d7d7d2178d61316e56bc0/c=0-272-650-638/local/-/media/2021/10/05/FarmForum/536e1542b37391083b4445cc493b401b.jpg?width=650&height=366&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp,N,,2025-12-28 13:56:40.721248

The latest episode examines the diverse innovations driving a cleaner future – from making the aviation industry greener through sustainable jet fuel to advancing solar efficiency and developing revolutionary hydrogen power solutions.

Tomorrow Transformed travels to Sydney, Australia, to explore the global energy revolution being led by the University of New South Wales (UNSW). Known as a ""hotbed of innovation"" in photovoltaics, the institution is home to Professor Martin Green, the ""father of solar energy,"" whose PERC Cell design is used in over 90% of solar cells installed worldwide. At UNSW, Professor Ned Ekins-Daukes and PhD student Jamie Harrison are demonstrating how thermodynamics can be used to harvest energy as heat leaves the earth's surface for the cold sky. While solar now provides the cheapest energy in history, researchers are pushing further to eliminate manufacturing bottlenecks. Vince Allen, co-founder of the startup SunDrive, is pioneering a shift away from expensive and rare silver in solar cell production, replacing it with copper - a material that is 1000 times more abundant and 100 times cheaper.

The journey continues to Cape Town, South Africa, where HYENA (Hydrogen Energy Applications) is reimagining how the world's most abundant element can provide reliable power to the African continent. CNN speaks with HYENA co-founder Jack Fletcher to explore how their ""Power Pod"" technology uses hydrogen to offer a quieter, more efficient, and significantly cleaner alternative to traditional diesel generators. By converting available fuels like LPG into electricity via a chemical process rather than combustion, the system drastically reduces emissions and eliminates the noise of a standard engine.

Located at the Sines refinery, the complex will produce renewable diesel (HVO) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), two alternatives with a lower climate impact than traditional fossil fuels.

What will these fuels be made from?

The new biofuel plant will use used cooking oils, animal fats and other biological waste as feedstocks, combined with green hydrogen generated at Galp’s H₂ Park. This synergy will make it possible to transform waste into energy, within a circular and low-carbon economy model.

From an environmental standpoint, the project will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 88%, and will prevent the discharge of approximately 800 thousand tons of CO₂ per year. In addition, water use will be minimized through the reuse of rain and treated water along with actions to preserve local species such as the Cabrera rat.

Million-dollar investment with impact on employment and local development

With an investment of 400 million euros, the HVO@Galp project will generate up to 1,050 jobs during its construction phase. Once operational, it is estimated that between 226 and 276 direct and indirect jobs will be created.

The complex will be integrated into the existing infrastructure of the Sines refinery and on land in the Sines Industrial and Logistics Zone (ZILS), covering more than nine hectares and three operational areas: feedstock pretreatment, production unit and auxiliary systems.

Biofuels ready for today’s transportation

One of the strengths of the project is that the fuels produced will be fully compatible with current infrastructure and engines, both in road transport and aviation. This will enable progress to be made in decarbonization without the need to renew the vehicle fleet or build new distribution networks.

In addition to HVO and SAF, the plant will produce bionaphtha, biopropane and renewable gas, expanding the portfolio of clean energies available in Portugal and contributing to meeting the objectives of the PNEC 2030, the RED II directive and the RNC 2050 strategy.",https://cdn.inspenet.com/planta-biocombustibles-galp-sines-2026.webp,N,,2025-12-28 13:56:44.322525

Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer.","This story is from Floodlight, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates the powers stalling climate action. Sign up for Floodlight’s newsletter here.

For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90 million acres — about the size of Montana — and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline.

But a growing body of research reveals that America’s obsession with corn has a steep price: The fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.

Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it.

Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when that nitrogen breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.

Agriculture accounts for more than 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide — making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.

The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol — which now consumes more than 40 percent of the U.S. corn crop — is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.

Since 2000, U.S. corn production has surged almost 50 percent, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.

Yet the environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy — and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it.

The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it.

Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn,” demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions.

At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50 billion in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.

Researchers say proven conservation steps — such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in cornfields — could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices.

Experts say it all raises a larger question: If America’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it a different way?

How corn took over America

Corn has been a staple of U.S. agriculture for centuries, first domesticated by Native Americans and later used by European immigrants as a versatile crop for food and animal feed. Its production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of America’s corn crop into ethanol.

Corn’s dominance — and the emissions that come with it — didn’t happen by accident. It was built through a high-dollar lobbying campaign that continues today.

In the late 1990s, America’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom.”

In 2001 and 2002, the federal government gave corn farmers and ethanol producers a boost — first through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bioenergy Program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 Farm Bill created programs that continue to support ethanol and other renewable energy.

Corn growers soon after mounted an all-out campaign in Washington. Their goal: persuade Congress to require gasoline to be blended with ethanol. State and national grower groups lobbied relentlessly, pitching ethanol as a way to cut greenhouse gasses, reduce oil dependence and revive rural economies.

“We got down to a couple of votes in Congress, and the corn growers were united like never before,” recalled Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying, ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you.’ I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”

Their persistence paid off. In 2005, Congress created the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that a certain amount of ethanol be blended into U.S. gasoline each year. Two years later, lawmakers expanded it further. The policy transformed the market: The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.

When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, is that more land around the world got cleared to grow corn. That, in turn, resulted in more emissions.

That lobbying brought clout. “King Corn” became a political force, courted by presidential hopefuls and protected by both parties. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55 million on lobbying and millions more on political donations, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight.

In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Major industry players — Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Cargill and ethanol giant POET among them — have poured even more into Washington, ensuring the sector’s voice remains one of the loudest in U.S. agriculture.

Now those same groups are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.

Research undercuts ethanol’s clean-fuel claims

Corn and ethanol trade groups didn’t make their officials available for interviews.

But on their websites and in their literature, they have promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel.

The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40-50 percent compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong — and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.

“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.

Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement to Floodlight that U.S. farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial,” using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint.

“Biofuel producers are making investments today that will make their products net-zero or even net negative in the next two decades,” the statement said.

But some research tells a different story.

A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the Midwest — with the same fields planted in corn year after year — carries a heavy climate cost.

Research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to expanded corn cultivation, heavier fertilizer use, worsening water pollution and increased emissions. Scientists typically convert greenhouse gasses like nitrous oxide and methane into their carbon-dioxide equivalents — or carbon intensity — so their warming impacts can be compared on the same scale.

“The carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher,” the authors concluded.

Lark’s research has been disputed by scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University and the University of Illinois, who published a formal rebuttal arguing the study relied on “questionable assumptions” and faulty modeling — a charge Lark’s team has rejected.

A 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the RFS was unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas goals because the U.S. relies predominantly on corn ethanol and produces relatively little of the cleaner, advanced biofuels made from waste.

The problem isn’t just emissions, researchers say. Corn ethanol requires millions of acres that could instead be used for food crops or more efficient energy sources. One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3 percent of the land.

“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can't solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”

Most of the country’s top crop isn’t feeding people. More than 40 percent of U.S. corn goes to ethanol. A similar amount is used to feed livestock, and just 12 percent ends up as food or in other uses.

As corn production rises, so have emissions

Globally, corn production doubled from 2000 to 2021.

That growth has been fueled by fertilizer, which emits nitrous oxide that can linger in the atmosphere for more than a century. That eats away at the ozone layer, which blocks most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.

Global emissions have soared alongside corn production. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrous oxide emissions from human activity climbed 40 percent, the Global Carbon project found.

In the United States, nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture in 2022 were equal to roughly 262 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. That’s equivalent to putting almost 56 million passenger cars on the road.

The biggest increases are coming straight from the Corn Belt.

Ethanol’s climate footprint isn’t the only concern. The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution.

According to a new report by the Alliance for the Great Lakes and Clean Wisconsin, more than 90 percent of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources — mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure.

The same analysis estimates that in 2022, farmers applied more than 16 million pounds of nitrogen beyond what crops needed, sending runoff into wells, streams and other water systems.

For families like Tyler Frye’s, that hits close to home. In 2022, Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles east of Green Bay. A free test soon afterward found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” he said.

Frye installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.

One likely culprit, he suspects, are the cornfields less than 200 yards from his home.

“Crops like corn require a lot of nitrogen,” he said. “A lot of that stuff, I assume, is getting into the well water and surface water.”

When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”

What cleaner corn could look like

Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible — but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, strips out the provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that had rewarded farmers for climate-friendly practices.

And in April, Trump’s USDA canceled the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative, a grant program designed to promote farming and forestry practices to improve soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agency said that the program’s administrative costs meant too little money was reaching farmers, while Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins dismissed it as part of the “green new scam.”

University of Iowa professor Silvia Secchi said the rollback of the Climate-Smart program has already given farmers “cold feet” about adopting conservation practices. “The impact of this has been devastating,” said Secchi, a natural resources economist who teaches at the university’s School of Earth, Environment and Sustainability.

Research shows what’s possible if farmers had support. In its recent report, the Environmental Working Group found that four proven conservation practices — including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in cornfields — could make a measurable difference.

Implementing those practices on just 4 percent of continuous corn acres across Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin would cut total greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking more than 850,000 gasoline cars off the road, EWG found.

Despite setbacks at the federal level, some farmers are already showing what a more climate-friendly Corn Belt could look like.

In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson farms 1,200 acres of corn and soybeans with her father. On 130 of those acres, she’s trying something different: She’s planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer.

“The more perennials we can have on the ground, the better it is for the climate,” she said.

Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They’ve also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” — bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer.

Under the now-canceled Climate-Smart grant program, they were supposed to receive technical assistance and about $20,000 a year to expand those practices. The grant program was terminated before they got any of the money.

“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps. Because agriculture is a high-risk occupation.”

The economics still favor business as usual. Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer.

“I think a lot of farmers around here are very allergic to trees,” she joked.

In southeast Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle, who mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres, uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller-crimping — flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs.

“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” he said.

But farmers get few government incentives to take such climate-friendly steps, Lyle said. “There is a lack of seriousness about supporting farmers to implement these new practices,” he said.

And without federal programs to offset the risk, the innovations that Lyle and Johnson are trying remain exceptions — not the norm.

Many farmers still see prairie strips or patches of trees as a waste, said Luke Gran, whose company helps Iowa farmers establish perennials.

“My eyes do not lie,” Gran said. “I have not seen extensive change to cover cropping or tillage across the broad acreage of this state that I love.”

The next corn boom?

Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for policies to boost ethanol demand.

One big priority: Pushing a bill to require that new cars are able to run on gas with more ethanol than what’s commonly sold today.

Corn and biofuel trade groups have also been pressing Democrats and Republicans in Congress for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel. While use of such “sustainable” aviation fuel still is in its early stages domestically, corn and biofuel associations have made developing a market for it a top policy priority.

Secchi, the Iowa professor, says it’s easy to see why ethanol producers are trying to expand their market: The growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.

Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based jet fuel could trigger major land-use shifts. A 2024 World Resources Institute analysis found that meeting the federal goal of 35 billion gallons of ethanol jet fuel would require about 114 million acres of corn — roughly 20 percent more corn acreage than the U.S. already plants for all purposes. That surge in demand, the authors concluded, would push up food prices and worsen hunger.

Secchi calls that scenario a climate and land-use “disaster.” Large-scale use of ethanol-based aviation fuel, she said, would mean clearing even more land and pouring on even more nitrogen fertilizer, driving up greenhouse gas emissions.

“The result,” she said, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”",https://imengine.public.prod.cdr.navigacloud.com?uuid=b10fa10b-3e95-57ea-9eb9-93aa64414521&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=60&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.78612&width=1200&height=630&x=1.0E-5&y=0.19325,N,,2025-12-28 07:11:41.158576

On December 28, reports highlight wider use by Emirates, Lufthansa, and British Airways, pointing to strong long-haul demand and tighter capacity on key routes. For German investors, this signals higher wide-body utilization, fuller premium cabins, and more airport throughput. While A380 production is closed, services, maintenance, and cabin upgrades are rising. We explain how the airbus a380 revival affects airline capacity planning, airport revenues, and aviation suppliers in Germany.

A380 revival: signals for Germany

Germany’s largest airports have limited peak slots, so the airbus a380 helps add seats without more movements. Frankfurt and Munich can feed dense flows to North America, the Gulf, and Asia on fewer flights. This scale suits holiday peaks and corporate travel days, supporting long-haul demand while protecting on-time performance and crew productivity.

Emirates, Lufthansa, and British Airways have returned the airbus a380 to service, with the Emirates A380 retrofit focusing on premium cabins and refreshed interiors. These fleet moves target high-demand corridors where loyalty and comfort lift fares. A detailed German report charts the type’s near-miss and comeback source.

Leisure, visiting friends and family, and premium travel to the Middle East and Asia remain robust out of Germany. The airbus a380’s capacity helps airlines manage uneven seasonal spikes, spreading unit costs over more seats. When load factors stay high, airlines can defend margins even if yields drift, sustaining long-haul demand despite more available capacity.

Investor lens: capacity, yields, services

Airlines weigh bigger aircraft against more frequencies. The airbus a380 favors trunk routes where slot scarcity and staffing constraints limit adds. For airports, each arrival brings more spending per movement. For investors, this supports airline capacity planning that defends unit costs and aids airport revenue per passenger through retail, parking, and lounge services.

Cabin refits target seats that drive yield. The Emirates A380 retrofit aligns with a premium shift, aiming to stabilize revenue as capacity grows. For German routes, loyalty and corporate contracts matter. The airbus a380 can magnify upsell across business, premium economy, and ancillaries. Still, watch for fare pressure if supply grows faster than bookings source.

A380 production is closed, but services are active. Cabin refreshes, heavy checks, and interiors work support MRO providers and parts distributors. Airbus benefits from services and technical support, while Lufthansa Technik and European suppliers see workload from inspections and retrofits. The airbus a380 comeback extends asset lives, widening the base for stable services revenue.

Supply chain and fleet strategy risks

High seat counts can lower emissions per passenger when full, helping with EU climate goals. Yet the airbus a380 requires compatible gates and two-bridge boarding. German policy on sustainable aviation fuel and airport noise can add costs. Investors should track how carriers keep load factors high to protect unit economics and align with environmental rules.

The airbus a380 relies on complex engine maintenance cycles. Parts availability, shop capacity, and technician shortages can drive turnaround times. Training for crews and ground handlers adds cost. If maintenance backlogs rise, airlines may swap aircraft types or trim schedules. That could soften long-haul demand recovery on select routes and alter capacity plans.

Frankfurt and Munich already support large-gauge operations, but winter conditions and slot governance still matter. Turn times and gate availability influence reliability and retail capture. Capital spending will likely stay targeted, not expansive. Investors should watch airport guidance on passenger flow, aeronautical charges, and service quality as the airbus a380 footprint grows.

What to watch in 2025 for German investors

Monitor published timetables and alliance feed into German hubs. The airbus a380 will likely focus on thick, time-sensitive markets served by partners across Europe. Added seats can pull fares lower at the margin, but strong premium sales can offset. Watch how joint ventures adjust capacity and connect traffic flows through Frankfurt and Munich.

Track commentary from Lufthansa Group, Airbus services, and major airports on long-haul demand, cabin projects, and summer build-up. Bookings for Easter and the June to September peak will guide yields. The airbus a380 retrofit wave can lift maintenance and interiors revenue, while airlines balance cash between debt, fleet, and shareholder returns.

Fuel is priced in US dollars, so euro weakness can raise costs for German carriers. Policy shifts on ETS, ticket taxes, and sustainable aviation fuel blending can affect margins. The airbus a380’s economics improve with high utilization. Investors should watch hedging, load factors, and on-time performance to assess cash generation into year-end.

Final Thoughts

For German investors, the airbus a380 comeback underscores a simple read: long-haul demand is still firm, slot-limited hubs prize seat density, and premium cabins remain a revenue anchor. Production is closed, but services, upgrades, and MRO activity expand as fleets stay in use longer. Airports benefit from more passengers per movement, which can lift non-aeronautical income. The main risks are maintenance bottlenecks, staffing, and policy costs that can erode margins if load factors slip. Actionable next steps: track summer schedules on trunk routes, monitor guidance from airlines and airports, and watch retrofit pipelines. If capacity grows in line with bookings, cash flow resilience should hold through 2025.

FAQs

Why are airlines bringing back the airbus a380 now?

Slot limits, strong long-haul demand, and full premium cabins make the airbus a380 efficient on trunk routes. High load factors lower unit costs, while refreshed cabins support yields. With production closed, airlines focus on services and upgrades to extend asset life without large new aircraft capex.

How does the Emirates A380 retrofit affect revenue?

The Emirates A380 retrofit adds appeal in premium and refreshed economy cabins, aiming to protect yields as capacity rises. Better seats drive upsell, loyalty, and higher ancillary spend. For German routes, this can steady revenue per passenger even if fares face mild pressure during peak capacity periods.

What does the A380 comeback mean for German airports?

More seats per movement can lift retail, food and beverage, and lounge revenue without adding many flights. Frankfurt and Munich already support large-gauge gates, so throughput can improve. Risks include winter operations, staffing, and gate availability that can impact turn times and on-time performance.

Is Airbus benefiting if A380 production is closed?

Yes, through services. The airbus a380 revival extends demand for maintenance, parts, and technical support. Cabin upgrades and heavy checks create recurring revenue opportunities. While new-build sales are absent, the services footprint and supplier ecosystem can still generate cash flow as active fleets remain in operation.",https://meyka.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/featured_image-4923.png,N,,2025-12-28 17:11:40.201082

But a new study suggests the climate crisis is, at its core, a financial crisis. The staggering sums needed to transition to clean energy dwarf what governments alone can provide. The transition to a clean energy future is no longer a technological fantasy. Solar and wind are now often cheaper than fossil fuels. Electric vehicles are mainstream. So why does the transition feel so slow? The single biggest obstacle is finance. Bridging that multi-trillion-dollar gap is about rewiring the entire global industrial base — energy, transportation, agriculture, and manufacturing — all at once. This requires capital on a scale that dwarfs the Apollo programme. Governments simply do not have these sums.

The only source is private capital. Yet, the global financial system has not yet been harnessed into these critical projects. There is a mismatch between the risks of green investments and what traditional finance rewards. Building a grid-scale battery storage facility requires enormous capital today for returns that may materialise over 20-30 years. Most private investors demand quicker, more predictable returns. Investors also fear betting on the wrong solution. A fossil fuel power plant, by contrast, has a known business model. For many solutions, like sustainable aviation fuel or green steel, the cost is still higher than the dirty alternative. Who pays that premium? The market hasn’t yet figured it out, creating uncertainty for investors.

Perhaps the most perverse bottleneck is that the price of capital often fails to reflect the true cost of climate change, seen as a massive market failure. Fossil fuel investments have long enjoyed an implicit subsidy because their price does not include the colossal social and environmental costs — the healthcare bills from pollution, the disaster recovery from extreme weather, the existential threat of a destabilised climate. Because these “externalities” aren’t on the balance sheet, dirty investments can appear artificially profitable. Simultaneously, the massive systemic risk that climate change poses to the entire financial portfolio — from flooded coastal assets to collapsed agricultural supply chains — is still not accurately priced in. Investors are, in effect, making decisions with a blindfold on, unable to see the true risk of inaction. The Result? Capital continues to flow towards the old economy, effectively subsidising our own destruction, while the new economy struggles to attract funding despite being the only viable long-term path.

Solving this is requires making projects palatable for private investors. And creating new ways to bundle, securitise, and trade green assets to improve liquidity and attract different types of capital. Not to mention mandating clear, consistent climate risk disclosure so the market can finally price risk accurately. We have the technology. But without a financial system redesigned to fund it, the energy transition will remain a dream. Unleashing private capital is the only option.

The focus of academic literature is overwhelmingly on the role of public finance. Papers on topics like carbon pricing, green bonds, and the cost of capital for green investments are dwarfed by a preoccupation with government policy and public funding. Yes, smart public policy is an essential catalyst. But governments don’t have the balance sheets to build a global network of renewable energy plants.

Greener Travel in 2025 Sets a New Course for Tourism","Greener travel in 2025 gained solid momentum as global tourism embraced sustainability, responsible choice and innovative travel practices. This shift came at a pivotal moment for international tourism, with both travellers and industry stakeholders recognising that environmental stewardship must match the sector’s economic recovery. Official data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UN Tourism) shows international overnight arrivals grew by five percent through much of 2025, indicating that travel demand remained strong at a time when sustainability messages were gaining traction.

Tourism’s environmental impact has long been a concern for national governments and travel authorities. The cumulative footprint of tourism, including transport, accommodations, activities and support systems, contributes roughly eight percent of global carbon emissions, according to environmental assessments. This reality has driven policy dialogue and practical change across destinations and travel markets alike.

Sustainable Tourism Moves to Strategic Priority in 2025

The UN Tourism World Tourism Barometer also documents how destinations recovered pre‑pandemic travel volumes in 2024 and continued ascending in 2025, reinforcing that destination management must evolve to protect natural and cultural assets while meeting visitor expectations.

In response, national tourism bodies and policymakers added sustainability to core strategies guiding investment, regulation and product development. Sustainable tourism, defined by the UN as travel that addresses environmental, social and economic impacts while protecting host communities and ecosystems, became a central pillar for destination planning and marketing.

Carbon‑Neutral and Low‑Impact Travel Trends

Industry bodies and researchers identified carbon‑neutral and carbon‑negative tourism options as a key trending theme in 2025. These approaches include travellers choosing travel packages that compensate for emissions through verified initiatives or actively reduce more carbon than they emit by supporting renewable energy and ecosystem restoration projects.

In parallel, ecotourism and nature‑based travel gained traction. Travellers increasingly selected experiences that emphasise conservation, biodiversity and community benefits over mass tourism patterns. Protected forests, marine parks and wildlife corridors drew interest as places where visitor activity supports both environmental protection and local livelihoods.

Transport Choices and Cleaner Aviation

Transport remains the largest source of tourism‑related emissions, particularly aviation. Government strategies and industry dialogues in 2025 highlighted the importance of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other cleaner propulsion technologies. While adoption rates vary by country, SAF was emphasised by transport authorities as a long‑term solution for reducing carbon intensity in air travel.

Rail and other low‑emission transport modes also featured in greener travel planning. Many destinations encouraged travellers to reduce short‑haul flights when alternatives such as high‑speed trains or buses offered lower footprints and attractive scenic experiences. These choices aligned with official tourism recommendations for lowering environmental impact while enhancing visitor engagement.

Digital Tools Empower Conscious Travel

2025 saw advances in digital transparency and smart travel tools that helped travellers make informed decisions. While specific government platforms vary by country, digital solutions increasingly included carbon labelling for transport and accommodations, real‑time sustainability indicators and itineraries highlighting responsible tourism options. Official policy frameworks supported these tools as part of broader tourism digital transformation strategies.

These technologies reduced complexity in planning by enabling travellers to select eco‑friendly options without sacrificing convenience. Governments and destination marketing organisations integrated digital features into promotional portals to highlight sustainable offerings and low‑impact routes.

Community‑Centred Travel and Local Experiences

Conscious tourism in 2025 also included rising demand for community‑centred travel, where travellers opted for local homestays, guided tours by community leaders and sustainability‑oriented experiences. This trend reduces leakage from local economies and enhances cultural preservation by linking tourism revenue to community projects and conservation efforts.

Local experiences also contributed to a richer travel narrative, enabling destinations to balance environmental protection with economic inclusion. Governments woven these priorities into tourism strategy frameworks, emphasising cultural integrity alongside sustainability goals.

Strategic Policy Shifts and Global Alignment

Governments and international bodies reaffirmed the importance of embedding sustainability into long‑term tourism planning. Policy recommendations from the World Economic Forum’s sustainable travel frameworks underscore integrating environmental stewardship, heritage protection and community resilience into destination strategies worldwide.

This alignment between policy and practice indicated that greener travel was not a fleeting trend in 2025 but a structural shift shaping tourism’s future direction.

As governments refine tax credits for low carbon fuels and aviation bodies publish new guidance on how to count the benefits of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, corporate travel managers and sustainability officers say clearer, globally aligned rules could unlock far more investment and faster emissions reductions from flying.

New SAF Accounting Rules Put Corporate Travel in the Spotlight

In March 2025, the International Air Transport Association introduced a new SAF Accounting & Reporting Methodology and upgraded its CO2 Connect emissions calculator to show the impact of SAF purchases on flight emissions.

The move gives airlines and corporate customers a consistent way to reflect the carbon benefits of SAF in per passenger data, an essential step for companies that must report business travel emissions under climate targets or disclosure rules.

IATA’s approach initially spreads the emissions reduction from an airline’s total SAF use evenly across its network, so every flight receives the same percentage cut based on total SAF volumes.

Future versions are expected to allow more granular allocation along specific routes, which would give corporate clients greater flexibility to match their own SAF contributions with particular markets or travel corridors.

For global companies, this type of standardized methodology is critical. Many have adopted Science Based Targets initiative pathways that require credible, auditable accounting of aviation emissions.

Without a common rulebook, a tonne of emissions reduction from SAF can be counted in different ways depending on which airline or intermediary issues the claim, undermining trust and depressing demand from corporate buyers that might otherwise pay a premium to clean up their travel.

Tax Credit Guidance Raises the Stakes for Clear Definitions

On the policy side, the United States has been refining its incentives for low carbon fuels, including jet fuel. A temporary sustainable aviation fuel credit, known as Section 40B, took effect for fuel used after 2022 and before 2025.

It pays at least 1.25 dollars per gallon of SAF blended into jet fuel, with a supplemental amount that increases for fuels achieving more than a 50 percent lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction.

From January 1, 2025, that incentive begins to roll into a broader Clean Fuel Production Credit, Section 45Z, which offers 35 cents per gallon for SAF at its base rate and scales with the carbon intensity of the fuel.

Recent Treasury and Internal Revenue Service guidance clarifies which producers can claim the credit, what fuels qualify and how lifecycle emissions must be calculated. Separate safe harbor notices explain how models such as the 40BSAF GREET 2024 tool may be used to determine emissions reductions and to certify that fuel meets sustainability requirements.

These technical rules might appear distant from a corporate travel policy. Yet they determine which types of SAF qualify, which producers attract financing and how quickly volumes scale.

If credit rules are ambiguous or swing between models that favor different feedstocks, investors sit on the sidelines and fuel remains scarce and expensive. For multinationals trying to decarbonize their travel, that means limited availability of credible SAF options and higher costs for the limited volumes they can buy.

Book and Claim Emerges as a Bridge for Corporate Buyers

One of the most promising mechanisms to bridge SAF supply and corporate demand is the so called book and claim model. Under this approach, a company finances the use of SAF on flights it may never board, typically at a production or hub airport, and in return receives a certificate that represents the associated emissions reduction.

The actual fuel is “booked” into the aviation system and physically burned elsewhere, but the climate benefit is “claimed” by the buyer for its own reporting.

In March 2025, Airbus announced a pilot book and claim program that uses a registry managed by the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials to track SAF attributes. Several leasing companies and business aviation operators have already signed memoranda of understanding to participate.

For corporate travel, this model offers flexibility: a company whose main travel routes are not served by SAF can still finance additional production and legitimately claim the emissions reduction, if accounting rules recognize the transaction.

However, the integrity of book and claim depends on robust standards to avoid double counting. There must be clear rules about who can claim the reduction, whether multiple entities can share it and how it appears in emissions inventories.

IATA’s updated methodology begins to lay down such rules, but many observers say further alignment is needed between aviation bodies, voluntary carbon markets and national regulators before global companies can confidently rely on book and claim to shrink reported travel emissions at scale.

Corporate Climate Targets Collide With Patchwork Standards

Companies with net zero or science based climate targets are under growing pressure to reduce travel related emissions, not simply offset them with unrelated projects.

Yet in aviation, direct emissions cuts from efficiency measures and operational changes are limited; the bulk of long term reductions will depend on cleaner fuels. As a result, SAF is increasingly central to corporate decarbonization plans, especially for hard to abate long-haul travel where alternatives such as high speed rail are unavailable.

The challenge, sustainability executives say, is that accounting frameworks have not kept pace with the rapid evolution of SAF products and procurement models. Some standards classify SAF certificates as akin to energy attribute certificates, which can be counted inside a company’s Scope 3 inventory under certain conditions.

Others treat them more like carbon offsets, with different eligibility rules and disclosure requirements. The Science Based Targets initiative has signaled support for SAF as a decarbonization lever, but detailed guidance on how to claim benefits in corporate inventories is still maturing.

This patchwork leaves travel managers in a bind. If different auditors or reporting standards interpret a SAF purchase differently across regions, a company risks over or under counting its progress, or having to restate its emissions data later.

Faced with that uncertainty, some firms choose to limit SAF investments to pilot projects rather than integrating them deeply into travel programs. Clearer, harmonized rules could flip that calculation and unlock much larger volumes of demand.

Cost, Supply and the Risk of Overpromising Emissions Cuts

Even with better rules, the economics of SAF present a serious constraint. Industry analyses suggest that SAF still costs between three and five times as much as conventional jet fuel, depending on feedstock and production pathway.

A report from Boston Consulting Group in 2025 warned that SAF production is on track to fall 30 to 45 percent short of aviation’s 2030 targets, despite a more than tenfold increase in supply over the past three years.

For airlines, that price premium must be recovered somehow. Corporate customers are often the first in line. Many carriers now offer “green fare” bundles or bilateral agreements in which business clients pay extra to underwrite SAF use, in exchange for claims on associated emissions reductions.

Without consistent accounting rules, however, companies that pay those premiums may be uncertain whether they can actually count the reductions toward regulated or voluntary targets. The fear of paying twice once for the fuel, and again in reputational terms if claims are later challenged is a major barrier.

There is also a risk that poorly defined rules could enable overclaiming. If multiple parties are allowed to take credit for the same SAF volume for example, the airline, the corporate buyer and potentially a third party offset scheme the same emissions reduction could appear several times in global inventories.

That would undermine trust in SAF as a climate solution and could trigger regulatory crackdowns that chill investment. To avoid that outcome, corporate buyers are pushing for registries and certificates that can be traced, retired and audited, similar to renewable electricity tracking systems.

Regulators, Airlines and Corporates Search for a Common Language

Efforts to clarify SAF rules are gathering pace on several fronts. In addition to tax and modeling guidance from U.S. authorities, European policymakers are implementing blending mandates that require a rising share of jet fuel sold in the bloc to be sustainable over the next decade.

These mandates effectively create guaranteed demand, but they also force regulators to define precisely what counts as SAF, which feedstocks are acceptable and how lifecycle emissions are measured.

Industry bodies are trying to keep up. Beyond IATA’s emissions calculator update, standard setting organizations in sustainable finance and non financial reporting are wrestling with how to treat SAF purchases in disclosure frameworks.

Corporate travel buyers are increasingly represented in these conversations, arguing that clear, simple rules would allow them to commit to multi year offtake agreements that support new SAF plants. Without that, developers struggle to secure financing and project pipelines stall.

Some observers point to the history of renewable electricity markets as a template. There, energy attribute certificates and guarantees of origin evolved over time into robust systems that allow corporates to claim the benefits of renewable power purchases, even when electrons are not physically delivered to their facilities.

Advocates say a similar trajectory is possible for aviation, but only if stakeholders converge on compatible registry systems, verification practices and contractual terms.

What Travel Managers Can Do Now

While many of the rules are still in flux, corporate travel and sustainability teams are not entirely powerless. Experts recommend that companies start by mapping their current and projected aviation footprint, identifying the routes and carriers that contribute most to emissions.

They can then engage airlines and travel management companies to understand what SAF or book and claim options are available, and under what accounting assumptions.

Legal and finance teams, meanwhile, should follow developments in tax policy and international standards to assess which SAF purchases will hold up under audit.

Companies that operate private or charter aircraft may also have the ability to participate directly in producer level credit schemes, particularly where they can aggregate demand across multiple business units or partners.

Critically, travel managers are encouraged to be transparent with internal stakeholders about what SAF can and cannot deliver today. While it offers real and necessary emissions reductions, limited supply and evolving rules mean that SAF alone cannot neutralize all aviation emissions in the near term.

Combining demand reduction, modal shifts where possible, and targeted SAF investments aligned with emerging accounting standards is likely to be the most resilient strategy.

FAQ

Q1: What is sustainable aviation fuel and how does it reduce emissions?

SAF is jet fuel made from renewable or low carbon feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues or captured carbon. When certified under approved lifecycle models, it can deliver at least 50 percent lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional jet fuel over its full production and use cycle.

Q2: Why are clearer rules needed for corporate SAF use?

Corporate buyers need to know exactly how to count the emissions reductions from SAF in their carbon inventories and climate targets. Without clear and harmonized rules, companies risk double counting, inconsistent reporting across standards and potential challenges from auditors or regulators, which undermines confidence and limits investment.

Q3: What is book and claim in the context of SAF?

Book and claim is a system in which a company pays for SAF to be produced and used somewhere in the aviation network, then receives a certificate representing the associated emissions reduction. The company can claim that reduction for reporting, even if its own employees are not physically on the flights that burned the SAF.

Q4: How do recent U.S. tax credits influence SAF adoption?

U.S. tax credits such as the former Section 40B and the new Section 45Z lower the effective cost of producing SAF by paying producers based on the fuel’s carbon intensity. These incentives can make SAF projects financially viable and increase supply, which is essential if corporate customers are to access enough fuel to meaningfully cut travel emissions.

Q5: Are airlines already offering SAF options to corporate clients?

Yes, many airlines offer SAF based programs, ranging from green fares that bundle a small SAF contribution into ticket prices to bespoke agreements where large corporate clients co fund specific SAF volumes and receive detailed emissions accounting in return.

Q6: How expensive is SAF compared with conventional jet fuel?

Estimates vary by technology and feedstock, but SAF typically costs three to five times more than traditional jet fuel. Tax credits, mandates and corporate co funding can narrow that gap, but higher prices remain a key barrier to widespread adoption.

Q7: Can multiple parties claim the same SAF emissions reduction?

In principle they should not, but in practice this is a core concern. Without robust registries and clear rules about claim ownership and certificate retirement, there is a risk that the same emissions reduction could be reported by several parties. Emerging accounting frameworks aim to prevent this through transparent tracking systems.

Q8: How do international climate standards view SAF purchases?

Most major frameworks recognize SAF as a legitimate decarbonization tool for aviation, but they are still refining exactly how claims should be reflected in Scope 3 emissions and target progress. Companies are advised to follow evolving guidance from initiatives such as the Science Based Targets initiative and to document their assumptions clearly.

Q9: What practical steps can a travel manager take today?

Travel managers can engage with preferred airlines about SAF programs, pilot small book and claim purchases, coordinate with sustainability teams on reporting implications and update travel policies to prioritize routes and partners that offer verifiable SAF options, while also encouraging virtual meetings and low carbon alternatives where feasible.",https://thetraveler.s3.amazonaws.com/images/dusk-airport-sustainability-dashboard-refuel.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 20:12:00.822399

Er is niet genoeg frituurolie in de wereld om meer dan één dag luchtvaart te voeden.""","SAF is duurder dan gewone kerosine en dat zal waarschijnlijk voorlopig ook zo blijven, aangezien het aanbod laag is. Zo drukten grote oliemaatschappijen als Shell en BP onlangs op de rem wat betreft de productie van SAF. Ze denken er (nu) te weinig geld mee te kunnen verdienen.

De Europese Commissie sprak eerder dit jaar van een 'kip en ei-situatie'. Kort gezegd: de luchtvaart wacht tot er meer geproduceerd wordt, terwijl producenten wachten tot er meer vraag komt. Er wordt gesproken van 'marktfalen' aan de aanbodzijde van de SAF-markt.

KLM pleit daarom voor een nationaal SAF-fonds, zodat SAF sneller en goedkoper geproduceerd kan worden. De luchtvaartmaatschappij voelt zich gesterkt door het advies dat voormalig ASML-topman Peter Wennink eerder deze maand naar buiten bracht. Daarin werd Sustainable Aviation Fuel genoemd als een middel op weg naar verduurzaming van de luchtvaart. En KLM deed dus een proef. Daarover later meer.

Wat is SAF?

SAF staat voor Sustainable Aviation Fuel, duurzame vliegtuigbrandstof. Deze brandstof wordt gemaakt uit hernieuwbare energiebronnen, vooralsnog vooral gebruikt frituurvet of andere plantaardige materialen. Waterstof is op termijn wellicht ook mogelijk, maar is vooralsnog toekomstmuziek.

Luchtvaart hoeft minder biobrandstof bij te mengen na druk uit Brussel

KLM noemt het 'alternatieve vliegtuigbrandstof', omdat SAF nog steeds voor schadelijke uitstoot zorgt en dus niet volledig duurzaam is. SAF heeft volgens de luchtvaartmaatschappij wel bepaalde voordelen ten opzichte van 'traditionele' kerosine. ""Hoewel SAF tijdens de vlucht evenveel CO2 uitstoot, is de totale CO2-impact over de hele levenscyclus (van productie tot verbranding) minstens 65 procent lager.""

Daarnaast zorgt het gebruik van SAF voor minder uitstoot van schadelijke stoffen zoals fijnstof en zwavel. SAF zou daardoor gezien kunnen worden als een stap(je) op de route naar groen vliegen, voor zover dat ooit mogelijk gaat zijn. Daarom zijn er in Europa afgesproken gemaakt over het gebruik van SAF.

Bijmengverplichting

Om de luchtvaart duurzamer te maken, is afgesproken dat een deel van de door vliegmaatschappijen gebruikte brandstof SAF moet zijn. Met een mooi woord bijmengverplichting genaamd, want SAF belandt gewoon samen met kerosine in de tank van het vliegtuig.

Op dit moment gaat het om 2 procent SAF, dit percentage moet in 2050 richting de 70 procent zijn gegroeid. Het gaat om alle vluchten die vanaf Europese luchthavens vertrekken.

Maar dan moet er natuurlijk wel genoeg SAF zijn. En hier zit de crux. ""Luchtvaartmaatschappijen maken zich zorgen over de meerkosten van SAF"", zegt Bram Peerlings, onderzoeker luchtvaartverduurzaming bij Koninklijk Nederlands Lucht- en Ruimtevaartcentrum.

""Omdat de Europese bijmengverplichting voor nu nog op 2 procent staat, is de kostenimpact daarvan nog beperkt."" Doordat dit percentage toeneemt, worden de kosten voor vliegtuigmaatschappijen dus hoger. Zie hier de spagaat van luchtvaartmaatschappijen.

""Maatschappijen maken te weinig winst om die meerprijs uit eigen zak te betalen, maar zijn bezorgd dat als ze de meerkosten verrekenen in de ticketprijzen, hun passagiers overstappen naar een concurrent. Of dat ook waar is, kun je alleen maar testen"", vervolgt Peerlings.

En zo'n proef heeft KLM gedaan. De Nederlandse luchtvaartmaatschappij verhoogde voor vluchten in september de ticketprijzen op de routes van Amsterdam naar Londen (20 euro extra) en Hamburg (16,25 euro extra).

Shell stopt definitief met biobrandstoffenfabriek in Rotterdam

""Op deze manier wordt de bereidwilligheid van passagiers onderzocht om extra te betalen voor SAF als dit standaard in het ticket inbegrepen is"", zegt een woordvoerder van KLM tegen RTL Z. De brandstoftank op deze vluchten was overigens niet volledig gevuld met SAF. Nee, het percentage bleef 2 procent. Het ging dus echt om een gedragsproef.

Iedereen betaalt al een beetje

Goed om te weten is dat iedereen bij KLM al heel klein beetje voor SAF betaalt. Dit bedrag (tussen de 3 en 30 euro) hangt af van de bestemming en reisklasse. Peerlings verwacht dat de ticketprijzen voor alle maatschappijen zullen stijgen op het moment dat ze (verplicht of eventueel vrijwillig) meer SAF gaan bijmengen.

Daarom peilt KLM alvast wat een hogere bijdrage doet met het gedrag van passagiers. De conclusie volgens KLM: ""Een belangrijk inzicht uit de proef is dat veel passagiers nog onvoldoende weten wat SAF precies is."" Hierdoor waren de deelnemende passagiers er zich volgens KLM niet voldoende van bewust dat zij een ander ticket dan normaal kochten.

Als eerste op de hoogte van het laatste nieuws

Peerlings noemt het hoopgevend dat KLM aangeeft dat de vliegtuigen nog steeds vol zaten. ""Dat laat namelijk zien dat passagiers bereid zijn om de extra kosten voor SAF te betalen.""

""Het is daarbij wel belangrijk om te noemen dat de meerprijs voor SAF op deze kortere routes maar beperkt is én dat de routes veel zakenreizigers trekken, die vaak minder prijsgevoelig zijn. Of deze conclusies ook voor andere routes gelden, zou verder onderzoek moeten uitwijzen"", vervolgt Peerlings.

""Momenteel buigen we ons over een eventuele nieuwe proef"", zegt de woordvoerder van KLM hierover. Meer wil de luchtvaartmaatschappij er niet over kwijt.

Duurder ticket?

Of ticketprijzen zullen stijgen door SAF, daarover houdt KLM zich op ook op de vlakte. ""Een ticket bestaat natuurlijk uit meerdere componenten. Het is dus niet zo dat als SAF duurder wordt, de ticketprijs automatisch ook stijgt. Juist omdat de prijs van meerdere variabelen afhankelijk is.""

Hoe vliegtuigstrepen de aarde extra opwarmen: 'verdubbeling van opwarmend effect'

Passagiers kunnen trouwens ook nu al uit eigen beweging een SAF-bijdrage betalen. Dit wordt volgens de woordvoerder van KLM nauwelijks gedaan. ""Een half procent van de passagiers boekt vrijwillig extra SAF bij boven op het ticket."" Dit geld wordt volgens de luchtvaartmaatschappij volledig in SAF gestoken.

Rol overheid

De uitgesproken Ryanair-topman Michael O'Leary noemt SAF op dit moment een trucje en onzin. ""Tenzij overheden zich achter de productie en inkoop van duurzame vliegtuigbrandstoffen scharen"", liet hij optekenen in de Britse krant The Guardian.

Hij zegt dat ook oliegiganten op moeten staan en dat het zonder deze spelers moeilijk wordt om genoeg SAF te produceren. ""Wil je dat iedereen rondrent om verdomme frituurolie te verzamelen? Er is niet genoeg frituurolie in de wereld om meer dan één dag luchtvaart te voeden.""

KLM kijkt vooral naar het Rijk en het nieuwe kabinet. ""Alleen met een actieve rol van de overheid maken we opschaling en betaalbaarheid mogelijk"", meent CEO Marjan Rintel.

The primary goal of the tax cut is to boost the competitiveness of Germany as an aviation hub. German airports are currently handling passenger volumes at only about 90% of pre-pandemic levels, while many other European countries have exceeded those figures around 110%.

Schnieder emphasized that airlines decide their own pricing and routes, and the tax relief is meant to encourage them to maintain or expand operations in Germany rather than shifting flights elsewhere.

He told the Funke Media Group: “There is no automatic mechanism for lower ticket prices.” The head of the German Airport Association (ADV), Ralph Beisel, agreed, stating that the measure aims to strengthen Germany’s position in air travel competition, not directly lower fares.

This tax reduction reverses part of a 2024 increase introduced under the previous government. Earlier reports in 2025 suggested potential cheaper flights due to the cut, but airlines are not obligated to pass on the savings to consumers—they may use it to improve profitability or invest in routes.

This news broke amid ongoing discussions about Germany’s aviation sector lagging behind European peers. Taxation of aviation remains largely a national competence, with significant exemptions at the EU level driven by historical international agreements like the 1944 Chicago Convention and the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD, 2003/96/EC).

No EU-wide tax on kerosene— aviation fuel: Commercial aviation fuel is exempt from excise duties for intra-EU and international flights. This exemption applies across all member states, though domestic flights could theoretically be taxed none are as of late 2025.

No mandatory EU-wide ticket tax: Air passenger duties or “ticket taxes” are implemented nationally by some countries, varying widely in rates and structure. VAT on tickets: International flights are generally VAT-exempt; domestic flights may be subject to national VAT rates in some states.

Other mechanisms: Aviation emissions are addressed through the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which covers intra-EU flights and is expanding, rather than direct taxes. Proposals to introduce EU-wide kerosene taxation as part of the “Fit for 55” package (2021) have stalled due to lack of unanimous agreement in the Council.

Negotiations on revising the ETD remain blocked as of December 2025, with discussions around potential delays or exemptions for aviation fuel lasting until 2033–2045 or longer. ETD prohibits taxation except via bilateral agreements, none exist. Criticized as a subsidy worth €13–35 billion annually across the EU.

Ticket Taxes

No EU-wide harmonization; national only. Some calls (e.g., 2019 joint statement by 9 finance ministers) for uniform passenger taxes, but not implemented. VAT on international tickets exempted which aligns with international norms; domestic tickets may incur VAT in ~17 states.

EU ETS for Aviation; Applies to intra-EU flights; expanding to all departing flights. Market-based carbon pricing alternative to fuel taxes.

Several member states levy departure-based passenger taxes often distance-tiered. Rates are approximate and subject to change; Many countries e.g., Spain, Netherlands, Belgium have no or minimal passenger taxes. This patchwork creates competitive distortions, with airlines and hubs in low-tax countries benefiting.

Exemptions are seen as subsidies distorting competition with greener transport. Groups like Transport & Environment estimate a €35–47 billion annual “tax gap” if aviation were taxed like road fuels. Industry opposition: Airlines argue taxes reduce competitiveness, increase ticket prices without guaranteeing emission reductions, and duplicate ETS.

Stalled reforms: The 2021 ETD revision proposed phasing in kerosene taxes (2023–2033) with zero rates for sustainable fuels, but lacks consensus. Recent drafts suggest prolonged exemptions due to limited sustainable aviation fuel availability.

In summary, EU air travel taxation prioritizes exemptions to support connectivity and competitiveness, relying on ETS for emissions control. National variations persist, with no immediate shift toward EU-wide fuel or ticket taxes expected.",https://www.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lufthansa.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 17:11:55.295640

Kampala, Uganda | JULIUS BUSINGE | Uganda’s aviation industry is charting an ambitious growth path, underpinned by major infrastructure upgrades, strategic international partnerships, and a strong commitment to sustainable and safe air transport.

The outlook was shared during the annual Stakeholders’ Engagement Breakfast hosted by the Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA) at Imperial Royale Hotel in Kampala on Dec.16.

In a keynote address delivered by former Deputy Chief Justice Steven Kavuma, representing the Minister of State for Transport, Fred Byamukama, the government reaffirmed its support for the sector, highlighting its critical role in driving tourism, trade, and socio-economic development.

Uganda’s aviation sector is experiencing strong recovery and expansion. International passenger traffic at Entebbe International Airport from January to November 2025 reached 2.247 million, already surpassing the full-year 2024 total of 2.243 million. Cargo volumes for the same period matched the entirety of 2024.

“The January to November 2025 traffic has already surpassed the entire 2024 traffic even before adding the busy December,” noted UCAA Director General Fred K. Bamwesigye in his presentation. He attributed the growth to new routes launched by Uganda Airlines to London Gatwick, Harare, and Kinshasa, alongside new entrants such as Flynas, Fanjet Express, Malawi Airlines, and Safarilink.

Widened connectivity

Uganda has also expanded its global connectivity through Bilateral Air Service Agreements (BASAs), now holding agreements with 64 countries. Recent signings include Qatar, the Central African Republic, Latvia, and Ethiopia.

A major highlight is the soon-to-be-opened 20,000-square-meter Passenger Terminal Building at Entebbe International Airport, featuring five aerobridges, 24 new check-in counters, and 14 self-check-in kiosks. The facility will increase annual passenger capacity from 2 million to 3.5 million when opened in phases from January 2026.

Beyond Entebbe, the government is fast-tracking airport upgrades across the country to support tourism and regional connectivity. Key projects include the development of Kabalega International Airport in Hoima, Kidepo International Airport in Karamoja, and the elevation of Arua, Kasese, and Gulu airports to international status. Gulu’s upgrade is being accelerated to facilitate Uganda’s hosting of the Africa Cup of Nations in 2027.

In line with global aviation’s push toward decarbonization, Uganda is positioning itself as a regional leader in sustainable aviation. The country voluntarily joined ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) in 2019 and recently completed a feasibility study on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production.

“The study confirms that Uganda has significant potential to produce SAF using its rich biomass resources,” Bamwesigye stated. The program now moves to developing a national business case, with estimated production potential of 300–850 million liters annually.

Uganda’s election to the ICAO Council for the 2025–2028 term with 155 votes reflects its growing influence in global aviation governance. “Uganda is honoured to take up this responsibility and to contribute to advancing safe, secure, and sustainable air transport globally,” Bamwesigye said.

The sector is also advancing institutional reforms, with a roadmap now in place to separate regulatory functions from airport and air navigation service provision—a move aimed at enhancing efficiency, eliminating conflicts of interest, and aligning with international best practices.

Inadequate funding

Despite progress, challenges remain, including inadequate funding for upcountry aerodromes, land constraints at Entebbe, and growing government debt to UCAA, which stood at UGX 166.6 billion as of June 2025.

Looking ahead, Uganda plans to host major international aviation events, including the IFATCA Conference and AATO meeting in 2027, and will launch a reviewed 20-year Master Plan for Entebbe International Airport in 2026.

In his remarks delivered by Justice Kavuma, Minister Byamukama urged stakeholders to maintain high service standards. “As the Authority prepares to open the new terminal, I urge all service providers to ensure that the services they render to passengers match the revamped infrastructure.”

With sustained investment, clear regulatory vision, and a commitment to sustainability, Uganda’s aviation sector is poised to become a key engine for national and regional growth in the coming decade.",https://www.independent.co.ug/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ebb-airport-new.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 17:12:08.021154

While the airfare is covered by miles, passengers still have to pay the taxes and surcharges in cash.

You don’t notice these as much on commercial tickets because they’re baked into the total price, and airlines will usually tweak the airfare to keep the overall amount palatable. But with award tickets, the entire burden falls on the passenger, and can be substantial. If you’re redeeming a Business Class ticket on Emirates from London to Singapore, for example, you’ll pay S$1,590 in taxes and surcharges. That’s a hefty sum to pay for a “free” ticket!

Fortunately, Singapore Airlines eliminated fuel surcharges in 2017, which means you only need to worry about the airport taxes. And since these can differ significantly depending on geography, there is the potential to minimise cash payments on award tickets by choosing your departure point carefully.

In this post we’ll look at the cheapest and most expensive airports to depart from across the Singapore Airlines network.

Location, location, location

Here’s an example showing how some simple repositioning or sequencing could lead to big cash savings.

Suppose you want to visit the UK and Spain on holiday, flying into Spain, then journeying up to the UK and flying back to Singapore. As a Business Class passenger, your flight home would include a whopping S$476.42 of taxes, thanks to the UK’s notorious Air Passenger Duty.

But what if you sequenced it the other way by visiting the UK first, then heading to Spain and ultimately back to Singapore? In this case, your flight home would have just S$30.84 of taxes, a saving of nearly S$450!

⚠️ Note If you want to be technical, the flight from the UK to Spain will be subject to APD, but at a much lower rate that starts from just £13. And in any case, you can always avoid it by taking the train instead.

Overall picture: Most and least expensive airports

Before we look at individual regions, here’s a summary of the total taxes and fees you’ll pay on a one-way award redemption to Singapore, for all the destinations in the Singapore Airlines network.

Within the SIA route network, the most expensive airport taxes on average are from Europe, while the USA, perhaps surprisingly, has the lowest. Of course, there can be large variations within regions, as our earlier example of London and Barcelona showed.

A couple of points to note.

Taxes are usually the same regardless of cabin

Generally speaking, you will pay the same airport taxes and fees regardless of cabin.

However, exceptions apply for Hong Kong, France, the Maldives and the UK.

Y PY J F London (Heathrow) £144.79 £274.79 London (Gatwick) £114.38 £244.38 Manchester £119.07 £249.07 Paris €96.35 €176.35 Hong Kong HKD 355 HKD 425 Maldives US$100 US$240 US$480

In the UK, the Air Passenger Duty (APD) adds a significant chunk to the cost of plane tickets. For long-haul international flights, you’ll have to pay £94 in Economy, and £224 in Premium Economy, Business and First Class, on top of the other charges imposed by the airport.

In France, the Air Passenger Solidarity Tax is charged at €40 for Economy and Premium Economy passengers, and €120 for Business and First Class passengers.

In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Airport Construction Fee payable on flights to Singapore is charged at HKD 90 for Economy and Premium Economy Class passengers, and HKD 160 for Business and First Class passengers.

And in the Maldives, the Airport Service Charge and Airport Development Fee were recently hiked to US$100 for Economy and Premium Economy Class passengers, US$240 for Business Class passengers, and US$480 for First Class passengers (good thing Singapore Airlines doesn’t offer First Class to the Maldives!).

Incidentally, Singapore will soon join the ranks of countries with differentiated airport taxes by cabin class, when it introduces the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy from October 2026. This is a “green tax” which ranges from S$1 to S$41.60, depending on cabin and class of travel.

Economy & Premium Economy Business & First Band 1

Southeast Asia S$1 S$4 Band 2

Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, Papua New Guinea S$2.80 S$11.20 Band 3

Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, Middle East, Pacific Islands, New Zealand S$6.40 S$25.60 Band 4

Americas S$10.40 S$41.60

Singapore flights to be hit by sustainable aviation fuel levy from October 2026

Stopovers can add to costs

A stopover may result in higher taxes than a non-stop flight, because of the additional fees charged by the transit airport. For example, flying non-stop to Singapore from New York JFK costs US$5.60, increasing to US$29.30 if a stopover in Frankfurt is added.

Non-stop One stop New York JFK US$5.60 US$29.30

(via FRA) Barcelona €20.39 €20.39

(via MXP) Los Angeles US$5.60 US$18

(via NRT)

However, this may not always be the case. You will pay the same €20.39 when you fly from Barcelona, whether you take the non-stop or one-stop flight (via Milan).

Hong Kong is the priciest airport in North Asia to fly from, particularly if you’re in First or Business Class. Otherwise, the taxes in this region are fairly modest and below S$50. Japan ranges from ~S$30-40, significantly lower than the last time I compiled these figures in 2019 owing to the depreciation of the JPY.

Regardless of which airport in mainland China you fly from, you’ll pay a standard CNY90 departure tax.

From South Asia

Within South Asia, the Maldives takes the cake as the most expensive airport to fly from, especially if you’re in a premium cabin. The recent hikes in airport taxes, Green Tax and T-GST have made this already expensive destination even pricier to visit, and I can’t say I’m itching to return.

This is also a good time to remember that what you pay for is not necessarily what you get. Delhi’s modernised airport is generally well-regarded (Best Airport in India & South Asia according to Skytrax, if that means anything to you), and charges just under S$30 worth of taxes. Meanwhile, Dhaka charges S$104, and let’s just say the reviews are mixed (thankfully, a new terminal is supposedly opening soon).

There isn’t a lot of variability within the MENA region, with Dubai, Cape Town and Johannesburg all attracting roughly the same taxes.

From Australia & New Zealand

Airport Business Economy 🇦🇺 Darwin S$125.81 S$125.81 🇦🇺 Adelaide S$106.54 S$106.54 🇦🇺 Cairns S$100.77 S$100.77 🇦🇺 Sydney S$100.14 S$100.14 🇦🇺 Melbourne S$98.50 S$98.50 🇦🇺 Brisbane S$97.04 S$97.04 🇦🇺 Perth S$82.87 S$82.87 🇳🇿 Auckland S$46.43 S$46.43 🇳🇿 Christchurch S$39.71 S$39.71

Airport taxes are significantly lower in New Zealand than Australia, but remember, New Zealand charges international arrivals an International Visitor Levy which costs NZ$100, on top of NZ$17 for an eTA!

Moreover, if you’re planning a trans-Tasman trip, you’ll still get hit with the full amount of airport taxes when flying between Australia and New Zealand, so there’s not much reason to reposition here for the purposes of cost savings alone.

Even within Australia, there can be significant variations in taxes. It costs S$82.87 to fly from Perth, compared to S$125.81 from Darwin, a 50% difference.

It’s worth noting that Australia is one of the few countries to charge an arrivals tax for incoming passengers, which will add an extra S$22.70 to S$38.70 to the cost of your flight from Singapore (more on this later).

From Europe

Europe is a classic example of how repositioning can result in big savings. And unlike other regions, it can often make practical sense, since tourists frequently visit multiple countries on a single trip, and intra-Europe flights/train rides are relatively affordable.

We’ve already seen the big disparity between the UK and Spain, but other (relatively) low-cost places to originate from include Turkey, Italy and surprisingly, Switzerland. France, Germany, Netherlands and Denmark are significantly more expensive, so try to fly into these destinations rather than out of them.

From USA

There’s not a lot to say here, because the taxes for award tickets on non-stop flights from the USA are all the same at US$5.60 (S$7.19).

The only time a difference will arise is if you’re taking the one-stop flights from LAX (transit NRT) and JFK (transit FRA).

Using the ITA Matrix to check taxes

If you want to check the most up-to-date taxes for your flight, you can do so via the ITA Matrix. This flight search engine shows a detailed breakdown of the taxes on a ticket, and which country they’re attributable to.

Do note that you may see “carrier-imposed surcharge” (YR) on certain Singapore Airlines flights. This is not imposed on award redemptions, so you can safely ignore it.

Also, the taxes shown on the ITA Matrix will not be accurate for award tickets in the following countries.

Country Remarks 🇺🇸 United States

(Inbound) International Arrival Tax is not charged on award bookings

(Outbound) Passenger Facility Charge and International Departure Tax are not charged on award bookings

🇮🇳 India

(Outbound) India Goods and Services Tax is a percentage of ticket cost and varies by cabin. It is not charged on award bookings as no cash is paid towards the fare component

🇵🇭 Philippines

(Outbound) Philippines Travel Tax does not apply to foreign passport holders staying for <1 year (and selected other groups). ITA Matrix still displays this nonetheless

To see the actual taxes payable for these destinations, you’ll need to make a dummy booking on the Singapore Airlines website.

What about flying out of Singapore?

The standard taxes on a one-way award flight departing from Singapore are currently set at S$65.20. This will increase over the next few years to S$79.20 by April 2030, as part of plans to hike airline and passenger fees to finance a S$3 billion airport investment.

Conclusion

While award tickets save you from having to pay the airfare, you’re still on the hook for taxes and surcharges. Depending on where you’re flying from, these can either be a mild inconvenience, or reason enough to rejig your travel plans. Since most taxes are charged to departing passengers, the general rule should be that you fly into expensive airports, and out from cheaper ones.

Unfortunately, Singapore is fast becoming one of the more expensive airports to fly out from, not just within Southeast Asia, but within Asia Pacific in general. That will only get worse with the new SAF levy, especially for those travelling in premium cabins on long-haul flights.",https://milelion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/haneda-airport.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 17:12:13.032018

As we move toward 2026, flying is set to undergo some of its most noticeable transformations in decades. From biometric boarding to greener aircraft and redesigned cabins, the way passengers experience air travel is evolving rapidly. What once felt futuristic is becoming routine, and 2026 is expected to mark a turning point in how we fly.

Biometric Travel Will Become the New Normal

One of the biggest changes passengers will notice in 2026 is the widespread use of biometric identification. Facial recognition, already in use at select airports, will become standard for check-in, security, and boarding.

Instead of presenting passports and boarding passes multiple times, travelers will simply walk through checkpoints where cameras verify their identity in seconds. This will reduce queues, speed up boarding, and minimize physical contact—something travelers now value more than ever.

Airports aim to become “walk-through” experiences, where your face becomes your boarding pass.

Shorter Airport Wait Times Through AI and Automation

Artificial intelligence will play a major role in reducing delays. AI-powered systems will predict congestion, adjust staff deployment, and optimize flight schedules in real time. Security scanners will become smarter, requiring fewer manual checks while maintaining safety standards.

Robotic assistants may also appear more frequently—guiding passengers, answering questions, and even helping with luggage in large terminals. For frequent flyers, this means less stress and more predictability.

Greener Aircraft and Sustainable Flying

Sustainability is no longer optional for the aviation industry. By 2026, airlines are expected to significantly increase their use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

Newer aircraft models will be lighter, quieter, and more fuel-efficient. Some airlines may begin limited electric or hybrid-electric flights on short regional routes. While fully electric long-haul flights are still years away, 2026 will represent a major step toward eco-conscious aviation.

Passengers may also see carbon-footprint labels on tickets, allowing them to make more informed travel choices.

Cabin Design Will Focus on Comfort and Personal Space

The days of one-size-fits-all cabin layouts are fading. In 2026, aircraft interiors will prioritize ergonomics, hygiene, and personalization.

Seats will feature better lumbar support, adjustable headrests, and smart cushions that adapt to body movement. Improved air filtration systems will enhance cabin air quality, while antimicrobial materials will become standard on high-touch surfaces.

Economy class may see subtle but meaningful upgrades, while premium cabins will offer more privacy through sliding doors and quieter spaces—even on mid-range flights.

In-Flight Entertainment Will Be Personalized

Seatback screens will no longer be the primary entertainment source. Instead, airlines will integrate personal device streaming, allowing passengers to watch content on their own phones, tablets, or laptops.

AI-driven systems will recommend movies, music, and even destination tips based on passenger preferences. High-speed satellite Wi-Fi will become more reliable, enabling video calls, live streaming, and remote work at 35,000 feet.

For business travelers, flights in 2026 may feel more like mobile offices than downtime.

Faster, More Flexible Booking and Pricing

Dynamic pricing powered by AI will allow airlines to offer more personalized fares. Ticket prices may vary not just by demand, but by loyalty status, travel history, and flexibility preferences.

Passengers will also enjoy more modular booking options—paying only for what they need. Want extra legroom but no checked baggage? Prefer flexible dates but basic seating? By 2026, customization will be key.

Health and Wellness Will Matter More

Airlines are paying closer attention to passenger well-being. Expect better cabin lighting to reduce jet lag, healthier in-flight meals, and hydration-focused services on long-haul routes.

Some airlines may introduce quiet zones or wellness-focused seating areas, acknowledging the growing demand for mindful travel experiences.

Conclusion: Flying in 2026 Will Feel Smarter, Not Just Faster

Traveling by plane in 2026 won’t just be about reaching a destination—it will be about how smoothly, responsibly, and comfortably you get there. Technology will reduce friction, sustainability will guide decisions, and personalization will shape every stage of the journey.

While the romance of flying remains, the experience itself is becoming more human-centered. In many ways, the future of air travel isn’t about machines—it’s about making flying work better for people.

As these changes take flight, passengers can expect a journey that feels less like a hassle and more like a seamless part of modern life.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/694f8ec13a9508001ec547e5.jpg",N,,2025-12-27 19:56:20.061234

Airline SAF Targets Under Pressure The slow expansion of SAF production is already forcing airlines to reconsider their climate commitments.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has released updated estimates for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, revealing a mixed picture for aviation’s decarbonisation efforts.

Global SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (2.4 billion litres) in 2025, nearly double the 1 million tonnes produced in 2024.

However, growth is projected to slow in 2026, with production rising to just 2.4 million tonnes, highlighting the challenges facing scale-up. Even at these levels, SAF will account for only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, inching up to 0.8% in 2026—far short of what is needed to meaningfully cut aviation emissions.

High Costs and Weak Policy Support Stall Momentum

IATA has revised its 2025 SAF outlook downward from earlier forecasts, citing insufficient and poorly designed policy support. Despite installed production capacity, SAF output has failed to accelerate due to a lack of effective incentives.

At current prices, SAF costs around twice as much as conventional jet fuel, and in markets with mandates, prices can rise to five times higher. For airlines, this translates into an additional USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs in 2025 alone.

“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. “But if the objective is to scale SAF production and decarbonise aviation, then regulators must rethink their approach.”

EU and UK Mandates: Rising Prices, Limited Supply

According to IATA, SAF mandates in Europe and the UK have failed to deliver the intended boost to production and adoption.

Under the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation framework, airlines face sharply higher costs amid limited SAF supply and concentrated fuel markets. In some cases, airlines are paying up to five times the cost of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF, without guaranteed supply or consistent certification.

Similarly, the UK’s SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the financial burden. In total, airlines paid a USD 2.9 billion premium for the limited SAF available in 2025—of which USD 1.4 billion reflects the standard SAF price gap over fossil fuel.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment and undermine efforts to scale SAF,” Walsh warned, calling for urgent course correction beyond policy announcements.

Airline SAF Targets Under Pressure

The slow expansion of SAF production is already forcing airlines to reconsider their climate commitments. Many carriers that pledged to use 10% SAF by 2030 may be unable to meet those targets due to supply constraints.

“These commitments were made in good faith,” Walsh said, “but SAF is simply not being produced in sufficient quantities to deliver on that ambition.”

The Risk of Repeating Mistakes with e-SAF

Looking ahead, IATA has cautioned regulators against repeating the same errors as e-SAF mandates approach—scheduled for 2028 in the UK and 2030 in the EU.

E-SAF faces an even steeper cost challenge, with prices potentially up to 12 times higher than conventional jet fuel. Without strong production incentives, IATA warns that supply will fall well short of targets, potentially pushing compliance costs to EUR 29 billion by 2032.

“Current policies are clearly not delivering the desired outcomes,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist. “Mandates have driven up costs and constrained supply. Repeating the same approach with e-SAF would be a serious mistake.”

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released new estimates for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production showing that:

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (Mt) (2.4 billion liters), double the 1 Mt produced in 2024. However, in 2026, SAF production growth is projected to slow down and reach 2.4 Mt.

SAF production in 2025 represents only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption, increasing to 0.8% the following year. At current price levels, the SAF premium translates into an additional USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs for the industry in 2025.

The estimated SAF output for 2025 of 1.9 Mt is a downward revision from IATA’s earlier forecasts due to lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities. SAF prices exceed fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to a factor of five in mandated markets.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonization of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

The Negative Effects of EU & UK SAF Mandates

Mandates in the EU and UK have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption:

In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have widened their profit margins to such an extent that airlines pay up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF. All this comes without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation.

The UK’s SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden.

The cumulative impact of poorly designed policy frameworks is that airlines paid a premium of USD 2.9 billion for the limited 1.9 Mt of SAF available in 2025. Of this, USD 1.4 billion reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional fuel.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognize that its approach is not working and urgently correct course. The recent European Commission STIP announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter,” said Walsh.

The failure to accelerate the expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets. “Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10% SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” said Walsh.

Looking Ahead to e-SAF Mandates

With e-SAF mandates approaching in the UK (2028) and EU (2030), it’s essential not to repeat the policy missteps seen with SAF.

Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel. Without strong production incentives (as opposed to mandates), supply will fall short of targets. On top of that, compliance costs could escalate to EUR 29 billion by 2032 if targets aren’t met, as seems very likely with the current policy framework.

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect. Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down. Mandates have done just the opposite, and it is outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist.",https://thevoiceofchandigarh.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/fuel-200x200.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 11:56:47.994840

While people still sought holidays, new experiences, and memorable photos, there was a noticeable shift in the way travelers approached their trips. As the world faced increasingly severe climate events like heatwaves and floods, travelers began to prioritize sustainability over convenience. Climate awareness grew louder, and more people began to consider the environmental impact of their travel choices. What once was a buzzword, sustainability became a deciding factor for travelers when booking flights, choosing accommodations, and planning their activities.

In 2025, the mindset surrounding travel began to change quietly but significantly. The conversation shifted from where should I go to how can I travel responsibly? This article highlights how greener travel practices have emerged as the new norm in 2025 and the pivotal changes that marked this shift toward sustainable travel.

The Personal Shift: Why Travelers Began to Care More

In 2025, climate conversations felt more personal than ever before. Global environmental changes, including heatwaves, floods, and unpredictable weather, made it clear how much human activities—including tourism—affect the planet. Reports from organizations like the UN World Tourism Organization and the World Economic Forum highlighted the tourism sector’s carbon footprint, and this led many travelers to pay attention.

Rather than simply asking where should I go, travelers increasingly began to question, how can I travel responsibly? This question signified a turning point in the travel industry. It marked the moment when conscious travel became mainstream, no longer confined to niche eco-travel groups. More people started considering their travel choices and how they could reduce their environmental impact.

Slow Travel: A Key Trend of 2025

One of the most significant changes in 2025 was the rise of slow travel. Travelers, instead of rushing through several cities in a short period, began opting for longer stays in one destination. Slow travel emphasizes quality experiences over quantity, and it allows travelers to better understand and immerse themselves in local culture and nature.

This trend was largely driven by the increasing desire to minimize carbon footprints and enjoy meaningful experiences without the haste of ticking off items on a travel list. As part of this shift, train journeys became especially popular, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia. Trains are known for their lower emissions compared to flights, and they also offer scenic views, making the journey itself part of the travel experience.

Night trains and long-distance rail travel were marketed as experiences rather than compromises, and many travelers embraced this sustainable option for both leisure and transportation. Studies from the European Environment Agency consistently show that train travel produces far fewer emissions than flying, and in 2025, more people began to listen and incorporate this sustainable choice into their travels.

Hotels Going Beyond Towel Reuse: Sustainability in Accommodations

In 2025, sustainable hotels began to move past the basic “reuse your towel” sign. Eco-certifications like Green Key and LEED became more prominent, and hotels made them front and center in their marketing. The trend toward sustainability led to refillable toiletry stations replacing tiny plastic shampoo bottles, and hotels worked to reduce single-use plastics wherever possible.

Boutique accommodations embraced local sourcing, from furniture made by local artisans to farm-to-table menus that emphasized fresh, locally grown produce. These small changes helped reduce waste, lowered the carbon footprint of travel, and supported local communities. In 2025, travelers increasingly chose accommodations based on their environmental practices, ensuring their stays aligned with their values of sustainability and responsible travel.

Flights Getting Cleaner: Aviation’s Shift Toward Sustainability

Aviation is one of the largest contributors to travel-related emissions, but 2025 saw significant strides in making air travel more sustainable. Many airlines began to incorporate Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into their operations, which can significantly reduce carbon emissions compared to traditional jet fuel.

Reports from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and other industry leaders show that airlines also invested in fuel-efficient aircraft that burn less fuel per passenger. This shift was complemented by the increased availability of carbon offset programs, which encouraged travelers to take responsibility for their emissions by contributing to forest restoration and renewable energy projects. Travelers were given the opportunity to offset their flight’s emissions at the time of booking, increasing awareness of the true cost of flying.

Community-Based Travel Gains Popularity

Community-based travel became a major trend in 2025 as travelers sought out more authentic experiences that benefited local communities. Rather than staying in large hotel chains, more travelers opted for homestays, local tours, and experiences run by locals. According to data from Booking.com and Airbnb, searches for accommodations that benefited local communities saw significant growth. This form of tourism helped ensure that money stayed within communities, traditions were respected, and tourism was less extractive and more meaningful.

By choosing local businesses, travelers contributed directly to the well-being of the communities they visited, helping to sustain cultural heritage and support the local economy. This form of travel, which places an emphasis on cultural exchange and community support, became increasingly important in 2025.

Technology Helping Travelers Make Greener Choices

In 2025, technology played a critical role in helping travelers make more informed choices about their trips. Many travel platforms and apps provided carbon impact labels for flights and accommodations, allowing travelers to compare the environmental footprint of their options. Apps also made it easier for travelers to find sustainable hotels, public transport routes, and low-impact activities.

These platforms provided data-backed transparency, empowering travelers to make responsible decisions without feeling overwhelmed. With the rise of eco-consciousness in the travel sector, these tools helped travelers take action toward more sustainable journeys.

Conclusion: Sustainable Travel is Here to Stay

In 2025, the travel industry made significant strides toward sustainability, with greener choices becoming the norm rather than the exception. From slow travel and sustainable accommodations to cleaner flights and community-based tourism, travelers and industry leaders alike embraced the idea that tourism must coexist with nature and local cultures.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-105.png,N,,2025-12-27 09:56:28.985740

Travel in 2025 came with a very different mindset. People still wanted holidays, photos, and new experiences — but they also wanted cleaner air, lighter footprints, and fewer guilt pangs while booking that flight. Sustainability stopped being a buzzword and quietly became a deciding factor. From airlines to hotels to the way travellers planned their trips, travel truly began to think greener. Here’s how travel slowly changed course in 2025.

Why Travellers Started Caring More

In 2025, climate conversations felt more personal. Heatwaves, floods, and unpredictable weather made people more aware of how travel affects the planet. Reports from organisations like the UN World Tourism Organisation and World Economic Forum highlighted tourism’s carbon footprint, and travellers began paying attention. Instead of asking “Where should I go?”, many people first asked “How can I go responsibly?” This shift marked the beginning of conscious travel becoming mainstream rather than niche.

Slow Travel Took Centre Stage

One of the biggest changes was how people travelled, not just where. Slow travel became a preferred choice. Instead of rushing through five cities in seven days, travellers stayed longer in one place. Train journeys gained popularity, especially in Europe and parts of Asia. Train journeys offer both lower emissions and scenic routes that travellers loved. Night trains and long-distance rail travel were marketed as experiences rather than compromises. Studies by the European Environment Agency consistently show trains produce far fewer emissions than flights — and travellers finally listened.

Hotels Went Beyond Towel Reuse

In 2025, sustainable hotels moved past the old “reuse your towel” sign. They leaned into eco-certifications like Green Key and LEED, and made those badges front and center for guests. No more tiny plastic shampoo bottles—hotels swapped in refillable toiletry stations and cut down single-use plastics wherever they could. Many boutique stays highlighted local sourcing — from furniture made by local artisans to farm-to-table menus.

Flights Became Cleaner

Aviation has always been a big source of travel-related emissions, but 2025 saw visible efforts to improve. Many airlines expanded the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can cut carbon emissions significantly compared to regular jet fuel. According to IATA and industry reports, airlines also invested in newer, fuel-efficient aircraft that burn less fuel per passenger. Carbon offset options were no longer hidden at checkout. Travellers were encouraged to offset emissions by supporting forest restoration and renewable energy projects, making people more aware of the real cost of flying.

Community-Based Travel Got Popular

At the same time, community-based travel really took off. More travelers picked homestays over chains, booked tours with local guides, and looked for experiences run by people who actually lived there. Reports from Booking.com and Airbnb show a jump in searches for stays that benefitted locals instead of big chains. This meant money stayed within communities, traditions were respected, and tourism felt less extractive and more meaningful.

The fight to protect livelihoods isn’t just about markets and margins, it’s also about mental health and the well-being of farm families.
Brad Olson is President of the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation","Farmers faced a year of tight margins, falling markets and rising costs in 2025. These pressures aren’t just economic; they’re taking a toll on farmer’s mental health, as well. The farm economy isn’t something we simply live with anymore; it’s becoming a crisis that weighs on families and communities. Yet farmers kept moving forward planting, harvesting, advocating and sustaining rural life.

In light of the pain points, this year delivered bright spots worth noting both in Wisconsin Farm Bureau and across Wisconsin agriculture.

Wisconsin Farm Bureau earned national recognition, bringing home the New Horizon Award for Gather Wisconsin and the Pinnacle Award, the highest honor from American Farm Bureau Federation. These achievements reflect the strength of organized agriculture and its ability to connect farmers with consumers and policymakers.

Membership surpassed 53,000 for the first time since 1993. That momentum came from grassroots efforts proving that collective action has an impact.

There were several policy wins for farmers worth noting this year, as well. With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Dairy Margin Coverage eligibility increased to 6 million pounds, offering better protection for milk producers. A biannual cost survey for cheese processors will improve transparency in make allowance calculations, and reference prices rose to $10.00 for soybeans and $4.10 for corn. Livestock producers secured full reimbursement for predation losses, and the Market Access Program received $400 million to expand global marketing opportunities.

Two major policy wins at the end of this year reinforce the connection between agriculture and everyday life. The Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act passed with strong bipartisan support, restoring the option for schools to serve whole milk. This change reflects years of advocacy by farmers who know the nutritional value of milk and the importance of giving students access to the products Wisconsin is proud to produce.

Another milestone came recently with the passage of the Pet and Livestock Protection Act in the House. This legislation is an important step toward restoring common-sense wildlife management and providing certainty for rural communities that have lived with the consequences of a growing wolf population for far too long. Both of these measures show what can happen when grassroots voices and legislative action align.

At the state level, the budget supported rural infrastructure, processing capacity, conservation and farmer wellness. The Agricultural Road Improvement Program returned with $150 million for roads and bridges, reinforcing the importance of safe and reliable transportation for farm products.

Grassroots advocacy proved its strength when proposed fee hikes for markets and trucking were rolled back after nearly 600 comments from farmers.

While there is plenty to celebrate, there are still persistent challenges that need to be recognized in farming.

Commodity prices remained under pressure from heavy carryover stocks and weaker export demand. Fertilizer and equipment costs stayed high, and interest rates pushed borrowing costs upward. Analysts estimate U.S. farmers will lose $15 billion selling this year’s corn, with combined crop losses reaching $54 billion over the past three years. These numbers reflect a trend that weighs heavily on farm profitability and long-term sustainability.

Health care coverage continues to be one of the most persistent challenges for farm families. Rising premiums and limited rural provider networks make affordable options hard to find. Many farmers are self-employed, which often means paying for individual plans with high deductibles or going without coverage altogether. In some cases, families rely on off-farm employment just to access insurance, creating added stress and financial strain through the form of daycare expenses and additional farm labor.

These realities highlight the need for health plans tailored to agriculture, which is why Wisconsin Farm Bureau is currently advocating for legislation that would allow us to offer Farm Bureau Health Plans for our members.

The financial strains in farming have also amplified mental health concerns. DATCP’s Farm Center reported record call volumes and doubled its client load in September. While sobering, these figures show progress as more farmers are reaching out for help rather than suffering in silence. To help farmers get acclimated with mental health resources, Wisconsin Farm Bureau’s Farm Neighbors Care Program distributed over 12,000 stickers, wallet cards and wristbands in the past year to remind farmers that support is available and that no one faces these challenges alone.

The coming year will demand resilience and collaboration. Stabilizing trade relationships and expanding domestic markets remain priorities, with opportunities emerging in biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel. Continued engagement with policymakers will be essential to secure fair pricing, sensible regulations and strong safety nets for farmers.

Wisconsin agriculture has proven its strength through adversity, but resilience comes at a cost. The fight to protect livelihoods isn’t just about markets and margins, it’s also about mental health and the well-being of farm families. Every conversation matters. Every check-in matters.

When farmers unite, whether to push back on harmful regulations, advocate for better policies or simply support one another, they do more than survive tough seasons. They build a future where farming is sustainable for both the land and the people who care for it.

The challenges ahead are real, but so is the determination to keep moving forward together.

Ensuring universal access to clean cooking fuel remained central. Under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, beneficiary coverage reached about 10.35 crore households by December 1, 2025.

""Turning everyday trash into jet fuel could be an innovative but major near-term step toward cleaner aviation.
By converting municipal waste into low-carbon jet fuel that already works in today's engines, we can start cutting emissions immediately, without waiting for future technology.""
First, it would reduce air pollution by 80-90% compared with traditional aviation fuel.
""Efficiency could be improved by capturing carbon dioxide or adding green hydrogen, produced with renewable power, during processing,"" Space Daily stated.","As the booming airline industry looks for ways to reduce its impact on the planet, researchers revealed that sustainable aviation fuel could be produced from municipal solid waste.

The study, published in Nature Sustainability, said such a program could meet 28% of global jet fuel demand and lessen air pollution by 16%, Space Daily reported.

Sustainable aviation fuel, which the outlet described as ""a low-carbon alternative made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and crops,"" is not the only way innovators are looking to revamp environmentally costly flights. One group is turning back the clock with a propeller design to reduce fuel burn, and another is transforming microalgae into biofuel.

Still, less than 1% of global jet fuel use comes from sustainable fuels, Space Daily noted, adding that aviation accounts for 2.5% of worldwide pollution and that air travel will double by 2040. (Other options are plentiful.)

""Unlike road transport, which is quickly shifting toward electrification, there's no silver-bullet solution for achieving carbon-neutral aviation,"" first author Jingran Zhang said. ""Turning everyday trash into jet fuel could be an innovative but major near-term step toward cleaner aviation. By converting municipal waste into low-carbon jet fuel that already works in today's engines, we can start cutting emissions immediately, without waiting for future technology.""

Turning trash into fuel would have major benefits. First, it would reduce air pollution by 80-90% compared with traditional aviation fuel. It would also convert plastic, metal, and other garbage into an important product, replacing the need to store those unwanted goods in landfills or burn them. That would produce clean energy, herald the arrival of zero-waste goals, lessen pollution, and conserve land, according to Space Daily.

One problem with the idea is that only one-third of the trash was converted into fuel due to ""gas composition mismatches,"" the website pointed out. The researchers said adding carbon dioxide or green hydrogen to the mix would boost the effort.

""Efficiency could be improved by capturing carbon dioxide or adding green hydrogen, produced with renewable power, during processing,"" Space Daily stated.

The economic benefits would include savings for airlines that already gain from government incentives and subsidies that encourage the use of more environmentally friendly fuels. The United States and Europe have said they will greatly reduce aviation pollution by using sustainable fuels, with the latter to move from a 2% share this year to a 70% share by 2050.

""Broad collaboration among governments, fuel producers, airlines, and aircraft manufacturers will be essential to increase production, lower costs, and accelerate aviation's path to net-zero emissions,"" lead author Michael B.

Promising new receiver-reactor concepts with multiple apertures have been proposed for high temperature solar thermochemical hydrogen production. However, limited information about suitable solar concentrator designs consisting of heliostat fields and secondary concentrators is available so far.

The goal of this study is a detailed investigation of the effect of selected solar concentrator design parameters on its performance. For a 10 MW receiver-reactor the number of subfields and corresponding apertures is varied in combination with the receiver height above the ground, the acceptance angle of the secondary concentrator, and the design point flux density. In addition, the performance is analyzed at different power levels. The average annual performance is evaluated as well as the hourly behavior. The latter of which is important to quantify the performance of a plant with an integrated receiver-reactor.

For the heliostat field layout the program HFLCAL1 is used. Solar concentrator designs with annual average efficiencies of over 60% are identified delivering flux densities of up to 5000 suns at design point for 10 MW receivers. Instead of a joint evaluation of the solar concentrator together with a specific receiver-reactor a generic receiver-reactor surrogate model is introduced. With this surrogate model an hourly analysis of the plant performance is conducted and a parametrized correction factor is presented to derive more accurate yearly plant performance estimates.

The study provides detailed information on solar concentrators using multiple heliostat subfields and central tower systems with secondary optics, and indicates further optimization potential of solar concentrators for high-temperature receivers.

A New Base and a Strengthened Offer for 2026, Serving Improved Regional Connectivity Present in Montpellier since 2012, Volotea has offered more than 3 million seats from the airport.
The opening of the new base in autumn 2026 is the next step in supporting this growth and strengthening Volotea’s local presence.
I would like to thank the teams at Montpellier–Méditerranée Airport for their close cooperation,” said Carlos Muñoz, Founder and CEO of Volotea.
The network developed by Volotea’s base will complement the low-fare offer already provided by our airline partners operating from Montpellier,” said Emmanuel Brehmer, Chairman of the Executive Board of Montpellier Méditerranée Airport.","Volotea has announced the upcoming opening of its new base in Montpellier, its 20th in Europe and 11th in France. This represents a significant step in Volotea’s continued expansion across France and reflects the airline’s long-standing commitment to Montpellier since the launch of operations there in 2012.

A New Base and a Strengthened Offer for 2026, Serving Improved Regional Connectivity

Present in Montpellier since 2012, Volotea has offered more than 3 million seats from the airport. In 2025, the airline operates eight routes and is offering its highest-ever capacity in the region, with more than 370,000 seats.

The opening of the new base in autumn 2026 is the next step in supporting this growth and strengthening Volotea’s local presence. From launch, the airline will base an Airbus A320, creating around 30 direct jobs and more than 170 indirect jobs, while increasing capacity and expanding the flight program. This further reinforces Volotea’s contribution to the local economy in the Hérault region.

From autumn 2026, Volotea will offer passengers from Montpellier four new destinations:

Bordeaux: From November 6th, with two flights per week (Fridays and Sundays), passengers will be able to travel to Bordeaux, France’s wine capital and a UNESCO World Heritage-listed city.

Madrid: Also launching on November 6th, with two weekly frequencies (Mondays and Fridays), Volotea will provide access to Spain’s capital.

Tenerife South: From November 8th, with one weekly flight (Sundays), passengers will be able to travel to Tenerife South, a year-round sunny destination in the Canary Islands.

Lanzarote: From November 7th, with one weekly frequency (Saturdays), Volotea will launch a new route to Lanzarote, a Canary Island renowned for its unique volcanic scenery and an aesthetic shaped by artist César Manrique.

These new routes, already available for sale on Volotea’s website, complement an existing network of eight destinations (Ajaccio, Brest, Caen, Lille, Nantes, Rennes, Strasbourg and Menorca) to France and Spain, and align with the airline’s development strategy in Montpellier.

“We are very pleased to confirm Montpellier as our 11th base in France and 20th in Europe, more than 13 years after operating our first flight here. This is a landmark moment that reaffirms our local roots, as Montpellier becomes our fourth base in the Occitanie region, following Toulouse, Rodez and Lourdes. It reflects our ambition to strengthen connectivity between Europe’s small and mid-sized cities and to position ourselves as a key regional player in France. From autumn 2026, our four new routes, Bordeaux, Madrid, Tenerife South and Lanzarote, will further enhance an already dynamic offer. We are already working to expand our network with additional capacity and destinations. I would like to thank the teams at Montpellier–Méditerranée Airport for their close cooperation,” said Carlos Muñoz, Founder and CEO of Volotea.

“This is an important day for Montpellier and the surrounding region. Volotea has been a strategic airline for more than 13 years and has played a major role in connecting eastern Occitanie with France’s regional capitals. The arrival of the first based aircraft in autumn 2026 will enable the launch of four new destinations and marks a new phase of development for our airport. From 2027, Volotea will strengthen existing transversal routes and add further destinations to our network. This represents a strong growth driver for eastern Occitanie, addressing the travel needs of all customer segments. The network developed by Volotea’s base will complement the low-fare offer already provided by our airline partners operating from Montpellier,” said Emmanuel Brehmer, Chairman of the Executive Board of Montpellier Méditerranée Airport.

Volotea, Leading Provider Of Domestic Connectivity In France

With 8 million seats offered in 2025 (+8% versus 2024), Volotea continues to strengthen its presence in France, its largest market, and plans to increase capacity to 9 million seats in 2026, representing a 12.5% increase year-on-year. The airline has carried more than 7.3 million",https://www.rustourismnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Volotea.webp,N,,2025-12-26 22:11:49.202967

Smart technologies, such as 5G connectivity, real-time IoT monitoring and Digi Yatra-enabled contactless processing, place it firmly in the next generation of global airports.

For the first time, a metropolitan city in the country will operate with two full-fledged international airports, a distinction that places Mumbai in the league of global megacities that plan not just for today’s needs but for tomorrow’s aspirations. The new airport is a statement in steel, glass, and concrete—and also in confidence. Conceived decades ago and delayed repeatedly by land acquisition issues and environmental concerns, the NMIA has finally taken wing. Credit must go to the Adani Group for delivering the project as promised, overcoming bureaucratic inertia and logistical challenges that have stalled many such ventures in the past. In an era where deadlines are often elastic, timely delivery matters.

What had caught public imagination even before the first passengers walked through its terminals was the airport’s striking design. The giant terminal complex, shaped like a multi-petalled lotus, is both symbolic and functional. The lotus occupies a special place in Indian culture—representing purity, renewal, and continuity. In contemporary political shorthand, it is also the election symbol of the ruling BJP. While some may read political meaning into the design, the more enduring interpretation lies in its civilisational resonance and architectural elegance. Infrastructure, after all, should outlast governments and slogans. By the way, the house of worship the Bahais built in New Delhi is known more as the Lotus Temple.

Beyond aesthetics, the NMIA is unapologetically futuristic. Designed initially to handle 20 million passengers annually, it has the potential to scale up to an impressive 90 million in later phases. Smart technologies, such as 5G connectivity, real-time IoT monitoring and Digi Yatra-enabled contactless processing, place it firmly in the next generation of global airports. Its advanced Category II Instrument Landing System will allow operations even in poor visibility, a critical advantage during Mumbai’s monsoons and winter fog. Equally significant is the emphasis on sustainability. With plans for 47 MW of solar power generation, dedicated Sustainable Aviation Fuel storage and electric buses for ground connectivity, the NMIA aligns with the global push towards greener aviation. Its proximity to the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and dedicated cargo terminals positions it as a logistics hub, not merely a passenger gateway.

Politically, the airport reinforces the Modi government’s strong focus on infrastructure—airports, highways, and ports—as engines of economic growth. The dual-airport strategy will ease pressure on the ageing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport and future-proof the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. If efficiently managed and equitably integrated into the city’s transport network, the NMIA could do more than decongest Mumbai; it could redefine how India builds, connects, and imagines its urban future.",https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2025-06-30/w5l0hfev/Nanobot-1-11.jpg,N,,2025-12-26 22:11:52.564087
