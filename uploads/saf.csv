Aviation contributes a meaningful share of global climate forcing and its fuel demand is expected to grow substantially toward mid-century. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is widely viewed as the most practical near-term decarbonization lever for long-haul fleets because it can be blended with Jet A-1 and used within existing aircraft and airport infrastructure. This review synthesizes the state of SAF feedstocks and conversion routes, spanning lipid-based hydroprocessing (HEFA), gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FT), Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), and emerging Power-to-Liquid (PtL) e-fuels produced from CO₂ and renewable hydrogen. We compare indicative yields, lifecycle greenhouse-gas performance, and cost drivers, and we summarize policy and certification enablers including CORSIA and the EU Fit for 55 package.

“This partnership with the GFI is a vital step in demonstrating the commercial viability of SAF projects in the UK,” said Dr. Amy Ruddock, Director, Willis Sustainable Fuels.","Willis Sustainable Fuels UK Limited, a subsidiary of Willis Lease Finance Corporation and the Green Finance Institute, an independent advisor to governments and investors, have announced a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Project Accelerator to bring WSF’s pioneering SAF project at Wilton International in Teesside to Final Investment Decision (FID) and establish a replicable blueprint for financing new homegrown transition projects.

Since the start of 2025, the UK’s SAF mandate requires increasing levels of SAF in the UK’s jet fuel supply to reach 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040.[1] Under the mandate, the economic, energy-security and innovation benefits of expanding domestic SAF production are compelling. This policy stability provides a strong, long-term demand signal to accelerate SAF growth, but the challenge remains in reaching bankability.

WSF’s Teesside project is one of the UK’s most advanced second-generation SAF projects, using existing, proven technology to make SAF from waste. Targeting 14,000 tonnes of production per year, the project supports national energy security, by reducing reliance on imported fuels and anchors new green-industry jobs in the Northeast, by converting mainly UK biomethane into next-generation jet fuel. This project has been funded £7.6 million through two rounds of the UK Government’s Advanced Fuels Fund.

Before committing capital to transactions in this nascent sector, financiers need to address risks including technology performance, feedstock, and price/revenue certainty. While the UK mandate provides strong long-term demand certainty, developers need to assemble a complex mix of public and private de-risking tools to meet these requirements.

With a track record of mobilising £77 billion in committed capital to drive the transition and as a key adviser in shaping the UK’s SAF mandate, GFI’s SAF programme will focus on helping leading projects reach FID in 2026. The “accelerator” platform is designed to remove financing barriers and develop solutions that attract private sector investment into pioneering projects.

Key objectives of the accelerator include:

Developing innovative financing and de-risking strategies for SAF infrastructure.

Identifying regulatory and financial gaps that, if addressed, could enable advanced SAF projects to reach FID and deliver volumes aligned with the UK SAF Mandate.

Convening private- and public-sector market participants to develop solutions that address bankability gaps.

Establishing a replicable model for turning policy ambition into built, investable clean-energy infrastructure as a number of UK projects seek to reach FID in the coming year.

“This partnership with the GFI is a vital step in demonstrating the commercial viability of SAF projects in the UK,” said Dr. Amy Ruddock, Director, Willis Sustainable Fuels. “Together, we aim to create a blueprint for financing solutions that will accelerate the transition to low-carbon aviation.”

“Our collaboration with WSF exemplifies how strategic partnerships across the value chain can unlock investment for innovative technologies,” said Dr. Rhian-Mari Thomas, CEO at GFI. “By launching this accelerator approach, we aim to scale SAF production to support the UK’s ambitions for a homegrown SAF industry.”

Both organisations will also collaborate on communicating best practice and lessons learned from this process to raise visibility for SAF financing solutions within the UK’s transition finance ecosystem.",https://ethicalmarketingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cropped-twitter-logo-32x32.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 21:56:37.190230

The Asian continent has been identified as a major driver in the biofuel production sector as several nations aim to enter the sector for the first time or expand existing operations to meet an increase in demand from the international market. Now, a leading Malaysian energy company has outlined its plans to pivot towards the sector in 2026, marking a shift in the conventional energy market.

Indonesia plans a gradual shift to biodiesel production in 2026

Several industry experts have noted the role that Asia will play in diversifying the energy market in 2026, with Indonesia planning to implement a gradual shift to biodiesel production this year.

Indonesia’s government is planning a concept to produce biodiesel up to B100 as part of its efforts to diversify its biofuel production sector. At the moment, biofuel diesel is required to consist of 35 percent fatty acid methyl esters from palm oil and 65 percent diesel fuel under the government’s directive. However, the Indonesian officials have plans to gradually increase that number over time.

“We are preparing concepts up to B100, but this will be done gradually. We will report the developments in due time.” – Indonesian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Bahlil Lahadalia

Indonesia’s government is preparing for a surge in biofuel usage in 2026 and beyond

The government has noted its intention to construct various supporting infrastructures, including ports, shipping, and logistics, to ensure a smooth, gradual roll-out of the new mandated percentages of bio-feedstock. Industry experts and analysts all point to the Asia continent playing an integral role in the energy transition to the biofuel sector.

Malaysia is planning to boost bio-feedstock production in the new year

Malaysia is following the trend that has emerged in Indonesia to develop a more welcoming environment for bio-feedstock production this year, as the government has noted the opportunity to become a key player in the global shift towards sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

Cathay Pacific, a global leader in sustainability projects, has committed to pivoting its focus to developing the bio-feedstock sector in the nation. Several industry analysts have noted the important role that Asia will play in diversifying the energy market in the new year, such as International Air Transport Association (IATA) director general Willie Walsh.

“All of these countries have an opportunity to provide feedstock that can be used for the development of sustainable fuels. It’s not just for air transport, it’s also for road transport. When we look at Asia and Southeast Asia, we see lots of feedstock opportunities there. So, there’s an opportunity to develop a whole new industry, generate employment, reduce dependence on importing oil, and create a positive outcome for the environment as well. – International Air Transport Association (IATA) director general Willie Walsh

Reshaping the global energy market to expand alternative energy development options will be key in the coming years, as the slow phasing out of oil and gas production enters a new era.

Despite the clear promotion of biofuels in Asia, the conventional upstream sector is still dominating the sector

Asia’s potential in the biofuel industry aside, the conventional upstream energy sector will continue to play a vital role in meeting the expected increase in energy demand that has been reported across several regions of the world. With PETRONAS reaching a major development step in South America recently, the traditional oil and gas sector is not going anywhere anytime soon. Asia will no doubt become a leader in the biofuel sector in 2026, but can the region continue on its path to diversify its energy sector beyond 2026?",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Depositphotos_647886398_XL-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 17:12:21.432122

Looking ahead, United Airlines and Azul are likely to expand their influence in the region. As regional connectivity grows and demand for air travel increases in South America, the partnership will likely lead to more direct routes and expanded services, enhancing both domestic and international travel options for tourists and business travelers.

With United Airlines already having a strong presence in Latin America, this partnership will make it easier for US passengers to connect to Brazilian destinations, and vice versa. The increased accessibility to key South American hubs, combined with the expanded network, will contribute to the future growth of the tourism sector and the aviation industry in both Brazil and the United States.

Moreover, as Latin American tourism continues to rise, the collaboration between United Airlines and Azul will ensure that both airlines remain competitive and well-positioned to meet the increasing demand for international and domestic flights in the region. This will also boost tourism revenue, particularly in Brazil, which has already seen growing interest from tourists around the world.

A Growing Focus on Sustainable Aviation Practices

As both airlines continue to expand, they will likely place a growing emphasis on sustainability and environmentally responsible aviation practices. The aviation industry is increasingly moving towards eco-friendly solutions, including fuel-efficient aircraft, carbon offset programs, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

United Airlines, which has made sustainability a core component of its operations, will likely collaborate with Azul to incorporate more eco-friendly practices into their operations, helping both airlines contribute to global sustainability goals. This shift towards green aviation is expected to become a key growth factor in Latin America and global aviation, positioning United Airlines and Azul as leaders in sustainable travel.

A Bright Future for United Airlines and Azul’s Partnership

As United Airlines has been expanding its interest in Azul, these airlines are expected to take advantage of their bolstered partnership as they move to succeed in the future. Increased connectivity between Brazil and the United States, governments’ backing to restructure Azul, and future aircraft additions are expected to boost tourism between these two areas.

This strategic partnership is a testament to the increasing need for the collaborations of airlines globally. This is especially because it contributes to the economic development of the countries as well as the development of tourism. The future potential for both United Airlines and Azul is great, as they continue to play a crucial role in the Latin American aviation market.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/United-Airlines-Expands-Stake-in-Azul-to-Eight-Percent.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 15:12:15.382515

Artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally transforming so many areas of our lives, and aerospace is no exception. As the sector faces some significant challenges from increasing passenger demand, new environmental imperatives, and the addition of new airspace actors – such as unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) – we will see more and more AI driving advancements in safety, efficiency and sustainability.

The question, however, is no longer whether AI will transform aviation, but how it can be applied responsibly, especially as aerospace innovation accelerates at a pace and scale few sectors can match.

Applying AI to aerospace

Modern airspace is a high-stakes puzzle, with thousands of flights criss-crossing the globe daily and traditional air traffic management (ATM) systems currently straining under the load. AI offers critical solutions by enabling dynamic, real-time air traffic flow management. AI-driven algorithms optimise flight paths and sequencing, reducing delays and maximising airspace utilisation. These systems can also enhance resilience, supporting controllers and pilots with automated decision tools during disruptions, thereby improving safety margins.

Predictive maintenance is another significant area of advancement. Imagine knowing if a component will fail before it does. By analysing the multitude of sensor data from an aircraft system, predictive maintenance forecasts wear and tear, enabling airlines to act before problems ground their fleets. This approach reduces unscheduled downtime and operational costs and could be especially useful in areas where aircraft usage doesn’t follow a repeatable pattern – such as in military aircraft.

Aviation operations generate and require vast amounts of data, from weather pattern monitoring and flight plans to fuel usage and emission measurements. AI excels at processing this sort of information, transforming it into usable insights for both airlines and airports. Real-time weather integration enables dynamic rerouting around adverse conditions, enhancing passenger comfort and safety, as well as aircraft longevity. Predictive models can help anticipate congestion in airspace and airports, allowing for proactive traffic flow management that minimises delays and emissions.

Furthermore, AI-driven route optimisation also improves fuel efficiency by minimising unnecessary deviations and optimising flight profiles, supporting the industry’s sustainability goals. Enhanced collaboration and data sharing between airlines, airports, and network managers – facilitated by AI – creates greater shared situational awareness for all airspace users.

The influence of AI extends to emerging domains such as advanced air mobility (AAM) and urban air mobility (UAM). The integration of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and autonomous drones into existing airspace presents significant challenges across many areas of society. AI-enabled unmanned traffic management (UTM) systems could be essential for safely and efficiently managing large volumes of low-altitude operations.

Navigating the headwinds

However, it’s not all plain sailing, and increased automation certainly introduces challenges for the human-machine interface. Operators must maintain situational awareness and be prepared to intervene, much like cars with autopilot modes on the road. Regulatory frameworks still have some way to go to address certification and safety assurance for autonomous systems, ensuring oversight and accountability remain robust, without stifling this innovation.

As AI capabilities grow, the risk of over-reliance on machine outputs becomes more pronounced. Effective training on human-machine teaming is essential to ensure proper use and to build resilience in a potential scenario where automation fails. Crews must be able to manage unexpected behaviours and exercise manual control to ensure safe outcomes in any situation. Human factors and training will remain vital to air operations, with AI augmenting, not replacing, human expertise. In a similar light, there is a need to determine and define accountability in automated air operations, ensuring there is legal liability and accountability.

The cybersecurity of automated air platforms is paramount. The risk of a hostile takeover, either physically or digitally, of an automated aircraft should never be underestimated, similar to that of traditional surface vehicles. At perhaps a less mortal threat level, dataset poisoning or algorithmic sabotage could also play a role in future commercial competition or hostile action.

AI will prove to be a powerful enabler in civil aerospace, offering significant gains in efficiency, safety, and sustainability. This won’t be a simple or rapid transition and will rely on cooperation and collaboration throughout complex supply chains, air operation environments and jurisdictions. By embracing AI thoughtfully, the aerospace industry can achieve a future that is efficient, safe, equitable, and sustainable.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/iStock-1526986072.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 14:12:09.360967

The research house said that while the European Union and the United States have put in place mandatory measures to boost SAF use, Malaysia’s current blending targets remain voluntary and non-binding. This could leave the country in a position where it produces SAF for export without creating enough demand from its own airlines.

BIMB Securities pointed out that Malaysia’s policies lack clear requirements and firm timelines, which could delay adoption by domestic carriers and reduce the fuel’s competitiveness.

SAF, made by blending palm oil or used cooking oil with conventional jet fuel, is regarded by the aviation industry as one of the main ways to reduce carbon emissions from flying.

In the European Union, airlines must ensure that at least 2% of fuel used on departing flights is SAF from 2025, with the share set to rise to 20% by 2035 and 70% by 2050. In the United States, producers are offered tax incentives if they meet certain conditions.

Malaysia has also acknowledged the importance of SAF and has set a target to produce up to one million tonnes by 2027.

However, BIMB Securities said the biggest hurdle remains the high cost of SAF, which is estimated to be around three times more expensive than traditional jet fuel. Without subsidies, tax breaks or mandatory blending rules, airlines have little incentive to adopt it on a voluntary basis.

The research firm added that because airlines operate on thin margins, the price gap between SAF and conventional fuel has limited uptake, making stronger policy support necessary to encourage wider use.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SAF-Bioenergy.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 14:12:16.917280

Australia has now joined this shift, with the federal government announcing a major funding plan to support domestic production of low-carbon liquid fuels, following long-standing demands from the farming sector, reports Energies Media.

Under a new Clean Fuels Program, the government will invest AU$1.1 billion (around $732 million) in the biofuel sector over the next 10 years. The move marks a change in direction for Australia, which has historically relied on oil and gas exports, as more countries focus on cleaner fuel sources.

The government plans to begin construction of Australia’s first large-scale biofuel refinery in 2026. Funding under the decade-long program will be used to draw private investment into biofuels and related industries, with the aim of turning Australia into a key player in global biofuel production.

Agriculture is expected to be central to the strategy. Australia is a major producer of crops such as canola, sugarcane and sorghum, which are widely used in biofuel production worldwide. At present, most of these crops are exported, while the country imports much of its fuel.

For years, farmers have urged the government to invest in biofuels, arguing that Australia has both the land and resources to build a strong domestic industry. The new investment is being seen as a response to those calls and a step towards creating new markets for agricultural output.

In a government statement, officials said Australia’s advanced farming methods and access to renewable energy give it a strong advantage in producing cleaner fuels needed by aviation, shipping and heavy transport as countries work to cut emissions.

The government also said the biofuel push would complement growth in renewable energy and help build new industries.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the funding represents an early commitment to developing a new sector and ensuring Australia benefits economically from the global shift towards lower-emission energy.

As the global airfreight industry steps into 2026, the latest projections from IATA suggest a year defined by growth, sustainability, and recalibration. Airlines are expected to carry 71.6 million tonnes of cargo.

This bullish outlook comes on the back of a record-setting October 2025, when global air cargo demand rose 4.1 percent year-on-year, according to IATA. It marked the eighth consecutive month of growth, driven by strong intra-Asia, Middle East–Europe, and Europe–Asia lanes — even as the Asia–North America corridor remained under pressure due to U.S. tariff impacts.

At the regional level, African airlines posted the highest year-on-year growth at 16.6 percent, followed by Asia-Pacific at 8.3 percent and the Middle East at 5.7 percent. European carriers grew a stable 4.3 percent, while North America and Latin America both declined by 2.7 percent, reflecting ongoing trade route realignments.

“October’s performance shows how air cargo is enabling global supply chains to reconfigure in real time,” said IATA Director General Willie Walsh. “That’s crucial as we enter the Q4 peak season and prepare for a more fragmented demand environment in 2026.”

Indeed, fragmentation is one of the watchwords for the year ahead. Demand remains uneven across geographies, while cost pressures persist. Fuel prices rose 2.5 percent in October despite falling crude, and the global manufacturing PMI hovers just above the growth threshold. Export order sentiment, meanwhile, remains cautious.

Yet airlines are not standing still. IATA’s 2026 goals include $4.5 billion in SAF investment, $1.7 billion in climate financing, and continued improvement in operational metrics — like targeting an 83.8 percent seat occupancy rate and flying 5.2 billion passengers.

OPINION

By David Sempala

In the bustling terminals of Entebbe International Airport, frustration has become as common as departure announcements. Uganda Airlines, the nation's revived flag carrier, has been plagued by a series of setbacks that epitomise the broader struggles of African aviation. Just this month, passengers bound for Dubai and other destinations found themselves stranded for days due to technical faults, with planes grounded in Lagos and London. Reports of poor communication, lack of accommodations, and even police intervention in Dubai to secure meals for affected travellers have sparked public outrage.

The airline, already haemorrhaging losses, nearly 300 billion Ugandan shillings (about $80 million) in 2024 alone, faces accusations of mismanagement, including an unqualified CEO earning a salary ten times that of her counterpart at profitable Ethiopian Airlines. These incidents aren't isolated; they reflect a continent-wide crisis where national carriers buckle under operational constraints, rising costs, and fierce competition from well-capitalised global players.

Africa's aviation sector, despite leading global growth in passenger numbers post-pandemic, remains hamstrung by structural barriers. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects African airlines will eke out a meagre $0.2 billion in profits for 2025, translating to a slim 1.1% net margin, far below the global average. Challenges abound: fragmented markets and policies hinder seamless operations, while high fuel costs, excessive taxes, and blocked funds (where governments restrict repatriation of airline revenues) erode viability. Safety concerns persist, with Africa's accident rate at 1.1 per million flights in 2025, underscoring inadequate infrastructure and regulatory gaps.

Geopolitical tensions, from conflicts rerouting flights to security risks in volatile regions, compound these issues. Meanwhile, intra-African connectivity lags: only 20% of air travel on the continent stays within Africa, forcing passengers to endure costly detours via Europe or the Middle East.

Uganda Airlines' woes mirror those of peers like Kenya Airways, which has grappled with debt and required bailouts despite partnerships with KLM. As the attached post notes, these carriers face operational constraints, fleet underutilization, and the harsh realities of competing against entrenched regional giants. Yet, the post also highlights a path forward: strategic private partnerships and governance reforms. But why stop at national fixes? Africa's aviation needs a bolder vision, a joint Pan-African airline where countries hold shares, pooling resources for collective strength.

Imagine a carrier modelled on the African Union's aspirations, with equity distributed among member states based on population, GDP, or aviation needs. This ""Air Africa"" could leverage economies of scale to negotiate better fuel deals, aircraft leases, and maintenance contracts, slashing costs that currently cripple smaller operators. Shared fleets would optimise utilisation, addressing issues like Uganda's limited wide-body aircraft that led to recent disruptions. By focusing on unserved routes, it could boost intra-continental travel, plugging gaps in the network and fostering trade under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).

Tourism would flourish with affordable, direct flights between Lagos and Johannesburg, or Nairobi and Dakar, unlocking economic growth estimated at billions in added GDP. The benefits extend beyond economics. A Pan-African airline would embody unity, much like the defunct Air Afrique, which connected West African nations in the 1960s-2000s before succumbing to mismanagement.

Lessons from that era, ensuring transparent governance and avoiding political interference, could guide success. Shareholder countries would enforce accountability through a multinational board, blending public oversight with private expertise. Sustainability gains traction too: collective bargaining for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could overcome current barriers like high costs and regulatory voids, positioning Africa as a green aviation leader.

Critics might argue that fragmentation makes such a venture improbable, citing past alliances' failures. Yet, recent moves—like Kenya Airways' partnerships reshaping alliances—show momentum. With the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM) aiming for liberalisation, a joint airline could accelerate implementation, reducing protectionism that shields inefficient carriers.

National pride, as Uganda wants to be, can't sustain an airline alone. But smart, continent-wide partnerships can. By uniting as shareholders, African nations could transform aviation from a perennial loss-maker into an engine of integration and prosperity. For Uganda Airlines and its counterparts, this could be the lifeline: not revival in isolation, but rebirth through solidarity. The skies await Africa's collective ascent.

The order book of EnviTec Biogas AG shows three new contract signings with first-time customers in Germany. All newly secured projects involve gas upgrading plants that will be manufactured at EnviTec’s Saerbeck site over the coming months. With the project in Biburg, Lower Bavaria, EnviTec Biogas is establishing a presence in the Bavarian market for the first time, following the construction of 112 plants across Germany. “The customer already operates a gas upgrading plant using water scrubbing technology, which will be decommissioned once our EnviThan upgrading plant has been installed,” explains EnviTec Biogas Area Sales Manager DACH, Christian Eilert.

“Nearly two years passed between our first contact at the Biogas Convention & Trade Fair in Nuremberg in 2023 and the signing of the contract – two years marked by political uncertainties, constantly changing market conditions and lengthy permitting procedures,” reports customer Benedikt Bachmeier of Bioenergie Biburg. The initial grid feed-in date for the 1,000 Nm³/h biomethane plant has already been set: from July 2026, the plant is expected to begin injecting into the local network. “A key advantage of this project is that we are also supplying the booster compressor required to achieve the necessary grid pressure. This allowed us to significantly accelerate the overall grid injection process,” Eilert adds.

In addition to the time savings and low power consumption of the EnviThan plant, the customer was particularly impressed by EnviTec’s customised design approach. “Given the structural constraints of the existing biogas plant, space on site is limited. However, our flexible container-based construction enables us to accommodate the conditions effectively,” says Eilert. The EnviTec team is also responding flexibly to the site conditions of its second new customer, Hamme Energie GmbH & Co. KG, located in Osterholz-Scharmbeck near Bremen. “Here too, we are constructing a gas upgrading plant as an extension to the existing biogas plant,” Eilert continues.

The EnviThan system is already under construction in Saerbeck, with delivery scheduled for March 2026. The 137 Nm³/h EnviThan plant can be upgraded onsite to 232 Nm³/h of biomethane by simply adding membranes. The biomethane produced will be fed into the network of Osterholzer Stadtwerke. The plant is supplied with dairy cattle slurry, cattle manure and silage maize from the company’s own farming operations.

The third contract was signed in Reichardtswerben in Saxony-Anhalt. The plant, being built for a Dutch operator of a large dairy farming enterprise, can be expanded from 200 Nm³/h biomethane in its initial configuration to 400 Nm³/h. Once completed, it is intended to inject into the Ontras network to supply the fuel market. “For this project as well, we have already ordered all components and can begin production as soon as the container arrives,” says Eilert.

Furthermore, this event fits into a broader global trend of agricultural protectionism and the ""greening"" of farm policy.
Summary and Investor Takeaways The current state of U.S. agricultural policy is a study in the limitations of emergency intervention.
Equipment Rebound Timing: Monitor the September Farm Bill deadline; a long-term bill could be the ""buy"" signal for Deere and CNH Industrial.","As the 2026 calendar year begins, the United States agricultural sector finds itself at a critical policy crossroads. On one hand, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has just finalized the enrollment for its $12 billion Farmer Bridge Assistance (FBA) program, a massive infusion of ad-hoc cash designed to keep producers afloat through February 2026. On the other hand, a growing chorus of commodity leaders and farm advocacy groups is signaling that they have reached a breaking point with ""mailbox farming,"" demanding that Washington move away from emergency bailouts in favor of permanent, structural reforms to the nation’s agricultural safety net.

The immediate implications are stark: while the FBA payments will provide a necessary liquidity injection for corn, soybean, and cotton farmers facing compressed margins, the reliance on such measures underscores the failure of Congress to pass a comprehensive, five-year Farm Bill. With the 2018 Farm Bill now extended through September 2026 following a year of intense legislative gridlock, the agricultural industry is entering a high-stakes period where the very definition of federal support is being contested. Farmers are increasingly calling for higher reference prices and trade stability rather than the unpredictable, politically charged relief packages that have characterized the last several years.

The Push for Permanent Policy Over Temporary Relief

The current friction stems from the December 2025 announcement of the FBA program, which allocated $11 billion for row crops and $1 billion for specialty crops and sugar. The program was necessitated by a ""perfect storm"" of high input costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and trade disruptions that saw the farm income safety net fail to trigger adequately under existing 2018 rules. According to USDA data, the payment rates for the 2026 distribution are significant: rice producers are set to receive $132.89 per acre, while cotton and corn farmers will see $117.35 and $44.36 per acre, respectively. While these funds are a lifeline, commodity leaders argue they are a symptom of a broken system.

The timeline leading to this moment is defined by the expiration of the original Farm Bill in late 2024 and a subsequent series of short-term extensions. Throughout 2025, House Agriculture Chairman G.T. Thompson attempted to advance a ""Farm Bill 2.0,"" which sought to increase commodity reference prices by as much as 21% to account for inflation. However, these efforts were derailed by a significant government shutdown in late 2025 and a fractured political coalition between urban nutrition advocates and rural farm interests. The result was the current extension, which leaves farmers operating under outdated price floors while the USDA scrambles to fill the gap with ad-hoc programs like the FBA.

Key stakeholders, including the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) and the National Farmers Union (NFU), have shifted their rhetoric from gratitude to demand. AFBF President Zippy Duvall recently noted that while aid ""bridges the gap,"" the industry cannot thrive on a ""patchwork of emergency checks."" The NFU has gone further, launching a ""Fairness for Farmers"" campaign that targets the structural roots of the problem, including corporate consolidation in the seed and fertilizer sectors and the lack of mandatory country-of-origin labeling, which they argue suppresses the ""bottom line"" more than any subsidy can fix.

Corporate Impact: From Machinery Slumps to Seed Spin-offs

The policy vacuum and the shift toward ad-hoc aid have sent ripples through the public markets, particularly affecting companies tied to farmer capital expenditures. Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) has been a primary casualty of the uncertainty; the machinery giant reported a nearly 15% decline in large agricultural equipment sales in late 2025. With farmers hesitant to invest in new fleets without a long-term Farm Bill in place, Deere has guided for 2026 to be the ""bottom of the cycle,"" though a successful transition to structural support could trigger a massive replacement cycle in 2027. Similarly, CNH Industrial (NYSE: CNHI) has been forced to implement production cuts and manage bloated inventories as the ""wait-and-see"" approach among producers persists.

In the seeds and chemicals space, Corteva (NYSE: CTVA) is navigating a radical transformation in response to these market pressures. The company recently announced a massive corporate split to be completed by late 2026, dividing into a seed-focused entity (""SpinCo"") and a crop protection-focused ""New Corteva."" This move is seen by analysts as a defensive play against increased federal scrutiny of input pricing and a way to insulate its high-margin Pioneer seed brand from the volatility of the broader chemical market. Meanwhile, Bayer (OTC: BAYRY) continues to face pressure as the calls for structural reform often include heightened anti-trust oversight of the ""Big Three"" seed providers.

The processing and grain handling sector is also feeling the heat. Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE: ADM) and Bunge Global (NYSE: BG) have both seen earnings volatility as ""crush margins"" collapsed in late 2025. For ADM, the delay in clarifying biofuel tax credits—specifically the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit—has stalled investments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) infrastructure. If the 2026 policy shift includes the ""biofuel pivot"" that farm groups are lobbying for, ADM and Bunge could see a significant rebound in demand for corn and soybean oil, transforming their outlook from stagnant to high-growth.

Broader Significance and Historical Context

The current demand for structural reform is not just about money; it is a battle over the future of the American ""family farm"" model versus increasing industrialization. Historically, the U.S. has used ad-hoc aid during times of extreme crisis, such as the 1980s farm crisis or the trade wars of 2018-2019. However, the fact that these ""emergency"" payments have become a near-annual occurrence suggests that the 2018 Farm Bill's safety net—designed for a lower-inflation, more stable trade era—is fundamentally obsolete. This trend mirrors the ""permanent emergency"" state seen in other sectors, but in agriculture, it risks decoupling farm income from market signals entirely.

Furthermore, this event fits into a broader global trend of agricultural protectionism and the ""greening"" of farm policy. The push for structural changes in 2026 is heavily intertwined with the transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Farm groups are essentially asking for a trade: they will accept more stringent environmental standards if the government provides a permanent, predictable market for biofuels through tax credits and infrastructure support. This would represent a historic shift in U.S. policy, moving from a ""price support"" model to a ""demand creation"" model.

The regulatory implications are also profound. The National Farmers Union’s focus on consolidation suggests that the next Farm Bill may include ""Competition Titles"" for the first time in decades. This could lead to increased oversight by the Department of Justice and the USDA into the pricing power of companies like CF Industries (NYSE: CF) in the fertilizer market or Tyson Foods (NYSE: TSN) in meatpacking. If structural reform includes anti-trust measures, the valuation premiums currently enjoyed by dominant agricultural players could be at risk.

The 2026 Outlook: Strategic Pivots and Scenarios

Looking ahead to the remainder of 2026, the primary focus for the market will be the September 30 expiration of the current Farm Bill extension. In the short term, the distribution of the $12 billion FBA payments in February will likely provide a temporary boost to the share prices of agricultural retailers and equipment dealers as farmers use the cash to settle debts and make essential purchases. However, for a sustained market recovery, investors will need to see a ""Grand Bargain"" in Washington that reconciles the 21% reference price hike with the budget constraints of the 2025 reconciliation act.

A potential strategic pivot for the industry involves the ""45Z"" tax credit. If the administration provides a clear, long-term framework for carbon-intensity scoring by mid-2026, it could unlock billions in private investment. This would benefit companies like Darling Ingredients (NYSE: DAR), which is heavily invested in renewable diesel. Conversely, if the policy remains mired in ad-hoc cycles, we may see further consolidation as smaller family farms are forced to sell to larger corporate entities that have the balance sheets to weather the uncertainty.

The most likely scenario for the second half of 2026 is a ""Farm Bill 2.0"" that prioritizes crop insurance and biofuel demand over direct commodity payments. This would be a win for the insurance sector and biofuel processors but might leave traditional row-crop farmers in a tighter margin environment if trade relations with major importers like China do not improve.

Summary and Investor Takeaways

The current state of U.S. agricultural policy is a study in the limitations of emergency intervention. While the USDA's $12 billion FBA program provides a necessary buffer, the loud calls for structural reform from groups like the AFBF and NFU indicate that the industry is ready for a fundamental shift. The transition from ""mailbox farming"" to a market-driven, biofuel-integrated safety net is the primary objective for 2026.

For investors, the key takeaways are:

Watch the 45Z Credit: The clarification of biofuel tax credits will be a bigger catalyst for ADM and Bunge than any direct USDA payment.

Equipment Rebound Timing: Monitor the September Farm Bill deadline; a long-term bill could be the ""buy"" signal for Deere and CNH Industrial.

Input Scrutiny: Be cautious of companies with high market concentration in seeds and chemicals, as ""Fairness for Farmers"" initiatives may lead to regulatory headwinds.

As the February 28 payment deadline approaches, the market will be watching to see if this is the last of the ""great bailouts"" or if the U.S. is destined to remain in a cycle of ad-hoc agricultural management. The next nine months will decide whether the American farm economy enters a new era of structural stability or continues to lean on the crutch of emergency aid.

A surprising new development is taking place in the world of aviation fuel.

In this plant, used cooking oil will collected and co-processed in the full conversion hydrocracker unit of the existing refinery to create fuel for aircraft.

Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri announced that Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) has launched a demonstration plant at its Visakhapatnam Refinery. The plant will produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil (UCO) sourced from homes, hotels, and restaurants. This UCO will be co-processed in the existing refinery's full conversion hydrocracker unit to create fuel for aircraft.

The Indian government has described this initiative as essential for reducing carbon emissions from the aviation industry and advancing the concept of waste-to-wealth. Globally, there is a growing effort to make aviation turbine fuel (ATF) more environmentally friendly.

According to a report from Jagran.com, SAF has up to 80 percent lower carbon emissions than conventional jet fuel and can be used in current aircraft engines without modification. HPCL's roadmap indicates that, once international certification is received, the Visakhapatnam refinery will produce around 10,000 tonnes of SAF annually starting in January 2027. This production will play a significant role in helping India meet its SAF blending targets.

The Indian government has set an ambitious goal to blend five percent SAF into ATF by 2030. Puri remarked, ""Airplanes will fly using cooking oil used in frying pans. We are moving rapidly towards achieving the goal of using one percent SAF in the fuel of all international flights by 2027 and reducing carbon emissions from aviation fuel.""",https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2026/01/02/article/image/Cooking-oil-for-plane-1767364334787.webp,N,,2026-01-02 12:12:30.169844

¿Hasta dónde llegará el largo radio de pasillo único?","Aviación Digital, Sp.- Durante décadas, la aviación comercial asumió que el largo radio era territorio casi exclusivo de los aviones de fuselaje ancho, desde los pioneros Boeing 747 hasta los actuales A350 o 787. Hoy, la llegada del Airbus A321XLR a aerolíneas como Iberia plantea un cambio de paradigma: ¿hasta qué punto un avión de pasillo único puede capturar parte significativa del mercado transatlántico manteniendo estándares de confort, seguridad y sostenibilidad propios del segmento widebody?

La incorporación del séptimo A321XLR de Iberia, matrícula EC-ORE, a pocas horas de cerrar 2025, convierte a este modelo en un pilar estructural de la red de largo radio de la compañía con base en Madrid-Barajas, mientras la octava unidad ya figura en el plan de flota para 2026. Esta apuesta no solo es un movimiento de capacidad: implica decisiones estratégicas sobre diseño de red, cumplimiento regulatorio, gestión del riesgo y posicionamiento competitivo a medio plazo.grupo.

Plataforma A321XLR: capacidades técnicas y certificación

El Airbus A321XLR es la variante de mayor alcance de la familia A320neo, diseñada para vuelos de hasta unas 11 horas y un radio aproximado de 4.700 millas náuticas, lo que permite unir pares de ciudades como Madrid–Boston o Roma–Nueva York con un solo pasillo. La aeronave incorpora un Rear Centre Tank (RCT) integrado estructuralmente en el fuselaje, así como mejoras en peso máximo al despegue y sistemas que permiten operar con prestaciones comparables a algunos widebody en rutas “thin” de largo radio (Rutas de largo radio con baja demanda).

Desde el punto de vista regulatorio, el A321XLR ha superado un proceso de certificación especialmente exigente con EASA, centrado en la resistencia al fuego y la integridad estructural del RCT (el tanque central de combustible), así como en las prestaciones de evacuación en escenarios post-impacto.

Motores y eficiencia: palanca de sostenibilidad y costes

El A321XLR puede equiparse con motores Pratt & Whitney GTF o CFM LEAP-1A, ambos diseñados para lograr reducciones de consumo de combustible y emisiones de CO₂ en el entorno del 15–20% respecto a la generación anterior de narrowbodies. Estas mejoras se apoyan en tecnologías como el fan engranado en el caso del GTF, o el uso de materiales avanzados y combustión optimizada en el LEAP, con un impacto adicional en ruido exterior e interior, un factor clave en aeropuertos hub con restricciones operativas.

Para operadores como Iberia, la combinación de un fuselaje de pasillo único con motores de alta eficiencia permite abordar varias prioridades simultáneas: reducción de costes por asiento (un 30% por asiento frente a competidores de la generación anterior), cumplimiento de objetivos de sostenibilidad y compatibilidad con mezclas crecientes de Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) que la UE impulsará en el marco de iniciativas como ReFuelEU. En términos estratégicos, esta configuración encaja con el discurso corporativo de modernización de flota y alineamiento con los compromisos de descarbonización sectorial a 2030 y 2050.

La apuesta de Iberia: siete A321XLR hoy, ocho en 2026

Iberia fue en noviembre de 2024 la primera aerolínea del mundo en operar el Airbus A321XLR, adelantándose a competidores europeos y americanos en la explotación comercial de este tipo de aeronave en rutas de largo radio. A cierre de 2025, la compañía suma ya siete unidades en servicio, con la octava prevista para 2026, cumpliendo el pedido inicial de ocho aviones destinado a reforzar su red intercontinental desde Madrid.

Esta flota A321XLR se integra en un mix que incluye A350 y A330, permitiendo a la aerolínea ajustar la capacidad al comportamiento real de cada mercado: el narrowbody se asigna a rutas “thin” o emergentes, así como a incrementos de frecuencia, mientras que los widebody se reservan para destinos de mayor densidad o para vuelos con fuerte componente de carga. La declaración de la propia Iberia sobre que el A321XLR “ha transformado su estrategia de largo radio” subraya que ya no se trata de un experimento marginal, sino de una pieza central en la arquitectura de red y de ingresos.

Cabina, experiencia de pasajero y percepción del “single aisle” en largo radio

La flota A321XLR de Iberia incorpora la cabina Airspace, con compartimentos superiores de mayor capacidad, iluminación LED configurable y mejoras en la sensación espacial, criterios esenciales para mitigar la percepción de confinamiento en vuelos de 7–9 horas con un solo pasillo. La aerolínea destaca que el estándar de producto —business con asientos cama, IFE de última generación y conectividad— se alinea con el nivel de sus A330 y A350, buscando neutralizar la posible reticencia del segmento corporativo a volar largo radio en narrowbody.

Para el pasajero profesional, el debate no es solo de comodidad, sino también de robustez operativa: un avión más pequeño puede ofrecer más opciones de horario y una menor probabilidad de cancelación por baja ocupación, aunque la capacidad de “reacomodo” en caso de incidencias sea menor que con un widebody. El reto para Iberia y el resto de operadores que adopten este modelo será gestionar la percepción de seguridad, confort y fiabilidad, explicando con transparencia las ventajas técnicas y operativas del A321XLR frente a los esquemas tradicionales de flota.

Cabe mencionar que, en otros tiempos, las aerolíneas invitaban a medios especializados a experimentar estos vuelos inaugurales de primera mano, permitiendo a periodistas y expertos del sector evaluar directamente la cabina, el producto y la operativa real para transmitir una valoración objetiva a sus lectores. Esa práctica, aparentemente en desuso, habría permitido contrastar sobre el terreno las promesas comerciales con la experiencia tangible del pasajero en un A321XLR operando a máximo radio. Quizás, en la era de los comunicados de prensa y las especificaciones técnicas, se considere que la experiencia directa del periodismo especializado ya no aporta valor al debate público sobre la evolución de la aviación comercial…que equivocación.

Regulación, ETOPS y gestión del riesgo en monocobertura oceánica

La operación de un A321XLR en rutas transoceánicas exige capacidades ETOPS/EDTO avanzadas y una coordinación estrecha con autoridades como EASA y AESA en materia de certificación, mantenimiento, formación de tripulaciones y planes de contingencia. La presencia del RCT y la mayor dependencia de la integridad de un fuselaje single aisle en escenarios de despresurización, fuego o amerizaje plantean requisitos específicos en cuanto a diseño, pruebas de resistencia al fuego y protocolos de evacuación.

Además, el entorno regulatorio europeo avanza hacia una supervisión más granular del rendimiento en seguridad, con énfasis en indicadores de confiabilidad de motores, sistemas de combustible y datos de vuelo, en línea con los principios de los Safety Management Systems (SMS) y la monitorización de riesgos emergentes en aeronaves de nueva generación. Para Iberia, esto implica integrar en su sistema de gestión de seguridad la experiencia operativa acumulada con los primeros A321XLR, alimentando bucles de mejora continua que den confianza tanto a reguladores como a la comunidad profesional.

Implicaciones económicas: coste por asiento, yields y estrategia de flota

Desde un punto de vista económico, el principal atractivo del A321XLR reside en un coste por asiento sensiblemente inferior al de muchos widebody modernos, combinado con un coste por vuelo cercano a la mitad en determinadas configuraciones, según datos de Airbus. Esta combinación permite operar rutas de baja o media densidad que serían marginales o directamente deficitarias con aviones de fuselaje ancho, así como probar nuevos mercados con un riesgo financiero mucho menor.

La apuesta de Iberia se inserta en un plan de inversión a 2030 que contempla incrementar su flota de largo radio de 45 a aproximadamente 70 aeronaves, con una mezcla más balanceada entre A350, A330 y A321XLR. En términos de ingresos, la estrategia apunta a reforzar el hub de Madrid como plataforma de conexión Europa–América con mayor granularidad de destinos y horarios, lo que puede elevar los yields mediante oferta de productos de alto valor (business/ premium economy) sin asumir el riesgo estructural de un exceso de plazas en rutas volátiles.

Contexto competitivo: ¿redefinición del papel del widebody?

La consolidación del A321XLR en Iberia y otras aerolíneas plantea un cambio en el reparto de roles entre narrowbody y widebody a escala global. Los aviones de pasillo ancho seguirán siendo indispensables en rutas de altísima densidad, vuelos con fuerte componente de carga y operaciones ultra-long-range, pero el espacio de mercado “intermedio” se estrecha conforme los narrowbodies ganan alcance y prestaciones.

Para fabricantes, reguladores y operadores, este desplazamiento de la frontera tecnológica obliga a revisar hipótesis sobre amortización de flota, inversión en infraestructura aeroportuaria y diseño de programas de fidelización centrados en la experiencia de cabina más que en la “escala” del avión.

La experiencia de Iberia como primer operador global del A321XLR ofrece un laboratorio a cielo abierto para evaluar cómo evolucionan factores como satisfacción del pasajero, fiabilidad técnica, costes de mantenimiento y resiliencia ante disrupciones en una flota de largo radio crecientemente híbrida.

¿Hasta dónde llegará el largo radio de pasillo único?

La incorporación del séptimo Airbus A321XLR a la flota de Iberia no es un simple hito numérico, sino la consolidación de un modelo operativo que combina eficiencia, flexibilidad y ambición de red en un momento de fuerte presión regulatoria y climática sobre la aviación. Para la comunidad aeronáutica, el caso Iberia obliga a repensar la separación clásica entre narrowbody y widebody, y a revisar los criterios con los que se evalúan inversiones en flota, diseño de rutas, políticas de sostenibilidad y marcos regulatorios asociados al largo radio.

La cuestión que queda abierta para aerolíneas, fabricantes, reguladores y proveedores de servicios es nítida: si el A321XLR se puede consolidar como estándar para rutas transatlánticas de densidad media, ¿qué papel deberán jugar los widebody en la próxima década, y cómo deberán adaptarse los modelos de negocio —especialmente en hubs como Madrid— para capturar el valor de este cambio sin comprometer seguridad, resiliencia y competitividad en un entorno cada vez más exigente ?",https://aviaciondigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/A321XLR-Iberia.webp,N,,2026-01-02 02:56:36.890887

China Aircraft Leasing Group Holdings Limited (CALC) has finalized a firm order for 30 additional Airbus A320neo Family aircraft, underscoring its confidence in the ongoing recovery of the global aviation sector. The agreement, concluded on December 30, 2025, is valued in the billions and reinforces CALC’s position as a leading global aircraft lessor. This move also highlights the increasing demand within the industry for fuel-efficient, narrow-body jets that meet evolving operational and environmental requirements.

This latest acquisition represents CALC’s fifth direct purchase from Airbus since their partnership began in 2012. With these new aircraft, CALC’s total Airbus order book rises to 282, including 203 from the A320neo Family. The decision aligns with airlines’ growing preference for modern, eco-conscious fleets designed to comply with tightening environmental regulations worldwide.

Strategic Considerations and Market Context

Mike Poon, Executive Director and CEO of CALC, emphasized the strategic importance of the order, stating, “Our enduring partnership with Airbus has been central to CALC’s growth. This order reflects our commitment to providing airline customers with high-value, modern aircraft solutions that align with a sustainable aviation ecosystem.”

The Airbus A320neo is widely regarded as the benchmark for narrow-body jets due to its superior fuel efficiency, passenger comfort, and operational versatility. The aircraft delivers at least 20% fuel savings and significant reductions in CO2 emissions compared to previous generations. Its cabin, the widest among single-aisle aircraft, offers enhanced comfort for short- and medium-haul travelers. Furthermore, CALC’s agreement includes conversion rights, allowing flexibility to switch between the standard A320neo and the larger, longer-range A321neo to meet diverse client requirements.

A notable feature of the A320neo is its compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Currently capable of operating with a 50% SAF blend, Airbus aims to achieve 100% SAF capability by 2030. As environmental regulations become more stringent across Europe and Asia, CALC’s investment in the A320neo family represents a proactive effort to future-proof its portfolio against carbon taxes and rising passenger expectations for greener travel.

Challenges and Competitive Environment

Despite the positive outlook, CALC’s expansion faces potential challenges. Global supply chain disruptions and manufacturing constraints could delay aircraft deliveries. Additionally, competition remains intense, particularly from Boeing. While Boeing’s 737 MAX continues to encounter regulatory scrutiny, giving Airbus a competitive advantage in the Chinese market, the broader competitive landscape remains dynamic and uncertain.

This order coincides with similar fleet expansion initiatives by CALC’s rivals. Chinese carriers such as Spring Airlines and Juneyao Air have recently placed their own orders for A320neo aircraft, potentially accelerating their growth plans. This intensifying competition may influence market dynamics and prompt further strategic responses across the sector.

Implications for the Market

CALC’s latest order is expected to bolster investor confidence in its growth strategy and strengthen Airbus’s foothold in China, especially as Boeing seeks to regain market share. As the aviation industry moves into 2026, CALC’s commitment to sustainable and efficient aircraft underscores a broader industry shift toward eco-conscious, future-ready fleets, setting a precedent for the next phase of global aviation.",https://pub-a51e4d676a044eb380faeff15def343e.r2.dev/a6d0501dc5a8454c9cd655dc6d9ee613.avif,N,,2026-01-02 00:56:51.401067

These environmental tax policies are designed to tackle the region’s carbon footprint while encouraging greener business practices, transportation, and energy production. The most prominent changes will occur in Singapore and Malaysia, with other Southeast Asian countries actively working on similar initiatives. Here’s a detailed look at the green taxes being introduced in Southeast Asia from 2026 onwards.

1) Singapore — Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy

In a groundbreaking move, Singapore will become the first country to implement a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy, also known as the green flight tax, aimed at promoting sustainable aviation. Starting April 2026, airlines departing from Singapore will be required to pay a levy that supports the use of sustainable aviation fuel, a key component in reducing carbon emissions from air travel.

Who pays: All passengers flying from Singapore will contribute to this levy, which will be added to the cost of their tickets.

Rates: The SAF Levy will vary depending on the flight’s destination and cabin class. For short-haul flights within Southeast Asia, the levy will be approximately S$1 for economy class passengers and S$4 for premium class. For long-haul flights, the levy can rise up to S$41.60. This charge is expected to grow over time as more sustainable fuel is blended into the aviation industry.

Key point: This green flight tax is a significant step in Singapore’s effort to reduce the environmental impact of air travel. It aligns with the country’s broader climate goals to decarbonize industries and foster sustainability in aviation.

2) Singapore — Increased Carbon Tax

Alongside the SAF Levy, Singapore is also raising its carbon tax to further incentivize emissions reductions in the industrial sector. Currently, Singapore applies a carbon tax of S$25 per tonne of CO₂ equivalent (tCO₂e), but this will increase to S$45 per tonne starting in 2026. This adjustment is part of the country’s phased approach to ensure it meets its climate action targets and contributes to global efforts to mitigate climate change.

Who pays: This tax primarily affects industrial facilities and businesses that emit more than a specified threshold of greenhouse gases, including energy producers and manufacturing companies.

Purpose: The goal is to reduce industrial carbon emissions and encourage companies to adopt cleaner technologies and renewable energy sources.

Key point: The carbon tax increase is one of Singapore’s most direct methods of combating climate change and making carbon-intensive industries more sustainable in the long run. It is expected to boost innovation in the green energy sector and force businesses to consider greener alternatives.

3) Malaysia — National Carbon Tax

Malaysia has announced its own carbon pricing system, which is set to be introduced in 2026. As part of its 2026 Budget, the Malaysian government plans to implement a national carbon tax, targeting high-emission sectors such as energy, cement production, and steel manufacturing. This tax is designed to help Malaysia transition towards a low-carbon economy and support the country’s climate commitments under the Paris Agreement.

Who pays: The tax will apply to high-emitting industries that exceed a set carbon threshold. These include energy producers, manufacturers, and other large-scale industrial operations.

Purpose: The carbon tax will help price carbon emissions and encourage businesses to adopt cleaner, more energy-efficient technologies, supporting Malaysia’s goal to reduce its overall carbon footprint.

Key point: This move marks Malaysia’s first major carbon pricing initiative, reflecting a regional shift towards sustainable practices and the recognition of carbon pricing as a tool for climate change mitigation. It will gradually push industries toward embracing renewable energy and low-carbon technologies.

Other Southeast Asian Countries’ Green Tax Initiatives

While Singapore and Malaysia are leading the charge, other Southeast Asian countries are in the process of exploring or implementing similar green tax policies. For example:

Thailand has a Climate Change Bill that includes provisions for carbon pricing, though the tax rates and implementation timeline remain unclear as of 2026.

Vietnam is updating its Special Consumption Tax Law, which indirectly includes environmental objectives, though a dedicated carbon tax has not been formally set yet.

Indonesia and other nations in the region are still developing frameworks for carbon pricing and green taxes, with many initiatives expected to roll out in the coming years.

Conclusion: Southeast Asia’s Push for Sustainability

Starting in 2026, Southeast Asia will see a surge in green taxes and carbon pricing mechanisms as part of a larger push toward sustainability. These environmental taxes, which include the SAF Levy in Singapore, carbon tax increases in both Singapore and Malaysia, and other similar initiatives, aim to reduce carbon emissions, promote cleaner industries, and make the region more resilient to climate change.

For travelers, businesses, and industries, these green taxes will lead to increased costs but also offer opportunities for innovation and greener practices. With Singapore and Malaysia taking the lead, Southeast Asia is poised to become a key player in the global green economy, providing a model for other countries in the region to follow.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Untitled-design-800x600-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 00:56:58.975157

As the aviation industry enters 2026, this multi-billion dollar commitment reinforces CALC’s position as a premier global lessor and underscores the relentless demand for fuel-efficient, narrow-body jets.

The start of 2026 has brought a clear message from the world of aircraft leasing: the future is narrow-body and eco-conscious. The recent deal between Hong Kong-listed CALC and Airbus is more than just a purchase; it is a strategic maneuver to satisfy an “insatiable” demand from airlines worldwide for the A320neo—the “workhorse” of modern skies.

This latest agreement marks CALC’s fifth direct order with Airbus since their partnership took flight in 2012. With these 30 new units, CALC’s total order book with the European planemaker rises to 282 aircraft, of which an impressive 203 belong to the A320neo Family.

The “Why” Behind the Buy

According to Mike Poon, Executive Director and CEO of CALC, the decision was driven by a shared vision for innovation. “Our enduring partnership with Airbus has been central to CALC’s growth,” Poon noted. “This order reflects our commitment to providing our airline customers with high-value, modern aircraft solutions that align with a sustainable aviation ecosystem.”

For lessors like CALC, the A320neo is the “gold standard” for several human and economic reasons:

Efficiency for Airlines: The A320neo (New Engine Option) delivers at least 20% fuel savings and CO2 reduction compared to previous generations.

Comfort for Passengers: Featuring the widest single-aisle cabin in the sky, these jets provide a sense of space that is often lacking in short-to-medium haul travel.

Versatility: The order includes conversion rights, allowing CALC to switch between the standard A320neo and the larger, longer-range A321neo depending on what their airline clients—ranging from Air China to Uzbekistan Airways—need most.

Sustainability: The 2026 Flight Path

A key highlight of the announcement is the aircraft’s compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Currently, the A320neo can operate with a 50% SAF blend, and Airbus is aggressively targeting 100% SAF capability by 2030.

As environmental regulations tighten across Europe and Asia in 2026, having a “future-ready” fleet is no longer a luxury for leasing companies—it is a survival requirement. By investing in the “neo” family, CALC is essentially future-proofing its portfolio against carbon taxes and changing passenger expectations regarding “green” travel.

Market Impact: A Boost for Airbus in China

This deal is part of a larger trend of Airbus dominating the Chinese market as we move into 2026. While competitor Boeing continues to navigate its own recovery path, Airbus has secured several major year-end deals, including disclosed plans from Spring Airlines and Juneyao Airlines to acquire a combined 55 aircraft.

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus EVP Sales, emphasized that CALC’s “deep understanding of the market” serves as a solid endorsement of the A320neo’s reliability. For travelers, this means that in the coming decade, you are increasingly likely to find yourself on a modern, quieter, and more efficient Airbus jet regardless of which airline you book.

This combination of factors makes 2026 poised to be a banner year for global tourism, creating more opportunities for travelers and businesses alike.","As 2026 approaches, the global tourism industry is set to thrive, with air travel playing a critical role in this upward trajectory. Airlines, under the latest forecasts by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), are expecting to carry a record 5.2 billion passengers, underscoring a remarkable demand for international and domestic travel. This surge in air traffic is seen as a key driver for global tourism, enhancing connectivity, creating new economic opportunities, and facilitating a positive impact on tourism revenues worldwide.

Governments and tourism authorities are already capitalizing on these optimistic projections. Officials from tourism boards across the world recognize the close relationship between air travel demand and tourism growth, noting that the increase in flights opens doors for greater access to attractions, cultural experiences, and regional economic growth. Whether it’s the bustling cities of Europe, the beaches of Southeast Asia, or the wilderness of Africa, this projected rise in air travel will be the backbone for expanding tourism flows in key regions.

Airline Profits and Tourism Infrastructure

Airlines are also expected to report strong financial performances, with IATA projecting a global airline profit of $41 billion in 2026. This steady profitability is expected to be felt in the tourism sector, with airlines able to reinvest in expanding their networks, enhancing customer service, and improving overall travel experiences. From new routes to more frequent flights, these investments support the growth of tourism hubs, providing easier access to popular destinations as well as previously less-explored locales.

In many countries, this stability in the aviation sector is seen as a positive catalyst for job creation, infrastructure development, and community growth. Airports and local tourism boards have already begun working on expanding their facilities and services to accommodate the increasing number of passengers. This includes upgrades to airports, improved ground transportation networks, and more efficient visa processing systems—efforts that make travel smoother and more enjoyable for both tourists and residents.

Expanding Global Connectivity and Regional Tourism Growth

The forecasted 5.2 billion passengers in 2026 not only signals growth for major tourist destinations but also points to an opportunity for emerging regions to boost their share of global tourism. Asia, Africa, and parts of Latin America are projected to see substantial increases in air traffic. Countries in these regions are tapping into this surge by improving their tourism offerings, with government initiatives to promote cultural exchange, sustainable tourism, and eco-friendly travel options.

For example, Southeast Asia’s rise as a leading global tourist destination is being supported by an expanding airline network that offers more direct flights between major global cities and Southeast Asian hubs. This increased connectivity is expected to drive tourism to countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, which are already seeing a steady influx of international visitors.

Sustainability and Future Tourism Development

As airlines increase their operations, the issue of sustainability continues to be a significant consideration. Many governments and tourism bodies have incorporated green tourism practices into their strategies, aligning air travel growth with efforts to reduce carbon emissions. With the rise of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green airport initiatives, tourism can continue to flourish without compromising environmental goals.

Tourism boards are also actively marketing destinations that emphasize environmental conservation, such as national parks and nature reserves, providing travellers with sustainable options. This growing trend among travellers to choose eco-friendly destinations further supports the shift toward green tourism, helping to balance the economic benefits of air travel with the need to protect natural resources.

Regional Prosperity and Job Creation

Tourism, fueled by increased air travel, is also a vital engine for job creation. The IATA’s forecast suggests that airlines’ growth will directly impact jobs within the tourism sector, from hotel employees and tour guides to local artisans and hospitality staff. This is especially true for developing countries, where tourism serves as a key driver of local economies. As more tourists arrive, more job opportunities open up, contributing to the broader economic development of these regions.

Increased air traffic benefits not only tourism-heavy destinations but also smaller towns and rural areas looking to attract visitors. By enhancing regional connectivity, airlines are opening up new possibilities for tourism-focused businesses outside traditional tourist hotspots, enabling lesser-known areas to tap into the benefits of the global travel boom.

A Bright Future for Travel and Tourism in 2026

As 2026 approaches, the global tourism industry stands on the cusp of a prosperous year. With airlines forecasting record passenger numbers and stable profitability, destinations around the world are set to benefit from this surge in travel. Governments, tourism bodies, and the private sector are ready to capitalize on the increased air travel, making strategic investments in tourism infrastructure, sustainability initiatives, and marketing efforts.

North Dakota has long been a top honey producer, churning out 40 million pounds every year and bringing in close to US$67 million.
“What I fear is that we are not going to attach the environmental ethics to sustainable aviation fuel,” Klett said.
For environmentalists, just the threat of SAF-directed agriculture in places such as North Dakota is a sobering thought, especially given what’s happened elsewhere.
“Folks are concerned about how sustainable aviation fuel production could change the landscape,” she said, “unless we get the rules right”.","[PORTLAND] The Millers are a family of beekeepers in Gackle, North Dakota, a tiny farming town about 113 kilometres (70 miles) east of Bismarck. It was five decades ago when they began their labours here amid the endless swaths of sweet clover, alfalfa and the variety of other plant life that bees thrive on.

North Dakota has long been a top honey producer, churning out 40 million pounds every year and bringing in close to US$67 million. All of it courtesy of these undulating fields of wild grasses, and the buzzing insects who return to them each year.

“It was bee paradise,” said Jason Miller.

But not anymore. That paradise is slowly being transformed into a heaving ocean of corn and soybeans. Corn production in North Dakota alone has quadrupled to 16.5 million acres since the turn of the century, crowding out the diverse vegetation bees depend on.

Part of the reason has been the growing use of corn and soybean ethanol in biofuel, which mixes agricultural and waste feedstocks with fossil fuels for use in combustion engines. But more recently, it’s the promise of a newer biofuel that agricultural lobbyists and some environmentalists hope may someday supplant an intractable source of greenhouse gas emissions: jet fuel.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 created a US renewable fuel standard in part to decrease dependence on foreign oil. In 2021, president Joe Biden’s “Sustainable Airline Fuel Grand Challenge” turbocharged interest in jet biofuel, offering tax breaks to encourage production of three billion gallons of it by decade’s end. The aim was to help shrink the carbon footprint of air travel while locking in demand for US corn and soybeans, especially as the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) shrinks traditional ethanol use in cars.

Biofuels also can be made from animal fats, algae, waste cooking oils or agricultural waste such as wood chips and straw. While the US Environmental Protection Agency is to evaluate all of the pathways for corn or soybeans to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the agricultural industry and its lobbyists continue to prepare for what they hope is a fait accompli.

In the last year, US production capacity of SAF jumped from 5,000 to 30,000 barrels per day, according to government estimates, with much of the increase tied to new facilities coming online. And despite conflicting signals from the White House, the Trump administration just unfroze a US$1.67 billion Biden-era loan for biofuel processing plants.

The downside of making jet biofuel from corn or soybean production is that it will likely fuel significant land transformation, according to several expert analyses, including one by Braden Limb, a research scientist at Colorado State University. According to his study, about 50 per cent more cropland is needed for corn and soybeans to meet the 2050 SAF production goals.

“The maximum amount of land that we have converted to cropland in a single year (roughly 1.8 million acres), would have to be quadrupled every year for the next 30 years,” said Limb. And while collateral damage from efforts to slow global warming is not a new phenomenon, the expanded use of undeveloped land for biofuel-friendly monocultures and its destructive effect on bee populations could be especially significant for food production, the broader environment-and people such as Jason Miller.

“We used to make 140 pounds of honey per beehive,” he said. But these days, Miller’s bee colonies appear to be weakening. This year, he averaged only 33 pounds.

The bees that once thrived in North Dakota and places like it are the backbone of a US$400 million paid US pollination industry. Miller’s bees follow a pollination circuit in the spring, from almonds to apple and stone fruit orchards throughout the West. By late summer, they return to North Dakota to produce honey.

Honeybees populations already face a number of stressors-disease, pesticides and poor nutrition. Stressed bees are vulnerable to colony collapses: only a year ago US beekeepers lost more than half of their hives, according to an industry study. Katrina Klett, a doctoral student at the University of Minnesota who studies land use change and honeybee health, has seen up close the negative effects of grasslands giving way to to corn.

“What I fear is that we are not going to attach the environmental ethics to sustainable aviation fuel,” Klett said. “If we properly attach environmental metrics and outcomes to tax credit payments, we could move the needle to support farmers to adopt practices that increase diversity on the landscape.”

But as demand for air travel soars, so does aviation’s climate impact. According to the International Air Travel Association, air traffic rose more than 10 per cent between 2023 and 2024, making it one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Aviation contributes roughly 2.5 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions but is responsible for at least 3.5 per cent of human-caused climate change.

Airlines have been exploring the few options available to lower emissions, including SAF. The industry has committed to biofuel use and the International Civil Aviation Organization adopted an ambitious target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which would require significant biofuel inputs. Researchers such as Limb point to crops other than corn or soybeans, like sorghum and miscanthus, that can be used for biofuel but aren’t as damaging to ecosystems.

“All of our optimisation work,” Limb said, “says corn and soybeans are not the answer.”

There are forces at work that may yet forestall the mass repurposing of grasslands for biofuel. In 2022, the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, created by Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, crafted more incentives for domestic production and sale of low-carbon transportation fuels. But the Republican tax and spending bill passed this summer, while extending the credit, decreased the US$1.75 per gallon credit for SAF to US$1. Without that added subsidy, it may be difficult for SAF to be cost-competitive with regular jet fuel. (The bill did, however, change how biofuel sustainability is calculated in a way that makes it easier for producers to qualify while still clear-cutting forests or eliminating grasslands).

“Existing policy incentives make renewable diesel more profitable for most biofuel producers.”

There are other reasons SAF may still be too expensive to justify the investment. Jet fuel purity standards require complex processing and specialised equipment, and current feedstocks for SAF-including virgin vegetable oils-are typically more expensive than other biofuels. “Existing policy incentives make renewable diesel more profitable for most biofuel producers,” said Andrew Swanson, an agricultural economist at Montana State University.

Still, agricultural lobbies continue to express eagerness when it comes to jet biofuel given the effect EV use is having on corn and soybean ethanol markets. While pushing for a higher percentage of ethanol in petrol blends used in land transportation, organisations such as the National Corn Growers Association and state-based trade groups are seeking more government incentives to use corn and soybeans for SAF.

Another driver of aviation biofuel is the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia), an initiative that aims to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions from international flights. Corsia is a three-phase international agreement-the first two phases were voluntary, but beginning in 2027, Corsia becomes mandatory for most of international aviation, with some exceptions. Under the agreement, airlines must measure, report, verify and offset emissions that exceed the 2019 baseline.

For environmentalists, just the threat of SAF-directed agriculture in places such as North Dakota is a sobering thought, especially given what’s happened elsewhere. A new study by researchers at the University of California, Davis, found biofuel demand drove the conversion of 1.7 million hectares of forest to oil palm production in Indonesia and Malaysia between 2002 and 2018.

Turning wild grasslands into homogenous fields of corn and soybeans remains a “very real problem for biofuels”, said Jeremy Martin, director of fuels policy at the non-profit Union of Concerned Scientists, in a Nov 5 blog post. But there are other troubling consequences of the US biofuels push. Proposals for its production far exceed current domestic availability, meaning current mandates can only be met with imports and diverting vegetable oil from food to fuel, which will raise the cost of both while accelerating deforestation.

Swanson said the wild card in the SAF debate is trade, noting that the US exported almost two billion gallons of corn ethanol last year. “If US exports decline,” he said, “then we will need to find ways to increase domestic consumption-increasing land use change pressure”.

SAF advocates such as Veronica Bradley, director of environmental science for the industry lobby Clean Fuels Alliance America, counter that existing biofuel sources-used vegetable oil, beef tallow and forestry wastes-could satisfy near-term demand, as could shifting uses for corn ethanol amid the EV boom. For now, it appears the uncertainty over regulatory policies and incentives has put both the threat and promise of SAF, and in some respects the expanded use of biofuels in general, on hold.

“There is no real indication that we will move towards a clear, widely applicable standard for assessing land-use change and biodiversity impacts,” said Swanson. “This puts the SAF industry in a difficult position. Contradictory policy standards will mean that by catering to one market, you are cutting off the opportunity to produce for a different market.”

Back in North Dakota, Klett said beekeeping families such as hers and the Millers remain worried about what comes after that uncertainty lifts. “Folks are concerned about how sustainable aviation fuel production could change the landscape,” she said, “unless we get the rules right”.

SWISS is the first airline to sign a binding five-year SAF offtake agreement with Synhelion. This marks a pioneering step toward defossilizing aviation. From 2027, Synhelion will produce renewable synthetic crude oil, known as “syncrude”, at its first commercial plant. The syncrude will be processed in an existing refinery together with fossil crude oil and refined into certified Jet-A-1 fuel. Thus, Synhelion directly replaces fossil crude oil with sustainable syncrude, without the need for any adjustments to the existing infrastructure. The fuel will be delivered to the airport via the regular logistics chain and fed into the fuel supply system. Synhelion’s synthetic jet fuel is based on renewable energy and sustainable feedstocks.",,N,,2026-01-01 20:57:34.141792

With billions of dollars in new processing infrastructure already in place, industry leaders say the future of domestic energy may be growing in America’s fields.

The shift is being driven by a massive increase in production capacity, Paul Winters, Director of Public Affairs for Clean Fuels Alliance America, tells Mid-West Farm Report. While renewable diesel sat at just half a billion gallons in 2020, that capacity has surged to 6 billion gallons today.

“This year, sustainable aviation fuel technology came to fruition,” Winters notes. “There are a couple of plants in the United States that have ramped up significantly from essentially zero up to a few hundred million gallons.”

Despite the technological success, the industry remains in a holding pattern regarding federal regulation. While the inclusion of SAF in the 45Z clean tax credit was a major legislative victory, producers are still waiting for the U.S. Treasury and EPA to finalize the rules. Winters views this “policy stability” as the final bridge to making SAF economically competitive with traditional petroleum.

Beyond the environmental benefits, the growth of SAF represents a vital stabilizing force for farmers facing international market volatility. By keeping more soybeans at home for processing, the industry adds value to every bushel harvested.

“Biodiesel and renewable diesel represent 10 percent of the value of every single bushel of soybeans grown in the United States,” Winters says. “There’s room for growth there.”

Fuel costs are expected to decline slightly to $252 billion in 2026 (-0.3% from $253 billion in 2025).","The IATA released its latest financial outlook for the global airline industry showing a stabilization of profitability even as supply chain issues persist.

Highlights include:

Airlines are expected to achieve a combined total net profit of $41 billion in 2026 (up from $39.5 billion in 2025). While this would set a new record, the net profit margin is expected to be unchanged from 2025 at 3.9%. Net profit per passenger transported is expected to be $7.90 (below the 2023 high of $8.50, and unchanged from 2025).

Operating profit in 2026 is expected to be $72.8 billion (up from $67.0 billion in 2025) for a net operating margin of 6.9% (improved on the 6.6% expected for 2025).

Return on invested capital (ROIC) is expected to be 6.8% (unchanged from 2025). Despite deleveraging and improved operating profitability, ROIC is expected to remain below the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) estimated to be 8.2% in 2026.

Total industry revenues are expected to reach $1.053 trillion in 2026 (up 4.5% on the $1.008 trillion expected revenues in 2025).

Load factors are forecast to continue to set record highs with airlines expected to fill 83.8% of all seats over the year 2026.

Passenger numbers are expected to reach 5.2 billion in 2026 (up 4.4% on 2025).

Cargo volumes are expected to reach 71.6 million tonnes in 2026 (up 2.4% on 2025).

“Airlines are expected to generate a 3.9% net margin and a $41 billion profit in 2026. That’s extremely welcome news considering the headwinds that the industry faces—rising costs from bottlenecks in the aerospace supply chain, geopolitical conflict, sluggish global trade, and growing regulatory burdens among them. Airlines have successfully built shock-absorbing resilience into their businesses that is delivering stable profitability,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

While strong performance of airlines in the face of a changing and challenging operating environment is impressive, the fact that the airline industry collectively does not generate earnings that cover its cost of capital remains an issue to be resolved.

“Industry-level margins are still a pittance considering the value that airlines create by connecting people and economies. They stand at the core of a value chain that underpins nearly 4% of the global economy and supports 87 million jobs. Yet Apple will earn more selling an iPhone cover than the $7.90 airlines will make transporting the average passenger. And even within the air transport value chain, airline margins are totally out of balance, particularly when compared to margins of engine and avionics manufacturers and many of our service suppliers. Imagine the additional power that airlines could bring to economies if we could re-balance value chain profitability, reduce regulatory and tax burdens, and alleviate infrastructure inefficiencies,” said Walsh.

Air cargo’s performance is of particular interest as it has defied many predictions of gloom to hold its own amid rapidly changing trading conditions. “The resilience in air cargo has been particularly impressive. As trade flows adapt to a protectionist US tariff regime, air cargo has been the hero of global trade buoyed in part by robust e-commerce and semiconductor shipments to support the boom in AI investments. Notably, air cargo enabled front-loading to deliver products ahead of tariff deadlines, and it flexibly accommodated demand surges as tariffed goods normally destined for the US found new markets. The critical role of air cargo is front and center as the global economy adjusts to new realities,” said Walsh.

Outlook Drivers

Overall revenues are expected to grow by 4.5% to $1.053 trillion. This is expected to outpace operating expense growth of 4.2% to $981 billion, leading to a $1.5 billion improvement in industry-wide net profitability in 2026.

Macro-economic factors impacting airlines are mixed for 2026. On the positive side, GDP growth is expected to be largely stable at 3.1% and inflation is expected to ease slightly to 3.7%. World trade growth is, however, expected to be anemic at 0.5%.

Revenue

Passenger ticket revenues are expected to reach $751 billion in 2026 (+4.8% on $716 billion in 2025). This growth will be primarily driven by a 4.9% expansion of industry-wide revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) expected in 2026. Yields are expected to remain relatively flat while the passenger load factor is expected to set a new record at 83.8% as new aircraft remain in short supply.

Ancillary and other revenues are projected to rise by 5.5%, reaching $145 billion. Ancillary services now account for nearly 14% of total revenue, up from 12-13% pre-pandemic.

Cargo revenue is forecast to reach $158 billion in 2026 (+2.1% on $155 billion in 2025). This moderate expansion is driven by continued growth in cargo, particularly in time-sensitive shipments and e-commerce volumes (+2.6% growth in cargo tonne kilometers or CTK in 2026, slowing from +3.1% growth in 2025). Coupling these factors with tightening capacity, cargo yields are expected to remain stable (-0.5% on 2025) and elevated (approximately 30% above pre-pandemic levels), despite a broader slowdown in global trade.

Costs

Overall, the 2026 cost outlook points to a more balanced environment. Fuel relief is offset by rising non-fuel pressures, but the broader slowdown in inflation is helping to stabilize the cost base.

Fuel costs are expected to decline slightly to $252 billion in 2026 (-0.3% from $253 billion in 2025). The consensus forecast is for crude oil prices to decline to $62/barrel Brent (-11.0% on $70/barrel in 2025). Jet fuel prices are only expected to decline by 2.4% from $90/barrel in 2025 to $88/barrel in 2026 as the crack spread widens. The expiration of higher-cost hedges from 2025 should allow airlines to realize lower average prices that are closer to market levels. Fuel is set to account for 25.7% of total operating expenses, down from 26.8% in 2025.

Fuel efficiency gains are expected to be just 1.0% as supply chain issues continue to hamper fleet renewal and push the average aircraft age to over 15 years, the highest ever. Factoring in industry growth, fuel consumption is expected to increase to 106 billion gallons in 2026 (+2.7% on 103 billion gallons in 2025).

The cost of compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) is expected to grow to $1.7 billion for 2026 (up from $1.3 billion for 2025).

The incremental cost of airline purchases of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is expected to reach $4.5 billion in 2026, with the expectation of 2.4 million tonnes of SAF being available (0.8% of total fuel consumption).

Non-fuel costs are forecast to be $729 billion (+5.8% on $689 billion in 2025). Labor costs are now the largest cost component (28%) as wage growth continues to outpace inflation amid very tight labor market conditions. Despite strong hiring, the airline industry has struggled to restore employment productivity to 2019 levels, as rapid workforce growth has outpaced gains in output per employee amid ongoing operational and training challenges.

Maintenance costs are climbing due to the aging fleet and supply chain disruptions that affect the availability of parts. Lease rates have reached record highs, pushing up ownership costs. Airport and en-route charges continue to rise as well.

A weaker US dollar is expected to benefit non-USD-based airlines’ profitability and margins by reducing US dollar-denominated costs such as fuel, aircraft leases, and maintenance. IATA estimates that 55–60% of global airline costs are denominated in USD, compared to 50–55% on the revenue side. Based on this, a 1% weakening of the USD against global currencies may lift global airline profits by 1% and improve operating margins by around 0.05 ppt.

Risks, Constraints, and Opportunities

Supply chain challenges continue to constrain airlines’ ability to meet consumer demand for air transport. While some improvements are expected in 2026, the backlog in aircraft orders is expected to continue to grow. High load factors and yield stability are partially attributable to supply chain issues. However, the growth-constraining impact of supply chain challenges remains a drag on airline profitability. Even as aircraft deliveries are projected to increase significantly in 2026, the pace of new orders is outstripping production, causing the backlog to reach new highs and signaling that supply constraints, and their financial impact, will persist well beyond the near term.

The regulatory cost burden on airlines is significant. While significant deregulation is being pursued in the US, European regulators have yet to act on the recommendations of the Draghi report to make significant improvements in competitiveness by easing regulatory burdens. A case in point is the attempt to reform the European regulation on passenger rights (EU261), which has been watered down in ambition and convoluted with proposals to essentially make cabin baggage a passenger right irrespective of an airline’s business model or customer need.

Infrastructure constraints are not expected to ease significantly in 2026. However, US plans to renew its air traffic management system in the coming years would be a major improvement. While regulators have reaffirmed International Civil Aviation Organization principles for infrastructure charges, most have failed to use the principles to realize cost efficiencies. A case in point is London’s Heathrow Airport where the potential cost of expansion plans could render the airport uncompetitive without significant reforms.

Conflict continues to hamper airlines with significant costs. Airspace closures, GNSS interference, and re-routing for both political and safety reasons are constraining operations and reducing efficiencies.

Regional Roundup

Africa

Low GDP per capita across much of the continent limits discretionary spending, making air travel highly price sensitive and restricting its growth potential. Demand is further constrained by visa restrictions, restrictive bilateral agreements, and high passenger charges.

Moreover, African carriers face the highest unit costs globally, with average cost per ATK near 140 US cents, almost double the industry average. Among the many factors contributing to the high cost of operations in Africa are high fuel costs, fragmented markets, older fleets, and average corporate tax rates of 28% (the highest among all regions).

Until these constraints ease, Africa’s airline industry will operate with thin margins and limited resilience, even as traffic expands faster than the global average.

Asia Pacific

Passenger demand remains robust, with China and India leading regional expansion, driven by rising tourism activity and the growing middle classes. Easing visa requirements for Chinese group tours to South Korea and for visitors to China are expected to stimulate short-term inbound demand, particularly during peak holiday periods.

Overcapacity remains a challenge amid a slower recovery in international traffic putting pressure on yields. Deflationary pressures are also driving yields lower in China. Nevertheless, Asia Pacific remains the largest contributor to global traffic growth, with load factors projected to reach 84.4% in 2026, an all-time high for the region.

While Chinese exports to the US have declined, substitution effects have helped offset the impact of trade tensions, as Chinese goods have found alternative markets.

Europe

Europe is projected to deliver the strongest financial performance in absolute terms among all regions. European airlines show disciplined capacity management and strong load factors. Low-cost carriers are performing particularly well, expanding at double-digit rates and outperforming full-service carriers on net profit margin, fueled by strong intra-European traffic and leisure market. Traffic growth is moderating as the market matures and amid tepid economic conditions in the Euro zone where GDP growth lags the global average.

On the cost side, the strength of the Euro has provided a partial offset to inflationary pressures, particularly in fuel and leasing expenses, helping carriers maintain margins despite volatility in input costs.

The regulatory cost burden is increasing with the ReFuelEU initiative requiring a 2% SAF blend at EU airports from 2025. This coincides with mounting operational headwinds: labor unrest, drone disruptions, and persistent air traffic control bottlenecks.

Latin America

Traffic growth remains robust driven by economic stability and enhanced intra-regional connectivity. Demand between the Americas has softened, though this has been offset by increased regional flows and a solid transatlantic performance, highlighting the adaptability of carriers in the face of shifting travel patterns.

Operating profitability is anticipated to rebound again in 2026, benefiting from the gradual strengthening of the region’s fundamentals. However, currency fluctuations remain a critical headwind. Although 2025 saw temporary relief with local currencies appreciating, volatility is expected to continue to challenge cost management and profitability.

With several major carriers in the region realizing the benefits of Chapter 11 restructuring, the region’s environment has shifted from crisis-driven survival to cautious, efficiency-focused rebuilding.

Middle East

The Middle East is the strongest region in terms of net profit margin and profit per passenger. This performance attests to the difference a positive regulatory operating environment can make, and to the region’s strategic position as a global connecting hub.

Passenger demand continues to be robust, driven by long-haul traffic and the expansion of hub carriers. Governments and airlines are doubling down on infrastructure investments to secure long-term growth. While geopolitical tensions remain a feature of the regional landscape, they are not expected to negatively impact growth, particularly as efforts to secure lasting peace continue.

Middle Eastern carriers are mitigating aircraft delivery delays through retrofit programs and fleet life extensions, though capacity growth will remain constrained in the near term.

North America

North American profitability remains stable, but the region ceded its most profitable ranking to Europe in 2025.

The United States suffered stagnating overall growth and a domestic market contraction in the face of policy uncertainty around tariffs, tighter immigration enforcement dampening both inbound and domestic travel, and a lengthy government shutdown. Capacity constraints, pilot shortages, engine reliability issues, and rising labor costs continue to restrict expansion.

Despite these hurdles, airlines managed to protect margins in 2025, supported by stable yields and lower fuel prices. Performance, however, varies by business model. Low-cost carriers are under pressure, heavily exposed to the shrinking US domestic segment, growing passenger preferences for premium services, and facing the disadvantages of single-type fleets amid supply chain disruptions.

Looking ahead, 2026 is expected to see some easing of these challenges and the opportunity for a gradual increase in demand.

Travelers’ Viewpoint

Air travel continues to deliver exceptional value to consumers. Average real return air fares in 2025 US dollars were 34.7% cheaper compared to 2015. And passengers are expected to benefit from efficiency gains and competitive forces that will likely see 2026 average return air fares at 36.8% below 2015 level.

An IATA public opinion poll conducted in October-November 2025 (14 countries, 6,500 respondents who have taken at least one trip in the last year) revealed that 97% of travelers expressed satisfaction with their last travel experience. Moreover, 88% agreed that air travel makes their lives better, 78% agreed that air travel is good value for money, and 87% said they cared about their ability to fly in future.

Passengers are counting on a safe, sustainable, efficient, and profitable airline industry. The IATA public opinion polling demonstrated the important role that travelers see the airline industry playing:

90% agreed that air connectivity is critical to the economy

88% said that air travel has a positive impact on societies, and

82% said that the global air transport network is a key contributor to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

83% care about the success of the aviation industry

The air transport industry is committed to its goal of achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Travelers are expressing high levels of confidence in this endeavor with 79% agreeing that the industry is demonstrating commitment to work together to achieve its ambitious goal, 77% agreeing that aviation leaders are taking the climate challenge seriously.",https://www.4hoteliers.com/ogm/4Hoteliers_Logo.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 20:57:44.978024

In a rallying cry for common sense in 2026, the tycoon insists the path to lower inflation and cheaper power rests in stripping away over-regulation and bureaucracy.

He warned: “We desperately need energy bills to fall.

“This will only happen if the Government gets tough on big companies gaming the system.

“It means ending bonkers stuff like paying wind farms over £1billion to turn off on windy days.”

But, despite that waste, he insists the world is moving away from oil and gas towards green energy technology.

The Octopus Energy chief explained: “Firstly, they’re becoming more affordable. Just three years ago, gas prices sent bills sky high and trashed our economy.

“As long as we’re hooked on them, we’re at the mercy of dictators and foreign governments.

“More from the North Sea may help — but it’s a drop in the ocean and won’t save us from these forces.

“Secondly, electric technologies just keep getting better. The cost of solar, batteries and electric cars is plummeting. When you buy gas from Qatar it’s gone the moment you burn it. Solar panels generate power for decades.”

Mr Jackson also called for a return to old-fashioned customer service in this age of AI.

He urged firms to start answering the phone instead of hiding behind “crappy systems and computers that say no”.

That — and slashing costs added to bills to fund infrastructure “we don’t need” — is the only way to get the economy moving again.

If ministers cut the rot he predicts a brighter future where green tech delivers energy independence, economic growth and lower family bills.

He said: “Dining out has become more expensive so our premium ranges are really popular. More customers will choose restaurant quality food at home.”

He said the big weekly shop is back in fashion as people flock back to work.

Innovation And Future Plans

The airline’s fleet modernization strategy centers on introducing next-generation aircraft such as the Boeing 777X and the Airbus A350. On order are 35 Boeing 777-8s and a substantial 235 Boeing 777-9s, forming the core of the future long-haul fleet, alongside 59 Airbus A350-900s scheduled for delivery. In addition, the airline has ordered 30 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, split evenly between 15 787-10s and 15 787-8s, adding further flexibility and efficiency. These aircraft offer significantly improved fuel efficiency, longer range, and enhanced passenger comfort, allowing the airline to progressively replace older widebody jets while improving operational reliability.

A key part of the passenger experience upgrade is the implementation of Starlink high-speed satellite internet across the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 fleets. This technology enables faster and more reliable connectivity at cruising altitude, supporting streaming, messaging, and productivity throughout the flight. When combined with new-generation aircraft deliveries and updated cabin products, this initiative reflects a broader effort to deliver a consistently modern and connected onboard experience.

Sustainability remains a central pillar of the airline’s long-term strategy, particularly in reducing emissions on long-haul operations. The introduction of aircraft such as the 777X, A350, and 787, each designed with lower fuel burn and reduced emissions, supports these goals, alongside operational efficiencies and the use of sustainable aviation fuel. Expansion plans to new global destinations will be closely tied to these efficiencies, enabling network growth while maintaining a strong focus on environmental responsibility.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/largestwidebody.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-01 18:12:12.939987

They don’t sell celluloid — they sell star power. If you have an established icon like Clara Bow, you sell It: allure, magnetism, and the special sparkle that turns a performer into a phenomenon. If you have a rising force like Ann Sheridan, you sell Oomph: that impossible-to-bottle mystique and sex appeal that storms the box office before the critics even learn her name.

It and Oomph. That’s the formula.

For renewable fuels, that moment arrives in 2026. The gallons of green liquid? Not the star anymore. The real value lies in the attributes — the verified, tradeable, financeable proof of carbon benefit.

Like:

• Energy Attribute Certificates (RECs, Guarantees of Origin)

• Zero-Emission Credits (rewarding firm, carbon-free generation)

• Low-Carbon Fuel Synthesis Attributes (SAFc and friends)

And when you look at eSAF, the ultimate Oomph emerges: small modular nuclear reactors paired with hydrogen and fuel synthesis — precision-engineered to electrify Wall Street. And this isn’t theory — the deals are already in the news.

The It Girl: Aemetis Biogas

If “It” is that intangible quality that takes something merely promising and makes it irresistible, Aemetis has it in spades.

Their subsidiary Aemetis Biogas LLC has just received funds from the sale of $17 million of federal clean energy tax credits — including Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credits and Section 48 Investment Tax Credits. This wasn’t a paper shuffle — it delivered $15 million in net cash into the business, after transaction costs. Breakdown:

~$12M from Section 48 ITC tied to constructing a dairy digester that’s already producing biogas

~$5M from Section 45Z PTC tied to renewable natural gas production during 2025

And that’s just the first act. Aemetis expects:

Significantly higher 45Z credit values as volumes scale and guidance strengthens

An additional $10.5 million Section 45C credit in 2026 (already IRS + DOE approved)

That is It Factor economics: proven molecules + proven metadata = proven money. This isn’t Hollywood hype. It’s recurring cash flow with receipts.

The Oomph Girl: XCF Global

If oomph is the quality that makes investors reach for their checkbook before the set is even built — XCF Global has it. They’ve announced a sweeping non-binding MOU with IP3, Southern Energy Renewables, and DevvStream to explore an integrated model for:

SMR nuclear power

Electro-sustainable aviation fuel

Tokenized, verifiable environmental attributes

This is how high-value compliance markets get fed — continuously, reliably, and at industrial scale. The collaboration envisions:

SMR-generated electricity powering both electrolysis + fuel synthesis

Excess zero-carbon power supporting booming AI/data-center customers

Digital MRV + provenance tracking ensuring every claim checks out

“Book-and-claim” SAF structures enabling climate benefits to fly globally even before fuel does

This isn’t yesterday’s offset story. This is data-driven decarbonization that Wall Street can underwrite. And they’re doing it with a narrative investors already adore: nuclear = energy security + industry revival + jobs + big-ticket growth. Nothing has more Oomph right now.

They Said It

“This tax credit sale represents an important step in monetizing federal clean fuel transferable tax incentives and establishing a new recurring source of cash flow,” said Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis. “This is our first sale of a Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit from dairy RNG, and we expect additional Section 45Z transactions in 2026 and future years from ongoing renewable natural gas production, along with additional Section 48 transactions from ongoing digester construction. With the completion of $95 million of ITC transactions and today’s first Section 45Z sale, we are executing our tax credit monetization strategy. We expect federal 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credits to be a rapidly growing source of operating cash flow to support the expansion of production and new job creation.”

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented: “This MOU reflects XCF’s disciplined approach to evaluating infrastructure and partnerships that can strengthen the scalability, reliability, and carbon performance of next-generation sustainable aviation fuels. Firm, zero-carbon power is an important enabler for eSAF pathways, and this collaboration allows us to assess how integrated power, fuel, and environmental-attribute frameworks could support broader adoption of clean fuels.”

RDML (Ret.) Mike Hewitt, Chief Executive Officer of IP3, added: “Clean, reliable nuclear power is increasingly being pursued as foundational infrastructure for American energy security and industrial growth. We are excited to explore a strategic relationship with XCF, DevvStream, and Southern, including the potential deployment of small modular reactor technology to provide firm power and support e‑SAF production for European markets. IP3’s business model to develop infrastructure projects to privatize Small Modular Reactors for multiple offtakers such as AI and data centers that support government and commercial requirements. We believe pairing firm power development with practical environmental‑asset design and monetization can create a differentiated platform that meets real customer demand while delivering the transparency the market expects.”

Sunny Trinh, Chief Executive Officer of DevvStream, commented:“Together, we are exploring real-world asset and tokenized environmental-asset frameworks with the potential to unlock additional value, improve liquidity, and help lower the delivered cost of clean energy and fuels. We see this as a potential America-first model that combines U.S. resources, digital infrastructure, and scalable markets.”

Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy, added: “This MOU reflects our focus on putting American energy, infrastructure, and production first. As the development of advanced nuclear platforms gains momentum, we believe the goal of developing and deploying firm, domestic power is becoming essential for fuels, manufacturing, and data-driven industries. We are committed to exploring how nuclear power, combined with U.S. biomass resources, can enable an integrated, multi-product approach that strengthens U.S. industrial leadership while remaining globally competitive.”

Oomph Wins the Audition. Persistence Wins the Franchise.

Look — right now, the financial markets care less about feasible and more about financeable. Investors want:

bankable revenue streams

compliance premiums

physical + digital verification

infrastructure that already exists or can be reused

Which is why Aemetis’ bolt-on model might be the most powerful story of all: Oomph gets you noticed. Persistence gets you greenlit.

Nuclear may be the red-hot starlet of the energy world — stealing headlines and dazzling regulators — but the projects that endure are the ones already delivering today.

Fiji Airways has issued a travel alert for two of its routes in the region, warning customers of the possibility of disruption owing to fuel shortages at the airports of destinations in these islands. The air operator, however, has confirmed the operation of flights on the routes Funafuti and Nadi-Vava’u, but there will be constraints owing to fuel shortages at the airports involved.

The flights to Funafuti will operate under restrictions until January 15, 2026, according to the airline, as the plane will have to take more contingency fuel from Fiji. The impact of the additional weight of the fuel will result in the plane carrying reduced capacity, and the flights will not operate at their normal capacity. This will result in the possibility of carrying out passenger and cargo offloads to enhance the weight and balance of the plane. The same will be the scenario for the flights operating on the Nadi-Vava’u route, as there will be a scarcity of fuel until January 9, 2026.

Impact on Passengers and Luggage

Fiji Airways has advised that due to weight limitations, both passengers and their checked baggage may be offloaded from flights where necessary. Affected passengers and luggage will be accommodated on the next available service, subject to operational availability.

To manage the situation, passengers are being urged to carry essential items and overnight necessities in their hand luggage, ensuring that it falls within standard carry-on rules. This recommendation is designed to minimize inconvenience and ensure passengers have what they need during their travels.

Airline’s Efforts to Address the Fuel Shortage

Fiji Airways has emphasized that the fuel shortage is temporary, with fuel supplies expected to be restored by mid-January for Funafuti and by January 9, 2026 for Nadi–Vava’u. While these disruptions are inconvenient, the airline is working to ensure that passengers can continue their journeys with minimal delays.

Future Travel Impacts: Long-Term Effects on Regional Operations

While the current disruptions will be short-term, Fiji Airways’s ongoing adjustments to its fuel strategy and capacity planning are likely to have longer-term impacts on the airline’s regional operations. The airline’s reliance on contingency fuel from Fiji and the limited weight capacity of aircraft can affect flight schedules, especially on high-demand routes like Funafuti and Nadi–Vava’u. As the airline prepares for an increase in international travel demand, particularly for leisure tourism in the Pacific region, these fuel-related disruptions may prompt future improvements to regional flight scheduling and fuel distribution strategies to ensure consistent service delivery.

Fiji Airways’ efforts to return to normal flight operations after fuel supplies are restored will likely provide valuable insights into regional aviation dynamics and how to better manage fuel-related challenges in the future. As international tourism rebounds across the Pacific, maintaining efficient, sustainable flight operations will be critical for the airline to meet growing demand, especially from international travelers seeking tropical destinations.

Future Focus: Improving Sustainability and Regional Connectivity

Looking toward the future, Fiji Airways is likely to focus on further optimizing fuel management and enhancing regional connectivity. This may include exploring sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) options and innovative fuel solutions that could prevent similar issues in the long term. With a growing number of tourists heading to Pacific island nations, it will be essential for Fiji Airways to ensure reliable service while reducing its environmental impact.

Additionally, expanding partnerships with local airports and governments to streamline fuel supply chains and increase airlift capacity in remote destinations like Funafuti and Nadi–Vava’u will be key to minimizing operational challenges in the coming years. This will also support tourism growth by making travel to these regions more accessible and efficient.

Managing Short-Term Disruptions for Long-Term Growth

The recent fuel shortages and associated flight restrictions within the Funafuti and Nadi – Vava’u routes are only temporary; however, they underscore the value of long-term planning in terms of fuel management and Pacific connectivity strategies for Fiji Airways. This aviation company will continue to develop approaches in order to optimize future performance in light of increasing demand in the Pacific tourism industry.

Emirates strengthened its standing in 2025 as the world's largest international airline, carrying 55.6 million passengers across almost 180,580 flights and reinforcing Dubai's role as a central hub for long-haul air travel. The carrier said the scale of its operations during the year equated to circling the Earth more than 29,000 times, underlining the breadth of its global network at a time when international aviation demand continued to normalise after years of disruption.

The airline also placed orders for 73 new aircraft, signalling confidence in sustained long-term growth and in the resilience of global travel demand. Fleet expansion remains a central pillar of Emirates' strategy, aimed at maintaining capacity on high-traffic routes while opening or strengthening links to emerging markets across Asia, Africa and the Americas. Industry analysts view the order book as one of the most closely watched indicators of the carrier's outlook, given its dependence on wide-body aircraft and ultra-long-haul connectivity.

The airline's expanding global footprint in 2025 was framed by a milestone anniversary, with Emirates marking four decades since the launch of its operations in October. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the airline said the year reflected a“clear vision for shaping the future of travel through sustained excellence”, pointing to operational consistency, service standards and network breadth as defining features of its performance.

Passenger numbers remained below pre-pandemic peaks on certain routes due to aircraft delivery delays affecting the wider aviation sector, yet load factors were described by industry data providers as robust across most regions. Demand on Europe-Asia and Middle East-Americas corridors continued to anchor traffic flows, while routes to South Asia and parts of Africa saw steady growth, driven by both leisure and labour mobility.

Operationally, Emirates' near-180,000 flights highlighted the scale at which the airline manages complex scheduling and logistics. Aviation specialists note that maintaining punctuality and service quality across such volumes requires heavy investment in crew training, digital systems and ground operations. Emirates has increasingly leaned on data-driven planning to optimise turnaround times at Dubai International Airport, one of the world's busiest for international passengers.

The aircraft order announced during the year included a mix of next-generation wide-body jets intended to replace older models and support future expansion. These aircraft are expected to deliver improved fuel efficiency and lower emissions per seat, a key consideration as regulators and investors place greater scrutiny on aviation's environmental footprint. While long-haul flying remains carbon-intensive, Emirates has signalled incremental steps towards sustainability, including operational efficiencies and participation in sustainable aviation fuel initiatives, though large-scale adoption remains constrained by supply and cost.

Competition among global network carriers intensified during 2025, with rivals in Europe, North America and Asia restoring capacity and adding frequencies on overlapping routes. Despite this, Emirates retained its edge in international passenger volumes, largely due to its hub-and-spoke model centred on Dubai, which allows the airline to aggregate demand from multiple regions and deploy high-capacity aircraft efficiently. Analysts say this structure continues to give Emirates flexibility that point-to-point operators struggle to replicate on intercontinental routes.

The airline's performance also had broader implications for Dubai's economy. Aviation remains a cornerstone of the emirate's tourism, trade and services sectors, supporting thousands of jobs directly and indirectly. Passenger throughput through Dubai International Airport feeds into hospitality, retail and logistics, reinforcing the city's positioning as a global crossroads. Government data have consistently linked airline capacity growth with higher visitor numbers and stronger non-oil economic activity.

Internally, Emirates focused on workforce stability after years of volatility across the aviation labour market. Recruitment and training programmes were expanded to ensure sufficient pilots, cabin crew and engineers to support the enlarged schedule. Industry observers note that staff availability has become as critical as aircraft supply in determining how quickly airlines can scale operations.

Rostec’s “Russian Helicopters” holding has officially begun flight tests of the Mi-34M1, a modern light single-engine multipurpose helicopter designed entirely around Russian-made technologies. The maiden flight marks an important milestone in restoring a segment long dominated by foreign light helicopters.

Mi-34M1 Enters Flight Testing Phase

The Mi-34M1 completed its first test flight lasting around ten minutes, during which engineers evaluated the helicopter’s stability, controllability, and structural loads. The aircraft performed standard horizontal flight maneuvers and turns, allowing specialists to assess how key systems behave under real aerodynamic stress.

According to Rostec, the helicopter demonstrated predictable handling and strong maneuverability—two qualities essential for training, monitoring, and civilian operations. The test campaign confirms that the Mi-34M1 is progressing steadily toward certification.

Powered by the New VK-650V Engine

At the heart of the Mi-34M1 is the VK-650V turboshaft engine, developed by the United Engine Corporation under Rostec. This engine represents a major achievement, as it is the first Russian-designed powerplant for light helicopters in the up-to-four-ton takeoff weight category.

Delivering 650 horsepower at takeoff, the VK-650V is built around a modular architecture that simplifies maintenance and extends service life. It is also equipped with a digital full-authority engine control (FADEC) system, improving fuel efficiency, reliability, and pilot workload management—especially important for training and private aviation.

Key Specifications (Preliminary)

While certification testing is still underway, the Mi-34M1 is expected to feature the following performance characteristics:

The Road Ahead: Buybacks and Dividends Looking toward the remainder of 2026, the market is anticipating a strategic pivot in Delta’s capital allocation.
Final Assessment for the 2026 Investor As we move into 2026, Delta Air Lines stands as a testament to the power of disciplined financial management and brand positioning.","As the global financial markets ring in 2026, a stark divergence has emerged between the high-flying valuations of the broader indices and the grounded, cash-generating reality of the industrial sector. With the S&P 500 trading at a historically steep forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23x, driven by a multi-year surge in technology and artificial intelligence, investors are increasingly scouring the market for ""quality value""—companies with fortress balance sheets, dominant market positions, and valuations that have yet to catch up to their fundamental earnings power.

Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) has emerged at the forefront of this search. While the broader market appears priced for perfection, Delta enters 2026 trading at a modest 9.5x forward earnings, despite coming off a fiscal 2025 that saw record-breaking revenue and a massive reduction in long-term debt. This valuation gap represents one of the most significant opportunities in the large-cap space, positioning the Atlanta-based carrier as a top pick for value-oriented portfolios in the coming year.

The Crusade Against Debt and the Premium Pivot

The story of Delta’s ascent to a top value pick for 2026 began in earnest during its ""crusade against debt"" throughout 2024 and 2025. Following the turbulence of the early 2020s, Delta’s management team, led by CEO Ed Bastian, executed a disciplined capital allocation strategy that prioritized balance sheet repair over aggressive capacity expansion. By the end of 2025, Delta successfully slashed its adjusted net debt from over $21 billion to approximately $15.3 billion, reclaiming its investment-grade status across all major credit agencies. This deleveraging has not only lowered interest expenses but has also cleared the runway for increased shareholder returns in 2026.

Central to this financial transformation has been Delta’s strategic pivot toward ""premiumization."" Throughout 2025, the airline saw a structural shift in consumer behavior, where high-income travelers increasingly opted for premium cabins, including Delta One and Premium Select. This shift was underscored by the record-breaking performance of Delta’s partnership with American Express (NYSE: AXP), which generated over $7 billion in high-margin remuneration in 2025 alone. By focusing on the high-end consumer, Delta has successfully insulated itself from the price wars that have traditionally plagued the lower-cost segments of the industry.

Winners and Losers in the New Aviation Landscape

In the competitive landscape of early 2026, Delta’s ""premium-first"" strategy has created a widening moat between it and its peers. United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL) has remained a formidable competitor, also benefiting from international expansion and premium demand, but it continues to carry a heavier debt load than Delta. Meanwhile, American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) has struggled to achieve the same level of margin expansion, as it grapples with higher operational complexities and a slower path to deleveraging.

The real losers in this environment have been the traditional low-cost carriers. Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV), long the darling of the budget sector, spent much of 2025 undergoing a radical transformation—including the introduction of assigned seating and premium cabin options—in a desperate bid to capture the high-yield travelers that Delta has already secured. As fuel prices and labor costs remained elevated through 2025, the thin margins of the ""no-frills"" model became increasingly unsustainable, forcing a consolidation of the market that has ultimately benefited Delta’s pricing power.

Resilience Amidst Industry Constraints

The wider significance of Delta’s current position lies in its ability to thrive despite persistent industry-wide supply constraints. As of January 1, 2026, the aviation industry continues to be hamstrung by aircraft delivery delays from both Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Airbus (OTC:EADSY). While these delays have limited the industry’s ability to add new seats, they have inadvertently acted as a floor for ticket prices. Delta’s older but well-maintained fleet and its superior operational reliability have allowed it to maintain record load factors—projected at 84% for 2026—while competitors struggle with grounded planes and maintenance backlogs.

Furthermore, a significant tailwind for the airline sector in 2026 is the cooling of global energy prices. Brent crude is forecast to average $58 per barrel this year, down from $66 in 2025. For an airline of Delta’s scale, this reduction in its largest variable cost represents a massive boost to the bottom line. When combined with the ""premiumization"" trend, Delta is entering 2026 with a rare combination of falling costs and rising yields, a scenario that historically precedes significant stock price appreciation.

The Road Ahead: Buybacks and Dividends

Looking toward the remainder of 2026, the market is anticipating a strategic pivot in Delta’s capital allocation. With the debt-to-EBITDAR ratio now sitting comfortably at 2.0x, analysts expect the company to transition from debt repayment to aggressive shareholder returns. Short-term possibilities include a significant hike in the quarterly dividend and the potential announcement of a multi-billion dollar share buyback program, which would be the first major repurchase since the pre-pandemic era.

However, challenges remain. The industry must still navigate a complex regulatory environment and the ongoing pressure to invest in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Delta’s ability to integrate these environmental costs without eroding its 11.5% operating margin will be a key metric for investors to watch. Additionally, while the ""K-shaped"" economy has favored Delta’s premium focus, any broader slowdown in high-end consumer spending could test the resilience of its 2026 earnings guidance.

Final Assessment for the 2026 Investor

As we move into 2026, Delta Air Lines stands as a testament to the power of disciplined financial management and brand positioning. In a market where many stocks are trading at valuations that assume decades of uninterrupted growth, Delta offers a ""margin of safety"" that is increasingly rare. With a consensus analyst price target of $82—representing a nearly 20% upside from current levels—the stock is priced as a cyclical airline but is performing like a high-quality industrial powerhouse.

For investors, the key takeaways are clear: Delta has fixed its balance sheet, captured the most profitable segment of the travel market, and is now poised to benefit from lower fuel costs and restricted supply. While the tech sector may continue to capture headlines, the real value in 2026 is likely to be found in the blue skies of the aviation sector. Investors should keep a close eye on quarterly earnings reports for confirmation of the promised buybacks, which could serve as the final catalyst to close the valuation gap between Delta and the broader market.

“The Biofuels Production Incentive supports Canadian jobs, Canadian feedstocks, and Canadian fuel supply, helping keep clean fuel investment and production anchored in Canada amid ongoing trade and policy uncertainty.
“While the Biofuels Production Incentive is a positive short-term measure for 2026 and 2027, it does not fully close the gap with U.S. production subsidies.
Long-term competitiveness will require complementary, structural measures that provide certainty for investment in Canadian renewable fuel production and feedstock supply chains.
“Advanced Biofuels Canada Association encourages provinces and territories to engage actively at the federal-provincial-territorial table to deliver durable, long-term investment-ready solutions.","VANCOUVER, CANADA, January 1, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ -- ""The Biofuels Production Incentive takes effect today, providing immediate support to protect Canadian biofuel production capacity and strengthen Canada’s energy security,” said Fred Ghatala, President of Advanced Biofuels Canada Association.

“The Biofuels Production Incentive was announced by Prime Minister Carney on September 5, 2025, and today marks the shift from policy intent to delivery.

“Canadian producers have been operating at a competitive disadvantage since the introduction of the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act and the Clean Fuel Production Credit, which significantly lowered U.S. production costs and reshaped North American capital flows.

“The Biofuels Production Incentive supports Canadian jobs, Canadian feedstocks, and Canadian fuel supply, helping keep clean fuel investment and production anchored in Canada amid ongoing trade and policy uncertainty. Biofuels are an immediately deployable solution that reduces emissions while supporting rural economies, well-paying jobs, domestic feedstocks like canola, and greater energy security.

“Advanced Biofuels Canada Association represents producers of biodiesel, ethanol, renewable diesel, renewable gasoline, and sustainable aviation fuel, which are blended into the transportation fuels Canadians rely on every day.

“While the Biofuels Production Incentive is a positive short-term measure for 2026 and 2027, it does not fully close the gap with U.S. production subsidies. Long-term competitiveness will require complementary, structural measures that provide certainty for investment in Canadian renewable fuel production and feedstock supply chains.

“The federal–provincial–territorial table on low-carbon fuels is already established, and it is the next critical step to align long-term policies that keep Canadian biofuel production stable, thriving, and anchored in Canada, rather than leaving Canada’s supply and competitiveness exposed to foreign policy decisions.

“Provinces have a central role to play in ensuring Canada remains attractive for capital investments in biofuel production, feedstock processing, and renewable fuel infrastructure, while ensuring that farmers and rural communities capture the long-term jobs, revenues, and value-added benefits these supply chains generate.

“Advanced Biofuels Canada Association encourages provinces and territories to engage actively at the federal-provincial-territorial table to deliver durable, long-term investment-ready solutions. Coordinated policy action will protect existing facilities, attract new capital, and keep biofuel investment and production in Canada.

“Today’s implementation is important groundwork, and the focus now must be on durable policy frameworks that allow the sector to grow.”

Throughout 2025, the World Bank and IMF recorded a 7% annual decline in commodity prices, a trend that is forecasted to repeat in 2026.

Summary and Investor Takeaways The global commodity market of 2026 is defined by a fierce battle for dominance in a low-margin world.","As the world rings in 2026, the global commodity markets are locked in a baffling contradiction. Despite a four-year downward trend that has pushed the broad commodity index to six-year lows, production levels for everything from crude oil to battery metals are reaching historic highs. This ""Production Paradox"" is reshaping the global economy, as major producers choose to defend market share and leverage low-cost efficiencies rather than curb supply to support prices.

The immediate implications are a boon for consumers and manufacturers, who are enjoying the lowest input costs since the pre-pandemic era. However, for the commodity giants and the nations that depend on them, the environment has become a brutal ""survival of the fittest."" With Brent crude hovering near $60 per barrel and agricultural surpluses mounting, the market is bracing for a year where volume is the only shield against vanishing margins.

The Race to the Bottom: A Timeline of the 2026 Glut

The current state of oversupply did not happen overnight. It is the culmination of a multi-year investment cycle that began in 2022 and 2023, when record-high prices incentivized massive capital expenditures in new extraction technologies and expanded acreage. By late 2024, these projects began coming online just as global demand—particularly from a slowing Chinese industrial sector—started to cool. Throughout 2025, the World Bank and IMF recorded a 7% annual decline in commodity prices, a trend that is forecasted to repeat in 2026.

Key players in this drama include the OPEC+ alliance, which has struggled to maintain production discipline in the face of surging output from non-member nations. The United States and Guyana have emerged as the primary disruptors in the energy sector, with the U.S. Permian Basin reaching unprecedented efficiency levels. Meanwhile, in the metals sector, Indonesia and China have aggressively expanded nickel and lithium processing capacities, deliberately maintaining high output to crash prices and drive higher-cost Western competitors out of the market. This ""Strategic Market Share Defense"" has left the market in a state of bearish stability, where supply remains stubbornly high despite the lack of a price floor.

Winners and Losers in the Low-Cost Era

In this environment, the clear winners are the ""low-cost leaders"" who can remain profitable even at depressed price levels. ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) stands at the forefront of this group. By leveraging its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources and its advantaged assets in Guyana, ExxonMobil has lowered its breakeven costs to near $30 per barrel. While other energy firms are slashing dividends, ExxonMobil is entering 2026 with a plan to return $20 billion to shareholders, proving that in a low-price world, scale and efficiency are the ultimate competitive advantages.

Conversely, companies like Albemarle (NYSE: ALB) are in a defensive crouch. As the global leader in lithium, Albemarle has been forced to slash its capital expenditure by 65% over the last two years to preserve cash. While they remain a ""strategic survivor"" due to their high-quality assets in Nevada and Australia, the current glut has forced them to move away from fixed-price contracts to dynamic pricing models, hoping to capture any sudden 2026 rebounds. In the agricultural space, Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE: ADM) is navigating thin margins by pivoting toward the ""Bioeconomy."" ADM is restructuring to exit low-margin animal nutrition segments and focusing on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstocks, a move intended to create value-added premiums over traditional, oversupplied grain trading.

The Wider Significance: Geopolitics and the ""Dark Fleet""

The 2026 commodity landscape is not just about supply and demand; it is a mirror of a fragmenting geopolitical order. The persistence of high production is increasingly seen as a tool of economic warfare. By keeping prices low, dominant producers like Indonesia (in nickel) and the U.S. (in oil) are effectively ""starving"" competitors who lack the same subsidies or geological advantages. This trend fits into a broader movement toward ""re-globalization,"" where supply chains are being rerouted to avoid tariff volatility and geopolitical chokepoints.

Furthermore, the rise of the ""Dark Fleet""—a shadow network of tankers carrying sanctioned oil from Russia and Iran—continues to distort market signals. These ""ghost supplies"" keep global inventories higher than official data suggests, complicating the efforts of regulators and central banks to manage inflation. Additionally, the maritime world is bracing for a permanent shift in logistics. With the Suez Canal and Red Sea remaining high-risk zones due to regional instability, shippers are now budgeting for the Cape of Good Hope route as a standard, adding significant lead times and costs that offset some of the benefits of lower commodity prices.

The 2026 Outlook: Shocks on the Horizon

Looking ahead, the primary risk to this era of abundance is a sudden, climate-driven supply shock. Predictive models for 2026 suggest a strong La Niña phase, which historically disrupts harvests in the U.S. Midwest and Brazil while causing flooding in Australian mines. While the market is currently oversupplied, a simultaneous failure in major agricultural and mining hubs could lead to ""localized scarcity"" and violent price spikes, catching over-leveraged buyers off guard.

In the short term, companies will likely continue their strategic pivots. We expect to see more ""green steel"" initiatives from miners like Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO), which is preparing to ship the first major commercial volumes from its Simandou project in Guinea this year. This high-grade iron ore is essential for low-carbon manufacturing, representing a shift from volume-based growth to ""purity-based"" growth. The challenge for 2026 will be managing the transition from a period of glut to a future where supply is increasingly dictated by carbon footprints and geopolitical alignment.

Summary and Investor Takeaways

The global commodity market of 2026 is defined by a fierce battle for dominance in a low-margin world. The ""Production Paradox"" has created a landscape where the strongest players are doubling down on output to squeeze out the weak. For investors, the key takeaway is that ""low-cost"" is no longer just a buzzword; it is a prerequisite for survival. The era of high-beta commodity plays is over, replaced by a focus on operational excellence and balance sheet strength.

Moving forward, the market will be characterized by extreme sensitivity to supply chain disruptions and climate events. Investors should watch for the impact of La Niña on grain prices and any further escalation in trade tariffs that could disrupt the flow of battery metals. While the headline prices remain low, the underlying volatility remains high, making 2026 a year for cautious, quality-focused investing in the resource sector.

BNEWS Việc quyết liệt chuyển đổi xanh gắn với chuyển đổi số, BSR không chỉ nâng cao năng lực cạnh tranh, phát triển bền vững mà còn tiếp tục khẳng định vai trò trụ cột bảo đảm an ninh năng lượng quốc gia.

Với việc quyết liệt thực hiện chuyển đổi xanh gắn với chuyển đổi số, Công ty Cổ phần Lọc hoá dầu Bình Sơn (BSR)-đơn vị thành viên của Tập đoàn Công nghiệp-Năng lượng Quốc gia Việt Nam (Petrovietnam) không chỉ nâng cao năng lực cạnh tranh, tạo nền tảng phát triển bền vững mà còn tiếp tục khẳng định vai trò trụ cột trong bảo đảm an ninh năng lượng quốc gia trong giai đoạn mới.

*Chuyển đổi xanh để phát triển bền vững

Tổng Giám đốc BSR Nguyễn Việt Thắng cho biết trước xu hướng chuyển dịch năng lượng toàn cầu và cam kết giảm phát thải carbon (Net zero) của Việt Nam, BSR đã nỗ lực nghiên cứu, phát triển và sản xuất nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững (SAF - Sustainable Aviation Fuel). SAF là sản phẩm được nhà máy lọc dầu Dung Quất của BSR phối trộn từ cấu tử bền vững (SBC/Neat SAF) và Jet A-1, phát triển trên cơ sở tiêu chuẩn xăng máy bay Jet A-1 theo tiêu chuẩn kỹ thuật cho nhiên liệu tuabine hàng không chứa hydrocarbon tổng hợp (tiêu chuẩn ASTM D-7566), đảm bảo chất lượng cho động cơ turbine hàng không.

Đây cũng là sản phẩm nằm trong danh mục sản phẩm chủ lực của Petrovietnam và khẳng định quyết tâm của Petrovietnam trong triển khai Nghị quyết số 57-NQ/TW ngày 22/12/2024 của Bộ Chính trị “về đột phá phát triển khoa học, công nghệ, đổi mới sáng tạo và chuyển đổi số quốc gia”. BSR tự hào là một trong những đơn vị tiên phong triển khai thương mại hóa SAF, hướng tới cung cấp giải pháp năng lượng sạch cho các hãng hàng không trong nước và quốc tế, -ông Nguyễn Việt Thắng nhấn mạnh.

Theo ông Hoàng Thanh Sơn - Trưởng ban Nghiên cứu Phát triển BSR, sản phẩm SAF của BSR đã được tổ chức SGS Germany GmbH (Đức) cấp 2 chứng nhận quan trọng gồm ISCC CORSIA và ISCC EU, xác nhận đạt tiêu chuẩn quốc tế trong phối trộn, sản xuất, lưu trữ và thương mại sản phẩm SAF. Việc sở hữu chứng nhận ISCC giúp BSR đủ điều kiện xuất khẩu sản phẩm SAF ra thị trường quốc tế, đặc biệt là thị trường EU - nơi có các quy định nghiêm ngặt nhất về phát thải và năng lượng tái tạo. Chứng nhận cũng là minh chứng cho nỗ lực của BSR trong việc đáp ứng các tiêu chuẩn sản xuất xanh, bền vững và có trách nhiệm với môi trường, là lợi thế để công ty mở rộng hợp tác và ký kết hợp đồng thương mại với các đối tác yêu cầu cao về tính bền vững. Ngoài ra, sản phẩm SAF cũng được BSR hoàn thiện đầy đủ tài liệu kỹ thuật, quy trình sản xuất, pha chế nội bộ và tiêu chuẩn cơ sở TCCS 23:2024-BSR. BSR đã phối hợp chặt chẽ với Công ty TNHH MTV Nhiên liệu Hàng không Việt Nam (Skypec), các hãng hàng không và đơn vị vận chuyển để thiết lập chuỗi cung ứng SAF khép kín đầu tiên tại Việt Nam, từ nhập khẩu nguyên liệu, phối trộn, kiểm soát chất lượng đến cung ứng cho các công ty nhiên liệu hàng không và cấp phát cho các chuyến bay nội địa, quốc tế. Theo kế hoạch, BSR sẽ triển khai sản xuất các lô SAF quy mô lớn hơn và tiến tới thương mại hóa trong thời gian tới, ông Hoàng Thanh Sơn cho biết.

Theo ông Cao Tuấn Sĩ, Giám đốc nhà máy lọc dầu Dung Quất, nhiên liệu SAF đã được Vietnam Airlines bay thử 1 chuyến Đà Nẵng ra Hà Nội thành công. Hiện BSR đang phối hợp với các bên, tập trung nghiên cứu để hạ giá thành sản phẩm.

Cùng với triển khai sản phẩm nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững, BSR cũng sẽ xuất bán sản phẩm xăng sinh học E10RON95 vào ngày 1/6/2026 tới đây. Để đảm bảo nguyên liệu cồn sinh học ethanol cho pha chế xăng sinh học E10RON95 theo quy định với nhu cầu dự kiến khoảng 300 nghìn m3/tháng, BSR sẽ tăng cường mua cồn Ethanol từ các nhà máy sản xuất cồn sinh học trong nước, nhất là từ các nhà máy trong hệ thống của Công ty Cổ phần Đồng Xanh, ngoài ra sẽ nhập khẩu nếu thiếu.

Ngoài ra, sản phẩm E10RON95 của BSR sẽ được phối trộn thêm các phụ gia để chống phân tách lớp, đảm bảo chất lượng sản phẩm theo Quy chuẩn Việt Nam (QCVN). Hiện BSR cũng đang phối hợp với các bên để sớm khởi động lại Nhà máy nhiên liệu sinh học Dung Quất, nhằm chủ động một phần nguồn nguyên liệu tại chỗ cồn Ethanol phục vụ pha chế xăng E10RON95.

*Chuyển đổi số để nâng cao sức cạnh tranh Cùng với chuyển đổi xanh, BSR đang đẩy mạnh triển khai chuyển đổi số, lấy trí tuệ nhân tạo (AI) và mô hình nhà máy thông minh làm hạt nhân để nâng cao năng lực cạnh tranh và phát triển bền vững. Theo đại diện BSR, việc tiến tới mô hình nhà máy thông minh tại BSR không chỉ là xu hướng mà còn là nhu cầu cấp bách để thực hiện quản trị biến động, từ đó giúp phản ứng nhanh với sự thay đổi của giá dầu thô, sản phẩm và nhu cầu thị trường. Bên cạnh đó, việc tiến tới nhà máy thông minh còn giúp BSR tối ưu hóa vận hành ở công suất cao, đa dạng hóa các loại dầu thô mới đầu vào và giảm tiêu thụ năng lượng, giảm phát thải. Ngoài ra, việc số hóa này còn giúp giải quyết vấn đề già hóa máy móc và nhân sự bằng cách số hóa tri thức, hỗ trợ ra quyết định nhanh chóng và chính xác cũng như giúp ngăn ngừa các sự cố dừng máy ngoài kế hoạch và đảm bảo tính toàn vẹn thiết bị. Để hiện thực hóa mục tiêu chuyển đổi số, BSR đã thành lập Ban Chỉ đạo Chuyển đổi số, phê duyệt Chiến lược phát triển khoa học công nghệ đến năm 2030 và thành lập phòng Chuyển đổi số chuyên trách. Công ty đã triển khai kết nối dữ liệu giữa hệ thống vận hành (OT) và công nghệ thông tin (IT), tạo ra nguồn dữ liệu duy nhất, chuẩn hóa và bảo mật. Đây chính là ""nhiên liệu"" đầu vào cho các ứng dụng AI. Theo ông Cao Tuấn Sĩ, BSR đã ứng dụng các công cụ như PI Vision và Power BI để theo dõi tổng thể nhà máy lọc dầu Dung Quất, cảnh báo sớm các bất thường và quản trị các công tác bảo dưỡng, chống ăn mòn theo thời gian thực. Nhờ quản trị số, BSR đã duy trì vận hành các phân xưởng ở công suất cao (CDU 118%, RFCC 110%), góp phần tăng doanh thu thêm khoảng 1.540 tỷ đồng. Trong giai đoạn tới, BSR tập trung vào các bài toán AI chuyên sâu để chuyển từ vận hành phản ứng sang quản lý chủ động: Sử dụng AI/ Machine Learning (học máy) để dự báo hỏng hóc cho các thiết bị quan trọng và ăn mòn đỉnh tháp; ứng dụng mô hình Bản sao số (digital Twin) cho các phân xưởng quan trọng nhằm tối ưu hóa vận hành và tiến tới mô hình số hóa toàn diện nhà máy. BSR cũng đặt mục tiêu hình thành trung tâm vận hành số hợp nhất (UDOC) trên cơ sở tích hợp dữ liệu từ sản xuất đến quản trị doanh nghiệp (tài chính, nhân sự, chuỗi cung ứng) trên một nền tảng duy nhất, từ đó giúp lãnh đạo ra quyết định dựa trên phân tích dữ liệu chuyên sâu. Với phương châm ""dữ liệu là nền tảng, AI là công cụ, và quản trị hiệu quả là mục tiêu cuối cùng"", BSR đang từng bước hình thành hệ sinh thái quản trị thông minh, sẵn sàng cho các mục tiêu phát triển bền vững và hội nhập quốc tế, đại diện BSR cho biết. Năm 2025, BSR đã vận hành nhà máy lọc dầu Dung Quất an toàn, ổn định với công suất bình quân quy đổi lên tới 120%. Công ty cũng tận dụng hiệu quả “cửa sổ cơ hội” khi giá dầu thô giảm trong khi giá sản phẩm không giảm tương ứng, thậm chí có thời điểm đi ngược chiều, qua đó tối ưu hóa biên lợi nhuận. Đặc biệt, BSR chủ động điều hành sản xuất và tiêu thụ bám sát các kịch bản sản xuất kinh doanh được xây dựng và cập nhật thường xuyên theo diễn biến giá dầu và crack spread, từ đó linh hoạt điều chỉnh công suất, gia tăng tồn kho chiến lược và đẩy mạnh tiêu thụ khi thị trường thuận lợi. Nhờ vậy, BSR ước đạt sản lượng 7.907.293 tấn, tương đương 108% kế hoạch quản trị; doanh thu đạt 142.800 tỷ đồng; lợi nhuận trước thuế đạt 4.700 tỷ đồng; nộp ngân sách nhà nước 14.300 tỷ đồng. Những con số này tiếp tục khẳng định vai trò then chốt của BSR trong phát triển kinh tế địa phương cũng như đóng góp vào an ninh năng lượng quốc gia. Với kết quả sản xuất kinh doanh vượt trội, năm 2025, BSR được Petrovietnam vinh danh là đơn vị hoàn thành toàn diện kế hoạch quản trị, đồng thời lọt Top 7 thương hiệu lớn nhất thị trường niêm yết theo bình chọn của Forbes Việt Nam. Đây là sự ghi nhận xứng đáng cho chiến lược vận hành hiệu quả, tư duy quản trị linh hoạt và năng lực cạnh tranh ngày càng được nâng cao của doanh nghiệp.

The recognition underlines the depth of regional cooperation at a time when the island nation faced one of its deadliest climate disasters in recent years.

Recognition by Sri Lanka Navy

The Sri Lanka Navy honoured eight foreign naval vessels, including two from India, for providing immediate assistance after Cyclone Ditwah struck in late November. Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya personally conveyed gratitude to diplomatic representatives of the assisting countries. The cyclone triggered widespread flooding, landslides, and infrastructure collapse, overwhelming national disaster-response systems.

Role of Indian Naval Assets

Indian Navy ships INS Vikrant and INS Udayagiri were among the first foreign vessels to respond. Both ships were initially in Sri Lankan waters to participate in the International Fleet Review 2025 marking the navy’s 75th anniversary. Following the cyclone’s landfall on November 27, these vessels were swiftly redeployed for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations.

Operation Sagar Bandhu and Relief Scale

India launched Operation Sagar Bandhu on the very day Cyclone Ditwah made landfall. The mission delivered more than 1,100 tonnes of relief material, including food rations, tents, tarpaulins, clothing, hygiene kits, and water purification equipment. Around 14.5 tonnes of medicines and medical equipment were supplied, along with an additional 60 tonnes of logistical support material. Helicopters deployed from INS Vikrant played a key role in aerial rescue and supply drops.

Beberapa waktu belakangan, penulis kerap bepergian ke berbagai destinasi wisata di Indonesia, sebuah kebiasaan yang menjadi titik balik reflektif mendalam. Sebagai traveler yang sejak kecil menjelajahi dunia, penulis dulu jarang nikmati keindahan negeri sendiri.

Belakangan apresiasi terhadap Indonesia tumbuh pesat. Siapa sangka, wisata lokal menghasilkan emisi karbon lebih rendah, mendukung masyarakat setempat, sekaligus memacu produk domestik bruto (PDB) nasional.

Pengalaman bepergian ini bukan sekadar liburan, melainkan mata air awal penulisan ini dalam membedah paradoks pariwisata kita: wisata bisa jadi pilar ketiga keberlanjutan, ekonomi, sosial, lingkungan, jika dikelola benar.

Wisata meningkatkan PDB, tapi dampak lingkungannya merusak. Destinasi seperti Bali dan Labuan Bajo (Nusa Tenggara Timur) yang diwarnai overtourism mengalami erosi pantai, kerusakan terumbu karang, dan sumber daya alam menipis. Penulis yakin implementasi kebijakan wisata lokal yang tepat bisa memacu ekonomi sekaligus menjaga lingkungan dan meningkatkan kesejahteraan sosial.

Praktik baik sudah ada. Stasiun pengisian ulang botol air minum telah tersedia di Bandara Internasional Soekarno-Hatta Tangerang dan Bandara Internasional I Gusti Ngurah Rai Badung. Hal tersebut mendukung reuse daripada plastik sekali pakai.

Penulis menyarankan agar praktik tersebut diperluas ke stasiun kereta, terminal bus, dan pelabuhan. Selama bepergian dua bulan terakhir, penulis menginap di resor yang mana ada penanaman sayur dan buah sendiri, mengurangi emisi GHG transportasi.

Sheraton Belitung Resort misalnya memperoleh Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) dari PLN pada Mei 2024. Mereka merupakan resor pertama Bangka Belitung di mana sebagian besar energinya berasal dari sumber terbarukan. Mereka menggunakan pasir berpori penyerap air hujan untuk lantai, sebuah langkah yang berkontribusi mengurangi kebutuhan pembersih kimia.

Selain itu, Dialoog Banyuwangi telah menerapkan inisiatif farm-to-table melalui kebun organiknya sendiri, di mana sayur dan rempah segar langsung dipanen untuk restoran. Langkah tersebut mengurangi jejak karbon transportasi makanan dan mendukung pertanian lokal berkelanjutan.

Sayangnya implementasi masih minim. Hanya segelintir resor yang menerapkan langkah tersebut. Stasiun refill belum merata. Pemerintah wajib mendorong resor dan Airbnb memisahkan sampah tamu, beri insentif pajak bagi yang membangun desain bersertifikat berkelanjutan serta transisi ke energi terbarukan.

Pemerintah juga wajib mewajibkan analisis siklus hidup (life-cycle analysis) pada operasional mereka untuk meminimalkan limbah dan emisi. Selain itu, kolaborasi dengan agen travel bagikan ""sustainable travel kit"" seperti reusable cotton pads, gelas tahan lama, kurangi plastik sekali pakai dan sikat gigi disposable.

Luncurkan program ""Refill Cup Favoritmu"" diskon minuman bagi wisatawan yang membawa gelas sendiri di setiap stasiun transportasi umum. Pemerintah juga harus mewajibkan industri hotel dan Airbnb merilis laporan dampak transparan setiap tahun.

Pemerintah jangan melewatkan momentum emas ini! Kebijakan tegas wisata berkelanjutan bukan beban, melainkan investasi cerdas memacu PDB, menciptakan lapangan kerja lokal, dan menjaga warisan alam untuk generasi mendatang.

Penulis memiliki keyakinan penuh kalau Indonesia bisa menjadi destinasi wisata hijau dunia jika bergerak dari sekarang. Pembaca CNBC Indonesia, saatnya mendukung revolusi ini!

A ideia de desenvolvimento com foco na sustentabilidade — economia limpa (de baixo carbono), produção responsável e consumo consciente dos recursos — vem sendo utilizada como promotora de um novo projeto de sociedade, mais eficiente e responsável, capaz de garantir, no presente e no futuro, as mesmas chances de crescimento, porém dentro de novas oportunidades de exploração econômica, sem comprometer a manutenção dos serviços prestados pela natureza. Exatamente o que estamos prestes a vivenciar por aqui.

O Rio Grande do Sul vem experimentando eventos climáticos extremos de toda ordem, desde secas recorrentes até chuvas volumosas, seguidas de granizo e ventos intensos. Um cenário assustador, de prejuízos e perdas incalculáveis, que somente poderá ser revertido a partir de um novo modelo de desenvolvimento econômico, verde e sustentável.

Na Zona Sul, projetam-se iniciativas que devem mudar nossa realidade econômica a partir do próximo ano: investimentos bilionários em logística, energia e indústria, especialmente na indústria naval e em atividades relacionadas à cadeia produtiva do agronegócio. São iniciativas que nos conectam diretamente à corrida global pela descarbonização das atividades econômicas.

A conversão da Refinaria Riograndense, em Rio Grande, na primeira biorrefinaria do país é o melhor exemplo dessa mudança. Trata-se de um investimento de US$ 1 bilhão, com impacto direto na cadeia produtiva de grãos oleaginosos. Um projeto inovador que abre novas oportunidades no campo, seja pela necessidade de adoção de práticas mais sustentáveis de manejo e conservação do solo e da água — impulsionadas pelas exigências de certificação e de acesso ao mercado internacional —, seja pela qualificação da cadeia de insumos, dos serviços, da rede de cerealistas e das esmagadoras de grãos, responsáveis pela produção de óleos estabilizados destinados à fabricação de combustíveis verdes: gasolina, diesel, solventes, gás e o SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel — combustível sustentável de aviação), considerado o mais valioso dos combustíveis e a principal medida de descarbonização do setor aéreo para a redução de emissões e o combate às mudanças climáticas.

Outra grande oportunidade que se avizinha é a geração eólica offshore — energia gerada pelo vento no oceano —, que deverá nos apresentar uma oferta de energia nunca vista, muito além da nossa demanda atual. Esse cenário certamente atrairá novos investimentos para a região: indústrias e novas cadeias de negócios que ainda irão nos descobrir a partir da oferta abundante de energia e da posição logística estratégica, com conexões com o interior do país e com o mundo. Uma perspectiva que, aos poucos, vem sendo confirmada pelos investimentos já anunciados e por outros que devem chegar em breve.

A partir da geração offshore, será possível avançar na produção de hidrogênio verde, incluindo o desenvolvimento da indústria do oxigênio. Com hidrogênio disponível, limpo e em abundância, o céu é o limite: abrem-se oportunidades para a produção de fertilizantes verdes, essenciais na cadeia de insumos de baixo carbono para a produção de combustíveis verdes. E, já que ao final do esmagamento de grãos oleaginosos o que sobra é uma grande quantidade de resíduos (farelo de alto poder proteico e sustentável), estes servem de base para dietas humanas (livres de proteína animal) ou para a produção de ração destinada ao gado confinado.

A pecuária gaúcha, que sempre esteve em destaque no cenário nacional, pode estar próxima de viver uma nova realidade, juntamente com outras fontes de proteína animal, como frango e suínos, ainda pouco desenvolvidas na região: uma vantagem estratégica de reposicionamento no mercado como carne verde, produzida em sistemas de baixa emissão de gases de efeito estufa (GEE), com maior valor agregado e voltada a um público consumidor exigente, especialmente o mercado internacional futuro.

Por outro lado, não será preciso esperar tanto, pois já existe um forte interesse em investir aqui, certamente guiado pela nossa vantagem logística e pelo potencial de geração de energia: o investimento do grupo espanhol Cobra Brasil, de cerca de R$ 6 bilhões, em uma unidade de geração termelétrica, que deverá consumir 5,5 milhões de metros cúbicos de gás natural por dia e gerar 1.200 megawatts de energia. O gás natural, apesar de ser uma fonte fóssil, é menos poluente e essencial como combustível de transição, atuando como ponte para fontes mais limpas e sustentáveis; o investimento de R$ 1,5 bilhão da joint venture entre CMPC Celulose e Neltume Ports para a implantação de um novo terminal portuário. O projeto prevê a construção de dois berços de atracação para navios, dois berços para barcaças e um armazém com capacidade para armazenar 190 mil toneladas de celulose; o investimento de R$ 110 milhões anunciado pela Fontes Verdes, empresa paulista que atua há 15 anos no mercado de hidrogênio e amônia verdes, que avalia o início de suas operações no segundo semestre de 2026; o anúncio do Governo Federal da construção de cinco navios gaseiros no Estaleiro Rio Grande e da passagem seca para São José do Norte…

Um ano que promete ser marcado por boas notícias e novidades, como a produção de etanol de arroz, possivelmente a única alternativa capaz de oferecer a esse tradicional e importante ativo agrícola uma nova rota de utilização, agregando valor, propósito e sustentabilidade à cadeia de negócios.

The facility turns waste fats, including poultry fat, beef tallow and used cooking oil, into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.
Its plants in Louisiana and Texas produce about 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel annually, with production of aviation fuel starting in December 2024.
Backman-Flamerich said current aviation fuel made from waste relies entirely on byproducts from food production, avoiding concerns about growing crops specifically for fuel.
The growing link between poultry production, waste processing and aviation shows how byproducts from one industry can become valuable inputs for another, reducing waste while supporting emission cuts.","United Airlines is turning to waste fats from poultry production as part of its efforts to meet long-term climate goals, with sustainable aviation fuel playing a growing role in its plans to cut emissions, reports WattPoultry.

The airline aims to reduce carbon pollution per passenger seat by 50 per cent by 2035 compared with 2019 levels and to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Sustainable aviation fuel is expected to deliver a significant share of these reductions, accounting for about 17 per cent of the airline’s path to net zero through fuels already in use.

Speaking at the US Roundtable for Sustainable Poultry and Eggs annual meeting, held alongside the 2025 Poultry Tech Summit, United’s senior manager for environmental sustainability, Ryan Backman-Flamerich, said most of the company’s emissions come directly from burning jet fuel. He noted that fuel use from aircraft engines makes up about 98 per cent of the airline’s total emissions.

Aviation currently produces about 3 per cent of global emissions, but that share is expected to rise as other sectors cut pollution more quickly. Backman-Flamerich said that while industries such as power generation are reducing emissions, aviation must move faster or risk becoming a larger part of the global problem even if its own emissions fall.

A key part of United’s strategy involves working with Darling Ingredients, a company that processes animal byproducts and operates Diamond Green Diesel, a joint venture with Valero. The facility turns waste fats, including poultry fat, beef tallow and used cooking oil, into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

Darling Ingredients’ director of sustainability, Ethan Carter, said the company processes nearly 1.5 million tonnes of low-emission raw materials each year for biofuel production. Its plants in Louisiana and Texas produce about 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel annually, with production of aviation fuel starting in December 2024.

Carter said the process ensures that animal byproducts are fully used, helping the poultry and food industries reduce waste while supporting cleaner fuel production. He added that most of the fats collected in North America, including poultry fat, are sent to Diamond Green Diesel for conversion into renewable fuels.

He acknowledged that poultry fat can be more difficult to process due to higher levels of impurities, meaning it cannot be used on its own. However, he said it can still be blended and successfully processed at the facility.

Backman-Flamerich said current aviation fuel made from waste relies entirely on byproducts from food production, avoiding concerns about growing crops specifically for fuel. He added that the industry is still far from reaching the limits of this fuel technology, leaving room for further growth.

Carter said closer links across the supply chain allow companies to expand production and help customers meet their climate targets.

The growing link between poultry production, waste processing and aviation shows how byproducts from one industry can become valuable inputs for another, reducing waste while supporting emission cuts. Backman-Flamerich said progress depends on cooperation across the entire aviation supply chain, including fuel producers and agricultural partners.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-8.png,N,,2026-01-01 05:11:43.044172

The test, conducted on December 30, 2025, clears the enhanced stage for induction into upcoming SSLV flight missions and strengthens India’s launch-on-demand capability.

Successful Static Firing at Sriharikota

According to “Indian Space Research Organisation”, the static ground test of the improved SS3 motor was carried out at the Solid Motor Static Test Facility of the “Satish Dhawan Space Centre”. The motor was fired for 108 seconds, with all performance parameters closely matching pre-test predictions. The SS3 stage is the uppermost solid stage of SSLV and is critical for imparting the required velocity to place satellites into orbit.

Key Design Upgrades and Payload Gain

A major enhancement in the upgraded SS3 motor is the introduction of a carbon-epoxy composite motor case, replacing the earlier configuration. This redesign has significantly reduced the inert mass of the stage, resulting in a payload gain of about 90 kg for the SSLV. The third stage alone delivers velocities of up to 4 km per second. Additional improvements have been made to the igniter and nozzle systems to enhance efficiency, robustness, and overall performance margins while retaining reliability.

Advanced Control and Monitoring Systems

During the test, the SS3 motor was instrumented with around 233 sensors to monitor pressure, thrust, temperature, vibration, and the behaviour of control electronics and actuators. Nozzle control is achieved through a fault-tolerant electro-mechanical actuation system supported by low-power control electronics. Isro stated that these upgrades collectively strengthen operational efficiency and mission assurance for future SSLV launches.

Imporatnt Facts for Exams

Beijing, January 1 - China Aircraft Leasing Group Holdings Limited (CALC), a prominent Hong Kong-based aircraft lessor, has finalized a firm order for 30 Airbus A320neo Family aircraft. Announced in late December 2025, this acquisition addresses robust demand from CALC's global airline customers for efficient single-aisle jets. The deal marks the fifth Airbus order for CALC, elevating its total commitments to the European manufacturer to 282 aircraft, with 203 now from the advanced A320neo series. Deliveries are scheduled in stages through 2033, providing CALC with flexibility to adapt to market needs and further solidify its position as a leading provider of modern Airbus A320neo leasing solutions.

The Airbus A320neo Family continues to dominate the single-aisle market, boasting over 19,000 orders worldwide due to its superior performance and operational economics. Incorporating new engine options and aerodynamic improvements, the A320neo delivers at least 20 percent fuel savings and CO2 reductions compared to previous-generation aircraft. This efficiency makes it an ideal choice for airlines seeking cost-effective fleet modernization amid rising fuel prices and environmental regulations. CALC's latest Airbus A320neo order underscores the type's enduring appeal in the competitive aircraft leasing sector.

Mike Poon, Executive Director and CEO of CALC, highlighted the strategic importance of the partnership with Airbus, noting that it enables the company to offer high-value, innovative aircraft solutions to operators across multiple continents. Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus Executive Vice President of Sales for Commercial Aircraft, praised CALC as a long-standing partner since 2012, emphasizing how the repeat order validates the A320neo's versatility and market demand. As of mid-2025, CALC managed a portfolio serving dozens of airlines in over 20 countries.

This Airbus A320neo acquisition reinforces CALC's commitment to building a future-ready fleet focused on sustainability and efficiency. The A320neo Family is certified for up to 50 percent sustainable aviation fuel blends today, with Airbus targeting full 100 percent SAF compatibility by 2030.

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes, equivalent to 2.4 billion litres, up from around 1 million tonnes in 2024.
Despite the increase, SAF production in 2025 will represent just 0.6 per cent of total jet fuel consumption, rising to 0.8 per cent the following year.
Of that amount, $1.4bn reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional jet fuel.
Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel.","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is expected to have doubled in 2025 but will continue to account for less than one per cent of global jet fuel consumption, according to new estimates released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes, equivalent to 2.4 billion litres, up from around 1 million tonnes in 2024.

However, growth is projected to slow in 2026, with production rising to 2.4m tonnes.

Despite the increase, SAF production in 2025 will represent just 0.6 per cent of total jet fuel consumption, rising to 0.8 per cent the following year.

At current price levels, the SAF premium is expected to translate into an additional $3.6bn in fuel costs for the airline industry in 2025.

IATA said the estimated SAF output for 2025 represents a downward revision from earlier forecasts, citing a lack of policy support to fully utilise installed SAF capacity.

At the same time, SAF prices exceed those of fossil-based jet fuel by around a factor of two, and by up to five times in markets where mandates apply, the association said.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh said that “SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry”.

“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park,” he said, adding that if the objective was to increase SAF production and support aviation decarbonisation, regulators needed to “learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work”.

Against this backdrop, IATA was sharply critical of SAF mandates introduced in the European Union and the United Kingdom, arguing that they have failed to accelerate production while significantly increasing costs for airlines.

In Europe, the ReFuelEU Aviation framework has pushed costs higher amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains.

Fuel suppliers have widened their profit margins to the extent that airlines are paying up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF, IATA said, without guaranteed supply or consistent documentation.

In the UK, the SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the financial burden.

As a result, airlines paid a cumulative premium of $2.9bn for the limited 1.9m tonnes of SAF available in 2025, according to IATA.

Of that amount, $1.4bn reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional jet fuel.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production,” Walsh said, noting that while the European Commission’s recent Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) announcement was a step forward, it lacked a clear timeline.

Turning to the impact on airline climate commitments, IATA warned that the failure to accelerate SAF production capacity would force many carriers to review their targets.

“Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10 per cent SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments,” Walsh said, adding that SAF was “not being produced in sufficient amounts” to enable airlines to achieve those ambitions. He said the commitments had been made in good faith but “simply cannot be delivered”.

Looking ahead, IATA cautioned against repeating the same policy mistakes as mandates for synthetic aviation fuels, or e-SAF, approach in the UK in 2028 and in the EU in 2030.

Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel.

Without strong production incentives rather than mandates, IATA said supply would fall short of targets.

Under the current policy framework, compliance costs could rise to as much as €29bn by 2032 if targets are not met, which the association said was likely.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president for sustainability and chief economist said that “Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect.”

She said regulators must “course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down”, adding that mandates had “done just the opposite” and that it was “outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates”.",https://cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/airplane-air-travel-aviation-aeroplane-flying.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 01:11:53.902841

Clean fuel, net-zero aviation, climate tech – Gevo is trying to sit right in the middle of all of it. The promise: turn crops and waste into low-carbon jet fuel and gasoline that can help airlines and big brands hit their climate goals. The reality: a tiny company, a volatile stock, and a whole lot of risk.

Before you smash that buy button on your trading app, let’s talk receipts: social clout, stock performance, real business moves, and how it stacks up against the competition.

The Hype is Real: Gevo Inc on TikTok and Beyond

On social, Gevo is not Tesla-level famous, but in green energy and penny stock circles, it pops up a lot. You’ll see it on:

Fintok creators breaking down “next-gen aviation fuel plays”

Reddit threads debating whether it’s a “future multi-bagger or zero”

YouTube deep dives on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) stocks

The vibe: high-risk, high-speculation. This is not a safe boomer stock. It’s the kind people either brag about catching early or rant about after a painful dip.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

So is Gevo a game-changer or a potential total flop? Real talk, it’s somewhere in the middle. Here are the three big things you need to understand before you even think about touching this stock.

1. The Big Pitch: Net-Zero Fuel For Jets And Trucks

Gevo’s core flex is this: take things like corn and other feedstocks, run them through its tech, and turn them into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and low-carbon gasoline and diesel. The goal is to make fuel that can drop into existing engines but comes with a much lower carbon footprint.

Why this matters: Airlines, shipping, and logistics giants are under massive pressure to hit climate targets. Governments and regulators are tightening rules, and brands want to brag about climate wins. If Gevo can reliably supply low-carbon fuel at scale and at a competitive cost, it plugs into a huge market.

The catch: Building and running these plants is insanely capital intensive. It’s not an app. It’s hard engineering, big construction, and long timelines. That means delays, cost overruns, and funding risk are always lurking.

2. The Deals: Long-Term Contracts… If They Actually Play Out

One reason people get hyped on Gevo: it has signed multiple offtake agreements (long-term deals) with airlines and big buyers who say they’ll take future volumes of Gevo’s low-carbon fuels.

That sounds bullish, but here’s the twist:

These contracts often depend on Gevo building out enough production capacity.

Timelines can be delayed by permits, funding, tech ramp-up, or market conditions.

Not all announced deals are guaranteed to turn into full cash flow.

Translation: The pipeline looks impressive on slides, but investors are still waiting for meaningful, consistent revenue to catch up with the promises.

3. The Risk Profile: Volatile, Dilutive, And Not For Tourists

Price performance has been a roller coaster. GEVO has had moments of insane spikes when climate policy or airline news hits, followed by brutal pullbacks. Over a longer window, the stock has struggled to hold onto its highest levels and has traded much lower than past peaks.

Because it’s a small-cap clean-tech play, Gevo often needs to raise more money to fund its projects. That can mean share dilution – new shares issued, existing shareholders get diluted, and the price can get pressured. If you hate watching your position swing double digits in a week, this stock will stress you out.

Gevo Inc vs. The Competition

Gevo is not the only one trying to own the sustainable aviation fuel story. Its main clout war is with other companies working on low-carbon fuels and SAF.

Who It’s Up Against

Other SAF and renewable fuel players that already have larger scale or deeper backing.

Big oil and energy companies pivoting into green fuel with serious money and infrastructure.

Alternative climate plays like EVs, batteries, and hydrogen, which compete for investor attention.

In terms of brand clout, some rivals and bigger energy brands win because they’re more established and have more visible commercial-scale plants already operating. But Gevo still gets a lot of niche attention because it’s pure-play, high-upside if it works, and trades like a classic speculative story stock.

So who wins the clout war?

For stability and scale: Larger, more diversified players take the W.

For raw hype and moonshot energy: Gevo still pulls eyeballs in the penny/green growth crowd.

If you want a steadier climate exposure, Gevo is probably not your first pick. If you’re chasing asymmetric upside and can mentally handle the chaos, that’s where Gevo sits.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Let’s answer the only question you actually care about: Is it worth the hype?

Gevo is NOT a safe, passive long-term sleep-well-at-night stock. It’s a speculative climate-tech bet that could pay off big if everything lines up – funding, construction, execution, policy, and customer adoption – or bleed out slowly if those pieces don’t come together.

Here’s the real talk breakdown:

Must-have? Only if you fully understand that this is high-risk and you treat it like a speculative side play, not the core of your portfolio.

Game-changer? The tech and vision absolutely could be game-changing for aviation and low-carbon fuels. The business still has to prove it can scale and generate strong, sustainable cash flow.

Price drop opportunity? Dips can look tempting, but timing this kind of stock is brutal. It can always go lower than you think.

If you’re the type who YOLOs into trending names just because they’re viral, this is a drop until you’ve done serious homework. If you’re a climate-tech nerd willing to hold through chaos and understand that this could go very right or very wrong, then it’s a cautious, highly speculative cop – with small sizing only.

Either way, if you jump in, you’re signing up for a ride. No autopilot here.

The Business Side: GEVO

Here’s the quick company context you need before you start flexing your positions on social:

“Projects like this are crucial to helping to reduce global carbon emissions, while creating jobs and growing our economy,” said Timothy Halman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “And when we welcome projects like this, it continues to position Nova Scotia as a leader in climate change action, innovation and the global clean energy transformation.”

The company will need a second environmental assessment approval for its second phase – a proposed wind energy and solar farm and a transmission line to supply renewable energy for fuel production.

The company expects the project will create about 1,000 jobs during the construction phase, up to 80 jobs during its operation (expected to end in 2081) and direct and indirect economic benefits for local businesses, communities and residents.

The project must comply with 34 stringent terms and conditions in its environmental assessment approval that are designed to protect the environment and human health. The project will also require an industrial approval and a water withdrawal approval.

Quick Facts:

The company would create a new market for Nova Scotia’s oversupply of biomass from forestry activity, including wood chips and bark that are the byproduct of silviculture, harvesting and sawmilling.

The Minister of Environment and Climate Change – the province's environmental regulator – uses the Environment Act and is guided by science and evidence when reviewing environmental assessment requests.

If a project is approved, the regulator typically includes terms and conditions which are designed to ensure the environment and people remain protected throughout the life of the project, while also allowing viable, safe and responsible development to take place.

The Department's inspection, compliance and enforcement staff ensure companies comply with the terms and conditions of their various approvals; in 2024, they conducted about 6,400 inspections to ensure companies were complying with Nova Scotia’s environmental rules and laws.

Hemp growers and retailers in Texas breathed a sigh of relief earlier this year when Governor Greg Abbott vetoed a state ban on hemp-based THC products but those in the industry are again concerned after Congress passed a bill banning all hemp-derived THC currently on the market.

Jonathan Miller, general counsel for the U.S. Hemp Roundtable, said the legislation is already having a negative impact on the industry.

""Farmers who grew hemp that was harvested in October are now having problems selling their products on the marketplace,"" Miller reported. ""Prices had dropped, some places by 40 percent. Given the uncertainty farmers don’t know whether to plant seeds in the ground, this spring – they have to make decisions now.""

The Texas hemp industry contributes more than $5 billion to the state’s economy and has created more than 53,000 jobs.

The national ban is scheduled to go into effect in November of next year but last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order calling for cannabis to be rescheduled as a Schedule III substance. It also calls for regulators to work on legal exceptions for some hemp-based products.

Miller pointed out growers see the executive order as a lifeline but admitted the industry needs more regulations and will work with lawmakers over the next 11 months to make changes.

""So that farmers can make their decision and fully have enough time to develop a regulatory framework to replace the ban,"" Miller explained. ""We’re working with members of Congress to introduce and hopefully pass bills that would crack down (on) the bad actors, would robustly regulate hemp products.""

Miller stressed they support drafting new legislation to replace the total ban with regulations requiring good manufacturing practices, truth in labeling, bans on synthetic THC and strong measures to keep products out of the hands of children.",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-12-31 13:56:32.337395

The project is called Fello’fly and its goal is to optimize routes using the aerodynamic ascent created by an aircraft flying in front. This method will help reducing fuel consumption, cutting emissions and helping airlines save some money.

They believe that air companies could spend less money on combustion if they could copy how migratory birds fly together. Airbus states that they can reduce fuel in long-haul destinations without changing or modifying their existing planes.

They propose to take advantage of the dynamics of airflow, which is similar to the “slipstream” effect—like they do in Formula 1.

Fello’fly: A pairing flights concept

For this concept you need two planes; one will be leading, and while it flies, it leaves a wake behind, that creates a slight support upwards. The second aircraft can then “ride” that flow to improve efficiency, thanks to the energy it recovers from the first plane’s wake.

Airbus has already done a few trials with Air France, Delta Air Lines, French bee, and Virgin Atlantic to validate that the concept works and it’s actually doable in a safe manner, with precision and respecting all regulations.

According to BFM Business, the company executed 8 flights over the North Atlantic between September and October 2025. And these tests demonstrated that it was possible to guide two planes to a precise meeting point (“Rendez-vous”) while keeping the designated distance by the air control.

This could redice up to 5% of fuel requirements in long flights if it is done for commercial flights, according to the air company. Eventually reducing CO₂ too.

What the trials confirm—and what they don’t

When Fello’fly uses the wake the leading plane leaves, this reduces the need to push, and burned fuel. The potential benefit (up to 5% in saving fuel) is still relevant because of rising costs and increasing climate pressure. However, the total impact is more limited than that with all the challenges in structure, like the high cost of cleaner fuels, the shortage of new aircraft and the constant growth of air traffic.

Airbus projects that there will be about 8 billion passengers by 2040—higher than the 4.5 billion in 2019; meaning more flights, and a larger global fleet.

A study by Transport & Environment shows that the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will grow; but, even if the SAF reaches 42% as required by European standards, the sector would burn as much fossil kerosene in 2049 as it did in 2023.

Efficiency in the air—and less fossil fuels

For passengers and airlines, Fello’fly aims for slightly more efficient long-haul flights, with fewer emissions and potential operational savings without changing planes.

And overall, it is a solution that could be implemented in today’s commercial flights without changing much for the customers. It might not fix the whole fuel consumption issue, but it could help to reduce the use of it.

We will still need cleaner fuels, more efficient floats and a better management of traffic growth. But what this air company is doing, it is still very important, because is not about one method, or another; it’s about finding solutions, that together will contribute to a greener and less expensive way to fly.

Airbus’ concept, with the bird-inspired training, the advancement of SAF and technological improvements backed up by big airplane companies, has already shown interesting results. However, the data shows that, even with ambitious SAF quotas, the sector will continue to face a major challenge to reduce the use of fossil kerosene at the rhythm that the industry is asking for it.",https://www.blanquivioletas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Airbus-tests-aircraft.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 14:57:18.485516

The agreement centers on Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel program and relies on its existing global supply infrastructure, integrating the fuel into airport distribution systems where Cathay operates passenger and cargo flights.

Under the agreement, Neste is delivering blended SAF for Cathay Pacific flights at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the European Union and Los Angeles International Airport in the United States. In Asia-Pacific, Neste is supplying SAF at Singapore Changi Airport for Air Hong Kong, the cargo airline owned by the Cathay Group. In each location, the SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel and supplied through standard airport fueling systems.

Cathay Pacific says the agreement supports its broader decarbonization strategy by expanding access to SAF across its network. “Partnering with Neste represents a key step toward our shared vision of decarbonizing air transport,” says Kristof Van Passel, Head of Procurement Operations and Sustainability, Cathay Pacific. “This collaboration is part of our multifaceted strategy to accelerate the adoption of SAF across our global network, strengthening our commitment to innovation and sustainability, and ensuring a tangible impact for our customers and the industry. SAF continues to be the most viable solution currently available to address flight emissions.”

Neste says the agreement reflects its focus on supporting airlines with multinational operations. Mario Mifsud, Vice President of Renewable Fuels Sales and Commercial for EMEA and APAC, Neste, says the company’s production and distribution capabilities enable airlines to increase SAF use across regions. “Our global production and distribution capabilities allow international airlines like Cathay to scale the use of SAF, a key tool for reducing emissions in aviation,” he adds. “At the same time, it enables their customers to reduce the carbon footprint of their travel and logistics operations.”

Neste MY SAF is produced from waste and renewable raw materials, including used cooking oil and residual animal fats. The fuel is certified for commercial aviation use and can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel without requiring modifications to aircraft engines or airport fueling infrastructure.

Neste’s global SAF production capacity stands at 1.5 million metric t per year, says the company. It plans to expand that capacity to 2.2 million metric t annually by 2027. Across all renewable fuel products, Neste expects total production capacity to reach 6.8 million metric t per year by the same year.

For aviation, where near-term electrification is not viable for long-haul routes, SAF is widely viewed as the most practical option to cut lifecycle emissions. Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared with fossil-based jet fuel. The fuel is certified for commercial aviation use. It can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel. This enables immediate deployment across existing airline operations.

Neste MY SAF is compatible with aircraft engines and airport fueling infrastructure, reducing operational disruption for airlines. It allows gradual decarbonization without major capital investment in new fleets or systems. The approach is increasingly relevant as the European Union, North America, and parts of Asia drive stricter emissions requirements.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-12/saf-scaled%20%281%29.jpg?h=e85d0bda&itok=y_SslJIY,N,,2025-12-31 12:56:57.268785

Approximately 80% of Darling's North American fats, including poultry fat, flow to DGD for conversion into renewable fuels.
Carter noted one unique challenge: ""Poultry fat tends to have some higher impurities than we can handle at the facility.
So you could never run 100% poultry fat.
But we are able to run poultry fat in the facility at DGD and we do.""","United Airlines is betting on waste fats from poultry production to help achieve its ambitious climate targets, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) emerging as a critical tool in the carrier's decarbonization strategy.

The airline, one of the world's largest, aims to reduce carbon intensity per passenger seat by 50% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels and reach net zero emissions by 2050. SAF will account for a substantial portion of these reductions — representing 17% of the pathway to net zero through first-generation SAF alone.

""Most of our emissions come from the tail of our aircraft,"" with jet fuel combustion represents 98% of United's emissions footprint, Ryan Backman-Flamerich, United's senior manager of environmental sustainability, told attendees at the U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Poultry and Eggs (US-RSPE) annual meeting, co-located with the 2025 Poultry Tech Summit.

Currently accounting for about 3% of global emissions, aviation's share is expected to grow as other sectors decarbonize more rapidly.

""We know that other sectors are decarbonizing. We know that the power sector is decarbonizing, and that will have effects for other industries,"" he said. ""Even as we work to decarbonize, if we did nothing, our share of that 3% will get larger.""

The rendering connection

Enter Darling Ingredients, which processes 15% of the world's animal byproducts and operates Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), a joint venture with Valero. The facility converts waste fats — including poultry fat, beef tallow and used cooking oil — into SAF using a process called HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids).

Ethan Carter, director of sustainability at Darling Ingredients, emphasized that the company processes nearly 1.5 million metric tons of low-carbon intensity feedstock annually for biofuels. DGD's facilities in Louisiana and Texas produce approximately 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel yearly, with SAF production beginning in December 2024.

""Every part of the animal is getting used,"" Carter said, highlighting rendering's role in the poultry industry's sustainability story. ""We're looking at collecting materials from animal agriculture, from food industries, and really helping with the sustainability there, helping everyone in this room with your sustainability story.""

Approximately 80% of Darling's North American fats, including poultry fat, flow to DGD for conversion into renewable fuels. Carter noted one unique challenge: ""Poultry fat tends to have some higher impurities than we can handle at the facility. So you could never run 100% poultry fat. But we are able to run poultry fat in the facility at DGD and we do.""

Implications for poultry producers

When asked whether any producers were raising poultry specifically for waste products, Backman-Flamerich emphasized that current SAF production relies entirely on byproducts from food production, avoiding food-versus-fuel conflicts.

He added: ""Until we reach some level of maxing out of HEFA, which is in the tens of billions of gallons, I don't think we're going to be there yet.""

“There wasn’t specific discussion about uranium or fracking, or even the fact that (natural resource development) would be the headline push of the second mandate,” Urbaniak said.
Because it is an issue that is polarizing,” Turnbull said, adding that she can’t speculate on when Houston decided he would make a push for natural resource development.
Environmental advocates, meanwhile, have said they worry about the potential environmental and health risks tied to fracking and uranium mining.
When asked about these concerns, Klimek said, “Premier Houston is a Nova Scotian first.","HALIFAX — In the year since the Nova Scotia Progressive Conservatives under Premier Tim Houston won a resounding second mandate, the government’s focus has largely been on a topic that didn’t get much attention during the 2024 election campaign.

Houston’s Tories have lifted a moratorium on fracking and a ban on uranium mining, and opened calls for offshore oil and gas exploration bids. They’ve introduced measures to streamline both the environmental assessments for energy projects and the permitting processes for mining. And the premier laid out plans for a massive offshore wind energy development.

To top it off, in October, Houston named himself energy minister.

Political science experts say that had Houston given voters details about his energy ideas, the November election campaign — after which the Progressive Conservatives won 43 out of 55 seats — may have looked different.

“If there had been more details about critical minerals, what that means for private property potentially, that would have been the dominant discussion in the election campaign,” Tom Urbaniak, a political scientist at Cape Breton University, said in an interview Tuesday.

“There wasn’t specific discussion about uranium or fracking, or even the fact that (natural resource development) would be the headline push of the second mandate,” Urbaniak said.

Instead, the Progressive Conservative campaign focused on lowering some taxes, raising the minimum wage, and hiring more doctors to support the health system. Much of those promises have been fulfilled. The Department of Health says there are 453 more physicians working in Nova Scotia now than in 2021 when the Progressive Conservatives were first elected. The department was not immediately able to provide the number of new doctors hired since the November 2024 election.

To address affordability, the premier pledged to “ensure power-rate fairness” by capping increases to the Canadian average, which has not yet happened. The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a question about progress toward implementing the promised cap.

Lori Turnbull, a political scientist with Dalhousie University, said Tuesday that political parties never do exactly what they include in campaign materials, because unpredictable challenges arise once they enter office.

“But I think the question is, did you intentionally not tell us because you knew it would be controversial, and you didn’t want the campaign to be taken over by something like this? Because it is an issue that is polarizing,” Turnbull said, adding that she can’t speculate on when Houston decided he would make a push for natural resource development.

“If you start talking about the possibility of fracking, possibility of opening up uranium mines, and all of the environmental and health risks that go along with that, that’s the type of thing that, even though it might not be anyone’s Number 1 issue … these other things can become the split issue in the campaign,” she said.

On the campaign trail, the premier did not hold a stand-alone press conference to highlight his natural resources plans, as he did with many election promises. The campaign material said, “the path to future economic prosperity must include a refocusing back to our natural resources.” It made note of critical mineral potential, without specifics, and said efforts will be made to develop sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen.

When asked why natural resource development was not emphasized as a key issue on the campaign trail, a spokesperson for the premier said Houston made it clear to voters he would be focused on growing the economy.

“Then (U.S.) President Trump launched a tariff war against Canada. That made it even clearer we must be more self-sufficient — at a time when a new prime minister is pushing Canada to be an energy superpower and our deficit remains a reality. So we acted,” said Catherine Klimek.

There has been criticism over Houston’s speedy push for mining and natural resource development, with the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs raising concerns in June about government failing to consult with them before the province issued a request for exploration proposals for three sites with known deposits of uranium in. No companies came forward with a bid.

Environmental advocates, meanwhile, have said they worry about the potential environmental and health risks tied to fracking and uranium mining.

When asked about these concerns, Klimek said, “Premier Houston is a Nova Scotian first. He would never put our province at risk. Technology has evolved, and today resource development is governed by rigorous, modern safeguards.”

On Dec. 22, the government said it was putting Dalhousie University in charge of a $30-million program that will see a call for onshore natural-gas exploration in the new year. Officials said new natural-gas development will allow the province to cut back on burning coal for electricity generation and help it hit its 2030 emission targets.

However, a former university president who oversaw the report that led to a decade-long ban on fracking in Nova Scotia has questioned the government’s claims that natural gas would lower emissions and energy prices.

It is either the Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 families. Both have reshaped global aviation profoundly. But today, we are going to talk about the newest Airbus A320neo family. From major hub-to-hub routes to thin regional services, the A320neo has become one of the most recognizable and widely deployed aircraft types in the world. We will explore why the A320neo family has achieved such extraordinary global penetration, examining the technical, operational, and economic forces behind its success.

Since entering service in 2016, the A320neo family has built on the legacy of the original and successful A320 series, which itself revolutionized short- and medium-haul flying. With improved engines, advanced aerodynamics, and cockpit commonality, the A320neo has become a cornerstone of airlines' fleets of every size on every continent of our planet. Understanding why it is everywhere today means looking at how Airbus future-proofed the platform for a rapidly evolving aviation market.

Designing For Scale: How Airbus Built A Global Narrowbody Platform

At the heart of the A320neo family’s global presence is the sheer scale and flexibility of the program. Airbus designed the NEO (New Engine Option) as an evolutionary upgrade rather than a clean-sheet aircraft, allowing airlines to adopt it with minimal disruption. This approach enabled faster certification, quicker airline adoption, a smoother pilot transition, and immediate operational benefits.

The A320neo family includes the A319neo, A320neo, and A321neo, covering a wide range of capacities and mission profiles. According to Airbus, the family delivers at least a 20% reduction in fuel burn and CO₂ emissions compared to previous-generation aircraft, driven mainly by new-generation engines and aerodynamic improvements such as sharklets. These gains translate directly into lower operating costs, a critical factor for airlines operating in competitive short-haul markets. Additionally, the combination of a range up to 4,000 miles and efficiency has made the aircraft attractive not only to full-service carriers but also to low-cost operators and leasing companies worldwide.

But it’s important to mention that the NEO’s success is inseparable from the legacy of the original A320ceo. First introduced in the late 1980s, the A320 was the world’s first commercial jet to feature a full digital fly-by-wire system, setting a new standard for cockpit automation. Over more than three decades, Airbus delivered over 12,000 A320ceo-family aircraft across the A318, A319, A320, and A321 variants, creating one of the largest installed bases in aviation history. This enormous global footprint meant that when the NEO was launched, airlines already trusted the platform, accelerating adoption and reinforcing Airbus’ narrowbody dominance.

Next-Generation Engines & Environmental Performance

One of the most decisive factors behind the A320neo’s global reach is its engine technology. Airbus gave customers a choice between two advanced powerplants: the CFM LEAP-1A and the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM geared turbofan. This dual-engine strategy reduced risk for airlines and broadened the aircraft’s appeal.

Both engines promise double-digit improvements in fuel efficiency, along with lower noise footprints and reduced maintenance costs over the aircraft’s life cycle. The geared turbofan concept, in particular, introduced a new paradigm in narrowbody propulsion by allowing the fan and low-pressure turbine to operate at optimal speeds. These innovations are frequently highlighted by engineers and pilots in operational videos and technical explainers, which often discuss the aircraft’s performance and efficiency.

Beyond fuel burn, the engines support airlines’ environmental commitments. Airbus emphasizes that the A320neo family is already certified to operate with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with a roadmap toward 100% SAF capability by 2030. This future-proofing has reassured airlines planning fleets in an increasingly regulation-driven environment.

Engine choice has always been central to the A320 program’s evolution. Earlier A320ceo variants relied on CFM56 and IAE V2500 engines, both of which proved exceptionally reliable and contributed to the type’s strong dispatch performance. By offering a similar dual-choice with the NEO, this time, either LEAP-1A or PW1100G, Airbus deliberately echoed this strategy, giving airlines continuity while introducing step-change efficiency improvements. This parallel between CEO and NEO generations has helped airlines transition fleets gradually rather than through disruptive wholesale replacement.

Cockpit Commonality & Airline Operational Economics

Another pillar of the A320neo family’s success is cockpit and operational commonality. Airbus deliberately preserved the A320 family flight deck philosophy, ensuring that pilots can transition between variants with minimal additional training. This commonality has powerful implications for airline economics.

Pilots qualified on the A320ceo can move to the NEO with adjustment training rather than full type certification, significantly reducing training costs. Maintenance crews benefit from similar efficiencies, as many systems and procedures remain unchanged. This continuity has been repeatedly emphasized in industry discussions and pilot-focused video content, analyzing why airlines favor Airbus narrowbodies.

For large operators running hundreds of aircraft, these savings scale rapidly. Fleet flexibility also improves resilience, allowing airlines to swap aircraft between routes and bases without complex retraining programs. This operational simplicity has been a key driver of the A320neo’s rapid adoption across continents.

This philosophy dates back to the earliest days of the A320ceo family. Airbus designed the A319, A320, and the stretched A321 to share a common type rating, allowing airlines to tailor capacity without fragmenting pilot pools. The NEO family preserves this approach, meaning a pilot can fly an A319neo on a short regional sector one day and an A321neo on a high-density or long-range route the next. Furthermore, this commonality goes beyond the A320 family. According to Airbus, pilots with an A320 type rating can transition to larger cousins such as the A330 and A350, in as little as one week to ten days of additional training! This seamless scalability remains one of the A320 family’s most underappreciated competitive advantages.

Production Scale, Availability, & Worldwide Visibility

While efficiency and commonality matter, availability and production scale are equally crucial to global presence. Airbus has invested heavily in expanding A320neo production capacity to meet unprecedented demand. This industrial strategy has helped cement the aircraft’s dominance.

The A320neo family is assembled in multiple final assembly lines across Europe, Asia, and North America. This geographically distributed production model reduces delivery risk and brings Airbus closer to key customers. According to industry tracking and Flightradar24's analysis, the A320neo is now one of the most frequently observed aircraft types in global airspace, reflecting both high delivery volumes and intense daily utilization.

Airbus’ massive order backlog further reinforces the type’s visibility. Thousands of A320neo-family aircraft are on order with airlines and lessors, ensuring that the type will remain a dominant feature of global fleets well into the 2030s.

But this impressive production scale did not emerge overnight. The A320ceo program steadily ramped up output through the 1990s and 2000s as demand surged from Europe and North America, and later from Asia-Pacific. By the time the NEO entered service, Airbus already had decades of narrowbody manufacturing experience and a mature global supply chain. This continuity allowed the manufacturer to transition from CEO to NEO production without the severe bottlenecks often associated with all-new aircraft programs.

Why The A321neo Became The Family’s Standout Variant

A common question is why the A321neo, in particular, has become so prominent within the family. The answer lies in its ability to blur the line between traditional narrowbodies and widebodies. For many airlines, the long-range XLR variant has replaced larger aircraft on certain routes.

Airbus has extended the narrowbody concept to the long-haul market with variants such as the A321LR and A321XLR. These aircraft can operate transatlantic and other long-range routes with lower trip costs than widebodies, opening new city pairs. Airlines and analysts frequently cite this capability as a strategic game-changer, a topic often discussed on social media and in technical forums.

This flexibility has driven strong demand from both legacy carriers and low-cost airlines seeking growth without the financial risk of widebody fleets. As a result, the A321neo has become one of the fastest-selling aircraft in Airbus’ history, further expanding the family’s global presence.

The A321 itself has an important lineage within the family. Introduced as a higher-capacity derivative of the original A320, it allowed Airbus to challenge larger narrowbodies and even some short-haul widebodies. The NEO generation has further elevated this concept, while the A319 and A320 continue to serve as right-sized solutions for lower-demand markets. Together, these subvariants allow airlines to fine-tune capacity while maintaining fleet commonality. This is an approach few competitors have matched at a similar scale.

The A320neo Family’s Long-Term Role In Global Aviation

Looking ahead, the A320neo family’s global presence is likely to grow even further as airlines focus on sustainability, efficiency, and network flexibility. Airbus continues to refine the platform with incremental upgrades and digital enhancements. These improvements ensure the aircraft remains competitive against both current and future rivals.

For airlines, the A320neo represents a low-risk, high-reward investment that aligns with modern operational and environmental priorities. For passengers, it offers quieter cabins, improved comfort, and access to more direct routes. These combined benefits help explain why the aircraft is now virtually everywhere.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/global-3.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-31 12:12:17.479940

China's National Energy Administration recently released its five-year plan, which included ways for provinces to use excess renewable energy. During peak production, renewable sources like wind and solar can sometimes produce more electricity than the grid can handle.

Outputs like green hydrogen generation can put that excess power to good use. The National Energy Administration's plan also pointed to green ammonia, green methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel as other uses for surplus renewable energy. Like green hydrogen, they can also be used to cut transportation pollution.

China has already started building production facilities that tightly link renewable energy with hydrogen. Meanwhile, Chinese researchers have been able to tap into water vapor as a green hydrogen source.

Burning coal, oil, and gas are the biggest sources of atmospheric pollution, but hydrogen's sustainability depends entirely on how it's made. Hydrogen needs energy to be separated from water. If that energy comes from fossil fuel sources, the resulting hydrogen embodies that pollution, even if using hydrogen doesn't directly produce harmful by-products.

China is the world's largest polluter, thanks in no small part to its reliance on coal power. However, it has also deployed the most solar energy in the world. It's no slouch when it comes to wind power, either. The more it can reliably transition to green energy sources, the sooner it can replace dirty power like coal.

Grid-scale energy emissions are contributing to atmospheric pollution, which exacerbates destructive weather patterns and affects China directly. The country has weathered increasingly severe floods, droughts, and storms like many others, and borne the costs that go with them.

The company says it now operates more than 150 heavy-duty Class 8 electric vehicles across the continent, plans to add more semis in 2026 as Tesla begins its volume production.

Stephan Schablinski, vice president of GoGreen North America at DHL Supply Chain, told Transport Topics that more deliveries are expected to begin from next year’s second half onward. Schablinski said DHL wants to operate the Semi tractors in other states beyond California, including Ohio and Pennsylvania.

According to the company, 30 percent of DHL’s medium- and heavy-duty trucking fleet is expected to be battery-electric or powered by another zero-emissions technology by 2030.

The Tesla Semi pilot took place in Livermore, Calif. over two weeks in October 2026, where the all-electric truck covered over 3,000 miles of regular routes. The trial included one long haul of 390 miles, and was fully loaded with a gross combined weight of 75,000 pounds.

“Our pilot of the Tesla Semi exceeded expectations, proving its ability to efficiently haul a typical DHL freight over long distances on a single charge,” said Jim Monkmeyer, president of transportation, DHL Supply Chain North America, in a statement. “Integrating the Tesla Semi into our fleet is an important step toward achieving our decarbonization goals and delivering more sustainable solutions for our customers.”

According to Tesla, the Semi can travel up to 500 miles on a single charge, and can recover up to 70 percent of range in 30 minutes. Class 8 trucks typically have a range of less than 250 miles on one charge.

Dan Priestley, director of Semi at Tesla, said the DHL partnership will “help us make the product even better for future global markets.” Tesla says the start of serial production of the Semi remains on schedule for late 2025 with a ramp up to capacity in 2026.

The truck currently travels approximately 100 miles per day in central California, DHL says, and requires charging about once per week. Additionally, it is projected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 metric tons annually.

With the Tesla Semi within its fleet, DHL can further accelerate its transition to net zero-emission logistics, a call the logistics giant aims to reach by 2050. On a shorter-term basis, the company is also pushing to reduce absolute carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from 40 million metric tons to 29 million in 2030 to stay aligned with Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) requirements.

Tesla is one of multiple companies that DHL has worked with for electric trucking adoption since 2020, with the company teaming up with BYD, Volvo Trucks, Daimler Truck, Scania and now-defunct Nikola on separate deployments. DHL Supply Chain also owns and operates more than 50 Orange EV yard trucks that are deployed at 30 sites across the country to move trailers and shipping containers.

The Livermore facility does not have any other battery-electric trucks other than the Tesla Semi, according to Schablinski.

Beyond the long haul, EVs have been a priority for DHL’s wider last-mile delivery ambitions.

As of October, DHL said it has 39,000 total EVs worldwide in pickup and delivery services, representing more than 41 percent of pickup and delivery vehicles. The company aims to increase this share to 66 percent in 2030.

Decarbonization at the logistics giant also extends to its air cargo operation, which accounts for 68 percent of DHL’s emissions. DHL has already used 188,000 metric tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) between 2020 and 2024 and will double that figure this year. SAF now makes up 3.5 percent of the company’s total jet fuel mix, with the firm aiming to escalate this number to 30 percent by 2030.

DHL’s sustainability push recently pushed into ocean freight. This month, DHL partnered with ocean carrier CMA CGM to decarbonize container shipping, with the logistics companies committing to use 8,900 metric tons of a lower-carbon biofuel for ocean shipments.

Under that initiative, DHL and CMA CGM expect to slash roughly 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for ocean freight shipped through DHL’s GoGreen Plus and CMA CGM’s ACT+ programs.

Those programs are designed to let customers pay a premium price to select more sustainable fuel options for their shipments.

Introduction

Climate change has become one of the largest threats currently facing humanity. As such, much time and effort has been devoted to discovering novel ways to decarbonize our modern society, including aviation . We increasingly rely on aviation to connect with the world, and thus finding a solution to make aviation more sustainable is necessary to meet global climate goals . Fortunately, many strides have already been made in terms of decreasing the energy intensity per passenger-mile of air travel through various improvements in technology, leading to the energy intensity of air travel decreasing by 77% per passenger in two decades. This great improvement cannot fully account for the increasing demand for air travel that we have especially seen in the past decade, as overall emissions from air travel still increased by 30% from 2013 to 2019 alone . This indicates a troubling trend in the commercial aviation industry. While commercial air travel only accounted for 2.5% of global emissions in 2022, this is expected to rise to 11% in the next two decades if significant advances in technology are not made to account for rising demand . It is important to understand that “emissions” encompasses not only the classic CO2, but also other carbon emissions like CO, and nitrous oxides (NOx). NOx emissions can decrease crop yields, cause diseases in humans, and exacerbate the Greenhouse Gas effect by creating ozone, thus perpetuating climate change‘ . Thus, to prevent the environmental and economic disadvantages of rising emissions, it is clear that we must invest more into the discovery and development of novel sustainable aviation technologies.

To support this goal, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which is a trade association representing a large portion of air travel, has set a goal for aviation emissions to reach 50% of their 2005 level by 2050 . To achieve this, large investments into every sector of aviation will be required, but one of the most crucial is the fuel being used. While many alternatives such as Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) and hydrogen (H2) have been considered and extensively studied, some recent research has begun to focus on ammonia (NH3) as a possible fuel option due to its possible fuel option due to its potentially low carbon emissions . While SAFs and hydrogen have received substantial attention, ammonia is increasingly discussed due to its potential for carbon-free combustion and simpler airplane storage needs than hydrogen due to its higher freezing temperature and narrower flammability range‘ . Furthermore, recent increased interest in ammonia may be explained by its production on an industrial scale for over a century as a fertilizer and refrigerant, making it easily accessible . It also is roughly 17.8% of hydrogen by mass, meaning that many of hydrogen’s benefits could be accessed by utilizing the more convenient-to-store and -produce ammonia instead .

This paper is a systematic review synthesizing data from papers published from 2017 to 2025 to provide a comparative analysis of alternative aviation fuels and evaluate ammonia’s technical viability. The primary limitation of this paper is that no experimental research facilities were accessible, so all findings are based on the experimental work of other researchers. The focus of this article is to review some processes related to fuel combustion (if applicable) and emissions (both carbon dioxide and NOx) with a specific focus on the alternative aviation fuels described previously (SAFs, hydrogen, and all-electric battery). No other paper reviewed by the authors included both an analysis of ammonia as well as analyses of SAFs, hydrogen, and all-electric battery systems, making this paper unique in its method of evaluating the effectiveness of ammonia. The intent of this analysis is to inform policymakers and researchers as to what some of the most promising lines of inquiry are in the field of sustainable aviation. We do not attempt to comprehensively review the entire field of alternative aviation fuel, as this is a continuously evolving area of research. The first section of this paper serves as an overview of ammonia and sustainable aviation goals. The next section outlines the methodology used in the creation of this paper, followed by an extensive comparison of all four considered fuels (SAFs, hydrogen, all-electric battery, and ammonia) concluding with an evaluation of current research prospects in the fourth section. Finally, the fifth section presents the conclusions of the paper along with research recommendations.

Methodology

For this research paper, a systematic literature review was conducted to gain a holistic view of the most current work being done in the field of sustainable jet fuels, with the data collection period beginning in June 2025 and ending in September 2025. The general methodology followed is displayed in Figure 1. Search engines like Google Scholar and JSTOR were used to find papers, first using keywords like “sustainable aviation fuels”, “hydrogen as jet fuel”, and“alternative jet fuels” to build a comprehensive view of existing literature in the field. Google Scholar was generally preferred over JSTOR due to having more primary sources related to aviation than JSTOR when the same keywords were used. Then, keywords such as “ammonia as jet fuel” and “ammonia combustion properties” were used to gain a thorough understanding of the ammonia niche. Paper relevancy was assessed first by publishing date, as all papers older than 2023 were prioritized due to being the most up to date information, but some older sources were used when no more recent papers were available or when appropriate for the subject. Then, papers were thoroughly reviewed to ensure their findings were relevant to the topic of this paper by scanning the titles of papers, looking for connections to aviation. Source credibility was assessed by verifying publication integrity, with peer-reviewed academic journals, conference papers, and credible books being preferred above all else whenever possible. Finally, research design of the paper was considered, as experimental research was prioritized, but non-experimental papers were not always excluded. Numerical findings from research papers were extracted through thorough analysis of the papers and digital note-taking, making special note of papers that contained experimental findings about combustion properties.

Ultimately, 29 sources were determined to meet these requirements, most of which were research papers published in academic journals. All sources were evaluated to ensure no duplicates appeared. Any sources not coming from academic journals were instead from other reputable sources, such as government websites, and were largely not used for critical information. Main takeaways were synthesized and numerical findings were compared from differing sources to provide a basis for this paper’s discussion.

Results

Background

In order to fully understand ammonia as an alternative fuel, it is first important to understand other alternative fuel solutions that have been proposed. The aim of this section is to provide an overview of three of the main areas of research other than ammonia (Sustainable Aviation Fuels, hydrogen, and electric) and evaluate their advantages and disadvantages in relation to the metrics previously described (emissions, ease of integration, and technological limitations). Since this paper deals with the field of combustion, the following key properties are considered to compare combustion properties: 1) Flame speed, or the speed at which a flame propagates through a fluid. 2) Ignition Delay Time (IDT), or the time interval between the start of fuel injection and combustion. Both of these properties heavily influence engine design, particularly the fuel injection systems and combustor geometry. However, an important distinction between them is that while IDT decreases with temperature, flame speed increases‘ . The typical parameter ranges within which aircraft engines operate is described in Table 1 below. While these conditions may not be the exact same as those later reported in the paper, later reported work still reflects the general trends for combustion of the discussed fuels (if relevant) .

Table 1 | Typical Aircraft Engine Parameter Ranges

Sustainable Aviation Fuels

Sustainable Aviation Fuels encompass a wide range of fuels that are united by their production methods: they are typically made using waste products or other biological products such as leftover cooking oil or animal fats‘ . This pivot away from using petroleum-based fuels leaves ample room for life-cycle carbon emission savings despite similar combustion to conventional jet fuel, with some finding an up to 90% reduction in overall emissions . However, some other cradle to grave analyses, which includes all emissions involved in the transportation, production, and combustion of SAFs, have found emission reductions as low as 27% . Nonetheless, some non-trivial emission reduction is essentially guaranteed for aircraft operating on SAFs. It is also crucial to note that SAFs are entirely drop-in compatible, since they are chemically engineered to have similar combustion properties (including flame speed and IDT) to conventional jet fuels . Since SAFs have such similar combustion properties to conventional jet fuels, while their specific chemical compositions may vary, they will generally follow the general combustion equation of a hydrocarbon (shown above) . However, this does again emphasize that this approach is not free from carbon emissions. This is a substantial advantage, as it means that essentially no engine redesigns are required to begin utilizing SAFs, minimizing downtime of aircraft and costs associated with creating new engines. Thus, SAFs work remarkably well within our current technological limitations.

However, the primary roadblock to widespread SAF adoption currently is high price, as SAFs can cost between 120-700% more than conventional jet fuels .This would make a transition to utilizing SAFs incredibly taxing on commercial airlines financially, and the effect is only worsened by the lack of producer incentives currently in place . Currently, SAF production is operating at only 3.5% of its total potential capacity, largely due to policies around the world not incentivizing growth within the market . Thus, although SAFs offer substantial savings on emissions and work within our technological limitations, the financial cost of integrating them today is simply too high for airlines to cover, and substantial policy reform is needed to encourage growth to meet potentially rising demand.

Hydrogen

Hydrogen is widely renowned for having nearly zero carbon emissions in combustion, as its combustion equation only directly produces water (although some NOx emissions may result as an indirect byproduct of combustion) . It is also roughly 3x as gravimetrically energy dense as conventional jet fuel, meaning that every 1 kg of hydrogen has 3x the energy as 1 kg of jet fuel . Although direct life-cycle evaluations of hydrogen as a jet fuel are lacking, an analysis on the potential saving of hydrogen in automobiles found a potential 15-45% decrease in lifetime emissions .This is not a direct parallel to emission savings that could be seen if implemented in aviation, as automobiles and aircraft operate under very different conditions, but it nonetheless indicates a relatively substantial decrease in emissions that would likely apply to aviation as well.

The fact that hydrogen does not guarantee a 100% decrease in emissions is in large part due to its production process. Although hydrogen can be produced sustainably through water electrolysis, a process in which electricity is used to split water into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), only 0.1% of hydrogen is currently produced in this manner due to prohibitively high costs, and it relies on availability of green energy on the grid to be fully carbon neutral . Carbon capture technology, which substantially reduces the emissions of production processes, are only being used in 0.6% of hydrogen production . The other 99.3% of hydrogen being produced utilizes either oil or natural gases to fuel methane (CH4) reforming, which also releases methane as a waste product with up to 120x the heating power of CO2‘ . This has led to the production of hydrogen being responsible for roughly 2% of current annual CO2 emissions .

Furthermore, hydrogen poses many challenges in terms of storage and usage on aircraft, since it is only 25% as volumetrically energy dense as conventional jet fuel and requires incredibly cold, high pressure storage tanks . This means that space would have to be made on the aircraft for tanks that are much larger and require much more pressurization and cooling than the tanks currently in use, necessitating a fundamental redesign of the aircraft. Unfortunately, this redesign will also have to reach the engines, as hydrogen has nearly eight times the flame speed of and much lower IDT than conventional jet fuel, meaning that it is not drop-in compatible‘ . Much research has been dedicated to solving for these differences, though, and there are some prototype designs that could theoretically utilize hydrogen .

In sum, in terms of emissions, unsustainable hydrogen production makes hydrogen undesirable. In terms of ease of integration, more work is needed in terms of redesigning all aircraft fundamentally and getting hydrogen to every airport, making hydrogen undesirable. Finally, in terms of technological limitations, the challenges posed by hydrogen storage currently make widespread usage unlikely.

All-Electric

The field of electrically propelled aircraft encompasses not only aircraft relying entirely on electricity for propulsion (all-electric), but also hybrid aircraft that rely both on conventional jet fuel and batteries . This section primarily focuses on all-electric aircraft, since these present the most exciting change in comparison to today’s aircraft. Such an aircraft would have very minimal if any emissions when implemented in the aircraft, with the only life-cycle emissions coming from battery production-related emissions. These emissions are still relatively low, though, as one analysis found that business carriers could see a 93% reduction in emissions if they were made all-electric . This is the most dramatic emission reduction discussed thus far, but unfortunately, all-electric aircraft fall short in other ways.

All-electric aircraft would rely on batteries storing huge amounts of energy to maintain power during the flight, but current battery technology is simply not advanced enough to accommodate this. Even the most efficient batteries today would have to be prohibitively large and heavy in order to store enough energy for a single flight, with weight increasing with the length of the flight . This would cause all-electric aircraft to have slower flight times and shorter ranges than today’s aircraft, hugely hampering their potential to be a full solution as not all routes could be served‘‘ . One analysis found that even in an optimistic case where it would be possible to produce all-electric aircraft capable of traveling up to 500 km per flight, this would only affect 5% of all commercial aircraft energy usage . Thus, 95% of the energy used by commercial aviation would still be contributing to climate change, and the previously stated emission reductions are severely hampered in scale. Furthermore, the colossal size of batteries needed to support commercial aviation would also cause 92% of commercially used aircraft to be unable to take off due to excessive battery weight . All-electric propulsion is also entirely not drop-in compatible, as it would require a fundamental redesign of the aircraft to accommodate the new batteries . This means that no currently used aircraft could continue to be used without substantial modification, incurring extra downtime of aircraft and costs related to heavily modifying and redesigning aircraft.

In all, while having the potential for incredible emission reductions, all-electric propulsion fundamentally fails to make a significant impact due to its cumbersome implementation and need for technology that simply does not exist yet. Until serious advances in battery efficiency are achieved, further research in other fields or in hybrid-electric models is recommended.

Ammonia

The balanced equation for the combustion of ammonia and air (shown above) shares many features with that of hydrogen and air, including a lack of carbon outputs. However, it notably includes some N2 as an output, which sets it apart from hydrogen and introduces new considerations for combustion and emissions which will be further discussed in this section. While still requiring more complex storage than conventional fuel, one of the primary advantages of ammonia is that it has much less stringent storage requirements than hydrogen. Ammonia has a boiling temperature of -33 ℃ at 1 atm, compared to hydrogen’s -253 ℃, meaning that it would require less investment into cryogenic tanks . This makes ammonia a seemingly ideal substitute, as it significantly mitigates one of the primary design challenges associated with use of hydrogen. It is still somewhat more complex to store than conventional jet fuels, though, which are liquid at room temperature and typically have freezing temperatures around -50 ℃, with some fluctuation depending on exact fuel composition .Thus, much recent research in the field of sustainable aviation has focused on the utilization of ammonia as a jet fuel through several different methods. This section discusses and evaluates the use of ammonia as jet fuel (pure ammonia use), using ammonia as a hydrogen carrier (typically through cracking or complex combustion), and the use of ammonia as an additive to other fuel types.

Pure Ammonia Use

Using ammonia on its own may seem like the most simple solution, as it would ideally serve as a direct replacement for jet fuel while circumventing the challenges associated with hydrogen. Unfortunately, ammonia causes many new issues to arise that hydrogen does not suffer from. While hydrogen has a relatively high flame speed and low IDT, ammonia has the opposite problem of having a low flame speed and high IDT‘‘‘ . Table 2 displays the flame speed of several mixtures, notably showing that by replacing just half of a hydrogen mixture with ammonia, the flame speed is decreased almost sevenfold . The flame speed for an ammonia/air mixture, though, was not determined at these exact conditions by any work reviewed for this paper. However, at P = 5 bar, T = 500 K, and Φ = 1, the flame speed of ammonia-air has been experimentally determined to be roughly 0.11 m/s, far below any other flame speed presented despite being at a higher pressure . Clees et al. attempted to validate some of the foremost models for predicting IDT through shock tube experiments and OH* and OH measurements, as the presence of these indicate ignition in the fuel, finding that most models are unable to accurately predict the IDT of ammonia at all temperatures .

Table 2 | Comparison of Flame Speeds at P = 2 bar, T = 600 K, and Φ = 1 .

This essentially means that while hydrogen presents challenges due to being too readily combustible, ammonia is instead too difficult to combust. The primary consequence of this is that pure ammonia mixtures would be incompatible with current aviation engines, as the combustor geometry is simply not suited for efficiently combusting fuels with these properties due to combustion possibly occurring too late . Furthermore, analyses have even found potential for ammonia in current engines not fully combusting before leaving the engine due to these differences in combustion properties, thereby releasing more unburnt ammonia, NOx, and other harmful emissions into the environment . Therefore, due to the massive engine redesign that would be required and potential for harmful emissions, using pure ammonia on its own as a fuel is not recommended.

Alternative Ammonia Combustion

The potential of ammonia due to its previously discussed advantages over hydrogen has spurred further research into novel uses of ammonia. Specifically, some research groups have examined the possibility of using ammonia as a hydrogen carrier in order to avoid the downsides of ammonia while still enjoying its benefits. One such approach is called ammonia cracking, which involves the splitting of ammonia into nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen prior to reaching the combustor‘ . This approach has the added benefit of utilizing waste heat from the engine to fuel the cracking process, thereby increasing overall system efficiency . Furthermore, due to the increased presence of stable nitrogen and hydrogen, which are much less likely to form NOx emissions than ammonia on its own, NOx emissions have been predicted to decrease in planes using this approach . Implementation of this design would require the addition of a cracking chamber to each engine, as well as redesigns to accommodate the combustion of hydrogen, but hypothetical models have been made that fit these requirements . The largest barriers this approach faces are the inherent inconvenience of having to entirely redesign all existing engines, the added weight of cracking systems, and the novelty of this idea, as it has never been implemented on a commercial scale before. Thus, significant investment into experimental research is recommended before implementation of this approach.

A second approach being considered is the splitting of ammonia into hydrogen and nitrogen through two-stage combustion. This means that there will first be a fuel rich zone, with high concentration of ammonia to begin conversion to hydrogen, followed by a fuel lean zone, with a high concentration of air to complete conversion, as seen in Figure 2 .

Again, a main advantage of this approach is a significant decrease in NOx emissions at aircraft engine conditions due to increased N2 presence . However, most previous examples of two-stage ammonia emissions incorporate the use of a pilot or start-up fuel to compensate for ammonia’s unfavorable combustion properties, such as methane‘ . This once again reintroduces carbon into the combustor, although generally additions of CH4 have been shown to reduce emissions on net because of increased combustion efficiency . While this approach would not require the addition of a whole new cracking chamber, it would still require significant combustor redesign and fuel mixing techniques that have yet to be achieved on a practical level in the aviation industry. Furthermore, recently published studies have found that while novel combustion techniques like multi-stage combustion do generally lead to reductions in NOx emissions, the most effective approach to mitigating NOx emissions is to have the equivalence ratio be greater than 1, which has not yet been tested for either cracking or multistage combustion . Thus, this approach is not yet feasible due to a lack of experimental research.

Ammonia as an Additive

While both of the previous techniques are limited by their reliance on unproven engine redesigns, the most promising line of ammonia research in terms of near-term feasibility currently ongoing relies on assuming none of these major changes. Specifically, Alabaş suggests using ammonia as an additive, either to hydrogen, kerosene, or both . The central study pushing forward this alternative was conducted using over 1600 iterations in ANSYS Fluent using the SIMPLE algorithm . Specific model parameters can be seen in Table 3 below. Authors modeled a GTM-120 mini gas turbine engine, which is a typical research tool for studying the behavior of airplane engines . Thus, all results are assuming no or minimal changes to current engine designs.

Table 3 | Model Parameters Used to Evaluate Ammonia as an Additive

Several mixtures were tested with concentrations of ammonia ranging from 5% to 45%, kerosene limited to 50%, and hydrogen making up the difference . It is important to note that while the addition of kerosene generally improved combustion efficiency, it had the significant tradeoff of introducing carbon to the mixture, thus producing carbon emissions . In terms of ammonia, the study found that while NOx emissions peaked at 5% ammonia, they then decreased rather significantly after that point as the concentration of ammonia increased, likely due to decreased flame temperatures . Ultimately, the ideal mixture the study recommends is 50% kerosene, 45% ammonia, and 5% hydrogen because of its lowered NOx emissions and overall burn efficiency . This increase in burn efficiency is reflected in a decrease in CO emissions, which result as a byproduct of incomplete combustion, and the massive difference in this can be seen in Table 4 .

Table 4 | Ammonia Mixture Emissions Comparison .

While this is not an ideal solution due to the inclusion of kerosene, a hydrocarbon, this still provides greatly lowered emissions compared to conventional jet fuel while still preserving drop-in compatibility . Thus, because of the significant technological and logistical barriers that come with implementing all other proposed solutions, using ammonia as an additive is likely the most technologically feasible solution at this time. While notable emissions reductions are still achieved, the largest barrier to decarbonizing aviation is circumvented: difficulties within implementation. However, this study did not take into consideration the storage of the fuel mixture, which is a substantial oversight since (as previously discussed) storing both ammonia and hydrogen comes with unique challenges that could potentially complicate implementation. There is no explanation of how the blend will be kept at a temperature and/or pressure suitable for all involved fuels, which is alarming due to the vastly different storage requirements they have (see section Ammonia). There is also a notable lack of experimental confirmation of the simulation’s findings. Thus, while this approach is by far the most promising discussed thus far, experimental research is strongly recommended to further validate the authors’ claims.

Discussion

As the commercial aviation industry continues to grow across the world, the need to create low-carbon propulsion becomes increasingly apparent. While solutions such as all-electric, hydrogen, pure SAFs, or even pure ammonia may not yet be feasible primarily due to technological limitations, ammonia can still serve as a valuable stepping stone. See Table 5 for an overview of the conclusions drawn regarding all considered power sources. The use of ammonia as an additive to other fuels is an incredibly exciting idea, and while it may not be an entirely carbon-free solution, it will still decrease emissions if implemented. It also benefits from requiring minimal if any engine redesigns, as previously described, making it more simple to implement. This can be used as a transition period from our current lack of adequate solutions for carbon-free fuels like hydrogen. Thus, more research is strongly recommended within this area to experimentally validate the findings of the study discussed and to continue pushing for more sustainable aviation.

Table 5 | Metric Evaluation by Power Source

Experimentalist researchers ought to use the models previously described to guide their experiments in order to validate the findings these previous researchers have presented, directly furthering the line of inquiry into the use of ammonia as an additive. One recommended approach is testing different combinations of kerosene, hydrogen, and ammonia at conditions similar to an airplane engine, as previously described. Both the aviation industry and policymakers are strongly recommended to support the exploration and development of this technology through financial investments and policy support. It is also important to consider that all conclusions drawn and recommendations made in this paper are based on a literature review which, while as thorough as possible, does not preclude the existence of contradicting studies or information. The findings discussed above should be interpreted as a preliminary step toward creating a more sustainable future for aviation, whether or not ammonia is involved.

What began as cautious optimism has evolved into renewed confidence, record demand and long-term strategic investment. Airlines have rebuilt networks, manufacturers have increased output, and sustainability has moved from aspiration to action.

Below is a month-by-month look back at the 12 defining moments that shaped UK aviation and aerospace over the last year.

January – A Confident Start as Passenger Demand Holds Firm

The year opened with UK aviation in a far stronger position than many had anticipated. Passenger volumes through major hubs such as Heathrow Airport remained robust despite the traditional winter slowdown. Long-haul routes, particularly to North America and the Middle East, continued to perform strongly, while leisure demand across Europe showed little sign of weakening.

Airlines entered the year balancing strong bookings against rising costs, but January clearly signalled that passenger confidence had firmly returned.

February – Sustainable Aviation Fuel Moves Up the Agenda

February saw Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) gain further prominence as airlines, airports and manufacturers reiterated its importance in cutting aviation emissions this decade. Industry leaders emphasised that SAF represents the most practical near-term solution for decarbonising flight while new aircraft and propulsion technologies mature.

The focus also turned to the need for domestic SAF production, with calls for policy certainty to unlock investment and prevent reliance on imported fuel.

March – Fleet Modernisation Accelerates

As spring approached, UK airlines stepped up fleet renewal programmes. New-generation aircraft entered service offering improved fuel efficiency, lower noise footprints and enhanced passenger comfort. For operators, these investments were about more than sustainability — they also supported reliability, resilience and long-term cost control.

Older, less efficient aircraft continued to be phased out, reinforcing a shift towards smarter growth rather than simple capacity expansion.

April – Business Aviation Confirms Its Recovery

April highlighted the continued recovery of the business and private aviation sector. Operators reported strong utilisation across domestic and short-haul European routes, driven by demand for flexible, time-efficient travel.

Beyond corporate travel, business aviation continued to support a wide range of activity including medical services, energy operations and government flights, underlining its role within the broader UK aviation ecosystem.

May – UK Aerospace Manufacturing in Focus

Attention turned to the UK’s aerospace manufacturing base as global aircraft production rates increased. British suppliers played a central role in international programmes, particularly in advanced wing manufacture, systems integration and composite technologies.

Despite ongoing challenges around skills and supply chains, the sector demonstrated its strategic importance to global aerospace, supporting thousands of highly skilled jobs across the UK.

June – Preparing for a Demanding Summer

With forecasts pointing to one of the busiest summers on record, June was defined by preparation. Airports and airlines focused on improving operational resilience, investing in staffing, technology and passenger communications.

Lessons learned from previous peak seasons helped shape more coordinated planning, ensuring the industry entered summer better prepared than in recent years.

July – Record Summer Traffic Underlines Recovery

July delivered a clear confirmation of aviation’s resurgence. Passenger numbers surged across the UK, with several airports handling some of the highest volumes in their history. Leisure travel dominated, but business travel also showed steady signs of recovery.

Importantly, performance improved alongside volume, reinforcing public confidence in the sector’s ability to handle peak demand.

August – Airspace Modernisation Returns to Centre Stage

Peak summer operations once again highlighted the constraints of the UK’s complex and outdated airspace structure. August saw renewed calls for progress on airspace modernisation, widely regarded as essential for improving efficiency, reducing delays and cutting emissions.

Industry leaders stressed that modernised airspace is critical national infrastructure, not simply an aviation upgrade.

September – Regional Connectivity Back in the Spotlight

As summer demand eased, attention shifted to regional and domestic connectivity. Airlines, airports and local authorities highlighted the economic and social importance of reliable air links, particularly for remote and island communities.

Public Service Obligation routes and targeted investment were presented as vital tools in maintaining balanced national connectivity.

October – Aerospace and Space Industries Converge

October underlined the growing alignment between the UK’s aerospace and space sectors. Developments in launch capability, uncrewed systems and advanced manufacturing demonstrated how skills, infrastructure and supply chains increasingly overlap.

This convergence reinforced the UK’s ambition to play a significant role in the global space economy while creating new opportunities for traditional aerospace firms.

November – Aircraft Orders Signal Long-Term Confidence

The autumn brought renewed focus on long-term growth as airlines announced major aircraft orders and future commitments. These decisions reflected confidence extending well into the next decade, supported by expectations of sustained leisure and business travel demand.

For manufacturers and suppliers, the announcements provided valuable certainty for workforce planning and investment.

December – Sustainability, Skills and the Road Ahead

As the year closed, industry discussion turned to the future. Sustainability remained a dominant theme, alongside the growing need to attract and retain skilled workers across engineering, flight operations and digital roles.

December served as a reminder that while growth has returned, it must be delivered responsibly, inclusively and with a clear focus on long-term resilience.

Looking Ahead

Taken together, the past 12 months mark a transition from recovery to renewal for UK aviation and aerospace. Strong demand, renewed investment and accelerating sustainability efforts have reshaped the sector’s outlook.

The challenge for the year ahead will be turning ambition into delivery – modernising infrastructure, scaling cleaner fuels and ensuring the workforce is ready for the next phase of growth. If the past year is any guide, UK aviation enters that challenge with confidence.",https://ukaviation.news/wp-content/uploads/DSC03365.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 11:13:05.802897

DevvStream, Southern, IP3, and XCF to Evaluate Development of America-First Nuclear Power, Advanced Fuels, and Digital Environmental Asset Monetization

Exploring U.S.-based nuclear power as a strategic enabler for advanced fuels, AI-era infrastructure, and tokenized environmental assets

Potential to advance next-generation eSAF pathways by pairing continuous clean electricity with electrolysis, hydrogen production, and low-carbon fuel synthesis

Assessing potential pathways for leveraging American power, American feedstocks, and American infrastructure to strengthen U.S. industrial and energy leadership

Sacramento, California – December 30, 2025 – DevvStream Corp. (Nasdaq: DEVS) (“DevvStream”), a leading carbon management and environmental-asset monetization firm, today announced a non-binding memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) to evaluate a strategic collaboration focused on small modular reactor (“SMR”) nuclear power development, electro-sustainable aviation fuel (“eSAF”) production, and the creation, verification, and monetization of eligible environmental attributes alongside IP3 Corporation (“IP3”), Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (“Southern”), and XCF Global Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq: SAFX) (together “the parties”).

The MOU outlines a proposed integrated framework to assess the development and deployment of firm, zero-carbon nuclear electricity from SMRs to support clean fuel production and energy-intensive end markets, including AI data centers, while enabling robust environmental-attribute structures that may meet evolving compliance, reporting, and market standards. The MOU also outlines a framework to explore the development and deployment of SMR-generated electricity to support existing and future operating assets, including a potential nuclear power solution for a proposed SAF refinery in Louisiana, and to enable a scalable portfolio of verifiable environmental attributes.

If pursued, the parties intend to advance reliable, zero-carbon nuclear power to enable continuous electrolysis, hydrogen production, and downstream fuel synthesis, while also supporting excess clean-power offtake for third-party customers where appropriate.

The parties also intend to evaluate, as part of the negotiation of definitive agreements, environmental-attribute structures associated with eSAF and related low-carbon fuel pathways, including emerging “book-and-claim” and SAF certificate frameworks that allow airlines and corporate buyers to access verified in-sector emissions reduction attributes when physical fuel delivery is constrained.

In parallel, and pending the execution of definitive agreements, the MOU contemplates future development of digital infrastructure to enhance transparency, provenance, and auditability, including tokenization of eligible environmental assets and the use of digital measurement, reporting, and verification (“MRV”) systems to support data quality, provenance, and auditability.

“Together, we are exploring real-world asset and tokenized environmental-asset frameworks with the potential to unlock additional value, improve liquidity, and help lower the delivered cost of clean energy and fuels,” said Sunny Trinh, Chief Executive Officer of DevvStream. “We see this as a potential America-first model that combines U.S. resources, digital infrastructure, and scalable markets.”

“This MOU reflects our focus on putting American energy, infrastructure, and production first,” said Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy Renewables. “As the development of advanced nuclear platforms gains momentum, we believe the goal of developing and deploying firm, domestic power is becoming essential for fuels, manufacturing, and data-driven industries. We are committed to exploring how nuclear power, combined with U.S. biomass resources, can enable an integrated, multi-product approach that strengthens U.S. industrial leadership while remaining globally competitive.”

RDML (Ret.) Mike Hewitt, Chief Executive Officer of IP3, added: “Clean, reliable nuclear power is increasingly being pursued as foundational infrastructure for American energy security and industrial growth. We are excited to explore a strategic relationship with XCF, DevvStream, and Southern, including the potential deployment of small modular reactor technology to provide firm power and support e‑SAF production for European markets. IP3’s business model to develop infrastructure projects to privatize Small Modular Reactors for multiple offtakers such as AI and data centers that support government and commercial requirements. We believe pairing firm power development with practical environmental‑asset design and monetization can create a differentiated platform that meets real customer demand while delivering the transparency the market expects.”

“This MOU reflects XCF’s disciplined approach to evaluating infrastructure and partnerships that can strengthen the scalability, reliability, and carbon performance of next-generation sustainable aviation fuels,” said Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global. “We believe firm, zero-carbon power is an important enabler for eSAF pathways, and this collaboration, if ultimately pursued, is expected to allow us to assess how integrated power, fuel, and environmental-attribute frameworks could support broader adoption of clean fuels.”

Background

India and Brazil are natural partners in the low-carbon bioenergy transition. Brazil has decades of experience in large-scale biofuel deployment, most famously its sugarcane-based ethanol program and a mature flex-fuel vehicle market, while India has moved aggressively in recent years to scale ethanol blending and to develop policy frameworks for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The two countries formalized energy and biofuel cooperation through a series of memoranda and joint statements: New Delhi’s Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and its Brazilian counterparts highlighted SAF and biofuel collaboration in a joint statement on 21 September 2024, and broader bioenergy MOUs and bilateral instruments between India and Brazil date back several years and were reiterated during high-level exchanges in 2024–2025.

The strategic logic is straightforward. India is a fast-growing aviation market with an urgent decarbonization imperative; Brazil is a global leader in feedstock-to-biofuel value chains and has operational experience in producing low-cost, low-GHG ethanol at scale. A partnership that bridges Brazilian feedstock expertise, technology and investment with Indian market scale, refinery infrastructure and regulatory momentum offers a practical route to accelerate SAF availability in both hemispheres.

Functioning

India–Brazil cooperation on biofuels and SAF functions through several complementary channels: government-to-government frameworks, industry memoranda, technical exchanges and participation in multilateral initiatives.

At the government level, joint statements and MOUs create a policy architecture that enables dialogue on feedstock sustainability criteria, certification, testing and standards for SAF. The 2024 joint statement explicitly identified modes of cooperation that include catalysing regional value chains, ramping up SAF production, and harmonizing certification and distribution mechanisms — essential building blocks for cross-border SAF trade and “book-and-claim” schemes.

Technical and research linkages have also been institutionalized: Indian public sector refiners and research bodies have exchanged MOUs with Brazilian research institutions on bioenergy and conversion technologies (for example, cooperation involving Indian Oil Corporation and Brazilian research centers). These arrangements allow technology transfer, joint pilots (EG, waste-to-fuel pathways), and co-development of feedstock sustainability protocols that are sensitive to land-use and biodiversity concerns.

The industry needs to be involved. Brazil’s local SAF trials – such as initial “book-and-claim” pilots led by airlines and fuel companies – and India’s early state of industrialization (public and private refiner sector enthusiasm, university-industry collaboration) are resulting in on-the-ground demonstration projects that local authorities can back with money, purchasing targets, and providing regulation.

The worldwide environment is important as well: Intergovernmental bodies like the Global Biofuel Alliance (established during India’s G20 presidency) are opening up further channels to expand the good practices and draw foreign ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌investment.

Impact

Cooperation between India and Brazil on biofuels and SAF has multiple, interlocking impacts — environmental, economic and geopolitical.

Environmentally, scaling SAF reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from aviation when feedstocks and conversion pathways meet robust sustainability criteria. Brazil’s sugarcane ethanol is one of the lowest-carbon ethanol feedstocks globally, offering a model for low-GHG biofuel pathways; Coupling Brazilian expertise with Indian feedstock diversity (agricultural residues, municipal waste, non-food oilseeds) can expand low-carbon fuel supplies for regional aviation. The joint governmental emphasis on certifications and value chains intends to ensure the environmental integrity of any SAF that is produced or traded.

Economically, cooperation opens investment, trade and rural development pathways. For Brazil, diversified export markets for biofuel intermediates, technology and know-how reduce reliance on a limited set of buyers. For India, SAF and biofuel collaboration can support meeting domestic ethanol-blending targets, foster new industrial clusters (waste-to-fuel, integrated biorefineries), and generate rural employment through feedstock supply chains. Strategic supply partnerships can also mitigate fuel price volatility for airlines by providing alternative, domestically supported supply lines.

Geopolitically, stronger India–Brazil ties in low-carbon fuels help both countries exercise leadership in shaping global biofuel governance and standards. As large developing economies with agricultural footprints, their joint positions in forums such as the G20 and the Global Biofuel Alliance can influence which sustainability metrics and trade rules become mainstream, a non-trivial leverage point as SAF policy architecture and carbon markets evolve.

Performance

Assessing performance requires distinguishing policy intent, demonstration activity and commercial scaling each has progressed unevenly.

On policy intent and diplomatic signaling, performance has been strong: joint statements and MOUs since 2019 (and reiterated in 2024–2025 high-level exchanges) show sustained political will to prioritize bioenergy cooperation and to frame SAF as a shared strategic objective. The public documentation of these commitments is a positive indicator that both capitals treat the issue as part of their energy diplomacy.

On demonstrations and pilots, progress is tangible but still nascent. Brazil has operational experience with SAF pilots and book-and-claim trials (for example, Latin America’s first book-and-claim transaction involving Gol and Vibra in mid-2024), illustrating the commercial mechanics and governance challenges of non-physical SAF accounting. India has begun institutional measures (research partnerships, industry MOUs and university–aircraft maker collaborations) to replicate and adapt these models domestically, but large-scale, continuous SAF production in India remains in early stages.

On commercial scaling, both countries face constraints: feedstock competition with food uses, capital intensity of advanced conversion technologies, and the still-limited global SAF market that keeps offtake uncertain. Technical performance metrics (yields, GHG savings, lifecycle assessments) are promising for certain pathways, but translating pilots into gigalitres of SAF will require stronger policy incentives (mandates, blending targets, procurement commitments), financing instruments and clear international certification that enables trade and “book & claim” mechanisms at scale.

Way Forward

To turn policy momentum into measurable SAF volumes and lasting low-carbon impact, India and Brazil should pursue a pragmatic, multi-track agenda that accelerates supply, reduces risk and ensures sustainability.

Operationalize certification and harmonize sustainability criteria. Establish a joint technical working group to align lifecycle GHG accounting, land-use change methodologies and feedstock eligibility rules so SAF from either country is tradeable with confidence. Harmonized criteria will lower transaction costs for international buyers and support book-and-claim systems.

Scale demonstration projects with co-financing. Leverage public finance (multilateral development banks, green bonds) and blended finance to derisk first-of-a-kind commercial SAF plants in India and Brazil. Bilateral co-investment vehicles or concessional lines could mobilize private capital and ensure demonstrations focus on diverse feedstocks (sugarcane residues, municipal solid waste, used cooking oil, non-food oilseeds).

Create demand-pull via procurement and mandates. Governments and national carriers should issue time-bound procurement commitments and explore progressive blending targets for aviation where feasible. Public procurement and airport-level incentives can provide the guaranteed offtake needed to attract downstream investment. Mechanisms such as book-and-claim should be piloted with rigorous oversight to avoid greenwashing.

Promote technology exchange and skills transfer. Brazil’s operational lessons in feedstock logistics and ethanol economics should be embedded into India’s industrial plans through exchange programs, joint R&D and transfer of best practices in agronomy, processing and refinery co-processing of bio-feedstocks. Collaborative training will ensure local workforces in India can operate advanced biorefineries.

Safeguard sustainability and social inclusion. Biofuel scale-up must be accompanied by land-use safeguards, smallholder inclusion strategies, and transparent benefit-sharing arrangements. Both countries should pilot supply chain traceability and social impact monitoring to prevent adverse outcomes (eg, indirect land-use change or inequitable value capture).

Link to global markets and carbon pricing mechanisms. Position India–Brazil SAF as supply nodes in the global SAF ecosystem by negotiating mutual recognition of certifications and participating in international platforms (eg, Global Biofuel Alliance). Where appropriate, integrate SAF credits with credible carbon markets to channel finance toward the highest-integrity SAF projects.

Conclusion

India and Brazil bring complementary assets to the challenge of decarbonizing aviation: Brazil’s proven feedstock and industrial experience, and India’s growing aviation demand, refinery capabilities and policy momentum. The diplomatic commitments and MOUs of recent years have established a sound platform; the next phase must convert that platform into concrete SAF gallons through harmonized standards, financed demonstrations, demand-pull mechanisms and safeguards that prioritize sustainability and social inclusion. If executed well, India–Brazil cooperation on biofuels and SAF can not only cut aviation emissions regionally but also shape global biofuel governance offering a model of South–South cooperation that pairs technical competence with market scale.

The surge stems from predicted rapid passenger growth combined with the electrification of airport operations and emerging aviation technologies that require far more power, according to a DIA news release Monday. The airport currently uses 45 megawatts of electricity and expects to need more than 400 megawatts by 2045.

DIA handled a record 82.4 million passengers last year and projects traffic to exceed 120 million annually by 2045.

Drivers include transitioning fossil fuel-based equipment to electric to cut emissions and powering new concourses and gates, as well as a new consolidated rental car facility that anticipates rental EV power needs.

“As one of the busiest airports in the world, we are actively planning for an anticipated 120 million plus annual passengers by 2045,” Phil Washington, chief executive officer at Denver International Airport, said in the release. “Significantly more electricity will be required to power our future operations and accommodate changes coming to the aviation industry in the form of electric-powered aircraft and other advancements.”

The request seeks information on integrating clean energy solutions into the airport’s existing distribution network, as well as options for redundancy and energy storage to support peak demand now and in the future.

Washington said the airport has a responsibility to evaluate all potential clean energy sources that could meet that demand. Washington said the airport cannot wait for demand to outpace supply.

“This RFI is about gathering information so DIA can continue to be an innovative thought leader and understand more about new and emerging technologies that could help ensure the airport remains Colorado’s top economic engine for future generations,” Washington said.

The airport held five community meetings between October and December to gather input that helped develop questions included in the request.

Officials sought to examine the feasibility of an on-site small modular nuclear reactor in August but delayed the study after community criticism over a lack of prior consultation. The airport issued a request for proposals on Aug. 6 for the study, but postponed it on Aug. 8 to allow more public engagement.

Washington said the airport is committed to taking community feedback into consideration as it moves forward with efforts to learn more about potential clean energy solutions.

Residents from Montbello and Green Valley Ranch expressed strong concerns at a Dec. 17 meeting about potential health risks and environmental impacts from energy expansion, especially nuclear options. Denver City Councilmember Stacie Gilmore urged excluding nuclear. Washington flatly declined to remove nuclear from consideration, stating the airport would not limit company responses prematurely.

Washington said the airport is committed to becoming the world’s greenest airport. The airport’s current energy portfolio includes 11 solar arrays totaling 50 megawatts, with an upcoming project set to add 18 megawatts. The airport is also exploring renewable natural gas, sustainable aviation fuel, geothermal, hydrogen, wind, and battery backup to support renewables and microgrid resiliency, according to Washington.",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/b16692c6700510b785bae1e664af96d0-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 11:13:09.277369

When asked about these concerns, Klimek said, ""Premier Houston is a Nova Scotian first.
Technology has evolved, and today resource development is governed by rigorous, modern safeguards.""","HALIFAX — In the year since the Nova Scotia Progressive Conservatives under Premier Tim Houston won a resounding second mandate, the government's focus has largely been on a topic that didn't get much attention during the 2024 election campaign.

Houston's Tories have lifted a moratorium on fracking and a ban on uranium mining, and opened calls for offshore oil and gas exploration bids. They've introduced measures to streamline both the environmental assessments for energy projects and the permitting processes for mining. And the premier laid out plans for a massive offshore wind energy development.

To top it off, in October, Houston named himself energy minister.

Political science experts say that had Houston given voters details about his energy ideas, the November election campaign — after which the Progressive Conservatives won 43 out of 55 seats — may have looked different.

“If there had been more details about critical minerals, what that means for private property potentially, that would have been the dominant discussion in the election campaign,” Tom Urbaniak, a political scientist at Cape Breton University, said in an interview Tuesday.

“There wasn’t specific discussion about uranium or fracking, or even the fact that (natural resource development) would be the headline push of the second mandate,” Urbaniak said.

Instead, the Progressive Conservative campaign focused on lowering some taxes, raising the minimum wage, and hiring more doctors to support the health system. Much of those promises have been fulfilled. The Department of Health says there are 453 more physicians working in Nova Scotia now than in 2021 when the Progressive Conservatives were first elected. The department was not immediately able to provide the number of new doctors hired since the November 2024 election.

To address affordability, the premier pledged to ""ensure power-rate fairness"" by capping increases to the Canadian average, which has not yet happened. The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a question about progress toward implementing the promised cap.

Lori Turnbull, a political scientist with Dalhousie University, said Tuesday that political parties never do exactly what they include in campaign materials, because unpredictable challenges arise once they enter office.

""But I think the question is, did you intentionally not tell us because you knew it would be controversial, and you didn't want the campaign to be taken over by something like this? Because it is an issue that is polarizing,"" Turnbull said, adding that she can't speculate on when Houston decided he would make a push for natural resource development.

""If you start talking about the possibility of fracking, possibility of opening up uranium mines, and all of the environmental and health risks that go along with that, that's the type of thing that, even though it might not be anyone's Number 1 issue … these other things can become the split issue in the campaign,"" she said.

On the campaign trail, the premier did not hold a stand-alone press conference to highlight his natural resources plans, as he did with many election promises. The campaign material said, ""the path to future economic prosperity must include a refocusing back to our natural resources."" It made note of critical mineral potential, without specifics, and said efforts will be made to develop sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen.

When asked why natural resource development was not emphasized as a key issue on the campaign trail, a spokesperson for the premier said Houston made it clear to voters he would be focused on growing the economy.

""Then (U.S.) President Trump launched a tariff war against Canada. That made it even clearer we must be more self-sufficient — at a time when a new prime minister is pushing Canada to be an energy superpower and our deficit remains a reality. So we acted,"" said Catherine Klimek.

There has been criticism over Houston's speedy push for mining and natural resource development, with the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs raising concerns in June about government failing to consult with them before the province issued a request for exploration proposals for three sites with known deposits of uranium in. No companies came forward with a bid.

Environmental advocates, meanwhile, have said they worry about the potential environmental and health risks tied to fracking and uranium mining.

When asked about these concerns, Klimek said, ""Premier Houston is a Nova Scotian first. He would never put our province at risk. Technology has evolved, and today resource development is governed by rigorous, modern safeguards.""

On Dec. 22, the government said it was putting Dalhousie University in charge of a $30-million program that will see a call for onshore natural-gas exploration in the new year. Officials said new natural-gas development will allow the province to cut back on burning coal for electricity generation and help it hit its 2030 emission targets.

However, a former university president who oversaw the report that led to a decade-long ban on fracking in Nova Scotia has questioned the government’s claims that natural gas would lower emissions and energy prices.
