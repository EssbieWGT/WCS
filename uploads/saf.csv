The data gathered will inform US and international regulators of new established noise thresholds to help pave the return of faster commercial flights across the world.

Elsewhere, a new crop of tech innovators, itching to help passengers fly not just quicker, but quieter, greener, and (hopefully) more affordably, are making serious moves.

It’s a development that not only Concorde fans are watching with eager anticipation. Since the fleet’s retirement on November 26, 2003, waved off by a crowd of cheering well-wishers at Heathrow Airport, air travel has changed dramatically – but not for the better. Flights these days are a grim chore to be endured, unless you rank among the super-wealthy elite, whether that’s due to the “premium carriers” (naming no names), or the aggressive surcharges of budget brands.

So who is leading the charge on this second wave of supersonic travel? Step forward 44-year-old American tech entrepreneur Blake Scholl.

The founder of the aptly named Boom Supersonic company is aiming to deliver passengers from London to Denver, Colorado, where he lives in just six to seven hours; the time difference will mean they arrive at the same time.

A high school dropout turned computer science graduate from Carnegie Mellon University, Scholl went on to work with Amazon and Groupon as a software engineer. And the father-of-four has a lifelong passion for flying after his parents took him to watch turboprop Cessnas taking flight near their home in Cincinnati, Ohio.

He only wishes his own children had been lucky enough to experience supersonic flights so that they might have seen their grandfather who lived in Hong Kong more, rather than having to endure an 18-hour flight.

“I always wanted to fly on Concorde, but it last flew in 2003 and I couldn’t afford a ticket back then,” he tells the Express. “When I saw Concorde, it was in a museum in Seattle [in 2007].

“It made me sad to think that this amazing aircraft was sitting in a museum, and nothing better was flying people around. I never understood why no one had picked up where Concorde left off, so I decided to find out.”

One factor that hamstrung the first phase of commercial supersonic flight was the 1973 ban on sonic booms over America. This meant Concorde could only ever reach top speed over the Atlantic. The US ban, although mainly due to complaints from booms caused by military aircraft, was due in part to fears that a new wave of supersonic passenger planes would make sitting in the “yard” an ordeal.

It stood until 2025, when Donald Trump, himself an avid flyer already facing controversy over his attempt to secure a new presidential jet from Qatar, tore it up as part of his effort to “to spur innovation and economic growth”.

Much of the rest of the world, including Europe, have their own “boom bans” but innovators including Blake hope that domestic success over the US – as the resurrected Atlantic crossing, plus overseas travel between Los Angeles and Tokyo and Singapore and Australia – will prompt a travel revolution.

Despite its name, ironically the company will ensure its Overture aircraft have only a quiet or even inaudible “boom” due to “Mach cutoff”, which means the sonic waves are refracted in the atmosphere and do not reach ground level.

With 130 orders from major airlines already in hand, the Overture certainly seems to be the most plausible option in the coming years for supersonic fliers. Once greenlit for departure, it will fly at twice the speed of today’s airliners, cruising at Mach 1.7.

Scholl, is evangelical about his company’s mission, previously stating: “There’s no reason we can’t make it work. Look at our record. The analysts said a startup can’t build a supersonic jet. Only governments have ever done that. We built one. Then they said there’s no market for supersonic. But airlines are ordering. Now they say we’ll never be able to build an engine. So far, we’ve proved them wrong on everything.

“The day we broke the sound barrier I stood with the team, and I said: 'The reason we’re here today is because we didn’t give up when reasonable people would have given up'. The way we get Overture done is a whole lot of not giving up. We’re not going to give up.”

So it’s no surprise he’s been dubbed “the Elon Musk of aviation”.

So far, Boom’s test aircraft, the XB-1, has broken the sound barrier six times without creating an audible sonic boom.

Mock-ups of Overture’s cabins also show a return to luxury travel with wood inlays, high-end food and roomy seats, with a firm promise of less flight turbulence since passengers will spend the duration of their time at a dizzying 60,000ft.

What about fares, though? The company is understandably elliptical on this point, telling the Express: “Ultimately, fares are up to our airline partners. We’ve designed Overture to be profitable for airlines at fares similar to first and business class across hundreds of transoceanic routes.”

Some think that billionaires will nab all the seats, and keep the rest of us in the slow lane. But there is no reason not to imagine that as the technology spreads, prices could not come down dramatically.

There are concerns, though. Tech visionaries have developed something of a reputation for overpromising and underdelivering, if delivering at all.

And the Overture will be a little slower than Concorde, while it's suspected that any trans-Pacific flight would require a refuelling stop. “Concorde was a technological marvel of her time and we stand on her shoulders as we progress towards a supersonic future,” a Boom spokesperson tells the Express. “However, Concorde was never built to be economically or environmentally sustainable. Overture’s purpose-built Symphony engine is designed to run on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel.”

Aviation expert Jonathan Glancey, author of the definitive Concorde: The Rise and Fall of the Supersonic Airliner believes the Boom Overture “could have a profitable niche as a smart and very fast supersonic jet for business executives”.

But, he adds, Concorde “caught the mood of an era” in a way that Boom may struggle to do.

“Concorde was, quite simply, very beautiful, its beauty created through its very speed and the engineering form necessary to make that speed possible and operational,” says the writer of the newly published book V-Force: Britain's Nuclear Bombers and the Cold War.

“Its design is all of a piece. The Boom Overture has engines hanging from the wings and lacks the purity of Concorde’s form.

“Concorde flew a very particular route that drew a powerful, influential, glamorous and regular clientele; it was like a club at 50,000-ft at Mach 2 over the Atlantic. I’m not sure if this can be replicated”.

Indeed, if you dismiss the embarrassingly dangerous Soviet copycat, Concorde ploughed a lonely supersonic furrow during its decades of dominance. That was until the dream hit tragedy.

In July 2000, horror struck, when Air France Flight 4590 crashed into a hotel shortly after takeoff from Paris, killing all 113 people on board and four others on the ground. Debris on the runway had pierced a tyre, with fragments of the wheel causing a fuel tank fire when the aircraft was already travelling too fast to abort takeoff.

The disaster sent shockwaves through the aviation world, raising serious concerns about safety, due to a succession of wheel-related incidents. Though modifications and upgrades followed, Concorde never fully recovered. Maintenance costs, low passenger numbers, and the fear and lack of demand prompted by 9/11 led to its eventual retirement.

Whether Boom can now build nearly 10 times the number of Concordes which ever entered commercial service is highly ambitious, especially after Virgin let its order for 10 of the craft expire in 2023. The plane would consume much more fuel than regular jets (Concorde supposedly used two tons of fuel taxiing) and the company’s suggestion that operators purchase sustainable aviation fuel and carbon credits to keep things net-zero is vague, if not implausible.

And while supersonic flight certainly sounds appealing, could the technology be blown out of the water by hypersonic trips, which would make anywhere in the world accessible in two hours? Flights at 3,800mph and above could see you leave London, make it to Tokyo for a sushi lunch and be in the States for dinner.

Add AI into the mix and the possibilities get even more exciting. The most advanced concept could be Hyperian Aerospace’s Hyperliner, a Mach 10 (7,600mph) powered by hydrogen that could fly from New York to London in under 30 minutes, or from New York to Sydney in an hour and a half.

Sound implausible?

The plans remain on the drawing board… for now.

But whether we’re facing a super – or hypersonic revolution, perhaps one thing is certain – the age of “long haul flights” could soon be consigned to the history books. And, unlike Concorde, judging by today’s swathe of airline complaints, there will be few to mourn its passing.",https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/1200x630/6436729.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 13:56:08.358075

The once in a three-year event is held to establish global policy and review ICAO’s work.

ICAO’s Global Framework sets an aspirational target for a 5% reduction in CO2 emissions from international aviation through the use of SAF, Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF), and other cleaner energies by 2030.

India has set targets of a 1% SAF blend by 2027, 2% by 2028, and 5% by 2030 for international flights in line with compliance to the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

The study calls for urgent policy measures such as a the setting up of a SAF Council with high-level representatives from government departments and CEOs from relevant stakeholders to develop a vision and strategy for the domestic SAF sector. It also presses for urgent action to establish a policy framework for SAF development in India to find solutions for various challenges including slow commercialisation of technologies, and high production costs.

Among the various pathways for production of sustainable aviation fuel, the study recommends SAF through the alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) process as the “largest opportunity for India” as there arefeedstock options available for ethanol and because of ease of transportation and aggregation. However, it also cautions about competing demand for ethanol from the road transport sector, where ethanol-blended petrol (E20) is gaining traction. The report also said that ethanol from food crops (or first generation or 1G ethanol) is more attractive option in the present moment because of the slow pace of scale up of second generation (2G) ethanol that is produced from non-food biomass like agricultural residues, grasses, wood, and other lignocellulosic materials.",https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png,N,,2025-09-20 12:56:10.326802

La aerolínea premium con sede en Hong Kong Cathay Pacific acaba de ser reconocida en los Premios de Sostenibilidad Airline Ratings 2025, como ganadora de la categoría de ‘Compañías aéreas de servicio completo’. Las numerosas iniciativas sostenibles puestas en práctica a lo largo de sus operaciones de vuelos comerciales y carga aérea la han hecho merecedora de este prestigioso reconocimiento.

Cathay Pacific continúa trabajando con el objetivo de alcanzar el hito de las cero emisiones netas de carbono para el año 2050 y abanderar la transición hacia un uso circular de los recursos, con soluciones basadas en dar una segunda vida a los residuos generado. Todo ello bajo su visión de hacer avanzar a las personas, siguiendo una filosofía sostenible y respetuosa con el medio ambiente.

‘La sostenibilidad es un asunto esencial para el futuro de la aviación. Se trata de cuestiones muy complejas que solo podemos resolverse avanzando de forma sopesada y colaborativa, de la mano de todos los actores que formamos parte del sector: desde clientes, socios comerciales, proveedores... hasta nuestros propios equipos, y por supuesto, la administración y la sociedad en general’, declara Grace Cheung, directora general de Sostenibilidad de Cathay.

‘Para nosotros es un honor que se reconozcan nuestros esfuerzos mientras seguimos trazando el camino hacia la sostenibilidad y la innovación en el sector. Solo con el esfuerzo de todos podemos avanzar hacia el objetivo común’, añade.

La estrategia de sostenibilidad del Grupo Cathay se centra en abordar el impacto del cambio climático mediante la modernización de su flota, el aumento de la eficiencia del combustible y el uso de combustible de aviación sostenible, SAF. La integración nuevas tecnologías y de la economía circular para la gestión de los residuos generados en cabina y su reciclaje son otros de los principales pilares.

Economía circular y gestión de residuos

Cathay sigue avanzando en la adopción de soluciones más circulares para el uso de sus recursos. En concreto, la aerolínea Cathay Pacific se ha comprometido a rebajar su dependencia de los plásticos de un solo uso, SUP, con la promesa de reducir su uso destinado a pasajeros de 7,7 unidades por pasajero en 2019 a 1,5 unidades a finales de 2025.

Al término del año pasado, Cathay Pacific ya había reducido el uso de los SUP hasta las 2,6 unidades por pasajero.

A bordo de sus aviones, Cathay ha introducido múltiples medidas mejoradas para impulsar el reciclaje de botellas de agua, con más de 1,4 millones de botellas de plástico recicladas desde que se introdujeron estas medidas en 2024. Mientras tanto, todas las botellas de agua de los vuelos con salida desde Hong Kong están fabricadas con plástico 100% reciclado (rPET), con el objetivo de mejorar la circularidad del uso del plástico en las operaciones de Cathay.

Para reducir aún más los residuos plásticos, la aerolínea ha estado explorando materiales alternativos, como el papel reciclado para envolver los auriculares y las mantas, en lugar del plástico. También se están realizando pruebas para explorar la implementación de más vajilla reutilizable en cabina en la clase Economy, con el fin de minimizar los artículos de un solo uso a bordo.

Acción climática y combustibles alternativos

El SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel, o combustible de aviación sostenible, es considerado por la industria como la palanca más importante para la descarbonización de la aviación. Cathay lanzó el programa Corporate SAF en 2022 para ayudar a acelerar la transición al SAF, permitiendo a las empresas asociadas abordar sus emisiones indirectas relativas a los servicios de transporte aéreo y carga.

En los últimos años, Cathay ha implementado con éxito la incorporación del uso de SAF en sus vuelos tanto en Hong Kong como en otros aeropuertos por todo el mundo.

Este año, Cathay ha anunciado tres nuevos acuerdos de compra y asociación para el uso de SAF. Entre ellos, destaca la asociación con Sinopec para repostar algunos de los vuelos de Cathay Pacific con salida desde el Aeropuerto Internacional de Hong Kong con SAF mezclado, con SK Energy para algunos vuelos con salida desde Corea del Sur y con DHL Express para transportar SAF mezclado en algunos vuelos operados por su aerolínea de carga urgente, Air Hong Kong, en los aeropuertos de Seúl–Incheon, Tokio–Narita y Singapur–Changi.

Además, Cathay se ha aliado con socios de toda la cadena de valor para promover el desarrollo de una política de apoyo a la producción de SAF desde en su hub de operaciones en Hong Kong.",https://www.expreso.info/files/styles/expreso_theme_teaser_secundario_desktop/public/2025-09/Cathay_premio.jpg?itok=Viqk4SGA,N,,2025-09-20 17:56:13.648926

As of Q2 2025, the sector's three dominant players—Lufthansa Group, Air France-KLM, and International Airlines Group (IAG)—exhibit stark contrasts in profitability, underscoring the importance of route optimization, cost management, and demand resilience in a volatile market.

Comparative Performance: IAG's Outlier Success

IAG's operating margin of 19.0% in Q2 2025Q2 2025 European Airlines Performance - The Big Three[ 2 ] stands in sharp contrast to Lufthansa Group's 8.3% and Air France-KLM's 8.7%Q2 2025 European Airlines Performance - The Big Three[ 2 ]. This disparity is largely attributable to IAG's transatlantic dominance, where demand has surged post-pandemic. According to a report by IATA, transatlantic routes accounted for 35% of IAG's operating profit growth year-over-yearQ2 2025 European Airlines Performance - The Big Three[ 2 ], driven by pent-up demand and a shift toward premium cabin upgrades. Meanwhile, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM faced rising unit costs from airport fees, inflation, and costly cabin modernization projectsQ2 2025 European Airlines Performance - The Big Three[ 2 ], which eroded margins despite revenue growth.

Lufthansa's Q2 2025 revenue of €10.3 billionQ2 2025 European Airlines Performance - The Big Three[ 2 ] and Air France-KLM's €8.44 billionQ2 2025 European Airlines Performance - The Big Three[ 2 ] reflect a broader trend of revenue stabilization, but both airlines remain below IATA's projected post-pandemic operating margin range of 10–12%Q2 2025 European Airlines Performance - The Big Three[ 2 ]. This gap highlights the challenges of balancing capacity adjustments with cost inflation, particularly for legacy carriers with complex network structures.

Sector-Wide Trends: Profitability and Risks

On a regional scale, the IATA forecasts net profits for European airlines to reach $36.0 billion in 2025, up from $32.4 billion in 2024Airline Profitability to Strengthen Slightly in 2025[ 3 ]. Total revenues are projected to hit a record $979 billionAirline Profitability to Strengthen Slightly in 2025[ 3 ], with passenger revenues ($693 billion) and ancillary income (e.g., baggage fees, seat upgrades) as key drivers. However, air cargo revenues are expected to decline by 4.7%Airline Profitability to Strengthen Slightly in 2025[ 3 ] due to slowing global trade and geopolitical tensions, compounding pressure on diversified carriers like Lufthansa.

Fuel costs, a critical variable for airlines, are anticipated to fall to an average of $86/barrel in 2025 from $99 in 2024Airline Profitability to Strengthen Slightly in 2025[ 3 ], offering some relief. Yet, the transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) introduces new risks: SAF is projected to cost 4.2 times more than conventional jet fuel in 2025Airline Profitability to Strengthen Slightly in 2025[ 3 ], potentially offsetting savings from lower oil prices.

Strategic Implications for Investors

The data underscores a bifurcated recovery: IAG's agility in leveraging transatlantic demand and cost discipline positions it as a standout performer, while Lufthansa and Air France-KLM face structural headwinds. For investors, this suggests a cautious approach to legacy carriers, with a focus on airlines that can scale ancillary revenue streams and mitigate SAF costs through partnerships or regulatory incentives.

However, the sector's overall resilience—evidenced by IATA's revised profitability forecastsAirline Profitability to Strengthen Slightly in 2025[ 3 ]—indicates that European airlines are adapting to a new normal. The key differentiator will be the ability to balance short-term margin pressures with long-term sustainability goals, particularly as SAF mandates gain traction.

Conclusion

The European airline sector's recovery in 2025 is a tale of two strategies: innovation-driven growth and cost-centric survival. While IAG's performance demonstrates the rewards of strategic focus on high-demand corridors, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM must navigate a more complex landscape of rising costs and regulatory shifts. For investors, the path forward lies in identifying airlines that can harmonize profitability with sustainability, ensuring long-term value in an industry still redefining itself post-pandemic.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1758365296989.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-20 12:56:51.943892

A New Fiscal Authority in the Making

President Prabowo Subianto has proposed the establishment of a National Revenue Agency (Badan Penerimaan Negara, BPN), a central authority directly under the president, led by a minister-level head. Its mission is to unify and optimize state revenues across sectors, plug fiscal leakages, and strengthen the government’s ability to mobilize resources.

While this may sound like a technical reform in taxation and non-tax revenues, the implications for Indonesia’s aviation industry are far-reaching. Aviation is not merely a source of direct taxes and fees; it is a strategic enabler of connectivity, tourism, trade, and investment. The way BPN reshapes fiscal flows could directly affect airlines, airports, air navigation providers, general aviation, and the vast supply chain that supports them.

The central question is simple yet profound: will BPN become a catalyst for efficiency and growth in aviation, or will it add a new bureaucratic burden on an industry still recovering from the pandemic?

How Aviation Contributes to State Revenue

Aviation contributes to state coffers through several channels:

Taxes: corporate income tax from airlines, VAT on tickets, and import duties on aircraft and spare parts.

Non-Tax State Revenues (PNBP): air navigation fees, aircraft registration, certification, and personnel licensing.

Concession and royalties: from airports operated under public-private partnerships.

Regional levies: linked to aviation services such as parking or permits.

Although its direct fiscal share is modest compared to mining or energy, aviation’s multiplier effect is immense: every rupiah collected generates multiple rupiah in tourism, commerce, and logistics.

The Potential Upside of BPN

If designed well, BPN could bring four key benefits to aviation:

Integrated Data and Transparency: Currently, revenue collection in aviation is fragmented across ministries and agencies. A unified system could provide clearer insights, enabling evidence-based fiscal policy.

Reduced Bureaucratic Burden: Airlines often face multiple agencies when handling fiscal obligations. BPN could act as a one-stop authority, lowering compliance costs.

Strategic Incentives: With direct reporting to the president, BPN could craft tax incentives to attract investment: reduced import duties for maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO), tax holidays for aviation training centres, or green incentives for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Leakage Prevention: By deploying digital platforms, perhaps even blockchain-based ledgers, BPN could close loopholes in non-tax revenue collection and minimize corruption risks.

The Risks and Challenges

- Advertisement -

Still, the aviation industry must prepare for potential pitfalls:

Over-Regulation: If BPN adds another layer of bureaucracy rather than simplifying processes, operators could face heavier compliance burdens.

Jurisdictional Overlap: Aviation is already regulated by the Ministry of Transportation and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). Fiscal oversight by BPN must not interfere with technical safety oversight, or conflicts may arise.

Excessive Fiscalization: If BPN prioritizes short-term revenue targets, higher taxes or fees could increase ticket prices, reduce competitiveness, and deter investment.

Centre-Region Tensions: Aviation revenues are unevenly distributed across regions, with hubs like Bali and Jakarta contributing disproportionately. Unless BPN ensures fair revenue-sharing formulas, local governments may resist.

Global Lessons

Other countries offer useful comparisons:

Singapore: integrates aviation revenue collection under the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) but balances it with pro-investment tax policies.

United Arab Emirates: maintains a low-tax, high-service regime that attracts global aviation players while ensuring robust infrastructure investment.

United States: channels aviation-related revenues into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, reinvesting directly into aviation infrastructure.

The clear lesson: fiscal collection must go hand-in-hand with reinvestment in aviation capacity.

Policy Recommendations

To ensure BPN strengthens rather than weakens aviation, three steps are critical:

Stakeholder Dialogue: BPN should consult with airlines, airports, navigation providers, pilots, and passengers before introducing new fiscal schemes.

Digital Integration: Fiscal transactions in aviation must be digitized and interconnected in real time between BPN, DGCA, and the Ministry of Finance.

Balanced Incentives: BPN should adopt a “just culture” in fiscal management: penalize deliberate evasion but allow corrective mechanisms for administrative errors. It should also design green incentives, reinvesting part of aviation revenues into sustainable fuel, training, and infrastructure.

A Double-Edged Reform

The creation of a National Revenue Agency marks a bold fiscal reform. For aviation, the stakes are high: a well-implemented BPN could deliver efficiency, transparency, and sustainability. A poorly designed one could suffocate growth through over-regulation and fiscal overreach.

Indonesia must avoid treating aviation solely as a revenue cow. Instead, BPN should see it as a strategic enabler of national growth. If fiscal collection is balanced with reinvestment, the country can strengthen both its fiscal sovereignty and its aviation competitiveness.

In the end, the choice is not between revenue and growth—it is about ensuring revenue fuels growth. For aviation, that means keeping the skies open, safe, and competitive, while making sure every rupiah collected contributes to Indonesia’s long-term journey toward global aviation leadership.

An interview with Robert Chad, area manager who oversees France, Belgium, The Netherlands & Southern Europe (Italy, Greece, Cyprus, and Malta), and all our member airlines in these markets.

How has the policy focus evolved in your markets since the pandemic?

Many of the markets witnessed a strong resurgence, which was often referred to as “Travel Revenge”. This is a testimony that people view travel as an essential part of their life. We have seen diverse responses in terms of policy making, from abusive increased airport charges, and imposed noise restrictions (of which Amsterdam and Brussels are the most emblematic), to efforts in support of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and everything in between. In France, we are witnessing a full spectrum of policies affecting aviation.

This includes a 200 million EUR support for Sustainable Aviation Fuel projects, but also the flight ban on routes that can be operated by rail in less than 2h30 (a symbolic measure with little environmental benefit), as well as a significant tax hike. 2025 has also seen a drastic increase of the Solidarity Tax, which further questions the consistency of the government’s approach towards aviation, which is referred to as a “sector of excellence” for the country. But then again, all this is not surprising considering France has boasted five (!) different Transport ministers since the COVID19 pandemic… and we may have a sixth one in the coming days. To that extent, at the end of 2024, we issued and shared a Policy Brief to illustrate the importance of aviation and the necessary steps for the government to take.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels represent the main solution for the industry to deliver its Fly Net Zero 2050 commitment. What update can you provide, notably on the required sufficient availability and ‘affordable’ pricing, as well as the book and claim system?

All governments in my cluster are now fully aware of this, but responses differ. Some countries have a clear roadmap to reach the 2050 goal, while others are only now setting up decarbonization roundtables to discuss the way forward, and some have neither of these advances in place. From our discussions with policymakers, there is a clear acknowledgement of the need of a Book and Claim system, however, some raise the concern of the challenge to effectively control and track the environmental benefit across the process. We need to come up with an optimal solution, as SAF will not be available in all airports, at least not in the coming years. At our last AGM in Delhi, the pricing distortion point was clearly addressed. Many of our members had to pay unreasonable SAF compliance fees due to the current market conditions.

As of late, we have been witnessing increasing aviation bashing and greenwashing measures from Governments. What actions have you or will you put in place to counter this trend?

The political ‘panic’ response to pressure aviation is risky and can have disastrous effects on the sector and the economy in general. IATA published late last year a series of Value of Aviation reports, which highlight the criticality of the sector for connectivity, economies, and societies. In France, we went one step further by sharing the Policy Brief with all the Parliament Members to ensure these policymakers acquire a full understanding of the importance of their decisions with regards to our industry.

Airlines are committed to addressing their environmental footprint. This includes “noise”, which is now clear to all policymakers. Unfortunately, after the flight capping at Amsterdam, others such as Brussels have considered following suit, often without applying the necessary Balanced Approach. Governments should look at the sector with ‘unbiased’ fresh eyes, fully understanding the value and benefits of aviation, the connectivity it provides, and keep in mind that the industry supports 15 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This would facilitate smarter policymaking, stability and consistency.

Italy represents a best practice when it comes to accessibility, notably with the ‘One Click Away’ project. How can we ensure other countries follow in its footsteps?",https://caribbeannewsglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/robert_chad.png,N,,2025-09-20 09:56:57.233434

According to the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), airspace modernisation can be defined as “improving our airspace structure through new technology, including more accurate satellite-based navigation, and introducing more efficient flight paths.” The U.K. Department for Transport also states that, despite great technological advances, the basic design of U.K. airspace hasn’t significantly changed in 70 years.

According to the BBC, back in the 1950s, when the airspace was originally designed, there were around 200,000 flights in U.K. airspace annually. Last year, the U.K. handled 2.7 million flights. If you cast your mind back to the 1950s, Boeing had just brought their first jetliner to market, the 707, which entered service with Pan Am in 1958.

Why Modernising Airspace Matters Now

Since then, the two largest manufacturers in the aviation sector, Boeing and Airbus, have introduced 15 different commercial airliners between them, with many variants of the different aircraft being released. Each has contained new technologies, making aviation safer and greener for the billions of passengers who have flown on Boeing and Airbus aircraft over the years.

With this in mind, it is easy to see how these aviation technology advancements have changed flight, but airspace and the way we use it have not kept pace. This means that we are not experiencing the full potential benefits of the new technology on offer.

Technological Advances Driving Change

Among the largest technological advancements made have been the ETOPS ratings achieved by some of the new generation passenger aircraft. ETOPS stands for “Extended range Twin-engine Operations Performance Standards.” In 2017, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) introduced another term for this, EDTO, which stands for “Estimated Diversion Time Operations.” The two terms have a similar meaning, and both are still widely used in aviation today.

These ratings essentially refer to how far an aircraft of a particular type can be, during any one journey, from an airport suitable for landing. As time and technology have progressed, the ETOPS ratings achieved have become higher, which means that when routing a flight, airlines are able to fly a more direct route. Some of the newest generation aircraft certified for ETOPS 370 can be up to 6 hours and 10 minutes from the nearest airport at any given point during the flight, depending on the ETOPS certification of the operator on that given aircraft type. This certification is a dual certification, with both the aircraft and the operator achieving a rating.

In the past, many transatlantic flights from Europe flew north to remain in close proximity to airports along the route in case of an emergency. Now that newer aircraft are certified to be further from airports, airlines can take a more direct route, meaning faster flights, less fuel and also the potential for taking advantage of jet streams along the way.

This change has also connected cities that historically would not have been able to have direct flights between them due to large ocean expanses. Modernising our airspace will continue to enable operators around the world to fly the most efficient routes to their destinations, not held back by rules designed 70 years ago when both aircraft and navigation technology were much less advanced.

Integrating Drones and Air Taxis (eVTOLs) Into Airspace

As well as the technology on conventional aircraft improving, there is also an emerging technology element that is necessitating the modernisation of our airspace. According to the Department for Transport, safe integration of drones into air traffic management is one of the key reasons for modernising U.K. airspace. Drones have continued to take their place as a useful tool for many different industries, including construction, surveying, photography and agriculture, as well as for enthusiasts.

Alongside drones and airspace integration, regulators around the world are starting to consider the certification of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft as air taxis and for cargo carriage. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) and Joby have agreed to a partnership aiming to launch a commercial air taxi service by 2026. Joby estimate that a flight from Dubai International Airport to Palm Jumeirah will take just 10 minutes, a journey which is typically 45 minutes by car.

In China, EHang have now started commercial passenger operations in Guangzhou and Hefei, offering tourists low-altitude sightseeing flights. With these aircraft getting closer and closer to becoming everyday users of our airspace, it is clear to see that changes will be needed to accommodate this in a safe manner.

Environmental Benefits of Airspace Modernization

Another key benefit of airspace modernisation concerns the environment. In the U.K., there is a target set by the government for Net Zero by 2050. All industries are looking inwards at their operations to make changes to their operation to be able to comply with this, and the aviation sector is no different. One of the primary benefits of airspace modernisation for the environment is the immediate reduction in carbon emissions.

Whilst other means of reducing carbon emissions are being worked on, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), huge reductions in carbon emissions can be made, by enabling aircraft to fly optimal routes. These airspace changes for sustainable aviation facilitate more frequent continuous climbs and descents, thereby requiring less engine power. Modernisation also helps minimize delays, which will reduce the need for aircraft to be held in holding patterns and burn extra fuel, which is currently commonplace around the U.K.’s busiest airports.

According to the Department for Transport, one modernisation measure in the southwest of England has already been estimated to save 12,000 tonnes a year—enough to power seven trips around the world. Further modernisation plans are expected to deliver even greater results, with easyJet estimating it could reduce its emissions by up to 10% with airspace improvements across Europe. With a nationwide deployment, it is easy to see how these environmental benefits can start to add up.

Global Initiatives: U.K, U.S. and Europe Leading the Way

Whilst this article references the U.K. term “airspace modernisation,” this is very much a worldwide effort, with many of the world’s leaders in aviation currently looking at their airspace design. In the U.S., the FAA have started a project known as Next Generation Air Transport System (NextGen). Similarly, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) have started a project known as Single European Sky (SES).

In the U.K. alone, GBP750 million is being invested in airspace technologies according to the National Air Traffic Services (NATS), while the U.S. announced an additional USD12.5 billion of funding for the upgrading of their air traffic control system, taking their total to USD31.5 billion.

Ultimately, airspace modernisation is, to use the U.K. phrasing, very much a hot topic across the world’s major aviation powers, drawing significant investment as we look towards a greener, safer and more diverse aviation industry.

Recently, Pieter Elbers, the CEO of IndiGo Airlines, shared the current journey and future outlook in an exclusive interview with Airways.
Pieter Elbers reflected on the fleet strategy and the transition to widebodies, moving from Boeing 777s to 787s to the new A350s.
Elbers: “IndiGo started just 19 years ago—it’s still a very young airline.
Three years ago, we had 20 international destinations; today, we have over 40.","NEW DELHI — India’s largest airline, IndiGo (6E), rose to its position in just 19 years from its inception. 6E boasts the largest domestic share in India, with revenues exceeding US$9 billion for FY 2024-25. Once starting as a low-cost carrier (LCC), 6E has sailed away from being a conventional LCC to more of a hybrid airline.

Recently, Pieter Elbers, the CEO of IndiGo Airlines, shared the current journey and future outlook in an exclusive interview with Airways. Having been part of 6E for the past three years, Pieter reflects that this time is “exciting”, especially with the aviation industry's return to air travel following the COVID-19 pandemic.

The airline began operations with its first flight to Imphal (IMF) from New Delhi (DEL) in 2005, featuring 100 Airbus A320 aircraft in its order book. Currently, the airline has more than 430 aircraft in its fleet with one of the youngest fleet ages of just 4.6 years. Pieter Elbers reflected on the fleet strategy and the transition to widebodies, moving from Boeing 777s to 787s to the new A350s.

IndiGo recently exercised purchase options for additional widebody aircraft, taking the total order from 30 to 60 A350s. How do you view this in terms of strategy and transition?

Elbers: “IndiGo started just 19 years ago—it’s still a very young airline. We take pride in being the first airline in the world to reach 100 million annual customers in under 17 years of operation. Three years ago, we had 20 international destinations; today, we have over 40.

The A321 fleet allows us to serve much of Asia, but with the XLR arriving by the end of this year, we will stretch into significant parts of Europe and Asia. However, even the XLR has limitations. That’s where the A350 order comes in—it allows us to connect India to places like Manchester, Tokyo, or Sydney, where Indian carriers currently have little or no presence.

That’s why we decided to double the order from 30 to 60 A350s. They are expected to arrive around 2027–28. Until then, we are bridging the gap with the Boeing 787. These are being operated in a damp-lease arrangement, meaning the operator provides pilots and maintenance, while cabin crew are IndiGo’s. So, the transition will be relatively smooth.”

Long-Haul International Operations

At the beginning of July, 6E started their first long-haul international flights to Amsterdam (AMS) and Manchester (MAN) from Mumbai (BOM). Thanks to the damp-leased Boeing 787 from Norse Atlantic (N0), the routes have attracted considerable attention among passengers, as it is the sole operator to Manchester.

IndiGo’s widebody operations to Manchester and Amsterdam have attracted attention. What has been the passenger response so far?

Elbers: “The response has been very positive. Manchester, for example, is the only nonstop connection to India, and it was warmly welcomed by the large Indian diaspora there. Awareness of IndiGo was already strong, so not much marketing was required.

Amsterdam is different—it’s a market already served by KLM and Air India. But we’ve seen encouraging load factors and connecting traffic, not just to India but also to Thailand and Sri Lanka. That’s why we stepped up frequency: Manchester from three to four per week, Amsterdam from three to six. It is proof of the positive market response from this point.”

During my recent flight from AMS to BOM on 6E22, I met passengers traveling further to Bangkok, which shows a positive outlook from the passengers' point of view. But one of the bottlenecks faced, especially in an airport like AMS, is the slot constraints.

The bilateral agreement allows airlines to operate between the two countries, but KLM has a significantly larger operation in India compared to Indian airlines in the Netherlands. Elbers added that the airline is in frequent contact with the Indian government to address this issue, which also closely monitors it.

Welcoming A321XLR

IndiGo announced 10 new destinations, including Athens (ATH), Copenhagen (CPH), and London (LHR). In addition, the airline is set to welcome one of the latest aircraft types, the Airbus A321XLR, to its fleet. The XLR will enable the airline to add additional destinations, thanks to its extended range capability.

The airline recently announced Athens as the launch route for the XLR, with Elbers commenting, “XLRs are bought exactly for destinations like Athens.” Starting in early January 2026, 6E will operate six weekly non-stop flights between India and Greece. The exact configuration of the aircraft is not yet known, but it is expected to feature a two-cabin layout with Economy and IndiGoStretch seating options.

Additionally, 6E announced flights to CPH, starting 8 October 2025. The arrival of the second Boeing 787-9 in mid-September has enabled the launch of new destinations such as CPH, with LHR services also expected to begin by this October. Under the agreement with Norse Atlantic, IndiGo expects to operate four more of such aircraft in the next six months, bridging the gap until its ordered Airbus A350s arrive.

Returning to China

Before the pandemic, IndiGo operated flights to China. What is the outlook for a return?

Elbers: “We were flying to China before COVID, but of course, the entire world stopped during the pandemic. International flights, particularly to mainland China, have not yet resumed.

We’re ready to restart operations the moment both governments give the green light. While we haven’t yet announced the exact routes, once approvals are in place, IndiGo will be back in China. For now, we continue to operate to Hong Kong out of Delhi.”

With a fleet of young aircraft, 6E operates some of the efficient aircraft, which is beneficial for maintenance, customers, and emissions. The modern fleet, supplemented by a new aircraft added every week, enables the airline to adapt quickly to airspace restrictions and geopolitical changes.

Hub Strategy

IndiGo currently has multiple hubs across the country to support domestic and international growth. Some of the largest stations today are DEL, BOM, Bengaluru (BLR), and Hyderabad (HYD). Each hub supports the network differently; DEL and BOM support a large share of international traffic, including connections to Central Asia and the Middle East. There are services connecting Southeast Asian destinations, including Singapore (SIN) and Bali (DPS), from BLR. Furthermore, HYD also has some unique routes to the Middle East.

In a financial hub like Mumbai, the BOM is restricted by traffic numbers, as a new Navi Mumbai (NMI) airport is being constructed.

With Navi Mumbai International Airport under development, how does IndiGo plan to utilise this new hub?

Elbers: “It’s still early, but we’ve signed an MoU with the airport operator for a significant presence right from day one. Initially, we’ll focus on building a strong domestic network before adding international flights.

The current Mumbai airport is heavily constrained in terms of capacity, despite being the financial capital of the country. The new airport gives us the opportunity to expand, and our first priority will be to provide seamless domestic connectivity before scaling into international services.”

Introducing IndiGo Stretch

What was once a single-cabin airline with some seats offering extra legroom, 6E introduced Indigo Stretch on the 18th anniversary of the airline. It has been eight to nine months since the airline introduced the new cabin into its domestic operations.

Elbers said, “Until recently, we only had extra-legroom seats, but with India’s economic growth, we felt it was the right time to introduce a business-class product. We chose not to do a blocked-middle-seat arrangement but to offer proper seats, along with features that matter most—privacy, fast charging, and efficient service.”

“The response has been overwhelmingly positive, both domestically and now on select international routes like Bangkok and Singapore. Soon, we’ll expand it to more destinations.”, he added.

Partnerships Over Alliances

IndiGo currently has codeshares with Virgin Atlantic, Air France–KLM, Japan Airlines, and Delta. Will IndiGo be part of any future airline alliances?

Elbers: “We were initially focused on foreign airlines flying to India and then connecting on our enormous domestic network. But we start to make this relationship more reciprocal. Our flight to Amsterdam will connect on the European network with KLM, and IndiGo connects to Japan Airlines with flights from Bangkok to the destinations in Japan.

The next step is to connect to North American destinations with Virgin, Delta and KLM. Rather than alliances, we believe in building strong bilateral collaborations that give customers flexibility across different alliances at this point in time. I am optimistic that the systems will be in place before the end of the year.”

IATA AGM

6E hosted the International Air Transport Association (IATA) 81st Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Delhi, India, in 2025. Elbers reflects that the event was “a moment of pride” and had great support from the government of India.

“For many international guests, it was eye-opening to see the scale of progress in India—not just in airlines, but also airports, infrastructure, and talent. The AGM also gave us a platform to discuss global topics such as safety, operating standards, and sustainability.”, he added.

Sustainability is one of the key topics in the current aviation ecosystem. Currently, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) serves as a bridge to reduce the carbon footprint; however, it presents a challenge to produce, as less than 1% of the required fuel is currently being produced.

However, 6E also focuses on contributing to a sustainable aviation, “we operate the youngest fleet with fuel-efficient engines, we are electrifying our ground operations, and we are optimizing every aspect when it comes to fuel burn.”, Elbers commented.

Building India’s MRO Ecosystem

IndiGo is investing in a major Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) facility in Bengaluru. What’s the strategy behind this?

Elbers: “With more than 400 aircraft today, and expecting 900 in the future, IndiGo needs to build significant in-house maintenance capability.

We already have hangars in Delhi and Bengaluru handling some levels of maintenance, but this new facility will be on a much larger scale. We’ve acquired a large plot of land, and the project will generate thousands of jobs over the coming years.

India has abundant young talent, and unlike other regions facing labour shortages, we can train engineers and mechanics here to support our growth. An exact timeline cannot be confirmed at the moment, but it is expected to start sooner and finish as per our existing plan.”",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/68cd6dd83a5fb5a30bb258a6_TC-LKD%202024.jpeg,N,,2025-09-20 09:57:13.262998

With the development of next-generation jets capable of flying faster than the speed of sound, the U.S. is positioning itself as the global leader in reshaping the aviation landscape. This shift is driven by cutting-edge advancements in aerospace engineering, environmental sustainability, and noise reduction, addressing key challenges that once hindered the success of supersonic travel. By eliminating the disruptive sonic boom and enhancing fuel efficiency, these innovations promise to make high-speed travel not only feasible but also accessible on a global scale, reducing flight times drastically and transforming the way the world connects. The United States’ commitment to leading this transformation is a testament to its dedication to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in aviation, offering a glimpse of a future where long-haul flights become a thing of the past.

The Concorde was a marvel of aviation that defined the golden age of air travel. When it first took to the skies in 1969, it became an icon of speed, luxury, and technological excellence. Passengers aboard the Concorde experienced a level of service that was virtually unparalleled in the aviation world. Celebrities, business moguls, and the lucky few who managed to secure discounted tickets enjoyed gourmet meals, endless champagne, and impeccable service, all while flying across the Atlantic in under four hours—half the time it would take on a conventional airliner. It was, without question, the pinnacle of air travel.

However, despite its glory and the luxury it offered, the Concorde’s era eventually came to an end in 2003, when its fleet was retired due to rising maintenance costs, low passenger numbers, and concerns over safety. Despite this, the dream of supersonic travel has not been forgotten. In fact, efforts to revive the concept of high-speed flight have been gaining momentum in recent years. Engineers and entrepreneurs are once again racing to develop new supersonic aircraft, and the early signs of progress are promising.

One of the most notable developments in this area is the Lockheed Martin X-59, a supersonic jet being developed under NASA’s supervision. This aircraft is designed to fly at speeds up to 1.4 times the speed of sound, but with a significant difference: it produces a quiet “thump” instead of the disruptive sonic boom that has historically been a major concern for supersonic flights. The data gathered from its flights will be crucial in helping U.S. and international regulators establish new noise thresholds, which could eventually lead to the lifting of restrictions on supersonic flights over land. This breakthrough could pave the way for a resurgence in high-speed commercial travel.

At the same time, a number of startups and companies focused on aviation innovation are working to bring supersonic travel back to the commercial market. These companies are not only striving to make air travel faster, but also to make it quieter, more environmentally friendly, and more affordable. In a world where air travel has become more of a tedious chore than a pleasurable experience, the prospect of returning to the golden age of flight is something that many passengers are eagerly anticipating.

Since the Concorde’s retirement, air travel has undergone significant changes, but not necessarily for the better. Flights have become increasingly costly and less comfortable. For the average traveler, flying has become a stressful experience, characterized by delays, cramped seating, and excessive fees. For those in the elite bracket, however, there is still the option to fly in luxury with premium airlines, though at a significant cost. The general feeling among travelers is that air travel has lost much of its former glamour.

This is where a new generation of innovators is stepping in. With advancements in materials science, aerodynamics, and sustainable fuel technology, these companies are working to design supersonic aircraft that will address many of the issues that plagued the Concorde. One such company is Boom Supersonic, which aims to create a supersonic jet capable of flying at Mach 1.7—about twice the speed of today’s commercial airliners. Their aircraft, called Overture, promises to cut flight times between major cities, making long-haul travel much quicker. For example, the Overture could reduce the time it takes to fly from London to New York to just over three hours.

A key challenge that limited the Concorde’s commercial success was the 1973 ban on sonic booms over the U.S. The ban, which was initially imposed due to military aircraft concerns, meant that the Concorde could only reach supersonic speeds over the ocean, limiting its usefulness for domestic flights. This ban remained in place until 2025, when the U.S. government lifted it in an effort to encourage innovation and economic growth. With this restriction removed, the prospects for supersonic travel are greatly improved, especially for transcontinental flights. Although many countries still have similar bans, the hope is that success in the U.S. will lead to a global rethinking of sonic boom regulations.

Unlike the Concorde, which produced a loud and disruptive sonic boom, the new generation of supersonic aircraft aims to be much quieter. The Overture, for example, will utilize a technology called “Mach cutoff,” which refracts sonic waves in the atmosphere, ensuring that they do not reach the ground. As a result, passengers can expect a smooth, quiet ride without the loud noise associated with previous supersonic planes.

Boom Supersonic has already received orders for over 130 Overture aircraft from major airlines, indicating strong demand for this new generation of supersonic travel. The company’s long-term goal is to build more supersonic jets than Concorde ever did, with the aim of transforming global air travel. The Overture is expected to begin service within the next few years, and its ability to cruise at Mach 1.7 could make it a game-changer in the aviation industry.

However, the road to widespread supersonic travel is not without its obstacles. One of the most significant challenges is the environmental impact. Supersonic jets, by their nature, consume more fuel than regular aircraft. Concorde was infamous for its inefficiency, using up to two tons of fuel just to taxi on the runway. While modern companies like Boom are working to offset these emissions with sustainable aviation fuel and carbon credits, the question of how to make supersonic flight truly environmentally friendly remains unresolved.

Another potential disruption to the future of supersonic travel is the possibility of hypersonic flights—aircraft capable of traveling at speeds exceeding 3,800 mph. Hypersonic jets could revolutionize travel by drastically reducing flight times. For instance, a flight from London to Tokyo could take just a few hours, and flights from New York to Sydney could be completed in under two hours. Such speeds would make global travel more accessible and efficient than ever before.

Although hypersonic flight is still in the conceptual phase, the potential is enormous. Companies like Hyperian Aerospace are exploring the idea of a Mach 10 jet, the Hyperliner, which would use hydrogen as fuel. If realized, this could change the entire landscape of air travel, making long-haul flights a thing of the past.

The United States is leading the charge in reshaping air travel with groundbreaking supersonic technology, promising faster, more efficient, and quieter flights that will transform global connectivity and redefine long-haul travel.

While the future of supersonic and hypersonic travel is still unfolding, it is clear that the era of long-haul flights, as we know them, may soon be behind us. Advances in technology, sustainability, and regulatory changes are making faster, quieter, and more efficient travel a real possibility. As these innovations continue to evolve, the dream of returning to the speed and luxury of the Concorde era may no longer be a distant memory but a part of the future of air travel.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TTW_Makum__United_Kingdom_Leads_-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 10:56:07.793591

This marked the start of India’s transition from fossil fuel dependency to renewable energy self-reliance.
Despite these efforts, early progress in ethanol and biodiesel blending was slow.
Ethanol blending remained below 1.5% until 2014, and for diesel, it was even lower.
This was largely due to fragmented policies and a global environment where fossil fuel imports seemed easier.","India’s push for bioenergy, from converting cow dung to compressed bio-gas, highlights its evolving journey toward energy security and climate goals. The country’s tryst with bioenergy began in the 1980s with an ambitious program to turn agricultural waste—particularly cattle dung—into clean cooking gas for rural households. While environmental concerns were not the primary motivator, the initiative was visionary for its time, aiming to provide farmers with a modern, smoke-free energy alternative for cooking and lighting. The Government of India provided financial support for the installation of such units, with the goal of promoting a cleaner and healthier lifestyle.

A major leap forward came in 2003 with the launch of the Ethanol Blending Programme, which mandated up to 5% blending of ethanol in petrol in select states. The objective was to reduce the import of fossil fuels while generating renewable energy. This marked the start of India’s transition from fossil fuel dependency to renewable energy self-reliance. Initially, sugarcane by-products like molasses were used to produce ethanol. In 2005, India expanded its bioenergy vision with the Biodiesel Purchase Policy, setting an ambitious target of increasing the blending of biodiesel with diesel up to 20% by 2012. The Planning Commission’s report primarily relied on non-edible oilseeds, with Jatropha curcas identified as the most suitable tree-borne oilseed for biodiesel production. The National Mission on Biodiesel was also launched to promote its production.

Around the same time, co-generation plants in sugar mills, rice mills, and food processing industries began to flourish, saving costs, reducing emissions, and cutting fossil fuel usage. The government has been supporting the setup of these plants by providing financial assistance.

Despite these efforts, early progress in ethanol and biodiesel blending was slow. Ethanol blending remained below 1.5% until 2014, and for diesel, it was even lower. This was largely due to fragmented policies and a global environment where fossil fuel imports seemed easier. But rising oil prices and the strategic need for energy security demanded a shift. That shift arrived in 2014, when the cost of petrol saw a steep increase from INR 31 to INR 81, making it the highest in a decade.

Recognizing the urgency of a robust energy strategy, the NDA Government revitalized the biofuel sector, leading to the revolutionary National Biofuel Policy in 2018. This landmark policy expanded the feedstock base for ethanol to include sugar syrup, corn, spoiled food grains, and even used cooking oil for biodiesel. It also encouraged investment in advanced biofuels like 2G ethanol and introduced an attractive pricing mechanism, making ethanol production commercially viable. The blending target of 20% ethanol with petrol, originally set for 2030, was ambitiously advanced to 2025–26.

The same year, India launched SATAT (Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation)—a visionary scheme to set up 5,000 plants producing Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG) from agricultural residue, municipal waste, and biomass. This program aims not only to cut crude oil imports but also to create an ecosystem where waste turns into wealth, offering farmers an additional source of income while ensuring cleaner transport fuel.

Progress has been encouraging in ethanol blending, which saw remarkable growth over the past decade, while biodiesel is still facing challenges due to raw material constraints. The Jatropha crop, on which the government initially relied, did not perform as expected. Perhaps there was a huge gap between lab-grown and field-grown crops, which negatively affected yield and efficiency. The collection of used cooking oil also faced issues due to aggregation challenges and its diversion into the adulteration market. Another raw material the industry tried was palm oil. Due to volatile international prices, dependence on imports, and a lower off-take price, the industry was not successful.

The growth of CBG from 2018 to 2023 was very slow, with only 40 to 50 plants having been installed. Taking notice, the Government of India introduced several policy measures, including Market Development Assistance (MDA) for Fermented Organic Manure (FoM), the Biomass Aggregation Machinery (BAM) Scheme, the Direct Pipeline Injection (DPI) Scheme, and Central Financial Assistance (CFA). These policies gave a little push to the industry, and now we have about 120 plants already commissioned in the country, with another 200 to 300 in various stages of construction.

Another promising development is the use of densified biomass in boilers, particularly in the power sector. The Ministry of Power set a target of blending 5% biomass with coal in thermal power plants. To facilitate this, the Sustainable Agrarian Mission on use of Agri-Residue in Thermal Power Plants (SAMARTH) was set up to create an ecosystem that can help with off-take. Price benchmarking was also introduced, which helped bring positive momentum to the sector.

Looking ahead, India is also investing in futuristic avenues like 2G ethanol, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and biomaterials. These will play a crucial role in meeting India’s bold climate commitments: achieving net-zero by 2070, 500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy capacity by 2030, and a 45% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030.

The government’s intent is clear, but unlocking the sector’s full potential requires scaling up support and creating a stable ecosystem. The way forward is a broad-based, sustained approach rather than fragmented efforts. Key enablers will be:

• A price-gap support mechanism, ensuring fair returns for producers while keeping fuel affordable.

• A central climate and carbon reduction fund, supported by a cess on fossil fuels, to finance bioenergy growth.

• Mandates and policy certainty to attract long-term private investments.",https://eng.ruralvoice.in/uploads/images/2025/09/image_750x500_68ce828c8b85e.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 10:56:15.826215

Conclusion: The Future of Supersonic Travel The return of supersonic flight promises to reshape the way we think about air travel.","(This Image is AI Generated)

In an exciting development for the future of air travel, the Boom Supersonic jet is set to redefine long-haul flights, potentially cutting the travel time between the UK and the US by half. Drawing inspiration from the iconic Concorde, which captured the imagination of luxury travelers in the 20th century, this new supersonic aircraft promises to deliver not only faster flights but also a quieter, more sustainable approach to air travel.

The Boom Overture is designed to fly at Mach 1.7, almost twice the speed of today’s commercial airliners, drastically reducing the time it takes to cross the Atlantic. Passengers can expect to travel from London to New York in just under three and a half hours—a welcome development for business travelers and tourists looking to minimize time spent in the air.

With 130 aircraft orders already secured from major airlines, the Overture could be the next step in the evolution of aviation. The promise of faster and more efficient travel is something both business travelers and leisure tourists are eagerly anticipating.

Why Supersonic Flights Are Making a Comeback

When Concorde was retired in 2003, the world lost one of the most glamorous symbols of aviation, beloved for its speed, luxury, and prestige. The retirement of Concorde marked the end of an era of supersonic flight for commercial passengers. However, nearly two decades later, supersonic travel is once again on the brink of making a comeback, this time with a focus on sustainability and lower noise emissions.

The Lockheed Martin X-59, developed by NASA, is already undergoing flight tests and is designed to fly at 1.4 times the speed of sound with minimal noise—thanks to a unique design that eliminates the loud sonic boom. This groundbreaking technology will play a significant role in opening up the skies to faster travel once again, especially across continents where flight times can take up to 12 hours.

While Concorde was restricted in the US due to noise concerns, Boom Supersonic aims to address this by introducing a much quieter “thump” at takeoff and landing, allowing the plane to operate over land, which was previously restricted by the sonic boom ban. This development could make supersonic travel a practical reality for global travel once again.

The Role of Blake Scholl and Boom Supersonic

Leading the charge in the new wave of supersonic travel is Blake Scholl, a tech entrepreneur who founded Boom Supersonic. Scholl, who is passionate about aviation and was inspired by Concorde’s legacy, has built a company that is focused not only on speed but also on environmental sustainability. His vision for Boom Supersonic includes using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the aircraft, aiming to cut carbon emissions in the aviation sector.

Despite facing skepticism from some corners of the aviation industry, Scholl and his team have already proven their technological capabilities. The XB-1, a prototype of the Overture, has broken the sound barrier six times without creating an audible sonic boom, signaling a significant milestone in the journey toward commercial supersonic flight.

Environmental and Economic Considerations

One of the key challenges with supersonic flight has always been its environmental impact. Concorde was known for its high fuel consumption, and its emissions were a major concern. However, the new generation of supersonic jets is being designed with more sustainable practices in mind. Boom Supersonic is working on creating a Symphony engine that is compatible with 100% sustainable aviation fuel, addressing some of the environmental issues that plagued earlier supersonic models.

From an economic standpoint, supersonic travel could become an exclusive offering for premium travelers, as the tickets for these flights are expected to resemble first-class and business-class prices. However, with growing competition and advancements in technology, prices may eventually decrease, making supersonic flights accessible to more travelers.

The Impact on Business and Leisure Travelers

For business travelers, the ability to cut down travel times significantly could be a game-changer. The potential for quick trips across the Atlantic will allow professionals to attend meetings, conferences, or other important engagements without spending a full day or more traveling. This will not only save time but also increase productivity for global companies.

Leisure travelers will also benefit, as the Overture will make long-haul flights more manageable and enjoyable. For tourists looking to visit places like New York, Los Angeles, or even Tokyo, supersonic travel could open up new opportunities for exploration, allowing travelers to experience more in a shorter amount of time.

Fares and Accessibility: What to Expect

While the exact fares for Boom Supersonic’s Overture remain undisclosed, the company has stated that their design will make the aircraft profitable for airlines. The goal is to make supersonic flights available at fares comparable to first-class or business-class tickets on today’s commercial jets.

Though the cost of supersonic flight may remain high initially, it’s expected that as the technology improves and more airlines join the market, the fares could become more competitive, allowing a wider range of travelers to experience the speed and luxury of supersonic air travel.

The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities

As with any cutting-edge technology, Boom Supersonic faces several challenges. One of the biggest hurdles is the fuel efficiency of the aircraft, as supersonic jets typically consume more fuel than subsonic aircraft. Additionally, there are concerns about whether the new supersonic jets will be able to operate efficiently on long-haul flights, especially trans-Pacific routes that may require a refueling stop.

Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of supersonic travel—speed, comfort, and sustainability—make it an exciting prospect for the future of aviation. With airlines already placing orders for 130 Overture jets, the future of supersonic air travel looks promising.

Conclusion: The Future of Supersonic Travel

The return of supersonic flight promises to reshape the way we think about air travel. With advancements in sustainable aviation fuel, lower noise emissions, and faster flight times, the dream of Concorde-style travel may soon become a reality for all. Whether for business or leisure, the ability to travel across the Atlantic in under four hours could revolutionize the travel industry and make long-haul flights more efficient and enjoyable than ever before.

Key Points:

Boom Supersonic aims to revive supersonic air travel with the Overture jet, cruising at Mach 1.7—almost twice the speed of conventional airliners.

The $100,000 fee per H-1B applicant could impact global workforce mobility .

The Overture will use sustainable aviation fuel, addressing environmental concerns associated with supersonic travel.

With orders from 130 airlines, the Overture could reshape the way travelers experience long-haul flights.

As Skor recounted, Growth Energy is the largest biofuel trade association in the country, with a network of 130 companies, including John Deere and BASF, and nearly 100 biorefineries, such as ADM, Cargill, and POET.
Biofuels have emerged as a point of alignment between the Trump administration and the clean energy industry.
“So there’s a very strong connection to some of the real big priorities that are really important to this administration,” Skor explained.

As Skor recounted, Growth Energy is the largest biofuel trade association in the country, with a network of 130 companies, including John Deere and BASF, and nearly 100 biorefineries, such as ADM, Cargill, and POET. These operations span 33 states, with a particular presence in the Midwest. “We are really the engine of the rural economy,” Skor said. “It goes back to the fact that we help keep small communities going and thriving.”

The conversation emphasized the enduring popularity and legislative success of biofuels in the U.S., with the industry offering value to both political parties. On the one hand, they provide low-carbon energy and decarbonized modes of transportation. On the other, they produce affordable and accessible fuel, contributing to both energy independence and dominance. This bipartisan support was most evident in the budget reconciliation bill that was signed into law earlier this year. Although it cut $545 billion in tax credits that originated in the prior administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, Congress extended and even enhanced the technology-neutral clean fuel production credit, Section 45Z.

Biofuels have emerged as a point of alignment between the Trump administration and the clean energy industry. For example, during President Trump’s first term, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) increased access to higher blends of ethanol. In this term, the president issued an executive order on day one directing the EPA to consider higher-ethanol blend E15. “So there’s a very strong connection to some of the real big priorities that are really important to this administration,” Skor explained.

Skor stated that this support stems from both the President’s loyalty to the U.S. farmer and his emphasis on ‘America First.’ “The administration is making these announcements through the framework of US agriculture and maintaining strong biofuel demand,” she summarized.

Meanwhile, the industry is seeing significant opportunities arise in both the short and long term. On the near horizon, argued Skor, the continued use of ethanol in cars and trucks in the U.S. and abroad is a particular highlight. Domestically, this has recently been spurred by the highest-volume requirements ever proposed by the EPA under the Renewable Fuel Standard. Even California, until now the last state to cap the amount of ethanol that can be blended with gasoline at 10 percent, saw its Senate vote unanimously to allow the sale of E15. Internationally, Canada, Brazil, India, Japan, and Vietnam are also increasing their goals and standards regarding ethanol, providing a market opportunity.

In the longer term, meanwhile, Skor pointed out that a significant amount of innovation is emerging in this space. For example, sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to transform the aviation industry. At the same time, ethanol can replace bunker fuel in the maritime sector and replace diesel in long-haul trucking. In these nascent markets, Skor commented, “We still have to be able to do, for some of them, proof of concept. We’ve got to get regulations in place. We’ve got to be able to produce a commercial scale and get the economics in line. But that’s the blue sky potential.” As these technologies further decarbonize through carbon capture, the application of climate-smart agricultural techniques, and the installation of more clean energy sources, the carbon intensity of these fuels will also continue to decrease.",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/549877374_1227743092726280_3947920055023475192_n-1-e1758291202320.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 03:56:07.268643

Initially, the company will import SAF to meet immediate demand. A medium-term plan focuses on establishing a local production facility, while the long-term goal is full-scale local production to enhance energy security, reduce imports, and create green jobs.

The company has already completed feasibility and engineering studies for a dedicated SAF plant in the UAE. In the meantime, it is collaborating with international facilities to expand its bio-based product portfolio.

Lootah Biofuels’ SAF is produced from used cooking oil (UCO) and waste-derived fats, meeting ASTM D7566-24 and ICAO CORSIA standards. Compared with conventional jet fuel, it can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% and can be blended with Jet A-1 at ratios of up to 50% delivering cleaner combustion with ultra-low sulfur content.

Yousif Lootah, CEO of Lootah Biofuels, said: “As one of the first local suppliers of SAF, we are proud to launch SAF in the UAE market and showcase it at Dubai Airshow to local and international stakeholders and leading companies in the aviation industry.”

The move aligns with the UAE’s Net Zero 2050 strategy, with both Emirates and Etihad actively deploying SAF. Emirates has secured over 3 million gallons of blended SAF from Neste for 2024 and 2025, alongside 3,000 metric tonnes of neat SAF supplied by Shell Aviation at London Heathrow.

Etihad has invested in SAF development for more than a decade and leads the Boeing Greenliner Programme, accelerating aviation sustainability initiatives.

The initiative has also been highlighted by Mohammed Alrayees, Head of Strategy at Dubai Municipality, who welcomed the community effort as part of Dubai’s broader sustainable urban strategy.

During Fakhruddin Properties 90:90 milestone event earlier this month, Alrayees said that the Dubai Municipality, through the Waste Strategy and Project Department, is “proud to lead a transformative journey in the waste management sector”.

The 42nd International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly will convene in Montreal, Canada from September 23 to October 3, 2025, under the theme “Safe Skies, Sustainable Future.” Yet despite being a critical hub in global aviation, Taiwan remains excluded from ICAO—a gap that creates unnecessary risks in international air safety and undermines the very mission of the organization.

Taipei FIR: A Critical Link in Global Aviation

The Taipei Flight Information Region (FIR) is one of the busiest in the world. In 2024 alone, it managed over 1.6 million flights and served 70 million passengers, seamlessly connecting Northeast and Southeast Asia. Taiwan not only upholds ICAO standards but also leads in advancing sustainable practices such as carbon-offset programs and the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). These measures directly contribute to reducing aviation emissions and achieving ICAO’s long-term vision of safe, secure, and sustainable skies.

Shared Stakes for the Philippines and Beyond

The safety implications go well beyond Taiwan. The Taipei FIR borders four others—Fukuoka, Manila, Hong Kong, and Shanghai—placing it at the crossroads of major international routes between China, Japan, and the Philippines.

For the Philippines, the connection is especially personal. Nearly half a million Filipinos visited Taiwan in 2024, a figure projected to surpass 600,000 in 2025. More than 200,000 overseas Filipino workers and residents currently live in Taiwan. Ensuring the safety of flights between the Philippines and Taiwan is therefore not just a matter of policy, but one that directly affects countless Filipino families and communities.

International Calls for Inclusion

Global leaders are increasingly voicing concern over Taiwan’s exclusion. In Canada’s House of Commons, Conservative MP Michael Cooper urged ICAO to “stop placating the Beijing dictatorship, put global aviation safety first, and invite Taiwan to participate.” He stressed that excluding “one of the largest and most responsible airspace managers creates a dangerous gap that undermines global aviation safety, and makes a mockery of ICAO’s stated mission.”

Liberal MP Judy Sgro, Chair of the Canadian-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group, likewise reinforced the call, underscoring that Taiwan’s participation is essential to strengthening international aviation cooperation.

Safety Must Come Before Politics

Their messages are clear: granting Taiwan access to ICAO deliberations is not a political maneuver—it is a global safety imperative. Aviation knows no borders. Excluding Taiwan weakens the very system designed to protect international travelers.

With more than three-quarters of a million Filipinos relying on safe, direct air travel to and from Taiwan, the stakes are especially high for our region. The world cannot afford to look away. ICAO must invite Taiwan to the table—for the sake of safe skies, for the security of travelers, and for a sustainable aviation future.

Kawasaki Motors, famed for its roaring motorcycles, is taking a surprising new road – into the skies.

The Japanese manufacturer has signed a strategic partnership with Bulgarian drone-maker Dronamics to bring its engine expertise to the Black Swan, a revolutionary unmanned cargo aircraft.

What seems like a leap from superbikes to drones is in fact a natural progression for a brand with aviation in its DNA. Kawasaki’s first motorcycle engines were designed using aircraft know-how, and now the company is circling back to its roots with a renewed focus on aviation propulsion systems.

Kawasaki and Dronamics partnership in aviation propulsion

The agreement, announced in Hyogo and Sofia on 18 September, places Dronamics among Kawasaki’s strategic partners for aero piston engines.

Together, the two firms will develop, test and integrate Kawasaki’s new propulsion systems into the Black Swan cargo drone. The partnership covers the entire lifecycle of aviation engine development, from R&D to flight validation.

For Dronamics, it represents a major endorsement from a global engineering powerhouse. For Kawasaki, it offers a chance to bring its decades of combustion engine mastery into a fast-growing market where unmanned cargo aviation promises to reshape logistics.

The Black Swan cargo drone

At the heart of the collaboration is the Black Swan, a new class of cargo aircraft designed purely for freight rather than passengers.

Key specifications include:

Payload: up to 350 kilograms – about the load of a small delivery van

Range: 2,500 kilometres

Runways: capable of taking off from short or unpaved strips

This makes the drone well-suited to connecting remote or underserved areas, providing the speed of air freight at a fraction of the cost. Dronamics claims the Black Swan delivers cargo up to 80% faster and 50% cheaper than traditional methods, with lower emissions.

Potential applications span e-commerce, emergency resupply, disaster relief, and even firefighting. With its carbon-fibre structure already sourced from Japan, Kawasaki’s involvement raises the prospect of a fully Japan-built Black Swan.

Shared vision for sustainable cargo aviation

Both companies place sustainability at the centre of their plans. The Black Swan can operate on 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), while Kawasaki is developing new propulsion systems designed to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

Konstantin Rangelov, Co-Founder and CTO of Dronamics, called the partnership “a significant step forward in unmanned aviation technology,” adding, “The fact that Kawasaki has chosen our platform for their renewed focus on propulsion is a true honour.”

Kawasaki described the agreement as a milestone in its aerospace ambitions. Hiroshi Tomomori, Managing Executive Officer, said, “By combining our long expertise in engine development with Dronamics’ pioneering UAV technology, we aim to deliver propulsion systems that redefine performance and sustainability.”

Unlocking the “missing middle mile”

The Black Swan cargo drone is designed to fill what logistics experts call the “missing middle mile” – the gap between long-haul transport and last-mile delivery.

By making same-day air freight affordable, it could link towns, islands and inland factories in ways that were once unthinkable. With Kawasaki’s propulsion systems, the partnership is betting on a future where cargo flights become as routine as motorbikes on the road.

Could other motorcycle makers follow Kawasaki into drones?

Kawasaki may not be the last Japanese motorcycle manufacturer to look skyward. Analysts suggest rivals such as Yamaha and Suzuki – which already have capabilities in robotics, marine engines and experimental aviation – could explore similar moves into unmanned flight.

Like Kawasaki, both brands have long expertise in high-performance combustion engines and face pressure to diversify as electrification reshapes the motorcycle market. Pivoting towards aviation propulsion or drone technology would allow them to repurpose decades of R&D while tapping into a booming logistics sector hungry for innovation.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Dronamics-Black-Swan_5-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 01:57:06.714371

ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.","LOS ANGELES and CARLSBAD, Calif., Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, and Qualigen Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: QLGN) (""QLGN""), jointly announced that they have entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Agreement”) for a private investment in public equity (PIPE) in QLGN’s common stock and preferred stock, and will start a crypto and web3-related business.

Upon completion of the required stockholder approval process, it is expected that QLGN will rebrand as CXC10, fully focusing on its three growth engines in crypto and ecosystem buildup for Web3.

The PIPE financing is being led by Faraday Future and its Founder and Global Co-CEO YT Jia, together with other investors including SIGN Foundation, a blockchain technology company backed by Binance Labs, Sequoia Capital (US, India, China), IDG, and Circle, building software infrastructure for governments and the next generation of capital markets. The total financing is approximately $41 million. Jerry Wang, the President of FF, also participated in this financing.

Under the terms of the Agreement, Faraday Future has agreed, subject to closing conditions, to invest approximately $30 million in QLGN at an effective price of $2.246 per share, representing beneficial ownership of approximately 55% of QLGN’s outstanding common stock. In addition, YT Jia intends to personally invest approximately $4 million, representing ownership of about 7% of QLGN’s common stock. As a cornerstone investor, YT Jia has also agreed to a two-year voluntary lock-up on his personal investment. QLGN already obtained majority shareholder support of this transaction via voting support agreement.

At the closing of this transaction, YT Jia will serve as a Chief Advisor of QLGN, Jerry Wang will be appointed as Co-CEO of QLGN, and FF CFO Koti Meka will be appointed as CFO. FF will also have the right to nominate two of the five independent directors. If the proposal is approved at the stockholders’ meeting, FF's nomination rights could increase to four of the seven seats. FF will also have participation rights as to QLGN’s future financing.

Following completion of the PIPE, Faraday Future and its Founder and Global Co-CEO YT Jia are expected to beneficially own over 62% of QLGN’s outstanding common stock, based on shares outstanding as of the pricing date, giving pro forma effect to the transaction.

Given the energy density limitations of today’s aviation batteries, zero-emission flight is expected to come at the expense of range and capacity. But according to Daniel Rosen Jacobson, cofounder, co-CEO, and chief business officer of Elysian Aviation, it doesn’t have to be that way.

“Because of the weight of the battery and the low energy density of batteries, what you need to do is actually build a bigger plane,” Jacobson told FLYING at the Paris Air Show in June.

Most electric models are destined for short-hop flights and a handful of passengers. Think electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxis like Archer Aviation’s Midnight or Joby Aviation’s S4, both intended for a maximum of four travelers and trips under 100 nm. Even hybrid-electric designs, such as Electra’s EL9 or Heart Aerospace’s ES-30, are expected to max out at about 30 passengers despite improvements in range.

But Elysian’s E9X—its concept for a full-electric, zero-emission regional airliner—is being developed for as many as 90 passengers. Jacobson predicted it will have a range of about 800 kilometers (432 nm) at launch, targeted for early next decade.

“It is essentially a bigger is better concept,” he said. “Because if you can build a plane that is truly zero emission, that can already fly a significant range without any major battery improvements…then having a larger plane has a better business case.”

Jacobson believes the E9X will one day be a staple of large airline fleets. He envisions it flying regional routes under 1,000 km (540 nm) that are occupied by turboprops or even narrowbody models. Per Jacobson, these account for about half of the world’s flights, though some estimates place that share even higher. Already, Elysian is working with Dutch flag carrier KLM and subsidiary Transavia to turn its vision into reality.

“At go to market, it’ll be likely that an airline will incorporate this where they currently fly turboprops or regional jets,” Jacobson said. “But the fact that it will likely be already close to, or even already competitive with, the narrowbodies means that in their network they can be quite flexible.”

Bigger Is Better

Building a large electric aircraft may seem counterintuitive given the inherent limitations of batteries. But Jacobson believes the industry is looking at it from the wrong angle.

“Most academics have said, ‘If we want to electrify aircraft—we take an efficient plane, a turboprop of today, and we try to electrify it—what happens is the weight becomes a huge blocking factor, and your range is too limited because of the weight of the batteries,’” he said. “But you shouldn’t look at aircraft like that. Because [turboprops] are designed to carry the least amount of fuel possible, or at least be very efficient with fuel.”

Jacobson and Elysian cofounder Rob Wolleswinkel, who spends his weekends flying for a small Dutch airline, instead looked to the past, when aircraft like the Boeing 707 or B-52 carried tens or even hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel.

“Their energy weight was much higher in ratio than their other types of weight, their structural and their pedal weight,” Jacobson said. “And that is what is applied here [with the E9X].”

After that “lightbulb moment,” Elysian commissioned a study with Delft University of Technology, a few miles from its headquarters in the Netherlands, to study the feasibility of a larger electric model. Researchers found that with a low enough structural weight, such a design could fly farther than previously thought.

According to Jacobson, Elysian’s clean-sheet design will weigh about 75 tons, in the neighborhood of the 707 and B-52. But much of that weight comes from batteries, which will be stored within an approximately 138-foot wing—wider than the Boeing 737. The batteries are intended to power eight electric engines and propellers, with a gas turbine-based reserve system for emergency power.

Elysian believes the configuration could achieve a range of 500 km with existing battery technology. However, Jacobson said that if battery energy density reaches 300 watt-hours per kilogram—at the high end of lithium-ion batteries for electric cars—the E9X could reach 800 km.

Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, meanwhile, contend that regional electric planes will need to hit 1,000 watt-hours per kilogram to be viable.

“We are totally dependent on where the battery technology will go,” Jacobson said.

To mitigate that, the plan is for airlines and operators will swap out the batteries when they degrade below about 90 percent in quality.

“That means that at every battery swap, there is an opportunity to swap in slightly better battery cells into the pack,” he said. “And so our idea is, every couple of years, an airline can upgrade the battery cells in their battery pack and increase their range.”

Despite being more of a “moon-shot project,” the E9X could integrate more seamlessly with large airlines—or corporate or aerial tourism operators—than eVTOL and other smaller electric models. A second study Elysian commissioned with consultancy CE Delft found its efficiency on short-haul routes could surpass hydrogen or even sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Jacobson said those technologies will be “part of the solution, but not the entire solution.”

Decarbonization is an obvious draw.

“But why it’s really a no-brainer is the cost profile,” Jacobson said. “It’s the fact that batteries get cheaper and cheaper and cheaper. Fuel for now is getting more expensive because of SAF cost and supply.”

Elysian projects the E9X will be cost competitive with existing turboprops and narrowbodies, assuming energy costs double due to SAF or European Union emissions trading scheme (ETS) mandates. The company is working with KLM to validate its economic model.

The Runway

It could be years or even a decade before the E9X enters service. However, Elysian is collaborating with a few key partners to hit its early 2030s target. Jacobson said the company has already begun working with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to certify to the regulator’s CS-25 standard for large aircraft, with plans to involve the FAA at a later stage. It is progressing toward EASA design organization approval (DOA), which would allow it to begin building aircraft.

Aiding those efforts is sister company Fokker Services Group, an OEM that also offers a full suite of aftermarket services from parts supply to MRO. Elysian and Fokker engineers share an office and collaborate frequently, Jacobson said.

In addition, both companies were spun out of Panta Holdings, which in 2022 sold AvCorp Industries—a supplier of major structures for Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Bombardier, and others—to France’s Latecoere.

“We’ve been able to benefit from people who have certified aircraft, who have a lot of experience,” Jacobson said.

Jacobson said there is still work to be done on the regulatory side. Elysian and a few other startups, for example, are in discussions with the European Commission to modify weight-based airport charges.

“If you’re going to be charged on the basis of MTOW, that is not a level playing field,” Jacobson said. “That means a kerosene plane will be massively advantageous in terms of cost.”

Still, he said, “we do feel that…there is an increased desire for the aerospace sector and startups within that to be successful, to stay in Europe.”

Post-certification, Jacobson expects Fokker to serve as an MRO partner. He envisions pilots being able to add an E9X type rating to their commercial certificate. And already, Elysian is soliciting their feedback.

“We find it very important that pilots can give feedback on this aircraft early on,” Jacobson said.

The company in July launched a workshop with current and former KLM and Transavia pilots, many of whom have experience on turboprops and narrowbodies. It asked them how the E9X may compare in terms of earning potential and gauged their level of comfort with electric propulsion and certain operational quirks, such as a steeper-than-typical takeoff. Elysian does not yet have a cockpit mockup but is using virtual reality technology to simulate the experience.

“For now, it’s really more of a conceptual exercise,” Jacobson said. “Our plan is to kind of evolve it into getting more and more physical in terms of the hardware that we create.”

Jacobson said Elysian and KLM are planning about eight more workshops in 2025, each with a different focus. An initial workshop in June, for example, centered around passenger experience. Future sessions could involve network planning and aircraft maintenance.

Over the course of the multiyear partnership, the companies will study aircraft specifications, pilot controls, operational profiles, and other aspects to ensure the E9X fits within current and future KLM networks. Pilots will also have a say in the concept’s direction.

“It’s really about making sure that pilots understand and feel comfortable with the operation, so we’re not making big mistakes from the pilot point of view,” Jacobson said.

“Broadly, I’d say the investor base reflects the sort of opportunity set that we’re seeing for the fund,” Archer said.
As for returns, it targets a slightly higher return than typical MAM renewables funds, eyeing a 13-15 percent net IRR, Infrastructure Investor previously reported.
“I think one thing to note with this fund is it’s very much focused on growing businesses and growth is quite capital-intensive.
Then you’ve got last-mile delivery and logistics businesses that are going electric, so that business is really exciting,” Archer said.","Macquarie Asset Management announced a final close of the Macquarie Green Energy Transition Solutions (MGETS) fund on Friday.

The fund launched in 2022 and, despite a challenging fundraising environment for the first year, closed above its initial target of $2 billion at $2.4 billion, while also raising co-investment commitments of $647 million. It had raised about $1.7 billion by October 2023.

Chris Archer, executive director of MAM Green Investments, told Infrastructure Investor that minimum LP investments were $5 million, and LPs include a diverse set of investors ranging from family offices to pensions, universities, insurers, and sovereign wealth funds.

Archer emphasised that the fund is truly global in scope.

“Broadly, I’d say the investor base reflects the sort of opportunity set that we’re seeing for the fund,” Archer said. “We’re about 40 percent North American, 40 percent European and 20 percent APAC and Middle East investors, which sort of reflects our original target for deployment. And we are quite close to that in terms of overall exposure in the funds.”

MGETS has an emphasis on technologies outside of the traditional renewables, like solar and wind. Archer held up Dutch sustainable aviation fuel business SkyNRG, European and APAC-based battery storage company Eku Energy, distributed energy businesses and battery manufacturers like France’s Verkor as particularly exciting examples of the 12 already closed investments.

As for returns, it targets a slightly higher return than typical MAM renewables funds, eyeing a 13-15 percent net IRR, Infrastructure Investor previously reported.

“In terms of deal size, there’s a big range,” Archer said. “I think one thing to note with this fund is it’s very much focused on growing businesses and growth is quite capital-intensive. We tend to ultimately have a target where your average deal size will end up at about 10 percent of the fund size.”

Of the $405 million, or 65 percent, of the funds already committed, Archer called the $133 million for Vertelo, a business leasing battery electric buses in India, one of the most compelling.

“The stats are just incredible. There are 2 million buses on the road in India, and that’s growing [about] 10 percent a year. About half of those are publicly-owned, and all of the replacements for those will be electric. Many of the private operators are going electric. Then you’ve got last-mile delivery and logistics businesses that are going electric, so that business is really exciting,” Archer said.

“We were seeing an opportunity to grow businesses deploying proven technology into the new sectors for the next wave of opportunities within global decarbonisation. We saw the beginning of this decade as an opportunity for a number of those technologies to ramp up,” Archer added.

“The idea is to be doing that with an infrastructure mindset, focusing on building sustainment infrastructure, focusing on the kind of contracted profile of those assets and building on what we’ve been doing in our background in infrastructure for mature renewables products.”

While the energy transition has faced new challenges in some markets, particularly the US, where a rapidly changing regulatory regime is actively working to promote fossil fuels over renewables in the midst of rising energy demand, Archer indicated that the fund has stayed on mission since its 2022 launch.

“We started developing the strategy before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed,” Archer said, noting that there have been some changes in priorities among some investors. “But even in the US, the positioning we’re in today across many of these sectors in terms of support, the outlook is probably better than it was in 2022, in many ways.”",https://media.infrastructureinvestor.com/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1436063733.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 18:56:17.335423

It is a technology that is still at an earlier stage of maturity but delivers significant decarbonization,” Ms. Borges said.","From 2024 to 2025, the number of announced projects for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Brazil jumped from three to nine, according to the Energy Research Office (EPE). Production of SAF at a commercial scale, which has yet to begin in the country, is projected to reach 2.8 billion liters by 2035, boosted in part by the National Sustainable Aviation Fuel Program (ProBioQAV), established in October 2024.

The term SAF refers to a range of fuels whose chemical composition is similar to that of aviation kerosene (QAV), but which are produced from renewable resources such as biomass, vegetable oils, and animal fats. This similarity allows the use of these biofuels in aircraft without any need to modify engines, while cutting carbon emissions by between 55% and 90% compared with petroleum-based fuels. Using SAF blended with conventional QAV is considered the most effective immediate alternative for the energy transition in air transport. For technical reasons, the electrification of large aircraft remains uncertain.

In shipping, the reduction of the carbon footprint has begun with the addition of biodiesel or renewable diesel—also known as HVO—to bunker fuel or marine diesel oil. Compared with conventional diesel, biodiesel and HVO can cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 80% and 90%, respectively. Brazil has the potential to expand biodiesel production from the current 10.1 billion liters to 13.9 billion liters by 2035, according to the EPE. HVO is not yet produced commercially in the country, but projects are underway.

One such project is being developed by Acelen Renováveis, which plans to produce SAF and HVO from macaúba oil—derived from a native palm—starting in 2030. A biorefinery with the capacity to produce 1 billion liters of biofuels per year is set to begin construction next year in São Francisco do Conde, Bahia. It will be the first of five plants that Mubadala Capital, the sovereign wealth fund of the United Arab Emirates and the controlling shareholder of the company, intends to build in Brazil. The unit is expected to begin operating in 2028 using vegetable oils, including recycled cooking oil, and non-edible animal fats.

The bet on macaúba stems from the plant’s productivity: it can yield seven to ten times more oil per cultivated hectare compared with soybeans, explained Luiz de Mendonça, chief executive of Acelen. “We see macaúba as a very competitive fruit. We will have a production cost comparable to that of fossil fuel once the supply chain reaches full maturity,” Mr. de Mendonça said.

Acelen’s $3 billion project aims to establish an integrated biofuel production unit. To that end, the company created a research and development program dedicated to macaúba and set up a technological innovation park in the municipality of Montes Claros, in Minas Gerais, with the capacity to produce 10.5 million palm seedlings per year.

Partnerships

The company also launched a partnership program with small and medium-sized producers and family farmers for the cultivation of macaúba. The plan is for 20% of the fruit used in the production of SAF and HVO to be purchased from these partners. Full implementation of the project is expected to generate up to 85,000 direct and indirect jobs and move around $40 billion over the next decade, according to a study by the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV).

At Petrobras, SAF will begin to be produced on a commercial scale in the coming months, with capacity of up to 10,000 barrels per day. In production tests at the Duque de Caxias Refinery in Rio de Janeiro, a mixture of conventional QAV with up to 1.2% corn oil was made.

For the shipping sector, Petrobras began selling bunker fuel with 24% second- or third-generation biodiesel—that is, produced from treated waste such as cooking oil, industrial oil, and animal fats—in July of last year. The blend, dubbed VLS B24, had been tested in 2023 in the company’s own Transpetro fleet, supplied at the Rio Grande terminal in Rio Grande do Sul.

Compared with 100% fossil-based bunker fuel, the renewable blend reduces carbon emissions by about 20%, depending on the raw material. VLS B24 is sold in Brazil and in Singapore.

The company plans to invest $1.5 billion in its refineries by 2029 for the development of bioproducts and sustainable fuels. The business plan includes the installation of a unit for the production of HVO and BioQAV (a blend used to make SAF) at the Presidente Bernardes Refinery in Cubatão, São Paulo. The unit will have a capacity of 15,000 barrels per day. Another, larger plant is planned for the Boaventura Energy Complex in Itaboraí, Rio de Janeiro, with daily production capacity of 19,000 barrels.

With no domestic production of SAF yet, the domestic market has been supplied by imports. Earlier this year, Vibra acquired 550,000 liters from an Asian supplier and, since April, has been making it available for commercial and executive aviation at Galeão and Jacarepaguá airports in Rio de Janeiro, in a blend of 90% conventional QAV and 10 percent SAF.

“We were pioneers in importing the product and fostering the SAF market in Brazil. We intend to make it available at other airports, with the expectation that demand will grow,” said Marcelo Bragança, Vibra’s vice president of operations, logistics, and sourcing.

This year, Vibra also began selling marine diesel with 20% biodiesel added. Sales are in a testing phase with two clients operating maritime support equipment, such as tugboats at the Port of Santos. Results indicate that the blend can be used safely and reduces carbon emissions by 86%.

The growing demand for sustainable fuels in aviation and shipping is tied to the evolution of decarbonization mandates. Currently, both air and maritime transport each account for about 3% of global carbon emissions.

Last year, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established that net carbon emissions from international flights cannot exceed 85% of 2019 levels. The goal is to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 through the use of SAF as well as technological and operational improvements.

Fuel of the future

In Brazil, the Fuel of the Future Act created a mandate requiring airline operators to adopt SAF in order to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions on domestic flights. The minimum percentages for emissions reduction start at 1% in 2027 and rise to 10% by 2037.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has also set sustainability targets. According to its timeline, total carbon emissions must be progressively reduced until they reach net neutrality in 2050. Green fuels are expected to represent at least 5% of the energy used by vessels by 2030.

For Maria Netto, executive director of the Climate and Society Institute (iCS), the debate on decarbonizing air and maritime transport at COP30 should focus on technological innovations and their importance for the climate agenda. “There is an ongoing discussion about technologies, and Brazil has great potential to provide solutions to both domestic and international markets. It is important to show the progress already achieved,” Ms. Netto said.

The conference will also provide another opportunity for Brazil’s industry to counter the idea that biofuel production competes with food production. In addition to having abundant land for cultivation, Brazil has mastered agricultural techniques for crop integration that increase productivity and give the country an advantage in the global market.

According to Ms. Netto, for Brazil to turn these advantages into competitiveness, it must prove the sustainability of biofuels through an efficient traceability system. But that comes at a high cost, and uncertainties around obtaining international certification have stalled some investments, said Camilo Adas, a researcher, member of the SAE Brazil Council, and leader of the Ministry of Development, Industry and Trade’s working group on decarbonizing the naval industry. “Within Brazil, there is regulatory stability, but more predictability is needed at the global level,” Mr. Adas said.

Last year, a public call issued by BNDES and Finep to select business plans for sustainable fuel production received 43 proposals focused on SAF and 33 on fuels for shipping, with a potential investment of R$167 billion. Of those, 42 proposals were approved, with potential investment of R$130 billion.

José Luis Pinho Leite Gordon, director of productive development, innovation, and foreign trade at BNDES, said the development bank is currently discussing business plans with the selected companies in order to mitigate regulatory and financial risks. The call for proposals stipulates that R$6 billion will be made available for the winning projects.

“There is indeed uncertainty regarding regulatory issues, as well as geopolitical tensions that can shift priorities in the environmental agenda and the direction of investments,” he said. “This makes companies rethink their strategies. The production of SAF requires high investment per plant—up to $1 billion—and carries risks. We are bringing together players across the supply chain to work jointly and discussing partnerships aimed at sharing risks.”

Among the proposals approved by BNDES is one from Prumo Logística, the company behind the development of the Port of Açu in São João da Barra, northern Rio de Janeiro state. The company signed an agreement with Repsol Sinopec Brasil (RSB) to conduct studies on technologies capable of converting CO2 captured from the air into lower-carbon fuel for airplanes and ships.

The pilot plant of the program, managed by RSB, will have the capacity to produce about 300 liters of sustainable fuel per day and will be built at the innovation hub licensed by the port. Green hydrogen, SAF, biomass derivatives, and e-fuels—such as green ammonia and e-methanol—are among the solutions under development.

Given the potential of these products, the Port of Açu decided to get ahead of demand and invested in securing preliminary environmental permits for project installations, even before attracting companies. The first licensed area, covering 1 million square meters, was fully booked in six months. HIF Global, focused on e-fuels; Sempen, on green ammonia; and Fuella AS, on green hydrogen, are among the companies that have signed contracts. The port is now working on licensing an additional 3.5 million square meters.

According to Mauro Andrade, executive director of business development at Prumo, the Port of Açu will partner with the companies that establish themselves in the hub and will offer, in addition to the already issued preliminary environmental permit, a shared infrastructure that includes a water station, liquid storage terminal, and power substation.

“This reduces the capex of the projects and makes them more competitive. In practice, we are assuming part of the risk for these companies, and with that we are able to attract more developers to the hub,” Mr. Andrade said. “We will also help the players access financing lines.”

Of the nine companies that have already confirmed sustainable aviation fuel production in Brazil, four chose the HEFA route, which uses oils and fats of plant or animal origin as raw material, like Acelen. Another four, such as Petrobras, opted for co-processing, which blends renewable feedstocks with crude oil in refineries. Only one has adopted the ATJ route, the most expensive of the three.

According to Heloísa Borges, director of oil, gas and biofuels studies at EPE, Brazil’s well-developed ethanol industry gives the country strong potential to become a leader in SAF production via the ATJ route.

“Our projections indicate that the HEFA route should predominate until 2030 and that afterward ATJ will gain more ground.

(RFD-TV)— The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the U.N. body regulating global shipping, is pushing for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with benchmarks set for 2030 and 2040. That’s creating new demand for low-carbon fuels, and ethanol may be well-positioned. Corn growers are also looking to the national adoption of E15 sales as another way to boost sales and the economy.

Ethanol Finds Footing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Ankit Chandra of the U.S. Grains & BioProducts Council (USGBC) points out that America already has 18 billion gallons of ethanol production capacity, record exports of nearly 2 billion gallons last year, and the infrastructure of ports, rail, and barges to deliver supply chains today.

The global Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) market is forecast to surge from $2.06 billion in 2025 to $25.62 billion by 2030, a compound annual growth rate of nearly 65 percent. Meanwhile, marine biofuels used in shipping were valued at $3.94 billion in 2024 and are projected to almost double by 2034.

For U.S. farmers, this could mean expanded demand for corn ethanol, soybean oil, and biomass as feedstocks for SAF and marine fuels. Success, however, depends on carbon certification standards, compliance with IMO and SAF rules, engine approvals, and investments in conversion and logistics.

Farm-Level Takeaway: Ethanol producers face a widening opportunity window as aviation and marine fuel markets expand, with the potential to add billions in demand if policy and certification align.

Could Year-Round E15 Bring in the Big Bucks?

According to a new study for the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) and the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), unrestricted sales of the corn-based biofuel could have a $25 billion economic impact while also helping to create a home for increased corn production.

The nation currently exports nearly $4 billion in suitable feedstocks, including canola (rapeseed) and tallow, with other promising sources like sugar, sorghum, and various waste products offering significant potential for domestic conversion into clean fuels.
It builds on support already provided through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund, which has already allocated $250 million to low-carbon liquid fuels research and development.
The Program will offer competitive grants to private sector companies to encourage the establishment of onshore production facilities.
By investing in this sector, Australia is not only taking a critical step toward its own net-zero goals but is also aiming to become an indispensable part of global clean energy supply chains.","In a landmark move to accelerate the nation’s transition to a low-carbon economy, the Australian government on September 17 announced a significant investment of AU$1.1 billion ($731.84 million) into the domestic production of low-carbon liquid fuels. The funding, which will be distributed through a new 10-year competitive grants scheme called the Clean Fuels Program, aims to stimulate onshore investment and build robust supply chains for fuels such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The announcement positions Australia to become a key player in the global net-zero transformation, a market that the government believes could be worth up to $36 billion to the Australian economy. The investment is specifically targeted at reducing emissions in 'hard-to-abate' sectors like aviation, heavy-duty freight, and mining, which are difficult to electrify.

Australia is uniquely positioned to lead in this emerging industry, thanks to its extensive agricultural sector and a growing supply of affordable and reliable renewable energy. The nation currently exports nearly $4 billion in suitable feedstocks, including canola (rapeseed) and tallow, with other promising sources like sugar, sorghum, and various waste products offering significant potential for domestic conversion into clean fuels.

This new production-linked incentive is not an isolated policy but rather a strategic expansion of previous government commitments. It builds on support already provided through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund, which has already allocated $250 million to low-carbon liquid fuels research and development. The new program will also require grant recipients to adhere to the community benefit principles outlined in the Future Made in Australia Act, ensuring that new projects deliver tangible benefits to local communities.

The Program will offer competitive grants to private sector companies to encourage the establishment of onshore production facilities. The government has confirmed that the detailed design and eligibility criteria for the program are currently being developed through a public consultation process and are expected to be finalized during the current financial year, which ends on June 30, 2026. This process will pave the way for applications to open in the 2026-27 financial year.

Aviation safety remains equally prominent on IATA’s agenda, with specific concerns about Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) interference affecting aircraft navigation near conflict zones.
Decisions made during the Montreal assembly will influence global aviation policy through 2028.
The assembly’s outcomes will determine whether the aviation industry can accelerate progress toward its 2050 net-zero emissions commitment or face additional regulatory constraints from individual governments acting independently.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) will present an ambitious nine-point agenda at next week’s global aviation summit, demanding accelerated sustainable fuel production and coordinated action on climate targets that could reshape the industry’s environmental trajectory.

The 42nd Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) convenes Monday in Montreal for 11 days, bringing together representatives from 193 member states to establish worldwide aviation policy for the next three years. IATA has submitted 14 working papers covering diverse areas including sustainability, safety, operations, and digitization.

Willie Walsh, IATA Director General, emphasized the urgency of environmental commitments ahead of the assembly. “It is critical that we secure stronger support for SAF production and CORSIA as key enablers of aviation’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050,” Walsh stated.

The association’s primary concern centers on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, which remains critically insufficient despite growing demand. Current projections show SAF production will double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, yet this represents merely 0.7% of airline fuel needs.

IATA’s sustainability push includes strengthening the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), established in 2016 as the sole global economic measure addressing aviation emissions. The scheme expects to generate up to $17 billion in climate finance by 2035, yet implementation challenges persist across participating nations.

The organization demands governments resist creating additional aviation taxes that undermine CORSIA’s effectiveness. Multiple jurisdictions continue implementing national and regional taxation schemes that conflict with the unified global approach, creating regulatory fragmentation that complicates industry compliance efforts.

Aviation safety remains equally prominent on IATA’s agenda, with specific concerns about Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) interference affecting aircraft navigation near conflict zones. The association seeks enhanced coordination between military and civil aviation authorities to provide airlines with timely risk assessments.

Radio frequency spectrum protection emerges as another critical priority, particularly regarding the 4.2-4.4 gigahertz band essential for radio altimeters. Telecommunications industry expansion of 5G services has created safety risks near airports, requiring costly mitigation measures and aircraft retrofits that face supply chain delays.

IATA proposes raising commercial airline pilot age limits from 65 to 67 for multi-pilot international flights, maintaining existing safety safeguards including the requirement for at least one pilot under 65. This change reflects longer, healthier careers while addressing industry workforce challenges.

Consumer protection regulations present another area of concern, with IATA arguing that patchwork implementations across jurisdictions confuse travelers and create compliance burdens. The association seeks alignment with established global standards rather than conflicting national approaches.

The assembly occurs amid broader industry transformation pressures, including post-pandemic recovery challenges and accelerating environmental regulations. Airlines face increasing pressure from governments, investors, and consumers to demonstrate measurable progress on sustainability commitments.

The gathering brings together more than 2,000 participants to shape aviation’s future across safety, security, sustainability, economic development, and digital innovation. Decisions made during the Montreal assembly will influence global aviation policy through 2028.

IATA represents 350 airlines comprising over 80% of global air traffic, giving the organization significant influence over industry standards and regulatory development. The association’s submissions to ICAO typically carry substantial weight in final policy determinations.

MUMBAI: The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) will take up 14 working papers submitted by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) at its 42nd Assembly in Montreal this month. These papers cover aviation safety, sustainability, and efficiency, with a strong focus on boosting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, reaffirming CORSIA as the sole global climate measure, safeguarding critical radio frequencies amid 5G rollouts, and addressing issues such as accident reporting, pilot retirement age, and aviation taxation. ""It is critical that we secure stronger support for SAF production and CORSIA as key enablers of aviation’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Equally, we need agreement to follow the principles and provisions of the Chicago Convention to avoid patchworks of debilitating tax measures and passenger rights regulations. And we must shore up safety with timely accident reports, mitigations for GNSS interference, and preservation of critical radio-frequency spectrum,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. The ICAO Assembly, held every three years, is a pivotal event where global standards for aviation are set. These standards, developed with input from airline operators and ICAO Member States, are essential for ensuring safe, efficient, and sustainable aviation operations worldwide. Among the key topics IATA will present involve Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Production. IATA urged countries (States) to support the creation of a functioning SAF market and to provide economic incentives for fuel producers. IATA also called for reaffirmation of CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) as the sole economic measure for managing aviation’s climate impact. “CORSIA is expected to generate up to $17 billion in climate finance by 2035. However, states continue to create or augment aviation taxes and schemes (national and regional) that undercut CORSIA’s credibility, and which do little or nothing to further sustainability. Moreover, only Guyana has issued CORSIA Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) which generate climate finance and enable airlines to fulfil their CORSIA obligations,” said IATA in a press statement. It asked states to make available sufficient CORSIA EEUs for airlines to be able to fulfil their CORSIA obligations. On the subject of Aviation Corporate Tax, IATA will advocate against adopting source-based corporate taxation, which could lead to administrative burdens and potential double taxation. It supports the continuation of residency-based taxation for airlines. With regards to consumer protection, IATA sought alignment with ICAO’s Core Principles to avoid conflicting regulations and ensure shared accountability for traveller disruptions. The working paper on flight safety will bring attention to the 5G and 6G spectrum rollouts planned by the telecom industry. These rollouts are demanding greater allocations of radio frequency spectrum, said IATA, adding that aviation requires spectrum for many purposes, including the critical 4.2-4.4 GHz band for radio altimeters. “Some configurations for 5G rollouts (particularly in the US, Australia, and Canada) have created unacceptable risks to aviation safety in the vicinity of airports, which required mitigation measures (reconfiguration of 5G antenna as airlines retrofit with interference-proof avionics). Due to supply chain challenges and the time needed to develop and test global standards, retrofit timelines are not going to be met,” it said. IATA will ask states to protect safety-critical frequencies used by aviation from interference and strengthen coordination among telecoms and aviation regulators to ensure the safety of flight, follow best practices of successful implementations, and agree on realistic timelines for any retrofits. The airlines' trade body will also continue to stress for timely completion of accident investigation reports to enhance aviation safety, better coordination to mitigate risks from GNSS jamming and spoofing near conflict zones, and realistic timelines for aircraft mandates to avoid delays in safety benefits. On the subject of pilot age limit, IATA said it supports raising the retirement age for multi-pilot international operations to 67, with appropriate medical oversight.

Case study: Supporting low-carbon hydrogen in Korea

Approtium is the largest independent hydrogen producer and supplier in Korea, managing approximately 60km of hydrogen pipeline infrastructure and a fleet of 250 tube trailers – trucks that transport hydrogen gas – to deliver its products to customers across the nation.

Through its specialised pipeline infrastructure, Approtium efficiently and reliably provides hydrogen to a wide network of connected companies, distributed across major industrial complexes in the highly industrialised Ulsan region.

Using tube trailers, it also supplies high-quality hydrogen to customers with high-precision manufacturing processes, such as semiconductor manufacturing, which require ultra-high purity hydrogen products.

Additionally, Approtium captures the carbon dioxide produced from its hydrogen production plants via carbon capture systems to produce liquefied carbon dioxide, which is then distributed to clients for use in a variety of ways, including at critical stages within semiconductor manufacturing, to produce dry ice, and in shipbuilding processes.

The South Korean government aims for one third of the country’s energy to be sourced from low-carbon hydrogen by 2050.

To achieve this goal, (including meeting the predicted future demand that will arise from domestic energy consumption) alongside an increase in local production of hydrogen, the country is expected to become a net importer of low-carbon hydrogen.

Increasing the distribution of low carbon-hydrogen will help drive its adoption and support South Korea’s energy transition, particularly in industrial processes and power generation, which cannot be decarbonised through renewable electricity alone.

EGNOS achieves this by using over 40 ground stations across Europe to monitor GPS signals.
The updated signals are then transmitted via geostationary satellites back to users on Earth, enabling improved precision and confidence in the navigation data.
Saving time, fuel and emissions EGNOS not only improves safety, but also helps airlines reduce costs and minimise their environmental impact.
Supporting helicopter rescue missions Beyond commercial aviation, EGNOS plays a vital role in emergency medical services.","The Wright brothers made history with the first powered flight in 1903, since then, aviation has undergone remarkable transformations, becoming safer, more efficient, and more accessible

One of the latest advancements leading this evolution is satellite navigation, specifically, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service, or EGNOS.

What is EGNOS?

EGNOS is Europe’s satellite-based augmentation system, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of GPS signals. While GPS alone provides positioning accuracy within about five metres, EGNOS improves that to one to two metres, while also delivering vital information about signal integrity.

This is especially important in aviation, where even slight inaccuracies can pose serious safety risks. EGNOS achieves this by using over 40 ground stations across Europe to monitor GPS signals. These stations send data to control centres, which calculate corrections and integrity information. The updated signals are then transmitted via geostationary satellites back to users on Earth, enabling improved precision and confidence in the navigation data.

The LPV-200 revolutionised aviation.

One of the most significant contributions of EGNOS to aviation is the LPV-200 service, which stands for “Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance.” This service allows pilots to perform precision landings similar to Category I Instrument Landing System (CAT I ILS) procedures, which are traditionally reliant on expensive ground-based infrastructure.

LPV-200, however, uses satellite data instead of ground installations, making it far more accessible and cost-effective, especially for smaller airports that may lack the resources for ILS systems. With a decision height of 200 feet, LPV-200 gives pilots the ability to land safely even in limited visibility conditions.

More than 500 airports across Europe now benefit from EGNOS-enabled LPV approaches, which not only enhance safety but also improve operational flexibility.

Saving time, fuel and emissions

EGNOS not only improves safety, but also helps airlines reduce costs and minimise their environmental impact. LPV procedures enable aircraft to land at alternative airports with fewer diversions or holding patterns, resulting in shorter flight times, lower fuel consumption, and reduced CO₂ emissions. This makes flying more efficient for airlines and more sustainable for the planet.

Supporting helicopter rescue missions

Beyond commercial aviation, EGNOS plays a vital role in emergency medical services. Helicopters are essential for reaching patients in remote or hard-to-access areas, but poor weather and low visibility have historically limited their operations. EGNOS enables satellite-guided routes to be established, allowing helicopters to land safely at hospitals, mountain rescue zones, or offshore platforms, even under challenging conditions.

This capability is transforming air rescue operations across Europe, supporting faster and safer emergency responses when every second counts.

The move is part of Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab initiative, aligning with the airline’s decarbonization goals and efforts to reduce emissions across its regional network.

The MAEVE Jet, as envisioned, will carry 76 to 100 passengers in a single-aisle, five-abreast configuration. Maeve Aerospace advertises that its hybrid-electric powerplant, combined with an optimized wing design, could yield cost savings of up to 40% when using conventional jet fuel, and by as much as 95% when using Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

A Look At The MAEVE Jet

The MAEVE Jet, also known as the MJ 500, is a new regional jet concept being developed by European manufacturer Maeve Aerospace. It's meant to seat between 76 and 100 seats, which places it in direct competition with the Embraer E175. Maeve has been progressively evolving the concept for years, and it's likely that this could be close to the final configuration.

The major innovation with Maeve's new aircraft is the hybrid-electric powerplant. Thrust will come from two open-rotor engines, and according to Maeve, this will save airlines tremendous amounts of fuel and money. Open rotor technology has been considered for numerous aircraft projects in the past (most recently with the successor to the Airbus A320neo), while several companies are working on electric or hybrid electric powerplants for smaller aircraft like air taxis.

This is the first serious effort to combine open rotor technology with hybrid electric propulsion on an aircraft this size. While the design has not been frozen and Maeve is still looking for additional partners, this is one of the most serious efforts for a clean-sheet aircraft in today's market. The investment from Delta is perhaps Maeve's most significant announcement to date.

The MJ 500's Place In The Market (And What It Means For Delta)

While competition between Airbus and Boeing is as intense as ever, there's a noticeable lack of new developments in the market for regional airliners. Bombardier has fully exited the commercial aircraft market, while Mitsubishi is no longer producing the CRJ. De Havilland is still building a new facility to assemble the Dash 8, and Embraer's E175-E2 is currently on hold as it is not scope-compliant in the US. This is also the case for the larger E190-E2 and E195-E2 models.

As such, the only major smaller regional airliners in production are the Embraer E175, ATR42-600, and ATR72-600. All of these are prior-generation aircraft, and while they remain in production, they're hardly efficient by today's standards. Delta Air Lines is, of course, a major operator of the E175 and essentially has no other choice if it expands its Delta Connection fleet or decides to replace older aircraft.

The Maeve MJ 500 not only promises innovative technology, but it also taps into a market that is lacking innovation and investment. With an advertised three-class (first/business, extra legroom economy, economy) capacity of 76 seats and a 34-tonne Maximum Takeoff Weight, the aircraft is clearly developed with US feeder airlines in mind. Such carriers are the world's largest operators of regional aircraft.

Broader Marker Prospects For The MJ 500

The MJ 500 has significant promise, but reservations remain about startup manufacturers that may struggle to maintain consistent funding. The airliner industry is capital-intensive and requires scale, which is why there are so few manufacturers. Maeve has already partnered with Mitsubishi and is reportedly looking to find more partners, which would boost its long-term chances of survival.

With a five-abreast layout, the MJ 500's design is clearly intended to support future growth. The only five-abreast airliner in production today is the far larger Airbus A220, while the Embraer E2, a four-abreast airliner, may have reached its limit in its E195-E2 variant, which matches the A220 in capacity. By going five-abreast, this aircraft will be easier to stretch into a larger version.

With a 100 passenger single class layout, the MJ 500 is advertised to have a range of 950 nautical miles (1,759 kilometers), and a range of 1,450 nautical miles (2,685 kilometers) when configured for US flying. These numbers are limited, but should still be acceptable for regional missions. As a whole, the MJ 500 is a promising aircraft, and its success will most likely depend on whether its manufacturer can survive and support it.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/maeve_hero.png?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-19 11:56:16.276528

On 18 September, the Albanese government announced a new emissions reduction target of 62 - 70% by 2035.

Ambitious as it may seem, the government reckons it is achievable. There is a multi-pronged plan in place including a $5bn Net Zero Fund and $2bn allocated to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC). There’s even a $50m budget to get sport clubs to decarbonise their operations.

As part of its plan, the government has also announced a $1.1bn push to incentivise the production of low carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) in Australia. The CEFC, Australia’s state-backed investor, estimates this to be a $36bn opportunity in which the country possesses a hefty comparative advantage.

Billion-dollar idea

From Canberra’s perspective, there is an inherent and urgent appeal to increasing LCLF production. Over 80% of its liquid fuel demand is serviced from overseas. In addition, these fuels account for 32% of Australia’s emissions and half of the country’s energy use.

The government’s new Clean Fuels Program is a grant financing package spread over the next decade. It offers support to domestic LCLF players producing sustainable aviation fuel and low-carbon diesel. The use-case for these fuels is concentrated in hard-to-electrify transport segments such as aviation and shipping.

According to the government’s statement, the first production of ‘drop-in’ LCLF – which can be used in today’s engines – is expected by 2029.

Beneficiaries

Beneficiaries of the scheme will include companies such as HAMR Energy – a LCLF producer currently finalising a $10m series A funding round.

“This is a major boost for LCLF production in Australia, putting in place the incentives so project proponents like HAMR Energy can rapidly scale the industry”, says co-founder David Stribley.

Earlier in the year, when CEFC published a LCLF market study – it found evidence of a first mover advantage on offer. Much of the thesis rests on the country’s agro-industrial base and the supply of feedstock.

“We have MoUs for our feedstock - locally-sourced forestry residues which will provide an additional income source for that industry; we have strong demand for offtake from shipping and aviation companies; and now there is Federal funding in place that will be catalyst for LCLF production”, Stribley adds.

Licella, another LCLF company also welcomed the government’s financing package. The company’s proposed biorefinery in Queensland received $8m in funding support from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.

“Our technology is efficient, highly scalable, and combines low-cost production with access to abundant, low-carbon feedstocks. This gives Australia a genuine competitive advantage in producing the next generation of sustainable fuels”, says Dr. Len Humphreys, Licella’s chief executive.

Foreign clean fuel producers have also welcomed Canberra’s announcement. LanzaJet, which is aiming to deliver the country’s first ethanol-to-SAF plant in Queensland is one such company. Jimmy Samartzis, the company’s chief executive, commended Australia’s leaders for their ‘demonstrated vision and pragmatism’.

Missing piece

While the new funding is supply-side support, the demand-side of the equation is equally critical to the financial viability of LCLF businesses. HAMR Energy’s Stribley says progress on that front is being made.

“With significant supply-side support, the missing piece of the puzzle is on the demand-side. Globally this is already underway, with the International Maritime Organisation set to introduce a carbon price and international markets adopting SAF mandates”, Stribley notes.

The ability of LCLF companies to deploy their solutions at scale will depend on not only the underlying economics of their businesses but also investor conviction in their plans.

As these companies move up the financing ladder, at some point institutional financiers might fancy a seat at the table.

A significant milestone has been reached at Portland International Airport (PDX), where Delta Air Lines, in collaboration with Shell and the Port of Portland, successfully completed its first commercial-scale delivery of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This marks a promising step forward in the evolution of greener air travel.

What Comes with This First Delivery?

The delivery encompassed over 400,000 gallons of blended SAF integrated into PDX’s fuel system. The fuel, a blend of conventional jet fuel and neat SAF supplied by Shell, was mixed at Zenith Terminal in Portland. The neat SAF originates from waste-derived feedstock produced in the United States, showcasing how innovative waste resources are powering the skies sustainably.

Transportation of the blended fuel to Portland International Airport involved multiple stages, including barge, truck, and pipeline movement, demonstrating a complex but coordinated logistics effort supporting this eco-friendly aviation initiative.

How Does Sustainable Aviation Fuel Impact Travel and Transfers?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel offers a notable reduction—over 80%—in carbon emissions compared with traditional jet fuel throughout its lifecycle. Although SAF technology is still advancing and production capacity is limited, initiatives like Delta’s delivery at PDX reflect a future where airports and airlines can support greener skies. For travelers, these developments could influence the carbon footprint of their flights and the overall sustainability of airport operations, including services such as taxi and transfer fleets that might also shift towards eco-conscious solutions over time.

Delta’s Role and Collaborative Strategy

This delivery is part of Delta’s larger plan to expand SAF availability and infrastructure in various airport hubs. Prior to Portland, Delta facilitated commercial SAF deliveries at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP) and Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW). A broad coalition of partners, including local and federal stakeholders, collaborates to foster a sustainable SAF market and delivery system through the Port of Portland.

Furthermore, Delta actively supports government incentives aimed at encouraging SAF production and making it competitively priced. Significant incentives introduced in 2022, including tax credits for SAF blenders and clean fuel production, have helped propel the industry forward and are extended through 2029, hinting at robust future growth.

Understanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

SAF is an alternative jet fuel derived from renewable resources such as waste oils and plants. It is designed to substitute part of the fossil-based jet fuel in aircraft engines with minimal or no modification needed to existing infrastructure or planes. The ecological benefits are clear—it can slash carbon emissions by more than 80% over traditional fuels.

Aspect Details Fuel Source Waste-derived feedstock, plants, used cooking oils Carbon Emission Reduction More than 80% lifecycle reduction compared to conventional jet fuel Current Limitations Low production volume, high cost, emerging technology Engine Compatibility Compatible with existing aircraft engines and airport fuel delivery systems

Challenges Ahead

While SAF presents a game-changing opportunity for reducing aviation’s environmental impact, production volumes remain small and insufficient to meet the global demand of the airline industry. High costs, evolving technologies, and scaling delivery infrastructure are still hurdles to overcome. However, airline industry leaders and governments continue to focus on overcoming these challenges through collaborative frameworks and financial incentives.

Link to Taxi and Transfer Services

Airports are complex transport ecosystems—not just about flights but also about the ground services that connect passengers to and from their destinations. Sustainable aviation fuel’s progressive adoption aligns with a broader move toward greener transportation modes, including taxis and transfers. Companies and platforms, such as GetTransfer.com, support travelers by offering transparent access to vehicles with details about the type, ratings, and pricing—helping passengers choose rides that match their eco-conscious values and exact travel needs.

The plan reduces emissions and fuels green growth across the aviation and energy sectors.

Korea’s sustainable aviation fuel mandate signals a decisive shift in the country’s climate action strategy. From 2027, airlines flying internationally from Korean airports must use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This firm policy underscores Korea’s ambition to reduce aviation emissions while embracing global clean energy goals. Crucially, the mandate will stimulate new investment and technological growth in the energy sector.

Airlines will start by blending at least 1 per cent SAF with standard jet fuel. By 2030, the requirement will rise to 3–5 per cent and further increase to 7–10 per cent by 2035. These targets ensure a steady and manageable transition across the aviation industry.

SAF uses waste materials, used cooking oil, and renewable resources. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with traditional jet fuel. Therefore, it offers a vital solution for the aviation industry’s long-term sustainability. In addition, the policy supports international targets such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s climate commitments and the European Union’s ReFuelEU initiative.

Government officials emphasised that the rule will boost local demand for SAF. As a result, refiners, chemical firms, and energy companies are preparing to scale production and expand supply networks. To accelerate progress, the government will also deliver subsidies, tax relief, and certification systems that guarantee SAF quality and track pricing fairly.

Furthermore, airlines, refiners, and research institutions have allied. Together, they plan to expand production capacity and ensure a reliable supply. By shifting to SAF, Korea will reduce emissions, cut reliance on imported fuel, and unlock new business opportunities.",https://theelectricityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AVIATION-FUEL.png,N,,2025-09-19 12:57:24.556210

The report outlined meticulous details on the need for SAF across the global aviation sector, and detailed India’s production potential and readiness for this green fuel.

The report suggested that, “The aviation industry has shown steady growth and resilience, becoming a key driver of global connectivity and economic development. However, rising concerns over climate change have placed increasing pressure on the sector to decarbonise”.

The report said that without effective mitigation, aviation emissions are projected to rise significantly and comprise a larger share of global emissions by 2050. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has introduced the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to limit emissions to 85% of 2019 levels, while the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

The report said that SAF has emerged as the most viable near, mid and long-term solution to decarbonise the aviation sector, and is projected to contribute 53-66% of total sectoral emission reductions.

India’s prowess in SAF production- A potential gamechanger

India’s aviation sector is projected to lead global growth in air passenger traffic, with an annual expected growth by 11%-13% until 2030.

The report said, “As a result, demand for SAF is expected to rise in parallel, driven by proposed blending mandates (1% by 2027 and 2% by 2028, reaching upto 5% by 2030 for international travel), airline sustainability commitments, and corporate net-zero goals”.

The report said that India’s robust sugar industry has the ability to produce 350 to 400 Cr liters of SAF via surplus ethanol from the 1G route alone, by 2040. “The sector holds the potential to meet over ~50% of India’s total SAF demand by 2040. In the near term, the report projects that the sugar sector can easily support 125 to 150 Cr liters of SAF production in 2030 without any disruptions in the ongoing sugar supply or ongoing ethanol blending,” the report outlined.

Commenting on the report, Deepak Ballani, DG of Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) said that “India has a unique opportunity to lead the global transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with the ISMA–Deloitte Report charting a clear roadmap to not only meet our CORSIA commitments but also realise the Government of India’s vision of making the nation a SAF export hub. These findings are reinforced by the ICAO ACT–SAF Capacity-Building Report for India, which identifies Alcohol-to-Jet as the most viable pathway for our long-term SAF demand, with sugarcane-based feedstock offering the most scalable and lowest-carbon solution”.

He further added that the report underlines the readiness of India’s biofuel industry to lead the next wave of global decarbonisation. “We have the feedstock, aggregation systems, and technology in place. With an enabling ecosystem—akin to the Ethanol Blending Programme—we can rapidly scale SAF production, adoption, and consumption, all at once. This transformation is not just about cleaner skies; it is about empowering our farmers to fuel the future of global aviation while fulfilling our Viksit Bharat and Atmanirbhar Bharat goals,” he said.

However, the report highlights some key recommendations that can effectively support the scale-up of SAF production and use in India.

There is a need for a coherent and phased policy framework which is essential for unlocking the full potential of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in India. The report said, that “One of the most effective ways to create market demand is through mandatory blending targets beyond CORSIA. By providing long-term certainty to both producers and end-users, such mandates can guide investment decisions and align SAF deployment with national decarbonization goals. Amongst other recommendations are- (i). Offering time-bound financial support such as tax incentives, viability gap funding, or capital subsidies could help improve early-stage project viability. (ii). Considering a Price Cap Mechanism and Long-Term Offtake Agreements (iii). Streamlining Regulatory Approvals, and (iv).

Joshua NevettPolitical reporter

The UK government's climate change advisory panel has said it has not yet been asked to formally assess how plans to expand Heathrow airport would impact on carbon emissions targets.

The Climate Change Committee (CCC) told the BBC it would give a view on plans to build a third runway at Heathrow if advice was requested.

The government said the expansion must not breach the UK's legally binding target of lowering emissions to net zero by 2050.

The CCC is required by law to assess whether the target will be met and it has repeatedly cautioned against airport expansion.

The government said it was assessing initial proposals on Heathrow expansion and would engage with the committee during the process.

Ministers can ask the CCC for ad-hoc advice on specific policy issues but is under no legal duty to follow it.

Lord Deben, a former CCC chairman, said there was ""limited space for aviation growth"" without emissions reductions.

""If they give planning permission for expansion of Heathrow that inevitably means there will be less opportunity for other airports in Britain,"" Lord Deben said.

""This must be a sensible, logical decision and the CCC must be involved in giving advice.""

Greenpeace UK said there was an obvious need for independent experts at the committee ""to assess the real risks and costs of any expansion"".

""Any attempt to side-step them would show a complete lack of confidence in Labour's stated position regarding the tests a new runway needs to pass, and more importantly, miss the legal requirement for UK carbon reductions,"" Dr Douglas Parr, policy director for Greenpeace UK, said.

The CCC also told the BBC it had not been asked to provide advice on any future expansion of Gatwick Airport.

A decision on a proposed second runway at Gatwick is expected in the coming weeks after Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was ""minded to approve"" the expansion in February.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the Labour government was backing plans for a third runway at Heathrow in January this year.

Reeves said Heathrow expansion, delayed for decades over environmental concerns, would ""make Britain the world's best connected place to do business"" and boost economic growth.

At the time, the government said the expansion ""must be delivered in line with the UK's legal, environmental and climate obligations"".

The expansion of Heathrow has long been opposed by green groups and it is expected to face resistance and probably legal challenges, not least because of its environmental impact.

In July, the CEO of Heathrow Airport, Thomas Woldbye, insisted the expansion proposal was in line with the aviation industry's target to be net zero by 2050.

But he acknowledged that planning permission would not be granted by the government unless legal limits of emissions were adhered to.

The government wants to review planning guidelines that will shape its decisions to expand Heathrow, Gatwick and other major airports.

Giving evidence to MPs this week, the CCC's chief economist, Dr James Richardson, said it wasn't too late to influence the review, which has not been launched yet.

But Labour MP Barry Gardiner said he was seriously worried the CCC was ""acquiescing in what the government is planning for aviation"".

He questioned why the government had not sought the CCC's advice before announcing its support for Heathrow's expansion.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/162b/live/5d579690-9493-11f0-ba65-8fdb5f152e03.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 11:57:10.994902

To hear from Kansas farmers and farm leaders about their concerns going into fall harvest, watch the video below.","“Gotta #FeedThe9.”

Remember that phrase from a little over a decade ago? “Feed the 9” was a rallying cry from agribusinesses and the agricultural marketing community referencing that the world’s population was going to be at or over 9 billion souls by 2050.

That's so many mouths to feed. A growing middle class that was demanding higher-quality proteins called for a growing demand for feed grains to feed those livestock. So, of course U.S. farmers were encouraged to ramp up production efficiency through seed technology, crop inputs and equipment. And there was a need to get as many people farming as possible, because farmers were less than 2% of the total U.S. population, and they were needed to feed not just the U.S. but also the world.

I remember sitting in great big halls at farm meetings, listening to futurists and market experts talk about the growing demand from China for U.S. grain and beef. But those same speakers also cautioned that this was a strategy that could come back to bite us if relations between our two nations ever turned frosty.

I recall a conversation with one agribusiness professional who had lived through the 1970s and 1980s, who told me that this felt, to them, an awful lot like “Earl Butz 2.0.” In simple terms, farmers took on a lot of debt to buy land and equipment, then planted fencerow to fencerow to feed the world grain demand. That led to overproduction and commodity prices tanking, which in turn led to trouble servicing that debt and, eventually, farm failures.

A decade ago, listening to that agribusiness professional, I remember being skeptical. “Surely we would have learned from that, and the guard rails wouldn’t let that happen again,” I thought to myself. After all, our commodity checkoffs have been building relationships for 60 years or so to create a broader export market for our goods beyond just one country. Lenders were more cautious about operating loans. And no elected or appointed officials would want to repeat that disaster on their watches through trade policy. Right?

Well, it’s 2025. And from conversations with farmers at the Kansas State Fair, I’m seeing similarities that cause me to pause. Input costs are rising above the cost of production. We’re fighting inflation and looking down the barrel of a possible recession. We’ve got a situation where China isn’t taking any U.S. new-crop soybeans — yet. And those trade issues are starting to affect our sorghum and corn export markets as well.

A Kansas soybean farmer taking their new crop to the elevator this fall harvest has to decide: Are they going to sell just enough to service their immediate loan obligations and store the rest in the short term in the hopes of price increases that may or may not cover the storage and real interest costs? Or will they sell it all at once, making about 40 cents a bushel after they cover their costs of production? Even if cash prices for new crops rally upward in the coming months, it may not be enough for some farmers to break even. Watch more from our Farm Futures ""Ag Marketing IQ in Depth"" series from July 29.

If China was still purchasing U.S. soybeans, though? According to the American Soybean Association and other experts, historically, that would have raised cash prices $2 to $3 per bushel over current prices (as of Sept. 17, $9.44 to $10.08 per bushel), with profits on a 50-bushel-per-acre yield of about $100 to $200 per acre. That would have reduced price volatility so that farmers could plan for 2026 with some predictability. It also, in general, would have supported farmland values and made a better environment for input suppliers.

But the reality is that China may not come back to purchasing U.S. soybeans anytime soon. The country may be happy with Brazil’s soybeans, with which it has replaced ours. And the trade war may go on for longer than farmers would like.

Our bright spot is that with cattle prices where they are, farmers who can walk their crop off the farm in the form of a pen of cattle, rather than drive it off in a grain wagon, may have an opportunity. Farmers who know their cost of production to the penny and learned from the mistakes of past generations may be in a position to capitalize on opportunities as they come along. And, if we can get year-round E15 finally approved and the sustainable aviation fuel industry up and running, that can support domestic demand for grains. There are opportunities that we have in 2025 that we didn’t have in 1980.

Will the U.S. “Feed the 9” though? Should Kansas farmers focus on that in 2026 and beyond? Or should they plan for reduced market demand and see Brazil and other nations fill that rallying cry? That’s up to each of you, my friends, to decide for your farms.

The world’s governments gather in Montreal at the end of September to focus on the development of global aviation at the 42nd ICAO Assembly. Turning targets, promises, and pledges of support for the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into actual SAF production should be top of mind.

Through ICAO, governments have agreed to decarbonize aviation by 2050—the epoch-defining Long-Term Global Aspirational Goal (LTAG). They also recognize the importance of SAF in achieving this and set an interim goal for SAF to enable a 5% reduction in international aviation’s carbon intensity by 2030.

Despite these commitments, SAF production is not on a trajectory to meet either of these goals. SAF production today satisfies just 0.7% of aviation’s fuel needs. And the ICAO Assembly is a golden opportunity for a critical re-set of efforts to make SAF the decarbonization driver we need it to be.

For SAF production to be possible, there has to be enough material (feedstock) available. SAF can be made from many things and in many ways, including used cooking oil, municipal waste, and agricultural residues. There is also the potential for e-SAF—SAF made by turning electrical power into liquid fuel. And whatever feedstock is used, it must be sustainable and not encroach on land or water resources needed to feed people.

The situation is encouraging. There will be enough feedstock, but it will only be available to aviation with some fundamental changes in how the SAF industry is developing. While this is no small task, the good news is that this can be influenced positively by government policy.

So, what should states focus on at the Assembly?

First, a functioning market for SAF is essential. Right now, there is far too little production of SAF and that production may not be in the physical location where the airline needs it. We can lower that barrier by adopting a book-and-claim system. If an airline can buy SAF where it is available and claim its sustainability benefits separately from the physical delivery, while verifying that there is no double-counting, then we can create a global market for SAF with infinitely more possibilities for it to be used to reduce aviation’s carbon emissions.

IATA has developed a SAF Registry to do the needed tracking. And to ensure that there is no bias in the system we have created a neutral third party to manage the Registry known as the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO). A registry cannot instantly deliver a global SAF market on its own, but with the support of governments, it can constitute foundational and indispensable market infrastructure.

Second, we need governments to update their policies when unintended consequences prevent progress. For example, mandates have had the perverse effect of driving up SAF prices when the policy objective must be to lower costs. Fuel suppliers have increased their margins on jet fuel to cover themselves for any risks related to the SAF mandates they face. As a result, Europe has become the most expensive place in the world to buy SAF with prices that are five times higher than conventional fuel. That’s monopolistic pricing behavior which it must be the duty of policy makers to prevent.

When creating new markets—energy markets in this case—the initial focus should be on developing the technology needed. Incentives are essential, to stimulate R&D, investments, production, reduce costs, and build a resilient SAF ecosystem. Mandates used too early in the process will only protect incumbents and raise their profits.

And lastly, we ask governments to look at the bigger picture when they consider their SAF policy options. SAF is a renewable fuel, part of total renewable energy production, which in turn is part of the whole energy complex. In essence, we need support to be redirected from fossil energy to renewable energies, providing low-emitting fuels to every sector, including SAF to air transportation. No sector and industry can solve their decarbonization on their own. It has to be a part of a national (regional, global) energy transition, and policy makers need to want it as much as we do.

Why sometimes they appear to not want it as much as we do is a bit of a mystery, given the gains it can bring to their economy. The energy transition can increase energy independence, create jobs, improve the agricultural sector, help preserve biodiversity, and strengthen local communities. The energy transition is a unique policy instrument for economic development across all sectors, everywhere.

There is momentum. Although still at low levels, SAF production did double in 2024 and will do so again in 2025. There are at least 160 SAF production projects that could become operational by 2030. And the list of airline agreements to purchase SAF is at 170 and rising. If governments can focus on supporting a functioning SAF market, correct mistakes when they happen, and align efforts with the big-picture possibilities of SAF, it is still possible to reach our common net zero by 2050 goal. That’s the message we’ll be taking to the ICAO Assembly.",https://www.iata.org/contentassets/22c99a2b9add47b29703266f1383da18/marie-owens-thomsen---close.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 11:57:20.884004

Abstract

The global energy transition is pushing the development of advanced biofuels to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the aviation industry. This study thoroughly evaluates the potential of the Colombian crude palm oil (CPO) sector to support sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. Extensive primary data from 53 palm oil mills and 269 palm plantations were examined. The methodology included a carbon footprint analysis of SAF produced from Colombian CPO through the HEFA pathway, an economic aspects analysis, a review of renewable fuel standards, and an assessment of market access for low-CO2-emitting feedstocks. The results show that the carbon footprint of the Colombian palm oil-SAF is 16.11 g CO2eq MJ−1 SAF, which is significantly lower than the 89.2 g CO2eq MJ−1 reference value for traditional jet fuel. This figure considers current direct Land Use-Change (DLUC) emissions and existing methane capture practices within the Colombian palm oil agro-industry. A sensitivity analysis indicated that this SAF’s carbon footprint could decrease to negative values of −4.58 g CO2eq MJ−1 if all surveyed palm oil mills implement methane capture. Conversely, excluding DLUC emissions from the assessment raised the values to 47.46 g CO2eq MJ−1, highlighting Colombia’s favorable DLUC profile as a major factor in its low overall CPO carbon footprint. These findings also emphasize that methane capture is a key low-carbon practice for reducing the environmental impact of sustainable fuel production, as outlined by the CORSIA methodology. Based on the economic analysis, investing in Colombian CPO-based SAF production is a financially sound decision. However, the project’s profitability is highly susceptible to the volatility of SAF sales prices and raw material costs, underscoring the need for meticulous risk management. Overall, these results demonstrate the strong potential of Colombian palm oil for producing sustainable aviation fuels that comply with CORSIA requirements.

1. Introduction

The past decade has witnessed a boom in the production of advanced biofuels, a consequence of the global energy transition aimed at mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the combustion of fossil fuels. Global CO2eq emissions in 2022 were reported at 57.4 billion tons, with the energy sector accounting for 36% of this total [1]. Within the energy sector, air transport was responsible for 2.5% of total GHG emissions [2]. Given the anticipated growth in global flight demand in 2023 relative to 2019 [3], the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has advocated for the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF offers a significantly reduced carbon footprint compared to traditional fossil fuels [4]. This is because SAF contributes to mitigating GHG emissions since it is produced from renewable energy feedstocks.

SAF utilizes renewable and sustainable feedstocks, such as biomass, organic waste, used cooking oils, vegetable oils, and other waste-derived feedstocks [5]. SAF is projected to contribute to a reduction of at least 65% of the GHG emissions required within the global aviation sector to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 [6]. Owing to the use of biomass as a feedstock, SAF has a lower carbon footprint than the reference fossil fuel [7]; the carbon dioxide released during combustion is roughly equivalent to the quantity sequestered by plants during photosynthesis in the production of the biomass [8]. Consequently, fuels derived from biomass possess a net-zero carbon emissions profile, rendering SAF usage effectively carbon neutral [9]. Furthermore, SAF can be blended with conventional jet fuel or used as a drop-in replacement in existing aircraft engines without requiring significant infrastructure modifications. This compatibility stems from its physicochemical properties, similar to petroleum-derived jet fuels, and its seamless integration with existing infrastructure [10].

SAF production reported about 600 million liters worldwide in 2023 [6]. Although production in 2024 was expected to triple that quantity [6], only 1300 million liters was achieved in 2024 [11]. Although it is estimated that SAF consumption will continue to grow, there is a significant concern about the availability of raw materials for this market [12]. Similarly, it is crucial for all actors in the supply chain to promote investments, policies, and regulations that encourage large-scale production and reduce associated costs, which is essential for increasing the production of SAF [6]. With the right support, UFAS can play a crucial role in a more sustainable aviation industry transition and contribute significantly to carbon emission reduction [13].

The routes to obtain SAF are classified according to the conversion process and the feedstock type used, whether waste, by-product, or co-product [4,5]. Table 1 shows the most promising technological routes for SAF production, where one of the main routes is hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). HEFA is a mature, commercially available technology [13] that involves lipid hydroprocessing feedstocks, such as vegetable oils and their respective free fatty acids, animal fats and oils, waste oils, and used cooking oils (UCO). The process involves several catalytic reactions in the presence of hydrogen that generate hydrocarbon chains as main products, along with by-products such as propane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water [14,15]. Fischer-Tropsch is another of the most promising conversion routes, which involves biomass gasification to obtain synthesis gases and ultimately a liquid biofuel [5,14,16].

Currently, the technology available at an industrial scale is the HEFA pathway for producing SAF. In contrast, medium-term technology may involve the transformation of waste biomass to SAF through gasification, Fischer-Tropsch, or pyrolysis [17]. A general overview of these two technologies applicable to the palm oil sector is shown in Figure 1. The GHG emissions generated can vary depending on the route, process, or feedstock used to produce SAF [18]. Therefore, life cycle analysis methodology is essential to determine if the SAF used can reduce the offsetting obligations of aircraft operators under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) program [7]. In the CORSIA program, the system limits range from feedstock cultivation to the combustion of SAF, with 1 MJ burned in the aircraft engine considered as a functional unit (g CO2eq/MJ).

Crude palm oil (CPO) is a vegetable oil with the potential to produce SAF. Although worldwide, the main market for CPO is the food segment (84%), about 16% of its consumption is to produce biofuels [19,20]. Therefore, CPO has a great opportunity to access new markets in the biofuel segment, as long as it contributes to GHG emissions reduction associated with the use of fossil fuels. The routes applicable in the palm oil sector include the HEFA route using CPO as a feedstock and the Fischer-Tropsch route utilizing palm biomass as a feedstock.

In Colombia, by 2024, a total of 7.8 million tons of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) were processed, yielding 1.72 million tons of crude palm oil (CPO) [20]. Although CPO is the primary product of the oil palm sector, it accounts for only 18% to 25% of the total FFB processed at the mill. Meanwhile, the biomass generated during CPO extraction contributes to about 45% of the total FFB processed. Thus, this biomass serves as a significant resource for developing products such as bioenergy, biomaterials, and biofuels [21,22].

Therefore, the country’s palm oil sector is crucial for satisfying part of the food and biomass demand required by the market to decarbonize the economy [23]. In Colombia, the palm oil sector has demonstrated significant progress in environmental performance, evidenced by the signing of Zero Deforestation Agreement, implementation of landscape management tools, the efforts in implementation of measurement and reduction in its water footprint, the application of sustainability standards (ISCC, RSPO, APS Colombia), the generation of renewable energy from biomass, and the adoption of strategies to reduce GHG emissions [20,24].

Previous studies have identified that fertilization, direct land-use change (DLUC), diesel consumption, and palm oil mill effluent (POME) treatment contribute most significantly to GHG emissions in the CPO production chain [22,25]. These emissions can be mitigated through effective low-carbon practices, such as the efficient use of chemical fertilizers, crop expansion into suitable and available areas, optimization of diesel consumption, and capture and utilization of biogas generated in the POME treatment system. It is estimated that, by applying these practices, the sector possesses the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 55%. Notably, the most substantial impact on GHG emission reduction is achieved through biogas (methane) capture, contributing a 35% reduction relative to the chain’s total emissions. In quantitative terms, if all methane generated in the POME treatment systems of the Colombian palm oil sector were captured, an estimated reduction of approximately 1.4 million tons of CO2 equivalent could be achieved [26].

To contribute to global climate change mitigation, several countries have established specific GHG emission reduction targets. Colombia, for instance, has proposed a 51% reduction in its national GHG emissions, based on projected emissions for 2030 as a reference scenario, as outlined in Colombia’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) Update [27]. Considering this, the country’s palm oil sector holds significant potential to contribute to the national emissions reduction. This contribution can be achieved particularly through the capture of methane emissions generated in the POME treatment systems and their subsequent utilization in bioenergy generation, thereby supporting the nation’s energy transition and decarbonization efforts.

This study primarily aims to: (i) assess the carbon footprint of the Colombian SAF production chain, building upon CPO carbon footprint data previously established by the authors as a national average derived from primary data collected in the field; (ii) review the regulatory landscape for renewable fuels concerning their carbon intensity; and (iii) identify strategic opportunities for market access that prioritize low-CO2-emission raw materials. This document systematically describes the calculation methodology, data acquisition sources, outcomes of the mass and energy balance, the GHG balance of the SAF production chain, the evaluation of relevant regulations, and the identified market access opportunities.

2. Materials and Methods

This section presents the study’s methodological approach, divided into four parts. Section 2.1 Briefly describe the geographical conditions of the study area and the characteristics of the palm oil sector. Section 2.2 explains the carbon footprint of SAF production from Colombian CPO, based on CPO carbon footprint data from a previous study by the authors, which used primary data collected in the field to establish a national average [22]. Section 2.3 provides a general overview of the economic aspects of SAF production using Colombian palm oil as a feedstock. Section 2.4 reviews current regulations for renewable fuels, especially regarding their carbon intensity. Section 2.5 explores opportunities for Colombian palm oil to access markets focused on CO2 emissions reduction.

2.1. Study Area

Colombia’s climate is mainly shaped by its equatorial position, the Andes Mountain Range, and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). These elements create a mostly uniform tropical climate where temperature differences are influenced by altitude, resulting in distinct thermal zones (pisos térmicos)—the warm, temperate, cold, and very cold levels. The country’s climate regions are varied, including a tropical climate in areas like the Amazon rainforest and the Pacific coast, a monsoon tropical climate with a short dry season along the southern Pacific and Caribbean coasts, and a tropical savanna climate with alternating wet and dry seasons in the Atlantic lowlands and the Eastern Plains. Annual rainfall varies greatly across the country, from as little as 267 mm in the arid Guajira Peninsula to over 9000 mm in the extremely wet Chocó department [28].

Colombia has a total land area of 114 million hectares. Of this, the agricultural frontier, or the potential area for cultivation, is 43 million hectares, which represents 34% of the country’s total land [29]. In 2021, only 5.3 million hectares were registered as cultivated, which is a mere 13.5% of the total agricultural potential. National agricultural production in Colombia is favored by the country’s climate and biophysical conditions [28], which permit the cultivation of a variety of products, including cereals, fruits, legumes, tubers, vegetables, and tropical crops like oil palm.

In 2024, the cultivated area for oil palm in Colombia was 609 thousand hectares. This resulted in the processing of 7.8 million tons of fresh fruit bunches (FFB), yielding 1.72 million tons of crude palm oil (CPO) [30]. In the sector, 32% of CPO production is certified according to sustainability standards [20].

2.2. Carbon Footprint of SAF Production

The carbon footprint of SAF production is estimated to follow the life cycle steps described in Figure 2. First, the carbon footprint of Colombian CPO production, as raw material to produce SAF, is calculated. This includes the cultivation stage, FFB transportation, CPO extraction, and direct LUC associated with the establishment of palm crops. Second, the carbon footprint of the biofuel production process is estimated, including CPO transportation, SAF transformation, and SAF burning in the engine.

2.2.1. Carbon Footprint of Colombian CPO

For this study, we utilized a previously established database developed by the same authors [22], which was created to assess the carbon footprint of the CPO production chain in Colombia. The dataset was compiled directly from palm plantations and palm oil mills across the country. The life cycle assessment (LCA) inventory for the present study was generated from that collected data, incorporating the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines, Ecoinvent emission factors (SimaPro 9 software, Ecoinvent v3 database), and national/international bibliographic and technical resources from the sector. The GHG emissions considered in the assessment included methane (CH4) from anaerobic POME degradation, carbon dioxide (CO2) from the CPO production chain, and nitrous oxide (N2O) associated with soil management and chemical fertilization. In addition, direct LUC linked to palm cultivation was incorporated. The functional unit for the analysis was defined as grams of CO2 equivalent per megajoule of fuel produced (g CO2eq MJ−1).

2.2.2. SAF Carbon Footprint from Colombian CPO, as Feedstock

The carbon footprint of SAF production is estimated following the CORSIA program methodology. This program aims to reduce GHG emissions by at least 10% compared to fossil fuel jet (89 g CO2eq MJ−1) [7]. The input and output inventories for the HEFA route process are used to calculate emissions. A functional unit of 1 megajoule of energy (1 MJ) is established since biofuel energy is the primary product of the evaluated production chain. The impact is expressed in units of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq). Figure 3 shows the system’s limits evaluated to obtain SAF in this study.

Biofuel production via the HEFA route involves processes analogous to petroleum refining, specifically hydroprocessing and distillation. HEFA requires a hydrogen-rich environment, along with high temperatures and pressures (315–370 °C and 41–101 bar), as well as catalysts to facilitate chemical reactions and the formation of desired molecules [32]. In the HEFA process, the double bonds of fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen. The triglycerides are then catalytically separated into propane and fatty acids. Subsequently, the oxygen in the fatty acids is removed through two main reactions: hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), where oxygen is replaced by hydrogen, producing water (H2O), or decarboxylation (CDO), where oxygen is removed as carbon dioxide (CO2). HDO requires higher hydrogen consumption but avoids CO2 emissions; in contrast, CDO generates CO2 and methane, which reduces the liquid fuel yield. In both cases, the reactions are controlled by selecting catalysts and adjusting operating conditions. A third reaction, decarbonylation, can produce carbon monoxide and water. Vegetable oils with high levels of saturated fatty acids are particularly suitable for the HEFA route as they demand less hydrogen, thereby optimizing the process [33,34].

2.2.3. Data Source

CPO Production Chain Data

This section provides a summary of the data sources used to calculate the carbon footprint of the Colombian CPO production chain, as detailed comprehensively in a previous study by the authors [22]. The primary data used in the Colombian CPO carbon footprint were collected through field visits. This included information from 53 palm oil mills (POM), which collectively represented 85% of the national CPO production in 2021. Likewise, data on palm cultivation were gathered from 269 plantations, accounting for 36% of the national FFB production in 2021 [22]. The geographical distribution of these participating mills and plantations across Colombia’s four palm-growing regions (north, central, eastern, and southwestern) is depicted in Figure 4 (adapted from [22]).

(a)

Plantation management

Data collected from the plantations include inputs related to chemical fertilizers, organic fertilizers, agrochemicals, and fossil fuel consumption (transport and energy). Emissions from fertilization include fertilizer production and the direct and indirect N2O emissions resulting from fertilizer application. Data was individually calculated for each participating plantation. However, to extrapolate emissions across all oil palm-growing areas, the average GHG emissions from these plantations were assumed to represent the total FFB produced per region in 2021. These regional values were then aggregated to determine the national GHG emissions for the oil palm sector. The nursery stage was not considered in the study [22].

(b)

Land-use change (LUC)

Direct LUC dynamics were analyzed at a 1:100,000 scale for Colombia’s Northern, Central, and Eastern regions, covering the period 2007 to 2020, acknowledging that Colombian palm oil cultivation is not linked to primary forest deforestation [20,35,36]. Satellite images from the LandSat program for the 2007 reference year were utilized. The Southwestern region (Tumaco) and the Urabá (Northern region) lacked sufficient cloud-free satellite images for LUC reporting. The oil palm cultivated area in 2020 was determined using the Catastro Palmero [37] layer. Table 2 (adapted from [22]) shows the percentage of areas converted to oil palm in each palm region from 2007 to 2020. Following the IPCC guidelines, this study’s LUC calculations account for terrestrial carbon fluxes resulting from land conversion. These calculations utilized a 25-year plantation lifetime and included carbon stock values from below- and above-ground palm biomass [38].

It is important to note that this study is not based on the “unused land approach” principle nor on the “low LUC risk” approach of the CORSIA methodology. The LUC dynamics during the study period show that oil palm cultivation mainly took place on land that was already used for agriculture. This confirms that the areas converted to oil palm included lands already in production, such as existing oil palm plantations, indicating replanting and management on established agricultural lands. Additionally, the shift in pasture and herbaceous vegetation reflects a move from livestock or other crops to oil palms. Regarding the areas labeled as fragmented forests, it is noteworthy that this category is particularly significant because it aligns with the “CORINE Land Cover methodology adapted for Colombia.” These areas are not primary forests but small, isolated forest patches. The analysis of these fragmented forests distinguishes between those surrounded by pastures and crops and those with secondary vegetation, which are presumed to be areas where pastures or crops were abandoned, allowing natural vegetation to recover. These findings show that the expansion of Colombia’s palm oil sector has mainly focused on intensifying land already used for agriculture, aligning with international sustainability standards.

Palm oil mill

Palm kernel oil and palm kernel meal are included in this study. Fiber and shell are utilized in the boiler as fuel to generate steam. This study does not account for CO2 emissions from the combustion of this biomass in the boilers, as biomass is considered a biogenic source [25]. A methane production rate of 0.36 m3 CH4 kg−1 chemical oxygen demand (COD) removed was assumed. For POMs equipped with anaerobic digestion ponds for biogas capture, biogas leakage was not considered in the original assessment [22]. For this study, a methane leakage factor of 5% was assumed for the covered anaerobic lagoons, consistent with data from [39,40,41].

SAF Production Data

The novelty of the present study lies in the assessment of the carbon footprint of Colombian palm oil-based SAF production. This includes detailed calculations for SAF production, which rely on data from technical literature concerning the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process. For this assessment, the CPO transport to the HEFA plant is estimated to be 50 km. Furthermore, the following key considerations were made: (i) GHG emissions associated with biofuels vary depending on the technical characteristics of the production process and the raw material supply conditions. (ii) The carbon footprint assessment encompasses processes from cultivation through the conversion of CPO into biofuel. (iii) GHG emissions from transport and conversion processes are attributed to using electricity, thermal energy, and chemical products derived from fossil sources. (iv) The produced SAF is allocated emissions based on an energy-based approach.

Consistent with international standards, the CORSIA program’s Equation (1) is used for calculating SAF emissions [31].

L S f = C O R E L C A + I L U C L C A

(1)

LSf = GHG emissions from SAF production (g CO2eq MJ−1); CORE LCA = data on CPO production as feedstock (FFB cultivation, FFB harvesting and collection, CPO extraction), feedstock transportation to processing and fuel production facilities, feedstock to fuel conversion processes, fuel transportation, and distribution to the blending point, fuel combustion in an aircraft engine = 0; ILUC LCA = induced land-use change due to raw material production.

According to Equation (1), a key component of CORSIA involves the treatment of Induced Land Use Change (ILUC), which refers to GHG emissions resulting from indirect land-use changes [31]. CORSIA adopts a consequential approach for ILUC emissions, which are then added to the core lifecycle GHG emissions (calculated using an attributional approach) to derive the total lifecycle GHG emissions (LSf) for a given SAF pathway. ILUC values for an eligible raw material are not measured directly by the operator/supplier; instead, they are derived from two distinct global economic models: GTAP-BIO and GLOBIOM. These models simulate the indirect land-use effects caused by increased demand for biofuel feedstocks. When calculating ILUC values for new pathways, if the results from these two models differ by 8.9 g CO2eq MJ−1 or less, the average value is used. If the difference is greater, the lower value plus an adjustment factor of 4.45 g CO2eq MJ−1 is applied [31].

CORSIA provides a default CORE LCA value for palm oil HEFA with methane capture set at 37.4 g CO2eq MJ−1, while without methane capture, it is 60.0 g CO2eq MJ−1 [31]. Additionally, the CORSIA default ILUC LCA value for eligible fuels produced via the HEFA conversion process is 39.1 CO2eq MJ−1 [42]. Aircraft operators seeking to claim emission reductions from using CORSIA-eligible fuels can use either actual life cycle emissions or these default values for their calculations. It is crucial to note that both the default CORE LCA and ILUC values for palm oil HEFA have been established by CORSIA mainly for leading biofuel-producing and aviation fuel-consuming regions, including the USA, EU, Brazil, and Malaysia/Indonesia. As a result, other countries do not fall within this framework and lack CORSIA-specific default values, which affects their classification as eligible SAF feedstock producers [31]. Therefore, they cannot apply Equation (1) to determine GHG emissions from SAF production (LSf).

According to CORSIA’s regulations, biofuel feedstock and its associated land use type are classified as ineligible if the combined emissions from direct land use change (DLUC) and the core life cycle analysis (CORE LCA) fail to meet the established sustainability threshold (DLUC + CORE LCA) [9]. This criterion ensures that the total GHG impact of a fuel source is below a predetermined limit (10% reduction) to be considered viable for the CORSIA program. It is also important to note that under CORSIA guidelines, and independent of the ILUC value established by ICAO for SAF feedstocks, the DLUC of these feedstocks is a mandatory component of the assessment.

Since Colombia’s palm oil lacks an established ILUC value; we estimated the DLUC according to CORSIA’s methodology, as it was shown in CPO Production Chain Data Section. This step is crucial for establishing a carbon footprint value for Colombian palm oil, which can then be used to benchmark against data from other producing countries. In the sensitivity analysis section, we present several scenarios to account for the uncertainty surrounding the ILUC value for Colombian palm oil. These scenarios are based on a range of assumptions to provide a more robust analysis.

Sensitivity Analysis

To assess the robustness of the calculated carbon footprint of SAF production and evaluate the influence of critical parameters, a sensitivity analysis was performed. This analysis specifically examined the impact of GHG emissions across the entire palm oil production chain under several distinct scenarios, focusing on (i) LUC impact, comparing scenarios that either incorporate or exclude the direct LUC impact associated with oil palm cultivation. (ii) ILUC impact of Colombian palm oil by comparing three scenarios. The first scenario assumes the same ILUC value as Malaysian palm oil, while the other two consider a lower ILUC value for Colombian palm oil, set at 20% and 30% of the Malaysian value, respectively. (iii) Closed pond treatment to meet the required emission savings by the CORSIA methodology. This comprehensive comparison allowed for a clear understanding of the individual and combined contributions of these factors to the overall environmental performance.

2.3. Analysis of Economic Aspects

A technical and economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of producing SAF from palm oil in Colombia. The study examined two different scenarios, each with a capacity of 400,000 tons per year. The first scenario considers building a new, standalone plant, while the second involves converting an existing refinery. The financial assessment for both scenarios included capital expenditure (CAPEX), operating expenses (OPEX), the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and the Net Present Value (NPV). Additionally, an analysis was carried out to measure how changes in sale prices, feedstock costs, and energy prices could affect the project’s overall profitability.

2.4. Regulation for Renewable Fuels in Line with CO2 Emissions

A systematic bibliographic review was conducted to identify and analyze current regulatory frameworks to evaluate renewable fuels. This review encompassed European, U.S., and Colombian regulations, alongside relevant international standards applicable to the aviation sector.

2.5. Opportunities to Access Markets for CO2 Emission Reductions

To assess market access opportunities related to CO2 emission reductions, this study analyzes the business potential for SAF production from Colombian palm oil.

3. Results

Building upon the CPO carbon footprint data established in a previous study by the authors [22], the novel findings of the present work are detailed as follows: (i) the GHG balance associated with palm oil-derived SAF production; (ii) a general overview of the economic aspects of SAF production; (iii) an analysis of relevant renewable fuel regulatory frameworks; and (vi) an evaluation of market access potential for fuels that contribute to GHG emission reduction.

3.1. Emissions Balance

3.1.1. Balance of Colombian CPO Emissions

The carbon footprint of CPO is reported to be 4.81 g CO2eq MJ−1. This value is determined through emission allocation based on the energy content of the co-products: CPO, palm kernel oil, and palm kernel meal. Figure 5 shows the carbon footprint and GHG emissions in the CPO production chain for 2021. This information is adapted from a prior study by the authors [22] in which the carbon footprint was calculated using economic allocation of the co-products 182 kg CO2eq t−1 CPO.

The primary contributors to these GHG emissions were methane (CH4) from POME treatment and the application of chemical fertilizers. A significant finding from the previous study was that direct LUC related to national oil palm cultivation between 2007 and 2020 primarily involved transitions from existing agricultural lands, specifically palm-to-palm (55.3%), pasture-to-palm (18.5%), and grassland-to-palm (11.3%). While 7.2% of LUC during this period involved fragmented forest conversion, this represented a negligible 0.7% of Colombia’s total deforestation attributed to oil palm, as reported by Satelligence [36]. This finding is corroborated by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies (IDEAM), which indicates that approximately 99% of oil palm plantations in Colombia are deforestation-free [43]. The Colombian palm oil sector has adopted Zero Deforestation and Non-Replacement of High Conservation Value (HCV) Areas as one of the ten Principles of Sustainable Palm Oil in Colombia, as outlined in the Colombian Palm Oil Sector Sustainability Strategy [20].

Some additional findings that stand out from the previous study [22] are (i) the Southwestern region reported the highest GHG emissions due to the LUC was primarily palm-to-palm, maintaining a carbon sequestration ratio of 113 t C ha−1 between 2007 and 2021. It is important to note that the Southwestern region represented only 4.4% of Colombia’s total CPO output in 2021. (ii) The Eastern region exhibited lower emissions associated with FFB and CPO production, accompanied by a substantial increase in carbon sequestration within its plantations. Also, this region showed a low footprint attributed to a higher adoption rate of biogas capture in POME treatment systems, effectively reducing methane emissions. (iii) Biogas capture in POME treatment is a critical factor in reducing emissions. For 2021, seven of the 53 analyzed mills had reduced CH4 emissions through biogas capture and flaring (five using it for electricity). Demonstrating a strong commitment to environmental performance, the Colombian palm oil sector is projected to achieve a substantial 25% reduction in CH4 emissions from its 2021 baseline, as methane capture systems are implemented in twelve more processing plants between 2021 and 2024.

3.1.2. Emissions Balance of SAF Produced from Colombian CPO

The HEFA process inventories are based on information from technical and scientific literature; consequently, they may not accurately reflect industrial performance.

Figure 6 shows the emission balance of the palm oil-derived SAF production plant using HEFA technology, including bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel (RD) as byproducts of the process. The process is described in two main stages, each with a distinct impact on carbon emissions. This assessment utilizes carbon footprint data for Colombian CPO as reported by Ramírez-contreras et al. (2024) [22] described in Section 3.1.1. and accounts for an average transport distance of 50 km to the HEFA conversion facility. For the HEFA process, the primary emission contributors are the consumption of natural gas and hydrogen, which are required for both process operations and chemical transformations.

Emission allocation among the resulting biofuels was performed using the following key parameters: a feedstock factor of 0.71 t SAF t−1 CPO (own calculations), a lower calorific value of SAF at 43 MJ kg−1 [13], and an energy allocation factor of 0.8 MJ SAF MJ−1 CPO (own calculation). The first stage, the HEFA conversion unit, integrates several inputs. The most significant of these, in terms of emissions, are natural gas (12.23 g CO2eq MJ−1 SAF) and CPO (5.79 g CO2eq MJ−1 SAF). These raw materials, along with hydrogen, energy, and transportation, are processed to generate a load of 20.01 g CO2eq MJ−1 SAF before moving to the next phase. The second stage is the fractionation unit, where the output stream from the HEFA unit is processed and emissions are assigned. As a result, the palm oil-derived SAF produced exhibited a carbon footprint of 16.11 g CO2eq MJ−1 SAF. This value thoroughly includes the direct LUC emissions associated with Colombian palm cultivation. This value is markedly lower than that of fossil aviation fuel (89.2 g CO2eq MJ−1) and also significantly lower than the SAF footprints reported by Prussi et al. (2021) [4] for Malaysian and Indonesian CPO-derived SAF (37.4 g CO2eq MJ−1 with biogas capture and 60.0 g CO2eq MJ−1 without biogas capture). This analysis illustrates that the selection of raw materials and energy sources is crucial for determining the final product’s emission profile, highlighting the importance of natural gas and CPO in the overall carbon footprint of the process. While hydrogen is a key input in the HEFA route for producing hydrocarbons [13], the variability of its impact on the total SAF emissions directly depends on the hydrogen source, the technology used for its production, and its transportation [44,45]. This reinforces the idea that to achieve truly sustainable SAF production, it is essential to use hydrogen from low or zero-carbon emission sources.

3.1.3. Sensitivity Analysis

To achieve the objectives of the sensitivity analysis, three scenarios were assessed against a defined reference scenario. The reference scenario represents the carbon footprint of SAF produced from Colombian palm oil. This scenario is based on primary data from the Colombian palm oil sector in 2021, collected by the authors during field visits for a previous study [22]. Notably, in 2021, among the 53 surveyed palm oil mills (POM), only 6 reported methane capture through closed lagoons. Scenario 1 enhances the reference scenario’s data by assuming that methane capture is implemented across all surveyed POM. Scenario 2 is based on the reference scenario’s data but excludes all direct LUC emissions. Scenario 3 combines the conditions of Scenario 2 (i.e., without direct LUC emissions) with the inclusion of methane capture from all surveyed POM.

Figure 7 illustrates the combined results for the three HEFA-derived products—SAF, renewable diesel, and bionaphtha—across the reference scenario and the three assessed scenarios. Notably, for the reference scenario, 16.11 g CO2eq MJ−1 is the reported carbon footprint values for the HEFA process products This value is assigned to SAF and its co-products, such as bio-naphtha and renewable diesel. These values incorporate the DLUC associated with Colombian crude palm oil production and methane emissions reported by the surveyed palm oil mills (POMs) (6 POMs with closed ponds and 47 POMs with open ponds). Assuming methane capture for all POMs, as reported in Scenario 1, results in a carbon footprint −4.58 g CO2eq MJ−1 for HEFA products. This outcome is crucial as it highlights that the DLUC emissions from palm oil cultivation in Colombia are favorable, supporting CPO’s potential eligibility as a feedstock for sustainable fuel production.

Conversely, when evaluating the results without considering the DLUC from palm cultivation, the HEFA products exhibit GHG emission values 47.46 g CO2eq MJ−1. Comparing this data with that reported in the reference scenario confirms the significant contribution of DLUC to the carbon footprint. Emissions values in Scenario 3 demonstrate a decrease compared to Scenario 2, indicating that methane capture is also a key low-carbon practice for mitigating the environmental impact of sustainable fuel production, as specified by the CORSIA methodology [31].

According to CORSIA methodologies [9], when a calculation for DLUC yields a negative value—indicating an enhancement in carbon stocks such as soil organic carbon sequestration or biomass sequestration in agricultural plantations, this contribution is subject to verification under the same criteria as CORSIA Emissions Units. Methodologies for accounting for these negative DLUC sources must be submitted to and approved by the CORSIA Sustainability Certification Scheme Evaluation Group. The calculation is performed using only these approved methodologies, even if the negative DLUC value is ultimately lower than the ILUC value assigned by CORSIA.

For the palm oil sector, CORSIA’s methodology addresses the treatment of Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) lagoons and their associated impact on GHG emissions [31]. Specifically, methane (CH4) emissions arising from the anaerobic degradation of organic matter in POME ponds are a key consideration. The default methane emission factor for open POME ponds is established at 155 gCH4 m3 of POME [31]. CORSIA emphasizes that for palm oil production, implementing methane capture and utilization systems (e.g., covered lagoons or digesters) can lead to a significant reduction in these emissions. This distinction is reflected in CORSIA’s default LCA values for palm oil HEFA; (i) HEFA with methane capture has an average value of 37.4 g CO2eq MJ−1, whereas (ii) HEFA without methane capture has an average value of 60.0 g CO2eq MJ−1 [31]. Therefore, the CORSIA methodology formally recognizes closed lagoons as a technology that effectively reduces methane emissions from POME, directly influencing the carbon footprint calculation (as part of the core LCA) associated with palm oil production.

3.2. Analysis of Economic Aspects

This study compares two main business models for SAF production in Colombia, each with a distinct investment and profitability profile. For the raw material, a distribution was considered in which CPO constitutes 80% of the total. UCO accounts for 5%, while POME-oil and other fats make up the remaining 15%. The associated prices for these raw materials were established as follows: CPO: $1066 USD/ton, UCO: $1115 USD/ton, and POME-oil and other fats: $1018 USD/ton. It is important to note that the CPO price corresponds to the 2021 average national price. For their part, the prices of UCO and POME-oil were based on a reference price from October 2021, from which $180 USD/ton was deducted for freight and export costs. For the calculation model, it was assumed that all these prices would remain fixed throughout all years of the analysis.

The first scenario, building a new, independent plant, requires a total CAPEX estimated at $431.3 million USD. Despite the substantial investment, the economic projection is favorable, with an IRR of 16.9% and an NPV of $90.3 million USD. The investment payback period is projected to be 4 years. In contrast, the conversion of an existing refinery proves to be a more capital-efficient model. The required CAPEX is only $223.1 million USD, which is nearly half the cost of a new plant. This scenario’s profitability is significantly higher, with an IRR of 35.7% and an NPV of $276.2 million USD. The payback period is reduced to 3 years, making it the most attractive financial option.

The project’s profitability is highly sensitive to fluctuations in SAF sale prices and the costs of raw materials and energy. The study focuses on analyzing the impact of these variables on the IRR for the new plant scenario. For SAF prices, a ±2% variation in the sale prices of palm SAF and Class II fuels has a direct impact on the IRR. For instance, a 2% increase in prices could raise the IRR to 17.9%, while a 2% decrease could reduce it to 14.5%. The cost of raw materials constitutes a significant portion (70%) of total costs. The prices of CPO and used cooking oil (UCO) have a critical influence. A −2% decrease in these prices could increase the IRR to 21.8%, whereas a +5% increase in UCO prices could reduce it to 13.3%. Although natural gas and electricity costs represent smaller percentages of total costs (4% and 3%, respectively), they also affect the project’s viability. A 100% increase in natural gas or electricity costs could reduce the IRR to 16.1% and 17.8%, respectively. This economic analysis demonstrates that investing in SAF production from palm oil in Colombia is a sound decision, especially under the refinery conversion scenario. However, the project’s profitability is intrinsically linked to market price volatility, highlighting the need for careful risk management.

Our findings align with the study by Gómez et al. (2023) [46], which indicated that implementing SAF production in Colombia is feasible, though it involves some challenges that need to be addressed. The study used the PESTEL framework (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal) to assess the country’s SAF development. It showed that although SAF is currently more costly than fossil fuels, its transaction cost depends on key factors such as the availability and price of raw materials, logistics, technology maturity, and regulatory environment. The study identified several viable technologies with production costs below $1 USD per liter, including HEFA, gasification with Fischer-Tropsch (FT), alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) conversion, and co-hydroprocessing in conventional refineries. Co-processing was highlighted as an appealing short-term option, given that Ecopetrol’s Cartagena refinery already has the necessary infrastructure for efficient production. Furthermore, Colombia’s lower carbon tax on aviation fuel (around $5 USD per ton) compared to countries like the Netherlands ($45 USD per ton) could offer a significant competitive advantage in SAF deployment. The report emphasizes that an initial phase with unregulated prices could motivate market supply [46].

3.3. Analysis of Regulations for Renewable Fuels

ICAO’s role and the CORSIA scheme

Under the guidance of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the aviation industry has prioritized the adoption of SAF to mitigate its environmental impact. To this end, ICAO has established the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), implemented as a key regulatory mechanism to reduce carbon emissions from international flights and contribute to global climate change mitigation efforts [47]. It is anticipated that the CORSIA scheme, in conjunction with SAF utilization, could facilitate a 65% reduction in GHG emissions within the aviation industry. However, the successful adoption of CORSIA by ICAO member airlines is a priority for meeting market expectations and requires robust national-level initiatives that foster SAF production and adoption within individual member states’ air operations. This is particularly critical given the rapid growth in the sector; in 2022, the aviation industry’s emissions were estimated at 800 megatons (Mt) CO2, encompassing domestic and international flights, with a projected increase to over 1000 Mt CO2 annually by 2025 [48].

Global policy frameworks and mandates

The overarching policy initiatives align with respective jurisdictional frameworks, such as the RED II for the EU and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for the United States (U.S.). The “ReFuelEU Aviation” agreement, published by the European Union in 2023, establishes a significant, phased mandate for SAF incorporation into aviation operations. This mandate targets a progression from 2% SAF supply in 2025 to 70% by 2050, complemented by synthetic fuel blends [49]. In parallel, the U.S. has launched a fiscal policy and subsidy program specifically aimed at scaling up SAF production to 3 billion gallons by 2030, operating within the federal incentive framework [50]. Furthermore, state-level initiatives in the U.S. provide further incentives for SAF and drop-in renewable diesel fuel development. In Asia, Japan has notably proposed a 10% SAF mandate for aircraft operations by 2030 [51], while the Civil Aviation Administration of China has initiated a pilot program for SAF supply in aircraft operated by three national airlines [52].

In an analysis of regulatory frameworks for biofuel production, the USA. Clean Fuels Production Tax Credit (45Z), enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act, represents a significant policy shift [53]. Unlike previous programs that targeted fuel blenders, this credit directly incentivizes producers of low-carbon intensity (CI) transportation fuels, including biodiesel, renewable diesel, and SAF. The amount of the credit is tied to the fuel’s lifecycle GHG emissions, as determined by a CI score. To calculate this score, producers are mandated to use the 45ZCF-GREET model, with CORSIA methodologies also permissible for SAF [53]. This credit not only promotes decarbonization in the transport sector but also signals a strategic alignment with agricultural policy. The guidance from the U.S. Treasury proposes incorporating the benefits of climate-smart agricultural practices into the CI calculation, which could further lower a fuel’s score and financially reward farmers adopting these sustainable methods. Overall, the 45Z credit is a key mechanism for the U.S. to drive a cleaner energy transition while fostering domestic agricultural innovation.

Sustainability criteria and certification

The European Commission has formally acknowledged 15 biofuel certification schemes, including the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC-EU) and the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB RED EU). Furthermore, the CORSIA program explicitly recognizes these two entities as authorized agents for certifying SAF under the ISCC CORSIA and RSB ICAO CORSIA schemes. This dual recognition across different regulatory frameworks underscores their critical role in ensuring the sustainability and traceability of biofuels in the global market.

Both CORSIA and REDII stipulate that only direct LUC occurring post-1 January 2008, are considered [9,54]. Furthermore, they mandate that feedstocks must be derived from land not designated as high-carbon stock, protected, or of high biodiversity value. Accurate calculations of LUC emissions are also a prerequisite for compliance. In the context of biofuel regulations, the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) initially classified palm oil as a feedstock with a high risk of direct LUC, linking its production to the conversion of carbon-rich lands, such as forests and peatlands [54,55]. Consequently, the directive mandated a progressive phase-out of biofuels derived from high-LUC-risk feedstocks, with a complete cessation planned by 2030 [56]. This policy has been further reinforced by RED III, which consolidates the disincentive framework for crop-based biofuels [57]. In line with the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, RED III explicitly prohibits the use of crop-based oils, including palm oil and soy, for SAF production while prioritizing advanced and low-risk biofuels, such as used cooking oil and animal fats [49].

With the recent implementation of RED III, which entered into force in 2023, the European Union has significantly raised its renewable energy ambitions, increasing the binding overall target from RED II’s 32% to at least 42.5% by 2030 [57]. This heightened ambition in RED III translates to even stricter sustainability criteria and a greater push for genuinely low-carbon biofuels. While the core principles of DLUC assessment and productivity enhancement remain, RED III emphasizes preventing deforestation and peatland conversion.

CORSIA includes an exemption for feedstocks designated as low-risk for land-use change (Low-risk-LUC), provided they originate from cultivation practices that demonstrate enhanced productivity. Examples of these practices include improved irrigation techniques, intercropping, and mechanical enhancements. When this type of certification is obtained, the ILUC factor is assigned a null value (0), thereby reflecting its non-competitive stance against food crop cultivation [9]. It is imperative to note that the eligibility cut-off date for this modality is 1 January 2016, which makes practices implemented before this date ineligible for certification. The ILUC LCA value is established by ICAO on a country-by-country basis, corresponding to the feedstock’s country of origin. For instance, while the ILUC LCA value for Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil is 39.1 [9], ICAO has not yet defined this value for Colombian palm oil.

The CORSIA methodology for SAF production assesses a raw material’s sustainability based on its environmental performance rather than on its inherent classification as “good” or “bad” [9]. The methodology includes detailed procedures to calculate the life cycle emissions of any eligible feedstock, including those with low LUC risk, such as waste, residues, and by-products, and those from yield-increasing approaches. Consequently, the key determinant of sustainability is the environmental performance of the entire supply chain and its contribution to reducing GHG emissions from global aviation, not the raw material itself. This approach provides a neutral, science-based method for evaluating the sustainability of any eligible feedstock, regardless of its origin.

Colombia’s role in sustainable palm oil certification

It is important to recognize that within Colombia’s distinctive agricultural landscape, a raw material might be considered low-risk for direct LUC if its cultivation employed productivity-boosting methods different from conventional practices or if it was grown on previously degraded or underused land. So far, the Colombian palm oil industry has shown a strong commitment to sustainability schemes, with 26.3% of its CPO production certified by recognized programs like ISCC, RSPO, and the Rainforest Alliance in 2021 [20]. This dedication has opened new opportunities, such as certifying raw material production under the ISCC CORSIA scheme using the “yield increase approach”. This method is described as a land management practice that allows feedstock producers to boost the amount of crops they grow within a fixed land area, without expanding the cultivated land [9]. It is achieved through better agricultural practices, intercropping, sequential cropping, or reducing post-harvest losses. In this context, it is remarkable that two Colombian companies, Gremca S.A. and Alianza del Humea S.A.S., have already obtained this certification. Gremca S.A. became the first palm oil company worldwide to do so, proving its ability to produce palm oil that meets the strict international standards for SAF manufacturing, as guided by the ICAO’s CORSIA program [58]. Later, Alianza del Humea S.A.S. became the second palm oil company globally to receive the same certification [59].

Beyond its attainment of CORSIA certification, the Colombian company Gremca S.A. has become the first palm oil producer in the world to achieve “deforestation-free” certification under the ISCC-EUDR standard [60]. This achievement marks a milestone for the palm oil industry, demonstrating the viability of sustainable production practices and positioning Colombia as a leader in responsible agriculture [60,61]. The ISCC-EUDR certification is especially important for accessing the European market, as it meets the requirements of the EU’s Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which aims to ensure that products imported into the EU are not linked to recent deforestation.

Based on the sustainability certifications achieved by Colombian palm oil companies, the possibility is strengthened that palm oil can be used as a sustainable raw material not only for SAF production but also for any other product that requires demonstrating the sustainable sourcing of its raw materials. Oil palm in Colombia has the potential to gain access to regulated markets due to efforts to expand oil palm cultivation in available areas, areas without high carbon stocks or high biodiversity [25,62,63]. Furthermore, renewal is moving towards oil palm interspecific O × G hybrids, which have proven to have higher productivity compared to the commercial Elaeis guineensis cultivar.

3.4. Analysis of Market Access Opportunities

Worldwide, air travel and tourism contributed 10.3% to the 2019 Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In the Latin America and Caribbean region, this contribution was significantly higher, at approximately 22.1%, highlighting the indispensable role of air transport in fostering regional and international connectivity [12]. In Colombia, air tourism accounts for over 85% of domestic travel [12], suggesting a substantial market opportunity for SAF adoption by airlines. While airlines are actively pursuing increased SAF integration to achieve carbon emission reduction and sustainability objectives, current market dynamics are characterized by limited production volumes and the cost-competitiveness of traditional fossil fuels [11].

Colombia faces a critical challenge: boosting SAF and renewable diesel production. This is essential to meet domestic biofuel demand, lessen reliance on imports, and strengthen the national economy. Developing SAF would contribute to strengthening the agriculture sector, create jobs, and support an economy centered on environmental services [64]. Colombia has a strong potential for SAF production, with an estimated production of at least 100 million gallons by 2035 and 450 million gallons by 2050 [64]. In the country, the palm oil sector has significant potential as a raw material supplier for SAF and RD production, due to its competitive advantages, namely: (i) a demonstrated commitment to sustainability, evidenced by the sector’s adoption of sustainable agricultural methodologies and dedication to forest conservation; (ii) a strategic geographic positioning within Latin America, facilitating regional SAF distribution; (iii) a low carbon footprint, with Colombian palm oil production exhibiting a significantly reduced carbon intensity (182 kg CO2eq t−1 CPO) compared to international counterparts (5 t CO2eq t−1 CPO); (iv) ample land resources suitable for oil palm cultivation; and (v) superior per-hectare productivity relative to alternative oilseed crops [20]. Furthermore, the sector’s adherence to a non-deforestation policy, corroborated by recent satellite monitoring data indicating 99% deforestation-free palm oil cultivation [36], is pivotal for biofuel sustainability certification, particularly concerning feedstock origin.

While the domestic utilization of SAF and renewable diesel offers potential for national economic enhancement, the export of SAF to European and United States markets represents a particularly significant strategic opportunity. In Europe, the incorporation of biofuel blends into conventional fossil fuels constitutes a central regulatory strategy for reducing GHG emissions and promoting renewable energy adoption. Specifically, Directive (EU) 2018/2001 mandates that Member States ensure a minimum 14% share of renewable energy across all transport modalities by 2030 [55].

In the United States, a memorandum of understanding among federal agencies, including the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Department of Agriculture (USDA), has been established to formulate a holistic strategy. This strategy aims at cost reduction, sustainability enhancement, and the expansion of SAF production and deployment. This framework sets targets, including a minimum 50% reduction in life-cycle GHG emissions compared to conventional fuels, a domestic SAF production goal of 3 billion gallons per annum by 2030, and 35 billion gallons to satisfy 100% domestic demand by 2050 [50]. Consequently, a projected increase in global SAF demand is anticipated. Furthermore, CORSIA, implemented by IATA to promote SAF utilization in global aviation operations, plays a crucial role in incentivizing the production and adoption of these biofuels for GHG emission reduction within the aviation sector [9].

4. Discussion

The results of this study demonstrate the sustainability of the national crude palm oil (CPO) production chain. To further improve the CPO’s carbon footprint, it is essential to implement low-carbon practices tailored to each crop and each POM around the country. However, a holistic approach to decarbonizing SAF production transcends mere feedstock considerations; it demands integrating strategies based on the circular bioeconomy models across the entire lifecycle value chain.

For instance, in the HEFA process, natural gas and hydrogen utilization represent significant sources of GHG emissions. A potential mitigation strategy involves the robust integration of biorefinery systems within the palm oil sector. This could entail replacing natural gas with biogas obtained directly from POME treatment systems. Moreover, green hydrogen could be produced using surplus energy or biomass generated during CPO extraction. These strategies would not only enhance the GHG emissions performance of SAF produced from Colombian palm oil but would also reinforce the sustainability of the palm oil sector within the framework of the global energy transition.

To enable the advancement of SAF within Colombia and secure its access to international markets, the adoption of rigorous sustainability certification standards across the CPO supply chain is indispensable. Regulatory frameworks such as CORSIA and RED II, and increasingly RED III, serve as crucial instruments for validating economic, social, and environmental sustainability, thereby substantiating the legitimacy of raw material sourcing. Nevertheless, the commercial viability of biofuels derived from vegetable oils or biomass necessitate enhanced public engagement, technological innovation, strategic policy interventions, and infrastructural development to bolster production capacities effectively.

Beyond sustainability and policy considerations, the identification and evaluation of technologies for transforming raw materials into SAF are crucial for achieving demonstrable GHG emission reductions, as evidenced by carbon savings relative to reference fossil fuels [65]. The demonstrated sustainability in the Colombian CPO production chain, supported by certification mechanisms and the availability of suitable land (over 3 million hectares) for palm cultivation [66], strategically positions the country for developing a biofuel production strategy.

Water use is a key element for the sustainability of the palm oil sector. In Colombia, with its diverse climate and topography and facing an increase in intense drought and rainfall due to climate change, the palm oil sector has adopted and innovated efficient irrigation systems [20]. These systems are designed to adapt to the particular conditions of different palm-growing regions, aiming to mitigate adverse effects on crops. The sector, in collaboration with Cenipalma, supports key projects like the Palm Water Security Project and the Strategy for Sector Involvement in Watershed Management to improve water governance [20]. This management is based on Colombia’s hierarchical hydrographic structure, which facilitates coordinated planning for water conservation.

The Colombian palm oil sector’s sustainability strategy is built upon three key pillars. First, the “Sustainable Origin Colombia” pillar highlights the country’s unique attributes, with 32% of its crude palm oil production and cultivated area already certified under sustainability standards, including its own APSColombia certification. Second, the Environmental Performance pillar underscores a strong commitment to zero deforestation, confirmed by real-time satellite monitoring showing 99% of crops are deforestation-free. The sector is also implementing low-carbon practices, such as leveraging biomass for composting and biogas capture, which presents significant potential for advanced biofuel markets. Finally, the Social Performance pillar focuses on community development, evidenced by an 86% formal employment rate, fair wages, and a gender equity policy that has increased direct female employment by 17.5% [20,30].

This unique standing allows Colombia to distinguish itself from other prominent producers such as Indonesia and Malaysia. Furthermore, Colombia benefits from a strong national network of universities and specialized research centers that actively foster the generation of innovative solutions and facilitate the crucial technical-economic feasibility assessment of advanced biofuel production.

5. Conclusions

This research comprehensively evaluated Colombia’s crude palm oil (CPO)-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production chain. Our analysis focused on a detailed carbon footprint assessment, a review of renewable fuel regulations concerning carbon intensity, economic aspects and an exploration of market access opportunities for low-CO2 emission raw materials.

Carbon footprint assessment

Extending the carbon footprint analysis to fuel production, SAF processed via the HEFA pathway from Colombian CPO yielded a value of 16.11 g CO2eq MJ−1 SAF, which includes direct LUC emissions. This value represents a substantial reduction compared to the fossil aviation fuel reference standard of 89.2 g CO2eq MJ−1. Furthermore, it demonstrates a lower carbon intensity than SAF produced from CPO in Malaysia and Indonesia (37.4 g CO2eq MJ−1 SAF with biogas capture and 60.0 g CO2eq MJ−1 SAF without biogas capture). A sensitivity analysis underscored the critical drivers of this low carbon intensity. While the baseline SAF carbon footprint is 16.11 g CO2eq MJ−1, reflecting current DLUC emissions and existing methane capture practices, comprehensive methane capture across all surveyed mills could reduce the values to negative −4.58 g CO2eq MJ−1.

Conversely, excluding DLUC emissions from the assessment significantly increased the carbon footprint to 474.6 g CO2eq MJ−1, thereby highlighting Colombia’s favorable DLUC profile as a major factor in its remarkably low overall CPO carbon footprint. This analysis confirms that both effective direct LUC management and robust methane capture are paramount for achieving exceptionally low carbon intensities in Colombian CPO-derived SAF, a practice critical for reducing the environmental impact of sustainable fuel production as outlined by the CORSIA methodology.

Market opportunities and strategic leadership

The presented research demonstrates that Colombia has a significant and promising role to play in the global market for SAF. By leveraging its abundant agricultural resources, particularly oil palm, and its commitment to robust sustainability certification schemes like ISCC and RSB, the country is well-positioned to become a key player in the decarbonization of the aviation industry. The successful certifications of Colombian companies, such as Gremca S.A. and Alianza del Humea S.A.S., under both CORSIA and the new ISCC-EUDR deforestation-free standard, underscore the viability of a sustainable and traceable supply chain. Colombia’s proactive approach to sustainability and its demonstrated capacity to meet stringent international standards position it as a vital contributor to a cleaner energy transition in aviation.

Currently, as an initial option, the conversion of an existing refinery is the most financially viable short-term option for producing SAF from palm oil in Colombia, with a 35.7% IRR and a 3-year investment payback period. This model outperforms building a new plant, which highlights the importance of capital efficiency and market volatility management. However, to fully realize this potential, a broader strategic vision is needed. Future research should explore a number of critical areas to strengthen the understanding of SAF production in Colombia. This could include economic optimization studies, expansion of feedstock analysis, and assessment of alternative technologies.

Challenges and outlook

The overarching challenge for Colombia now lies in scaling up SAF and renewable diesel production to meet domestic biofuel demand, reduce import dependence, and strengthen the national economy. However, it is vital to recognize that achieving economic viability for biofuels derived from vegetable oils and biomass requires broader public adoption, continuous innovation, supportive policy incentives, and substantial infrastructure development to augment production capacity.

Abstract

The deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) is central to decarbonizing aviation. However, diverse regulatory frameworks create complexity for SAF market deployment. Differing greenhouse gas (GHG)-reduction thresholds, feedstock eligibility rules and certification systems increase the compliance burden, especially for those operating across regional and international markets. This paper compares an example of regional approach (European) with the international ICAO sustainability certification. The comparison focuses on chain-of-custody models, substantiality principles, GHG accounting methodologies and approaches to ILUC. It highlights the need for harmonized GHG calculation rules, mutual recognition of certification schemes and interoperable traceability systems. Aligning these elements is critical for reducing administrative barriers, supporting market integration and enabling scalable SAF deployment. The analysis aims to assist policymakers, certifiers and producers in developing coordinated and transparent regulatory strategies.

1. Introduction

The decarbonization of the aviation sector is becoming a central priority for the industry [1] and many regions, such the European Union, the UK [2], India and Brasil [3], among others [4], are setting specific sector strategies to meet climate neutrality targets by 2050 [5]. At the European level, the EU Green Deal, together with sector-specific legislation such as the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation [6] and the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III), aims to operationalize the deployment of SAFs within the broader context of energy and transport decarbonization.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) are considered one of the key enablers of this transition, as they offer a significant reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to conventional jet fuels (Jet A1) [7]. Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) are non-conventional aviation fuels derived from non-fossil sources. While the term SAF is widely used, other designations such as sustainable alternative fuel, renewable jet fuel or bio jet fuel are often used interchangeably.

SAFs are produced from a variety of renewable resources [8], including waste oils, agricultural residues, municipal solid waste and even renewable electricity combined with captured CO2, depending on the production pathway (Figure 1). SAFs are considered ”drop-in” fuels, meaning they can be blended with fossil Jet A or Jet A-1 and used without modifications to existing aircraft engines or fuelling infrastructure. The environmental benefit of SAF arises primarily from its potential to reduce net CO2 emissions, depending on the feedstock and production process, as well as its ability to displace fossil fuels [9].

To be used in commercial aviation, an SAF must pass rigorous technical, safety and performance evaluations. This process is governed by ASTM International [10], particularly through the ASTM D4054 and ASTM D7566 standards. ASTM D4054 outlines the protocol for evaluating and certifying new jet fuel formulations, including laboratory tests, rig tests, engine tests and fleet evaluation. If a candidate fuel meets all necessary performance criteria, it is then considered for inclusion under ASTM D7566, the specification for aviation turbine fuels containing synthesized hydrocarbons. Once listed in ASTM D7566, the SAF is recognized as safe for use when blended with fossil jet fuel up to a certified limit—typically 50%, although this may vary depending on the specific pathway. Certified fuels under ASTM D7566 are deemed equivalent to Jet A or Jet A-1 and are thus fully fungible with existing fuel supply chains. This harmonized certification framework is critical not only for ensuring the safety and reliability of aviation operations but also for enabling the commercialization of SAF technologies by allowing them to integrate seamlessly into global fuel-distribution systems.

Currently approved conversion pathways for SAF are defined by three key elements:

the specific conversion process;

the applicable ASTM annex or equivalent standard;

a technical description of the pathway and its associated feedstocks or synthesis routes.

The first category includes Fischer–Tropsch (FT) pathways, such as Gasification FT and CO2 FT. These thermochemical processes convert carbon-rich materials—like biomass, coal or captured CO2—into syngas, which is subsequently processed into synthetic paraffinic kerosene (FT-SPK). Certified under Annex A1 of ASTM D7566, these fuels are approved for blending up to 50% with conventional Jet-A due to their excellent performance characteristics.

The Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway, covered by Annex A2, is the most commercially established SAF technology. It uses renewable lipids (e.g., vegetable oils, used cooking oil, and animal fats), converting them to SPK via hydrogenation and deoxygenation [11]. HEFA-SPK currently represents the dominant share of SAF production globally.

The Synthesized Iso-Paraffins (SIP) pathway, certified under Annex A3, involves hydroprocessing of fermented sugars. Although technically viable, SIP-SPK is limited to a 10% blend ratio due to its lack of aromatic hydrocarbons, which are essential for compatibility with older aircraft fuel systems.

FT-SKA, listed in Annex A4, is a variant of the FT process that includes the production of synthetic aromatics via alkylation. This enables the fuel to meet aromatic content currently required by Jet A1 specifications [12].

Annex A5 includes multiple Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ-SPK) fuels, produced from alcohols such as ethanol, isobutanol or isobutene through dehydration, oligomerization and hydroprocessing. The ATJ platform offers feedstock flexibility but faces limitations due to the complexity of upgrading and the cost of bio-alcohol production.

Catalytic Hydrothermolysis Jet (CHJ), certified under Annex A6, employs hydrothermal liquefaction to convert wet biomass or oils into an intermediate oil, which is then upgraded catalytically to jet fuel. This method enables the use of high-moisture feedstocks with minimal preprocessing.

The HC-HEFA-SPK route (Annex A7) expands the traditional HEFA platform by using hydrocarbon-based esters and fatty acids, while ATJ-SKA (Annex A8) integrates alcohol synthesis with aromatic production to meet full-specification jet fuel requirements, addressing the aromatic deficiency of standard ATJ-SPK.

In addition to these standalone pathways, ASTM D1655 permits the co-processing of renewable feedstocks—such as esters, FT intermediates or HEFA precursors—within conventional petroleum refineries [13]. These co-processing options offer a cost-effective and scalable interim solution by leveraging existing refinery assets [14]. However, they require rigorous traceability to ensure that the biogenic portion is properly quantified and recognized in sustainability programs such as CORSIA.

Apart from the quality aspects, to be classified as sustainable, aviation fuels must meet a set of established criteria, including significant life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and the exclusion of feedstocks sourced from land with high carbon stock or biodiversity value. The sustainability of SAFs is strongly influenced by the feedstock utilized for their production, as reported by [15] in a recent review, the large-scale biomass cultivation may lead to indirect land-use change, increased water demand and potential negative impacts on biodiversity. Crucial is the proper design of the whole SAF supply chain; Mohammadi et al. [16] highlighted that integrating decentralized processing with optimized logistics creates a resilient, low-emission biomass supply chain that balances economic efficiency with environmental sustainability. The need to carefully consider the SAF supply chain has also been stressed by Liang et al. [17]: the review highlights that SAF production depends on coordinated management of feedstock sourcing, conversion technology, transportation logistics and airport demand to balance cost, emissions and reliability. The study of Liang et al. concluded that integrating advanced modeling, decentralized processing and supportive policies are essential elements for SAF to become a sustainably scalable alternative to fossil jet fuel.

To address this complexity, sustainability frameworks for alternative fuels have been developed over recent decades for road applications and subsequently extended to other transport modes. In the USA, the biofuel certification framework relies on voluntary, third-party verification systems to ensure that biofuels meet high standards of quality, environmental protection and social responsibility. Programs like BQ-9000, which accredits biodiesel producers and marketers based on ASTM D6751 standards, emphasize rigorous quality control across storage, blending and distribution. Meanwhile, international schemes such as the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) can be used to verify sustainability, traceability and greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions across complex supply chains. Independent audits and adherence to detailed benchmarks provide transparency, signal responsible production to consumers and foster a market that rewards sustainable biofuels, thereby strengthening the growth of a low-carbon energy sector.

In Brazil, the RenovaBio policy serves as the primary framework for biofuel certification, aimed at promoting renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [18]. Managed by the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP), the program certifies production units through an efficiency assessment conducted by accredited firms using the RenovaCalc tool. Certified producers receive a Certificate of Efficient Production of Biofuels, which enables them to issue decarbonization credits (CBIOs). These credits are traded on Brazil’s B3 stock exchange, creating a market mechanism that compels fossil fuel distributors to meet national emission-reduction targets. By assigning energy-environmental efficiency ratings and facilitating a financial market for low-carbon fuels, RenovaBio supports the decarbonization of Brazil’s energy matrix while aligning domestic production with international sustainability standards, such as Bonsucro.

Another relevant example of regional setup is Japan. The country mandates sustainability certification for biomass fuels within its Feed-in Tariff (FIT) system to guarantee that renewable electricity generation is based on environmentally and socially responsible practices. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) recognizes certification schemes such as the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) Japan FIT and the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) Japan FIT, which verify compliance with criteria including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity protection and prevention of deforestation. These schemes require producers and traders to meet sustainability standards, maintain a chain of custody that ensures traceability from origin to power generation and undergo independent verification. Once certified, biomass fuels become eligible for FIT incentives, such as subsidies, thereby enabling producers to access Japan’s renewable energy support system while promoting responsible production and sustainable market practices.

As a relevant example of the regional level allowing to investigate the details of these complex processes, the European Union approach, as described in the Renewable Energy Directive and its recasts [19], has paved the way. As of today, sustainability frameworks are implemented through Sustainability Certification Schemes (SCSs), both at the European as well as at the international scale.

A robust sustainability certification system is essential to ensure that SAFs deliver genuine climate benefits, avoid unintended environmental and social impacts and are accounted for consistently across regulatory frameworks [20]. In the European context, sustainability certification is governed by the RED and its associated delegated acts [21,22], which establish strict criteria for GHG savings, feedstock eligibility and traceability. Parallel to this, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has developed the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which includes a global sustainability framework for SAF eligibility and offsetting purposes [23].

Although both frameworks share a commitment to sustainability, they differ in scope, criteria and implementation. These divergences have practical implications for SAF producers operating in both EU and international markets, especially in terms of compliance pathways, certification strategies and investment decisions.

This paper provides a comparative analysis of a regional approach (i.e., European) and ICAO sustainability certification systems applicable to SAFs, with a particular focus on certification schemes, chain of custody models and greenhouse gas accounting methodologies. The goal of this work is to support SAF producers and policymakers in navigating this complex regulatory landscape and to identify areas for potential harmonization or alignment.

2. Chain of Custody and Traceability

A critical component of sustainability certification systems is the ability to trace the origin and characteristics of sustainable fuels throughout the supply chain. This is accomplished through Chain of Custody (CoC) models, which define how sustainability information is transmitted along the production and distribution process (Figure 2).

Three main CoC models are used across schemes: Identity Preservation (IP), Segregation (SG) and Mass Balance (MB).

2.1. Identity Preservation (IP)

Identity Preservation is the most stringent CoC model. It ensures that certified products remain entirely segregated from non-certified materials throughout the entire supply chain. Each batch is uniquely traceable back to a specific production site and feedstock lot. While this model guarantees the highest level of traceability and consumer confidence, it is operationally complex and rarely used in fuel supply chains due to cost and logistical constraints.

2.2. Segregation (SG)

Segregation allows certified materials to be pooled with other certified materials, but only if they are certified to the same standard. No mixing with non-certified materials is permitted. This approach ensures that certified output can be confidently attributed to sustainable input, while offering greater flexibility. Documentation under SG must ensure traceability of batches and compliance with certification thresholds.

2.3. Mass Balance (MB)

The Mass Balance approach is the most widely used CoC model in SAF certification. It allows certified and non-certified materials to be physically mixed at any stage in the supply chain, provided that:

the quantities of certified inputs and outputs are reconciled over a defined time period (e.g., monthly or quarterly);

the sustainability characteristics (e.g., GHG emissions savings, feedstock type) are tracked and recorded administratively;

certified output does not exceed the volume or energy content of certified input.

Mass Balance offers a pragmatic solution that supports scalability while maintaining environmental integrity. It is explicitly recognized under Article 30 of RED III [19] and is accepted in the CORSIA framework. Some certification schemes allow for additional constraints (e.g., geographic scope or processing step-level tracking) to enhance assurance.

2.4. Book and Claim

The “Book and Claim” system is a chain of custody model designed to enable the decoupling of physical product delivery from sustainability claims, offering flexibility in how sustainable products, such as SAF, are marketed and consumed. In this system, SAF producers generate certificates (or “claims”) for the sustainability attributes of a given volume of SAF, which are then sold separately from the physical fuel. The actual SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel and enters the general supply chain without being directly allocated to any specific buyer. Instead, airlines or other end users purchase these certificates to claim the environmental benefits of SAF usage, even if the physical fuel is not used in their own operations.

According to various sources (e.g., [24]), this approach enables greater scalability and market access for SAF, especially in cases where logistical or infrastructure constraints prevent physical delivery to certain locations. It also supports early investment and demand signals for SAF production, by allowing buyers in hard-to-reach regions or with lower volumes to contribute to the decarbonization of aviation. Importantly, the environmental integrity of the Book and Claim system relies on robust traceability mechanisms, independent third-party verification and registries that prevent double-counting and ensure transparency in the transaction of sustainability attributes.

When a “Book and Claim” model aligns with international principles for credible chain of custody systems, it can be considered as a complementary mechanism to physical chain of custody models (such as Mass Balance or segregation). As a relevant example, Brazil embraces the Book and Claim accounting system, enabling fuel decarbonization through verified emissions credits even if the physical SAF is not consumed at the point of sale [25].

While CORSIA does not specifically touch on the Book and Claim issue, ICAO considers the adoption of such approaches, noting that chain-of-custody tools like Book and Claim or Mass Balance systems can unlock efficiency and broader uptake by enabling sustainability claims to travel independently of fuel flows [26]. Likewise, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) has already registered its first Book and Claim Unit (BCU) for co-processed SAFs [27].

At the EU level, Article 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation) obliges the European Commission to evaluate whether additional measures should complement the weighted average approach used by aviation fuel suppliers when providing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at EU airports. Among the options under consideration is a tradability system, such as a “Book and Claim” mechanism, for aircraft operators and/or fuel suppliers, designed to facilitate SAF supply and uptake. As of today, a final decision about the implementation of such measures has not yet been made public.

2.5. Relevance for SAF Certification

Under ReFuelEU Aviation, all SAF volumes counted toward compliance targets must be certified using traceable CoC systems. Most SAFs in the EU market today are certified using Mass Balance, reflecting the need to integrate SAFs into existing infrastructure and blend them with fossil jet fuel (Jet A-1) before distribution [6].

While ICAO allows SAF producers to use any CoC model approved by the certification scheme, it places significant emphasis on documentation, volume reconciliation and the integrity of sustainability claims. Potential needs for dual compliance with both EU and CORSIA systems often requires producers to ensure that their CoC model can satisfy the more stringent of the two frameworks.

As the SAF market matures, there is increasing interest in harmonizing CoC requirements to facilitate trade, reduce audit burden and ensure interoperability between voluntary schemes. Until then, careful design of CoC systems remains a strategic priority for producers and auditors alike.

3. Sustainability-Certification Frameworks

3.1. The EU Sustainability Framework

The European Union’s regulatory approach to sustainability certification of alternative fuels is governed by the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), currently in its third revision (RED III) [19]. RED III establishes mandatory sustainability and greenhouse gas (GHG) criteria for biofuels, bioliquids, biomass fuels, renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) and recycled carbon fuels (RCFs). Fulfilment of these criteria is essential for eligibility toward renewable energy targets and access to market incentives.

To operationalize certification, the EU recognizes a series of voluntary Sustainability Certification Schemes (SCSs), such as ISCC EU and RSB EU RED, under Article 30 of the Directive [28]. These schemes must demonstrate conformity with specific EU-recognized principles and verification protocols and they serve as third-party mechanisms to ensure compliance across the fuel-production chain. The schemes check that the fuel producer respects the sustainability criteria set under the EU context, in particular that:

the production of feedstock for these fuels does not take place on land with high biodiversity;

the land with a high amount of carbon has not been converted for such feedstock production;

the biofuel, bioliquid and biomass fuel production leads to sufficient greenhouse gas emissions savings.

To qualify as sustainable, an SAF must demonstrate at least a 70% GHG reduction compared to the fossil comparator baseline of 94 gCO2eq/MJ [21]. Compliance is assessed through harmonized life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies, as set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/1185. Certification bodies verify this reduction through detailed data reporting, including input quantities, energy use, emissions factors and transport distances.

In the RED III, there is a clear differentiation of feedstock categories. Only advanced biofuels—derived from feedstocks listed in Annex IX Part A—along with RCFs and RFNBOs, qualify toward the aviation blending mandates specified in the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation [6]. Biofuels originating from food or feed crops are explicitly excluded from eligibility as part of the EU’s strategy to avoid indirect land-use change (ILUC) impacts.

The background of the ILUC concept is related to the possibility that biofuel production may trigger the need for additional land to cover the feed and food demand, indirectly pushing for a change in the current use of land with potential related CO2 emissions. To address the issue of ILUC in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package, the revised renewable energy directive introduces a risk-based approach: it sets limits on high ILUC-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels with a significant expansion in land with high carbon stock. These limits will affect the amount of the fuels that Member States can count towards their national targets when calculating the overall national share of renewables and the share of renewables in transport. The directive also introduces an exemption from these limits for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels certified as low ILUC risk. For the implementation of this approach, as required by the directive, the Commission adopted the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/807. It has to be highlighted that, conversely from other approaches (i.e., CORSIA), ILUC is not calculated under REDII.

Differently from biogenic feedstock-derived SAFs, Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) have different sustainability criteria to meet. RFNBOs (also referred to as Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels, e-fuels or synthetic fuels) are central to the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation [6], which mandates a progressive incorporation of SAFs, starting at 2% in 2025 and increasing to 70% by 2050. A specific sub-target for synthetic fuels (i.e., RFNBOs) sets minimum blend shares of 0.7% in 2030 and 1.2% in 2032. This underlines the EU’s commitment to promoting synthetic fuels that can reduce dependency on crop-based biofuels and scale SAF supply through electrification pathways.

The current EU framework, complemented by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/1184, sets strict conditions for the electricity used in RFNBO production. This includes the core principles of:

Additionality —electricity must originate from newly built renewable energy installations, to avoid harmful renewable energy displacement effects;

Temporal correlation—electricity consumption and generation must align within the same month (until 2029) and on an hourly basis thereafter;

Geographical correlation—electricity must be produced within the same bidding zone as the RFNBO facility.

Multiple sourcing scenarios are recognized to determine when electricity qualifies as “fully renewable”:

Direct connection to a renewable installation with no grid draw;

Grid-based sourcing in zones exceeding 90% renewable electricity share;

Use of grid electricity with emission intensity < 18 gCO2eq/MJ, combined with Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), cancelled Guarantees of Origin (GoOs) and correlation requirements;

Electricity-mitigating redispatch of renewable capacity (with operator verification).

Importantly, storage installations cannot be counted as renewable generators. Although renewable electricity sources do not require certification themselves, the RFNBO producer must provide robust documentation demonstrating full compliance with these conditions during certification audits.

RFNBOs are also subject to a minimum 70% GHG savings threshold, calculated using harmonized life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies [21]. To meet this, producers must not only track the energy source, but also account for transport emissions, and process energy use and carbon inputs.

Regarding carbon sources, the CO2 used for RFNBO synthesis can originate from:

Industrial waste streams, if subject to carbon pricing (e.g., EU ETS);

Biogenic sources, such as emissions from biofuel fermentation;

Atmospheric capture or geological sources, including geothermal CO2.

Fossil-based CO2 may be used only until 2035 and must not be intentionally generated for the sole purpose of fuel production. Fuels derived from intentionally generated fossil CO2 are not classified as RFNBOs.

Closely related to RFNBOs are Recycled Carbon Fuels (RCFs), also regulated under the same Delegated Acts. While RCFs originate from non-renewable waste streams and do not contribute to the EU-wide renewable energy share, they may count toward national transport targets if they achieve >70% GHG savings and are derived from unavoidable industrial by-products. To qualify, these waste gases must not be intentionally diverted for fuel production.

Together, RFNBOs and RCFs constitute the synthetic fuel categories positioned to complement bio-based SAFs in achieving the EU’s aviation decarbonization and climate neutrality goals.

Beyond environmental performance, RED III also enforces social and traceability criteria (e.g., [29]). Economic operators must demonstrate:

Legal land use and no conversion of high-carbon or high-biodiversity areas.

Respect for human rights and labor standards.

Compliance with applicable laws in feedstock origin regions.

Transparent documentation from point of origin to final fuel production.

Traceability is implemented through mandatory chain of custody systems, among these, Mass Balance is the predominant model used in fuel certification due to its practicality. RED III mandates that the Mass Balance system be robust, documented and subject to third-party audits, which include on-site inspections, record verification and risk-based sampling [29].

Certification bodies approved under voluntary schemes must follow detailed auditing protocols, ensure auditor competence and apply sanctions for non-compliance. Audits cover not only conversion facilities but also upstream operators including farms, collection points, warehouses and transport operators.

The EU’s multi-level certification architecture is designed to ensure credibility, transparency and environmental integrity and is continuously updated to reflect evolving sustainability science and geopolitical priorities. For SAF producers, understanding and implementing RED III-compliant systems is a prerequisite for participation in the EU renewable fuels market.

To facilitate harmonized implementation, the European Commission maintains a registry of recognized certification schemes, which must be renewed every five years [30]. These schemes must demonstrate transparency, reliability, auditor competence and full traceability of certified volumes.

3.2. The ICAO CORSIA Framework

At the international level, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), is the primary instrument guiding sustainability criteria for aviation fuels [23].

The framework defines three main categories of fuels:

CORSIA Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs)—renewable or waste-derived fuels meeting the full set of sustainability criteria.

CORSIA Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAFs)—fossil-derived fuels that meet GHG criteria and some sustainability safeguards.

CORSIA Eligible Fuels (CEFs)—the umbrella term encompassing both SAFs and LCAFs.

CORSIA establishes sustainability criteria that alternative fuels must meet to be recognized as CORSIA Eligible Fuels (CEFs). These criteria include both environmental and social safeguards. In particular, for a fuel to qualify as a CORSIA Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), it must achieve at least 10% GHG emissions savings compared to the baseline fossil jet fuel and must not be produced from biomass sourced from land with high carbon stock or high biodiversity [23].

While GHG thresholds under CORSIA are initially lower than those in the EU RED III, the framework is designed to be progressively strengthened. From 2027 onward, participation in CORSIA becomes mandatory for most ICAO Member States and the sustainability criteria include additional social and environmental dimensions, such as labor rights, water use and biodiversity [23].

A distinguishing feature of the CORSIA sustainability framework is its explicit inclusion of indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions in life cycle assessment (LCA) calculations. ILUC refers to the displacement of existing land use—typically food or feed production—caused by the expansion of land dedicated to biofuel feedstock cultivation. ICAO provides predetermined ILUC emission factors for eligible fuel-production pathways, based on global economic modelling tools such as GTAP-BIO [31] and GLOBIOM [32].

In addition, CORSIA permits a zero ILUC factor for SAFs produced using low-ILUC-risk feedstocks or practices. These include:

Use of agricultural, industrial or municipal waste and residues.

Cultivation of energy crops on degraded, marginal or unused land.

Implementation of yield-increasing practices that avoid land expansion.

By integrating ILUC considerations into its fuel accounting, CORSIA aims to avoid unintended negative consequences of SAF expansion and ensure that life cycle GHG savings are robust and verifiable. However, growing concerns are expressed by stakeholders, with respect to this quantitavie approach to ILUC [33].

Beyond greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, the CORSIA sustainability-certification framework mandates compliance with a broader set of sustainability criteria. These criteria are verified during the certification of fuel producers and their supply chain operators, to ensure that Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) are eligible.

CORSIA requires that SAF producers demonstrate adherence to social, environmental and economic safeguards, including but not limited to protection of biodiversity, soil and water resources, food security, land-use rights and respect for human and labor rights. These aspects align with the definitions and structure set forth by ISO 13065 “Sustainability criteria for bioenergy” [34], which CORSIA references to structure its sustainability framework.

Accordingly, sustainability is organized into three hierarchical components (Table 1):

Sustainability themes, which refer to broad areas of concern, such as water quality and availability.

Sustainability objectives, which specify the desired outcome within each theme, e.g., fuel production should maintain or enhance water quality and availability.

Sustainability indicators, which define measurable or observable criteria, such as the implementation of practices that ensure efficient water use and prevent the depletion of surface or groundwater resources beyond natural replenishment rates.

The ICAO’s CORSIA framework defines 14 sustainability themes that must be addressed for a fuel to be considered a CORSIA Eligible Fuel (CEF) (Figure 3). These themes are grouped into three main categories: carbon reduction, environmental and socio-economic. Each theme is supported by a specific principle ensuring that fuel production contributes to climate mitigation, environmental protection and social responsibility. These themes provide a comprehensive framework that ensures that CORSIA Eligible Fuels are not only effective in reducing aviation-related emissions but also contribute to broader goals of environmental protection and social equity.

Compliance with these sustainability elements is assessed through third-party audits carried out by CORSIA-approved Sustainability Certification Schemes (SCSs).

Certification under CORSIA is performed by schemes approved by ICAO, which assess fuel batches for compliance with sustainability, traceability and GHG performance criteria. These schemes must adhere to ICAO’s guidance on life cycle assessment (LCA), which specifies the use of a well-to-wake boundary for emissions accounting [35]. As of today, three schemes are approved: ISCC CORSIA [36], RSB [37] and ClassNK [38].

This structured and standards-based approach enables CORSIA to promote not only climate mitigation but also holistic sustainability in the global deployment of alternative aviation fuels.

3.3. Comparison of EU and ICAO Requirements

The European Union (EU) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through its CORSIA framework have both established systems to certify the sustainability of alternative aviation fuels. While they share the overarching goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from aviation by promoting sustainable fuels, their approaches differ in structure, scope, criteria and implementation mechanisms (Table 2). These differences have significant implications for fuel producers seeking recognition under both regimes.

3.3.1. Regulatory Scope and Legal Structure

The EU sustainability framework for fuels is anchored in binding legislation through the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III), supported by delegated and implementing acts that specify methodological details and compliance requirements. This legislative architecture applies to all EU Member States and is deeply embedded within the broader EU climate and energy policy (e.g., ReFuelEU Aviation).

In contrast, CORSIA operates as an international market-based mechanism under the auspices of ICAO, agreed upon by its Member States. Its legal character is less binding and relies on voluntary commitments transitioning to mandatory participation over time (phased implementation through 2027–2035). CORSIA defines eligibility rules for fuels used to offset international aviation emissions but does not directly regulate blending obligations or national targets.

3.3.2. GHG Accounting and Emissions Thresholds

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) accounting is a crucial step in assessing the sustainability of SAF production. A recently published global bibliometric analysis by Li et al. [39] on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) highlighted how the field has become a key framework for greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting and climate policy. The authors show that LCA research has grown almost exponentially since 2000, with strong focus on quantifying carbon footprints, global warming potential and other GHG metrics as core indicators of environmental performance. Keyword trend analysis reveals an increasing emphasis on carbon footprint, greenhouse gas emissions and climate change as central themes, reflecting a shift from purely methodological debates to application-driven studies that inform low-carbon strategies across sectors. Specifically about SAF, the study by Zhang et al. [40] expands the discussion of life cycle assessment (LCA) and GHG accounting by applying these methods specifically to bioenergy and aviation fuel pathways. It emphasizes that accurate greenhouse gas inventories require cradle-to-grave system boundaries, inclusion of upstream land-use change emissions and careful allocation of co-products to avoid underestimating climate impacts. The study shows how feedstock variability, transport distances and conversion efficiencies drive most of the carbon footprint and compares alternative supply chain configurations to reveal opportunities for lowering emissions through optimized logistics and renewable energy inputs. It also highlights that harmonized datasets and transparent uncertainty treatment are critical for ensuring comparability of SAF GHG results across regions and technologies, reinforcing earlier bibliometric findings that data quality and methodological consistency remain key barriers to reliable, policy-relevant LCA.

This studies highlight the need for a harmonized accounting methodology and clear thresholds for defining sustainability elements. As anticipated, both EU and ICAO frameworks defined specific GHG accounting methodologies; RED III mandates a minimum of 70% GHG savings compared to a fossil fuel comparator of 94 gCO2eq/MJ for all fuels eligible under the aviation blending mandate. The GHG performance is calculated using harmonized life cycle assessment (LCA) rules laid out in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/1185. These rules specify inputs, emissions factors, transport stages and co-processing methods in a consistent format applicable across Member States.

CORSIA, by contrast, requires a lower threshold: a minimum of 10% GHG savings compared to conventional jet fuel (89 gCO2eq/MJ) but it includes ILUC. The GHG calculations under CORSIA follow a “well-to-wake” boundary and rely on default or actual values, based on ICAO-approved methodologies [35].

3.3.3. Feedstock Eligibility and Fuel Classification

Under RED III, only fuels produced from specific feedstock categories are eligible for compliance, particularly advanced biofuels (Annex IX Part A). Conventional biofuels from food or feed crops are excluded from aviation targets. RFNBOs must meet strict conditions related to electricity sourcing (e.g., additionality, temporal/geographical correlation), while RCFs must be derived from unavoidable industrial waste streams.

CORSIA adopts a broader definition of eligible fuels. It allows the use of a wider range of feedstocks, provided they meet sustainability criteria related to land use, carbon stock and social safeguards. The following are CORSIA Eligible Fuels (CEFs): SAFs and Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAFs), each with specific sustainability elements.

A practical example of illustrating the implication of the differences among the international and regional approaches is the use of food crops. Produced on extensive areas and with high agricultural mechanization, in many regions, these feedstocks fully aligned with the HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) conversion pathway and they are compatible with coprocessing in existing refineries. Certified under ASTM D7566 and supported by traceability frameworks, vegetable oils offer a robust, scalable short-term feedstock for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). However, while these are fully compatible with the ICAO scheme, they cannot be used to produce SAF for the EU market.

3.3.4. Treatment of Indirect Land-Use Change (ILUC)

One of the most notable differences lies in how the two systems address indirect land-use change (ILUC). CORSIA explicitly incorporates ILUC into its LCA framework using model-based default values from GTAP-BIO and GLOBIOM. It also recognizes “low-ILUC-risk” practices that qualify for a zero ILUC factor, such as use of waste/residues or production on degraded land.

By contrast, ILUC is not quantified in RED III’s GHG calculations. Instead, the EU uses a risk-based regulatory approach. High-ILUC-risk fuels (e.g., derived from palm) are not allowed against aviation targets, while low-ILUC-risk biofuels, demonstrated through improved agricultural practices, are exempt from these restrictions.

In the EU context, there are specific provisions to exclude high-risk feedstock, such as palm oil. While this is not the case in CORSIA, it is worth noticing that the default ILCU value implies the potential risk of this feedstock, resulting in a fairly high value: 39.1 gCO2e/MJfuel.

This distinction underscores a philosophical divergence: CORSIA quantifies ILUC, whereas the EU controls it via supply-side restrictions and delegated regulation (e.g., EU 2019/807). It is worth noticing that the International Maritime Organization (IMO) decided to adopt, for its marine fuels LCA guidelines [41], a risk-based approach.

3.3.5. Sustainability Criteria and Social Safeguards

Both systems go beyond GHG performance to include social and environmental sustainability. RED III requires compliance with a wide range of sustainability principles, including protection of high-carbon-stock lands, legal land use, respect for human rights and traceability throughout the supply chain.

CORSIA similarly mandates sustainability safeguards, grouping them into broad themes such as water, land, labor and social development. These themes are operationalized through objectives and measurable indicators. These requirements must be verified through approved Sustainability Certification Schemes (SCSs), which independently assess compliance. For example, in relation to human and labor rights, CORSIA requires that all production respects workers’ rights and ensures fair treatment. Under the theme of land-use rights, producers must respect both formal and informal land tenure, including indigenous and customary rights. Similarly, water-use rights must be safeguarded, with certification confirming that local and indigenous communities’ prior or customary access to water is upheld. Beyond resource rights, CORSIA integrates broader social objectives: production activities should support local and social development by improving socio-economic conditions in regions affected by poverty, while also safeguarding food security by ensuring that biofuel production in food-insecure areas does not undermine, and ideally enhances, local food availability. Together, these safeguards covering human, environmental and social dimensions establish a comprehensive sustainability framework, ensuring that aviation fuels under CORSIA contribute to emissions reductions without causing unintended negative impacts.

3.4. Data-Reporting Systems

The European Union has established the Union Database (UDB) [42], a centralized digital platform designed to monitor the life cycle and sustainability of biofuels and Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs). The UDB records transactions across the supply chain to prevent double counting, supports the implementation of Mass Balance chain of custody systems and enables verification of compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction requirements under the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). All certified parties, including economic operators, voluntary schemes and certification bodies, are mandated to submit data, thereby ensuring traceability across national borders and throughout the supply chain.

In parallel, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has developed the CORSIA Central Registry [43], which is used to track emissions, offsetting obligations and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) usage by aircraft operators. The registry collects data through the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) process, as submitted by national authorities. This includes details on the volume and characteristics of CORSIA-eligible fuels used by airlines. However, unlike the EU UDB, the CORSIA Registry does not record transaction-level data across the supply chain. Its primary function is emissions accounting and monitoring SAF uptake, rather than ensuring supply chain traceability.

While the EU UDB offers granular, transaction-level data for both fuels and feedstocks to support robust traceability and sustainability verification, the CORSIA Registry focuses more on aggregated emissions data and SAF deployment by operators, with limited emphasis on supply chain-level reporting.

4. Policy Implications

The evolving landscape of sustainability certification for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) presents both regulatory challenges and market opportunities for producers operating regionally (e.g., European Union) and internationally [44].

One of the key challenges faced by SAF producers is navigating divergent sustainability criteria and certification requirements. The EU imposes stringent greenhouse gas (GHG)-reduction thresholds (≥70% for RFNBOs and RCFs) and feedstock restrictions (excluding food and feed crops) [19], whereas CORSIA has lower entry thresholds, ILUC calculation and a broader feedstock eligibility [23]. This dual system may require producers to pursue separate certification pathways, duplicating administrative efforts and increasing compliance costs. The interplay between regional and international initiatives creates a complex environment for operators.

Additionally, the differences in audit cycles, recognition procedures and accepted methodologies for GHG calculations increase the uncertainty and resource burden for SAF producers, particularly for small and emerging players who may lack the institutional capacity to manage multi-scheme compliance.

A move toward harmonization—such as mutual recognition of schemes, alignment of GHG calculation principles or interoperability of digital traceability systems—would reduce duplication and foster greater scalability of SAF deployment. Without convergence, regulatory fragmentation risks undermining the climate credibility, economic efficiency and global trade of sustainable aviation fuels.

4.1. Opportunities and Strategic Levers

Despite the regulatory fragmentation, SAF producers can capitalize on early compliance and dual certification as a market differentiator. Producers who align proactively with both RED III and CORSIA standards are better positioned to access public support mechanisms (e.g., mandates, subsidies, blending quotas, etc.) and to participate in carbon credit schemes and international fuel trade.

The progressive incorporation targets under ReFuelEU Aviation, starting from 2% in 2025 and reaching 70% in 2050, offer a long-term market signal that encourages investment in certified SAF-production capacity [6]. Meanwhile, the evolving stringency of CORSIA post-2027 may close the gap with RED III, enabling certification schemes to converge over time.

The deployment of harmonized digital traceability systems, also presents an opportunity to streamline compliance across jurisdictions, reduce audit costs and enhance transparency for end users and regulators alike.

4.2. Recommendations for Harmonization

To reduce regulatory friction and promote global SAF deployment, several harmonization measures should be considered:

Establish common baseline sustainability criteria for SAFs across regional and CORSIA frameworks, particularly for GHG reduction thresholds, land-use safeguards and social principles.

Promote mutual recognition of certification schemes that demonstrate equivalence in verification, auditing and traceability standards.

Align standardised methodologies for life cycle GHG emissions accounting, including default values and treatment of co-products, etc.

Support digital integration of chain-of-custody systems via interoperable registries and secure, auditable data infrastructure.

Facilitate capacity building for small producers to ensure inclusive access to certification and market participation.

By pursuing regulatory alignment and fostering technical interoperability, both the EU and ICAO can accelerate the deployment of SAFs in line with climate targets, while safeguarding environmental integrity and market transparency.

5. Conclusions

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) play a vital role in achieving decarbonization targets in the aviation sector, both within the European Union and at the global level. Ensuring that SAFs deliver verifiable environmental benefits requires robust and transparent sustainability-certification frameworks. This paper has reviewed and compared two relevant systems currently in place: the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED III), as an example of a regional scheme, and ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

As the SAF market is rapidly evolving, the sustainability certification is a foundational pillar for participating in and benefiting from this transformation. While both frameworks share the common objective and several important methodological approaches, from an SAF producer perspective there are significant operative differences, for instance in their stringency and implementation mechanisms. RED III imposes more rigorous greenhouse gas (GHG) thresholds and restricts feedstock eligibility, while CORSIA allows for broader inclusion with lower initial GHG requirements. These divergences pose challenges for SAF producers, especially those seeking access to both regulatory markets.

A central focus of this analysis has been the role of certification schemes and chain-of-custody models in ensuring compliance. Most SAF producers currently adopt Mass Balance due to its practicality and compatibility with blended fuel infrastructure, though future developments may drive increased use of more granular tracking systems. Book and Claim is currently under discussion, as it potentially facilitates logistics, allowing for a wider adoption of SAF.

Looking forward, greater harmonization between regional and ICAO frameworks is essential to streamline certification efforts, lower administrative barriers and foster cross-border SAF trade. Aligning GHG accounting methods, sustainability safeguards and digital traceability systems would not only benefit producers but also strengthen consumer confidence and policy coherence.

The policy and market momentum behind SAFs is accelerating. Aligning certification requirements and providing consistent regulatory signals will be instrumental in ensuring that SAF deployment meets both climate goals and sustainability standards, while enabling producers to operate competitively at a global scale.

The ten-year Cleaner Fuels Program will support onshore production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, which can replace fossil fuels in existing engines. The first large-scale output is expected by 2029.

Australia already exports nearly $4 billion (US$2.6bn) in feedstocks such as canola and tallow that could be refined locally. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) estimates a mature domestic industry could reach $36 billion (US$23.7bn) by 2050. It also projects that switching to cleaner fuels could avoid about 230 million tonnes of emissions by mid-century – equivalent to the annual output of 86 million cars.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the investment was not only about climate but also about reshaping the economy. “This is a downpayment on developing an entirely new industry in Australia,” he said. “From the farm to the refinery, from primary production to processing, this will create more jobs and more opportunities for Australian workers and businesses.”

Climate and Energy Minister Chris Bowen argued that domestic production offered a pathway to reduce emissions in sectors where electrification remains difficult, such as aviation, shipping and heavy construction. Agriculture Minister Julie Collins said the move would provide new markets for farmers and strengthen regional economies, while Acting Infrastructure Minister Murray Watt pointed to the potential for job growth in transport and logistics.",https://www.mobilityplaza.org/media/cache/640/bundles/app/images/42613/68cd3bc046c49.png,N,,2025-09-19 11:57:43.774302

Regulatory Push: Government Mandates, Incentives and Net-Zero Targets

The aviation industry is under constant pressure, with regulators, investors, and passengers demanding stronger mandates to drive adoption beyond early adopters for a greener way to fly. Government and regulatory bodies are establishing region-specific frameworks to support SAF deployment, each tailored to local feedstock availability, energy policies, and decarbonization priorities.

Aviation Carbon Footprint Reduction: Four Emission Control Scenarios by 2040

Over the next 15 years, SAF will be the primary enabler of carbon footprint reduction in aviation, helping airlines meet near and mid-term net-zero milestones. Airlines are expected to steadily increase SAF utilization from today’s less than 1% of global jet fuel demand to double-digit blending levels by the late 2030s, driven by regulatory mandates in regions such as the EU, U.S., and parts of Asia.

Infrastructure and Supply Chain Hurdles: Saf Production is One Thing, While Distribution at Thousands of Airports Is Another.

Solving the infrastructure and distribution challenges as SAF needs to be produced at refineries, transported, and blended within existing supply chains requires new logistical capabilities and standardized quality control on a global scale. The SAF supply chain will prioritize the development of multimodal transportation networks, including pipelines, shipping routes, and road transportation, out of which pipelines & trucks will facilitate ~70% of SAF transportations globally, till 2040.

Saf Technology Breakthroughs: Multiple Pathways (Hefa, Achtj, Ft, Ptl) are Maturing.

A combination of technologies, operational measures, and market-based mechanisms is expected to shape the pathway to net-zero aviation by 2050. These will deliver the most significant contribution, accounting for 60-65% of total emissions reductions. Looking ahead, SAF through pathways like HEFA, Fischer-Tropsch, Alcohol-to-Jet, and Power-to-Liquid will significantly support aviation’s decarbonization, making it the key factor of sustainable air transport.

Global and Regional Addressable Market: North America Leads With ~40% Share In 2025, With Europe and Asia Catching Up.

According to MarketsandMarkets, the Global Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market size is estimated at USD 2.06 billion in 2025. It is projected to reach USD 25.62 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 65.5%. In terms of volume, the market is projected to grow from 0.30 billion gallons in 2025 to 3.68 billion gallons by 2030.

What’s Holding Saf Back And Expected Moves by 2030?

Availability of aviation biofuel feedstock: Waste oils, fats, residues, and algae are promising, but finite.

Industry partnership and deals: Long-term green aviation fuel production plans and airline deals are the key.

Reducing the SAF vs. Jet Fuel price gap: SAF is still 3–5x more expensive than fossil jet fuel.

In the end, SAF won’t solve the emissions problem of aviation alone. It represents one of the most critical pillars of aviation’s transition toward a net-zero future. It provides the sector with a viable, scalable, and immediate solution to decarbonization while maintaining the performance, reliability, and energy density required for global air transport. SAF, such as biojet fuel, alcohol-to-jet fuel, power-to-liquid jet fuel, will remain the most practical alternative aviation fuel lever for the next decades.

CGF, a wholly owned subsidiary of CATAGEN, will use patented modular reactor technology to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using off-grid renewable/low carbon electricity sources – meaning fuel can continue to be produced consistently, and is flexible and resilient to any fluctuations in grid connectivity.

Marking the launch of CGF, Catagen announced new strategic partnerships with Ryanair and Shell Aviation for offtake agreements of SAF production and use.

CGF production systems will be manufactured off-site and can be deployed close to renewable electricity assets or close to airports where fuel is needed and with minimal disruption to operations.

Steven Fitzgerald, Ryanair director of sustainability and finance, said: ""Progressing towards our sustainability goals depends on securing scalable and affordable SAF.

""CATAGEN’s decentralised SAF model allows production to be brought closer to demand, enabling faster deployment and reducing the bottlenecks that slow down traditional SAF projects.

""We see this as a critical pathway to reducing our emissions while continuing to deliver affordable travel.”

Ken McHutcheon, supply and operations manager at Shell Aviation Ireland, said: ""Shell Aviation is committed to scaling sustainable aviation fuel, but the industry needs both volume and speed.

""CATAGEN’s decentralised, modular approach provides a new way of producing SAF that can complement centralised facilities, shorten timelines, and provide more flexible access to fuel.

""This model has the potential to reduce reliance on imported SAF, increase energy independence, unlock new markets and accelerate the industry’s journey to net zero.”

Mel Courtney, chief executive at ClimaHtech Green Flight, added: ""The UK has a mandate to have 10% of flights using SAF by 2030, with the EU having a 70 per cent target by 2050.

""On current supply, these targets are ambitious, with the International Air Transport Association currently estimating demand surpassing 360 million tonnes by 2050, up from 1 million tonnes that were available in 2024.

“To reach these targets, we need technologies that can be scaled up alongside the development of surrounding infrastructures around airports. In the UK, challenges around energy security have been made clear, hence the push from government to increase our use of renewables in the grid.

""Our approach to SAF should match this approach and be accessible to the market where it is needed to be deployed.”

This project, launched in collaboration with Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), underscores the sector’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Aviation carriers, including Alaska Airlines and American Airlines, are spearheading the project with an initial commitment of $150 million, highlighting the crucial role these airlines play in pushing the boundaries of sustainable travel. SAF’s potential to significantly lower aviation emissions presents an opportunity for industry-wide sustainability advancements.

Efforts like the oneworld BEV Fund have surfaced previously, but this represents a pivotal moment because of the level of airline industry involvement. In past projects, investments in SAF often fell short of industry needs, limiting any considerable scaling benefits. However, with prominent airlines endorsing this venture, there’s a marked shift in how the industry is addressing these ecological challenges.

What Role Do Airlines Play in This Venture?

Airlines are central to the oneworld BEV Fund with multiple companies engaging as key investors. Aside from Alaska Airlines and American Airlines, airlines such as IAG, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, and Singapore Airlines are also contributing. The focus is not solely on monetary assistance; it involves supporting technological advancements for SAF, aiming to make these fuels more accessible and cost-efficient. The initiative reflects a strategic alignment in the aviation industry toward greater ecological responsibility.

How Does SAF Contribute to Emission Reductions?

SAF is primarily made from sustainable resources like waste oils, aiming to drastically cut aviation’s greenhouse gas emissions. Producing SAF addresses the emission issue, though significant scalability challenges exist. High production costs and limited feedstock availability have historically hindered progress. With this new fund, there is hope that addressing these hurdles could lead to broader adoption and improve the ecological footprint of the aviation sector.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts doubling SAF production by 2025, yet it would make up only a small fraction of total airline fuel use. A persistent gap remains, highlighting the necessity for ventures like the oneworld BEV Fund to accelerate SAF’s market presence.

The strategic allocation of resources to solve SAF production issues represents a tactical step by oneworld and its partners. The fund aims to foster innovation, allowing for lifecycle analyses to ensure SAF’s environmental impact is minimized. Multi-year visions align with addressing these systemic challenges, focusing on long-term industry transformation.

An aviation rarity touched down in the Norway's second city of Bergen earlier this month.

Alia had flown 100 miles (160km) in 55 minutes on battery power alone.

Built by US aerospace company Beta Technologies, the electric plane is designed for cargo operations - carrying up to 560kg (half a tonne) loads.

The flight had simulated a planned cargo route between the coastal cities of Stavanger and Bergen, and for the next few months test-flights will be carried out, as part of the country's move towards establishing low-emission aviation.

At the helm was pilot Jeremy Degagne, ""If you do the drive, it's four and a half hours. And we did the flight in 52 minutes.""

""It is an important milestone for Norway as an international test arena,"" says Karianne Helland Strand, a director at Norwegian airport operator, Avinor.

The test-flights in Norway follow a whirlwind European tour, which kicked off in Ireland, and saw Alia debut at the Farnborough and Paris Air Shows, as well as making stops in Germany and Denmark.

Alia can fly up to 400km (250 miles) on a single charge, and refuel in less than 40 minutes by plugging-in, just like an electric car.

The same fixed-wing model can be configured for medical transport or passenger travel with up to five seats, and this June it undertook the first electric demonstration flight carrying passengers into New York's JFK airport.

Beta, which counts Amazon as an investor and UPS as a customer, hopes to get US certification for its plane this year.

""I'm convinced that the next major breakthrough in aerospace will come on the back of electric propulsion,"" says Beta's chief revenue officer Shawn Hall, who's a former fighter pilot.

""We're now able to significantly lower the operating cost and it's environmentally beneficial from a carbon perspective.""

Alia is one of the most advanced projects, among dozens of firms exploring electric propulsion in aviation.

It would be one way of reducing the aviation industry's carbon footprint - which currently accounts for 3% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.

However, the Pipistrel Velis Electro remains the only electric plane to receive full certification from European authorities, despite clearing that hurdle five years ago.

With a range of 185km and 50 minutes of flight time, the Slovenian-built Pipistrel is limited to training and not for shuttling passengers from A to B.

But successes like that have been overshadowed by a string of failures in electric aviation.

Even aviation giant Airbus has backed away from the market. In January it announced that development of its CityAirbus electric aircraft would be put on hold.

Range remains the major limitation to electric flight. Even the best lithium ion batteries are bulky and heavy, with much lower energy density than jet fuel.

They have ""not improved significantly"" over the past two decades, reckons Guy Gratton, an aviation expert and professor at Cranfield University.

For electric flight to take-off, a ""revolution"" in battery chemistry is needed, he says.

Given those limitations, some are looking at alternative technology.

Just as hybrid cars were a stepping stone towards electric vehicles; plane-makers are now also experimenting with hybrid technology.

Among the aviation start-ups trying to get electric passenger planes off the ground, is Heart Aerospace.

It recently shifted its entire operations from Sweden to the US, which its management said would help it focus ""resources"" and be closer to clients, including the airlines Mesa and United.

The firm has developed a 30-seater, prototype plane, the X1, which the BBC saw before it was shipped to the United States.

If all goes to plan during upcoming test-flights, it will become the largest battery-powered plane to fly. ""It has about two tons of batteries in it,"" explained chief technology officer Benjamin Stabler.

For its real-world operations, though, Heart is adopting a fundamentally different design: a hybrid plane, powered by batteries, but carrying fuel as backup.

""You don't need as [many] batteries,"" argues Mr Stabler, which makes it lighter and cheaper, and also allows for more paying passengers.

""For a normal route, it would fly all-electric from takeoff to landing,"" he explained.

""If you want to go a longer distance, or if there's a diversion, you can switch over to the turbines.""

The aircraft could travel 200km in electric-only flight. With the hybrid technology, which is scheduled for test-flights in 2026, it could fly 400km with 30 passengers, or up to 800km with 25, the firm claims.

""Public transport flying, quite rightly, requires a significant amount of energy reserve,"" says Prof Grattan.

""So hybridisation and the use of conventional fuels to carry safety reserves makes good sense,"" adds the professor, who has previously advocated this approach.

It's still not clear what the future of aviation will look like.

Greener fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) have attracted investment, along with hydrogen-based systems.

All will have to prove their commercial viability and safety, and much work needs to be done.

""This is a really challenging thing to do, electrifying aviation and removing the carbon,"" said Mr Stabler.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/99c1/live/f825df80-8d7f-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 20:56:07.863309

The EU ETS is a cap-and-trade system that was launched in 2005.
The European Commission in 2023 amended the EU ETS Directive to help accelerate the use of SAF by granting free EU ETS allowances for use of the fuel.
Starting in 2024, 20 million EU ETS allowances, worth approximately €1.5 billion, are set aside to support SAF uptake.

The EU ETS is a cap-and-trade system that was launched in 2005. The system requires polluters to pay for their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, helping bring overall emissions down while generating revenue to finance a transition to green energy. The program covers emissions from electricity and heat generation, industrial manufacturing, aviation and maritime transport.

The European Commission in 2023 amended the EU ETS Directive to help accelerate the use of SAF by granting free EU ETS allowances for use of the fuel. Starting in 2024, 20 million EU ETS allowances, worth approximately €1.5 billion, are set aside to support SAF uptake.

For 2024, the support amounts to approximately 1.3 million allowances, which are worth approximately €100 million, distributed between 53 operators.

According to the European Commission, the support system covers all or part of the price difference between fossil kerosene and the eligible SAF used by individual commercial aircraft operators on their flights covered by effective carbon pricing through the EU ETS. This support comes on top of the EU ETS incentive for using SAF, as operators are not required to surrender allowances for the use of these fuels – an advantage worth around €25 million in 2024. Taken together, the ETS incentive for use of SAF in 2024 amounts to around €125 million (€100 million from ETS allowances and €25 million from ETS zero rating of sustainable fuels). In addition, the EU ETS finances the Innovation Fund to support innovative clean tech projects, including in the aviation sector, to further reduce its climate impact.

The companies joined Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers MP, Federal Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen MP, Kara Cook MP, Member for Bonner and representatives from the Australian Workers Union, Bioenergy Australia and the National Farmers’ Federation at Ampol’s Lytton Refinery in Queensland for the Sept. 17 announcement.

The new program aims to stimulate private investment in Australian onshore production of lower-carbon liquid fuels, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, according to the Australian government. Australia has the ingredients needed to make cleaner liquid alternatives to fossil fuels, with ready access to feedstocks such as canola, sorghum, sugar and waste.

“Today, around 70% of Australia’s canola is exported unprocessed, with much of it used overseas for renewable fuel production,” said Jesse Scott, head of Agri-Energy for GrainCorp. “We want to bring that value-add home and turn our canola into renewable fuels, to ensure there’s a future made in Australia.

“This project is about using Australia’s strengths in agriculture to fuel a new energy industry – one that helps to cut emissions while driving investment in the regions. As the energy transition gains pace, GrainCorp is proud to be part of this momentum and to help position Australian agriculture as a key player in the solution.”

A global agribusiness, GrainCorp operates the largest grain storage and handling network on the east coast of Australia, operating more than 150 regional receival sites and 20 million tonnes of storage capacity. GrainCorp also operates seven bulk port terminals with up to 15 million tonnes of elevation capacity.

In July 2024, GrainCorp, IFM and Ampol signed a memorandum of understanding to explore the establishment of an integrated renewable fuels supply chain in Australia. This collaboration combines GrainCorp’s feedstock and supply chain capabilities, Ampol’s refining and distribution infrastructure, and IFM’s long-term investment expertise to accelerate the transition to low-carbon liquid fuels.

Under the MOU, Ampol and IFM are assessing the feasibility for a renewable fuels facility with capacity to produce over 750 million liters annually at Ampol’s Lytton Refinery in Brisbane. At the same time, GrainCorp is exploring the feasibility of building a new canola processing facility to supply Australian canola oil to the future plant.

The partners have actively championed supply and demand policy mechanisms to stimulate and foster a robust domestic market for LCLF, which will see the establishment of a new Australian industry and support local jobs.

“Australia has a compelling advantage in infrastructure, technical expertise and availability of raw materials necessary to develop a domestic renewable fuels capability,” said Matt Halliday, managing director for Ampol. “To take advantage of the opportunity in front of us in standing up a domestic renewable fuels industry requires the right government policy and support, so today’s announcement is very much welcomed and an important step forward.”",https://www.world-grain.com/ext/resources/2025/06/16/Biofuels_SCHARFSINN86---STOCK.ADOBE.COM_e.jpg?height=635&t=1750078921&width=1200,N,,2025-09-18 17:56:29.619243

An interview with Robert Chad, Area Manager who oversees France, Belgium, The Netherlands & Southern Europe (Italy, Greece, Cyprus, and Malta), and all our member airlines in these markets *.

·How has the policy focus evolved in your markets since the pandemic?

Many of the markets witnessed a strong resurgence, which was often referred to as “Travel Revenge”. This is a testimony that people view travel as an essential part of their life. We have seen diverse responses in terms of policy making, fromabusive increased airport charges, and imposed noise restrictions (of whichAmsterdam and Brussels are the most emblematic), to efforts in support ofSustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and everything in between. In France, we are witnessing a full spectrum of policies affecting aviation. This includes a 200 million EUR support for Sustainable Aviation Fuel projects, but also the flight ban on routes that can be operated by rail in less than 2h30 (a symbolic measure with little environmental benefit), as well as a significant tax hike. 2025 has also seen a drastic increase of the Solidarity Tax, which further questions the consistency of the government’s approach towards aviation, which is referred to as a “sector of excellence” for the country. But then again, all this is not surprising considering France has boasted five (!) different Transport ministers since the COVID19 pandemic… and we may have a sixth one in the coming days. To that extent, at the end of 2024, we issued and shared a Policy Briefto illustrate the importance of aviation and the necessary steps for the government to take.

·Sustainable Aviation Fuels represent the main solution for the industry to deliver its Fly Net Zero 2050 commitment. What update can you provide, notably on the required sufficient availability and ‘affordable’ pricing, as well as the book and claim system?

All governments in my cluster are now fully aware of this, but responses differ. Some countries have a clear roadmap to reach the 2050 goal, while others are only now setting up decarbonization roundtables to discuss the way forward, and some have neither of these advances in place. From our discussions with policymakers, there is a clear acknowledgement of the need of a Book and Claim system, however some raise the concern of the challenge to effectively control and track the environmental benefit across the process. We need to come up with an optimal solution, as SAF will not be available in all airports, at least not in the coming years. At our last AGM in Delhi, the pricing distortion point was clearly addressed. Many of our members had to pay unreasonable SAF compliance fees due to the current market conditions.

·As of late, we have been witnessing increasing aviation bashing and greenwashing measures from Governments. What actions have you or will you put in place to counter this trend?

The political ‘panic’ response to pressure aviation is risky and can have disastrous effects on the sector and the economy in general. IATA published late last year a series of Value of Aviation reports, which highlight the criticality of the sector for connectivity, economies, and societies. In France, we went one step further by sharing thePolicy Brief with all the Parliament Members to ensure these policymakers acquire a full understanding of the importance of their decisions with regards to our industry.

Airlines are committed to addressing their environmental footprint. This includes “noise”, which is now clear to all policymakers. Unfortunately, after the flight capping at Amsterdam, others such as Brussels have considered following suit, often without applying the necessaryBalanced Approach. Governments should look at the sector with ‘unbiased’ fresh eyes, fully understanding the value and benefits of aviation, the connectivity it provides, and keep in mind that the industry supports 15 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This would facilitate smarter policymaking, stability and consistency.

·Italy represents a best practice when it comes to accessibility, notably with the ‘One Click Away’ project. How can we ensure other countries follow in its footsteps?

This topic is particularly important to me. People deserve to and must travel in a dignified way. This journey starts at the flight search and booking process. Not one stakeholder in all my cluster disagrees with this affirmation. Authorities must serve as ‘sponsors’ -like Italy with ENAC- enabling and facilitating change through platforms and initiatives. We are making advancement in France, and engaged other countries to follow. Airlines are supportive, and many of them have expanded the ‘One Click Away’ initiative to all their websites! From our side, we are engaging all stakeholders (airlines, authorities, airports, associations of disabled persons, association of travel agents, airports …) to explain the concept and facilitate adoption, and IATA played an active role in theINCLAVI (INCLusive AVIation) project which just concluded.

The global avionics industry is undergoing a sweeping transformation, fueled by rapid advances in technology, surging demand for air travel, and aggressive modernization programs across both commercial and military aviation.

Analysts see no slowdown in sight. According to the Business Research Company, the global avionics market is expected to reach about USD 90.5 billion in 2025, up from USD 84.35 billion in 2024, marking a compound annual growth rate of 7.3%.

By 2029, the avionics market is projected to climb to USD 120.72 billion, sustaining a CAGR of 7.5%. The growth underscores the pivotal role of advanced avionics in boosting aircraft performance, efficiency, and safety.

Drivers Behind the Boom

At the heart of this expansion are several converging trends. Technology is leading the way, as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, predictive maintenance, and data analytics reshape how avionics systems function. These tools enable real-time monitoring, smarter decision-making, and more reliable operations.

Airlines and defense organizations are also investing heavily in modernizing their fleets, both to meet strict regulatory standards and to wring more efficiency from fuel consumption. In North America especially, the combination of defense spending and large-scale fleet upgrades has made modernization a defining growth engine.

The global rebound in air traffic is another critical factor, particularly in Asia-Pacific, where surging passenger volumes are driving demand for new aircraft. Military programs add yet another layer of momentum, as governments worldwide ramp up defense capabilities with next-generation avionics, including advanced flight management, communication, and surveillance systems.

Regional Perspectives

North America continues to dominate the market thanks to its robust defense sector and extensive fleet renewal efforts in commercial aviation.

Asia-Pacific, however, is emerging as the fastest-growing region, propelled by strong economic development and soaring demand for both civil and military aircraft.

Europe, meanwhile, is steadily expanding its market share through a combination of regulatory pushes for safety and efficiency and active modernization of its aviation fleets.

Technology Defining the Future

The avionics landscape of tomorrow is being shaped by a series of groundbreaking technologies. Autonomous flight systems are advancing rapidly, promising to reduce human error while improving efficiency and safety.

The rise of electric and hybrid-electric propulsion is also forcing the development of specialized avionics to manage these emerging platforms. With increased connectivity in the cockpit and beyond, cybersecurity has become a top priority, as safeguarding avionics systems against evolving threats is essential to maintaining operational integrity.

At the same time, augmented and virtual reality are finding their way into flight decks and training programs, giving pilots sharper situational awareness and more immersive instruction.

Challenges on the Horizon

Yet even with such a promising outlook, the industry must navigate persistent challenges. Supply chain disruptions continue to affect the timely delivery of critical components.

Regulatory compliance demands constant investment in research and development, as evolving standards require avionics providers to adapt quickly. Integration, too, poses hurdles: marrying new technologies with legacy aircraft systems can be costly and technically complex.

Still, the trajectory remains strong. The global avionics sector is not only growing, it’s redefining the very nature of aviation. With AI, autonomous operations, and electric propulsion pushing the boundaries, the industry is on course for a new era that promises to transform how aircraft fly, how militaries defend, and how passengers experience the skies.

According to IATA leaders Willie Walsh and Mary Owens Thomsen, SAF could account for up to two-thirds of the required emissions reductions. However, current fuel production levels remain far below what is needed.

“We are disappointed by the pace of SAF production,” emphasized IATA Director General Willie Walsh. “At present, the target of 5% SAF usage by 2030 is unlikely to be met. Focus must be placed on stimulating production, because the shortage is not on the demand side, but on the supply side. Airlines have committed to purchasing fuel, showing that demand exists, but production is lagging.”

The situation in Europe and the UK is particularly concerning, where mandates to include 2% SAF in fuel blends have driven up jet fuel prices but have not significantly increased production.

“The money that could be spent on purchasing SAF is effectively boosting fuel suppliers’ profits — this is unacceptable,” Walsh noted.

IATA Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist Mary Owens Thomsen added that there is a significant gap between the expected returns from traditional oil companies and renewable energy projects.

“In the US, some SAF projects have yielded margins over 20%, whereas renewable energy projects generally achieve about 5%. Government support should focus on renewable energy to scale up production of low-carbon fuels, including SAF,” she said.

IATA emphasizes that aviation must have priority access to feedstocks for SAF production. Walsh pointed out that electrification or hybrid technologies only cover short-haul routes, while around 80% of emissions come from flights over 1,500 kilometers. Even the most efficient modern aircraft still rely on liquid fuel, and their operational lifespan can reach 20–25 years.

Thomsen stressed that there is no shortage of feedstock for SAF production — the main obstacles are technological maturity and commercial readiness. “Without accelerating technology deployment through incentives, even available feedstocks will not translate into the necessary production capacity,” she explained.

Regarding potential adjustments to the net-zero targets amid political instability and climate skepticism, Walsh noted that despite challenges and high transition costs, the industry remains committed to its long-term goals. “The technical feasibility of SAF is resolved; now the focus must be on making it commercially viable for the industry,” he said.

Overall, IATA experts urge governments to actively incentivize SAF production, direct support toward renewable energy rather than the traditional oil sector, and ensure fair access for aviation to feedstocks.

Only by taking these measures can the aviation industry implement its carbon reduction strategy and ensure a sustainable future for air transport.",https://www.uzdaily.uz/media/filer_public/f0/b5/f0b5c215-1876-4b97-b92f-39c75bd7f0d9/ask_9907.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 12:57:06.306235

Parallel regulatory shifts are emerging at the regional level. The EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities now includes aviation, introducing metrics like the Global Replacement Ratio to curb fleet growth New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. Meanwhile, the UK is exploring a principles-based green taxonomy to incentivize investments in hard-to-abate sectors New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. These frameworks signal a broader trend: regulators are increasingly tying financial incentives to environmental performance, creating both risks and opportunities for airlines and investors.

Investment Opportunities: Decoding the Sustainable Aviation Ecosystem

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) remains the cornerstone of the industry's decarbonization strategy. With the potential to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, SAF is a critical lever for compliance with regulatory mandates Global emissions deal a priority for airlines at UN aviation assembly |[ 1 ]. Yet, its adoption remains nascent, with less than 1% of global jet fuel currently in use despite 73% of airlines having formal uptake plans New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. This gap underscores a significant investment opportunity.

Public and private funding mechanisms are accelerating SAF's scalability. Governments, including the U.S. and EU, are deploying grants, tax credits, and subsidies through programs like the Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) and the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. Meanwhile, venture capital and private equity firms are stepping in to bridge the innovation gap. Breakthrough Energy Ventures, founded by Bill Gates, has invested in SAF startups such as LanzaTech and Fulcrum BioEnergy, while energy giants like

and are forming strategic partnerships to secure long-term SAF supply chains New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ].

The ICAO's newly launched Finvest Hub further amplifies these efforts by connecting decarbonization projects—particularly SAF production and clean energy infrastructure—with global investors New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. This platform highlights the importance of international collaboration, especially for developing nations, in achieving the industry's 2050 net-zero goals.

Strategic Imperatives for Investors

For investors, the transition to sustainable aviation presents a dual opportunity: mitigating regulatory risks while capitalizing on high-growth sectors. The economic implications of inaction are stark. Studies indicate that airlines could face operational losses if SAF costs are not passed on to passengers, underscoring the need for diversified investment strategies New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. Conversely, early adopters of SAF and clean technologies stand to gain first-mover advantages in a market projected to expand exponentially.

However, the path is not without challenges. SAF's current high costs and limited infrastructure require sustained capital inflows and policy support. Investors must also navigate geopolitical uncertainties, such as the EU's stringent emission caps and the UK's evolving regulatory framework New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. Diversifying portfolios across SAF producers, clean energy infrastructure, and carbon offset platforms can help mitigate these risks.

Conclusion: A Call for Collaborative Action

As the aviation industry gears up for the 2025 UN Assembly, the imperative to invest in sustainable aviation has never been clearer. Regulatory frameworks are tightening, technological innovations are maturing, and financial mechanisms are aligning to support a low-carbon future. For investors, the challenge lies in balancing short-term costs with long-term gains while navigating a rapidly evolving landscape.

The coming year will be decisive. With ICAO's Finvest Hub, the EU Taxonomy, and private-sector partnerships driving momentum, the time to act is now. By channeling capital into sustainable aviation, investors can not only future-proof their portfolios but also play a pivotal role in reshaping the industry's environmental legacy.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1758165806383.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-18 11:56:21.306039

According to Microsoft, the new 5 year agreement “will deliver sustainable AI infrastructure for all of Europe,” to help meet “the exponentially growing demand for efficient, scalable and sustainable AI compute power.”

Microsoft launched a series of “moonshot” sustainability goals in 2020, including commitments to become carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030, as well as to protect more land than it uses by that date. The company’s carbon footprint has grown since 2020, however, driven largely by significant growth in data centers to meet increasing demand for AI computing power, and earlier this year, Microsoft’s Chief Sustainability Officer Melanie Nakagawa acknowledged that the rapid growth of AI has created challenges for the company’s sustainability goals.

In addition to investing heavily in carbon removal solutions, Microsoft has unveiled a series of measures to help address its value chain emissions footprint, including introducing a policy for some of its key suppliers to use 100% carbon-free electricity, and launching a new supplier decarbonization team focused on tackling emissions from cloud and AI operations.

Jon Tinter, President of Business Development and Ventures for Microsoft, said:

“We are incredibly excited for what this means for our customers, in Norway and across Europe, providing the latest and most advanced AI services from Microsoft. It is inspiring to see how Nscale and Aker are building cutting edge, sustainable AI infrastructure, and adding this facility to our comprehensive Microsoft cloud offering in Europe demonstrates our unwavering commitment to customers on the continent.”

The new agreement follows the establishment in July 2025 of a new joint venture between Nscale and Aker to launch “Stargate Norway,” a major AI infrastructure project in Norway, targeting a 100,000 NVIDIA GPUs by the end of 2026, to be powered by renewable energy, and designed to provide secure, scalable, and energy-efficient infrastructure for AI workloads across Europe.

According to the companies, the location of the project was chosen for its abundant hydropower and low local electricity demand, in addition to attributes including the cool climate, and the area’s established industrial infrastructure.

The contract, valued at approximately $6.2 billion, will be delivered in staged deployments beginning in 2026.

Øyvind Eriksen, President & CEO of Aker said:

“This agreement with Microsoft – a long-standing partner to Aker – is a milestone for the joint venture with Nscale and for Norway’s role in enabling sovereign AI infrastructure.

The first production of ‘drop-in’ cleaner fuels, which can be directly substituted for existing fuels and work in today’s engines, is estimated by 2029.

“Australia has the ingredients needed to make cleaner liquid alternatives to fossil fuels, with ready access to feedstocks like canola, sorghum, sugar and waste,” the government said in a statement.

“Thanks to our advanced farming practices and access to cheap and reliable renewable energy, Australia is in an enviable position to produce cleaner, low carbon liquid fuels that jets, ships, construction machines and heavy trucks need to reach net zero.”

Liquid fuels make up around half of Australia’s national energy use. Replacing those fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives would deliver a massive climate and economic opportunity.

The new production-linked incentive builds on the government’s support through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund. Recipients will also need to deliver benefits according to the community benefit principles under the Future Made in Australia Act.

The government is also supporting the market by expanding the Guarantee of Origin Scheme to include low carbon liquid fuels and has established a fuel quality standard for renewable diesel.

Viable propulsion

In December last year, Stralis successfully completed a hydrogen-electric powered propeller spin test on Clyde, a registered six-seat Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft at Brisbane Airport.

The process used high-temperature proton exchange membrane (HT-PEM) fuel cells fuelled by green hydrogen and according to Steffen Geries, Chief Operating Officer at Stralis, it is completely emissions-free.

“Hydrogen electric propulsion uses green hydrogen, produced from renewable sources, which combines with oxygen in a fuel cell to create electricity for an electric motor, with water vapour and heat as the only by-products,” Geries said.

On the back of the successful ground testing, the company is now scaling the technology across multiple aircraft platforms.

“The first larger application will be a 15-seat retrofitted Beechcraft aircraft called B1900D-HE, designed to achieve an 800 km range, but our flagship product will be a 50-seat aircraft for regional aviation, capable of a 3000 km range,” Geries said.

“At this scale, hydrogen-electric propulsion offers its strongest performance and economic advantage – significantly undercutting the operating costs of conventional fossil-fuel aircraft in the same category.”

In the longer term, Stralis sees the potential to scale to even larger aircraft, as electric motors become more powerful and fuel cell systems continue to improve. With ongoing advancements, hydrogen-electric propulsion could extend well beyond the regional market, Geries said.

Importantly, the underlying technology isn’t limited to aviation. HT-PEM fuel cells are well-suited for any application that requires high specific power and is sensitive to weight and volume constraints.

“That includes marine vessels, heavy-duty trucking, portable power systems, and other mobility sectors where clean, lightweight and high-output energy is essential.”

Onboard storage

To get to this point, the engineering team has had to overcome one of the toughest challenges in hydrogen aviation: storage.

“Hydrogen in its gaseous form requires substantial volume, which is an issue for aircraft where space and weight are tightly constrained,” Geries said. “We’ve overcome this by storing the hydrogen on board as a cryogenic liquid at -254°C. This significantly improves energy density by volume and enables longer range capability.”

Liquid hydrogen also offers several advantages over battery-electric flight, he added.

“Where batteries add substantial weight and suffer from limited energy density and long charging times, liquid hydrogen is lighter and supports faster turnaround times. Refuelling is performed by pumping liquid hydrogen into onboard cryogenic tanks.”",https://createdigital.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Stralis.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 08:57:30.183255

The resumed increase in sustainability as a CEO priority comes despite an ESG backlash in the headlines, and as executives increasingly view sustainability from a business value perspective.
The study found, for example, that in 2025, 54% of CEOs linked sustainability to business value, up from only 34% in 2018.
The survey also found a shift in focus for B2B buyers from the sustainability of a supplier’s operations to the sustainability of the supplier’s product offering.
The consumer survey identified cost as the primary barrier to adopting more sustainable practices.","After dropping down the priority list for CEOs, sustainability has once again resumed growing in importance for corporate leaders, who now speak less about sustainability, but increasingly tie it to business value, as consumers and B2B buyers reward businesses for providing sustainable products and services, according to a new survey released by global management consultancy Bain & Company.

Among the key trends highlighted by the report is the importance placed by business to business (B2B) buyers on sustainability factors, with half of those surveyed reporting that they currently spend more with sustainable suppliers, and half also planning to drop suppliers that don’t meet sustainability criteria over the next three years.

While last year’s survey found a decline in CEOs’ prioritization in sustainability relative to other topics as companies shifted from a “hype” phase of setting sustainability commitments to the more difficult process of starting initiatives to reach those goals, the new report indicated that the importance of sustainability for CEOs has bottomed out, and increased for the first time in three years.

The resumed increase in sustainability as a CEO priority comes despite an ESG backlash in the headlines, and as executives increasingly view sustainability from a business value perspective. According to Bain’s analysis of more than 35,000 statements made by CEOs over the past several years, there has been a clear shift in business leaders views of sustainability, from a compliance and moral lens, to one focused on aligning sustainability with core business risks and operational factors. The study found, for example, that in 2025, 54% of CEOs linked sustainability to business value, up from only 34% in 2018.

Despite finding that CEOs are speaking less overall about sustainability, the report also found, however, that companies are ramping their sustainability efforts, with 10% of companies increasing their Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) ambitions, for example, compared with only 4% scaling back, and two thirds of companies on track to achieve their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions targets.

Among the 750 B2B companies surveyed for the report, Bain found that the large majority expect sustainability to have a positive impact on their business over the next three years, and that this belief is particularly strong among companies with year-over-year revenue growth greater than that of their peers, with 90% of these companies agreeing, compared with 60% of other respondents.

As B2B companies increasingly see business value in sustainability, their buying behavior is following suit, according to the survey, which found that 49% of companies are already buying more from their more sustainable suppliers, up from 39% last year, and 68% plan to do so over the next three years. Additionally, 26% of respondents are leaving suppliers that don’t meet their sustainability criteria – while this has declined from last year, 49% expect to do so by 2028, according to the survey.

Additionally, the survey found that more than 80% of B2B buyers paid a premium for their most recent purchase of a sustainable product, and that a third are currently willing to pay more than 5% extra for more sustainable products, while 60% expect to do so in three years.

The survey also found a shift in focus for B2B buyers from the sustainability of a supplier’s operations to the sustainability of the supplier’s product offering. The survey found that buyers expect “sustainability of offers” to increase to become the second top purchasing criteria – behind only “quality” – over the next three years, up from fourth place currently, while “sustainability of suppliers’ operations” is expected to remain unchanged in fifth place.

The report also included a survey of more than 14,000 consumers across 8 countries, finding that 79% reported being concerned about environmental sustainability, a slight decline from the prior year. While the large majority remain concerned about sustainability, the survey found that consumers are adopting a wide range of sustainable practices, including 49% reporting lower energy use, 46% recycling, 41% using reusable products, and 38% buying fewer disposable items. Overall, 32% of respondents reported adopting six or more sustainable habits daily, with 70% wanting to adopt more.

The consumer survey identified cost as the primary barrier to adopting more sustainable practices. In the U.S., for example, while consumers reporting that that they are willing to pay up to a 13% premium for sustainable products, Bain cited New York University data finding that there is a 28% average premium for sustainable products.

In the report, Jean-Charles van den Branden, Leader of Bain’s Global Sustainability practice, and François Faelli, Global Head of Capabilities at Bain said:

“For sustainability, 2025 is the year CEOs turned down the volume—and accelerated action. Sustainability remains a priority. Customers and consumers demand it. Risk and disruption make it essential.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bain.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 08:57:35.360257

Led by cornerstone investors Alaska Airlines and American Airlines, and joined by International Airlines Group (IAG), Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, and Singapore Airlines, the fund signals a major step toward transforming the aviation industry’s fuel supply chain. The initiative marks one of the most significant collective investments in SAF to date, addressing two critical industry challenges: limited availability and high production costs.

Climate Innovation Takes Flight

BEV will act as the fund’s investment manager, bringing its deep technical expertise, rigorous evaluation processes, and a track record of nurturing climate tech startups. The goal: to identify and scale SAF technologies that can deliver real emissions reductions, compete with fossil-based jet fuels on cost, and work seamlessly with today’s aviation infrastructure. “Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to addressing the sector’s environmental impact and represents a major commercial opportunity. The oneworld BEV Fund is built to scale breakthrough SAF technologies with staying power,” said Eric Toone, Chief Technology Officer at Breakthrough Energy and Managing Partner at BEV.

Why SAF Matters Now

Air travel currently accounts for about 2–3% of global CO₂ emissions, but demand for aviation is expected to rise in the coming decades. SAF—fuels made from renewable or waste sources—can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. However, SAF still accounts for less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel use, and the sector has struggled to attract the scale of investment needed to grow. That’s where this fund steps in. The oneworld BEV Fund will prioritize innovations that are not only cleaner but also cost-effective and scalable, helping to build a diverse and resilient supply chain for aviation fuel in the decades to come.

Collective Action Across Alliances

What’s particularly notable is the cross-alliance collaboration. While oneworld member airlines lead the effort, Singapore Airlines, a Star Alliance member, has also invested in the fund—showcasing an industry-wide recognition of the need for climate action. “Reducing the carbon emissions of jet fuel demands collective action,” said Lee Wen Fen, Chief Sustainability Officer at Singapore Airlines. “This investment demonstrates our strong support for driving innovation in next-generation fuels.”

According to Robert Isom, CEO of American Airlines and Chairman of oneworld, the airline and oneworld partners are making a business decision to accelerate the development of novel technologies with the potential to reach larger scale at lower prices by investing in the SAF technologies of the future.",https://storage.googleapis.com/stateless-www-live-traveldailymedia/2023/12/775dcf0a-adobestock_410592669-2100-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-18 08:57:40.508313

American Airlines CEO and oneworld Chairman Robert Isom said:

“We believe reducing the emissions from our operation meets the demands of our customers, will make our business more competitive, and will enable us to continue to deliver the enormous economic benefits of commercial aviation for generations to come.”

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.

According to a recent report by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), however, while SAF production is anticipated to double in 2025, it will still account for just 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption. Efforts to meaningfully increase the production of SAF face barriers including high initial costs and feedstock challenges.

In its announcement of the new fund, oneworld highlighted some of the challenges facing the first generation of SAF, including insufficient investment to date to scale production at competitive prices in line with market needs, as well as concerns around lifecycle environmental impact, adding that the partners in the new fund will focus on supporting new technologies that can scale the availability of cost-competitive SAF, while minimizing other environmental impacts.

Sustainable aviation future","New funding under the EU Emissions Trading System supports 53 airlines in their transition to sustainable aviation fuels

The European Union has taken the following steps toward greener air travel by allocating approximately €100 million in emissions allowances to support airlines that used Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) in 2024.

This move is part of a bigger effort to accelerate the aviation sector’s shift away from fossil fuels and reduce its overall climate impact.

The funding comes from the EU’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the bloc’s flagship carbon market mechanism, and is aimed at closing the cost gap between traditional fossil-based jet fuel and SAF. SAF is a low-carbon alternative that can be integrated with existing aircraft technology and infrastructure, offering significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions throughout its lifecycle.

New support mechanism for airlines

Under the latest amendment to the EU ETS Directive, a new dedicated support system has been introduced to promote the uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuels . Starting in 2024, the EU set aside 20 million emissions allowances, valued at roughly €1.5 billion, for commercial airlines that use SAF on their flights, subject to carbon pricing under the ETS.

For the first year of the scheme, around 1.3 million allowances, equivalent to approximately €100 million at current carbon prices, were distributed among 53 commercial aircraft operators across the EU. These allowances help offset the additional cost of SAF compared to conventional jet fuel, making it a more financially viable option for airlines.

More benefits for SAF users

Airlines using Sustainable Aviation Fuels under the ETS framework benefit in two ways. First, they receive free allowances to help cover the price gap between SAF and fossil kerosene. Second, emissions from SAF are “zero-rated” under the EU ETS, meaning that airlines do not need to surrender carbon allowances for the emissions associated with the use of SAF.

In 2024, the value of this zero-rating is estimated at around €25 million, adding to the €100 million worth of free allowances granted. Combined, the total incentive for SAF usage under the EU ETS this year reaches approximately €125 million.

This financial boost is designed to encourage more operators to switch to Sustainable Aviation Fuels and to increase overall demand, which could eventually help lower prices through economies of scale and supply chain development.

In addition to direct support through allowances, the EU ETS continues to fund the Innovation Fund, which backs cutting-edge clean technology projects, including those in aviation. This multi-pronged approach aims to drive both immediate adoption of SAF and long-term technological change within the industry.

To maintain transparency and ensure accountability, the European Commission has also published a list of all 53 operators that received allowances, along with the quantities allocated to each. This transparency is intended to build trust in the support system and demonstrate the EU’s commitment to fair and effective climate action.

A new report from the London School of Economics warns that an overwhelming majority of corporate climate transition plans lack credibility, with companies continuing to defer meaningful emissions reductions. The study analyzed disclosures from 2,000 publicly traded firms worth $87 trillion and found that only 2% had shifted capital away from high-carbon assets. Moreover, 22% failed basic climate tests, like emissions reporting. While a whopping 95% of companies acknowledge climate change, only 10% demonstrate actual integration into business operations. The report also highlights a growing gap between policy commitments and implementation, with many firms relying on unproven technologies or excluding scope 3 emissions, which are absolutely critical in measuring the carbon impact of a company’s supply chains.

New report uncovers environmental destruction from Chinese gold mines in DRC

A new report from peace group PAX accuses Chinese miners of illegally extracting gold in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), devastating both the natural environment and communities. Backed by Congolese cooperatives and local governments, semi-industrial operations have scarred over 155 miles of waterways, destroyed farmland, and polluted ecosystems with mercury and cyanide. Industrial mining has been damaging the environment in the DRC since the rise in global demand for critical minerals, and this report reveals that existing protections are proving ineffective. Congolese communities are facing health crises, water shortages, and displacement, with devastating reports of children drowning in abandoned mining pits. Researchers warn that the operations are greatly worsening poverty and violence in the region. China, a top gold consumer, denies sanctioning illegal activity by its nationals.

Airlines invest in $150M sustainable aviation fuel fund

Alaska and American Airlines have invested in a $150 million fund managed by Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, aiming to accelerate next-generation sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Also supported by oneworld alliance members, including IAG, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, and Singapore Airlines, the fund seeks to scale alternatives to fossil jet fuel and slowly cut aviation’s 3% share of global emissions. Current SAF supply represents less than 1% of jet fuel production, and costs remain high. Breakthrough Energy is targeting innovative fuels such as engineered algae and hydrogen-based options to drive down costs and unlock large-scale commercial adoption. The biggest challenge lies in scaling production fast enough to meet demand while overcoming cost barriers that keep SAF uncompetitive with conventional jet fuel.

Trump’s push to scrap quarterly reports gains surprising support from ESG investors

Trump’s call to replace quarterly earnings reports with semi-annual updates has drawn unexpected support from sustainability-focused investors. Advocates argue that quarterly reporting promotes short-termism and distracts management from long-term issues such as climate risks. Many European investors believe that reducing the frequency of reporting cycles could strengthen sustainability strategies without compromising transparency, provided that proper safeguards are in place. Critics, however, warn that the need for such safeguards is exactly why the U.S. may not see the same benefits as the EU, Britain, New Zealand, and Australia. U.S. disclosure rules lack equivalents for profit warnings and continuous updates, raising risks for both investors and sustainability.

Changing the fuel specifications for Jet-A/Jet-A1 could possibly be achieved sooner and with less expense than increasing SAF production. Any changes in Jet-A/Jet-A1 specification could be done independently of increasing SAF availability and could be done so as not to interfere with increased SAF usage and should also be considered in this Policy Analysis.

There has been a renewed focus on CORSIA recently after SAF production took center stage from 2021 when aviation’s 2050 goal was agreed to and the quality of some offsetting programs were questioned.
But IATA is putting CORSIA front and center at the ICAO Assembly, with Walsh describing it as the most important issue to be addressed.
IATA wants ICAO states to reaffirm their commitment to making CORSIA the only economic measure to manage aviation’s climate impact and to make available sufficient CORSIA EEUs for airlines to be able to fulfill their CORSIA obligations.
In all, ICAO has accepted 14 working papers from IATA for consideration at the assembly.","IATA’s top executives, including Director General Willie Walsh, have outlined the key issues they will raise at the forthcoming 42nd ICAO Assembly in Montreal, with aviation sustainability at the top of their list.

In a pre-brief for media on Sept. 17, Walsh said it was “critical” to secure stronger support for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and for the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation (CORSIA) agreement that was established at the 39th ICAO Assembly in 2016. These were “key enablers” of aviation’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, Walsh said.

Growing the availability of SAF and making it more affordable have become major goals of IATA in the post-pandemic years, but they also seem increasingly out of reach. Walsh said the problem was “one of supply, not demand,” and he was concerned progress in growing production was not sufficient. Government mandates make fuel companies more profitable rather than putting money into SAF production, a situation Walsh said was “unacceptable.”

IATA will ask ICAO to support its efforts to create a functioning SAF market, step up economic incentives for fuel producers for SAF production, and make policy interventions to address anomalies.

There has been a renewed focus on CORSIA recently after SAF production took center stage from 2021 when aviation’s 2050 goal was agreed to and the quality of some offsetting programs were questioned. But IATA is putting CORSIA front and center at the ICAO Assembly, with Walsh describing it as the most important issue to be addressed. He said the global, market-based measure to address carbon emissions was a “fantastic action” taken in 2016 and needed to be reinforced.

The problem is that states continue to create or augment national and regional aviation taxes and schemes that undercut CORSIA’s credibility. Moreover, only one state, Guyana, has issued CORSIA eligible emissions units (EEUs) which generate climate finance and enable airlines to fulfill their CORSIA obligations.

IATA wants ICAO states to reaffirm their commitment to making CORSIA the only economic measure to manage aviation’s climate impact and to make available sufficient CORSIA EEUs for airlines to be able to fulfill their CORSIA obligations.

IATA SVP sustainability and chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen said offsets were a key lever to achieving net zero. CORSIA offsets are related to certified CO2 emissions reduction projects, mostly in developing countries, and airlines directly help finance those projects.

“It’s a really beneficial program for everybody involved and connects obviously with a global carbon market,” Owens Thomsen said. “Together, we’re building the global climate finance infrastructure by promoting and engaging in this program. But the problem is that there are administrative requirements under the Paris agreement that countries are obliged to do. We need to take these credits off the Paris agreements register and make them available for airlines under ICAO’s CORSIA.”

Additionally, states can opt to sell these credits to airlines, to other countries or to keep them, while airlines are obliged to buy them. “This is all very problematic, and we’re trying to make it easier for the states to release these credits in our favor by hook and by crook,” Owens Thomsen said.

Other issues that IATA will raise at the assembly, which runs from Sept. 23 through Oct. 3, include ignoring a potential revision to how an airline’s corporate tax dues are assessed that would upend the long-applied system of basing those taxes on the airline’s resident base.

There are also some safety-based issues that IATA wants addressed, including reinforcing ICAO Annex 13 that requires a final accident report to be filed within a year of the occurrence. Walsh said that in the case of accidents that occurred between 2018 and 2023, about 43% had yet to file a report. “It’s very important to share those reports to ensure these accidents are not repeated,” Walsh said. “It’s very important that states fulfill their obligations under Annex 13.”

IATA will also ask the assembly to increase the maximum pilot age rule for multi-pilot international operations from 65 to 67, while maintaining the requirement that pilots over 60 have medical examinations every six months. He said this was based on evidence and data that it would not bring any safety risks. The pilots’ union ALPA opposes such a move.

For the industry as a whole and for DHL Group in particular, the next decisive step is to advance the electrification of heavy-duty transport and to make aviation cleaner using modern fleets and sustainable aviation fuels.""

The global postal industry's sustainability measures and objectives

Since 2008, postal companies - key players in the global transport and logistics sector - have been working together on sustainability through the introduction of the Environmental Measurement and Monitoring System (EMMS), followed in 2019 by the Sustainability Measurement and Management System (SMMS). These postal operators have reduced their total annual CO2 emissions by one third and have pledged to cut emissions by 50% by 2030.

The sustainable use of resources has long been a priority for the postal sector in its efforts to minimize environmental impact. The industry is focusing on two key areas: ensuring that postal facilities are increasingly run on renewable electricity, and progressively replacing its global fleet of 600,000 vehicles with alternative vehicles powered by cleaner fuels.

In addition, postal operators are working to cut CO2 emissions in the last mile by expanding the use of delivery vehicles with alternative drive systems. Increasingly, the industry is also focusing on heavy goods transport, where decarbonization is critical to reducing environmental impact. Across the sector, more electric vans and trucks are being added to fleets, while alternative fuels are being tested for air freight. Postal companies are also optimizing truck loading and route planning to further shrink their environmental footprint.

Another key focus is reducing the 1.57 million metric tons of Scope 2 emissions produced annually by postal buildings. Expanding the use of renewable energy will be essential to achieving the industry's 2030 climate targets. A number of postal operators are already making use of solar power, with plans to significantly increase this in the coming years.

Sustainability at DHL Group

DHL Group is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions from 40 million metric tons of CO2e (as of 2021) to less than 29 million by 2030, based on the Science-Based Targets initiative. This will be achieved through various measures, such as gradually increasing the proportion of sustainable fuels (e.g., sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) used across the aircraft fleet or biogas for CNG trucks), further electrification of the delivery and road transport fleet, CO2-neutral building design, and emission-reduced product offerings.

The company also made great strides last year: in 2024, the DHL Group used 74 kilotons of sustainable aviation fuel across its own fleet. This corresponds to a blending ratio of 3.5% in its aircraft - the highest proportion across all airlines worldwide. This year, the Group has increased the number of electric delivery vehicles to 35,000 in its German mail and parcel business alone, making it the largest e-fleet in Europe. 40,000 specially installed charging stations ensure that 95% of the electricity used for charging is green, and 450 CNG (biogas) trucks are used for road transport between parcel centers. Photovoltaic systems, heat pumps, and building automation are used at 160 newly built delivery depots, and 195 buildings are equipped with photovoltaics - with a technically available output of approximately 22 MWp.

The scheme is intended to reduce the price disparity between conventional fossil-based kerosene and SAF, which remains significantly more expensive.

By offering free allowances, the EU is providing operators with a cost offset for each tonne of SAF uplifted on flights subject to ETS carbon pricing.

The Commission noted that this measure builds on existing incentives. Airlines already benefit from not having to surrender allowances for SAF use, an advantage worth an additional €25 million this year.

Combined, the direct allocation of allowances and the zero-rating of SAF under the ETS amount to around €125 million in support for 2024.

A long-term framework

This distribution marks the first application of a broader SAF support mechanism introduced in the recent revision of the EU ETS Directive.

The legislation set aside 20 million allowances – valued at around €1.5 billion at current carbon market prices – to be allocated over the coming years.

Officials hope the framework will give airlines greater confidence to invest in SAF contracts, while also stimulating production across the bloc.

The uptake of SAF currently represents less than 1% of aviation fuel consumption in Europe, despite being one of the few viable near-term solutions for reducing sectoral emissions.

Broader climate investment

Beyond the SAF allocation, the EU ETS also channels revenues into the Innovation Fund, which finances a range of clean technology projects, including in aviation.

The Commission underlined that the SAF incentive sits into this broader effort to decarbonise transport and ensure the sector contributes to Europe’s climate neutrality goals.

Industry implications

While the €100 million allocation offers welcome relief to operators facing high fuel costs, industry leaders stress that long-term SAF affordability will depend on scaling up supply.

The EU’s mechanism is therefore seen as a transitional tool, supporting early adopters while helping build a market for sustainable fuels at a commercial scale.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/09/18/Flight-Emissions-1536x864-1.png,N,,2025-09-18 04:56:08.737373

Rooftop solar: A quick solution stuck in limbo Rooftop solar is among the fastest ways to scale up renewable energy.
These restrictions have discouraged public adoption of rooftop solar, slowing down Indonesia’s progress toward its renewable energy goals.
All this demonstrates that Indonesia has both the capacity and resources to advance renewable energy — so why does it still lean so heavily on imports?
Strengthening multilateral cooperation The biggest challenge in Indonesia’s energy transition is financing.","The year 2025 begins with persistent global geopolitical tensions. The war between Ukraine and Russia drags on, conflict in the Middle East is heating up, and the United States-China trade war continues. All of this could send shockwaves through the global energy market — including in Indonesia.

Indonesia still relies heavily on imported crude oil and natural gas. In 2024, Indonesia spent US$36.28 billion on imported crude oil and natural gas — leaving it highly vulnerable to sudden price hikes caused by war or trade tariffs.

When war broke out in Ukraine in 2022, oil shot past US$100 a barrel — and Indonesia’s subsidy budget ballooned.

These geopolitical tensions should serve as a wake-up call to hasten the transition to renewable energy. Beyond reducing emissions, expanding domestic renewables would cut import dependence and bolster national energy security.

Ironically, Indonesia’s recent diplomacy with the United States (US) has deepened its reliance on imported energy, with President Prabowo Subianto approving US$15 billion (Rp244 trillion) in crude oil and LPG imports in exchange for lower trade tariffs.

These global shocks further expose Indonesia’s deep dependence on imported fossil fuels, making the shift to renewables not just a climate necessity but a strategic imperative for energy security and economic resilience.

Rooftop solar: A quick solution stuck in limbo

Rooftop solar is among the fastest ways to scale up renewable energy. To spur adoption, the government has introduced regulations such as the 2021 rooftop solar grid rule, the 2024 reform and quota regulation, and the 2024 local content rule for solar projects.

However, these regulations have drawn sharp criticism. The 2021 regulation capped the capacity of rooftop solar that could connect to PLN, the state electricity company. Meanwhile, the 2024 quota regulation abolished the net-metering scheme, which had allowed households to offset electricity bills by feeding excess power back into the grid.

These restrictions have discouraged public adoption of rooftop solar, slowing down Indonesia’s progress toward its renewable energy goals.

Australia offers a strong example: it leads the world in rooftop solar adoption through federal subsidies under the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme, complemented by state-level rebates and interest-free loan programs.

As a result, rooftop solar installation costs can be reduced to 70% of market prices, making solar panels affordable for households and small businesses.

Expanding large-scale renewables and infrastructure

Beyond rooftop solar, Indonesia must accelerate large-scale projects like the Cirata Floating Solar Plant, and expand electricity infrastructure for transport and industry.

This is critical given that industry (45.94%) and transport (36.11%) — both account for the bulk of national energy consumption — are still heavily dependent on coal, natural gas, and oil.

Expanding the national grid and building electric vehicle (EV) charging networks are critical for enabling a smooth transition to clean, electricity-based industry and transport.

Scaling up renewable fuel production

Not all sectors can readily switch to electricity; aviation, maritime, and heavy industry will continue to remain reliant on chemical fuels.

Indonesia must also scale up renewable fuel production — including green hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, bioethanol, sustainable aviation fuel, and biodiesel — ensuring they are produced using renewable electricity and sustainable feedstocks, while avoiding deforestation by prioritising waste-based sources.

PLN has begun developing a hydrogen supply chain for industry and fuel-cell vehicles — one of its largest initiatives is the Garuda Green Hydrogen (GH2), a partnership with Saudi energy giant ACWA Power, set to operate in 2026. The hydrogen will be converted into ammonia to support Indonesia’s domestic fertiliser industry.

Other hydrogen projects underway include Gresik Green Hydrogen (ACWA Power and Pupuk Indonesia), Jambi Green Hydrogen (Sembcorp and Transgasindo), Kujang Green Ammonia (Pupuk Indonesia and Fortescue Future Industries), and East Sumba Solar/Fuel Cell (HDF Energy). All projects are scheduled to begin operations between 2026 and 2027.

Indonesia has also begun producing sustainable aviation fuels. State-owned oil company Pertamina’s Cilacap Refinery started output of Bioavtur J2.4 in 2021 — a 2.4% palm oil-based blend with fossil jet fuel — with a capacity of 9,000 barrels per day. The technology was developed by Pertamina Research and Technology Innovation (RTI) and Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) since 2010.

Pertamina is also developing new facilities to produce sustainable fuels — including gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel from used cooking oil — at its refineries in Cilacap, Plaju, and Sungai Gerong.

All this demonstrates that Indonesia has both the capacity and resources to advance renewable energy — so why does it still lean so heavily on imports?

Strengthening multilateral cooperation

The biggest challenge in Indonesia’s energy transition is financing. To address this, Indonesia must strengthen multilateral cooperation, particularly with its Asia-Pacific neighbours, including ASEAN members and Australia.

Incentives like tax holidays can draw in foreign investors, while streamlined licensing reforms will ease the flow of foreign capital.

Funding could also be mobilised through partnerships with global institutions such as the Quad coalition (Australia, India, Japan, and the United States), the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the World Bank.

Indonesia has also agreed to export 3.4 GW of clean electricity to Singapore until 2035, backed by US$30-50 billion in solar investments, plus another US$2.7 billion for solar panel and battery manufacturing.

The program is projected to generate US$4-6 billion in annual foreign exchange revenue.

Pertamina has also supplied SAF to Virgin Australia during the Bali International Air Show on September 18-19, 2024.

By prioritising three key actions — accelerating electrification, advancing renewable fuels, and strengthening multilateral cooperation — Indonesia has a major opportunity to fast-track its energy transition.

Stronger energy security would not only protect Indonesia from global shocks but also lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth in the decades to come.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/686256/original/file-20250819-56-cgbipo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C793%2C9504%2C4752&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-18 02:56:12.376722

By integrating NEXTCHEM’s proven gasification systems, we are strengthening Altalto’s pathway to becoming the UK’s first commercial waste-to-SAF plant. Altalto is alive, advancing, and represents the most near-term opportunity to deliver meaningful volumes of sustainable aviation fuel from waste.”

With the UK’s SAF Mandate requiring 10% of jet fuel demand to be met by sustainable sources by 2030, Altalto stands ready to anchor the nation’s pathway to net-zero aviation.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Altalto-secures-pic-Biofuel-18-9-352883102-768x512.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 02:56:24.302734

The clearest way to boost crop demand is to expand access to higher ethanol blends, especially E15.
That’s why we need Congress to pass the Nationwide Fuel Retailer and Consumer Choice Act this fall, which would finally put E15 fuel regulations on a level playing field with E10.
We agree, and recommended these steps in a recent letter to the president: • Eliminate E15 Misfueling Mitigation Plan requirements.
• Establish a presumption of E15 compatibility for all fuel dispensers, underground storage tank systems, and hanging hardware installed after 1998.","Across America’s heartland, corn farmers have begun to bring in a record harvest—only to face some of the lowest prices in years. They’ve done their job; now Washington needs to do its part. Outdated federal rules—like obsolete pump labeling and unnecessary equipment certifications—are suppressing demand for ethanol and, by extension, undercutting a new market opportunity for our nation’s farmers.

The clearest way to boost crop demand is to expand access to higher ethanol blends, especially E15. Nationwide, year-round E15 availability could create demand for over 2 billion bushels of corn and sorghum, while saving consumers 10–30 cents per gallon at the pump. That’s why we need Congress to pass the Nationwide Fuel Retailer and Consumer Choice Act this fall, which would finally put E15 fuel regulations on a level playing field with E10.

But the need for legislative action goes beyond that. In August, a bipartisan group of senators and representatives introduced the Ethanol for America Act. This bill would require the EPA to finalize a long-stalled rule—first proposed in January 2021—to modernize E15 labeling and equipment standards. Originally proposed at the end of the first Trump administration, the rule sat idle under President Biden. It includes commonsense steps: updating or removing E15 pump labels, allowing flexibility in underground storage tank requirements and ensuring future fuel infrastructure is compatible with higher ethanol blends.

Finalizing this rule should be an easy win—and we urge policymakers and the administration to get the job done as soon as possible. In 2024, President Trump said gas stations should be able to “use the existing pumps” for E15. We agree, and recommended these steps in a recent letter to the president:

• Eliminate E15 Misfueling Mitigation Plan requirements.

• Establish a presumption of E15 compatibility for all fuel dispensers, underground storage tank systems, and hanging hardware installed after 1998. Existing equipment should be deemed compliant with applicable compatibility regulations.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Geoff_Cooper_1fe4338f0c.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 00:56:15.984387
