Low-emissions aviation fuel is available now and is critical to reducing aviation emissions, but existing supply will not grow if suppliers cannot connect with customers.

With philanthropic support, RMI and partners launched a system for accounting for sustainable fuel and a buyers alliance to bridge the gap between buyers and suppliers.

This type of partnership allows new low-carbon products like sustainable aviation fuel to achieve economies of scale and compete with traditional, emissions-intensive counterparts.

Air travel accounts for nearly 2.5 percent of today’s global carbon emissions, and the main culprit is the fossil fuel used to power aircraft.

Innovative fuel suppliers have demonstrated that sustainable aviation fuel made from waste can safely power today’s aircraft. So why hasn’t the switch happened yet?

Even with exciting advancements in battery- and hydrogen-powered aircraft, today’s planes — and a large portion of the future aircraft fleet — are dependent on burning liquid fuels. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), often in the form of biofuel (fuel derived from biological sources, like inedible waste cooking oil), can be used in today’s aircraft and has the potential to reduce the carbon intensity of flying by more than 80 percent. However, due to insufficient supply, cost barriers, and difficulty predicting demand, SAF currently represents less than 0.1 percent of the aviation fuel burned globally.

Shifting to these new methods is challenging and expensive. Making changes affects a large, well-established system. That’s where RMI comes in. The organization was made to tackle difficult, systems-level challenges, and aviation is a leading example where we are uniting corporate partners to support such a change.

How You Can Help

We need big ideas to shift to clean energy and bold partners who support our mission to make it happen. With your support, we will fuel a sustainable future for air travel.

Make A Gift Today

Sustainable aviation’s chicken-and-egg problem

Like other green products, SAF faces a chicken-and-egg paradox. Producing sustainable aviation fuel requires a significant up-front investment and relies on supply chains that are not yet efficient or well-coordinated, which forces suppliers to charge higher prices than fossil-derived jet fuel. Unsurprisingly, this makes it harder for SAF to compete with traditional fuels.

Many companies have committed to reducing their organization’s emissions from air travel, but few options exist. High costs and low availability mean that they can’t launch their own flights fueled with SAF. For suppliers, scattered demand from individual companies does not justify ramping up production.

That’s where RMI and strategic philanthropy are stepping in. With our experience in clean energy buyers alliances, RMI understands the power of aggregating demand.

The solution: an alliance of aviation customers

Nearly every company that moves people or products contributes to emissions from flying, and many of these companies also have sustainability goals that include reducing these emissions. Some had expressed to RMI and our partners that they needed a way to reduce emissions from their air travel. RMI and our partners at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) reached out to these businesses with a bold idea: join forces to spur a market for sustainable fuels and show suppliers that there is a real demand. EDF, the Center for Green Market Activation, and RMI, with support from ENGIE Impact, brought together nine founding companies to form the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA). Our goal: help bridge the gap between suppliers and customers and show the market that demand for SAF exists. Nine companies made initial philanthropic grants that allowed RMI to build the digital infrastructure required for scale, such as SAF sustainability procurement guidance and a credible registry to account for and track claims of emissions reductions. Philanthropic funding allowed RMI to bring independent diligence and credibility to the process and build a system that can sustain itself through memberships. SABA was able to use this infrastructure to support many of the original nine companies with the first aggregate purchase of SAF certificates.

The SAF certificate framework accounts for and tracks the emissions reduction from sustainable fuels. This allows an emissions-minded buyer anywhere in the world to purchase the certificate for emissions reduction, while the actual fuel can be delivered where it is most practical to use. While not yet codified into greenhouse gas accounting rules, RMI believes purchasing SAF certificates will allow a company to claim credible emissions reductions from reduction activities taken within the aviation value chain.

In this way, even though the companies purchasing SAF certificates don’t directly buy the fuel or send their cargo on flights that use specific volumes of SAF, their purchase reduces emissions in the aviation system and contributes to the market for further SAF development. This type of partnership is what allows low-carbon products like SAF to compete with traditional, emissions-intensive counterparts.

Today, SABA is supported by membership fees, has recently completed the largest aggregated SAF certificate transactions to date, and is working to develop more impactful procurement options for members. Philanthropy made this happen. By leveraging donor support, we removed early uncertainty from the system and allowed RMI to build the business case for a self-sustaining market.

Aviation charts the flight path to the future

Aviation’s success can illuminate pathways to reducing emissions for other heavy industries like shipping, trucking, and steel. Building on this work, RMI helped develop the registry used by the Zero-Emissions Maritime Buyers Alliance, and we are building new coalitions that include the Sustainable Steel Buyers Platform and ZEROGrid, a coalition focusing on clean energy to support grid reliability. A collaboration to advance sustainable cement and concrete will be forthcoming. In all these sectors, we will continue to organize corporate action as a critical headwind for cleaner products and energy.

These market signals are just the beginning for these ambitious buyers’ platforms, and more purchase agreements are planned in the coming months. Demand aggregating organizations like SABA will continue to bring together buyers as markets mature, scaling the demand signal needed to spur growth in the supply of lower-carbon products, and making lower-carbon products comparable in cost to traditional products. At RMI, we know that change can’t happen alone, but even the heaviest lift can be achieved when we band together.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/airplane-iStock-1526986072.jpg,N,,2025-04-30 19:57:03.785889

OMV is producing green hydrogen on a commercial scale for the first time. The Vienna-based fossil fuel and petrochemicals producer started up a 10 MW plant at its Schwechat refinery near Austria’s capital. It is the largest in the country.

The investment amounts to EUR 25 million. The electrolyzer system can produce up to 1,500 tons per annum. OMV said the green hydrogen would be used to make more sustainable fuels and chemicals including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel (HVO).

PEM electrolyzer uses wind power, hydropower, photovoltaics

The new 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM, also called proton exchange membrane) electrolyzer is powered entirely by renewable electricity. It is generated by wind power, hydropower plants and photovoltaics.

The innovation enables annual savings of up to 15,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the comparator from the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive. It is equivalent to 2,000 persons per year, based on the EU’s 2024 average of 7.5 tons of CO2 equivalent per capita.

“With the start-up of Austria’s largest electrolysis plant, we are re-inventing how essentials we use in everyday life are produced sustainably. Green hydrogen is at the heart of this transformation, serving as a critical component in producing fuels and chemicals while advancing the decarbonization of our Schwechat site,” said board member Martijn van Koten, responsible for fuels, feedstock and chemicals.

The Hungarian carrier, which flew over 60 million passengers in 2024, recently launched its own roadmap to reach net zero by 2050.

“Radical change needs to happen. Subsidies have to be redirected into renewable energy,” said Yvonne Moynihan, corporate & ESG officer at Wizz Air.

Moynihan told Skift that some airlines have included hydrogen in their roadmaps, but that Wizz Air excluded it and instead focuses on ""realistic levers.”

“We understand that the most realistic decarbonization levers are ones that we already have, which are improvements in current aircraft and engine technology and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“We need to kick start the production of SAF, this is the best chance for airlines to decarbonize.”

California SAF Investment

Moynihan pointed to California as an example of how government incentives can rapidly grow the SAF market.

She said despite recent political setbacks in U.S. federal climate policy, California has tried to incentivize the production of SAF with tax breaks.

“In spite of the current political environment, 90% of the world's SAF is being produced in California and that is because the government introduced tax incentives and tax breaks. This is the type of mechanism or instrument that's needed to really stimulate further supply. The demand is there, so really the issue is the supply,” Moynihan said.

Paying For Emissions

Wizz Air said it supports the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS), which is partly designed to raise funds to support decarbonization of sectors such as aviation.

But Moynihan said the system needs to be reformed because it unfairly penalizes short-haul airlines.

A recent report from Transport & Environment highlighted that low-cost carriers are paying more into the fund than long-haul airlines, as the ETS rules do not apply to international flights.

“Short-haul airlines are, in effect, subsidising the longer-haul carriers,” Moynihan said. “Those airlines have higher profit margins and emit more — yet they’re not subject to the same carbon costs.”

She added that Wizz has raised this issue multiple times with the European Commission, and called for the ETS to be extended to flights departing the EU to create a “level playing field.”

Fossil Fuel Subsidies in Europe

Wizz Air’s call to redirect subsidies comes amid growing pressure on European governments to phase out public support for fossil fuels.

In the EU, fossil fuel subsidies come primarily from national budgets but are also supported by EU-level funds, particularly for energy infrastructure.

The EU has previously said that most fossil fuel subsidies are due to be phased out by 2030.

According to Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, only 6 of the EU’s 27 member states have even stated an intention to fully eliminate fossil fuel subsidies - and none have set clear deadlines.

The EU did not respond to Skift's request for comment on fossil fuel subsidies.

EarthOptics GO1 – Turning Soil into Seed Intelligence

EarthOptics is transforming how the seed industry sees soil. By combining high-resolution mapping with biological and chemical insights, the company delivers powerful data that drives more informed decisions — before the seed ever hits the ground.

“Our mission from the beginning has been simple,” EarthOptics CEO Lars Dyrud says. “We want to measure everything of relevance in the soil — and give farmers and seed partners the intelligence they need to make the best decisions possible.”

With precise data on compaction, fertility, carbon, and soil biology, EarthOptics enables seed companies and agronomists to build smarter prescriptions and protect genetic potential with confidence.

“These are all questions farmers are making every year, but oftentimes they’re making their best guess,” chief product officer Cam Norgate says. “Now we can actually know.”

Following EarthOptics’ 2024 merger with Pattern Ag, the company now offers a full-stack platform—from physical and chemical measurements to DNA-based biological insights. This includes support for seed trials, trait validation, and product placement decisions at the field level.

“There’s a huge opportunity to understand how biological products can help boost yield potential,” Norgate says. “We help dealers identify what the opportunity is in the field—and make sure they get it onto the seed and into the ground.”

With demand for sustainable solutions and smarter ROI growing across agriculture, EarthOptics is helping the seed industry turn what’s beneath the soil into a strategic advantage.

“We’ve built a better way to plan a crop,” Dyrud says. “Now we’re focused on getting that power into more hands.”

Intelinair SeedTrax™ – Precision Built for Seed Corn Production

Seed corn isn’t just another crop — and SeedTrax isn’t just another digital platform. Developed through a powerful partnership between Hubner Industries and Intelinair, SeedTrax is the first digital tool purpose-built to handle the complexity, precision and scale of seed corn production.

While most ag tech is built for commercial grain, SeedTrax addresses the unique demands of seed production: tracking multiple hybrids in a single field, managing stand counts, detasseling, silking, rogueing, and scouting — all with traceability and actionable data.

“We were tired of always having to manipulate a tool that wasn’t built for what we do,” says Doug Hubner, CEO of Hubner Industries. “SeedTrax is changing that. It allows our field scouts and leadership team to see every acre in real time — with better intelligence and better results.”

The platform improves labor efficiency, enables smarter agronomic decisions, and generates more reliable supply estimates. Backed by aerial imagery, AI-driven insights, and real-time field data, SeedTrax helps experienced seed professionals manage more acres and mentor new scouts more effectively.

Pheno-Inspect AI in the Field to Transform Crop Monitoring

When Philipp Lottes founded Pheno-Inspect in early 2020, his vision was clear: bring advanced image-based AI technology out of the lab and directly into the hands of agricultural professionals. Drawing from his roots in agricultural robotics at the University of Bonn, Lottes saw a pressing need for scalable, practical tools that could serve real-world crop production and plant science.

Pheno-Inspect’s flagship platform, Plant-Analyzer, exemplifies this vision. It seamlessly integrates image data from a variety of sources — smartphones, drones, even satellites — to provide consistent, high-resolution insights across all stages of production. Whether it’s a small plot trial or a vast commercial field, the platform adapts to deliver meaningful, hardware-independent analysis.

At the heart of Pheno-Inspect’s approach is the fusion of artificial intelligence with deep agronomic expertise. “AI alone doesn’t create value — domain knowledge does,” Lottes emphasizes. His team builds AI models specifically designed for plant breeding and crop production, focusing on extracting economically relevant traits with high reliability and efficiency.

A major milestone came through their participation in the “RegisTer” project, which automated sugar beet variety evaluations. This initiative not only proved the feasibility of sub-millimeter trait detection under field conditions but also validated the use of affordable drone platforms. The success has since extended to a broader range of crops and continues to shape the company’s innovations.

Looking ahead, Lottes acknowledges that technology adoption hinges not only on performance but also on user trust and simplicity. “The true challenge is behavioral,” he notes. “That’s why we focus on intuitive, reliable tools that truly deliver.” As drone technology becomes more accessible, Pheno-Inspect aims to empower users across the globe to harness the full potential of AI-driven crop monitoring.

seedalive – Revolutionizing Seed Viability Testing Across Europe and Beyond

In the heart of Osnabrück, Germany, a groundbreaking innovation is transforming the way seed viability is measured. seedalive, founded by Klaus Mummenhoff and his former student, biologist Jens Varnskühler, is on a mission to make seed testing faster, simpler, and more reliable — empowering plant breeders, farmers, traders, and maltsters across Europe and beyond.

Traditionally, testing seeds for viability and quality has been a slow, resource-intensive process — often taking days or even weeks. seedalive changes that. With its patented, AI-powered test kits, seedalive delivers results in just hours. The dynamic bioassay not only predicts standard germination rates but also identifies abnormalities, dormancy, dead seeds, and germination speed — all while referencing data collected according to ISTA and AOSA standards.

And it’s not just about speed. The system is designed for modern agricultural realities: all it takes is a charged laptop and an internet connection. Whether on a remote farm or in a high-tech lab, seedalive’s cloud-based platform ensures fast, accurate, and reproducible results. For the malting industry, the platform offers equally transformative capabilities — assessing germination energy and water sensitivity of barley and wheat in as little as three hours.

seedalive’s technology is not just a tool — it’s a shift in paradigm. By significantly reducing the time and energy required for seed testing, it supports more sustainable agricultural practices and better decision-making across the value chain.

As the company grows, its vision remains clear: to become the new global gold standard in seed viability testing. With an energetic team and ongoing research collaborations, seedalive is not just keeping pace with the industry — it’s setting the pace.

ZeaKal PhotoSeed™ – Boosting Yield and Quality While Reducing Carbon Intensity

In an industry chasing more with less, ZeaKal’s PhotoSeed™ technology is giving crops a new kind of superpower: the ability to sustain photosynthesis longer, leading to bigger gains in oil, protein, and productivity — all without additional land or inputs.

“We confuse the plant into thinking it’s starving,” ZeaKal co-founder and CEO Han Chen says. “It’s the anti-Ozempic of plants.” That trick keeps plants working harder and longer to convert sunlight into energy, improving performance and sustainability.

ZeaKal’s trait technology, has roots in a surprising place — a napkin sketch in New Zealand. What began as an effort to improve pasture grass grew into something much bigger.

In soybeans, PhotoSeed reverses declining protein levels while increasing oil by up to 15%. In corn, it’s showing as much as 23% more oil. That’s a game-changer for renewable energy, particularly sustainable aviation fuel. Independent analysis suggests PhotoSeed could enable an extra billion gallons of U.S. SAF annually — without expanding farmland.

But ZeaKal’s ambitions go beyond yield. With its “NewType” model, the company hopes to rebuild supply chains around value instead of volume, helping farmers become price makers, not price takers.

“I want growers to say, ‘I know where my crop ends up. I know I’m feeding people better. I know I’m part of the energy transition,’” says Chen.

With PhotoSeed reaching growers in 2026, ZeaKal is betting on a future where innovation fuels not just crops — but a better food, fuel, and climate future. Watch for a more comprehensive feature about ZeaKal in Seed World U.S. June issue.

ZoomAgri Transforms Grain Quality Inspection with AI-Driven Innovation

ZoomAgri is revolutionizing the agricultural landscape with its innovative software that rapidly identifies soybean, wheat, and barley varieties in just two minutes. By utilizing cutting-edge Computer Vision and AI technology, this solution delivers precise results at a fraction of the cost.

In addition to variety identification, the software excels in assessing the percentage of damaged, broken, or peeled grains while also detecting foreign materials — each critical for ensuring quality in the supply chain.

ZoomAgri’s mission is to digitize the antiquated testing, inspection, and certification (TIC) processes that burden the agricultural and food industries through its unique “vision-as-a-service” (VaaS) model.

Since the launch of its flagship product, ZoomBarley, in 2018 — which evaluates malting barley purity in real-time — the technology has gained significant traction on a global scale. Building on this success, ZoomAgri introduced ZoomAgriSpex, a tool designed to evaluate the physical quality of grains and oilseeds in real-time. This feature addresses common issues within the industry, such as classification errors, delays, and inflated costs, making high-quality inspections much more efficient and reliable.

The implications of this groundbreaking technology extend beyond mere convenience — by streamlining quality assessments, ZoomAgri empowers stakeholders throughout the supply chain to optimize resource allocation and minimize waste. This translates into more efficient distribution processes, better use of transport and land, and ultimately, a more sustainable agricultural system.

In an industry where every grain counts, ZoomAgri is not just improving how we assess quality; it’s setting a new standard for efficiency and effectiveness in agricultural practice.

Operated by its affiliate, BSGF Company Limited, the facility is the country’s first to produce 100% Neat SAF, and it adheres to international sustainability certification standards, reported Bangkok Post.

Chaiwat Kovavisarach, Group CEO and President of Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited, described the unit as Thailand’s first fully integrated standalone SAF production facility. It manages the entire supply chain—from sourcing raw materials to fuel distribution—under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) framework. The plant has an initial production capacity of 1 million litres per day and uses Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology to convert materials such as used cooking oil into aviation-grade fuel.

The SAF production process was developed in partnership with two international technology providers: Belgium’s Desmet, known for feedstock pretreatment, and U.S.-based UOP Honeywell, a leader in hydroprocessing systems. This ensures consistent quality from raw material handling through hydrogenation and molecular refining to final product output. In addition to SAF, the plant also produces by-products like Bio-LPG and Bio-Naphtha and is currently undergoing performance testing.

According to data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), aviation contributes about 492 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually, despite making up just 2.9% of global energy use. SAF can cut these emissions by up to 80%, making it one of the most promising solutions for reducing the carbon footprint of air travel. Several regions, including the EU, UK, and Singapore, have already announced SAF blending targets, and Thailand is evaluating a similar mandate.

In addition to cutting carbon emissions, SAF also contributes to cleaner air. It has very low levels of sulphur and aromatic compounds—elements that contribute to health hazards and pollution—making it a more environmentally friendly alternative to conventional jet fuel.

Bangchak has been active in renewable energy for over two decades. The company’s efforts began in 2000 with a biodiesel project in partnership with the Royal Thai Naval Dockyard. It later launched Thailand’s first commercial biodiesel product in 2004 and a nationwide used cooking oil buy-back initiative in 2008.

Now, with the launch of the Neat SAF facility, Bangchak is building on that foundation. Its “Fry to Fly” campaign enables the public to contribute by selling used cooking oil at more than 290 Bangchak service stations nationwide—a number expected to grow to 2,000 by the end of 2025. The company is also developing a Book & Claim system, which will let passengers and airlines receive verified carbon credits for using SAF, encouraging broader adoption of sustainable aviation fuel.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-3.png,N,,2025-04-30 15:56:41.261287

Repsol said it expects its five Spanish refineries to return to normal operations within a week following the nationwide power outage on Monday, 28 April.

The company confirmed that power was restored to all its refineries on Monday evening, allowing the restart process to begin. It will take three days to restart the crude distillation units and 5-7 days to restart secondary conversion units, with hydrocrackers taking the longest, according to chief executive Josu Jon Imaz.

A momentary and unexplained drop in power supply on the Spanish electricity grid caused power cuts across most of Spain and Portugal, disrupting petrochemical plants and airports, as well as refineries.

Imaz noted that Repsol was fortunate that its refineries avoided damage from petroleum coke formation and other solidification processes during the shutdown. Repsol's 220,000 b/d Petronor refinery in Bilbao was the first to restart, thanks to electricity imports from France, he said.

Petroleum reserves corporation Cores has temporarily reduced Spain's obligation to hold 92 days of oil product consumption as strategic reserves by four days, mitigating potential supply issues from the outage.

Repsol's refining margin indicator, a benchmark based on European crack spreads weighted to the firm's product basket, has been recovering this week and stood at $7.5/bl this morning, compared with an average of $4.2/bl in April and $5.3/bl in the first quarter, according to Imaz.

The company posted a 70¢/bl premium to the indicator in January-March on refinery optimisation and use of heavier and cheaper crudes. This was lower than the $1.20/bl premium it reported in 2024 and negatively affected by the high water content in first-quarter deliveries of heavy Mexican Maya, a staple for Repsol's more complex refineries.

The high water cut in the Maya receipts shaved a potential 50¢/bl from Repsol's refining margin premium in the first quarter, and operational issues at the company's Tarragona refinery a further 20¢/bl, according to Imaz.

Repsol has already completed the three major refinery maintenance projects for 2025 it flagged at its Bilbao, Tarragona and Puertollano refineries. Work on the three refineries in the first quarter cut about 40¢/bl from the firm's refining margin.

The three factors point to a combined $1.10/bl shortfall in the firm's refining margin in the first quarter and were one of the reasons for the 80pc fall in adjusted profit at Repsol's refining-focused industrial division to €131mn ($149mn) in January-March from a year earlier and the 62pc fall in group profit to €366mn.",https://www.argusmedia.com/-/media/project/argusmedia/mainsite/images/14-generic-hero-banners/herobanner_1600x530_generic-c.jpg?h=530&iar=0&w=1600&rev=2cf023b4e0484c1bb091b9f72dbf7771&hash=72DBDFEBEF6EE62E751AB5DD2221C77E,N,,2025-04-30 14:56:34.353193

Travelers are also increasingly seeking sustainable practices and expect hotels to pay more than lip service to environmental factors.
The tourism sector now accounts for 9% of global emissions.
By 2030 the EU will require that fuel producers have 10% Sustainable Aviation Fuel in their fuel by 2030.
It’s clear that sustainable travel isn’t a passing trend, it is a growing societal norm.","“Tourism has long been seen as a way to escape, explore, and connect with the world,” Xavier Font, professor of sustainability marketing at the University of Surrey, told me in an interview. “But there’s a growing contradiction at its core: while travelers marvel at pristine coastlines, ancient glaciers, and untouched wilderness, the very act of traveling is helping to destroy those same wonders. The industry is responsible for nearly 9% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with accommodation alone accounting for more than 6%.”

Font stresses this isn’t a side issue but one that’s “central to the climate crisis.”

And yet, he adds, “the tourism sector continues to act like sustainability is a nice-to-have rather than a non-negotiable. It’s not enough to install energy-efficient lightbulbs or ask guests to reuse towels. These gestures, while helpful, are superficial without meaningful behavioral engagement from travelers themselves. Many guests unknowingly undermine green initiatives—leaving lights on, wasting water, or ignoring recycling bins—not because they don’t care, but because the messaging isn’t connecting.”

Behavioral science—and some significant nudging—can move the needle. Font and colleagues have conducted research in partnership with Booking.com and the hospitality company Accor to shed light on how accommodation providers can shift attitudes.

“[Our] study shows that smart, psychologically grounded messaging can influence guests to adopt more sustainable habits,” says Font. “Emotionally resonant communication that explains why sustainability matters, and how guests can play a role, is far more effective than vague instructions or guilt-laden commands.”

According to separate research from Booking.com, 28% of travelers feel traveling more sustainably is important, but an equal number report they are tired of routinely hearing about climate change.

“People are eager to be part of the solution. They need to be spoken to like adults, not lectured like children. Empowerment works. Transparency builds trust. Drawing parallels with what people already do at home can make sustainable choices feel second nature, not like a sacrifice,"" Font says.

“If the tourism industry wants to survive the coming decades—not just environmentally, but reputationally—it must stop treating sustainability as an afterthought,” concludes Font. “This is a moment to lead, not lag. Guests are ready. It’s time the [tourism]

industry caught up.”

Regulations Bolster Sustainable Travel Options

Most industries, organizations, and investors are committing to sustainability because it can generate significant cost savings and lead to a greater longer-term valuation of assets.

Travelers are also increasingly seeking sustainable practices and expect hotels to pay more than lip service to environmental factors. Tiny shampoo bottles are no longer seen as cute freebies by many travelers but as profligate waste when refillable larger containers make more environmental sense.

When planning trips, more and more travelers prioritize ESG factors. A recent Virtuoso survey found that nearly 60% of tourists are willing to pay more for hotels that have sustainability goals.

Between 20o9 and 2020 the carbon emissions from tourism increased by 3.5% compared to 1.5% for the rest of the global economy, a new study has found. Major contributors include aviation, utilities, and private motor vehicles. The tourism sector now accounts for 9% of global emissions.

The study, led by researchers at the University of Queensland and published by Nature Communications, attributed 60% of the increase in emissions to India, the U.S. and China. Key factors in the growth of emissions include population growth, rising income levels, and a surge in travel demand among emerging economies.

If the top 20 highest-emitting destinations had curbed their tourism growth by just 1% annually, an estimated 7% of global tourism-related emissions could have been avoided, said the study, led by University of Queensland professor Ya-Yen Sun.

The study highlights the urgent need for interventions in the tourism sector, cautioning that without action, emissions are projected to double every 20 years. In conclusion, the study’s authors called for immediate measures to decarbonize tourism and urges policymakers and industry leaders to align with climate targets.

Overall, the travel industry’s impact on the environment is coming under closer scrutiny from regulators. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, for example, will become mandatory for most international flights by 2027. By 2030 the EU will require that fuel producers have 10% Sustainable Aviation Fuel in their fuel by 2030.

FLOREAT, WESTERN AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA, April 30, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- 42kft.com (42 Thousand Feet), the leading global airline rankings platform, has unveiled its Top 25 Environmentally Focused Airlines, selected from the 142 airlines currently under its rigorous evaluation framework.

The list, presented in alphabetical order, includes:

Aegean Airlines, AeroMexico, Air Arabia, AirAsia Group, Air Baltic, Air New Zealand, Alaska Airlines, Alaskan Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airways, China Airlines, China Southern, EasyJet, Emirates, Etihad Airways, EVA Air, HK Express, IndiGo, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Ryanair, SAS Scandinavian, Singapore Airlines Group, VietJet, Virgin Atlantic/Virgin Australia, and Wizz.

Unlike other rankings based on pledges and aspirational targets, 42kft.com’s unique methodology prioritizes tangible progress, including fleet renewal, adoption of sustainable technologies, and verifiable environmental programs. Pledges such as “Net Zero by 2050” are considered baseline expectations—not distinguishing factors.

“With these rankings, we’re honouring real, measurable commitments to reducing carbon emissions,” said Geoffrey Thomas, founder of 42kft.com and a globally respected aviation journalist.

“We also acknowledge that government inaction in certain regions slows airlines' sustainability efforts. Our methodology is designed to highlight those pushing forward regardless.”

Thomas, who has written extensively on aviation’s environmental impact and co-authored three books on the topic, noted that fleet age is a critical ranking factor. However, global aircraft delivery delays—due to post-COVID supply chain issues and certification hold-ups—are affecting airlines’ ability to modernize.

“Take the Boeing 777-9, for example. Originally due in 2020, it's now pushed back to 2026 due to a combination of certification delays and supply shortages,” Thomas added.

About the Environmental Ranking System

42kft.com’s evaluation is based on nine key criteria:

Fleet age

Firm orders for fleet renewal

Commitment to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Recycling initiatives

Adoption of technological innovations

Verified carbon offset programs

Annual environmental impact reporting

IATA Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) compliance

Investment in electric and hybrid aircraft technologies

The platform currently covers airlines representing approximately 80% of global air passenger traffic, with new airlines being added monthly to ensure ongoing relevance and coverage.

The Austrian oil and gas company said it invested €25 million ($28.41 million) in the facility, which can produce up to 1,500 metric tons of green hydrogen per year. The green hydrogen will be used to produce fuels and chemicals, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel (HVO). The installation, which uses a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, runs entirely on renewable electricity from wind, hydro, and solar sources.

TU Graz has inaugurated a hydrogen electrolysis test center at its Inffeldgasse Campus to develop and test hydrogen technologies. The university said the 250-square-meter facility houses electrolyzers with a total capacity of 1.6 MW to 2.5 MW and includes a dedicated transformer station to ensure stable power supply, allowing researchers to simulate various electricity scenarios. At 80 bar of pressure, hydrogen flows through a pipeline to an 18-meter-high storage tank with a 190 kg (48m³) capacity. From there, it travels via a 315-meter underground pipeline to several institutes at Campus Inffeldgasse, where it is available around the clock for research. TU Graz said researchers will use the hydrogen on new and upgraded test rigs for next-generation large engines, turbines, hydrogen burners, and fuel cell stacks.

Wärtsilä said it has completed the development of the world’s first floating ammonia-to-hydrogen cracker in partnership with Höegh Evi. “This breakthrough technology enables floating import terminals to produce hydrogen at industrial-scale volumes from transported ammonia, marking a major step in the energy transition,” said the Finnish technology group. The industrial-scale ammonia cracker has a modular design that makes it compatible with hybrid floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs) and dedicated floating hydrogen terminals. It said the technology is highly scalable, with a send-out capacity of up to 210,000 tonnes of hydrogen annually. Ammonia storage can range from 10,000m³ to 120,000m³.

BMW has launched pilot operations of its first hydrogen trucks at Plant Leipzig under the European H2Haul project, working with Iveco, DHL, and TEAL mobility. The German automaker said the trucks will operate in Germany between Leipzig, Landsberg, and Nuremberg to assess drive performance in daily use, while new hydrogen refueling stations are being built in Leipzig and Hormersdorf.

With the UK’s SAF Mandate now in force - prescribing blending obligations from 2025 onwards - this article analyses the Mandate’s primary features, its interactions with other decarbonisation measures, and its relationship to emerging revenue support mechanisms. Our team examines the strategic role of SAF in the energy transition, assesses the challenges of scaling and enhancing investment in advanced fuels, and compares international regulatory divergences between the UK’s measures and SAF policies announced by other governments around the world. Through this, we situate the UK’s SAF Mandate not as an isolated intervention, but as a critical component of global energy transition and investment policies

Introduction: SAFs’ Strategic Role

Use of aviation fuel is estimated to be responsible for 2‑3% of the world’s annual greenhouse gas emissions1. Forecast increase in worldwide aviation travel, with some analysts predicting passenger numbers will double between 2024 and 20422, will further amplify the aviation sector's carbon footprint. The aviation sector is, however, difficult to decarbonise: current flight technology does not permit electrification of aircraft, nor are carbon-neutral fuels such as green hydrogen capable of use by current aircraft (or indeed realistically capable of use at scale given the immense challenges of those fuels).

The implications of these limitations are profound. SAF is not merely a transitional solution; it is, for the foreseeable future, the only technically viable decarbonisation pathway for long-haul aviation. Unlike hydrogen or electrification-both of which face formidable challenges in energy density, infrastructure readiness, and aircraft compatibility-SAF can be deployed immediately within existing aircraft and airport infrastructure. When combined with SAF’s lifecycle emissions reduction potential of up to 80% (as against fossil-based aviation turbine fuel), this compatibility underscores SAF’s criticality, not only as a climate measure, but as a strategic enabler of the aviation sector’s net zero trajectory. That SAF alone can decarbonise intercontinental routes with minimal operational disruption explains why it commands such prominence in policy design, investment prioritisation, and corporate transition strategies across jurisdictions.

Current SAF Production and Estimated Future Demand

Since the inaugural SAF-powered flight in 2008, and first use of SAF on a commercial aircraft in 2011, SAF demand has experienced consistent growth, with approximately 500,000 flights having operated on fuel mixtures containing SAF to date. Although SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of total aviation fuel consumption, usage doubled in 2023 to over 600 million litres. Industry projections now foresee a sustained acceleration in SAF production, with output in 2025 anticipated to surpass 2.7 billion litres - more than double the actual 2024 figure of 1.3 billion litres - and underscoring the sector’s rapid maturation.

Longer term, the International Air Transport Association (‘IATA’) estimates that SAF usage could account for approximately 65% of the aviation industry’s net zero targets by 2050. The UK government estimates that domestic production of up to 5Mt of SAF annually may be required to achieve the UK’s 2050 net zero target (representing 40% of pre-pandemic aviation fuel consumption of 12.4Mt during 2019). In addition, major airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and corporates are increasingly committing to ambitious SAF targets.

Barriers to Entry

Despite these demand signals, the high capital costs that SAF production projects necessitate currently constrain SAF production, and infrastructure remains limited. Furthermore, production costs remain high. Jet A-1 - the internationally accepted standard for aviation turbine fuel - is currently priced at approximately US$0.05 to US$0.06 per kWh. By contrast, average aviation biofuel prices are currently between US$0.18 and US$0.21 per kWh.

In order to increase SAF production levels, attain economies of scale and reduce prices, substantial further capital investment is required in production capacity and infrastructure for current aviation biofuels. The long-term evolution of synthetic fuels also depends on investors committing the necessary capital for research into technological innovation and extensive production infrastructure.

Facilitating such investment demands a stable, predictable policy framework and clearly articulated long-term targets and demand drivers. In contrast, perceived policy risks could deter sustainable, long-term investment. The coming into force of the UK’s SAF Mandate at the beginning of this year is the result of a multi-year effort by successive governments to provide this predictable policy framework and to increase demand drivers.

Development of the UK Landscape on SAF

Aviation in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme

The aviation sector’s coverage under emissions trading schemes began under the EU Emissions Trading System (‘EU ETS’), which, from 2012, extended its scope to flights from within the European Economic Area (‘EEA’), as well as flights between the EEA and select international routes. This marked the first substantive policy mechanism to apply a carbon price to aviation emissions, thereby initiating efforts to narrow the cost disparity between SAF and fossil-based jet fuel. By assigning an explicit cost to carbon, the EU ETS introduced a market signal intended to internalise the sector’s externalities, albeit one that, in its nascent form, applied only to a subset of routes and with generous free allocation of allowances.

Following the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (‘UK ETS’) came into force on 1 January 2021, supplanting the EU ETS for UK-covered routes. The UK ETS applies to emissions from domestic UK flights, UK-Gibraltar flights, and flights between the UK and EEA states, covering both commercial and cargo operations above a specified threshold. It retains core design features from the EU ETS - including auctioning of allowances, free allocation, and a cost containment mechanism - while introducing a UK-specific auction reserve price to maintain price stability. Crucially, both schemes treat eligible SAF as a ‘zero-rated’ fuel, meaning that aircraft operators reporting the use of qualifying SAF on a covered route are exempt from surrendering emissions allowances in relation to that fuel. This zero-rating feature provides an early - although partial - economic lever to reduce the effective cost of SAF relative to fossil-based aviation turbine fuel, particularly for operators with material ETS exposure. By aligning fiscal advantage with environmental performance, the ETS has become an important instrument in promoting SAF uptake, capable of complementing direct blending mandates.

Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation

The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (‘CORSIA’) was established under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization (‘ICAO’) in 2016 as a global market-based mechanism to address CO2 emissions from international aviation. It aims to stabilise net emissions from the sector at 2020 levels by requiring operators to offset emissions growth above a baseline set at 85% of 2019 emissions through the use of internationally recognised carbon credits. CORSIA entered its pilot phase in 2021, with full implementation scheduled in phases through to 2035. While participation is currently voluntary for most states, it is mandatory from 2027 for all ICAO Member States with significant aviation activity.

As an ICAO Member State, the UK commits to participate in CORSIA and is now considering how best to incorporate this international obligation into UK domestic law. In December 2024, the UK government published a consultation on the incorporation of CORSIA into UK law, with a view to ensuring compliance while maintaining coherence with the UK ETS. The consultation proposes two principal approaches: firstly, a ‘UK ETS-only’ option, which would apply the UK ETS exclusively to flights between the UK, the EEA, and Switzerland, thereby excluding those routes from CORSIA obligations; or secondly, a ‘price-based hybrid’ approach, under which both CORSIA and the UK ETS would apply concurrently to these routes, with operators eligible for financial compensation to mitigate the cumulative cost burden of dual compliance.

Notwithstanding the model adopted, incorporating CORSIA into UK law raises complex legal and policy questions: particularly regarding alignment with existing carbon pricing regimes, the fungibility of offset credits, and the potential for market distortion. Its integration of multilateral offsetting obligations into a sovereign emissions trading framework also marks a significant evolution in international climate governance.

UK Jet Zero Strategy

Acknowledging these policy drivers, the previous UK government unveiled its Jet Zero Strategy (‘the Strategy’) in July 2022, outlining a comprehensive plan to decarbonise the aviation sector. The Strategy foreshadowed a SAF Mandate – requiring that aviation turbine fuel supplied in the UK comprises at least 10% SAF by 2030 – combined with an objective to begin construction of at least five commercial-scale UK facilities by 2025. With these regulatory measures, some analysts surmise that SAF projects could deliver internal rates of return akin to those historically observed in the oil and gas sector, typically ranging from 6% to 17%.

UK Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation

Alongside this, the UK Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (‘RTFO’) entered into force in 2008, and explicitly recognised SAF an eligible fuel under the scheme from 2018, before the SAF Mandate amended the RTFO’s scope to exclude aviation turbine fuel. Under the RTFO framework, fuel suppliers had to ensure that a designated percentage of the fuel they supplied was derived from renewable or sustainable sources. The RTFO further established a development fuels sub-target to stimulate the use of renewable fuels of non-biological origin (such as electrolytic hydrogen and renewable e-fuels).

UK SAF Mandate: Obligations and Mechanisms

The SAF Mandate came into force on 1 January 2025 and applies to all UK aviation turbine fuel suppliers delivering at least 15.9 terajoules (approximately 468,000 litres) per calendar year (‘fuel suppliers’). Under the SAF Mandate, these fuel suppliers are required to blend certain minimum levels of SAF with conventional, fossil-based aviation turbine fuel.

The SAF Mandate comprises five primary components: a ‘main obligation’ to drive emissions reductions through SAF utilisation; a cap on SAF derived from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (‘HEFA’); a minimum power-to-liquid (‘PtL’) fuel obligation; robust sustainability criteria; and the introduction of a buy-out price. We analyse each of these mechanisms in detail below.

Main Obligation

The main obligation imposes escalating SAF supply obligations on fuel from 2025 to 2040. For 2025, fuel suppliers must ensure that SAF comprises 2% of the total aviation turbine fuel they supply in that year. Each supplier’s obligation is calculated in terms of total energy content — rather than fuel mass or volume — thereby accounting for differences in energy density. This annual target increases to 10% by 2030, 15% in 2035, and 22% in 2040 (refer to Figure 1 for each annual obligation from 2025 to 2040). In the Department of Transport’s (‘DfT’s’) estimation, these targets balance the need for long-term investment certainty in the UK’s SAF demand with the flexibility required to accommodate ongoing technological and commercial developments, whilst upholding ambitious environmental standards.

HEFA Cap

HEFA represents the key commercial-scale SAF production pathway currently available. Although HEFA qualifies as an eligible SAF under the main obligation, the government will cap the volume of HEFA eligible for incentives under the SAF Mandate. Initially, the HEFA cap begins at 100% for 2025 and 2026, then decreases to 92.31% in 2027, declining incrementally each year until the cap reaches 42.16% in 2040. This measure intends not only to encourage investment in a more diverse portfolio of advanced SAF technologies, but also mitigate the premature diversion of HEFA from its vital role in the road transport sector. Importantly, the cap restricts only the volume eligible for support under the SAF Mandate, not the total production of HEFA in the UK, acknowledging that the finite nature of its feedstocks faces global competition from other transport sectors.

Power-to-Liquid Obligation

Complementing the main obligation, the SAF Mandate introduces a dedicated requirement to supply PtL fuels, defined as low-carbon aviation turbine fuel synthesised from renewable (excluding biomass) or nuclear power. From 2028, the SAF Mandate will impose a PtL obligation of 0.2% of the total quantity of aviation turbine fuel that each supplier delivers in a given calendar year, escalating to 0.6% in 2030, and reaching 4.5% by 2040. It requires PtL suppliers to demonstrate that the renewable electricity consumed in the fuel’s production represents genuinely new or surplus generation, rather than diverting existing low-carbon supply from the grid. Suppliers must also demonstrate that their electricity qualifies as ‘additional eligible energy’, proving that it would not have been generated, or would otherwise been curtailed or wasted, without consumption by the PtL production site.

Sustainability criteria

To qualify for eligibility under the SAF Mandate, fuels must satisfy specified sustainability benchmarks, principally achieving a minimum greenhouse gas emissions reduction of at least 40% when compared to a fossil-based aviation turbine fuel baseline of 89gCO2e/MJ. This calculation employs a lifecycle methodology, consistent with the established approach under the RTFO (refer to Figure 2 for further detail). In setting these thresholds, the government sought to strike an appropriate balance between driving immediate substantive emissions reductions and enabling the inclusion of emerging fuel pathways, which may currently exhibit higher emissions, but hold substantial future decarbonisation potential. To maintain momentum towards deeper decarbonisation, the government anticipates progressively raising this GHG reduction threshold. While precise timings and increments for these increases remain under consideration, the government has stated it is committed to an evidence-based, phased approach that responds dynamically to market developments and technological advancements.

Furthermore, the SAF Mandate excludes SAF derived from food and feed crops, reflecting broader concerns over food security, land use pressures, and environmental sustainability. This exclusion aligns with the government’s objective to prioritise waste-based and advanced feedstocks, thereby fostering more resilient and socially responsible supply chains. Eligible SAF must conform to international technical standards — including, but not limited to, ASTM D7566 — which governs fuel composition, performance, and safety of synthetic fuels. Certified SAF may be blended with conventional, fossil-based Jet A-1 aviation turbine fuel in proportions of up to 50%, in accordance with ASTM D1655 specifications for aviation turbine fuel.

SAF Revenue Certainty Mechanism and Industry Levy

Scaling Challenges and Investment Imperatives

The SAF Mandate’s effectiveness will hinge on the sector’s ability to scale production rapidly and sustainably. Notwithstanding the strong demand signal that the SAF Mandate provides, material concerns persist across the industry regarding the feasibility of achieving the uplift in SAF volumes necessary to align with the UK government’s target trajectory. Reliance on HEFA-based fuels — though commercially proven — is inherently constrained by finite feedstock availability and competing demands from other sectors. As the SAF Mandate progressively tightens the cap on HEFA-derived fuels, the imperative to accelerate the commercialisation of advanced pathways — such as PtL and alcohol-to-jet technologies — becomes increasingly acute. Without sustained investment and technological maturation, meeting the higher-end blending obligations of the 2030s and 2040s risks becoming unattainable. Addressing this challenge will require not merely capital mobilisation but coordinated public-private efforts to de-risk innovation, expand production capacity, and secure resilient supply chains.

Revenue certainty mechanism

Against the backdrop of scaling imperatives and supply-side constraints, it is evident that regulatory demand alone will not suffice. Ensuring the bankability of SAF projects will require complementary measures to stabilise revenues and de-risk early investment. The high capital cost of SAF production facilities — with government estimates suggesting costs between £600 million and £2 billion to achieve economies of scale — combined with the substantial price differential between SAF and fossil-based aviation turbine fuel, underscores the need for further targeted support. The SAF Mandate alone does not address this issue: it creates an obligation to supply SAF but neither establishes a guaranteed market price, nor shields domestic producers from global production fluctuations or external price pressures.

In this context, securing affordable finance for SAF projects remains challenging. Perceived regulatory and revenue uncertainty, coupled with intense competition for capital from other low-carbon technologies, heightens the risk premium attached to SAF investments. Without additional mechanisms to stabilise project revenues and reduce investor exposure to price volatility, many SAF developments would struggle to achieve financial close at commercially viable terms.

Guaranteed strike price

Recognising these dynamics, the government has consulted extensively with industry over the past two years on the design of a bespoke revenue certainty mechanism, with a stated aim of enacting the necessary legislative framework by the end of 2026. Building on the proven model of contracts for difference (‘CfDs’) in the renewable electricity sector, the government has confirmed that the mechanism will operate on a ‘guaranteed strike price’ basis, ensuring that SAF producers are remunerated at a predetermined price per litre of fuel supplied. Implementation will proceed through private contracts between producers and a government counterparty, expected, although not yet formally confirmed, to be the Low Carbon Contracts Company (‘LCCC’).

This mechanism is based on an established precedent used for both renewable and (previously) nuclear projects and is now being deployed for hydrogen projects. Both the government and the majority of industry stakeholders felt that it was the model most likely to deliver credible, bankable revenue streams, and the highest level of investor confidence. It should be noted that the government has clarified that the first tranche of contracts signed under the revenue certainty mechanism will be limited to non-HEFA SAF production only.

There are a number of critical policy decisions to be taken in respect of the design of the SAF CfD. One of the most important relates to what to use as the ‘reference price’. A fundamental basis of a CfD is that it pays a difference payment bridging the gap between a pre-agreed strike price and a market reference price; it provides the revenue certainty of topping a producer up from a price which it should be able to achieve by selling its product in the (potentially volatile) market. For the renewables CfD, this is simple: there is a well-established, independently published market reference price for electricity. For SAF, this is not the case: the market is far more nascent than the power sector.

The government faced similar challenges in relation to the Low Carbon Hydrogen Agreement (‘LCHA’) and decided that the reference price should be set at the price that producers are actually able to sell hydrogen for (the achieved sales price). This is one of the preferred options for the SAF CfD. If that is the case, there are two follow-on design features which are critical to address the resultant incentive issue (that is to say, a producer has no incentive to sell SAF at anything above a nominal price if they are always topped up to the strike price).

Firstly, the revenue certainty mechanism would need to set a floor price which SAF producers know they could attain. Whilst the fossil-based aviation turbine fuel price would appear to be the most obvious floor price — following the logic of using the gas reference price as a floor price for hydrogen — the government will need carefully to consider whether this level is appropriate, especially in the context of likely competition from imported SAF and the difficulty of finding offtakers willing to pay a variable price on a long-term contract.

Secondly, the government needs to ensure that SAF producers are incentivised to sell SAF for prices above the floor price. Under the hydrogen business model, producers are permitted to keep 10% of any price achieved above the floor price as a ’price discovery incentive’. We would expect a similar mechanism to be included. In practice, it remains to be observed whether these incentive structures will be sufficient to secure robust offtake pricing. For example, some producers may be willing to accept the floor price in exchange for concessions on other offtake terms (such as in relation to liability regimes) and forego the 10% incentive payment: clearly, the risk of that occurring lessens if the incentive percentage is set at a higher level.

Another critically important policy decision will be how the strike price is adjusted. There are numerous options here (for instance, indexing a portion of the strike price to relevant feedstock prices — which will differ for various pathways — or energy costs, or simply indexing everything to CPI: as for green hydrogen and renewables projects). There is a balance to be struck: whilst DfT may be reticent for LCCC to be exposed to an increase in feedstock prices (in the same way that DESNZ has been unwilling for LCCC to be exposed to increases in power prices for green hydrogen projects: see more here), the alternative could ultimately be more expensive if producers look to reflect this in very expensive, long-term, fixed-price feedstock contracts or a higher cost of capital (both of which will translate to a higher initial strike price).

Fundamentally, clarity over the revenue support structure will serve as a precondition for unlocking institutional capital, particularly from infrastructure funds and impact investors whose mandates hinge on predictable cash flows and regulatory stability. In this respect, we might view the revenue certainty mechanism not merely as a subsidy, but as a structural market reform intended to internalise environmental externalities and provide long-term price certainty for an emerging commodity.

Funding the revenue certainty mechanism

In March 2025, the government published a consultation in relation to how the revenue certainty mechanism will be funded, having previously promised the scheme would be ‘industry funded’. In line with the ‘polluter pays principle’ set out in the Environment Act 2021, it is currently contemplated that the revenue certainty mechanism will be funded by a variable levy on the same aviation turbine fuel suppliers — of which the government estimates there are around 20 in total — that are obligated under the SAF Mandate. The relevant fuel suppliers will pay differing amounts depending on their respective market shares and the payments required are likely to vary over time depending on the price of non-HEFA SAF.

The government’s rationale for funding the levy from high up the supply chain is that the cost will be shared between airlines, freight companies and passengers. The government has sought to reassure fuel suppliers that the requirements for funding will only be modest (the consultation projects that a worst-case scenario would require £10 billion in subsidies to producers over 15 years) and that fuel suppliers will benefit from the likely increase in supply — and resultant reduction in cost — of SAF as a result of the subsidy scheme.

International Comparison of SAF Policies

Governments worldwide are also actively establishing measures to accelerate SAF deployment. In the EU, the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation mandates steadily increasing SAF blending requirements, starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to 70% by 2050. Unlike the UK’s approach, which permits suppliers to discharge shortfalls through a predefined buy-out payment, ReFuelEU imposes direct obligations on fuel suppliers — together with certain operational requirements on airports and airlines — and enforces compliance through monetary penalties.

While both regimes impose financial consequences for failures to meet blending targets, their legal character diverges. The UK’s buy-out mechanism operates as an ex ante compliance alternative, deliberately priced to incentivise physical SAF uptake, while providing a predictable ceiling on non-compliance costs. By contrast, ReFuelEU Aviation treats blending as a strict legal obligation: non-compliance triggers an ex post enforcement penalty, with no structured alternative to achieving the mandated volumes. This structural distinction reflects a broader difference in regulatory philosophy between the two regimes, balancing flexibility and deterrence in contrasting ways.

In addition, the EU and UK regimes’ SAF eligibility criteria diverge in several material respects. ReFuelEU Aviation imposes higher lifecycle emissions reductions of 65% for biofuels and 70% for PtLs, compared to the UK’s 40% minimum standard. Feedstock eligibility also differs: the EU restricts eligible feedstocks to a narrower range of inputs than the UK. Certification requirements further diverge, with the UK relying on domestic verifiers and the EU mandating recognition under approved voluntary schemes. The EU also enforces a 90% minimum uplift requirement to mitigate tankering risks, a measure absent from the UK’s framework.

Furthermore, ReFuelEU Aviation does not establish a certificate trading scheme. Compliance under ReFuelEU is demonstrated directly through verified records of physical SAF supply and sustainability certification, without the creation of tradable surplus credits. Finally, both the EU and UK regimes require certain synthetic SAF production facilities to comply with temporal correlation requirements. This means those facilities must match the facility’s renewable electricity consumption with renewable energy supplied exclusively to the specific facilities, although EU requirements remain less restrictive than those applicable in the UK. These differences have practical implications for cross-border SAF supply chains and project structuring.

In North America, the US Inflation Reduction Act has established significant incentives to catalyse SAF production. Until the end of 2024, a dedicated tax credit under section 40B offered a base rate of US$1.25 per gallon, increasing to a maximum of US$1.75 per gallon for SAF achieving lifecycle emissions reductions exceeding 50% relative to fossil-based aviation turbine fuel. From 1 January 2025, this regime transitioned to the Clean Fuel Production Credit under section 45Z, which offers a base credit value of US$0.35 per gallon of SAF produced. This amount escalates to a maximum of US$1.75 per gallon when prevailing apprenticeship and wage requirements are satisfied, and the fuel achieves the lowest carbon intensities. The credit value is further adjusted based on the fuel’s CO2 emissions factor and annual inflation rates. Separately, California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (‘LCFS’) and British Colombia’s LCFS incentivise SAF production by enabling the issuance and trading of compliance credits to achieve carbon intensity benchmarks.

At the global level, CORSIA remains in its voluntary phase until the end of 2026, and covers around 60% of total international aviation emissions. CORSIA’s sustainability criteria — as specified by ICAO — differ slightly, but materially, from those under ReFuelEU Aviation and the UK SAF Mandate. For instance, CORSIA accepts a wider range of eligible feedstocks, including certain crop-based materials. Its lifecycle emissions threshold is also less demanding, requiring a minimum 10% reduction relative to fossil-based aviation turbine fuel.

Yet, while international schemes diverge in their sustainability criteria and enforcement mechanisms, a common structural challenge persists: how to match regulatory ambition with SAF distribution and availability. With this, governments may need to consider the deployment of ‘book-and-claim’ mechanisms to complement physical SAF deliveries. By decoupling the environmental attributes of SAF from its physical movement, book-and-claim models could offer flexible, cost-effective pathways for operators to meet compliance obligations, even where direct SAF supply is unavailable. If properly calibrated, such mechanisms can preserve environmental integrity — ensuring rigorous verification of emissions reductions — while expanding access to SAF markets globally. Furthermore, aligning book-and-claim standards with international frameworks could enhance certificate fungibility across jurisdictions and mitigate the risk of regulatory arbitrage.

Conclusion and Implications

The UK SAF Mandate’s introduction signals a decisive step forward in the UK’s ambition to decarbonise aviation, offering clarity and predictability for stakeholders across the aviation turbine fuel supply chain. While challenges undoubtedly remain — particularly relating to price certainty, supply chain maturity, and international competitiveness — the SAF Mandate represents a sophisticated regulatory approach, balancing ambition with pragmatism. As governments worldwide implement comparable policies, industry players must contend with an increasingly intricate regulatory landscape. Yet, those positioning themselves strategically could leverage significant opportunities in the emerging SAF market. Ultimately, the SAF Mandate’s effectiveness will depend on robust policy coherence, continued innovation, and targeted financial support mechanisms to ensure the UK’s aviation sector is not merely compliant, but indeed a global leader in the net zero aviation journey. In this respect, it will be critical for the UK government to strike the right balance with the revenue support mechanism being crafted for SAF production projects, and industry players will want to ensure they are poised to continue to input and shape the development of these mechanisms.",https://www.slaughterandmay.com/media/mnmdelgq/default-share.jpg,N,,2025-04-30 11:57:10.424145

Key findings from the 2025 report

This year’s results show an industry focusing more closely on near-term efficiencies, strengthening internal systems, and adjusting communication practices in response to growing scrutiny.

Shift in investment priorities: Fleet renewal has emerged as the overwhelming focus in 2025, overtaking sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) which dominated investment in 2024.

SAF reality check: SAF adoption remains low with most airlines using less than 1%, despite 73% having formal uptake plans targeting 10% by 2030.

Communication strategies are becoming more cautious: Only 5% of airlines openly promote their sustainability progress, with concern about greenwashing rising from 35% to 59%.

Sustainability teams and budgets continue evolving: Hybrid models remain dominant, half of airlines now have Chief Sustainability Officers, and 63.6% increased their budgets over the past year — although nearly half are no longer disclosing allocation details.

Persistent and new barriers are shaping decisions: High costs and technological limits remain the most significant obstacles. New challenges include internal resource constraints and lack of industry-wide collaboration.

As airlines navigate this pivotal transition, strategic collaboration, supportive policy, and sustained investment will be critical to maintaining momentum towards net zero.

Over three years, two helicopters – Christoph Rheinland (Airbus H145) and Christoph Europa 1 (Airbus H135) – have logged over 1,800 flight hours using a SAF blend containing up to 38% bio-derived components. The SAF, produced from recycled vegetable oils, is a drop-in fuel compatible with existing infrastructure.​

Tobias Grein, researcher from the German Aerospace Center’s (DLR) Institute of Combustion Technology, who supervised the project on the DLR side, said: “We used our mobile DLR measurement laboratory for the first measurement campaign of its kind and the only one of its kind to date. It contains special measuring and analysis equipment. These are suitable for investigating ultrafine particles down to a size of seven nanometers. Before each measurement campaign, we develop an individual concept and determine the setup, position of the measuring probe and the duration of the measurements. This is the only way to obtain reliable and comparable data.”

His conclusion: “These measurements were very exciting and also something special for our team to do all this live on a helicopter shortly before takeoff.”​

Key findings include a 44% reduction in ultrafine particle emissions when idle and a 33% reduction during cruise speeds. No adverse effects on engine performance or emissions of CO₂, CO, or NOx were observed. Engine manufacturers Safran Helicopter Engines and Pratt & Whitney Canada reported no significant wear differences compared with conventional kerosene use.​

Frédéric Bruder, CEO of ADAC Luftrettung, emphasized the organization’s commitment to decarbonizing air rescue operations and announced plans to increase the SAF blend to 100% and explore synthetic e-fuels (power-to-liquid) in the future.​

Jean-François Sauer, EVP Programs at Safran Helicopter Engines, commented: “This long-term trial of SAF use on an H145 helicopter powered by our Arriel engine is a major milestone. It demonstrates the compatibility of our engines with SAF on long-term operations and to characterize the environmental benefit, both for CO2 and local pollutant emissions reduction.”​

This bespoke procedure required teams to create, chart, test and certify an entirely new approach specific to Delta's operations.
Initiatives like the Hilo airport landing procedure collectively contribute to these impressive financial and environmental outcomes.","Like all airlines, Delta is exploring ways in which it can decarbonise.

As things stand, aviation accounts for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is responsible for releasing around 800 million tonnes of CO₂ into the atmosphere each year.

And despite the best efforts of airlines around the world, that percentage is only expected to rise as other industries decarbonise, simply by virtue of the fact that aviation is especially difficult to make sustainable compared to other sectors.

Delta is not content to approach sustainability with apathy, though. The carrier is making some big changes to its operations in a push to reduce fuel consumption.

“Why? Because sustainability is good for business and our people,” says Amelia DeLuca, CSO at Delta.

How is Delta approaching sustainability?

Delta’s sustainability department is making the case for sustainability as a business imperative.

It’s far from easy, though. Each airport and destination in Delta's network is a unique proposition.

A prime example emerged recently at Hilo Airport in Hawai’i, where Delta's Flight Operations and Operations Control Center (OCC) teams collaborated with the airline's Carbon Council to pioneer a fuel-saving landing approach.

“Throughout Delta’s journey to net zero emissions by 2050, we remain committed to decarbonising operations long term, while making changes within our control now to save on jet fuel,” says Amelia.

Hawaiian innovation demonstrates approach

The easternmost runway in Hawai’i presented both challenges and opportunities for Delta's sustainability teams.

Identifying potential fuel savings for Pacific flights using Hilo as a diversion point, Delta specialists developed a proprietary landing approach requiring less jet fuel.

This bespoke procedure required teams to create, chart, test and certify an entirely new approach specific to Delta's operations.

“The team noticed there was a better way of doing things that burned less fuel, so they innovated across teams to make a change,” Amelia explains.

While representing just one airport among hundreds in Delta's global network, the Hilo initiative exemplifies the airline's commitment to implementing fuel-saving measures wherever possible.

It also demonstrates how seemingly minor operational adjustments can generate substantial cost savings when implemented at scale.

Financial benefits complement environmental gains

With more than 4,000 daily flights, Delta recognises that even minimal fuel savings per flight can deliver significant cumulative benefits.

Jet fuel represents one of Delta's largest operational expenses, making efficiency improvements financially attractive beyond their environmental impact.

Earlier this year, the airline announced reaching its first fuel savings milestone, achieving one percent fuel burn reduction through operational improvements.

This translated to 45 million gallons of jet fuel saved, delivering cost benefits exceeding US$110m for the global carrier.

The US-based firm is well aware that aviation is a hard-to-abate industry, with opportunities to decarbonise few and far between, but it is always looking for areas in which it can reduce its environmental impact.

Sustainable aviation fuel is still a nascent market, so United has begun to explore methods of making planes more fuel efficient while running on their current fuel mix.

United has announced that it is investing in aerospace start-up JetZero, a cutting-edge company that is reimagining the way planes are made.

The partnership between the two includes a conditional purchase agreement for up to 200 aircraft, pending development milestones.

JetZero’s revolutionary design promises huge efficiency gains

JetZero's innovative ‘blended wing body’ design represents a radical departure from conventional tubular aircraft shapes.

Its unusual ‘all wing’ design helps to distribute lift across the entire aircraft structure.

It is thought that this aerodynamic approach could reduce fuel consumption by up to 50% per passenger mile compared to similar-sized conventional aircraft.

""If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network,"" says Andrew Chang, Head of United Airlines Ventures.

The Z4 is designed to accommodate 250 passengers with a range of 5,000 nautical miles, making it suitable for long-haul routes.

JetZero's aircraft will utilise conventional jet engines with the ability to run on sustainable aviation fuel blends.

Military backing accelerates development timeline

JetZero’s aerodynamic design bears some resemblance to the B-2 Bombers sometimes used by the US military, so perhaps it is little surprise that the US Air Force has helped to fund the company.

An investment of US$235m was announced in 2023, which will help to fast-track the creation of a full-scale demonstrator aircraft, with a first flight expected in 2027.

The Air Force's interest stems from potential applications for transport and refuelling tanker variants.

These military configurations could address approximately 60% of the Air Force's total annual jet fuel consumption.

Passenger experience and operational benefits

Beyond sustainability improvements, the Z4 promises enhanced passenger comfort through its unique cabin layout.

The design allows for flexible seating configurations, larger seats across all classes and dedicated overhead bin space for each passenger.

A wider main boarding door leading to multiple aisles aims to streamline the boarding process.

The aircraft is designed to integrate with existing airport infrastructure without requiring modifications to jet bridges, runways or taxiways.

This innovation holds the promise of addressing water scarcity issues, particularly in remote areas lacking access to clean drinking water. With water scarcity being a growing concern worldwide, this technology could be a game-changer, offering a sustainable and cost-effective solution. As we delve into the specifics of this remarkable advancement, we’ll explore the science behind hydrogels, their practical applications, and their potential to transform water accessibility globally.

The Science Behind Hydrogels

Hydrogels are unique materials that exhibit the ability to absorb and retain significant amounts of water. This property makes them particularly effective in capturing moisture from the air. According to the United Nations, while global access to safely managed drinking water improved from 69% to 73% between 2015 and 2022, millions still lack access, especially in isolated regions. This is where hydrogels come into play. Recent innovations, like the AquaGel developed by Chinese students for the Dyson Awards, utilize a thin layer of 3D-printed hydrogel to collect atmospheric humidity. Such technologies are now being refined further to enhance water capture efficiency.

In February 2025, a team from the University of Texas at Austin presented a novel method in the journal Advanced Materials. They have developed molecularly functionalized biomass hydrogels to transform organic matter into sorbents, materials capable of capturing liquids. This approach is a significant leap forward, offering a sustainable method to harness water from the air in even the most arid conditions. By utilizing biomass-derived hydrogels as a tool for water collection, researchers are paving the way for innovative solutions to global water challenges.

An Abundant and Inexpensive Resource

The use of biomass for hydrogel production involves readily available materials such as food waste, dead branches, and shells. These hydrogels can harvest potable water from the atmosphere, even during droughts, using mild heat. Researchers have demonstrated the device’s capability to collect up to 3.75 gallons of potable water daily. The biodegradable nature of these hydrogels means they require minimal energy to release the accumulated water, making them an eco-friendly option.

The innovation pivots away from traditional methods of “selection and combination,” which necessitate choosing specific materials. Instead, with molecular engineering, any biomass can become an effective water collector. Other materials, like cellulose, starch, and chitosan, have also shown promise during testing. This adaptability makes the technology suitable for off-grid communities and emergency relief operations in isolated areas. By making use of an abundant and inexpensive resource, this innovation offers a sustainable and practical solution to water scarcity.

Potential Impact on Global Water Scarcity

The implications of using hydrogels for water collection are profound, particularly for regions facing acute water shortages. As climate change exacerbates water scarcity, technologies like these could provide a lifeline for communities without reliable access to clean water. This method not only provides immediate relief but also offers a long-term solution by utilizing sustainable materials and processes. The ability to produce water from air, regardless of climatic conditions, means that even in dry areas, communities can access the essential resource they need to survive and thrive.

Moreover, the implementation of this technology could reduce dependency on traditional water sources, which are often strained or polluted. By integrating these hydrogels into existing infrastructure, communities can enhance their resilience against future water-related challenges. This innovative approach not only addresses the symptoms of water scarcity but also tackles its root causes by promoting the use of renewable resources.

Kenya’s KOKO Networks has secured a $179.6-million guarantee from the World Bank’s insurance arm Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) to protect its carbon credit revenues from political risks, the company shared in a press release on Monday March 17. This move could strengthen investor confidence in compliance-grade carbon markets like CORSIA.

However, KOKO’s credits are not yet CORSIA Phase 1 eligible, as they still require a letter of authorisation (LoA) and corresponding adjustments from the Kenyan government. MIGA issued the guarantee to cover investments by KOKO Networks of Mauritius into its Kenyan subsidiary. The coverage shields the company from risks including expropriation, transfer restrictions and breach of contract for up to 15 years, ensuring it can continue generating and trading carbon credits under evolving regulatory frameworks.

A Singapore-based trader told Fastmarkets that while bids for the Gold Standard (GS)-certified KOKO’s cookstoves credits were heard around $12-$16 per tCO2e, offers were reported around $20 per tCO2e. The gap highlights the challenges facing Article 6-aligned projects, as buyers weigh regulatory uncertainty and the timeline for securing corresponding adjustments against the potential long-term value of compliance-grade credits.

A London-based trader added that while prices for CORSIA Phase 1 credits are currently reported around $21 per tCO2e levels, they will likely drop once supply increases in the market after host country governments grant corresponding adjustments.

However, there remains uncertainty over the supply outlook for this year. Both Gold Standard and Verra require insurance to protect against revocation risk by a host-country between an LoA being granted and a corresponding adjustment being made and reported. Currently Gold Standard only accepts MIGA insurance, but both Gold Standard and Verra are looking at setting guidelines and criteria to evaluate other insurance providers later in the year.

KOKO supplies bioethanol cookstoves and fuel to over 1.3 million low-income households in Kenya, replacing charcoal and firewood – major drivers of deforestation and indoor air pollution. The transition generates about 6 million tonnes of carbon credits annually, certified under GS, with revenues used to subsidize fuel costs. The company has issued over 10 million vintage 2021-2024 credits as of late-March.

Greg Murray, Koko’s chief executive officer, said the company operates in highly regulated energy and carbon markets where political risk is a key concern. “MIGA’s guarantee ensures that our carbon finance model remains viable, allowing us to continue expanding clean fuel access while generating compliance-grade carbon credits,” he said. The World Bank has increasingly turned to guarantees to de-risk climate investments, and MIGA’s backing of KOKO suggests a growing focus on carbon finance as a tool for energy transition.

As demand for high-integrity carbon credits rises, particularly in compliance markets, financial risk coverage could play a larger role in stabilizing long-term investments in carbon projects. However, the effectiveness of such guarantees will depend on the speed at which governments implement the necessary policy frameworks to align with international carbon market rules.

Arup agrees £1mln investment for 10,000 tCO2e of UK nature-based carbon removals

UK-based consultancy Arup agreed to a £1 million ($1.27 million) investment to support the restoration of UK nature-based project developer Nattergal’s 617 hectare Boothby Wildlands project in Lincolnshire. As part of the investment, Arup will receive 10,000 tCO2e of nature-based carbon removals from the project over the next 30 years.

The upfront investment, rather than through land ownership or payment on delivery, provides a “new model for private sector support in nature restoration” Arup said in a statement in early March. The company said that nature-based carbon removal projects are “not happening at the speed needed” so hopes the upfront investment will accelerate the development and delivery of the project.

The project involves the rewilding of arable farmland, with Arup’s investment supporting the restoration of 67.5 hectares of degraded land with carbon-depleted soils. This increases carbon sequestration and creates other environmental benefits including enhanced biodiversity, improved soil health and water quality, and flood attenuation. The carbon removal credits generated from the project are verified under Wilder Carbon’s Standard for Nature and Climate.

The deal marks the largest purchase of credits registered under the Wilder Carbon Registry. Previously just over 400 tCO2e credits had been purchased by three entities across two projects. A total of just four projects are currently registered under the standard. The registry lists the total cost of the Boothby Wildlands project at £5.2 million.

Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) demand ends the quarter strong, led by Microsoft

Demand for multi-year nature-based and durable CDR offtakes ended the quarter strong, with just under 2.5 million tCO2e agreed and tracked by Fastmarkets in March.

Microsoft continued to be the main demand driver in the market, signing a 1.5 million tCO2e Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR) offtake with Climate Impact Partners and Terra Natural Capital. The credits will be generated from the Panna ARR (VCS 4811) project in India and be delivered over 30 years, with the offtake representing around 50% of the project’s output.

Microsoft had previously signed multi-year ARR offtakes totalling more than 10 million tCO2e in January.

Carbon demand aggregator Frontier also signed a $33 million agreement for over 78,000 tCO2e of enhanced rock weathering (ERW) credits with US developer Eion in March to be delivered between 2027 and 2030. There have been signs of increased interest from buyers for ERW credits this year with some viewing it as a scalable pathway to durable carbon removals.

Other notable deals agreed this month included Japanese shipping company Mitsui OSK Lines purchasing 30,000 tCO2e of direct ocean capture credits from Captura for delivery by 2030. While Meta bought 676,000 tCO2e of Improved Forest Management (IFM) removal credits for delivery through 2035 from investment firm EFM. The structure of the deal was novel, in that the negotiations to purchase the land took place in parallel to the offtake agreement. Traditionally property owners have sold credits only after securing ownership.

Airbus to test Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) ‘book and claim’ demand through 2025

Airbus will test customer demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through 2025 with a pilot program for “book and claim,” the company announced late March. Book and claim allows customers to request and pay for SAF usage to offset the carbon emissions from their own activities, and claim the emissions credits.

The actual SAF is used wherever it is available and most convenient within the overall aviation system, not necessarily on the routes used by the booking customer. Airbus will purchase SAF certificates through the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) registry. The pilot program will focus on customers who need “limited volumes” and are far from SAF supply points, the press release said.

To that end, Airbus has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to collaborate on the book and claim pilot program with a number of private jet charter companies, maintenance providers and other small companies. Airbus has collaborated with and invested globally in a number of airlines, producers and financing initiatives toward the development of the SAF industry.

Earlier this month, Airbus announced that SAF deliveries had begun at its Mirabel, Canada commercial aircraft assembly site, marking SAF availability at all of the company’s test and assembly sites worldwide. At the same time, Airbus announced that 18% of its global fuel mix in 2024 was made up of SAF, and that it would continue to increase its usage toward a goal of 30% by 2030.

Frontier agrees $33 mln enhanced rock weathering carbon removal offtake with Eion Frontier, a carbon demand aggregator, has agreed a $33 million multi-year offtake agreement with US carbon removals project developer Eion for 78,707 tCO2e of enhanced rock weathering carbon credits between 2027 and 2030, according to a press release in late March.

The credits will be sourced from Eion projects in the Southern and Midwestern US, and equates to a cost of around $419.27 per tCO2e. Eion sources olivine, a rock type that reacts quickly with carbon dioxide, and spreads it on agricultural fields. The olivine then reacts with rainwater, converting atmospheric carbon dioxide into bicarbonate, which is then stored permanently in the ocean.

The fast weathering of olivine allows it to remove more carbon dioxide than other enhanced weathering methods. Meanwhile, the ability to subsidize costs with carbon credits allows farmers to use a cheaper alternative to ag lime for managing soil pH. The deal will allow Eion to expand its monitoring and validation efforts, and help drive down the cost of durable carbon removal through enhanced rock weathering, Anastasia Pavlovic, Eion’s chief executive officer, said.

Other market participants have told Fastmarkets that, despite comprising small volumes currently, interest in enhanced rock weathering has increased in recent months, with some viewing it as a scalable pathway to durable carbon removals.

Frontier buyers, including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Autodesk, H&M Group, JPMorgan Chase, Workday and Salesforce, formed part of the agreement. Other companies will also receive credits via Frontier’s partnership with US-based sustainability platform Watershed.

The Carbon Markets are at the forefront of climate innovation, bridging the gap between corporate sustainability goals and global climate targets.

Brazil's 2025-26 sugar crop to near record 46mn t

Sao Paulo, 29 April (Argus) — Brazil may produce a record amount of sugar in the 2025-26 sugarcane crop despite lower crushing because more feedstock is set for the sweetener's production instead of ethanol. Brazil is set to produce 45.9mn metric tonnes (t) of sugar in the 2025-26 crop — which officially started on 1 April — a 4pc increase from the prior season, according to national supply company Conab's first estimate for the cycle. But Conab expects 2025-26 sugarcane crushing to decrease by 2pc from the the prior season, because of unfavorable weather conditions in the months prior to the beginning of the crop. The center-south — responsible for 90pc of national output — was hit by lack of rainfalls and high temperatures in most of last year, harming the development and growing of crops which would be harvested in the current cycle. The planted sugarcane area is expected to reach 8.8mn hectares (ha), a slight 0.3pc rise from the prior cycle, but yields are estimated to decrease by 2.3pc to 75,450 kg/ha. The annual increase in sugar output came because international sugar prices became more attractive than domestic ethanol prices. Both products are derived from sugarcane and production of one occurs at the expense of the other. Additionally, Brazilian mills increased investments on sugar crystallizing capacity last year and market participants expect the results to materialize this season. Ethanol output to fall Brazil will produce 36.8bn l (635,180 b/d) of ethanol in the 2025-26 crop, a 1pc drop from the 2024-25 season, driven by less sugarcane-based ethanol, Conab said. Sugarcane ethanol output is estimated to drop by 4.2pc from the prior cycle, because of less available feedstock and an estimated higher share of sugarcane directed to sugar production instead of the biofuel. But a projected 11pc increase in corn-based ethanol production in the 2025-26 season from the previous cycle partially offsets that expected drop in sugarcane ethanol output. Hydrous ethanol production in the 2025-26 season is estimated to total 22.7bn l, a 6.8pc decrease from 24.4bn l in the 2024-25 crop, while output of anhydrous ethanol — used as a gasoline blendstock — may rise by 10pc to 14.1bn l.

European aviation emissions to surpass pre-Covid levels

London, 29 April (Argus) — Carbon emissions from the European aviation industry are on course to surpass 2019 levels this year, according to a new study by clean energy lobby group Transport & Environment (T&E). Flights departing from European airports — in the EU, Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and the UK — emitted around 187.6mn t of CO2 in 2024, 8pc higher than in 2023 and just 2pc short of 2019, the year before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the study said. Meanwhile, 8.4mn flights departed from airports in Europe last year, which was 4pc lower than in 2019. T&E forecasts that aviation emissions will rise to 195.2mn t this year, 4pc higher than 2019 levels, even after taking into account a 2pc mandate on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use. European flight numbers are expected to surpass pre-pandemic levels for the first time this year. Long-haul flights emitted the most CO2 last year, with London to New York flights accounting for 1.4mn t, London to Dubai 1.2mn t and London to Singapore 1.1mn t. T&E criticised carbon pricing in Europe, pointing out that airlines do not have to pay for carbon emissions on intercontinental flights, according to EU, Swiss and UK Emissions Trading Systems (ETS), as their carbon allowances only apply to flights within Europe. This means that airlines operating within these carbon markets do not have to pay for emissions on the biggest-polluting routes. The group claims that up to 70pc of carbon emissions fell outside of these carbon markets last year and were therefore exempt. T&E is pushing the EU and UK to expand their ETS, saying they could have generated an extra €7.5bn in 2024. The EU will review its ETS next year.

Bio-bunker sales in Rotterdam down in 1Q

London, 23 April (Argus) — Sales of marine biodiesel blends in Rotterdam fell for the third consecutive quarter in January-March as demand shifted east of Suez. Port data for the first quarter of 2025 show marine biodiesel blend sales declined by 12pc compared with the previous three months and by 60pc compared with the same period last year. The decline was underpinned by lower prices in Singapore. B24 dob Singapore — a blend comprising very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) and used cooking oil methyl ester (Ucome) — averaged a $36/t discount against B30 advanced fatty acid methyl ester (Fame) 0 dob ARA in the first quarter, and a $129.74/t discount against B30 Ucome dob ARA. This price dynamic made Singapore an attractive bunker hub for those shipowners opting to use biodiesel blends to help their customers meet sustainability goals. It also attracted demand from shipowners bound by the FuelEU maritime regulations introduced in January this year. The regulations require a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships travelling into, out of and within EU waters, but energy consumed from blends bunkered in Singapore can be mass balanced to be fully accounted for under the scope of the rules. A pooling mechanism within the regulations also allows vessels operating on the east-west route to utilise compliance generated from marine biodiesel blends bunkered in Singapore across other ships that operate solely in Europe. While biodiesel bunker sales in Rotterdam fell, biomethanol sales at the port soared almost sixfold in January-March compared with a year earlier. The sharp rise in demand reflects the rollout of FuelEU Maritime , higher mandates in Europe for the use of renewables in transport this year and changes to regulations on the carryover of renewable fuels tickets in Germany and the Netherlands . Sales of conventional bunker fuels in Rotterdam edged up by a more modest 1pc on the quarter and by 7pc on the year. Sales of high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) overtook those of very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO), reversing the trend of the previous quarter despite the imminent addition of the Mediterranean Sea as an Emission Control Area (ECA). Ships without scrubbers that sail through ECA zones must use fuels with a maximum sulphur content of 0.1pc, such as marine gasoil (MGO) and ultra low sulphur fuiel oil (ULSFO). LNG bunker sales in Rotterdam fell by the 13pc on the quarter in January-March, reflecting a price rally at the Dutch TTF gas hub in late January and early February. The Argus northwest Europe LNG bunker price stood at a two-year high of €64.35/MWh on 6 February. LNG bunker sales were still higher than in the first quarter last year, which likely stems from the introduction of the FuelEU Maritime regulations.

NEa tracks first maritime CO₂ submissions

Amsterdam, 22 April (Argus) — The Netherlands Emissions Agency (NEa) has reported that shipping companies are being held financially accountable for the first time for their CO₂ emissions under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). The companies are now required to report their 2024 emissions and will have to surrender corresponding carbon allowances by 30 September. Of the 378 shipping companies assigned to the Netherlands by the European Commission, roughly 60pc met the initial 31 March deadline for submitting verified emissions reports. The group represents more than 1,400 vessels, around 75pc of which are operated by companies registered in the Netherlands and 25pc outside the EU. An additional 14pc of companies filed their reports after the deadline, bringing overall compliance to 74pc as of mid-April. NEa expects more reports to follow. Under the revised EU ETS , shippers have to surrender ETS allowances for 50pc of GHG emissions for extra-EU journeys. Surrender obligations for intra-EU shipping are phased in at 40pc of verified emissions reported for 2024, 70pc for 2025 and 100pc for 2026 onwards. From 2026, shipping firms will also have to report emissions of methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O). The EU sees the move as essential to meeting its climate targets, as shipping alone accounted for over 124mn t of CO₂ emissions in 2021, according to the commission's report.

The project marks DLC’s first power purchase agreement, boosting local energy production and economic development while making clean energy more accessible for the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania region.

The expansion will add 11,216 high-efficiency solar panels to the existing solar field, enabling the generation of an additional 4.7 MW of clean energy, and reducing carbon emissions by about 5 million pounds per year. The electricity generated from the new solar field will be supplied to the regional electric grid, providing the region with additional renewable energy and further enabling DLC’s vision of a clean-energy future.

The solar expansion is the latest energy initiative at the airport, helping maximize the property by adding to the first-in-the-world microgrid already in place. The airport also plans to produce sustainable aviation fuel on-site. The solar expansion is set to be completed in 2027 and will be located adjacent to existing solar panels just off of the airport’s exit from I-376.

“The expansion of more than 11,000 solar panels to Pittsburgh International Airport’s existing solar field is a fantastic step toward a more sustainable energy future for our region,” said Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato. “I’m thrilled that our airport is an energy leader and that our local partners in DLC and IMG are able to help make important projects like this a reality.”

The new solar project complements the airport’s existing eight-acre solar array by adding an additional 12 acres atop a closed landfill—land otherwise not suitable for development.

“Pittsburgh International Airport is an energy leader, and we are thrilled to partner with Duquesne Light Company and IMG for this important regional project,” said Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis. “We are maximizing the use of airport assets for the betterment of the region—from air service to real estate development to energy innovation and there’s more to come.”

The original eight acres contain nearly 10,000 solar panels as part of the airport’s 23-MW microgrid project, launched in 2021 as the first to completely power an airport through natural gas and solar energy. The microgrid increases resiliency and reduces costs.

“DLC is thrilled to be part of this groundbreaking project that highlights the vision of Pittsburgh International Airport as well as the strength of public-private partnerships in delivering meaningful progress for the Pittsburgh region,” said Kevin Walker, president and CEO of DLC. “By expanding access to clean energy for local homes and businesses, we’re helping to drive economic growth and bringing to life our vision of a more sustainable future for all.

World Fuel’s role in ensuring the seamless integration of SAF into easyJet’s supply chain underscores the parties’ joint commitment to developing an efficient and compliant end-to-end sustainable aviation fuel supply chain.
Arnaud Namer, co-founder and CEO of ATOBA Energy, stated: “We are proud to partner with easyJet and World Fuel, two aviation industry leaders taking bold and proactive steps to accelerate aviation’s transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuels.
By managing logistics and regulatory compliance, we work to ensure the seamless integration of sustainable aviation fuel in the market, empower producers and connect sustainability-focused customers with innovative supply.” As aviation works toward a sustainable future, ATOBA, easyJet, and World Fuel are proud to be at the forefront of this evolution.","easyJet and ATOBA Energy, in partnership with World Fuel Services, signed a MoU for the development of long-term supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel for easyJet’s operations in Europe and the UK. The agreement supports the airline’s decarbonisation strategy and is expected to unlock the SAF value chain through the combination of ATOBA’s SAF aggregation, enabling management of pricing and supply volatility risk for airlines, and World Fuel’s global jet fuel logistics, blending, storage, and distribution infrastructure.

The agreement is an important step toward scaling advanced SAF technologies and is intended to support the decarbonisation of easyJet. The SAF market is facing challenges in expanding at the rate demanded by environmental needs and regulatory mandates. While producers need long-term, stable pricing contracts to ensure a return on their investments, easyJet is seeking competitive SAF market prices in the context of a nascent industry with diverse competing technologies. This conflict of expectations currently hinders the development of SAF production projects, and ATOBA’s unique business model brings a compelling solution.

ATOBA uniquely facilitates the development of SAF production through its upstream and downstream SAF offtake portfolio management. By offtaking from diversified producers that use production technologies like Alcohol to Jet, Gas-Fischer Tropsch, or Power to Liquids, ATOBA mitigates technological and pricing risks associated with the various SAF production pathways and facilitates the closing of long-term offtake agreements among airlines, jet-fuel distributors, SAF producers, and financial institutions, which are essential for scaling the industry.

World Fuel intends to manage logistics, blending, storage and regulatory fulfillment for the EU and UK mandates. World Fuel’s role in ensuring the seamless integration of SAF into easyJet’s supply chain underscores the parties’ joint commitment to developing an efficient and compliant end-to-end sustainable aviation fuel supply chain.

Raminder Shergill, Director of Tax & Fuel Strategy at easyJet commented: “We are deeply committed to fostering the growth of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel industry and are thrilled to see ATOBA introduce their innovative approach to catalysing the development of the SAF market. By addressing the long-term offtake challenges that have hindered investment in SAF projects, ATOBA’s approach paves the way for accelerated industry expansion, greater investment confidence, and credible pricing and supply security for easyJet”.

Arnaud Namer, co-founder and CEO of ATOBA Energy, stated: “We are proud to partner with easyJet and World Fuel, two aviation industry leaders taking bold and proactive steps to accelerate aviation’s transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuels. With their expertise in highly efficient operational cost management, they are setting a strong precedent for the industry. We are excited to support their transition through our SAF aggregation services, providing airlines with long-term competitive advantages as they shift toward more sustainable fuels.”

SAFFiRE Renewables was purchased by Southwest Airlines just over one year ago, in March 2024.
SAFFiRE Renewables is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Airlines Renewable Ventures (SARV), which is itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Airlines.
According to its most recent annual report, Southwest Airlines spent $5.8 billion on fuel in 2024, which accounted for 21.4% of its operating expenses.
In 2024 Southwest consumed 2.19 billion gallons of fuel, according to the company’s annual report.","The divestment comes at the behest of activist investor Elliott Investment Management, sources said, a group that has recently brought about a slew of changes to longtime policies at Southwest – such as introducing assigned seating and charging for luggage.

The activist investor “has come in and demanded that all SAF purchases have to be at parity with the cost of jet fuel, full stop,” one source said. “It kneecaps their ability to source SAF.”

“They’re shopping around SAFFiRE Renewables, trying to sell it,” a second source said. SAFFiRE Renewables was purchased by Southwest Airlines just over one year ago, in March 2024.

SAFFiRE is currently building a pilot SAF production plant near Liberal, Kansas, that will produce very low carbon intensity cellulosic ethanol from corn stover, which can be used to produce SAF via the alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) pathway.

The Kansas pilot plant project is supported by the US Department of Energy and uses technology from the DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The original plan was for SAFFiRE’s cellulosic ethanol to be converted into SAF by LanzaJet, which is in the process of starting up a commercial-sized AtJ pilot plant near Soperton, Georgia.

SAFFiRE Renewables is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Airlines Renewable Ventures (SARV), which is itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Airlines. One source thought that SARV could also be brought to an end, but this point was less certain.

When Southwest purchased SAFFiRE last year, Bob Jordan, Southwest’s chief executive officer, said that “championing SAF is a key pillar of Southwest’s Nonstop to Net Zero plan and our work toward a sustainable future for air travel.”

Southwest continues to procure SAF

When asked, Southwest Airlines did not comment on the divestment from SAFFiRE Renewables, but stated, “Southwest continues to procure SAF and most recently signed a SAF offtake agreement with Prime Energy for 1.7 million gallons of SAF annually for a five-year deal, effective once Prime begins production.”

Prime Energy is an agreement between Norway’s Prime Capital and renewable energy company RES to build an e-SAF production plant in northern Sweden. No time frame has been announced for the completion of this plant.

The comment from Southwest further stated that it is “seeking deals that align with our transformational efforts.”

Southwest has a standing agreement with Valero Energy from October 2024 to purchase a minimum of 3.6 million gallons of neat SAF over a two-year period, with delivery at Chicago Midway International Airport. The airline uses about 240 million gallons of fuel at Chicago Midway each year, according to its own press releases.

According to its most recent annual report, Southwest Airlines spent $5.8 billion on fuel in 2024, which accounted for 21.4% of its operating expenses. This percentage is the second lowest reported by Southwest in fifteen years, only slightly higher than the one given for 2020, when global air travel was significantly affected by the outbreak of the Covid pandemic. Fuel has been declining as a percentage of annual operating expenses for Southwest since 2011, when it accounted for 38% of expenditures.

In the same report, the company said “even a small change in market fuel prices can significantly affect profitability.” Within the report, the company also gave extensive reasoning for why its ability to utilize SAF could be limited, and that the company may instead use carbon offsets to achieve mandatory climate obligations or voluntary climate goals.

Originally a government-sponsored project, Heart Aerospace was founded by CEO Anders Forslund in 2018, and has received investment from Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, the EIC fund, EQT Ventures and Norrsken VC, among others.

But the company has struggled to crack Europe, resulting in its latest decision to focus on America. ""As our customers, partners, and investors are increasingly based in the US, we see greater opportunity in focusing our resources here,” said CEO and cofounder Forslund in a statement.

The move means the 75 employees based in Sweden will either have to find a new employer or apply for a few specialist roles the company plans to fill with former Swedish employees with cutting-edge expertise.

Forslund has already moved to Los Angeles, alongside cofounder and wife Klara Forslund, to oversee the company’s US operations. The company relocated its R&D center and its full-scale aircraft demonstrator to the area last year.

Heart Aerospace has raised another $40m

Following Heart’s $107m Series B in 2024, the hybrid plane startup has also raised another $40m earlier this spring, according to the company statement.

Forslund describes how grateful he is for the team and the support he has received in Sweden, however, by focusing fully on the US, “we can accelerate development, strengthen collaboration, and better position Heart Aerospace for the future,"" he said.

Heart’s hybrid 30-seater plane is scheduled to take to the air in 2025.

In the first few years, the company planned to build a 19-seater electric plane, but in 2022, the plan for the smaller plane was scrapped to focus on a 30-seater plane, the ES-30, which will be able to take passengers 200km (from Brussels to Amsterdam, for example) on electric power, and double that distance — Paris to Munich — with hybrid-electric.

Heart Aerospace backed by US Airlines

Whilst Norway aims to operate all short- and medium-haul flights with electric planes by 2040, the rest of Europe hasn’t been as forthcoming about the new technology.

In recent years, discussions at the European Parliament have been focused on increasing the proportion of fuel in planes that comes from biomaterials instead of focus on new technologies, such as electric or hydrogen, according to Simon McNamara, director of government and industry affairs at Heart.

“Within Europe there is a big political focus on SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) as the solution to meeting the sector target of net zero by 2050, but the reality is that SAF will only get us around 70% of the way there under any net zero roadmaps,” McNamara said last year.

Outside of Europe, things have been rosier for Heart. In July 2021, American airlines Mesa and United Airlines invested in Heart and put in an order for 200 planes. A year later, Air Canada put in an order for 30 and Air New Zealand is also working with Heart.

It isn’t clear if Europe’s reduced interest in electric or hydrogen driven planes played a part in Heart’s move to the US. However, as in the case of Heart, most startups pick revenue creation over less soft questions such as Europe as its tech hub.","https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/01103439/Heart-aerospace-es-30.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=75&fit=crop&auto=compress,format",N,,2025-04-30 05:56:50.277663

“This is Thailand’s first fully integrated Neat SAF production facility,” said Mr. Chaiwat Kovavisarach, Group CEO and President of Bangchak Corporation.
In addition to Neat SAF, the unit also produces Bio-LPG and Bio-Naphtha as byproducts.
This development positions Bangchak as a regional leader in clean aviation fuel and aligns with broader national and global carbon reduction goals.","In a landmark step toward decarbonizing aviation, Bangchak Group has officially launched Thailand’s first Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Production Unit at its Phra Khanong Refinery. Operated by BSGF Company Limited, a Bangchak affiliate, the unit is the country’s first dedicated facility capable of producing 100% Neat SAF at scale, marking a pivotal moment in Thailand’s clean energy journey.

The facility, which began Plant Performance Test Runs in April, boasts an initial daily capacity of 1 million liters. Using Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, it transforms used cooking oil and other fatty acid feedstocks into ASTM-compliant aviation fuel. The SAF unit operates under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) scheme, overseeing the entire value chain—from raw material procurement to distribution.

“This is Thailand’s first fully integrated Neat SAF production facility,” said Mr. Chaiwat Kovavisarach, Group CEO and President of Bangchak Corporation. “It exemplifies our commitment to energy innovation and reinforces our position as a pioneer in future energy solutions.”

The project was developed in collaboration with Desmet (Belgium) for pretreatment processes and UOP Honeywell (USA) for advanced hydroprocessing technology, ensuring rigorous quality control from hydrogenation to molecular restructuring and fuel fractionation.

In addition to Neat SAF, the unit also produces Bio-LPG and Bio-Naphtha as byproducts.

Globally, SAF is emerging as a key lever in reducing aviation emissions, which currently account for roughly 492 million tons of CO₂ annually, according to the IEA and ICAO. SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%, offering a scalable, cost-effective alternative to conventional jet fuels. Countries like the EU, UK, and Singapore have already introduced SAF blending mandates, and Thailand is currently reviewing similar regulations.

Beyond climate benefits, SAF contributes to improved air quality. Its low sulfur and aromatic content helps reduce PM2.5 emissions and mitigates acid rain risks.

Bangchak’s SAF initiative builds on two decades of experience in renewable energy. The journey began in 2000 with biodiesel R&D in partnership with the Royal Thai Naval Dockyard, followed by the country’s first commercial biodiesel launch in 2004. In 2008, Bangchak introduced a used cooking oil buy-back program to secure community-based feedstock.

Today, through its “Fry to Fly” campaign, Bangchak collects used cooking oil at over 290 service stations nationwide, with plans to expand to 2,000 locations by the end of 2025. The company is also preparing to introduce a Book & Claim system, enabling verified carbon credit claims for SAF usage by airlines and passengers—a move aimed at accelerating sustainable aviation adoption.

Operated by BSGF Company Limited, a Bangchak Group affiliate, the unit complies with rigorous international certification standards, reinforcing the Group’s commitment to green innovation and its evolution from a renewable energy leader to a pioneer of future energy solutions.

Mr Chaiwat Kovavisarach, Group Chief Executive Officer and President of Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited, stated that this is Thailand’s first fully integrated standalone Neat SAF production facility. The unit oversees the entire value chain—from feedstock procurement and processing to product distribution—under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) scheme. With an initial production capacity of 1 million litres per day, the facility employs Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, converting fatty acids and vegetable oils, such as used cooking oil, into high-quality SAF.

The production process was developed in collaboration with two global technology leaders: Desmet of Belgium, specialising in pretreatment technologies, and UOP Honeywell of the United States, a pioneer in hydroprocessing systems. This collaboration ensures quality control across all stages, including feedstock handling, hydrogenation, molecular restructuring, and fractionation, resulting in SAF that meets ASTM aviation fuel standards. The facility primarily produces Neat SAF, with by-products such as Bio-LPG and Bio-Naphtha, and is currently undergoing Plant Performance Test Runs.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the aviation sector emits around 492 million tonnes of CO₂ annually, despite accounting for only 2.9% of global energy consumption. SAF is therefore a critical component in global decarbonisation strategies, capable of reducing aviation emissions by up to 80%—a more cost-effective and impactful solution compared to other available technologies. Several countries have introduced SAF blending mandates, including the EU (2% by 2025 and 6% by 2030), the UK (2% by 2025 and 10% by 2030), and Singapore (1% by 2026 and 5% by 2030). Thailand is currently considering the introduction of a similar mandate.

Beyond its carbon reduction benefits, SAF significantly improves air quality. It contains minimal aromatic compounds—substances linked to serious health risks, including cancer—and extremely low levels of sulphur, helping to reduce particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions and mitigate the risk of acid rain.

This initiative underscores Bangchak’s leadership in energy innovation, building on more than 20 years of experience in renewable energy. The journey began in 2000 with a collaboration with the Royal Thai Naval Dockyard to develop a biodiesel plant using used cooking oil for the Royal Chitralada Projects, followed by Thailand’s first commercial biodiesel offering at Bangchak service stations in 2004. In 2008, Bangchak launched a used cooking oil buy-back programme from communities and networks, reinforcing its position as a national leader in renewable energy.

Today, Bangchak moves further into the future of clean energy with Neat SAF, emphasising sustainability across its entire supply chain. Through the ""Fry to Fly"" campaign, the public can sell used cooking oil at over 290 Bangchak service stations nationwide, with a target to expand to 2,000 stations by the end of 2025. The company is also building partnerships across the public and private sectors to ensure long-term feedstock security and is preparing to implement a Book & Claim system—a mechanism adopted by leading global organisations—that will allow passengers and airlines to claim SAF usage and receive verified carbon reduction credits, accelerating the transition to sustainable aviation in a tangible and scalable way.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20250429/c1_3014052_700.jpg,N,,2025-04-30 05:56:59.059511

MYTH: SAF is too expensive for my business Yes, SAF requires investment and it is something that needs to be budgeted for.","Aviation accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, a figure projected to triple by 2050 without intervention making it a key sector for decarbonisation.

As businesses around the world accelerate their sustainability commitments, many global organisations – particularly those with international operations where aviation and corporate travel remain essential for connectivity – are turning to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as a critical pathway to reduce their carbon footprint.

While emerging technologies such as hydrogen and electric aircraft hold long-term promise, SAF is currently the most viable and scalable option for reducing aviation emissions.

Made from 100% renewable waste and residue materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste, SAF can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to fossil jet fuel. Crucially, it’s a drop-in fuel, meaning it can be used in existing aircrafts without requiring any modifications to current infrastructure.

This year, the UK has made strides in supporting SAF adoption, becoming one of the first countries to implement a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate.

Rachel Reeves’ Heathrow Expansion announcement further reinforced this momentum, highlighting a commitment to increasing investment in SAF production. However, widespread adoption remains slow, with SAF still accounting for less than 1% of total aviation fuel usage globally

So, what’s holding businesses back? To help companies integrate SAF investment into their ESG strategies, it’s crucial to address some of the most common misconceptions about SAF and its role in reducing emissions.

MYTH: SAF is difficult to understand

Many businesses still struggle to understand the role SAF plays in decarbonisation, but the concept is actually quite simple.

While carbon offsetting addresses the impact of GHG emissions – typically by compensating for emissions through carbon credits – investment in SAF results in a direct reduction of CO2e.It is based on simple mathematics. For every tonne-equivalent of SAF purchased, a tonne less fossil fuel (and its associated emissions) is required.

Therefore, for businesses that cannot easily avoid or reduce their air travel, SAF should be a key component in their Scope 3 sustainability strategy.

MYTH: It is not businesses’ responsibility to decarbonise aviation

It is easy for business leaders to assume that decarbonising the aviation industry is solely the responsibility of airlines or governments. However, this mindset overlooks the fact that businesses are among the largest consumers of air travel, especially when it comes to corporate mobility, international meetings and global supply chains. As key drivers of demand, businesses share responsibility – and a powerful opportunity – to accelerate the aviation industry’s widespread adoption of SAF.

Corporate buyers can play a pivotal role in this transition by incorporating SAF into their travel programmes. This can include setting concreate emissions reduction targets to track and reduce the impact of business travel, integrating SAF into travel programmes for immediate and credible emissions reductions, and use carbon measurement tools to monitor travel activity and inform sustainability decisions.

What’s more, corporate travel policies can align SAF procurement alongside other sustainability initiatives, such as optimising travel schedules, reducing unnecessary trips and investing in verified offset programmes to address residual unavoidable emissions.

MYTH: It is difficult to identify credible SAF sources

Identifying a credible SAF provider is critical as it ensures the product is made from 100% waste materials, such as used cooking oils and animal fats.

Fortunately, credible purchases are always registered under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC). This certification guarantees transparency, ensuring no green-washing or double-dipping of who is claiming CO2e reductions. Plus, this registry entry and certification process provides a clear audit trail ensuring businesses know the source is legitimate.

Additionally, many credible suppliers offer “Book & Claim” investment options, making SAF accessible to businesses regardless of their physical flight path. Businesses can benefit from their SAF investment, without creating a heavier emissions footprint by requiring SAF to be provided to their specific flight locations.

MYTH: SAF supply is low, so it’s not worth investing

While it is true that SAF isn’t available at the scale needed to fuel the entire aviation industry, there is enough to support a significant increase in current uptake. Today, SAF makes up only a small fraction of the global aviation fuel mix, highlighting not a limitation, but a clear opportunity for growth.

As with most emerging products, demand drives price. If businesses hold back on investment due to concerns about supply, producers will have less incentive to scale up. But when demand increases, it sends a strong signal to the market. The quicker corporates, airlines and governments commit to SAF, the sooner we’ll see production expand and prices begin to fall.

In short, supply may be limited for now but it is more than enough to get started, and the sooner we act, the faster the industry evolves.

MYTH: SAF is too expensive for my business

Yes, SAF requires investment and it is something that needs to be budgeted for. However a good Travel Management Company (TMC), can help businesses understand exactly how much SAF is needed to reduce their Scope 3 aviation emissions by a specific percentage. This insight provides the foundation for cost modelling, which in turn can be integrated into a travel programme.

There are many flexible ways to incorporate SAF costs, from carbon pricing to internal recharges based on departmental emissions. While reducing 10% of aviation emissions may seem costly upfront, spreading the cost at the point of sale can make it much more manageable.

And as with any emerging solution, increasing demand will help reduce costs. The more businesses that invest now, the sooner we will see SAF become more economically viable at scale.

Investing in SAF isn’t just a commitment to sustainability – it’s a commitment to strengthening your business and making a strategic move for long-term impact. By taking action now, companies can drive meaningful change and help shape a lower-carbon, secure future for aviation.",https://thebusinesstravelmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iStock-1629372839.jpg,N,,2025-04-29 21:57:10.515507

According to the company, total vegetable oil throughput for the first quarter was approximately 156,000 gallons per day, compared to approximately 76,000 gallons per day during the same period of last year.

Renewables margin was $16 million, or $1.13 per vegetable oil throughput gallon, for the first quarter, compared to $4 million, or 65 cents per vegetable oil throughput gallon, for the same period of 2024. CVR Energy said factors contributing to the improved margin include higher net sales of $33 million resulting from increased production and sales volumes coupled with increased D4 renewable identification number (RIN) and Low Carbon Fuel Standard credit prices, partially offset by a decrease in average CARB ULSD prices of 26 cents per gallon. Higher net sales were partially offset by higher costs of sales of $22 million due to an increase in throughput and production volumes.

CVR Energy indicated that the renewables segment reported first quarter net income of $1 million and EBITDA of $6 million, compared to a net loss of $10 million and EBITDA loss of $4 million for the same period of last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the renewables segment was $3 million, compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $5 million.

During an earnings call held April 29, CVR Energy Chief Financial Officer Dane Neumann said renewable fuels throughput volumes are expected to increase during the second quarter, reaching between 16 and 20 million gallons, up from an estimated 14 million gallons during the first quarter.

David Lamp, CEO of CVR Energy, said the company continues to evaluate whether its participation in the renewables business makes sense. As previously stated, Lamp said the company remains fully willing to participate in the renewables space, but cannot invest additional time and capital without further assurance from the government that it will support the businesses its policies have created.

CVR Energy previously disclosed it was considering plans to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), both at the Wynnewood refinery and the company’s Coffeyville refinery in Kansas. During a fourth quarter earning call held in February, Lamp said the company would need clarity on the availability and durability of government subsidies before it invests any additional capital into the proposed projects. He reiterated those sentiments during the first quarter call, stressing the company has learned through its experience in the renewables space that you can’t count on tax credits. To move forward with any additional SAF or renewable diesel projects, CVR Energy would need to partner with someone willing to take on that risk.

Neste currently has 1.5 million metric tons of SAF capacity in place, including the recent addition of 500,000 metric tons of SAF capacity at Rotterdam.","Neste Corp. released first quarter financial results on April 29, reporting improved renewable fuel demand and increased sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. Margins, however, were low and feedstock costs were high.

The comparable sales margin for renewables fell to $310 per ton during the first quarter of 2025, down from $562 per ton reported for the same period of last year. Neste primarily attributed the decline to global overcapacity that affected prices and strong feedstock demand, which kept input prices high.

Production at all of Neste’s biorefineries was stable during the quarter, and SAF production at the Rotterdam facility ramped up as planned, according to the company. Neste’s own renewables production facilities operated an average utilization rate of 79% during the three-month period, down from 88% during the first quarter of 2024, as production volumes were optimized. The share of waste and residue inputs was 97%, up from 91%.

Total renewable fuels production reached 1.11 million metric tons during the fourth quarter, including 877,000 metric tons of renewable diesel, 207,000 metric tons of SAF and 29,000 metric tons of other products. Total renewable fuels production during the same period of last year was at 1.14 million metric tons, including 933,000 metric tons of renewable diesel, 167,000 metric tons of SAF and 35,000 metric tons of other products.

Neste sold 892,000 metric tons of renewable fuels during the first quarter, up from 849,000 metric tons during the same period of 2024. SAF accounted for 130,000 metric tons of that volume, up from 41,000 metric tons.

During the first quarter, approximately 69% of renewable diesel and SAF volumes were sold into the European market, up from 51% during the same period of last year. Only 31% of sales volumes were destined for North America, down from 49%.

Neste said U.S. biobased diesel production was subdued during the first quarter, citing reduced run rates as a result of prolonged regulatory uncertainty and the changing tax credit structure. In Europe, renewable diesel market tightness eased during the three-month period as refineries returned to production following outages.

According to Neste President and CEO Heikki Malinen, comparable EBITDA for renewable products fell to EUR 72 million during the first quarter, down from $242 million during the same period of last year. He primarily attributed the decline to weaker margins. Malinen also noted that Neste’s SAF sales are expected to increase towards the end of 2025, reflecting the seasonality of demand and the SAF annual mandate structure.

Malinen briefly discussed Neste’s ongoing expansion project at its biorefinery in Rotterdam, noting the project is proceeding according to the updated plan. When complete in 2027, the biorefinery is expected to be the world’s largest facility production renewable diesel and SAF, he said. Neste currently has 1.5 million metric tons of SAF capacity in place, including the recent addition of 500,000 metric tons of SAF capacity at Rotterdam.

For the full year 2025, Neste currently predicts that renewable products sales volumes will be higher than last year.

This hydrogen is essential for the hydrotreatment of bio-oil, removing oxygen and refining the product to meet the strict quality requirements of aviation fuels.","Mika Järvinen, Associate Professor at Aalto University, explains how Circular Fuels is working to close the loop in sustainable aviation.

As the climate crisis reaches higher altitudes and the pressure to decarbonise soars, the aviation industry faces a choice: innovate or risk a turbulent future.

Responsible for 14.4% of the EU’s transport-related emissions, air travel remains one of the most carbon-intensive sectors and one of the hardest to decarbonise.

While electric vehicles are becoming increasingly mainstream for road transport, the dream of battery-powered long-haul flights remains distant.

The aviation sector remains dependant almost entirely on fossil fuels, contributing greatly to our current climate crisis. We must cut these carbon emissions in order to reduce our impact on the planet.

In Europe, there has been some movement towards a fossil free future in recent years. In 2021, the EU presented the Fit for 55 plan aiming to cut greenhouse gas emissions by a 55% reduction by 2030 in comparison to 1990 levels.

To help reach this target, they also introduced initiatives aiming to boost the use of cleaner aviation fuels and reduce the environmental impact.

After discussions throughout 2022 and 2023, EU leaders and the European Parliament finally reached an agreement, and the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation was officially adopted in October 2023.

The solution is clear. To advance aviation and reach these ambitious targets set by the EU, we must take a more radical approach rooted in the circular economy principles.

Closing the loop in sustainable aviation

Launched in 2023, with the backing of the EU’s Green New Deal and CORDIS initiatives, the Circular Fuels project is redefining how sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) can be developed, scaled, and integrated into our global energy system.

Not only does this project present technological upgrades, it also offers a systems-level rethinking, bringing circularity to the skies by integrating renewable energy, waste-based inputs, and zero-emission processes into a closed-loop model.

At its core, Circular Fuels is built on the foundation of circularity. Rather than relying on extractive, linear production chains that take, make, and waste, this project takes a regenerative approach.

Waste materials, including agricultural residues and forestry byproducts, are transformed into valuable bio-oils, which are then refined into high-quality, drop-in aviation fuels.

But the innovation doesn’t stop at feedstock. The process is powered entirely by solar energy, both through photovoltaic (PV) electricity and concentrated solar thermal systems.

Parabolic mirrors harness solar heat to generate temperatures over 3000°C, which are then funnelled into pyrolysis reactors that convert biomass into bio-oil. This heat production involves no combustion, meaning no carbon emissions. It’s a major leap forward in sustainable energy practices.

Meanwhile, solar PV powers PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) electrolysers are used to produce green hydrogen from water. This hydrogen is essential for the hydrotreatment of bio-oil, removing oxygen and refining the product to meet the strict quality requirements of aviation fuels.

Every step in the process is deliberately designed with circularity in mind to eliminate waste, close energy loops, and minimise environmental impact.

The implications of this model extend far beyond fuel production. From agriculture to energy, this initiative is setting a precedent for how entire sectors can integrate circularity into their operations.

For farmers and biomass producers, this means new revenue streams from agricultural waste that would otherwise be discarded or burned, as well as offering municipalities an opportunity to reduce local biomass waste whilst contributing to EU-wide climate targets.

In sectors, such as solar and hydrogen, the project creates synergy, turning intermittent renewable energy into stable, high-value products. For aviation companies and passengers, it paves the way towards low-emission air travel without sacrificing performance.

Alongside this list of benefits, the project provides policy recommendations and economic models to ensure that these technologies are not only environmentally sound, but commercially viable.

It’s a powerful reminder that circular solutions must be scalable and sustainable across social, economic, and environmental dimensions.

Circular Fuels is tightly aligned with the EU’s Fit for 55 package and RefuelEU Aviation regulation, aiming to ensure 2% SAF usage in EU airports by 2025, scaling up to 70% by 2050.

Crucially, the project focuses on advanced biofuels made from waste, as opposed to crop based biofuels which often compete with food production and degrade land quality.

Not all renewables are created equal

This is important to distinguish as not all renewables are created equal.

Crop-based biofuels can reproduce some of the extractive dynamics of fossil fuels. In contrast, Circular Fuels taps into truly regenerative resources, turning what was once waste into a product that displaces fossil kerosene, one of the aviation sector’s most polluting fuels.

It’s a blueprint for how circular economy principles can drive deep decarbonisation in even the most emissions-heavy industries.

By integrating clean energy, waste valorisation, cross-sector partnerships, and policy alignment, this initiative demonstrates how circularity can become a powerful engine for innovation and sustainability.

In a world that urgently needs scalable climate solutions, we need more than hope – we need action. With solar-powered, waste-based jet fuel on the horizon, the skies may soon be a lot cleaner thanks to the on-going hard work taking place here on the ground.",https://www.circularonline.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iStock-1629372839-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-29 18:56:43.920390

President Ron Kindred of the Illinois Soybean Association hosted soon-to-be senatorial candidate Raja Krishnamoorthi on his Logan County farm last Thursday. During that meeting, they spoke about biofuels and Trump trade tariffs.

“We are the number one soybean producing state in the United States, so soybeans are near and dear to our heart and I think now, these associations are more important than ever to that farmers and tell our story,” Kindred said. “One thing we’re focusing on as a soybean association is trying to grow our domestic market, so we’re less reliant on trade and having to move our product overseas. The biofuel market is an excellent place that we can grow, especially with the sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel, biodiesel. It’s an excellent arena for us to grow some of our domestic markets, which in turn lowers the price of soybean meal.”

In his first public remarks on the Trump administration's policies, Bonnie told the North American Agricultural Journalists (NAAJ) at their spring Washington meeting that he is particularly worried about the loss of key personnel.

""I am very concerned. I know many people in agriculture are, that USDA is being severely weakened right now, severely weakened as an institution to serve agriculture, to serve the American people, to serve food production,"" Bonnie told reporters.

While full details have not been announced, USDA is expected to make significant cuts to staffing across agencies. USDA has pitched multiple plans to employees for a deferred resignation program to end their employment but pay them through the end of the fiscal year. Employees have been told to expect more ""reduction in force"" cuts along with consolidation in offices around the country.

A USDA employee in Washington told DTN he was retiring from the department this week because he did not want to be responsible for firing his long-time colleagues.

DTN reached out to USDA's public affairs office for comment on Bonnie's statements, but did not receive an immediate response on Tuesday.

Bonnie said he is prohibited from having direct contact with USDA officials for two years due to the ethics agreement he signed when he took his presidentially appointed and Senate confirmed post. He has learned that Tim Griffiths, the national coordinator of the Natural Resource Conservation Service's sage grouse initiative, left USDA on Friday.

An email to Griffiths' NRCS address in Montana on Monday resulted in the following automated reply: ""I am sorry, but I am no longer available."" The response directed senders to another USDA official and ended with ""Your friend in conservation. Tim.""

Bonnie noted Griffith helped develop a 15-year initiative, ""arguably one of the most important landscape level conservation initiatives,"" covering more than 9 million acres and ""a couple thousand ranchers, all voluntary, all incentive based,"" pointing out how controversial it was to develop the sage grouse program. Bonnie said it was terrible for USDA to lose ""that type of leadership, creativity. Tim is one of many people lost.""

Bonnie also said that 75% of the federal government's wildfire response ""sits at USDA,"" and that he is worried as the summer fire season approaches, the Forest Service is ""going to lose senior people, the number of teams will be reduced.""

Bonnie also raised concerns about USDA's established relationships with conservation groups such as Ducks Unlimited that could be setback as well because of cuts.

Bonnie, who developed the Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities during the Biden administration, also noted that during the Obama administration farmers ""ran the other way from climate policy,"" but during the Biden years, the government and the farmers worked together on agriculture and forestry.

Now, he said, there is ""resistance"" to the Trump administration's holds on Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities grants.

The Trump administration has changed the partnerships initiative into the Advancing Markets for Producers (AMP) initiative, and Bonnie has said he hopes that the administration will follow through on the original goals.

But he said the Trump administration's decision to require groups that had already been made partners and gotten grants to reapply to continue in the program will slow down development and create uncertainty.

Bonnie said he also worried about the impact of cutting back on USDA programs under the Inflation Reduction Act, and the loss of U.S. international leadership.

He also noted that the first Trump administration had pulled a dozen senior USDA executives from agencies into the business center it created, and that the Biden administration had to ""piece"" back together management in the various agencies. The current Trump administration organizational changes are on a much bigger scale, he said.

On biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel, other departments are also involved, he said.

Bonnie noted a trip to FarmFest last year in Minnesota where farmers were focused on reducing the carbon intensity of biofuels.

""They see value for their operations. They see markets for their operations,"" Bonnie said.

The final guidance for the 45Z tax credit for biofuels was not completed because officials in an interagency process wanted to further examine a carbon calculator, but if the Treasury Department would put in place the peer review process established by the Biden administration, ""Farmers would be off the races on sustainable aviation fuel,"" Bonnie said.

But Bonnie said he is worried about the loss of leadership in all the agencies that play a role in biofuels. The linkage between those agencies is guidance around greenhouse gas reporting and emissions. If the Environmental Protection Agency, the Energy Department and the Transportation Department each pull back on carbon emissions, ""farmers are going to pay the price,"" he said.

Taking place from its test facility in Marina, California using the company’s newest aircraft (N544JX), the first crewed transition flight was performed on 22 April with chief test pilot James Denham at the controls.

“The aircraft flew exactly as expected, with excellent handling qualities and low pilot workload,” says Denham.

It has since carried out “multiple transition flights with three different pilots at the controls”, the developer says, an industry first.

Joby in 2017 conducted remotely piloted transition flights using a full-scale prototype.

Didier Papadopolous, president of aircraft OEM at Joby, says the successful testing “demonstrates the high level of confidence we have in the performance of the aircraft as we prepare for commercial service in Dubai” - a milestone expected later this year.

Joby says it “remains on track” to deliver an aircraft to Dubai by mid-year “to complete flight testing ahead of first passenger flights in the region”.

In addition, Papadopolous says the transition testing “paves the way” for the start of US Federal Aviation Administration Type Inspection Authorization flights with the agency’s pilots on board, a crucial step in the certification process.

Ahead of the piloted transition flights, Joby carried out extensive ground testing of the aircraft’s hardware in its Integrated Test Lab, alongside a series of remotely-piloted flight tests at Edwards AFB designed to simulate critical failures such as motor- or battery-out events.

“In all cases, the aircraft performed as expected, enabling Joby pilots to continue safe flight and a controlled, vertical landing, even when relying on just four of the aircraft’s six propellers,” it says.

The expansion will add 11,216 high-efficiency solar panels to the existing solar field, adding 4.7 MW of clean energy.
The solar expansion is set to be completed in 2027 and will be located adjacent to existing solar panels just off of the airport’s exit from I-376.
“The expansion of more than 11,000 solar panels to Pittsburgh International Airport’s existing solar field is a fantastic step toward a more sustainable energy future for our region,” said Sara Innamorato, Allegheny County executive.
News item from Pittsburgh International Airport","Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT), in partnership with Duquesne Light Company (DLC) and IMG Energy Solutions, a Liberty Energy company, is planning an expansion of its solar field as part of the airport’s energy innovation plans. The project marks DLC’s first power purchase agreement, making clean energy more accessible for the Pittsburgh region.

The expansion will add 11,216 high-efficiency solar panels to the existing solar field, adding 4.7 MW of clean energy. The electricity generated from the new solar field will be supplied to the regional electric grid.

The solar expansion is the latest energy initiative at PIT that increases the use of its property, adding to its existing on-site microgrid, the first of its kind, and plans to produce sustainable aviation fuel on-site. The solar expansion is set to be completed in 2027 and will be located adjacent to existing solar panels just off of the airport’s exit from I-376.

“The expansion of more than 11,000 solar panels to Pittsburgh International Airport’s existing solar field is a fantastic step toward a more sustainable energy future for our region,” said Sara Innamorato, Allegheny County executive. “I’m thrilled that our airport is an energy leader and that our local partners in DLC and IMG are able to help make important projects like this a reality.”

The new solar project complements the airport’s existing eight-acre solar array by adding an additional 12 acres atop a closed landfill – land otherwise not suitable for development.

“Pittsburgh International Airport is an energy leader, and we are thrilled to partner with Duquesne Light Company and IMG for this important regional project,” said Christina Cassotis, CEO of PIT. “We are maximizing the use of airport assets for the betterment of the region — from air service to real estate development to energy innovation, and there’s more to come.”

The original eight acres contain nearly 10,000 solar panels as part of the airport’s 23-MW microgrid project, launched in 2021 as the first to completely power an airport through natural gas and solar energy. The microgrid increases the airports energy resiliency and reduces costs.

“DLC is thrilled to be part of this groundbreaking project that highlights the vision of Pittsburgh International Airport as well as the strength of public-private partnerships in delivering meaningful progress for the Pittsburgh region,” said Kevin Walker, president and CEO of DLC. “By expanding access to clean energy for local homes and businesses, we’re helping to drive economic growth and bringing to life our vision of a more sustainable future for all. This project represents an important step in delivering more renewable energy to our communities, friends and neighbors.”

The expanded solar field will be owned and operated by IMG, with a commitment to supply 100% of its generated energy, along with the renewable energy credits, to DLC. This agreement ensures that DLC can utilize the clean energy to support the electricity needs of its default service customers who do not actively select an electricity supplier outside of DLC.

“IMG is excited to build on the success of the Pittsburgh International Airport microgrid, which combines high-efficiency thermal generation with a utility-scale solar array, by more than doubling our existing solar energy production,” said Mike Brady, VP of power generation execution at Liberty Energy.

It is expected to unlock the SAF value chain through a combination of ATOBA’s SAF aggregation, enabling pricing management and supply volatility risk for airlines.

World Fuel will manage logistics, blending, storage and regulatory fulfillment for the EU and UK mandates.

The SAF market is facing challenges when it comes to expanding at the rate demanded by environmental needs and regulatory mandates.

While producers need long-term, stable pricing contracts to ensure ROI, easyJet is looking for competitive SAF market prices in the context of a nascent industry with competing technologies.

ATOBA facilitates the development of SAF production through its upstream and downstream SAF offtake portfolio management.

By offtaking from producers that use technologies such as Alcohol to Jet, Gas-Fischer Tropsch or Power to Liquids, ATOBA mitigates technological and pricing risks associated with various SAF production pathways.

It also facilitates the closing of long-term offtake agreements amongst airlines, jet fuel distributors, SAF producers and financial institutions, which are essential for scaling the industry.

Raminder Shergill, Director of Tax & Fuel Strategy at easyJet, said: “We are committed to fostering the growth of the SAF industry and are thrilled to see ATOBA introduce its innovative approach to catalysing the development of the SAF market.

Outlining its earnings for the January-March 2025 period on 29 April, the Oneworld carrier described the operating environment during those three months as “tough”, featuring a €22 million ($25 million) impact on its comparable operating result from the action taken by the Finnish Airline Pilots’ Association, SSL. There was also a €10 million impact from a mandated increase in sustainable aviation fuel useage and changes to the European Union’s Emissions Trading System.

But Finnair notes that travel demand “remained healthy” during the quarter and says that it expects a decision on 30 April on another proposal to bring the industrial action by SSL members to an end.

The 230 flights it has removed from its summer schedule will not be reinstated under any circumstances, however, and it estimates those cancellations will have a further €10 million impact on its comparable operating result for the year.

Moreover, Finnair announced on 28 April that it would furlough nearly 40 long-haul pilots for at least eight months in relation to the continuing dispute over its wet-lease operation for Oneworld partner Qantas, which has prompted the latter to cut its use of the European carrier’s Airbus A330 twinjets over concerns about the “reliability” of service being provided amid the industrial action.

Moreover, the business is now facing fresh uncertainties, Finnair says in its outlook.

“The threat of trade wars and uncertainty related to economic development have increased significantly, which may weaken demand,” states chief executive Turkka Kuusisto.

Finnair says it will update its full-year guidance – including the impact of industrial action – at the half-year stage, and that its focus remains on “securing profitability”, aided by lower fuel costs.

The carrier’s first-quarter revenue of €694 million was up 1.9% year on year, on a 2.3% rise in passenger capacity and a 4.6% rise in traffic.

Its comparable operating loss deepened by around €50 million to €62.6 million, while its net loss increased by around €20 million to €50.8 million.

The cities of Burien, Des Moines, Federal Way, Normandy Park, SeaTac, and Tukwila make up what is known as the Highline region of Washington state. Named after the well-known High Line Road that connected Tacoma and Seattle in the early 1900’s, Highline has since been used to describe the diverse and thriving region in southwest King County that sits between two of the state’s largest cities.

Located among those six cities is one of the largest gateways to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA). In fact, much of the Highline region’s population growth has in part related to the airport and other major aviation industry activity. To that end, the Highline Forum has been a key venue over the last two decades for facilitating connection between the airport and the local community through open dialogue about priorities, issues, and concerns — ranging from aircraft noise and land stewardship efforts to workforce development and economic opportunity for residents.

Building a forum

The need to dedicate time and space for these discussions was very apparent in the aftermath of the construction of the third runway at SEA. The contentious conversations around that project highlighted the clear need for a predictable, consistent way for community and Port leaders to meet and talk about airport issues and other local concerns. In response, elected city officials and Port Commissioners began the work of creating the Highline Forum.

In January 2005, officials and administrators from the Port of Seattle, the six Highline cities, Highline College, and the Highline School District gathered for the first ever meeting, kicking off what has been 20 years of dialogue and engagement. The Highline Forum provides members with a regular and constructive venue for both aviation and non-aviation issues alike.

In recent years, the bi-monthly forum has covered a range of topics including:

third runway usage

noise mitigation programs

air quality initiatives like the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency’s monitoring program

State and federal legislative agendas of members

airport capital improvements and master planning

transportation updates from regional agencies

anti-human trafficking efforts

workforce and tourism development opportunities

The Forum has also been a central location for elected-to-elected discussions on initiatives like the South King County Community Impact Fund, the Sound Insulation Repair and Replacement Pilot Program, and coordination leading up to the 2026 Men’s FIFA World Cup. Joint efforts on addressing the need for more affordable childcare options in this area is also a part of ongoing conversations at the forum.

Additionally, members of the forum helped lead the charge on creating the SEA Stakeholder Advisory Round Table (StART) to bring community voices to the table and work on way ways to minimize airport impacts on surrounding airport communities; StART maintains a dotted-line reporting relationship to the Highline Forum.

What’s ahead this year?

This year kicked off with discussions of each member’s 2025 state and federal legislative priorities including StART’s shared legislative priorities for the 2025 state legislative session. Those policies include:

Ensuring state regulations on noise insulation programs complement the Port’s program and keep pace with federal regulations

Making tangible progress toward identifying additional regional airport capacity

Sustaining existing state programs to enhance air quality

Maintaining and expanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production and use in Washington

Pursuing decarbonization of ground transportation, reducing transportation emissions, and promoting electrification

Staff members from Washington’s congressional delegation also shared their legislative focuses for this year:

Megan Utemei of U.S. Senator Patty Murray’s office spoke about immigration issues, funding secured for a King County Metro Rapid Ride line, and support of community focused aviation legislation

Chirag Vedullapalli of U.S. Representative Adam Smith’s office talked about reintroducing the Aviation Noise and Emissions Mitigation Act and the Aviation Impacted Communities Act

Marielle Trumbauer of U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal’s office talked about their office’s support of the above Acts, in addition to their committee assignments and focus on pro-worker and pro-consumer legislation

Other important topics to be covered this year include updates and discussion on next steps for the Sound Insulation Repair and Replacement Pilot Program – especially now that the assessment phase is complete and related community outreach is underway. Future meetings will cover the Part 150 Noise Study, an update on the Sustainable Airport Master Plan Near-Term Projects environmental review, the South King County Community Impact Fund Environmental Grant program, workforce development, regional transportation agency updates, Economic Development Partnership Grant opportunities, and the StART Annual Report. As has been proven over the past two decades, there are plenty of subjects to cover that matter to Highline constituents.

Maximum range of the Grand Caravan EX is 912 nm, with maximum cruise speed of 185 ktas, the manufacturer says.
The factory-new list price of the Grand Caravan EX on its introduction in 2013 was $2.4 million.
“The Cessna Caravan is well known for its dependable and efficient performance, and highly trusted by regional airlines, cargo carriers and charter operators worldwide,” says ZeroAvia.
While direct operating costs vary by configuration, owners of a typically configured Cessna Grand Caravan EX can expect to spend around $650 per hr.","Textron Aviation this year is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the first delivery of its Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine utility turboprop, a multi-mission platform that remains popular and could see even longer life with alternative propulsion.

Textron Cessna delivered 70 Caravans in 2024 and more Caravans in the first quarter this year—23—than any other jet or turboprop in its parent company's portfolio.

Conceived as a rugged utility aircraft with low operating costs, the 10-passenger, 1,070 nm max range, Cessna 208 Caravan entered service in 1985 and has since evolved into four models, including two amphibian variants.

Early Caravans were powered by a 600-shp Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-114 engine (upgraded to 675-shp PT6A-114A engine in 1998) and fitted with Bendix/King, Garmin, or mixed avionics. Average retail value of the aircraft on its introduction was $675,000, according to the Aircraft Bluebook.

In collaboration with major launch customer FedEx, Cessna certified the 208B Super Cargomaster with 4-ft. longer fuselage in freight configuration in 1986. This was followed in 1990 by first delivery of the 208B Grand Caravan with extended fuselage (to 41 ft., 7 in. from 37 ft., 7 in.), accommodating up to 14 passengers. Its factory-new, equipped list price was $914,500.

Garmin G1000 avionics became standard on the Grand Caravan in 2008.

Grand Caravan EX

The Grand Caravan EX with 867-shp PT6A-140 engine, McCauley four-blade aluminum, constant-speed propeller and Garmin G1000 NXi avionics entered service in 2013. Deliveries of the amphibian variant began the same year. The more powerful engine delivered a 38% improvement in rate of climb over the Grand Caravan, a 350-ft. reduction in takeoff roll, and a 10-12 ktas improvement in cruise speed on average, according to Cessna.

Maximum range of the Grand Caravan EX is 912 nm, with maximum cruise speed of 185 ktas, the manufacturer says. Its useful load is 3,532 lb. Takeoff ground roll at MTOW (8,807 lb.) on a paved runway, sea level is 1,399 ft.

The factory-new list price of the Grand Caravan EX on its introduction in 2013 was $2.4 million. The 2024 list price was $2.685 million, with a higher average retail value of $2.85 million.

The Aviation Week Network Fleet Discovery database in April counted 2,304 208B Caravans in service, stored or parked worldwide.

The International Aircraft Dealers Association Aircraft Exchange in April listed four Grand Caravans for sale: a 2023 Grand Caravan EX with 54 hr. offered by Cessna for $2.995 million, two EX models from 2020-21, and a 2021 Grand Caravan. The website listed one 2021 Caravan for sale.

Upgrades And Alternatives

Waco, Texas-based Blackhawk Aerospace offers XP140 and the Vy engine upgrades for the Caravan and Grand Caravan, featuring P&WC PT6A-140 and PT6A-42A replacement engines, respectively. Each delivers performance benefits including increased climb rate, shorter takeoff distance, and higher maximum cruise speed to earlier Caravans with factory-fitted PT6A-114s.

The Caravan is also a canvas platform for multiple companies developing electric, hybrid-electric and hydrogen propulsion units.

Long Beach, California-based Ampaire has developed the Eco Caravan with AMP-H570 hybrid-electric powertrain, which runs on sustainable aviation fuel. Motor manufacturer magniX first flew its eCaravan with magni500 electric propulsion unit in May 2020. Surf Air Mobility, which has partnerships with magniX and systems integrator AeroTEC, in December 2024 received the first four of 20 Grand Caravan EXs it plans to upgrade with a proprietary electrified powertrain. ZeroAvia is developing its ZA600 hydrogen-electric powertrain for the turboprop.

“The Cessna Caravan is well known for its dependable and efficient performance, and highly trusted by regional airlines, cargo carriers and charter operators worldwide,” says ZeroAvia. “[H]ydrogen-electric propulsion is the future of truly clean flight, and…the Cessna Grand Caravan is the perfect place to start.”

During a first-quarter earnings call April 24, an analyst asked Textron President and CEO Scott Donnelly if the company has its own plans to electrify the Caravan.

“There are a number of companies out there that are electrifying Caravans,” Donnelly said. “It’s been one of the preferred choices for folks who are working in that space because it has such a huge useful load. To the extent that you have a penalty in terms of battery weight and stuff like that, a Caravan can absorb an awful lot of weight and still provide really good performance with a good payload and hundreds of miles of range.”

Textron Aviation has relationships with and is supporting companies working to certify electric versions of the Caravan, he added.

“They would own a supplemental type certification (STC) that would let you take a Caravan and modify it and put it into service as an electrified aircraft,” Donnelly said. “We have the ability to take that and incorporate that STC basically into our production line. If we see sufficient volume, sufficient demand, we would absolutely look at turning that into a production product.”

Interior And Operating Costs

The Grand Caravan EX cabin measures 54 in. high, 64 in. wide, and 21 ft., 4 in. wide. Baggage capacity is 1,410 lb. by weight and 143 ft.3 by volume.

Yingling Aviation of Wichita, Kansas, offers the Oasis executive interior for Caravans and Grand Caravans with several seating configurations for up to 11 occupants, including crew. One option consists of two forward-facing seats behind the crew, a four-place club seating area with side tables, an aft divan seating two people and a standard flushing toilet approved for occupancy during takeoff and landing.

“Passengers appreciate the Grand Caravan’s ability to reach remote destinations, making it ideal for travel to less accessible areas,” says Chris Crow, Textron Aviation vice president for piston and utility sales. “Additionally, they favor the large windows, which offer excellent views and the ease of entering and exiting the aircraft.

While direct operating costs vary by configuration, owners of a typically configured Cessna Grand Caravan EX can expect to spend around $650 per hr. for an aircraft under warranty, including fuel, labor, parts and engine/prop reserves, Crow says.

N-registered Caravans are required to comply with FAA regulations for an annual/100 hr. inspection. International operators that are allowed to follow the manufacturer’s recommended maintenance program can use the Task Based Inspection Program, which aligns most inspections to a 12 month or 200-hr. interval, minimizing downtime for unique-interval inspections, Cessna says.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-04-29 11:56:25.183712

The past year has marked a period of significant transformation, characterized by rapid federal policy shifts and persistent state-led efforts to advance zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) and near-zero-emission (NZE) technologies, such as electric and natural gas vehicles, respectively. Recent regulatory changes and federal funding adjustments, coupled with substantial economic uncertainty, have introduced a period of peak complexity for fleet operators.

Despite this, more than $13.5 billion in state and local funding remains available for ZE and NZE projects, driving continued adoption of renewable fuels, compressed natural gas vehicles (CNG), battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), as outlined in the 2025 State of Sustainable Fleets Market Brief, authored by TRC Companies.

“The rapidly evolving policy landscape and questions around how that will impact technology investments have introduced uncertainty for fleets,” says Nate Springer, VP of market development at TRC Companies. “Nevertheless, the industry’s response—marked by growing adoption of renewable fuels, innovative infrastructure solutions, and strategic partnerships—underscores strong fundamentals for continued growth of many clean fleet solutions.”

Key takeaways:

· In 2024, renewable diesel (RD) production increased by 28% in the first half of the year compared to the same period in 2023, with fleets reporting a record-high 39% adoption rate in the history of the annual fleet survey.

· Renewable natural gas (RNG) supply has surged by 234% over the past six years, supported by a 63% increase in natural gas stations offering RNG and vehicle sales hold steady.

· Meanwhile, BEV deliveries reached a record 41,472 medium- and heavy-duty (MD/HD) units, driven largely by commercial cargo vans and pickup trucks, which accounted for 92% of new registrations, despite pauses and adjusted forecasts by several manufacturers last year.

· Hydrogen fuel cell deployments also gained momentum despite two high-profile manufacturer bankruptcies, with 75 new transit buses and 165 MD/HD vehicles delivered in 2024.

Federal priorities have shifted toward conventional fuels, with Executive Orders pausing IIJA and IRA disbursements and reconsidering EPA greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations such as the Clean Trucks Rule. However, state and local programs, offering over $13.5 billion, continue to drive NZEV and ZEV adoption, with California pausing private fleet ZEV mandates but continuing to drive adoption with funding.

RD adoption grew, with 39% of surveyed fleets using the fuel, supported by a 28% production increase in the first half of 2024. Biodiesel (BD) usage remained steady at 29%, while diesel fuel costs dropped 11% to $3.21 per gallon nationally. Diesel vehicle and associated fleet efficiency gains showed mixed results over the year, though leading HD adopters can still achieve 8.5+ mpg.

The debut of 15-liter natural gas engines in late 2024 saw orders from 40 fleets, while Class 8 tractor registrations surged 50% to 2,317 units. RNG supply expanded, with over 400 operational facilities and a 63% increase in stations offering RNG. CNG prices remained below diesel by an average of $0.25 per diesel-gallon-equivalent and fleets reporting continued cost savings.

Despite a reduced forecast in orders, MD/HD BEV deliveries hit 41,472 in 2024, up significantly from 2023. Cargo vans and pickups dominated, comprising 92% of registrations. New solutions are proliferating to address the unique charging needs of fleets, such as shared charging hubs and so-called “flexible interconnect”, which allows earlier access to electricity in a project lifecycle.

The industry faces a highly uncertain future; development is likely to slow or pause.

'Industrial vandalism and devastation' Unite Scottish secretary Derek Thomson said the first wave of redundancies marked the historic end of oil refining in Scotland.","Scotland's only oil refinery has stopped processing crude oil at Grangemouth after a century of operations, its owner Petroineos has confirmed.

In September, the company announced refining activities would cease in 2025 as it transitions to becoming an import terminal for finished fuels.

The site on the south bank of the Firth of Forth is home to the UK's oldest oil refinery, dating back to 1924.

It is being closed down by Petroineos, with the loss of 430 of the 2,000 jobs based at the sprawling 1,700-acre industrial complex.

The union Unite said political leaders had ""utterly failed"" the workers and the Grangemouth community, and would face ""electoral wrath"".

The SNP has called for the refinery to be nationalised, a demand rejected by the UK government.

Petroineos has been operating as an import terminal for several months in parallel with refinery cessation activities.

Iain Hardie, regional head of legal and external affairs for the company, confirmed the end of oil refining.

He said: ""Petroineos has invested £50m in creating a modern import and distribution terminal capable of receiving finished fuels by sea for onward distribution to customers around the country.

""From today, we will be importing all the products necessary to meet Scotland's demand for transport fuels.""

About 70 refinery staff will remain to work on the new business.

Mr Hardie paid tribute to the workforce at the refinery, adding: ""Our colleagues have shown incredible commitment, dignity and resilience during months of uncertainty regarding the future of this facility, through the consultation period, phased shutdown and the start of refinery decommissioning.

""It has been a challenging period but their professionalism has ensured security of fuel supply to our customers across Scotland and beyond.""

Labour MP Brian Leishman, who represents Alloa and Grangemouth, told BBC Scotland he was ""devastated"" and ""disgusted"" by the promises broken by Scottish Labour leaders during the election campaign.

He said: "" Broken promises have consequences.

""This is not just a dark day for Grangemouth, it's a dark for the Labour Party.

""We're the party of workers. We're born out of the trade union movement. By our inaction and by inertia over the past 10 months - it's not good enough.""

Responding to the announcement in the House of Commons earlier, Mr Leishman accused governments of not doing enough to protect the refinery.

He said: ""Scotland once again is a victim of industrial vandalism and devastation, and I don't want anyone in this chamber to dare mention a 'just transition', because we all know that the Conservatives when in power and the SNP currently in Holyrood did nothing to avert this catastrophic decision happening.""

Mr Leishman also asked UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband why the current Labour government had not stepped in to save jobs at the refinery.

Mr Miliband said the government had ""put money in"" to help workers and was ""absolutely committed to building the future for Grangemouth communities"".

He added that £200m had been set aside for the refinery.

'Industrial vandalism and devastation'

Unite Scottish secretary Derek Thomson said the first wave of redundancies marked the historic end of oil refining in Scotland.

""John Swinney and Anas Sarwar will face the wrath of voters for their broken promises to the workers and the people of Grangemouth,"" he said.

""Anas Sarwar pledged hundreds of millions to save the refinery and to fund a transition to renewable industries under a Labour government.

""Instead, not one job will be saved at the refinery, not one job will be created for years by Project Willow, and not one penny of the £200m National Wealth Fund can be unlocked without private investment.""

The Scottish and UK governments funded the Project Willow report into the options for the site.

It said Grangemouth must switch to green energy to meet its vast need for power, and then use that to produce new sustainable products.

But it also said this would require around £3.5bn of private investment.

Petroineos has said the refinery is loss-making and has rejected claims from unions that the site could easily transition into a hub for producing sustainable aviation fuel.

First Minister John Swinney said the end of refining at the plant was a ""very sad day for Grangemouth, and for the country more generally"".

He added: ""We have said all along that this decision was premature, fundamentally short-sighted and detrimental to the transition to net zero.

""Our calls for the UK government to step in and try and maintain operations have gone unheeded so far.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/57a4/live/b0fd2c80-24e8-11f0-999f-c9c1fc7ac610.png,N,,2025-04-29 11:56:29.644538

Ivan began by acknowledging the global context, stating plainly that headwinds such as shifting investments and geopolitical tensions are impacting climate commitments. But he was quick to defend the momentum in APAC, arguing that while the region faces unique challenges, it also holds huge innovation potential.

“Singapore, for example, is progressing on multiple fronts – from revising its 2035 emissions targets to implementing a carbon tax and establishing international carbon market mechanisms,” he said.

Other countries like Indonesia are also increasing renewable energy targets and laying the groundwork for greener economies.

At the corporate level, Ivan shared that the number of companies setting science-based targets (SBTs) across the region is rising fast.

“Japan has more than 800 SBT-aligned firms – more than the UK or US,” he noted. But achieving net zero, especially in emerging markets, comes with a just transition imperative.

“The commercial obligations are higher because companies must also support equitable, local development,” he added.

Cost, capability and creative financing

The conversation then turned to the burden many SMEs face in meeting new decarbonisation demands. Ivan was clear: APAC cannot be expected to foot the global climate bill alone. Instead, countries and companies need to be smart and strategic, investing where regional strengths can deliver global value.

“Take data centres,” he said. “Cooling in tropical climates is a uniquely APAC challenge. Innovation in this space—like higher operating temperatures or tropical DC design—can be exported globally.”

Similarly, Singapore’s lack of land has triggered cross-border energy collaborations such as the Australia-Asia Power Link.

Ivan also flagged sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstocks as an area of untapped opportunity in the region. The message was clear: context matters. Tailored solutions can have ripple effects well beyond the region.

He gave concrete examples of financial enablers already in play.

“Singapore is funding carbon capture grants. SMEs can and should apply for these to drive innovation,” he said. Public-private collaboration, smart regulation and government incentives were all positioned as critical accelerators.

Tools for resilience and decision-making

Ivan then shared practical enablers from his own consulting work, highlighting how internal carbon pricing is becoming a valuable tool for companies facing complex growth decisions.

“When companies are expanding, how do they know if an acquisition will derail their net zero targets?” he asked. The answer: model the carbon liability.

“You can estimate future carbon taxes, offset costs, or the expense of decarbonisation pathways—then include that in your investment planning,” he added.

This approach, he explained, helps executives understand the full cost of growth in a carbon-constrained world. He also highlighted scope 3 emissions as a particularly tough challenge in APAC, with many companies needing support to map, calculate and mitigate downstream impact.

Ivan encouraged leaders to tap into government resources where possible. In one example, he described supporting a transport and logistics firm in securing funding to conduct a full decarbonisation roadmap, including scope 1, 2 and 3 assessments.

“It’s not just about internal action—it’s about finding and unlocking external support,” he said.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/f970ed91ac2cc72b8bea20d4ab1700cb:ef0be6f11ed3074739c6c6d32a510c62/maxresdefault.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-04-29 11:56:42.650098

UK's Grangemouth refinery stops processing crude

London, 29 April (Argus) — The Petroineos joint venture's 150,000 b/d Grangemouth refinery in Scotland has stopped processing crude and the company will now import transport fuels to meet demand, it said today. The move ends more than 70 years of refining at Grangemouth, and around 400 workers will lose their jobs. The closure removes 13pc of the UK's refining capacity, which will probably increase the country's reliance on imported refined products. Petroineos — a joint venture between PetroChina and UK-based Ineos — said in November 2023 it would close the refinery in spring this year, later deciding to repurpose the site to an import and distribution terminal. It said today it has invested £50mn ($67mn) in this. Petroineos rejected a call from UK labour union Unite for the refinery to be converted into a a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant. London has said it would provide £200mn for investment in clean energy at the Grangemouth site, which it hoped would unlock private sector funds. Unite today said ""for all the talk, nothing has been done"", and said the closure was because the UK and Scottish governments ""have effectively allowed China to shutdown Scotland's capacity to refine fuel"". Slow death UK refinery output dropped to a 17-month low in March, reflecting Grangemouth's gradual drop in run rates ahead of processing its final barrel. The effect on national fuel balances has already been felt, with UK gasoil imports at an almost six-year high of 1.484mn t in April, and net gasoline exports the lowest on record at 65,000t, according to the country's latest submission to the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (Jodi). The Grangemouth closure is one of three major refinery shutdowns planned this year in Europe. In Germany, Shell began to close its 147,000 b/d Wesseling refinery in March , and BP plans to remove a third of the crude distillation capacity at its 257,000 b/d Gelsenkirchen site this year . This removal of 400,000 b/d of capacity represents around 3pc of Europe's total. This year's plant closures are widely expected to exacerbate a supply squeeze of middle distillates on the continent, while failing to address a growing gasoline supply overhang exacerbated by the ramp-up of production from Nigeria's 650,000 b/d Dangote refinery. Further unplanned European refinery closures are anticipated by market participants as product margins slide from post-pandemic highs and elevated overheads squeeze operating profits.

Thailand’s PTTEP posts higher 1Q oil, gas sales

Singapore, 29 April (Argus) — Thai state-controlled upstream firm PTTEP's oil and gas sales rose in the first quarter of 2025, but revenues fell slightly on a decline in crude prices. PTTEP's sales over January-March totalled 484,000 b/d of oil equivalent (boe/d), up by 2pc from the same period a year earlier on higher production from its G1/61 project and a rise in crude oil sales from the Malaysia Block K project. But sales dropped by 3pc on the quarter, primarily because of lower crude oil and condensate sales from its overseas projects — namely Oman's Blocks 6 and 61, and Algeria's Hassi Bir Rekaiz project — and a drop in gas sales volumes because of a maintenance shutdown at its G2/61 project. The firm has signed an amendment to the gas sales agreement for its Arthit project to raise the daily contracted quantity of natural gas supplied to parent company and trading firm PTT from 280mn ft³/d to 330mn ft³/d from June onwards. This is to ""help address domestic natural gas demand and reinforce national energy security,"" said the firm. PTTEP in April acquired additional stakes in Apico, a joint venture partner in the Sinphuhorm onshore oil field in northeastern Thailand, raising its share from 80.487pc to 90pc. This has in turn led to a higher share of production volumes from the project, which produced an average of 105mn ft³/d of gas and 222 b/d of condensate in 2024. The company is also currently progressing towards taking a final investment decision (FID) on its Arthit carbon capture and storage (CCS) project. Front-end engineering design for the project has been completed and the firm is currently preparing agreements, it said. PTTEP aims to reduce 700,000-1mn t/yr of CO2 emissions through this CCS project. The firm recorded revenues of $2.185bn for January-March, down by 1pc on the year and by 9pc on the quarter. Its average selling price fell to $45.74/boe on a decline in crude prices, said the firm. This resulted in the firm's profit for the first quarter falling by about 7pc on the year and by 9pc on the quarter to $488mn.

Carney’s Liberals to form next Canadian government

Calgary, 28 April (Argus) — Canadian prime minister Mark Carney and his Liberal party are projected to win the country's 45th general election, but securing a majority of seats in Parliament is unclear with many tight races still to be determined. The Liberal party is on track to take 156 of the 343 seats up for grabs, according to preliminary results from Elections Canada at about 11pm ET. The Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, will form the official opposition with an estimated 144 seats so far. The Liberals seat count is comparable to the 160 won in the 2021 election while the Conservatives are up from 119. If the Liberals win a minority they would need the support of other parties to pass legislation, as they did prior to the election. The win completes the comeback for the Liberal party which just a few months ago languished in polls as dissatisfaction of then-prime minister Justin Trudeau rose. Carney and his experience navigating economic crises resonated with voters as they found themselves in a trade war initiated by US president Donald Trump. The US has imposed a 25pc tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum since 13 March and Canadian automobiles since 9 April. Canada has retaliated to each wave with tariffs of their own. Canadian oil and gas has been exempt from US tariffs but Trump's trade action has led many politicians and Canadians at large to re-examine the need to diversify its energy exports. Trade corridors, pipelines and LNG facilities were promoted by both Carney and Poilievre. Carney and Trump agreed in late-March that broader, comprehensive economic negotiations would happen after the election. The Liberals have held power since 2015, but only in a minority capacity since the 2019 election. Inflation, housing, Trump top concerns The key issues for Canadians this election cycle were inflation, housing, cost of living and international relations — particularly the aggressive moves from the US, according to polls. Diversifying trade and growing energy production have been promoted by both Conservative and Liberal leaders — and prime minister hopefuls — looking to become less dependent on US customers and kickstart a lagging economy. Canada is the world's fourth-largest oil producer with over 5.7mn b/d of output, and the fifth-largest natural gas producer at 18 Bcf/d, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP). The US is Canada's largest foreign customer of each, but verbal and economic attacks on Canada by Trump have prompted politicians and Canadians at large to reexamine their trade strategies. Poilievre says Liberal policies over the past decade have stifled the country's productivity and allowed it to become the weakest performer in the G7. Liberal policy needs to be undone so Canada can ""unleash"" its oil and gas sector to better protect its sovereignty , says Poilievre. Carney's campaign had centered heavily on Trump, emphasizing the threat comes from abroad, not within. Carney wants to make Canada an ""energy superpower"" but maintains current legislation is the way to do it, despite calls to the contrary by oil and gas executives .

Canadians go to polls in general election

Calgary, 28 April (Argus) — Voting in Canada is underway today with the governing Liberal party looking to complete a comeback in polling against the Conservative party to clinch its fourth-straight term. There are 343 seats up for grabs in Canada's Parliament and polls throughout the five-week campaign indicate the Liberals have a reasonable chance to win a majority, which would allow them to implement policies without needing the support of other parties. Latest polling figures show the Liberals at 43pc, the Conservatives at 39pc, the New Democratic Party (NDP) at 8pc, the Bloq Quebecois at 6pc, and the Green Party at 2pc, according to poll aggregator Canada338 on Monday. The Liberals have held power since 2015, but only in a minority capacity since the 2019 election. The key issues for Canadians this election cycle are inflation, housing, cost of living and international relations, according to polls. Diversifying trade and growing energy production have been promoted by both Conservative and Liberal leaders — and prime minister hopefuls — looking to become less dependent on US customers and kickstart a lagging economy. Canada is the world's fourth-largest oil producer with over 5.7mn b/d of output, and the fifth-largest natural gas producer at 18 Bcf/d, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP). The US is Canada's largest foreign customer of each, but verbal and economic attacks on Canada by US president Donald Trump have prompted politicians and Canadians at large to reexamine their trade strategies. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre says Liberal policies over the past decade have stifled the country's productivity and allowed it to become the weakest performer in the G7. Liberal policy needs to be undone so Canada can ""unleash"" its oil and gas sector to better protect its sovereignty , says Poilievre. Liberal leader Mark Carney's campaign has centered heavily on Trump, emphasizing the threat comes from abroad, not within. Carney wants to make Canada an ""energy superpower"" but maintains current legislation is the way to do it, despite calls to the contrary by oil and gas executives . A fresh face for the Liberals and a foe to rally against in Trump has lifted the fortunes of the party, which some critics speculated only months ago could lose most of its seats. As recent as January, the Liberals were facing a 26-point deficit in polls, but the party mounted a comeback at the expense of both the Conservatives and the left-leaning NDP. The Conservatives would likely have to overtake the Liberals by several percentage points to win enough seats to form a government, based on the past two elections in 2019 and 2021. More Canadians voted for Conservatives than any other party in those races, but the Liberals came away with the most seats, owing to their success in winning tight races. The last polls close on Canada's west coast at 10pm ET with preliminary results expected shortly after.

Abstract

The aviation sector is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and with the increasing demand for air travel these emissions are projected to continue rising in the coming years. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) could greatly help reduce these emissions and make the aviation industry more eco-friendly. SAF is a renewable, low-carbon alternative to conventional jet fuel produced from sustainable resources. A key step to bringing the fuel into regular use is studying how people view it. Understanding what the public think and feel about biofuels, including aviation fuel, is very important. This is because public opinion can shape consumer interest, demand for products, and the willingness of governments to back green energy policies and invest in clean technologies. The study systematically evaluates the public opinion, perception and awareness of SAF in the South Central United States and its utilization to decarbonize the aviation industry. This is performed through a series of multiple-choice survey questions and interviews. The study results show that while there is some recognition of the environmental impact of aviation and the potential role of biofuels in reducing this impact, there is still a need for greater public education and awareness regarding alternative fuels and their benefits for sustainable aviation. The findings of the study underscore a pivotal challenge in addressing aviation-related carbon emissions: the gap in public knowledge about potential solutions like biofuels and SAF. This gap not only reflects a lack of awareness but also hints at the possible skepticism or uncertainty among the public regarding the effectiveness and viability of these alternatives.

Heritage Aviation is a 100% employee owned fixed-base operation (FBO) and FAA-certified 145 repair station responsible for servicing the airport’s general aviation aircraft.

Heritage Aviation welcomed its first load of SAF in February, it became Avfuel’s first customer in the Northeast U.S. to provide the new sustainable alternative to jet fuel and commit to its consistent availability.

“We were honored to welcome Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak to our facility, showcasing the dedication and expertise of our employee-owners, and our commitment to sustainability and the next generation of fuel,” said Matthew Collins, chief executive officer of Heritage Aviation. “We are thrilled to partner with Avfuel and to be its first branded FBO location in the Northeast to offer SAF, bringing the next generation of fuel to Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport.”

During the visit, Mayor Mulvaney-Stanak and Longo met with Heritage Aviation’s employee-owners to learn more about SAF, the company’s commitment to providing exceptional aviation services, fostering a culture of employee ownership, and embracing sustainable business practices. As an employee-owned business, Heritage Aviation exemplifies a model of shared success and long-term investment in the region’s economic development.

Heritage Aviation’s SAF from Avfuel—produced by Diamond Green Diesel LLC, a joint venture between a Valero affiliate and an affiliate of Darling Ingredients Inc. (NYSE: DAR)—is made using the HEFA SPK process, meaning it uses lipids, like used cooking oil, to produce the fuel, and can lower lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 80% when compared to conventional jet fuel if used in its fully concentrated form. All SAF is required to be blended with jet fuel prior to delivery.

Five key event themes

The event will see a number of themes explored in depth. (Farnborough International)

Carbon Removal – The path to effective carbon removal technologies involves not only innovation but extensive collaboration among regulatory bodies, wider industries and research institutions, which will be accelerated through SSWS25’s conference agenda and other key event features.

Zero Emissions – Zero emission flight is closer to reality than you may think. Whilst SAF offers an immediate solution to cutting CO2 emissions, the industry is working hard to develop and test hydrogen, electric, solar, and hybrid solutions for zero emission flights.

Operation Efficiency – With flight schedules being back to pre-COVID figures, operational efficiency will have a key impact on the environment and the industry’s goal to reach net zero by 2050. This theme encompasses optimising airport operations, air traffic management, operational practices and ultimately, minimising the aviation industry’s environmental footprint.

Future of Flight – Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is a key element of the future of flight and fundamentally part of the decarbonisation of the aviation sector. Development of these new vehicles is accelerating rapidly with many test flights in their early stages.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels –SAF is highly regarded as one of the key strategies in helping the aviation industry achieve a reduction in emissions. Compared with conventional fossil fuels, SAF reduces CO2 emissions across its life cycle.",https://www.aerosociety.com/media/26308/ssws-header-banner-blog.jpg,N,,2025-04-29 11:57:12.398907

The plant, backed by Zhejiang Jianglan Bio-Energy, is expected to produce 300,000 tonnes of SAF annually from December 2026, initially targeting the European market.

The SAF will be produced using Topsoe’s HydroFlex process technology, which converts renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil and animal fats into drop-in fuels that meet global jet fuel specifications.

Topsoe will also supply specialised catalysts that accelerate the chemical reactions needed to remove impurities like oxygen, sulphur, and nitrogen from the feedstocks and rearrange the molecules into hydrocarbons suitable for fuel.

Elena Scaltritti, Chief Commercial Officer at Topsoe, said that scaling SAF supply would be essential to decarbonising aviation, which as a sector emitted nearly one billion tonnes of CO2 in 2023.

When fully operational, the company stated its technology is expected to avoid approximately 698,000 tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions each year.

Hu Bowei, Chairman of Zhejiang Jianglan Bio-Energy Technology, said the project would combine the company’s biomass feedstock network with Zhoushan’s oil and gas industrial cluster to create a new growth engine for green fuels.

Now, he said, there is “resistance” to the Trump administration’s holds on Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities grants.
But he said the Trump administration’s decision to require groups that had already been made partners and gotten grants to reapply to continue in the program will slow down development and create uncertainty.
He also noted that the first Trump administration had pulled a dozen senior USDA executives from agencies into the business center it created and that the Biden administration had to “piece” back together management in the various agencies.
The current Trump administration organizational changes are on a much bigger scale, he said.","Robert Bonnie, the agriculture undersecretary for farm production and conservation in the Biden administration, said Monday that he is “very concerned that USDA is being weakened” by the Trump administration’s staffing and budget cuts.

In his first public remarks on the Trump administration’s policies, Bonnie told the North American Agricultural Journalists at their spring Washington meeting that he is particularly worried about the loss of key personnel.

Bonnie said he is prohibited from having direct contact with USDA officials for two years due to the ethics agreement he signed when he took his presidentially appointed and Senate confirmed post, but that he has learned that Tim Griffiths, the national coordinator of the Natural Resource Conservation Service’s sage grouse initiative, left USDA on Friday.

An email to Griffiths’ NRCS address in Montana on Monday resulted in the following automated reply: “I am sorry, but I am no longer available.” The response directed senders to another USDA official, and ended with “Your friend in conservation. Tim.”

Bonnie noted that the sage grouse initiative Griffiths led covers more than 9 million acres and “involves a couple thousand ranches in a voluntary, all incentive-based program.”

Bonnie said it was terrible for USDA to lose “that type of leadership, creativity. Tim is one of many people lost.”

According to a biography on the Society for Range Management website, Griffths has “spent his entire career working to achieve fish and wildlife conservation through sustainable agriculture and to reduce regulatory burdens associated with the Endangered Species Act. In 2011, Tim received the Secretary of Agriculture Honor Award for his work on the agency’s major sage grouse conservation initiative.”

Bonnie also said that 75% of the federal government’s wildfire response “sits at USDA,” and that he is worried as the summer fire season approaches, the Forest Service is “going to lose senior people, the number of teams will be reduced.”

Bonnie also pointed out that the Biden administration established relationships with Ducks Unlimited and other conservation groups, and that he worried that USDA will lose those relationships.

Bonnie, who developed the Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities during the Biden administration but also worked at USDA during the Obama administration, noted that during the Obama administration farmers “ran the other way from climate policy,” but during the Biden years the government and the farmers worked together on agriculture and forestry.

Now, he said, there is “resistance” to the Trump administration’s holds on Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities grants.

The Trump administration has changed the Partnerships initiative into the Advancing Markets for Producers initiative, and Bonnie has said he hopes that the administration will follow through on the original goals.

But he said the Trump administration’s decision to require groups that had already been made partners and gotten grants to reapply to continue in the program will slow down development and create uncertainty.

Bonnie said he also worried about the impact of cutting back on USDA programs under the Inflation Reduction Act, and the loss of U.S. international leadership.

He also noted that the first Trump administration had pulled a dozen senior USDA executives from agencies into the business center it created and that the Biden administration had to “piece” back together management in the various agencies. The current Trump administration organizational changes are on a much bigger scale, he said.

On biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel, other departments are also involved, he said.

The final guidance for the 45Z tax credit for biofuels was not completed because officials in an interagency process wanted to further examine a carbon calculator, but if the Treasury Department would put in place the peer review process established by the Biden administration, “farmers would be off to the races on sustainable aviation fuel,” Bonnie said.

But Bonnie said he is worried about the loss of leadership in all the agencies that play a role in biofuels.

If the Environmental Protection Agency, the Energy Department and the Transportation Department pull back, “farmers are going to pay the price,” he said.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/12/2025/04/29063522/Bonnie-RFP-050525.jpg,N,,2025-04-29 11:57:27.509205

Earlier in April the group reduced about 510 positions globally, in a move expected to bring annual savings of around 65 million euros.","(Reuters) -Finnish biofuel maker and oil refiner Neste expects U.S. tariffs will have only a limited direct impact on its business, it said on Tuesday, but warned of continuous oversupply in renewable fuel and market volatility.

""We expect the European policymakers to safeguard a level playing field and competitiveness of European industrial companies,"" Neste Chief Executive Officer Heikki Malinen said in a statement.

Excess supply of renewable fuel, weak demand and global economic uncertainty have hit the profitability of the Finnish group, which warned in February of ongoing challenges ahead.

Neste, which has a joint venture with Marathon Petroleum in California, added that the U.S. market remained important for the company. But the removal of Blender's Tax Credit (BTC), a clean fuel tax credits programme proposed by the Biden administration, has led the company to reoptimise its Singapore shipments, Malinen said.

Regulations in the U.S. had affected shipping from Neste's refineries in Singapore temporarily, Malinen told Reuters. However, he added he had seen no material impact on shipping costs for Neste in the first quarter of 2024 amid macroeconomic uncertainty.

The company's comparable first-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 62% from a year earlier to 210 million euros ($239 million), and Malinen said the performance remained ""unsatisfactory"".

Analysts in a company-provided consensus had expected 211.7 million euros on average.

Neste's sales margin in the renewable products segment fell 41% to $310 per tonne in the quarter, but beat the average expectation of $242 per tonne.

Neste shares were up more than 12% in Helsinki at 1100GMT. J.P.Morgan analysts said in a note to clients the better than expected sales margin should offer some share price relief.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) customers are gauging the market now, Malinen said, adding that he sees SAF demand weighed toward the second half of the year.

But while the company said it still expects its sales volumes to improve in 2025, it warned of the impact from oil price movements amid geopolitical uncertainty.

Earlier in April the group reduced about 510 positions globally, in a move expected to bring annual savings of around 65 million euros.

“We are deeply committed to fostering the growth of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel industry and are thrilled to see ATOBA introduce their innovative approach to catalysing the development of the SAF market,” said Raminder Shergill, Director of Tax & Fuel Strategy at easyJet. “By addressing the long-term offtake challenges that have hindered investment in SAF projects, ATOBA’s approach paves the way for accelerated industry expansion, greater investment confidence, and credible pricing and supply security for easyJet.”

Currently, one of the biggest issues with the introduction of SAF in airline operations is the struggle to meet the increasing demand that has been accelerated due to new sustainability mandates. ATOBA uses a unique business model to counter SAF production problems, using upstream and downstream SAF offtake portfolio management.

Essentially, ATOBA avoids technological and pricing risks by offtaking from diversified producers, facilitating long-term offtake agreements with airlines, jet-fuel distributors, SAF producers, and financial institutions.

“We are proud to partner with easyJet and World Fuel, two aviation industry leaders taking bold and proactive steps to accelerate aviation’s transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuels,” commented Arnaud Namer, co-founder and CEO of ATOBA Energy. “With their expertise in highly efficient operational cost management, they are setting a strong precedent for the industry. We are excited to support their transition through our SAF aggregation services, providing airlines with long-term competitive advantages as they shift toward more sustainable fuels.”

World Fuel’s role will be to manage the logistics, blending, storage, and regulatory fulfillment for the EU and UK mandates to integrate SAF into easyJet’s supply chain with limited hinderance.

The event is being held in conjunction with the Biofuels Conference and Expo, which was successfully held 12 months’ ago.

The event will once again be held at the Hotel Le Plaza in Brussels, where the two events will take place in adjoining rooms.

For the second time, the two-day SAF Summit will be held in an adjoining conference room next to the main auditorium.

The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market is a growing sector as cutting carbon emissions from aircraft is a priority for airlines.

It is expected to grow to €50 billion by 2030 and to more than €500 billion by 2050.

Hydrogen-powered aircraft for long-haul flights are still in the developmental stage while the chances of electric aeroplanes taking to the skies any time soon will simply not happen.

The Summit, brought to you by Biofuels International, the leading global publication covering SAF, will bring together airlines, fuel producers, airports, fuel service providers, regulators and other engaged parties for this two-day event.

Other topics up for discussion during the Brussels event include decarbonisation, net-zero and energy security with biofuels taking centre stage in helping companies and governments meet their environmental goals.

The agreement is an important step toward scaling advanced SAF technologies and is intended to support the decarbonisation of easyJet.

The SAF market is facing challenges in expanding at the rate demanded by environmental needs and regulatory mandates. While producers need long-term, stable pricing contracts to ensure a return on their investments, easyJet is seeking competitive SAF market prices in the context of a nascent industry with diverse competing technologies. This conflict of expectations currently hinders the development of SAF production projects, and ATOBA's unique business model brings a compelling solution.

ATOBA uniquely facilitates the development of SAF production through its upstream and downstream SAF offtake portfolio management. By offtaking from diversified producers that use production technologies like Alcohol to Jet, Gas-Fischer Tropsch, or Power to Liquids, ATOBA mitigates technological and pricing risks associated with the various SAF production pathways and facilitates the closing of long-term offtake agreements among airlines, jet-fuel distributors, SAF producers, and financial institutions, which are essential for scaling the industry.

Fuel was delivered to Katowice International Airport in Pyrzowice; it is a considerable step when it comes to decarbonization of aviation transport in Poland. It is also a clear indication of the company’s readiness to provide comprehensive services in the new regulatory environment, which from 2025 requires the use of SAF fuel of at least 2% of the total weight of aviation fuel at airports meeting the EU airport definition.

SAF is an alternative for traditional fossil fuels; it is made from, among others, vegetable oils, animal fats and agricultural wastes. The product may contribute towards an approx. 65% reduction of needed emission so that aviation sector reaches net zero emission by 2050. In accordance with Regulation of The European Parliament and of The Council (EU) 2023/2405 from 18 October 2023, all EU airports which handle 800 thousand passengers yearly (or 100 thousand tonnes of freight) are obliged, from 1 January 2025, to use SAF in amounts not smaller than 2% of total mass of aviation fuel. Due to these criteria, eight airports in Poland are covered by this responsibility.

“Unimot Aviation has a strong logistic facility which allows us to act quickly and effectively. We want to be not only a supplier, but also a comprehensive partner for airlines and airports in Poland – supporting them in becoming accustomed to new regulations and building a more balanced future of aviation. In the context of global efforts to reduce emissions, alternative fuels such as SAF will only grow in importance” said Adam Sikorski, President of the Board of Unimot.

The delivery to Katowice Airport culminated with UNIMOT Aviation Services refueling an Airbus A320 aircraft for a flight to Marsa Alam (RMF), Egypt, which took place on 23 April 2025. It was the first time a cruise aircraft was refueled in Poland with SAF.

Thanks to Unimot Aviation, Katowice Airport became the first airport in Poland where physical delivery of sustainable aviation fuel was realized. I wish to thank for choosing our airport. It’s an important signal for the market. Construction of a multimodal goods and fuel delivery hub with railway siding connection is in progress at Katowice Airport. The investment, which will conclude in mid-2026, is co-funded by the European Union. After putting the infrastructure into service, it will be the most advanced aviation infrastructure in Poland to store and distribute aviation fuel, including SAF, said Artur Tomasik, President of the Board of the Upper Silesian Aviation Group (Górnośląskie Towarzystwo Lotnicze S.A. – GTL S.A.)

The agency maintains that increased and diverse domestic sources of jet fuel are needed for military purposes, resulting in less reliance from foreign suppliers.
We must not cede America’s leadership role on SAF, and we have a great opportunity ahead to leverage America’s energy resources and technical acumen.","OPINION:

With President Donald Trump’s focus on American energy dominance, increasing U.S. energy production and generation is a top priority of the administration that recognizes the importance of lowering energy prices for families and increasing American economic security.

U.S. airlines understand and support President Trump’s focus on American energy dominance. As one of the most significant and volatile operating costs for airlines, jet fuel is a key element in providing safe, reliable and cost-competitive air travel for more than 2.7 million Americans and transporting 61,000 tons of cargo by air every day.

A promising and growing source of U.S. energy is the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is jet fuel derived from renewable sources including waste, oils, fats and agricultural products, among other sources. Already in 2024, reflecting years of government and industry collaboration, over 100 million gallons of SAF were available in the United States, but this amount is still a small fraction the 26-billion-gallon U.S. jet fuel market. As a result, increased SAF production has the potential for significant growth, economic benefits and job creation across the U.S. economy including in the agriculture, energy, transportation and manufacturing sectors.

Achieving significantly increased U.S. SAF production and tapping America’s extensive resources for it, however, will not succeed without effective policies and incentives to catalyze the full potential.

Fortunately, members of Congress in both the House and Senate recognize the potential of SAF and have introduced legislation to support its growth. For example, Rep. Max Miller (R-Ohio), recently reintroduced the “Farm to Fly” Act in the House and Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) introduced companion legislation in the Senate. These bills would help foster the development of SAF within the confines of existing U.S. Department of Agriculture programs, enabling collaboration between America’s farmers, fuel producers and airlines while also supporting the U.S. energy dominance agenda.

In the near-term, we urge Congress to extend and improve the “45Z” Clean Fuel Production Credit. The three-year duration of the current 45Z credit limits its effectiveness in attracting private sector investment, but with a longer duration and other improvements it could lead to a dramatic increase in U.S. SAF production. Through the reconciliation process, Congress can address this gap and put in place a durable credit that will unlock the potential for SAF grown, produced and consumed in the U.S. benefiting America’s farmers and enabling Americans to fly on aviation fuel produced from America’s heartland.

Aside from Capitol Hill, SAF also has historical support from the Department of Defense. The agency maintains that increased and diverse domestic sources of jet fuel are needed for military purposes, resulting in less reliance from foreign suppliers.

As we look to the future, U.S. airlines and the broader U.S. aviation sector will continue to be global leaders in providing safe and reliable air transportation, while also curbing our emissions and environmental impact. We must not cede America’s leadership role on SAF, and we have a great opportunity ahead to leverage America’s energy resources and technical acumen.

We appreciate the administration’s priority on American energy resources and the support and leadership from members of Congress who are championing the opportunity of SAF.

Adapting to accelerate Antwerp platform decarbonization

The TotalEnergies Antwerp platform is speeding up its decarbonization with the introduction of green hydrogen.

As part of a 200 MW Air Liquide electrolyzer project, TotalEnergies has signed a tolling agreement for 130 MW dedicated to the annual production of 15,000 tonnes of green hydrogen for its Antwerp platform.

Upstream of the electrolyzer, TotalEnergies will supply green electricity to the platform thanks to its OranjeWind offshore wind project.

Scheduled for the end of 2027, the OranjeWind project will reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at the Antwerp site by up to 150,000 tonnes per annum.

Produce SAF via co-processing

With the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),

TotalEnergies Antwerp will contribute to its aviation customers’ energy transition, helping them meet the challenge of reducing their carbon footprint with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

An initial project to produce 50,000 tonnes of SAF per annum via coprocessing will be implemented at the Antwerp platform in 2025.

Co-processing is a SAF production method that enables the simultaneous treatment of hydrocarbons and biomass in a conventional refining unit.

Battery-based energy storage

Thanks to process electrification and battery-based energy storage, the Antwerp platform is contributing respectively to the decarbonization of its industrial operations and to the growing need to balance Belgian and European high-voltage transmission grids.

With a power rating of 25 MW and capacity of 75 MWh, Antwerp’s battery storage system is TotalEnergies’ biggest in Europe.

Commissioned last year, it helps offset the intermittency of renewable energies to encourage their development.

Address overcapacity in petrochemicals

Alongside these future-focused developments, the Antwerp platform is also facing considerable overcapacity in the petrochemicals market.

With a significant surplus of ethylene expected in Europe, TotalEnergies thus intends to cease operating its oldest steam cracker in Antwerp by end-2027.

The latter was historically dependent on a major contract with a third-party user of the ethylene produced, which recently decided not to renew it by the end of 2027.

As a result, the steam cracker, which is not integrated into TotalEnergies’ downstream polymer production, will no longer have any outlets for its ethylene production.

The unit shutdown will allow the site to focus on its more recent steam cracker, the ethylene production of which is entirely consumed by TotalEnergies’ industrial units in Antwerp and Feluy.

The reconfiguration will be conducted without any layoffs. The 253 employees concerned will each be offered a solution aligned with their situation: retirement or an internal transfer to another position based at the Antwerp site.

This project is subject to the legally required employee consultation and notification process, which TotalEnergies will initiate with representatives of Antwerp platform employees in late April 2025.",https://bioenergyinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/totalenergiesantwerp.jpg,N,,2025-04-28 18:56:32.785870

In a major move that could redefine the aviation industry’s sustainability efforts, United Airlines has announced a groundbreaking partnership with San Francisco-based carbon removal company Heirloom. This bold collaboration focuses on one of the planet’s most ambitious climate solutions — direct air capture (DAC) — and marks a significant step toward achieving United’s aggressive net zero emissions target by 2050.

The airline revealed plans to secure the right to purchase up to 500,000 tons of carbon dioxide removal through Heirloom’s pioneering technology. This is part of United’s $200 million Sustainable Flight Fund, a forward-looking initiative that taps into investments from corporate partners, the airline itself, and even its passengers, to explore green aviation technologies including electric planes, hydrogen power, and now direct air capture.

What is Direct Air Capture and Why Does It Matter for Aviation?

Direct air capture, or DAC, is a futuristic process designed to pull carbon dioxide — the chief culprit behind global warming — directly from ambient air. Unlike traditional carbon capture methods, which trap emissions at the source (such as industrial smokestacks), DAC works by extracting CO₂ that is already circulating in the atmosphere.

Heirloom’s version of DAC uses specially treated limestone towers that naturally absorb CO₂ when exposed to air. When the limestone is later heated, it releases the captured CO₂, allowing the material to be reused. The collected CO₂ can then either be transformed into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), concrete, or safely stored underground to prevent it from contributing to climate change.

As United Airlines Ventures head Andrew Chang put it, “Carbon capture is one of our country’s fastest-growing, energy-enabling pathways. Our focus is on finding decarbonization solutions that are also commercially viable, and Heirloom’s technology fits perfectly with that vision.”

The Climate and Economic Stakes for United Airlines

The aviation industry is responsible for around 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions, according to Our World in Data. While that might sound modest, aviation’s contribution to total planetary warming is closer to 4% when considering other pollutants and atmospheric effects. These emissions not only exacerbate weather extremes but also pose growing risks to public health and mental well-being.

United Airlines has positioned itself as a leader in sustainable aviation innovation. Its partnership with Heirloom underscores a dual commitment: achieving meaningful decarbonization while maintaining a sound business model that supports scalable, profitable green technologies.

However, critics caution that direct air capture, while promising, remains expensive and energy-intensive. The U.S. Energy Department acknowledges the substantial power requirements needed for DAC facilities to operate effectively. And skeptics, including environmental groups cited by The Guardian and Reuters, warn that fossil fuel companies may exploit DAC as a “lifeline” to continue oil and gas production, delaying the systemic shift away from carbon-intensive industries.

Despite these concerns, United maintains that partnerships like the one with Heirloom are critical pieces of the broader puzzle to achieve sustainable aviation at scale.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: A Key Application for Captured CO₂

One of the most exciting aspects of United’s DAC investment is its potential to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development. SAF, made from non-fossil carbon sources such as captured CO₂, holds enormous promise to cut aviation’s carbon footprint without requiring major changes to current aircraft technology.

By using captured carbon dioxide, airlines can create fuels that, when burned, are nearly carbon neutral because the emissions released were previously removed from the atmosphere. This circular carbon economy model could be transformative — enabling airlines to fly millions of passengers with drastically lower climate impact.

The Sustainable Flight Fund, which backs initiatives like SAF startups and now direct air capture, signals that United is not just talking about net zero — it’s actively building the portfolio of technologies necessary to get there.

Heirloom’s Vision: Turning Back the Clock on Climate Change

Heirloom CEO Shashank Samala compared the company’s technology to a “time machine,” stating: “It can turn back the clock on climate change by removing carbon dioxide that has already been emitted into our atmosphere.”

The ability to reverse existing carbon pollution, rather than simply prevent new emissions, offers a tantalizing glimpse into a future where humanity can actively heal the planet rather than just slow its destruction.

Still, scaling direct air capture remains a challenge. Heirloom’s first commercial DAC facility is a significant milestone, but global experts estimate that billions of tons of carbon will need to be removed annually by mid-century to meet international climate goals.

The Broader Industry Context: Race Toward Net Zero

United is not alone in pursuing ambitious climate strategies. Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, and Alaska Airlines have all announced various sustainability initiatives involving carbon offsets, sustainable fuels, and fleet modernization. However, United’s early and aggressive bets on frontier technologies like direct air capture position it ahead of many peers.

Moreover, the competitive pressure across the industry may encourage broader adoption of DAC, SAF, and related innovations, especially as governments begin implementing stricter carbon regulations and corporate travelers demand greener options.

Conclusion: A New Flight Path Toward a Cleaner Sky

United Airlines’ partnership with Heirloom represents much more than a simple business deal — it is a bet on the future of sustainable aviation. By embracing bold technologies like direct air capture, United is helping to redefine what’s possible in an industry long considered a stubborn contributor to climate change.

Whether DAC will prove cost-effective at massive scale remains to be seen, but the urgency for solutions is clear. As climate risks intensify and public expectations rise, airlines that innovate aggressively today will be the ones best positioned to thrive tomorrow.

For travelers, stakeholders, and the planet alike, United’s latest move offers a rare kind of optimism: that high-altitude flights and low carbon footprints might coexist after all.

The study showed that the benefits generated by the wider supply chain, employee spending, and tourism activities contributing a total of USD 21.1 billion, contributing to 5.3% to GDP and 1.4 million jobs.

In Egypt, 56,100 people are reported to be directly employed in aviation, generating USD 3.5 billion of economic output, equal to 0.9% of total GDP. 32,800 are directly employed by airlines, with a further 23,300 employed elsewhere in aviation and 1.2 million in aviation related tourism.

“Aviation is a key contributor to Egypt’s economy. Directly and through its well-developed tourism industry, aviation supports nearly 1.4 million jobs. And over 5% of Egypt’s GDP has close links to aviation. Importantly, the Egyptian government is using the aviation sector as a strategic enabler for its economic and social development. I was encouraged by the Minister of Civil Aviation’s reaffirmation of the government’s commitment to continued close collaboration with IATA in order to further expand aviation’s benefits to Egypt—guided by global standards and best practices across all areas of aviation, including safety, sustainability, cost-efficiency, skills development, and more,” said Kamil Alawadhi, IATA’s Regional Vice-President for Africa and Middle East following a meeting with Dr. Sameh Elhefny, Minister of Civil Aviation, Egypt.

To continue maximizing the benefits of aviation, IATA highlights three key priorities for Egypt including, as Egypt strategically invests in airport infrastructure (Cairo International, Borg El Arab and Sphinx International), IATA urges the government to collaborate with airline users and adhere to global best practices. Such collaboration is expected to avoid unnecessary financial burdens on airlines and passengers.

IATA is encouraged by Egypt’s collaboration with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to create the capacity to produce 120,000 tonnes of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) annually. This said to support Egypt’s Vision 2030 and align with the global goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions in aviation by 2050; and from technical operations to digital transformation and sustainable practices, a future-ready workforce will strengthen safety, efficiency, and long-term resilience.",https://www.traveltrendstoday.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/favicon.jpg,N,,2025-04-28 19:56:49.557451

""This first commercial direct air capture facility is the closest thing on Earth that we have to a time machine, because it can turn back the clock on climate change by removing carbon dioxide that has already been emitted into our atmosphere,"" Heirloom CEO Shashank Samala said in the report.

It works by using specially treated limestone, which is stacked in towers. Once exposed to air, the limestone absorbs carbon dioxide. When the limestone is heated, it releases the gas and can be reused. The pollution is collected.

The project is part of United's Sustainable Flight Fund, worth more than $200 million from investments by the company, corporate partners, and even passengers, according to the reports. Other tech being explored includes electric and hydrogen-powered planes.

For its part, the aviation industry accounts for about 2.5% of the world's carbon dioxide pollution, contributing around 4% to planet overheating to date, Our World in Data reported. Health experts are finding that the warming fumes impact more than the weather and our breathing. Studies suggest exposure can even harm our minds.

Other efforts of a similar nature, called carbon capture, pull pollution from flues at production plants, preventing them from hitting the atmosphere. A South African Nestlé facility is using tech that turns the gases into useful baking soda, for example.

But the concept isn't without hurdles. The U.S. Energy Department said that DAC setups are expensive and require a lot of power to suck CO2 out of ambient air and pump it underground. A report from The Guardian last year included experts who said that government investment in the project is a ""colossal waste."" The reports echoed an earlier Reuters story with critics who think the fossil industry is using DAC as a ""lifeline for future fossil fuel use.""

At United, officials see it as a viable way to help the planet while maintaining a sound business.

""Carbon capture is one of our country's fastest-growing, energy-enabling pathways,"" United Airlines Ventures head Andrew Chang said in the news release.

European flights generated 187.6 million tonnes of CO2 last year, with traffic hitting 96% of 2019 levels - and emissions reaching 98%.

During the pandemic, aviation emissions fell by one-third, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Ten airlines were responsible for 40% of all European aviation emissions in 2024, according to the T&E report, which uses data from the EU.

Ryanair topped the list, emitting 16 million tonnes of CO2, followed by Lufthansa with 10 million tonnes, and British Airways with 9 million.

The route that emitted the most in 2024 was London to New York, which was responsible for 1.4 million tonnes of CO2, T&E said.

Responding to the report, British Airways told Skift that its emission levels were actually lower in 2024 than in 2019.

“This is partly because our carbon intensity has reduced by almost 14% since 2019, a reduction that’s been driven by our BA Better World Sustainability Strategy. We are working hard towards our target of net zero by 2050, or sooner, and this plan includes a combination of aircraft and operational efficiencies, as well as investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), new low-carbon aircraft technology and high-quality, verified carbon removals,” a spokesperson said.

The T&E report stated however, that BA’s emissions rose by 3% in 2024 when compared to 2023.

This could be because the airline grew in 2024 with more flights, passengers, and seats.

Aviation analytics such as those from Official Aviation Guide (OAG) show the airline increased its capacity by over 4%.

Lufthansa and Ryanair did not respond to requests for comment.

Putting a Price on Aviation Carbon Emissions

The T&E study also raised concerns about putting a price on aviation emissions, often called carbon pricing.

The EU has an emissions trading system (ETS), which requires airlines operating in Europe to report and monitor their emissions. Airlines must stay within an emissions cap or pay for any excess.

However, T&E said intercontinental routes are not currently priced under the EU’s system.

“As a result, no airline had to pay for their emissions on the most polluting routes departing from Europe,” the report said.

An EU spokesperson told Skift that the ETS was originally designed to include all flights arriving in and departing from the region.

But the scope was narrowed to flights within Europe to support a global carbon market for aviation, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which is scheduled to become fully operational in 2027.

Airlines Signal Trouble Ahead for 2050 Net Zero Pledges

The data from T&E comes as airline CEOs step up pressure on Brussels to go easier on environmental rules.

European airlines collectively pledged to reach net zero by 2050 through a mix of new technologies, such as alternative fuels like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), carbon trading schemes, and more efficient aircraft, engines and air traffic management.

The chief executives of four of the region’s largest airlines, including Ryanair and Lufthansa, have said the EU may need to delay SAF mandates due to a lack of supply.

Willie Walsh, the director of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently warned that some of the decarbonization strategies could prove too costly and might risk delaying the industry’s goal of reaching net zero by 2050.

“We’re going to have to reevaluate the commitment to net zero in 2050 because we’re just not getting the support that airlines require,” he told Reuters.

Liverpool remains the first Premier League club to achieve ISO20121 certification for sustainability management and maintains additional certifications for health, safety and energy management.

The club's groundskeeping team has furthered biodiversity efforts by planting more than 1,000 trees and hedges while installing honeybee colonies that now total 60,000 bees across all sites.

Even the legendary Anfield pitch is now fully recyclable, with materials repurposed for benches at the club's new orchard.

The club’s community engagement

Under its people pillar, the club expanded its equality and inclusion initiatives, hosting its first ever iftar event at Anfield where more than 2,800 people broke fast together during Ramadan.

The club's official charity, LFC Foundation, supported more than 127,000 people last season with 60% of participants coming from the most-deprived areas of the country.

The Foundation delivered a social return of US$16.78 for every US$1.22 spent on community programmes.

""The Red Way is more than a strategy – it's a key priority for the club and is embedded into every aspect of the business,"" says Rishi Jain, the club’s Director of Impact.

Liverpool’s global leadership

Liverpool has established itself as a thought leader in sustainability, participating in 24 international events throughout the 2023-24 season.

These engagements included representation at COP28 and the UN's Global Eradicate Hate Summit.

The club has committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2040 as part of its long-term environmental strategy.

""We have set ambitious targets, including achieving net zero by 2040, and we understand that we are on a journey and there is still much more to do,"" Jonathan explains.

The product will be priced at €3.90 for a single serving or €5.90 as part of a combined package with Vöslauer mineral water. Passengers traveling on Austrian short and medium-haul flights will have the opportunity to purchase SAFt as part of the airline’s commitment to offering more sustainable choices in its onboard offerings.

SAF itself is produced from biogenic residues, such as used cooking oils, and serves as a crucial technology in making flying more sustainable. Currently, SAF is used in conjunction with conventional aviation fuel in a blended form. While individual flights do not yet run solely on SAF, its inclusion in regular flight operations is a pivotal step toward more sustainable aviation. As the industry continues to expand its use of SAF, Austrian Airlines is positioning itself as a leader in promoting cleaner, greener travel.

Renewable fuels, a type of biofuel, are derived from naturally replenishing, nonedible biomass that provide a sustainable alternative to petroleum fuels and also to biofuels produced from edible crops such as corn and sugarcane.

Government policies and international regulations are driving biofuel adoption across multiple sectors, but policy support remains uneven globally. Many countries have implemented mandates for blending biofuels with gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel to curb emissions. Even in shipping, the International Maritime Organization is promoting biofuel use. However, policy approaches vary widely around the world. While the EU enforces strict mandates such as the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative requiring a minimum of 2% sustainable aviation fuel blending by 2025, some of the other regions lack such clear policies, leading to disparities in biofuel adoption and investment. The commitment of a nation to achieving interim net-zero objectives, availability of biomass, and affordability of petroleum fuels are critical factors influencing policy support for biofuels.

Despite their clean energy profile, biofuels face significant challenges, primarily related to production costs and competition with petroleum fuels. Processing advanced biomass sources such as agricultural and forestry waste remains expensive, limiting large-scale commercial viability. However, refiners such as Neste, Valero, and Marathon Petroleum are making strategic investments to scale biofuel production from these sources and thus lower costs. Feedstock diversification and technological innovations in refining are also critical to improving biofuel affordability and availability. Hence, although biofuels contribute towards energy security while reducing emissions, their adoption remains relatively nascent and restricted to certain markets globally. As a result, companies are cautious while pledging investments for new facilities, and even halting project development due to market uncertainties, as was seen in the case of Shell’s upcoming facility in Rotterdam.

Global renewable refinery capacity is experiencing significant growth, with 15 new facilities under construction in 2025 and two, Rayong in Thailand and Bratislava in Slovakia, already operational this year. By 2030, an additional 218 facilities are expected to come online, expanding the global capacity from 9,340 million gallons a year in 2024 to a projected 32,618 million gallons a year. The US currently accounts for a 51% share in global renewable fuel production, driven by policy support and incentives such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard. However, the recent political shifts in the country – including President Trump’s efforts to repeal certain provisions of the IRA, have introduced uncertainty in the policy environment.",https://www.offshore-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/04/Biofuel-CW-feat-img-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-28 12:56:16.856164

Globally, around 350 million tonnes of aviation fuel were burned in 2023.
This blend can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to conventional aviation fuels.","German energy company Mabanaft has started supplying jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to airlines at Frankfurt Airport. This move marks an expansion of Mabanaft’s aviation business into the German market. However, the volumes involved are currently quite small. Since January 2025, Mabanaft has partnered with Skytanking, an aviation fueling services company.

Together, they support operations at Frankfurt Airport. The company has already signed supply agreements with Singapore Airlines and the Lufthansa Group. This expansion adds Frankfurt to Mabanaft’s existing aviation fuel network, which includes locations in the UK and Norway. Under the European SAF Mandate, Mabanaft plans to deliver over 1,000 tonnes of SAF at Frankfurt this year.

Globally, around 350 million tonnes of aviation fuel were burned in 2023. SAF supplied by Mabanaft consists of a blend of hydroprocessed vegetable oils, fats, and greases. This blend can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to conventional aviation fuels.

Simon Weiss, Head of Aviation at Mabanaft, stated that the expansion supports the company’s strategy to strengthen aviation supply chains. Mabanaft aims to develop its presence in hard-to-electrify sectors, including aviation. They are focused on providing conventional fuels and lower-carbon alternatives.

Under the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, fuel suppliers must provide increasing volumes of SAF to airports from 2025 onward. The policy includes specific targets for synthetic fuels like e-kerosene, which is still in early commercialization stages. A report by the NGO Transport & Environment notes there are 25 industrial projects aiming to produce 1.7 million tonnes of e-kerosene by 2030.

This target exceeds the 600,000-tonne target set by EU regulation. However, no major project has yet reached a final investment decision.

JetZeros’ all-wing Z4 reduces drag and produces lift across the entire wingspan of the aircraft. Due to the fabulous design of the aircraft, it could lead to a 50% reduction in fuel burn per passenger-mile when compared to other aircraft of its size. The Z4 is designed to accommodate 250 passengers and fly on conventional jet fuel. Andrew Chang, Head of United Airlines Ventures (UAV), said:

If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network.

He continues:

United Airlines Ventures® was created to support our efforts to find innovative companies that can enhance the customer travel experience and help the airline lower its carbon footprint, and we believe JetZero reflects that philosophy.

The aircraft is expected to fly at a higher altitude using less fuel. The design of the Z4 will greatly improve efficiency during operation. A flight from New York/Newark to Palma de Mallorca, Spain, would use 45% less fuel compared to the twin aisle aircraft currently operating the route. Tom O’Leary, CEO and co-founder of JetZero, said:

United’s investment in our company signals the industry’s belief that new, innovative technology is needed in order to achieve the efficiency and cost savings that will be required to meet the continued growth in demand for air travel across the globe. JetZero is focused on one key technology – the airframe – that enables us to address all the barriers to growth. This program is the only one in development today that promises efficiency and an elevated customer experience.

Offerings

The aircraft will offer passengers flexible seating options, larger sets across all classes, and dedicated bin space for each seating. It has a wider main boarding door compared to aircraft of its size, leading to multiple aisles and passenger cabin bays. This is a futuristic aircraft that will improve aviation efficiency and greatly improve the passenger experience.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Z4-jetliner-coastline-1024x591.png,N,,2025-04-28 11:57:23.146075

“This expanded terminal demonstrates our strong commitment to California’s clean energy future, which was made possible through the leadership and collaboration with Congressman Harder, our labor partners, and the Port of Stockton.

BWC executives, customers, and partners attended the ribbon-cutting event in addition to special guest Josh Harder, a California congressman.

The state-of-the-art terminal includes the first newly constructed Marine Oil Terminal Engineering and Maintenance Standards (MOTEMS)-compliant dock built in California in nearly 30 years. It will play a vital role in advancing the renewable fuels supply chain across the state, BWC reported. It is designed to safely and efficiently transfer renewable diesel and biodiesel from marine vessels, supporting California’s efforts to decarbonize hard-to-electrify sectors such as heavy-duty transportation. The facility features modern safety and environmental systems, including spill containment, fire protection, seismic resilience, and upgraded vessel mooring infrastructure.

“At BWC, we are proud to serve as a critical link in the renewable fuels supply chain,” Adam Smith, BWC president and CEO, said in a news release. “This expanded terminal demonstrates our strong commitment to California’s clean energy future, which was made possible through the leadership and collaboration with Congressman Harder, our labor partners, and the Port of Stockton.

“We are honored to invest in this community and its future.”

BWC has rapidly expanded its Stockton terminal by over 500% in the past five years to meet California’s growing demand for renewable fuel storage and logistics, the company added. Constructed under a project labor agreement with the San Joaquin Building Trades Council, the expansion project created 30 high-quality construction jobs across nine trades.

It reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by around 70% on average over the lifecycle of its production and use when replacing fossil kerosene. It is also an enabler of growth, and can provide good, skilled jobs across the UK.

That is why this government has taken rapid action to support SAF. Just weeks into office, we reiterated our commitment to the SAF Mandate. In November (2024), we signed it into law, and it has been in place since January (2025).

The SAF Mandate is the UK’s key policy mechanism to secure demand for SAF. It delivers GHG emission savings by encouraging the use of SAF within the aviation industry. It does this by setting a legal obligation on fuel suppliers in the UK to supply an increasing proportion of SAF over time. Suppliers receive certificates for the SAF they supply. Certificates are issued in proportion to the level of GHG emission reductions that the fuel delivers. That is, the greater the savings, the greater number of certificates they receive. The SAF Mandate started at 2% of total UK jet fuel demand in 2025 and increases linearly to 10% in 2030 and then to 22% in 2040. It could deliver up to 6.3 million tonnes of carbon savings per year by 2040.

We are also committed to developing the UK SAF industry to secure a UK supply of SAF, attract investment and create good green jobs across the UK.

In January, we announced an additional £63 million of funding for the Advanced Fuels Fund, our grant funding programme for UK SAF production, extending the programme for another year.

We are also introducing a revenue certainty mechanism to help attract investment into UK SAF production. Under the SAF revenue certainty mechanism, SAF producers will enter into a private law contract with a government-backed counterparty. These contracts will set a strike price for SAF: if producers sell their SAF for below the strike price, the counterparty makes payments of the difference; if the SAF is sold for above the strike price, the producer makes payments of the difference to the counterparty. This addresses the most significant constraint on investment in SAF production and sends a clear signal to investors: that this is a serious UK investment opportunity.

This follows a ruling in summary proceedings by the District Court of The Hague.

The judge ruled that the municipality was within its rights to implement the advertising ban.
Finally, the court determined that the advertising ban does not breach European law.","The ban on fossil fuel-related advertising in the municipality of The Hague in The Netherlands will remain in force. This follows a ruling in summary proceedings by the District Court of The Hague. The travel industry had argued that the ban violated the Dutch Constitution and European legislation, but the judge ruled otherwise, rejecting the industry’s claims.

In September 2024, the city council of The Hague voted to introduce a ban on public space advertisements promoting fossil fuels, airline holidays, flight tickets, grey energy contracts, gas contracts, cruise holidays, and cars powered by fossil fuels or hybrid engines. The aim of the ban is to protect public health, reduce the negative impacts of climate change, and improve the environment. The ban came into effect on January 1, 2025, and enforcement is scheduled to begin after May 1, 2025.

The industry association ANVR and travel companies such as TUI, D-Reizen, and Prijsvrij.nl argued that the ban infringes upon the right to freedom of expression and breaches European regulations. They sought to have the ban suspended through court proceedings.

The court emphasized that municipalities have considerable discretion in adopting policies they deem beneficial for their citizens. These decisions are made democratically after debate within the city council, and civil courts must be cautious when intervening. Judicial intervention is only warranted when it is clear that the municipality has made an evidently wrongful or unlawful decision. In this case, the court found no such evidence.

The judge ruled that the municipality was within its rights to implement the advertising ban. The city sufficiently demonstrated that the measure would contribute to safeguarding the health of residents and visitors and help mitigate the adverse effects of climate change.

Furthermore, the court concluded that the ban does not violate the constitutional right to freedom of expression. Commercial advertising is not protected under freedom of expression in the same way as other forms of speech. The advertisements from the travel companies were deemed to be commercial in nature, intended to sell travel products for profit.

Finally, the court determined that the advertising ban does not breach European law. The same rules apply to both national and international businesses operating in The Hague, meaning there is no unlawful discrimination. Additionally, the judge pointed out that the travel industry remains free to advertise non-fossil-related travel options or promote their brand name and logo in public spaces. Advertising through other channels like radio, television, and the internet also remains unaffected.

As a result, the claims by the ANVR and the travel companies were dismissed.

Here are the current choices at each Milestone Moments threshold: Which Milestone Moments Should You Choose?
Final Thoughts Alaska Airlines added Milestone Rewards to its Mileage Plan program in 2025.","In 2025, Alaska Airlines got into the game of rewarding travelers with perks along their elite status journey. Rather than waiting until you reach the next tier to gain benefits, you can receive additional perks in between.

Dubbed “Milestone Moments,” these awards are available starting at 10,000 elite-qualifying miles (EQMs). That’s a relatively achievable threshold, and travelers don’t need to qualify for any levels of elite status before they can get extra benefits.

The best part about Milestone Moments is their customization, letting you choose the perk you like — or 2 perks you like, depending on which milestone you’ve reached.

Here’s everything you need to know about this new benefit for Mileage Plan flyers and the options you can choose from this year.

What Are Milestone Moments?

Alaska Airlines announced Milestone Moments along with its other loyalty program changes for 2025. Milestone Moments are perks that you can choose, starting at 10,000 elite-qualifying miles (EQMs for short) and available at 7 different thresholds as you earn more EQMs throughout the year.

Choosing Milestone Moments in your Mileage Plan account is free after you’ve qualified for them. However, you need to make your selection within 120 days.

Hot Tip:

Different perks have different expiration periods. However, if you choose to get elite status for a day, you would have up to a year to use the perk. According to a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines, it would be valid for 14 days from activation.

How To Earn Alaska Airlines EQMs

Qualifying for Milestone Moments requires earning elite-qualifying miles. Luckily, you can earn EQMs from more than just flying. Ways to collect EQMs include spending on a credit card, travel, shopping, and more.

These are the same EQMs that count toward earning Alaska Airlines’ elite status tiers, though you don’t need to reach any level of elite status to qualify for Milestone Moments. That’s because you need just 10,000 EQMs in a year to make your first milestone choice, though you need 20,000 EQMs to reach the lowest level of elite status: MVP.

Here are some of the ways to earn EQMs with Alaska Airlines:

Since Mileage Plan awards EQMs on flights according to flight distance, fare type, and where you purchased the ticket, you can check your earnings against this chart here.

Alaska Mileage Plan Milestone Moment Choices

You have options at each milestone. Some milestones provide just 1 choice, while others provide 2. Once you make a selection, your choice is final, so ensure you’re happy with it before confirming it.

Options include bonus miles, complimentary passes for inflight Wi-Fi, gifting elite status to others, and additional perks you may like. Here are the current choices at each Milestone Moments threshold:

Which Milestone Moments Should You Choose?

The value you assign to a Milestone Moment option is subjective, but it’s worth comparing them to see what you’re getting or giving up by not choosing a different item.

For reference, we value Alaska Airlines miles at 1.6 cents each. That makes 750 bonus miles worth $12, while 15,000 miles are worth $240. The same math applies to a discount on Mileage Plan Unlocked, for which you can redeem miles toward experiences and events. Getting a discount of 10,000 or 25,000 miles on these redemptions is worth $160 or $400, respectively.

Inflight Wi-Fi costs $8 on most of Alaska’s flights, while onboard meals cost between $8 and $12.50 if you don’t get a complimentary meal. A single-day visit to an Alaska Lounge costs $65.

Then there are choices that are harder to value. What’s the value you assign to moving into first class on a flight? Is it the cost difference of the ticket against the economy-class pricing, the cost of the food and drinks you consume, or some other number in between? The dollar value attached to upgrade awards may vary from person to person and flight to flight.

That same logic will apply to gifting or sampling elite status for a single trip. For an idea of the value differences, check out our comparison of MVP Gold 75K and MVP Gold 100K.

Then there are the milestones you probably shouldn’t choose. You can get rental car upgrades rather easily by holding the right credit card and matching your status across various programs. And you should consider the lounge membership discount carefully before choosing this option. It’s just a $100 discount on a membership that covers 9 lounges for a cost of $595 — so $495 with the discount.

If you’re flying long-distance with Alaska Airlines in first class (paid or booked with miles), with Alaska Airlines’ partners, or on military travel, you can access these lounges before departing without paying. You can also access the lounge if you have elite status with a Oneworld airline and are traveling beyond the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. However, that restriction doesn’t apply to those whose elite status comes from airlines other than Alaska and American Airlines, so British Airways Club members, for example, can access the lounges for free when flying in a premium cabin with a Oneworld airline regardless of destination.

As you consider the value of your options, consider both the tangible and intangible to see what value you’ll get from a benefit. Make sure to choose a perk that you’ll use and that you’ll be happy with. Remember that all choices are final.

Hot Tip:

There are other airport lounges you can visit. Memberships like Priority Pass can give you lounge access regardless of what airline you’re flying with that day. Check out our list of the best credit cards for gaining airport lounge access.

Final Thoughts

Alaska Airlines added Milestone Rewards to its Mileage Plan program in 2025. Similar to what we’ve seen with other airline and hotel loyalty programs, guests can earn choice benefits after certain thresholds are met during the year. Some options are clearly better than others, and it’s important that you clearly understand the perk and its value before making a selection, given that all choices are final.",https://upgradedpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Alaska-Airlines-planes-at-Santa-Rosa-STS-airport.jpg,N,,2025-04-28 09:56:34.494877

The U.S. ethanol industry faces mounting uncertainty as it tries to pivot into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. Alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuel, made from ethanol, holds promise but several hurdles block rapid progress.

U.S. ethanol output reached 16.2 billion gallons in 2024, almost all from corn. Yet, rising electric vehicle use and falling gasoline demand threaten traditional ethanol markets. Export opportunities are also projected to shrink in 2025, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights.

The lack of an approved Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) pathway for converting corn ethanol to jet fuel is a major obstacle. Although a petition is pending, the Environmental Protection Agency’s review process is detailed and slow.

Biofuels must cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% compared to a 2005 baseline to qualify for D4 RINs. Otherwise, they may only earn less-valuable D6 RINs.

LanzaJet is currently the only U.S. ATJ producer, using sugarcane ethanol imported from Brazil at its Georgia facility. “Soils have been a passion of mine, and I love to share it with others,” said Brandon Hall. However, LanzaJet’s model is facility-specific and cannot yet be adopted by other ethanol producers.

The 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit further complicates matters. Ethanol intended for SAF production earns less value compared to ethanol blended into gasoline, making pricing less competitive against petroleum-based jet fuel.

SAF production in early 2025 has been slow, with less than 30 million gallons produced. The Farmers First Fuel Incentive Act, if passed, would limit 45Z benefits to US-grown feedstocks, helping U.S. corn producers but challenging companies relying on imports.

Ethanol producers are ready to supply billions of gallons for SAF, aligning with national energy goals, but faster EPA approvals and stronger policies are essential for real progress.",,N,,2025-04-28 09:56:39.199942

Business travel has a huge environmental footprint, as anyone calculating their carbon footprint knows. But travelling to meet in person and attend trade shows can be seen as a non-negotiable part of doing business today. Although online meeting alternatives accelerated their evolution during COVID, many of us are back to our pre-2020 air miles.

It can be hard to see how to reduce what’s viewed as a vital part of doing business. And a reticence to face up to the carbon cost of travel can prevent companies even starting to look at their carbon footprints.

Will innovations in aviation save business travel, or must we all stop flying now?

The sustainable future of aviation

Christopher Surgenor, a key figure in the aviation industry’s move towards sustainability, will join us at greenloop. As the Programme Director for Aviation Carbon Events and the Editor and Publisher of GreenAir News, he is at the forefront of discussions and solutions aimed at reducing the sector’s carbon footprint. His expertise spans critical areas such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), carbon markets, and the overarching goal of decarbonizing the aviation industry.

Surgenor plays a leading role in convening global experts through events like the annual Aviation Carbon conference. This conference, scheduled for November 24-26, 2025, in London Heathrow, serves as a crucial platform for stakeholders to address the industry’s climate challenges, discuss pathways to meet emissions targets, and foster a transition towards a more sustainable future.

Around 2.4% of global CO2 emissions come from aviation. Together with other gases and the water vapour trails produced by aircraft, the industry is responsible for around 5% of global warming. But, only 4% of the world’s population have flown internationally, and only 1% of people are frequent flyers.

However, the aviation industry has set ambitious targets for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, and there is significant innovation around sustainable fuels, electric aircraft and flight operations.

The demand for SAF is expected to witness exponential growth over the next decade. Key factors driving this growth include stricter emission regulations, government incentives, and a rapidly evolving technological landscape in the fuel production sector. The adoption of SAF is anticipated to become a key pillar of sustainability strategies for major airlines, helping them mitigate their environmental impact while remaining competitive.

Airlines and aircraft manufacturers are increasingly incorporating SAF into their operations. Global airlines, including industry giants such as United Airlines, Delta, and Lufthansa, have already begun integrating SAF into their flight operations.

The growing investment in SAF production facilities, along with the expansion of refineries to process renewable feedstocks, has further catalyzed the market. Large-scale projects are already underway, with governments around the world offering financial support and incentives for SAF producers. This has spurred innovation in SAF production technologies, including new processes like alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) and biomass-to-liquid (BTL), which are helping to reduce production costs and improve efficiency.

Sustainable aviation fuel is primarily produced using two key technologies: Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK) and Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (HEFA-SPK). These innovative technologies are revolutionizing the production of cleaner, more sustainable fuel options for aviation.

FT-SPK technology has emerged as a frontrunner in the SAF production space, allowing for the conversion of natural gas and other feedstocks into jet fuel that meets the high-performance standards of the aviation industry. This process enables the production of SAF with significantly lower carbon emissions compared to conventional jet fuels. Similarly, HEFA-SPK technology, which converts biomass and waste oils into SAF, is gaining momentum as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. As these technologies continue to improve, they will make SAF production more efficient and cost-effective.

Another promising area is the development of power-to-liquid (PtL) fuel, which uses renewable electricity to convert carbon dioxide into liquid fuel. This innovation holds tremendous potential for reducing the carbon footprint of aviation and contributing to the sector's long-term sustainability goals. Gas-to-liquid (GTL) fuel is also emerging as a viable solution for SAF production, with several projects underway to scale this technology and meet global demand.

One of the key advantages of sustainable aviation fuel is its ability to significantly reduce carbon emissions, making it a critical solution for combating climate change. SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuels, contributing to the aviation sector's commitment to achieving carbon neutrality.

Economically, the widespread adoption of SAF is expected to provide substantial benefits, including the creation of new jobs in the clean energy and aviation sectors, as well as a reduction in the volatility of fuel prices due to the diversification of fuel sources. As the SAF market continues to expand, it will create a more sustainable, resilient aviation industry that benefits both the environment and the economy.

𝐆𝐥𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬

The demand for SAF is anticipated to grow across all regions, with the largest markets expected to be North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. North America, with its strong aviation sector and supportive government policies, is expected to be a major driver of SAF adoption. Europe, on the other hand, has already made significant strides in SAF development, and the European Union's “Fit for 55” climate package, which sets ambitious targets for emission reductions, is expected to further stimulate demand.

In Asia-Pacific, countries like Japan and Singapore are rapidly emerging as key players in the SAF market. The region is home to some of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets, which presents significant opportunities for SAF adoption in both commercial and cargo sectors. The Middle East, with its strong aviation and oil industries, is also expected to play a key role in the growth of the SAF market.

The outlook for producing jet fuel from U.S. corn ethanol, known as alcohol-to-jet (ATJ), is increasingly uncertain. The biofuels sector faces challenges as on-road ethanol demand drops with more electric vehicles and declining gasoline use. In 2024, U.S. ethanol production hit a record 16.2 billion gallons, mostly from corn.

Finding new markets is difficult. Analysts from S&P Global Commodity Insights expect ethanol exports to decline in 2025. A major barrier is the lack of Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) pathways for making jet fuel from corn ethanol.

Currently, most Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) generates about 1.6 biomass-based diesel (D4) RINs per gallon, adding $1.68 in value based on April 2025 prices. However, corn ethanol lacks an approved RFS pathway.

EPA approvals are pending but complex, especially since corn-based ATJ must show a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases compared to 2005 petroleum baselines.

LanzaJet remains the only U.S. commercial ATJ facility operator, making SAF from Brazilian sugarcane ethanol. The company's approval is specific to its Georgia plant. “Soils have been a passion of mine, and I love to share it with others,” said Brandon Hall.

The math behind the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit is another hurdle. Corn ethanol used for SAF misses out on valuable RINs and creates pricing challenges compared to petroleum jet fuel.

Early 2025 data show slow SAF production, under 30 million gallons in the first quarter. The Farmers First Fuel Incentive Act could help, by supporting US-grown feedstocks for 45Z credits.

While U.S. ethanol producers are eager to pivot to SAF and support national energy goals, clear pathways and supportive policies are urgently needed.

Currently in manufacture are the Falcon 2000LXS, the Falcon 900LX, the Falcon 6X, the Falcon 8X, and the new Falcon 10X, expected in 2027.","Dassault Aviation is a French aerospace company that has used its expertise to manufacture military and business jets over the last century. It is a company rich in heritage and tradition, known for the Falcon family. They used their cutting-edge technology and expertise in high-performance military aircraft to produce one of the first ever business jets.

Dassault is over 100 years old, and it's over 60 years since the first Falcon flight. Since then, 2700 models and 27 variants have been made. Of these, 2100 Falcons remain in service in 90 countries, including some of the original Falcon 20's, the very first business jets, according to Dassault's own publication, Above & Beyond. Especially well known, is the pioneering Falcon 900 business jet, that is still in demand today.

Founding Vision And Early Years

The Falcon business jet was the vision of Marcel Dassault, who wanted to build an aircraft that was technologically superior but with an elegant design. The Falcon story began with the Mystère 20, a twin-engine aircraft that was intended to be a military training jet but showed potential as a business jet. Aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh was impressed by the Mystère 20 and Pan American ordered 40 of the aircraft with an option for 120 more.

The aircraft was rebranded for the United States market as the Dassault Falcon 20. It became an immediate success and was seen as a workhorse aircraft with great versatility and performance. It was a design that was sleek and it had General Electric CF700 engines. Deliveries started in 1965 and it was Dassault's first entry into business aviation.

The Dassault Falcon 10 was then introduced in 1970. It was a smaller and lighter aircraft with Garrett TFE731 turbofan engines that produced 3,230 pounds of thrust. It was fast and efficient and had an excellent climb performance of around 4,600 feet per minute. Production ran from 1973 to 1989, with a total of 226 aircraft built.

Breakthrough Projects And Growth

The Falcon 50 was introduced in 1976. The first Falcon of a trijet configuration. It had greater range than the previous aircraft and a supercritical wing that enhanced performance. The advanced airfoil reduced drag at high speed. It was promoted as an aircraft that could be used across continents and across ocean flights. The Falcon 50 was pivotal in Dassault's success as a business jet manufacturer.

There was still demand for longer-range aircraft, so Dassault introduced the Falcon 900 in 1984. This was another trijet that had a wider and longer fuselage. It was a clean sheet design and built with composite materials and used advanced digital design. The Falcon 900 was pioneering in the development process as it used CAD (computer-aided design). This allowed for greater precision, efficiency, and the best optimization of the aircraft's structure and aerodynamics.

The Falcon 900 was the flagship aircraft for Dassault and the airframe design incorporates composite materials.. Later variants included the transatlantic Falcon 900LR, the Falcon 900B, the Falcon 900EX, and the Falcon 900LX. The variants all had extended range and more advanced avionics. Still in production today, the aircraft is evidently popular with private owners, governments and businesses alike.

Continued Innovation

The Falcon 2000 flew in 1993. It was a twin-engine version of the Falcon 900 but with a shorter fuselage and a shorter range. It was the first executive aircraft to be designed entirely on a computer and focused on efficiency and comfort. Dassault's skill of combining digital design and modern engineering created an optimized and efficient airframe. Variants include the Falcon 2000EX, the Falcon 2000DX, and the currently produced Falcon 2000LXS. The Falcon 2000EX was the first aircraft to have the EASy avionics suite including synthetic vision and was the first Dassault twinjet to take steep approach trials at London City Airport.

Onwards into the 2000s, the Falcon 7X trijet was introduced in 2001 and entered service in 2007. It represented a new era in business jets, with fully digital fly-by-wire controls taken from Dassault's Rafale fighter jet program. It is a long-range aircraft with a range of 5,950 nautical miles with a spacious cabin. The aircraft is powered by Pratt and Whitney Canada PW307A engines. It has a new high-speed wing and a longer fuselage than the Falcon 900 and was the first Falcon aircraft to have winglets.

The Falcon 8X is based on the Falcon 7X but has more range and was introduced in 2016. It is an ultra-long-range aircraft with a range of 6,450 nautical miles (11,945 km) at Mach 0.80 with 8 passengers and 3 crew. However, it can reach a maximum operating speed of Mach 0.90 (approximately 690 mph or 1,111 km/h). The Falcon 8X is powered by three Pratt & Whitney Canada PW307D turbofan engines, each providing 6,722 pounds of thrust. These engines offer improved fuel efficiency compared to the Falcon 7X.

Modern Era Programs

This was continued later with the Falcon 6X, which entered service in 2023. It has the tallest and widest cabin in its class and is focused on comfort, efficiency, and performance. The aircraft is powered by Pratt & Whitney Canada PW812D engines that produce around 14,000 pounds of thrust. This gives it excellent performance and a range of 5,500 nautical miles (10,186 km). The Falcon 6X can reach a maximum operating speed of Mach 0.90 (approximately 690 mph or 956 km/h).

The Falcon 10X will be the largest and most advanced Falcon aircraft to date. It has a large and spacious cabin and has been nicknamed an 'apartment in the sky' due to its luxurious yet functional design. t boasts the largest cabin cross-section of any purpose-built business jet and has customizable configurations, allowing for a master bedroom and en suite with a shower. The aircraft has Rolls-Royce Pearl 10X engines and a range of 7,500 nautical miles, so could fly from Los Angeles to Sydney without the need to refuel. It was originally scheduled to enter service in 2025 but due to supply chain issues, it has been rescheduled for delivery in 2027. The Falcon 10X should redefine the top end of the business jet market and will no doubt be a success.

Dassault Aviation has created more than 100 prototypes in the last century and has delivered over 10,000 aircraft to 90 countries. They have over 1,000 military aircraft in service and over 2,150 Falcon jets still in service across the world. The company has approximately 14,600 employees, of which 77% are employed in France. They have a strong global presence and are supported worldwide by a network of service and support facilities.

Leadership, Culture, And Industry Influence

Dassault Aviation was founded by Marcel Bloch in 1929 as Société des Avions Marcel Bloch and adopted the name of Dassault in 1947. In 1971, Dassault acquired Breguet and the company became Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation. In 1990, the company changed its name to Dassault Aviation and became a subsidiary of the Dassault Group. Éric Trappier has been the chairman and CEO and headed the company since 2013 and its headquarters are in Paris, France.

Dassault Aviation is the only European company to produce both military aircraft and business jets. The company places a strong emphasis on research and development and invests significantly in these areas. They have been pioneers in adopting 3D modeling and are leaders in CAD/CAM/CAE and product lifecycle management software. Dassault has always been innovative, as can be seen in their continuous development of advanced technology. They are indeed pivotal when it comes to aerospace research and development and continue to shape the future of both military and civil aviation.

Currently, Dassault Aviation has a strong focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) compatibility and reducing CO2 emissions in aviation. Their Falcon fleet is already certified to fly with SAF blends with 50% non-fossil fuel. SAF fuel, over its life cycle, emits 80-90% less CO2 than fossil kerosene. They are also developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems to boost performance and safety, but at the same time, ensuring humans are at the heart of the decision-making process.

The Legacy Of Dassault Aviation: Past, Present, And Future

Dassault Aviation has always integrated the latest technology from their development of military aircraft into the Falcon family. This includes the fly-by-wire systems and the use of composite materials, as well as avionics such as the EASy (Enhanced Avionics Systems) cockpit that was built on Honeywell's Primus Epic system.

Dassault has always met the demand for larger, longer-range business jets and always listened to their customers. They have always shown a strong emphasis on fuel efficiency and are committed to creating comfortable, luxurious, and functional cabins. Dassault continues a long legacy of innovation, performance, and elegant design of business jets.

The Falcon jet family continues to grow and innovate whilst pushing boundaries. It's no wonder that Dassault and the Falcon family are one of the front-runners in business aviation. Currently in manufacture are the Falcon 2000LXS, the Falcon 900LX, the Falcon 6X, the Falcon 8X, and the new Falcon 10X, expected in 2027.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/main-image-16_9-13-5.png,N,,2025-04-28 08:56:07.832473

""Das von der ADAC Luftrettung initiierte und finanzierte Forschungsprojekt wurde in enger Zusammenarbeit mit dem Deutschen Zentrum für Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR), den Triebwerksherstellern Safran Helicopter Engines aus Frankreich und RTX’s Pratt & Whitney Canada sowie dem Hubschrauberhersteller Airbus Helicopters durchgeführt.

Die Erkenntnisse für die Projektverantwortlichen und Forschenden: Wenn SAF-Blend statt reinen Kerosins verbrannt wird, sinken bei einer Leistung, wie sie typischerweise vor dem Start am Boden erbracht wird (Idle), die Emissionen ultrafeiner Partikel um 44 Prozent, bei einer Leistung wie beim Fliegen in Einsatzgeschwindigkeit (Cruise) um 33 Prozent. Zusätzlich sinkt der CO2-Ausstoß über den Lebenszyklus des Flugkraftstoffs von der Herstellung bis zur Verbrennung, weil die wiederverwendeten Fette und Öle CO2-neutral sind und die CO2-lastigen fossilen Bestandteile ersetzen.

Während bei den ultrafeinen Partikeln signifikante Unterschiede messbar waren, wurden bei den Verbrennungsgasen Kohlendioxid (CO2), Kohlenmonoxid (CO) und Stickoxid (NOx), einem Indikator für die reibungslose Funktion der Triebwerke, keine Veränderungen nachgewiesen.

Une phase de concertation préalable réglementaire auprès du public va débuter lundi 28 avril pour se terminer le 20 juin. Le calendrier prévisionnel avance une mise en service pour 2030. On fait le point sur les caractéristiques et les objectifs de cette nouvelle usine.

À quoi cette usine va-t-elle servir?

Le projet H2V Thionville prévoit la création d’une unité de production d’hydrogène vert par électrolyse de l’eau, d’une capacité de 200 mW, ainsi qu’une autre dédiée à la production de carburants de synthèse, autrement appelés e-méthanol. L’objectif chiffré est d’arriver, à terme, à une production annuelle de 30.000 tonnes d’hydrogène vert, ayant pour but d’engendrer la création de 150.000 tonnes par an d’e-méthanol.

Cet hydrogène vert sera ensuite expédié vers le réseau de stations de distribution d’hydrogène présentes sur le territoire concerné par le projet. Le coût total du projet est estimé à 800 millions d’euros. Celui-ci visera à créer 140 emplois, dont 80 directs. RTE va gérer le raccordement électrique par une liaison souterraine de 225.000 volts.

De telles réalisations sont également en cours d’élaboration sur trois autres pôles industriels français: Dunkerque, Fos-sur-Mer et Le Havre. L’endroit n’a d’ailleurs pas été choisi au hasard pour la Moselle: «Le territoire est un emplacement absolument stratégique, avec la proximité du Luxembourg et de l’Allemagne, pour mener d’importants projets de décarbonation», selon Alexis Martinez, directeur général d’H2V.

Il estime que le Luxembourg aura besoin, à terme, de la présence de ces unités à proximité de son territoire pour décarboner son industrie dans les décennies à venir.

La mise en service de H2V Thionville vise également à répondre à des défis d’utilisation de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, ou ‘’carburant d’aviation durable’’) et de e-SAF (ou ‘’e-kérosène’’).

La part d’utilisation de SAF et d’e-SAF doit en effet se conformer à des objectifs de plus en plus importants au fil des années. De 2% de SAF en 2025, cette portion doit passer à 70% d’ici 2050, dont 35% d’e-SAF. L’e-méthanol produit à Thionville sera quant à lui acheminé vers les sites de Dunkerque et du Havre, qui se concentrent uniquement sur l’hydrogène vert, et pourrait également servir à alimenter Fos-sur-Mer, qui produira déjà de l’e-SAF.

Pour Rémy Dick, vice-président de la communauté d’agglomération du Val de Fensch, «ce projet va permettre la reconversion d’une friche industrielle du territoire et d’implanter un nouveau type d’industrie», dans un contexte où de nombreuses suppressions de postes sont attendues au niveau du site ArcelorMittal de Florange, la ville dont il est également maire.

Quel est le calendrier prévisionnel du projet?

Le calendrier prévisionnel de cet ensemble a été présenté à l’occasion de la conférence de presse de ce vendredi. Il se décompose en huit temps, de la concertation préalable à la mise en service:

La concertation préalable: d’avril à juin 2025

Le dépôt des dossiers par H2V, incluant les demandes d’autorisation environnementale et de permis de construire: fin 2026

L’instruction des demandes: entre 2026 et 2027

L’enquête publique: premier semestre 2027

La publication du permis de construire et des arrêtés préfectoraux d’autorisation: fin 2027

La décision finale d’investissement: fin 2027

Le démarrage du chantier: début 2028

La mise en service de l’usine: 2030

En parallèle, puisque le projet doit faire l’objet d’une autorisation environnementale spécifique, une étude d’impact est en cours pour analyser les conséquences d’une telle installation sur l’environnement.

À noter que le site sera classé Seveso seuil bas. «Ce qui ne veut pas dire que tout risque d’exploser à tout instant, c’est une classification réglementaire», nuance Jean-Charles Louis, président du syndicat mixte E-LOG’IN 4 et vice-président de la communauté d’agglomération Portes de France-Thionville chargé du développement des zones d’activité.

Où en sont les trois autres projets de H2V?

Le projet H2V Thionville ne saurait exister ni se pérenniser sans les trois autres, tous en cours de développement, dans trois places fortes de l’industrie maritime française.

H2V Normandy, le site normand qui sera dédié à la production d’hydrogène vert à Saint-Jean-de-Folleville, près du Havre, est le premier à avoir obtenu les autorisations et le permis de construire. Sa mise en service est prévue pour 2026.

En ce qui concerne celui de Dunkerque, également centré sur la production d’hydrogène vert, son avenir est plus incertain. Bien que les autorisations préfectorales et les permis de construire aient été obtenus il y a déjà plusieurs années, ArcelorMittal a annoncé fin 2024 le report de sa collaboration dans le cadre de son projet d’acier décarboné. Pour le moment, le dossier ne semble pas avoir avancé, alors que la mise en service était initialement prévue pour 2027.

Enfin, la concertation préalable pour H2V Marseille-Fos s’est achevée en décembre 2023. Les permis de construire et l’autorisation environnementale devraient être délivrés cette année. La mise en service est espérée pour 2029. Ce site intégrera une production d’hydrogène vert, mais aussi d’e-méthanol et d’e-kérosène.

Comment va se dérouler la concertation préalable?

Tout comme le calendrier prévisionnel du projet, la concertation préalable sera divisée en huit temps d’échange:

Une réunion publique d’ouverture au Digital Lab d’ArcelorMittal à Uckange, mardi 29 avril à 18h,

Un «débat-mobile» au centre commercial E. Leclerc de Fameck, mercredi 30 avril au matin,

Une réunion thématique à l’IUT de Thionville-Yutz, jeudi 15 mai à 18h,

The Fuel Store is an immersive concept store by AirCo, a Brooklyn-based startup that turns captured CO2 and hydrogen into synthetic fuels.
Previously called Air Company, AirCo has turned captured CO2 into all sorts of consumer products, including vodka, hand sanitizer, and perfume, since it was founded in 2017.
In April, AirCo fuel partnered with the Air Force for the first-ever unmanned flight powered by CO2-derived jet fuel.
The Fuel Store will be open to the public from April 30th to May 3rd at 55 Great Jones Street, New York.","In the lower Manhattan neighborhood of NoHo, the crowded area around Lafayette Street was once called Gasoline Alley because of the many auto shops and gas stations housed there. While New York is still crowded with cars, gas stations in Manhattan are now more rare (there are none today in Gasoline Alley, only one left in all of lower Manhattan.) But off of Lafayette, there’s a new kind of space-inspired gas station that reveals the future of fuel—a future in which we power vehicles across land, air, and sea with CO2 instead of fossil fuels.

The Fuel Store is an immersive concept store by AirCo, a Brooklyn-based startup that turns captured CO2 and hydrogen into synthetic fuels. Most people don’t think about their fuel all that much, or don’t know that there are options other than fossil-fuel derived gas. The Fuel Store is meant to introduce people to AirCo’s technology, and paint a possible future where CO2 powers everything from motocross bikes to jets to spaceships.

Previously called Air Company, AirCo has turned captured CO2 into all sorts of consumer products, including vodka, hand sanitizer, and perfume, since it was founded in 2017. In 2024, AirCo raised $69 million in a Series B round, and the company also has a $65 million contract with the Department of Defense; its raised over $100 million in total, according to Pitchbook. With just under 120 employees, it’s lab and R&D operations are located in Brooklyn.

Recently its been focusing on fuel, because that’s an industry where it can have substantial impact. “It’s one of the hardest industries traditionally to decarbonize,” says cofounder and CEO Gregory Constantine. Transportation is the largest contributor to the U.S.’s greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 28% of all direct emissions. Globally, aviation alone counts for 2% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.

AirCo instead uses CO2—a greenhouse gas—as a feedstock. It combines that CO2 with hydrogen to create fuels through a process that runs on renewable energy. Though AirCo declined to share how much CO2-derived fuel it currently produces, it does have partnerships with multiple companies for the use of its sustainable aviation fuel, called Airmade. In 2022, JetBlue signed an intent to purchase 25 million gallons of Airmade over five years, and Virgin Atlantic signed an intent to purchase up to 100 million gallons over 10 years. The company has also has partnerships with Boom Supersonic, and the U.S. Department of Defense. For the government, AirCo has worked on projects for land, air, and sea transportation.

The Fuel Store showcases these different developments. When you first walk in, you see a shiny chrome gas station in the center of the room—an AirCo branded awning over sleek, futuristic pumps. A motocross bike is attached to one pump, meant to represent the freedom to “roam,” just like how AirCo’s fuels can be made either in remote locations or in cities. Along the walls are a series of products designed to tell different aspects of AirCo’s story, and the future of fuel the company envisions.

On one shelf are hard-shell suitcases decorated with modern travel stickers, one of which reads, “My plane is on an air-based diet.” The climate impact of transportation has led to some “travel shaming,” Constantine says, but he adds that travel is a part of life. Through its work making sustainable aviation, AirCo is making travel less objectionable, he says.

Next to the suitcases are vintage Air Force bomber jackets, adorned with new AirCo patches. In April, AirCo fuel partnered with the Air Force for the first-ever unmanned flight powered by CO2-derived jet fuel. AirCo’s synthetic fuels are 100% compatible with current aircrafts, unlike hydrogen, which requires new engine designs.

On the other side of the store are life vests made of recycled signal flags, a nod to the company’s successful tests with the Navy to use Airmade for marine vessels. (These tests powered boats while also emitting less visible smoke in the exhaust.) The signal flags themselves mean “urgent” and “full speed,” echoing the company’s perspective on its mission to decarbonize fuel. Above the life vests are dry bags made from upcycled sails, an ode to how sailboats, powered by air, were once the dominant form of sea travel—and how air, through AirCo’s CO2 fuel, could power future marine vessels.

Objects like the motocross bike, a mini toy AirCo fuel truck, and vintage Army T-shirts screen-printed with an image of a Polaris MRZR tactical vehicle—which AirCo successfully powered with its CO2-derived fuel through tests at West Point—showcase AirCo’s fuel use on land.

And finally, the Fuel Store also hints at AirCo going into space. One wall features a conceptual Mars helmet and workwear suit. These imagine a future where the red planet’s atmosphere—which is 95% CO2—could be harvested to power spacecrafts, rovers, and habitats. AirCo also has a long-running partnership with NASA.

“A lot of the work that we do with groups like NASA is to try to prove out that we can produce a fuel not only here on Earth made from CO2 but potentially, in the long-term future, up on Mars, so that we can bring astronauts back,” Constantine says. AirCo also created bacon, egg, and cheese space food, a nod to the classic New York City sandwich and the company’s home base.

Each of these products has tags that explain their connection to AirCo’s larger story. Though these items won’t be for sale at the Fuel Store, they will be available via auction online after the concept store’s run is over. That auction will help fund AirCo’s research and development. Visitors will be able to purchase AirCo merch like T-shirts, socks, and some of the stickers that appear on the luggage (including ones that read “honk if you love unlimited feedstocks” and “Make love, not CO2”).

The Fuel Store will be open to the public from April 30th to May 3rd at 55 Great Jones Street, New York. Constantine hopes the concept store is able to shed light on AirCo’s technology, and the hopeful future it envisions.

“Educating people about the future is a tricky challenge, but it can be an inspirational one,” he says. The origins of fuel, and these new technologies like fuel made of CO2, can be foreign to people, but the store puts them in an immersive world full of that technology’s use cases. “What we’ve tried to do here,” Constantine adds, “ is to show what the future can look like in a way that others haven’t been able to do.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/04/13-91323803-futuristic-gas-station.jpg",N,,2025-04-28 06:56:28.754867

Results showed the engines running on the SAF blend emitted significantly fewer ultrafine particles (UFPs) compared with pure kerosene, says the DLR.
During idle operation shortly before take-off, researchers found a 44% reduction in UFPs, while at engine power levels typical for cruise flight, UFP levels were 33% lower.
No notable changes were found to the exhaust gases, it adds, “demonstrating that the engines run smoothly and reliably with the SAF blend”.","German researchers have found a sharp reduction in particulate emissions from helicopters burning a 38% blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), following a “first-of-a-kind” study.

Working in collaboration with emergency medical services operator ADAC Luftrettung, Germany’s DLR aerospace research centre sought to examine the combustion behaviour and performance of the SAF blend, with a focus on the emissions of ultrafine particles and gases, including carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides.

During the trial, ADAC conducted 1,800 flight hours using a pair of Airbus Helicopters H145s, powered by kerosene and biofuel made from used cooking oil in concentrations of up to 38%.

Researchers from the DLR’s Institute of Combustion Technology supported the evaluations with six ground-based measurement campaigns using its mobile measurement laboratory at Bonn-Hangelar airfield after the end of each helicopter’s shift.

This, says DLR researcher Tobias Grein, contains instruments “capable of detecting ultrafine particles as small as seven nanometres”.

Results showed the engines running on the SAF blend emitted significantly fewer ultrafine particles (UFPs) compared with pure kerosene, says the DLR.

During idle operation shortly before take-off, researchers found a 44% reduction in UFPs, while at engine power levels typical for cruise flight, UFP levels were 33% lower.

No notable changes were found to the exhaust gases, it adds, “demonstrating that the engines run smoothly and reliably with the SAF blend”.

Hailing the success of the “first-of-its-kind” campaign, Grein adds: “These measurements were particularly exciting, and it was a unique experience for our team to conduct them ‘live’ on a helicopter just prior to take-off.”

Collecting the measurements required a “delicate touch” from the pilot, applying the throttle on the ground as if preparing for take-off − without actually leaving the ground.

ADAC says it will now expand its research and development activities with alternative fuels, increasing the percentage of SAF in the blend.

“Our long-term goal is to significantly advance the decarbonisation of aviation, including in the emergency services sector,” says Frederic Bruder, ADAC managing director.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/5/2/6/109526_adactestingcdlr_794136.jpg,N,,2025-04-28 06:56:33.763076

The suppliers are Associated Energy Group (AEG FUELS) from the United States, COSMO Oil Marketing Company from Japan, and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation from Taiwan.

EVA Air President Clay Sun said that protecting the environment is a responsibility, not just a choice. He explained that working with these three companies shows the airline’s strong commitment to cutting carbon emissions. By bringing in SAF at its airports in North America, Japan, and Taiwan starting in the second quarter of 2025, EVA Air hopes to lower its impact on the environment and push the aviation industry toward greener practices.

The airline already meets European Union rules that require SAF to be used on flights from Europe. Since early 2025, all EVA Air flights leaving Europe have been using a small amount of SAF mixed with regular jet fuel. The new agreements will now allow the airline to use SAF more widely around the world.

Each supplier will play an important role. AEG FUELS is a well-known supplier that can support EVA Air in many locations. COSMO will supply SAF in the Kansai area of Japan, which is important because the Osaka-Kansai Expo will take place there until October 2025. Formosa Petrochemical Corporation is the first company in Taiwan to produce SAF locally, which will strengthen Taiwan’s ability to supply fuel without depending on other countries.

On April 23, 2025, EVA Air took an important step by using Taiwan-made SAF for the first time on two international flights: one from Taipei Songshan Airport to Seoul’s Gimpo International Airport, and another from Kaohsiung International Airport to Kansai International Airport in Japan. This was part of a government pilot programme and showed that Taiwan’s own SAF production is ready for real use.

EVA Air has made many changes over the past few years to protect the environment. It has bought newer, more fuel-efficient planes like the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350-1000 and improved flight routes to use less fuel.

The airline says it will continue to increase its use of SAF and work with others to create a more environmentally friendly future for air travel.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF.jpg,N,,2025-04-28 08:56:47.726346

The pharmaceutical sector is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, producing 55% more CO₂ per million dollars of revenue than the automotive industry. As a world-leading Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO), PCI Pharma Services supports 200 clinical trial protocols annually across more than 100 countries. Our Storage, Distribution, and Returns services rely extensively on depot storage facilities and a combination of ground and air transportation, provided through one of our strategic partners, Marken, UPS Healthcare Precision Logistics, to ensure the timely and secure delivery of life-saving medications worldwide.

The Challenge

PCI Pharma Services has committed to reducing Scope 3 emissions intensity by 25% by 2030, a target pending validation from the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). Achieving this ambitious goal necessitated the identification of a cost-effective emissions reduction strategy for our specialized shipping and logistics operations; one that would maintain the highest standards of quality and operational efficiency.

The Solution: Green Investment Pilot

To address this challenge, PCI partnered with Marken to participate in its three-month Green Investment Pilot. This initiative sought to generate measurable and cost-effective reductions in carbon emissions while maintaining uninterrupted service. The pilot prioritized the integration of sustainable fuels, such as Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) for ground transportation and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for air transport, alongside renewable energy adoption for warehouse operations.

Framework of the Green Investment Pilot

Marken designed the pilot to streamline and incentivize corporate investment in emissions reduction through a book-and-claim system. This approach ensured immediate carbon capture recognition upon processing, aligned with the Smart Freight Centre’s (SFC) Market-Based Balance Model (MBBM) framework. The initiative also fostered supplier partnerships to improve long-term biofuel accessibility and drive demand. To ensure data integrity and procedural transparency, Marken collaborated with an SFC-accredited emissions calculation provider and an independent audit firm for validation across both air and ground transport modalities.

“Reducing supply chain emissions in pursuit of our joint climate goals requires close collaboration, and flexible, cost-effective solutions that don’t disrupt operations. At Marken, we are grateful to work with ambitious partners like PCI Pharma Services, proving that together, real and scalable impact is possible.” — Sandra Voss, Director, Global Sustainability, Marken, UPS Healthcare Precision Logistics

PCI’s Role in the Pilot

As a participant in the Green Investment Pilot, PCI:

Identified High-Impact Sites: We selected three high-volume sites in the UK and the US to maximize the potential benefits of the initiative.

Seamless Integration: As an established Marken partner, PCI leveraged existing account numbers for streamlined emissions tracking and billing.

Tailored Investment Strategy: We set investment levels on an account basis, applying them at the shipment level to align with actual fuel consumption.

The pilot aimed to assess whether a minimum standard investment rate of 0.5% of invoiced services could yield up to an 8% reduction in carbon emissions across all participating accounts. Marken’s operational teams facilitated this by utilizing a network of certified, second-generation biofuels for air and ground transportation.

Outcomes and Impact

The pilot successfully reduced over 150 metric tons of carbon emissions across all participants, with PCI alone achieving a total reduction of 13.9 metric tons. With minimal financial investment, PCI realized an absolute emissions reduction of over 18% across specialty clinical shipments, primarily driven by SAF utilization.

Beyond carbon reductions, the pilot demonstrated significant operational and strategic benefits:

Effortless Implementation: The initiative required no operational disruptions, serving as an all-in-one solution to reduce Scope 3 emissions.

Alignment with Sustainability Targets: Marken’s annual emissions reductions align with SBTi criteria, enhancing PCI’s ability to report progress on its sustainability commitments.

Regulatory Compliance Risk Mitigation: The initiative supports compliance with global and local emission reduction regulations, reducing future regulatory risks.

Industry-Wide Decarbonization Support: By participating in this initiative, PCI contributed to accelerating decarbonization efforts within the logistics sector.

Looking Ahead

Tim Hansen, ESG Director at PCI Pharma Services, remarked: “The pilot seamlessly integrated into our operations and provided a cost-effective approach to reducing emissions within our supply chain. Marken proved to be a highly reliable partner throughout the program, and the results have surpassed our expectations. We eagerly anticipate expanding our collaboration in the future.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/RYyQR6koz95R8FULpriYhg3jve3XmUtpMESxeV8LwJ8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9pU3RvY2stMTQ4ODMwMjAzOF8zNDA0LTIwMDB3aWRlLnBuZw==.webp,N,,2025-04-28 05:56:16.477686

Two ADAC Luftrettung helicopters flew a sustainable aviation fuel blend combining bio-kerosene and conventional kerosene.

A DLR team conducted a measurement campaign to analyse the emitted ultrafine particles and combustion gases.

The findings revealed a significant reduction in ultrafine particles in the exhaust gases.

Focus: Aviation, energy, climate-compatible flying, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), bio-kerosene, measurement technology

The German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt; DLR) has partnered with the non-profit organisation ADAC Luftrettung – the German air rescue service – to conduct a pioneering research campaign examining the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) in rescue helicopters. For the trial, two ADAC Luftrettung helicopters completed over 1800 flight hours using a blend of conventional kerosene and SAF. The blend contained up to 38 percent SAF produced from recycled vegetable or animal fats, such as used cooking oil. Researchers from the DLR Institute of Combustion Technology supported the long-term trial with a total of six ground-based measurement campaigns. They examined the combustion behaviour and performance of the SAF blend, with a particular focus on analysing the emissions of ultrafine particles and gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ).

Significantly fewer soot particles with reliably high performance

DLR measurements showed that engines running on the SAF blend emitted significantly fewer ultrafine particles (UFPs) – commonly known as soot – compared to pure kerosene. During idle operation shortly before take-off, when rotor speeds are already high, researchers recorded a 44 percent reduction in UFPs. At engine power levels typical for cruising flight, particle emissions were 33 percent lower. The DLR team also found no notable changes in exhaust gases, demonstrating that the engines run smoothly and reliably with the SAF blend.

SAFs are an important step towards more climate-compatible aviation. These innovative fuels can be engineered to produce significantly fewer soot particles when burned, benefiting both the environment and the climate. In addition, the carbon dioxide released during combustion originates from renewable sources, such as plants and animals, which took in carbon dioxide during their lifetimes. This means net carbon dioxide emissions over the fuel's entire lifecycle are also substantially reduced.

Using DLR expertise to track even the tiniest particles

""For this first-of-its-kind measurement campaign, we deployed our mobile DLR measurement lab, which contains highly specialised measurement and analysis instruments capable of detecting ultrafine particles as small as seven nanometres,"" explains DLR researcher Tobias Grein, who oversaw the project. ""Before each measurement campaign we develop a tailored approach, carefully determining the setup, the position of the measuring probe and the duration of each measurement. This meticulous preparation ensures reliable and comparable data"". Tobias concludes: ""These measurements were particularly exciting, and it was a unique experience for our team to conduct them 'live' on a helicopter just prior to takeoff.""

""Following these promising first results, we aim to expand our research and development activities in this field and increase the SAF content,"" explains Frédéric Bruder, Managing Director of ADAC Luftrettung. ""Our long-term goal is to significantly advance the decarbonisation of aviation, including in the emergency services sector. Scientific partners like DLR, with their extensive expertise and many years of experience, play a vital role in ensuring the success of such projects.""

Advancing science and aviation

DLR's measurements provide detailed emission analysis categorised by particle size. Until now, helicopter emissions were largely estimated using approximation methods. ""Thanks to these measurement campaigns with ADAC Luftrettung, we now have new, significantly more accurate data collected under real-world operational conditions,"" explains Tobias Grein, highlighting the importance of this work for research and the aviation sector. ""This data can be used for extrapolations, simulations and modelling, allowing us to assess aviation's environmental and climatic impacts with much greater precision.""

The DLR Institute of Combustion Technology, based in Stuttgart, specialises in optimising combustion processes to reduce emissions. Through close collaboration with industry and other research institutions, it plays a key role in the development and testing of sustainable fuel alternatives. To this end, it offers unique expertise, particularly in measurement technologies and their practical applications.

Abstract

Low carbon fuel policies such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), Canada Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR), and California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) as well as the 45Z tax credit are intended to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation. Cellulosic feedstocks, optimized biorefineries, and favorable farming locations can significantly reduce biofuel carbon intensity (CI). Despite the emergence of field-to-fuel GHG monitoring technologies that could verify such benefits, policy-specific requirements for CI accounting procedures may limit fuel producers’ ability to capitalize on these opportunities. This work examines a hypothetical biomass-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathway using miscanthus and alcohol-to-jet (i) to demonstrate how GHG accounting requirements drive estimates of biofuel CIs and (ii) to explore potential CI and financial benefits of scenario-specific life cycle assessment (LCA). Results demonstrate that GHG accounting using the CFR and LCFS can reasonably account for distinct levels of net electricity production by a biorefinery, but only the CFR yields similar CI sensitivity to spatially explicit factors (feedstock CI, grid electricity CI) as scenario-specific LCA: most GHG accounting frameworks do not capture CI variation across candidate sites in the United States. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the importance of LCA methodological specifications in low carbon fuel policies and tax credits.

Die wichtigsten Ergebnisse sind deutlich weniger ausgestoßene ultrafeine Partikel, umgangssprachlich Ruß sowie die uneingeschränkte Leistung und Einsatzbereitschaft der beiden mit SAF betankten Helikopter. Negative Auswirkungen auf Technik und Triebwerke der Maschinen waren während des gesamten rund dreijährigen Forschungsbetriebs nicht messbar. Das von der ADAC Luftrettung initiierte und finanzierte Forschungsprojekt wurde in enger Zusammenarbeit mit dem Deutschen Zentrum für Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR), den Triebwerksherstellern Safran Helicopter Engines aus Frankreich und RTX’s Pratt & Whitney Canada sowie dem Hubschrauberhersteller Airbus Helicopters durchgeführt.

Die ADAC Rettungshubschrauber „Christoph Rheinland“ aus Köln und „Christoph Europa 1“ aus Aachen/Würselen flogen in Summe mehr als 1.800 Stunden zur Rettung von Menschenleben mit einem sogenannten SAF-Blend im Tank, womit ein Gemisch aus bis zu 38 Prozent SAF aus nachhaltigen Rohstoffen wie recycelten pflanzlichen Fetten und herkömmlichem Kerosin des Typs JET-A1 gemeint ist. Als sogenanntes Drop-In-Fuel kann SAF grundsätzlich mit herkömmlichem Kerosin gemischt werden.

Erkenntnisse für Projektverantwortliche und Forschende

Die Erkenntnisse für die Projektverantwortlichen und Forschenden: Wenn SAF-Blend statt reinen Kerosins verbrannt wird, sinken bei einer Leistung, wie sie typischerweise vor dem Start am Boden erbracht wird (Idle), die Emissionen ultrafeiner Partikel um 44 Prozent, bei einer Leistung wie beim Fliegen in Einsatzgeschwindigkeit (Cruise) um 33 Prozent. Zusätzlich sinkt der CO2-Ausstoß über den Lebenszyklus des Flugkraftstoffs von der Herstellung bis zur Verbrennung, weil die wiederverwendeten Fette und Öle CO2-neutral sind und die CO2-lastigen fossilen Bestandteile ersetzen.

Während bei den ultrafeinen Partikeln signifikante Unterschiede messbar waren, wurden bei den Verbrennungsgasen Kohlendioxid (CO2), Kohlenmonoxid (CO) und Stickoxid (NOx), einem Indikator für die reibungslose Funktion der Triebwerke, keine Veränderungen nachgewiesen. Parallel dazu untersuchten die Triebwerkshersteller regelmäßig ihre eigene Technik in den beiden Helikoptern vom Typ Airbus H145 („Christoph Rheinland“ mit Safran-Triebwerken) und Airbus H135 („Christoph Europa 1“ mit Pratt-&-Whitney-Triebwerken). Verglichen mit dem Verschleiß beim Verbrennen von herkömmlichem Kerosin konnten sie keine relevanten Unterschiede feststellen.

Frédéric Bruder, der Geschäftsführer der ADAC Luftrettung, betonte zum Abschluss des internationalen Langzeitprojektes die Vorreiterrolle der fliegenden Gelben Engel bei der Verwendung von Biokerosin und mit Blick auf den Klimawandel auch deren gesellschaftliche Verantwortung, bei der Dekarbonisierung der Luftfahrt treibende Kraft zu sein. Er kündigte nach den vielversprechenden ersten Ergebnissen an: „Wir möchten Forschung und Weiterentwicklung auf diesem Gebiet noch vertiefen und den SAF-Anteil weiter erhöhen“. Langfristiges Ziel der ADAC Luftrettung sei es, die Beimischung auf bis zu 100 Prozent zu erhöhen und in der Folge auch den Einsatz von synthetischem E-Fuel, auch Power-to-Liquid-Kerosin (PtL) genannt, zu ermöglichen. PtL bezeichnet die Erzeugung flüssiger (Liquid) Brenn- oder Kraftstoffe mithilfe von elektrischer Energie (Power) aus erneuerbaren Quellen.

Historie des Pilotprojekts und Ausblick

Den Start des in dieser Form einmaligen Forschungsprojekts markierte der erste Flug eines Rettungshubschraubers, einer H145 der ADAC Luftrettung, mit 40-prozentiger SAF-Beimischung im Sommer 2021 in München. Im Dezember desselben Jahres startete die ADAC Luftrettung gemeinsam mit dem DLR, Safran Helicopter Engines und Airbus Helicopters ihre Untersuchungen zu den langfristigen Effekten von SAF des Flugkraftstoff-anbieters Air bp auf die Technik von Maschine und Triebwerken mit „Christoph Rheinland“. Für eine breitere wissenschaftliche Basis wurde in Kooperation mit RTX’s Pratt & Whitney von Dezember 2021 an zusätzlich „Christoph Europa 1“ mit SAF-Blend des Multi-Energie-Konzerns TotalEnergies betankt. Im Sommer 2025 soll auch er 1.000 Einsatzstunden absolviert haben. Die Projektbeteiligten erwarten sich vergleichbare Ergebnisse.

Statements der Projektpartner

Deutsches Zentrum für Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR):

„Für die in dieser Form erste und bisher einmalige Messkampagne hatten wir unser mobiles DLR-Messlabor im Einsatz. Darin befinden sich spezielle Mess- und Analysegeräte. Diese sind geeignet, um ultrafeine Partikel bis zu einer Größe von sieben Nanometern zu untersuchen. Vor jeder Messkampagne erarbeiten wir ein individuelles Konzept und legen Aufbau, Position der Messsonde sowie die Dauer der Messungen fest. Nur so erhalten wir zuverlässige und vergleichbare Daten, beschreibt Forscher Tobias Grein vom Institut für Verbrennungstechnik des DLR, der das Projekt DLR-seitig betreut hat.

Key Priorities for Egypt’s Aviation Future To continue maximizing aviation’s benefits, IATA outlines three major priorities for Egypt: 1.
Building Capacity for a Skilled Aviation Workforce A strong and future-ready workforce is fundamental to the long-term resilience and safety of Egypt’s aviation industry.
A digitally literate and sustainability-conscious workforce will be key to adapting to industry changes and future-proofing Egypt’s aviation sector against potential disruptions.
Egypt’s aviation sector is at a pivotal juncture.","Aviation stands as a pillar of Egypt’s economy, contributing significantly to employment, trade, and tourism development. A recent study released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has measured the vital economic and employment benefits that the aviation sector, including aviation-related tourism, generates for Egypt. Based on 2023 data, aviation’s impact is not only substantial but poised for further growth as the government leverages the sector strategically for national development.

Economic and Employment Impact

According to the IATA study, the aviation industry, encompassing airlines, airports, supply chains, and tourism, generates USD 21.1 billion in economic activity—equivalent to 5.3% of Egypt’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This robust contribution reflects both the direct benefits of aviation operations and the wider impact through related industries.

In terms of employment, aviation supports nearly 1.4 million jobs across Egypt. This includes not only airline staff but also workers across the broader aviation value chain and the thriving tourism sector, which heavily relies on air connectivity. Of these, 32,800 people are directly employed by airlines, underscoring the industry's critical role in job creation.

Moreover, Egypt's aviation industry handled a staggering 338,600 tonnes of air cargo in 2023, showcasing its significance in facilitating trade and commerce, and enhancing the country's integration into global supply chains.

Aviation’s Strategic Role in National Development

The importance of aviation to Egypt extends beyond pure economic figures. Following a recent meeting with Dr. Sameh Elhefny, Egypt’s Minister of Civil Aviation, Kamil Alawadhi, IATA’s Regional Vice-President for Africa and the Middle East, emphasized aviation’s role as a strategic enabler for Egypt’s broader economic and social ambitions.

“Aviation is a key contributor to Egypt’s economy. Directly and through its well-developed tourism industry, aviation supports nearly 1.4 million jobs. And over 5% of Egypt’s GDP has close links to aviation,” said Alawadhi. He further noted the government’s commitment to aligning the aviation sector with global standards and best practices, particularly in critical areas like safety, sustainability, cost-efficiency, and skills development.

The Egyptian government’s aviation strategy is also closely linked to its Vision 2030, aiming to diversify the economy, stimulate private investment, and foster sustainable development.

Key Priorities for Egypt’s Aviation Future

To continue maximizing aviation’s benefits, IATA outlines three major priorities for Egypt:

1. Cost-Efficiency in Infrastructure Development

Egypt is making substantial investments to modernize and expand airport infrastructure, notably at Cairo International Airport, Borg El Arab Airport, and Sphinx International Airport. IATA stresses the importance of collaborative consultation with airline operators during these developments to ensure cost-efficiency.

By adhering to international best practices, Egypt can avoid imposing unnecessary financial burdens on airlines and passengers, preserving the affordability and competitiveness of its aviation sector. Transparent pricing, regulatory stability, and efficiency in operations are essential to attract more airlines and increase passenger traffic, especially as Egypt looks to strengthen its position as a regional hub.

2. Sustainability and Decarbonization Initiatives

Egypt has made promising moves in aviation sustainability. In collaboration with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the country is developing the capability to produce 120,000 tonnes of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) annually.

This initiative supports Egypt’s Vision 2030 sustainability objectives and contributes to the global aviation industry's goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Access to affordable, locally-produced SAF will not only reduce Egypt’s carbon footprint but also position it as a leader in green aviation practices in Africa and the Middle East.

Furthermore, Egypt’s hosting of COP27 in 2022 elevated its profile as a committed player in climate action, and investments in sustainable aviation are a logical extension of that leadership.

Typical jet fuel costs per flight The cost of jet fuel per flight depends greatly on a number of factors, including the length of the flight, the number of passengers onboard, and the aircraft used to operate the flight.
The increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is also a factor to consider when looking at jet fuel usage and costs.
Relative stability in jet fuel prices - for now Since reaching their peak in the summer of 2022, fuel prices have stabilized somewhat.
The cost of jet fuel for US airlines per flight varies greatly, depending on the length of the flight and the aircraft used.","Jet fuel is one of the key ingredients that make up air travel. In fact, it may well be the most important - after all, without it, aircraft would not be able to fly. The price of jet fuel is highly volatile and can be greatly affected by external events such as political or economic instability. This, in turn, has a significant impact on the aviation industry as a whole.

The varying cost of jet fuel can greatly impact major carriers such as American Airlines' operational and financial performance. In this article, we examine the typical jet fuel costs of some of the major airlines in the US. We will also consider what future jet fuel prices might look like and the impact that any changes could have on the industry.

One of the largest individual costs

Jet fuel represents one of the biggest single outlays for an airline, often totaling billions of dollars per year. This is, of course, together with the cost of purchasing or leasing the aircraft themselves and the costs involved in recruiting and retaining highly skilled and engaged employees.

According to the latest statistics from Statista, carriers worldwide spent a total of $291 billion on jet fuel in 2024. This increased from $271 billion in 2023 and $215 billion in 2022.

Naturally, 2020 and 2021 were anomalies as they were greatly affected by the global downturn in air travel during and just after the pandemic. Airlines worldwide spent a total of $80 billion and $106 billion in these two years, respectively. In 2019, this figure was $190 billion, showing how carriers today are spending more than $100 billion more per year on jet fuel than they were five years ago.

Fuel hedging - it can make or break an airline

Fuel hedging is when airlines lock in a fixed price for their jet fuel purchases over a given timeframe. This helps them overcome any fluctuations in the market price of jet fuel. For example, an airline may agree to purchase its jet fuel from a given supplier at $500 per ton for three years.

However, it is a very complex technique to get right, and airlines can potentially lose a lot of money if things do not go to plan. But when it does work, they can achieve a significant financial advantage over their competitors.

Using the above example of a pruchase price of $500 per ton:

If a carrier agrees to purchase jet fuel for $500 and prices rise to $700 per ton during that time, it will benefit greatly from its hedging deal.

If prices fall to $300 per ton during that time, the carrier will be at a significant disadvantage and may even fail to survive financially.

Fuel consumption by US airlines has increased

According to the Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the total quantity of fuel consumed by US airlines in December 2019, the final 'normal' year before the COVID-19 pandemic, was 1.55 billion gallons per month.

However, following several uncertain years throughout the pandemic, fuel usage by US airlines had risen to 1.59 billion gallons per month in December 2024. This represents an increase of 0.04 billion gallons (or 2.7%) over five years.

When comparing December 2024 with the same period in 2023, there was a slight increase from 1.58 billion gallons of jet fuel used by US airlines per month.

Changes in jet fuel prices over time

Given that crude oil is used to produce jet fuel, the price of jet fuel is greatly dependent on that of crude oil, and can vary greatly, as shown in the graph below from the International Air Transport Association (IATA):

At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when air travel was brought to a standstill across the world, demand for jet fuel plummeted, and so did prices. In May 2020, jet fuel was available for just $200 per metric ton.

However, the sudden surge in demand for air travel following the removal of COVID-related travel restrictions caused prices to rise drastically, peaking in June 2022 at more than $180 per barrel. In addition to fluctuations in demand, geography can also affect jet fuel prices, with differences of up to $12 per barrel between different regions of the world. Unsurprisingly, the Middle East is home to some of the world's cheapest jet fuel.

Typical jet fuel costs per flight

The cost of jet fuel per flight depends greatly on a number of factors, including the length of the flight, the number of passengers onboard, and the aircraft used to operate the flight. Although it is no longer operated by any US airlines, the iconic Boeing 747 provides a clear example of jet fuel prices. When operating a typical flight from New York John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to London Heathrow Airport (LHR), the 747 burns approximately 73,000 kg of fuel. If using the price of $0.67 per kg, this equates to a total cost to the airline of $48,800. With 450 passengers onboard, this works out at $108 in fuel costs per passenger.

When it comes to the Airbus A380, the so-called Superjumbo typically burns 11,000 - 12,000 kg of fuel per hour. On a standard seven-hour flight across the Atlantic, the aircraft burns in the region of $51,000 worth of fuel. However, both aircraft are put to shame by more modern, fuel-efficient twinjets such as the Airbus A321neo. On a similar journey across the Atlantic, the A321neo is estimated to burn just $10,000 worth of fuel, highlighting why the aircraft is becoming ever more popular among both US carriers and others around the world.

A clear comparison between the three aircraft is shown in the table below:

Improved fuel efficiencies

Modern aircraft, built of light, composite materials and equipped with highly fuel-efficient engines, typically burn much less fuel per flight than their older counterparts. The comparison of the Boeing 747 vs the Airbus A321neo mentioned above is a clear example of this.

As technologies advance and aircraft manufacturers design ever-more fuel-efficient aircraft, it is highly likely that the fuel cost per flight for airlines will continue to decrease. Wingtips and sharklets are one way in which this can be achieved, with the upcoming Boeing 777X's innovative folding wingtips potentially sparking serious change in how these are used going forward.

The increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is also a factor to consider when looking at jet fuel usage and costs. SAF is a key component in helping airlines across the world work towards their sustainability targets. Currently, it is quite expensive to produce, but as it becomes more commonplace and its price drops, it will help airlines to save significant amounts of money on their fuel bills, as well as reduce their environmental impacts.

Relative stability in jet fuel prices - for now

Since reaching their peak in the summer of 2022, fuel prices have stabilized somewhat. As demand for air travel continues to rise, it is likely that airlines across the US will continue to spend more on jet fuel as they operate more flights.

The cost of jet fuel for US airlines per flight varies greatly, depending on the length of the flight and the aircraft used. For example, a transatlantic flight on a relatively inefficient Boeing 757 is going to cost a lot more in jet fuel than a short hop between the US and Canada on a modern, fuel-efficient Airbus A321neo.

However, in the face of ever-greater political and economic uncertainty, the price of crude oil, and with it jet fuel, is likely to change at short notice. It remains to be seen how airlines across the US and beyond will respond to such changes.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/how-much-do-us-airlines-pay-for-jet-fuel-per-flight-16x9.jpg,N,,2025-04-28 02:56:57.580831

Investments in Arlanda’s Marketplace, a key commercial hub, boosted net revenue. At the same time, international passenger numbers grew, though at a slower pace due to external challenges.

However, Swedish domestic travel has continued to face difficulties, reflecting the general broader market trends.

Swedavia Q1 Financial Performance

Swedavia’s financial results for January to March 2025 were impressive. Net revenue reached SEK 1,510 million, up SEK 67 million from SEK 1,443 million in the same period last year.

This growth came despite a slight dip in passenger numbers. Operating expenses also fell, partly due to a milder winter.

This contributed to an operating loss of SEK -136 million, a significant improvement from last year’s SEK -217 million. Cash flow from operating activities was positive at SEK 191 million, a SEK 134 million increase from 2024.

“Even with fewer passengers, we’ve increased revenue and reduced operating costs,” said Jonas Abrahamsson, Swedavia’s President and CEO. “Our operating profit improved by SEK 81 million compared to last year, showing resilience in a challenging environment.”

Passenger Trends and Market Challenges

In Q1 2025, 6.6 million passengers traveled through Swedavia’s ten airports, a 1.3% decrease from the same period in 2024. This marks the first quarterly decline in passenger numbers since the pandemic.

International travel continued to recover, but growth slowed due to economic and geopolitical uncertainties. Domestic travel, meanwhile, remained weak.

“The world is changing rapidly,” Abrahamsson noted. “Economic and geopolitical shifts, including the ongoing trade war, make it hard to predict the aviation industry’s recovery. We expect the economic upturn to be delayed, which will likely impact air travel demand.”

Stockholm Arlanda’s Growth

Swedavia continued to increase its offerings at Stockholm Arlanda Airport. In January, Japan’s largest airline, ANA, launched a new route to Tokyo Haneda.

Norwegian expanded its Arlanda network with four new destinations, while Ryanair added ten new routes from Arlanda and Göteborg Landvetter.

Ryanair also introduced two new aircraft to its Swedish fleet, moving their start date from July to June to improve summer connectivity across Europe. Norwegian further strengthened Arlanda’s role by reopening its pilot base in the spring.

Infrastructure and Sustainability Investments

Arlanda’s infrastructure upgrades progressed smoothly. In February, the final section of the new Marketplace opened, enhancing the airport’s commercial appeal.

Modernization work on air bridges, stands, and infrastructure near Sky City remains on track. Swedavia also welcomed the Arlanda Coordinator’s interim report in March, which emphasized improving road transport to and from the airport.

The company supports strengthening both road and rail connections to boost Arlanda’s competitiveness and Sweden’s global standing.

Sustainability remains a priority. In January, Swedavia issued a SEK 2 billion green bond to fund eco-friendly projects.

The company also invested SEK 40 million in sustainable aviation fuel for the third consecutive year, bringing its total investment since 2020 to SEK 135 million. These efforts underline Swedavia’s commitment to greener aviation.

Looking Ahead

Despite challenges, Swedavia is optimistic about 2025. The summer season, the busiest travel period, will see airlines expanding routes and capacity.

With ongoing investments in infrastructure and sustainability, Swedavia is well placed to navigate market uncertainties while strengthening Sweden’s aviation hub.

시는 이번 사업을 통해 △이산화탄소 포집·전환 CCU 기술의 실증 및 상용화 기반 구축 △전문인력 양성 및 화학·에너지 플랜트 산업 고용 창출 △청정수소 수요 창출 △기술 내재화 및 장비 국산화를 통한 산업경쟁력 제고 △군산시 경제 활성화 및 이퓨얼 생태계 조성 등의 다각적 효과를 기대하고 있다.

강임준 군산시장은 “이번 공모 선정은 군산시가 탄소중립 도시로 도약하는 중대한 첫걸음”이라며 “앞으로도 정부, 연구기관, 지역사회 및 기업과 긴밀히 협력하여 지속 가능한 녹색산업 생태계를 조성해 나가겠다”고 말했다.

Catalysts

About Darling Ingredients

Develops, produces, and sells natural ingredients from edible and inedible bio-nutrients in North America, Europe, China, South America, and internationally.

What are the underlying business or industry changes driving this perspective?

The positive outlook for renewable fuels public policy, along with the normalization of margins, provides a favorable environment for future cash generation, potentially supporting revenue growth.

The reduction in financial leverage, as evidenced by the $146.2 million debt payment and lowering the financial leverage ratio to 3.33 times, is expected to enhance net margins through reduced interest expense.

Interest in and premiums for sustainable aviation fuel align with a positive future outlook, which may improve both revenues and earnings in the long term.

The anticipated increase in fat prices, due to supply restrictions from tariffs, presents opportunities to improve EBITDA in the Feed segment, signaling potential growth in net margins.

The recovery in the Food segment, bolstered by strong demand for collagen peptides and innovations such as Nextida, projects continued revenue and EBITDA growth through competitive product positioning in 2025.

Darling Ingredients Future Earnings and Revenue Growth

Assumptions

How have these above catalysts been quantified?

This narrative explores a more pessimistic perspective on Darling Ingredients compared to the consensus, based on a Fair Value that aligns with the bearish cohort of analysts.

The bearish analysts are assuming Darling Ingredients's revenue will grow by 2.4% annually over the next 3 years.

The bearish analysts assume that profit margins will increase from 3.0% today to 8.3% in 3 years time.

The bearish analysts expect earnings to reach $508.1 million (and earnings per share of $3.2) by about April 2028, up from $171.6 million today. The analysts are largely in agreement about this estimate.

In order for the above numbers to justify the price target of the more bearish analyst cohort, the company would need to trade at a PE ratio of 16.0x on those 2028 earnings, down from 29.4x today. This future PE is lower than the current PE for the US Food industry at 18.4x.

Analysts expect the number of shares outstanding to grow by 2.33% per year for the next 3 years.

To value all of this in today's terms, we will use a discount rate of 6.21%, as per the Simply Wall St company report.

Darling Ingredients Future Earnings Per Share Growth

Risks

What could happen that would invalidate this narrative?

The transition from the blender's tax credit to the producer's tax credit and the complexity surrounding it could temporarily impact Darling Ingredients' sales and feedstock eligibility for fuel types, potentially impacting short-term revenue and net income.

With DGD's first-quarter EBITDA significantly lower compared to last year due to macro events in the biofuel market, there is a risk that ongoing volatility in biofuel prices could continue to negatively impact earnings and balance sheet health.

Uncertainty and complexity regarding tariffs and supply chain adjustments for imported feedstocks pose ongoing risks that could lead to additional costs, affecting overall company margins and net profit.

The renewable fuels market has faced substantial noise and uncertainty, impacting forward sales volumes and margins. This ongoing uncertainty, including potential changes in policy, could unpredictably affect revenue and EBITDA.

Despite improvements in feed and fat prices, competition in the market, along with potential weather-related disruptions and changes in the geopolitical landscape, could negatively impact raw material costs, thereby affecting revenue and gross margins.

Valuation

How have all the factors above been brought together to estimate a fair value?

The assumed bearish price target for Darling Ingredients is $40.2, which represents one standard deviation below the consensus price target of $47.8. This valuation is based on what can be assumed as the expectations of Darling Ingredients's future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors from analysts on the more bearish end of the spectrum.

However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $60.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $34.0.

In order for you to agree with the bearish analysts, you'd need to believe that by 2028, revenues will be $6.1 billion, earnings will come to $508.1 million, and it would be trading on a PE ratio of 16.0x, assuming you use a discount rate of 6.2%.

Given the current share price of $31.88, the bearish analyst price target of $40.2 is 20.7% higher.

We always encourage you to reach your own conclusions though. So sense check these analyst numbers against your own assumptions and expectations based on your understanding of the business and what you believe is probable.
