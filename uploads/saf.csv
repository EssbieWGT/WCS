The figure below shows how growing imports have supported U.S. BBD consumption.
The gap was filled by more imports of vegetable oil, fat oil, and grease.
Greater demand for vegetable oil will increase its price, likely around 12% based on a previous analysis of the relationship between biodiesel demand and global vegetable oil prices.
This is perhaps unsurprising, as current growth in vegetable oil production is concentrated in Brazil and Indonesia, where agricultural expansion often relies on high carbon-stock forested land.","In the last 20 years, the U.S. transportation fuel landscape has transformed: electric vehicles emerged as a clear path to zero-emissions road transport while growth in domestic oil production eliminated U.S. dependence on imported oil. Yet the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a 2005 law requiring the use of biofuels in transport, remains stuck in an era when biofuels seemed like the only option to reduce transportation greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The latest proposal from EPA doubles down on this outdated vision. It would raise food and fuel costs for consumers by increasing the amount of biomass-based diesel (BBD) mandated under the program without delivering meaningful GHG emission benefits.

EPA’s proposal increases renewable volume obligations (RVOs), the mandatory volumes that specify how much biofuel must be supplied. It also halves the compliance value of imported fuel or fuel produced from imported feedstocks by reducing the generation of renewable identification numbers (RINs)—credits used for compliance with renewable fuel blending mandates. For every gallon of biofuel produced from imported feedstock, twice as much fuel must be supplied to meet RFS obligations. Fuels like biodiesel produced from imported used cooking oil now generate half the compliance value of a domestic fuel, such as soy-derived biodiesel.

EPA justifies these changes by emphasizing the economic and energy security benefits of domestic feedstocks. However, overall U.S. consumption of fats and oils for fuel and other purposes such as cooking and animal feed already exceeds total domestic production. Instead of supporting domestic feedstock producers, the proposal would increase U.S. reliance on imported fats and oils.

The figure below shows how growing imports have supported U.S. BBD consumption. In 2019, domestic fat and oil production met 84% of demand. By 2024, this had fallen to 68%. The gap was filled by more imports of vegetable oil, fat oil, and grease. The United States turned from a net exporter of 0.6 million tonnes in 2019 to a net importer of 3.1 million tonnes in 2024.

As illustrated by the figure, U.S. fat and oil imports would dramatically increase under the proposal; net vegetable oil imports are projected to surge by around 5 million tonnes (from 6.1 to 11.0 MMT). Greater demand for vegetable oil will increase its price, likely around 12% based on a previous analysis of the relationship between biodiesel demand and global vegetable oil prices.

However, a more dramatic price spike is possible. As described in EPA’s Draft Regulatory Impact Assessment, the 2020–2022 vegetable oil price shock that increased global prices from $700 to $1,800 per metric ton was likely caused by biofuel-driven demand and weather-related supply disruptions. The projected 5 million tonne net increase in U.S. vegetable oil imports is equivalent to 6% of the current global vegetable oil trade, creating a risk of short-term price spikes as global oilseed production responds to the additional demand.

According to EPA analysis, this huge increase in BBD consumption will not even meaningfully reduce U.S. GHG emissions, with savings equivalent to less than 1% of road sector emissions at best. One EPA model even suggests that the use of crop-based BBD fuels would increase GHGs. This is perhaps unsurprising, as current growth in vegetable oil production is concentrated in Brazil and Indonesia, where agricultural expansion often relies on high carbon-stock forested land. Indeed, groundbreaking work from Chen et al. has found that that global demand for BBD between 2002 and 2018 drove the conversion of approximately 1.7 million hectares of forest to oil palm. This means continued market-mediated oil crop expansion could very well offset any emissions reductions from additional BBD use in the United States.

Finally, the proposal’s claims of energy security benefits are unconvincing. Will energy security really be improved by replacing a domestic energy source (petroleum) with one we have to import? And while EPA assumes that the United States will remain the preferred destination for BBD feedstocks globally, this isn’t guaranteed. Changing policies in China have dramatically reduced used cooking oil exports to the United States, and sustainable aviation fuel mandates in the European Union and United Kingdom will heighten competition for feedstock.

Overall, EPA projects its current proposal will saddle consumers with $6.8 billion in extra fuel costs and $2.4 billion in higher food prices each year, all without meaningful emissions cuts or improved U.S. energy independence. Twenty years in, we need a wholesale reconsideration of the Renewable Fuel Standard— the inconsistencies of EPA’s proposal show exactly why reform is needed.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/iStock-1412869394.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 13:56:17.052504

“Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are a core element of our sustainability strategy.","From 2027, Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) will purchase at least 200 tons of solar jet fuel from Synhelion annually, pioneering the use of this innovative fuel in civil aviation. The agreement marks an important milestone on the road to more sustainable aviation.

Synhelion will produce renewable synthetic crude oil, known as “syncrude”, at its first commercial plant. The syncrude will be processed in anexisting refinery together with fossil crude oil and refined into certified Jet-A-1 fuel. Thus, Synhelion directly replaces fossil crude oil with sustainable syncrude, without the need for any adjustments to the existing infrastructure. The fuel will be delivered to the airport via the regular logistics chain and fed into the fuel supply system. Synhelion’s synthetic jet fuel is based on renewable energy and sustainable feedstocks.

“The partnership with Synhelion is a significant step for SWISS on the path to decarbonizing our flight operations,” says Jens Fehlinger, CEO of SWISS. “Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are a core element of our sustainability strategy. The offtake agreement with Synhelion sends a strong signal for innovation and responsibility in aviation.”

Synhelion also emphasizes the significance of the agreement: “The fact that SWISS, a leading airline, has committed early on to adopt our fuels demonstrates confidence in the market readiness of ourtechnology,” says Philipp Furler, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion. “This partnership is a milestone for the commercial market launch of our fuels – and sets a powerful example to other airlines worldwide.”

(ChiniMandi) India is likely to shift to ethanol-blended aviation fuel by mid-2027, gradually ramping it up in phases, with the addition of more than two dozen distilleries supported by federal biofuel incentives, an official familiar with the details said on Sunday, reported Hindustan Times.

The country, which has the world’s third-largest aviation market, is aiming to introduce 1% ethanol blending in jet fuel by 2027, raise it to 2% in 2028 and further to 5% by 2030. Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol had shared these targets in Parliament earlier this month.

India has already carried out trial flights using cleaner aviation fuel. In March 2023, Air Vistara, which has since merged with Air India, operated a long-haul Boeing 787 flight from the United States to India using fuel blended. In the same year, Air Asia flew the country’s first commercial domestic flight between Pune and Delhi with a fuel blend.

According to the news report, a long-pending policy on sustainable aviation fuel is likely to be released for public consultations next month, the official said, requesting anonymity.

International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has adopted Carbon Offsetting & Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) as a global market-based measure to reduce emissions from international aviation which require offsetting of emissions above a baseline value. Airlines can either use SAF or offset their emissions by purchasing carbon credits from ICAO approved Emissions Unit Programmes. SAF offers a direct pathway to emission reduction by lowering the lifecycle carbon footprint of aviation fuel. When airlines adopt CORSIA Eligible SAF (CORSIA Eligible Fuel) certified against ICAO’s sustainability standards and verified through Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV), they can claim these reductions as substitutes for carbon credits, thereby decreasing their offsetting obligations under the scheme.

The Centre is supporting biofuel projects through the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, which provides financial assistance for setting up plants, including those producing aviation fuel.

Under the scheme, the government offers interest support for five years, including a one-year repayment break, on loans taken to set up new ethanol distilleries. The support covers interest up to 6% per year or half of the bank’s lending rate, whichever is lower.",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 14:56:20.419191

Regulation to simplify the Deforestation-free Products Regulation

On November 26, the European Parliament voted to simplify the Deforestation Regulation. Key changes include granting all companies an extra year to comply and simplifying due diligence requirements. If agreed, compliance timelines would be pushed back to December 30, 2026 for large operators and June 30, 2027 for micro/small enterprises. Due diligence requirements would be also streamlined, placing responsibility on those businesses which first introduce the relevant product to the EU market, as opposed to those who subsequently trade it. Micro and small primary operators will submit a one-off simplified declaration. The current text will now be negotiated between the EU Parliament and Member States before final adoption.

Amendments to the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation

On November 20, the European Commission proposed amendments to the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation. The proposals aim to simplify sustainability disclosures and reduce complexity for in-scope businesses. The new proposal removes some company-level reporting requirements, reduces product-level disclosures to focus on clear, comparable data. It also proposes a simple categorization system for financial products making ESG claims: Sustainable, Transition, and ESG Basics. The Commission’s proposal will now be submitted to Parliament and Council for their deliberation.

Omnibus VI: Chemical Classification Labelling Regulation Amended

On November 17, the Council of the EU approved postponing key provisions of the EU’s Classification, Labelling and Packaging of chemicals (CLP) regulation to January 1, 2028. This ‘stop-the-clock’ measure, part of the Omnibus VI simplification package, delays requirements for relabeling, formatting, advertising, and online sales, which were originally set for mid-2026 and early 2027. The move aims to reduce regulatory burdens, especially for SMEs, while maintaining safety standards. The adopted regulation will be now published in the Official Journal and enter into force 20 days later.

Omnibus I: Sustainable Reporting Requirements

On November 13, the European Parliament adopted its position on amendments to the scope of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. Under its current position, reporting would apply only to large firms with over 1,750 employees and over €450 million net annual turnover, with fewer qualitative details required to be submitted. Sector-specific reporting would become a voluntary process. Due diligence duties would cover very large corporations to include those with over 5,000 employees and an annual net turnover of more than €1.5 billion, using a risk-based approach and relying on existing data. Transition plans would no longer be required, and liability would be at national level. Institutional negotiations are expected to take place and remains unclear if further amendments will be set out.

EU Climate Law Amendment

On November 13, the European Parliament adopted its position on amending the EU Climate Law. The amendment sets out a binding target to cut net GHG emissions by 90% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels. From 2036, up to five percentage points of reductions could come from high-quality international carbon credits, subject to strict safeguards following concerns from the European Commission. MEPs also backed postponing ETS2, covering CO₂ emissions from buildings and road transport, by one year to 2028. This target is set to be reviewed biennially. The European Parliament will now begin negotiations with Member States on the final law.

Legislative Package on One Substance, One Assessment Adopted

On November 13, the Council of the EU adopted the ‘One Substance, One Assessment’ (OSOA) legislative package to streamline chemical safety evaluations across the EU. The new rules aim to speed up regulatory action on chemical risks, improving health and leading to better and faster environmental protection. OSOA also aims to enhance consistency and efficiency in assessments for sectors such as food, toys, pesticides and medical devices. It introduces a common data platform, integrating information from over 70 EU laws and including a database of safer alternatives. The package also clarifies EU agency responsibilities and strengthens institutional cooperation. The adopted acts will be now published in the Official Journal and enter into force 20 days later.

Revision of the New Legislative Framework

On November 12, the European Commission opened a consultation on revising the New Legislative Framework (NFL). The NFL underpins EU product safety rules, CE marking, and market access. The proposed changes aim to simplify requirements, reduce administrative burdens, and improve coherence across sectors, ensuring products remain safe and compliant while supporting sustainability and fair competition. Potential changes include introducing a digital product passport, aiming to support the EU’s circular economy objectives.

Sustainability Reporting Standards Postponed

On November 10, the Quick Fix Delegated Regulation was published, providing targeted relief postponing certain sustainability reporting requirements under the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) framework. This Regulation provides reporting relief to first wave businesses subject to ESRS, allowing businesses to omit certain disclosures, such as anticipated financial effects of sustainability risks until FY2027. Also, businesses with 750 employees or more will also benefit from the same phase-in provisions that apply to businesses with 750 employees or less.

On November 7, the European Commission launched calls for evidence on proposed amendments to the Taxonomy Climate Act and the Environmental Delegated Act. These Acts set technical screening criteria for activities aligned with six EU environmental objectives. The planned changes aim to improve clarity, usability, and legal certainty by simplifying criteria and reducing complexity. Feedback will inform targeted revisions to enhance cost-effectiveness and coherence of the EU Taxonomy framework. The feedback period closed on December 5.

UK

Autumn Budget Announcement

On November 26, the Government announced their Autumn Budget. As part of the budget, the Government put forward a range of sustainability-related measures. The key announcements include:

capital infrastructure will be invested in to support, among other things, greater energy security across the country, with additional investment being announced for “major growth projects”

confirmation the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) would be introduced under the Finance Bill 2025-2026. Indirect emissions within scope of CBAM will be delayed until 2029. The Government is considering including refined products in CBAM in future

confirmation the standard and lower rates of landfill tax would not be merged into a single rate

confirmation the UK Plastic Packaging Tax (PPT) rate for 2026 to 2027 will increase in line with CPI inflation

confirmation a consultation would be launched on the introduction of mandatory certification for mechanically recycled plastic packaging for businesses to claim an exemption from PPT

Planning and Infrastructure Bill

On November 24, the Planning and Infrastructure Bill cleared the House of Lords. The Bill has now returned to the House of Commons, where it will consider the amendments made. Key amendments made by the House of Lords include:

enhanced protections for chalk streams

prioritisation to redevelop of brownfield sites

proposal that the Government publish an assessment of the impact of existing regulations on low-hazard reservoirs and, within six months of the Bill’s enactment, set out proposals for their deregulation

The Bill is sat with the House of Commons, who will review the amendments on December 8.

Employment Rights Bill

On November 15, the House of Commons rejected several House of Lords’ amendments to the Employment Rights Bill. The Bill now returns to the House of Lords to review the government’s stated reasons for rejecting the amendments. These include:

protection from unfair dismissal should apply from the first day of employment

workers who meet the qualifying criteria should automatically receive a guaranteed hours offer, rather than having to request one

the requirement that industrial action is only valid if at least 50% of eligible voters participate in the ballot should be removed

FRC issues ISSA (UK) 5000

On November 12, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) issued International Standard on Sustainability Assurance (ISSA) (UK) 5000, “General Requirements for Sustainability Assurance Engagements”, providing UK companies, investors and assurance providers with internationally aligned voluntary assurance standards. This UK adaptation of the global IAASB standard provides requirements for both limited and reasonable assurance engagements. Designed for voluntary use, it aims to enhance the credibility of sustainability reporting, support informed investment decisions. The standard reflects FRC’s commitment to internationally aligned frameworks, promoting consistent assurance practices and reliable information for investors.

Draft Amendment to the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging and Packaging Waste) (Amendment) Regulations 2025

On November 3, draft regulations amending the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging and Packaging Waste) Regulations 2025 were published. The changes, effective from January 1, 2026, allow deductions for recycled food-grade plastics collected in closed-loop systems, and clarify producer obligations. The amendments aim to close loopholes and simplify compliance for in-scope businesses.

US

Endangered Species Act Regulations

On November 19, 2025, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed four rules under the Endangered Species Act regulations, to require economic impacts to play a greater role in listing decisions and critical habitat designations, narrow the effects that must be considered under Section 7 consultation, and to remove the “blanket rule” that applied the same protections for “threatened” species as those that apply to “endangered” species.

Waters of the United States Rule

On November 17, 2025, the EPA and US Army Corps of Engineers issued a proposed rule to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act. The stated purpose of the rule is to conform the definition with the US Supreme Court’s decision Sackett v. EPA. Among other things, the proposed rule provides jurisdiction over only tributaries connection to traditional navigable waters, provides definitions for “continuous surface connection” and “relatively permanent,” eliminates “interstate waters” from the definition of WOTUS, and revises exclusions for ditches, waste treatment systems, prior converted cropland, and groundwater.

EPA Proposes Amendments to PFAS Reporting

On November 11, 2025 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to amend requirements for businesses to report PFAS use under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The original rule, finalized in 2023, mandated reporting on PFAS usage between 2011 and 2022, related to exposure and any existing environmental and health effects. The proposal introduces exemptions for PFAS in concentrations of 0.1% or lower, imported articles, certain byproducts, impurities, research chemicals, and non-isolated intermediates. Public comments on the revisions will be accepted for 45 days before final rules are issued.

In this category, there are currently more ammonia-ready vessels than methanol-ready vessels, but the orderbook shows methanol leading the charge.
Hanna Campbell, market development director at the Michigan Soybean Committee and managing director for the Michigan Advanced Biofuels Coalition, sees a unique challenge in the maritime industry.
For many years, they have been trialing biodiesel and testing the waters on different decarbonization options.” Even with the consensus for biofuels, Carr raises a critical question.
Number one on the IMO’s list of priorities is creating a level playing field for the maritime industry while maintaining safety and efficiency standards across the globe.","In mid-October, the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee convened for its second extraordinary session to discuss the potential adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework.

With more than 80% of global trade and 40% of U.S. imports and exports moving through the maritime sector, it’s no surprise that decarbonization efforts are increasingly focused on ships operating in both brown waters—navigable inland or coastal routes—and blue, or international deep-sea, waters. And for good reason, according to Ed Carr, partner at Energy & Environmental Research Associates. “If ships were a country, they would be somewhere around Mexico or Japan in terms of their greenhouse gas emissions,” Carr notes. “It’s approximately 2.9 or 3 percent of global emissions, but a small percentage of a very large number is still a pretty big number.

“The marine sector is not one sector, [and] not all ships are created equal,” Carr continues. “Within shipping, you’ve got dozens of different sectors that operate differently because of their needs. The IMO estimates have [the maritime industry’s fuel demand] at 300 to 330 million metric tons (mmt) of residual or HFO-equivalent fuels per year.”

Pete Probst, president and cofounder of Indigenous Energy, notes the steep environmental cost of not decarbonizing the maritime sector. “When you look at CO2 on a life-cycle basis, for every five years that we wait to reduce the carbon emissions, there’s an additional 13 times more carbon carbon accumulated, which we then have to get rid of.”

The benefits of decarbonizing outweigh the upfront costs. That does not mean, however, that the costs are easy to balance.

Reeling in Emissions

While there is no shortage of alternative fuels being used to decarbonize the maritime sector—methanol, ammonia, hydrogen, LNG and biofuels—the move to net-zero emissions is easier said than done. “There are currently more vessels that can fire using methanol than ammonia,” Carr explains. “But the industry is investing in vessels that currently use conventional fuels, but are designed to be able to use alternative fuels with some retrofits. In this category, there are currently more ammonia-ready vessels than methanol-ready vessels, but the orderbook shows methanol leading the charge. The problem is that most are not actually firing on methanol or ammonia right now. Most of the methanol-capable ones may be using some methanol in their firing, but many of them will be predominantly on conventional fuels.

“The energy density of methanol and ammonia is less than half the energy density, both volumetrically and on a mass basis, of conventional bunkers,” Carr continues. “This means that to go the same distance, you need to carry twice as much [fuel], or you can only go half as far,” he continues. “In those situations, you either need to give up cargo space on your vessel in order to carry more fuel, or you need to retool the way that your operations are working and think about refueling more frequently.” The largest container ships can store up to 4.5 million gallons of fuel onboard; giving up cargo space for more fuel or increasing stops could lead to further hurdles.

Hanna Campbell, market development director at the Michigan Soybean Committee and managing director for the Michigan Advanced Biofuels Coalition, sees a unique challenge in the maritime industry. “The [maritime] fueling system is a little bit different as to how vessels get fuel,” she says. “There aren’t as many players in the game; it's not like an over-the-road truck stopping at any truck stop or gas station along the way. Fueling on the Great Lakes is more of a closed system. It’s easier to speak with the different players because there aren’t as many.”

Regardless of the challenges involved in decarbonizing the industry, Campbell, Probst and Carr all agree on what must come next. “If any of this is going to decarbonize, something’s got to fill the gap, which is where biofuels come in,” Carr says, adding that biofuels made from renewable feedstocks like soybean oil are readily available and proven solutions to decarbonize vessels today.

Probst and Campbell both note the easier transition to biodiesel compared to other alternative fuels like methanol and ammonia.

“[Biodiesel] has been around for a long time,” Probst explains. “The technical specs have been ironed out, so there are no issues with runningbiodiesel at all different blends in any type of diesel applications, including marine vessels. You can do that with pre-existing equipment. You don’t have to change anything on the dock in terms of fueling; you don’t have to change anything, really, in the engine or on the vessels. You can use biodiesel just like you would your petroleum diesel.”

Campbell explains the push toward biodiesel in the U.S. Great Lakes maritime system has been spurred by recent domestic triggers, but our northern neighbors are well-versed. “For a lot of companies, specifically on the Canadian side, biodiesel is nothing new. For many years, they have been trialing biodiesel and testing the waters on different decarbonization options.”

Even with the consensus for biofuels, Carr raises a critical question. “All of this stuff comes with a cost premium, right? [Unless] you have a carrier who’s willing to pay that cost premium [or] you’ve got a client who’s willing to say, ‘Yeah, move my goods with lower carbon intensity,’ … why would anybody be willing to take on that investment when their competitors don’t have to?”

In the Wake

This imbalance in capital and other resources is where the value of the IMO lies. Number one on the IMO’s list of priorities is creating a level playing field for the maritime industry while maintaining safety and efficiency standards across the globe. For this reason, the significance of the MEPC’s work in October cannot be understated.

“Decarbonizing ships is comparatively hard to decarbonizing land-based electricity,” Carr says. “Going into [the MEPC extraordinary session], a lot of countries were thinking very positively, and a lot of industry was talking very positively [because] it provided a sense of certainty that these folks would now be able to tailor and operate their businesses … within that framework.”

“Prior IMO policy required a switch to low-sulfur fuel, so the shipping industry is already looking for cleaner, available fuels,” adds Paul Winters, director of public affairs and federal communications at Clean Fuels Alliance America. This opens pathways for alternative fuels. And while each fuel has its role, biofuels—namely, biodiesel and renewable iesel (RD)—are operation-ready today.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework, which was approved by MEPC 83 held in April this year, comprised of new international regulations aligning with the IMO’s 2023 GHG Strategy, including two specific changes: a global fuel standard, and a global GHG emissions pricing mechanism. “The framework was designed not to say you must use methanol or ammonia or hydrogen or biofuels; it was designed to say that the carbon intensity of your fuel starts here, and over time has to get lower. It didn’t put a cap on emissions in total. It just said the carbon intensity of the fuel has to come down,” Carr explains.

“Some folks did not like what was being proposed at the IMO and worked hard to oppose what was going on …Ultimately, they punted a year down the road,” he says. “And some of the arguments were legitimate. There was a big question mark about how the IMO’s financial framework fit with Europe’s financial framework. That was not cleanly addressed in the regulations that were written, and it was an issue that was picked upon by some folks … and there were some other things that were left as guidelines or other things that need to be sorted out.”

With the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework decision pushed to next October, on approval, the start date for the framework has been delayed to 2028. More concerning, the lack of set guidelines marks a time of increased uncertainty in the international sector.

This does not mean, however, that the industry has found itself stalled. In the U.S., the bipartisan Renewable Fuel for Ocean-Going Vessels Act has seen success in the Senate. Introduced to both the Senate and House by Sens. Pete Ricketts (R-NE) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA), John Garamendi (D-CA) and six others, respectively, the legislation would revise the Renewable Fuel Standard to support farmers providing fuel to the maritime sector.

“Right now, the RFS requires biofuel producers to retire RINs from gallons of fuels used in ocean-going vessels. This includes ships operating in the Great Lakes, since they are in international waters,” Winters says. “The Renewable Fuels for Ocean-Going Vessels Act would make a simple change to allow fuel producers to keep the RINs and their value. It has bipartisan, bicameral support. It recently received a hearing in the U.S. Senate, so it can move forward toward adoption in the current Congress.”

Seizing the Seas

An additional area of special interest in the IMO Net-Zero Mandate, Carr says, is regarding whether the application of crop-based biofuels will be allowed. The FuelEU Maritime regulation—the law of the EU maritime land as of January this year—incentivizes lower-carbon alternative fuels; but just like its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) counterpart, ReFuelEU, FuelEU Maritime currently bars crop-based biofuels from eligibility in European markets. “[The crop-based biofuels ban] means that the U.S. markets don’t have access to European markets on that front,” Carr notes. “From a U.S. perspective, that makes a big difference in terms of what’s going out there, and it makes a big difference globally, too, in terms of how much feedstock there’s going to be.”

Until the October 2026 reconvening of the MEPC and further industry guidance, stateside movement toward renewables incentives in the maritime sector remain promising for biodiesel and RD producers. And for some, the policy changes are following behind their own initiatives. Campbell points to the Port of Detroit, which in April 2024 released its Decarbonization and Air Quality Improvement Plan to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2040. “[The Port of Detroit] is very committed to particulate matter emissions and things like that specifically for the benefit of the communities around the port,” she says. “That commitment helps spur on folks at the terminals and ships coming through.”

Under current RFS guidelines, Winters says, U.S. biodiesel and RD producers are discouraged from supplying to the maritime sector. “They’re missing an opportunity to serve a multibillion-gallon fuel market,” he adds. “Since biodiesel and renewable diesel production represents 10% of the value of all domestically grown soybeans, expansion of the market would directly benefit U.S. farmers and feedstock providers.”

Those benefits, Campbell notes, would include opportunities for biodiesel producers to sell more of their product locally. “There are two biodiesel producers in Michigan, and traditionally a lot of their biodiesel tends to leave the state,” she says. “The maritime market is a big opportunity to keep that circular biodiesel ecosystem here.”

Despite the delay in international guidelines, Carr says the first steps have been made. “Shipping was poised and really on the edge of the first global GHG standard, which is a big deal. It didn’t end up happening—yet. Hopefully it will, but just the fact that an industry that moves in the way that shipping does—historically having taken its time to ensure that things are safe and not going to be a hazard to operate—and was willing to engage in that, I think that says a lot about what’s happening now.”

Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) and Swiss cleantech company Synhelion have signed a long-term offtake agreement for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). From 2027, SWISS will purchase at least 200 tons of solar jet fuel from Synhelion annually, pioneering the use of this innovative fuel in civil aviation. The agreement marks an important milestone on the road to more sustainable aviation.

SWISS is the first airline to sign a binding five-year SAF offtake agreement with Synhelion. This marks a pioneering step toward defossilizing aviation. From 2027, Synhelion will produce renewable synthetic crude oil, known as “syncrude”, at its first commercial plant. The syncrude will be processed in an existing refinery together with fossil crude oil and refined into certified Jet-A-1 fuel. Thus, Synhelion directly replaces fossil crude oil with sustainable syncrude, without the need for any adjustments to the existing infrastructure. The fuel will be delivered to the airport via the regular logistics chain and fed into the fuel supply system. Synhelion’s synthetic jet fuel is based on renewable energy and sustainable feedstocks.

A strong signal for sustainable aviation

“The partnership with Synhelion is a significant step for SWISS on the path to decarbonizing our flight operations,” says Jens Fehlinger, CEO of SWISS. “Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are a core element of our sustainability strategy. The offtake agreement with Synhelion sends a strong signal for innovation and responsibility in aviation.”

With this offtake agreement, SWISS is actively supporting the scaling of Synhelion’s technology for the production of renewable synthetic fuels as a customer, investor, and strategic partner. This long-term planning certainty enables targeted expansion of production capacity and helps reduce costs over time.

Pioneering partnership

Synhelion also emphasizes the significance of the agreement: “The fact that SWISS, a leading airline, has committed early on to adopt our fuels demonstrates confidence in the market readiness of our technology,” says Philipp Furler, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion. “This partnership is a milestone for the commercial market launch of our fuels – and sets a powerful example to other airlines worldwide.”

Expanding the partnership with Kuehne+Nagel

Part of the renewable jet fuel produced by Synhelion will be resold by SWISS to the logistics service provider Kuehne+Nagel. The company will use the sustainable fuel for air freight transportation with Swiss WorldCargo, offering its customers a tangible solution to reduce their carbon footprint in global logistics.

First delivery already completed

In July 2025, SWISS became the first airline in the world to use solar fuel from Synhelion in regular flight operations. Synhelion delivered its first barrel of syncrude from its DAWN plant to a refinery in northern Germany, where the syncrude was processed into certified jet fuel (Jet-A-1) and subsequently fed into the fuel supply system via Hamburg Airport.

The gas is collected from industrial sites and injected deep into rock formations, where it can stay for thousands of years. This method prevents emissions from entering the atmosphere but comes with risks, including leaky storage facilities, and a high price tag. Still others sell captured CO2 to oil companies for enhanced oil recovery. A recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that carbon capture and storage remains among the least effective and most expensive emissions solutions when compared with renewable energy.

Airco takes a different approach. Instead of burying CO2, the company converts it into new products. It began with small consumer items, such as vodka and perfume, to prove out its chemistry.

NEW YORK, Dec. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- A report from MarketsAndMarkets said that the global sustainable fuel market in terms of revenue was estimated to be worth $193.8 billion in 2024 and is poised to reach $299.9 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 9.1% from 2024 to 2029. Rising concerns about climate change, stringent government regulations to reduce carbon emissions and reduced dependency on fossil fuels are few of the factors accelerating the growth of sustainable fuel market. According to other industry data, the low-carbon fuels market is experiencing massive growth, with the overall sustainable/low-carbon fuel market projected from approximately USD 190-200 Billion (2024/2025) to over $300 Billion by 2029-2030, driven by biofuels and advanced fuels (especially SAF) with CAGRs often above 30-60%. Specific segments like Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) could hit over $350B by 2035, while Carbon Capture (CCS) markets are forecast to reach $50B+ by the 2030s, highlighting significant investment and revenue potential across different low-carbon platforms. The MarketsAndMarkets report continued, saying: ""The sustainable fuel market is expected to witness healthy growth during the review period due to growing demand for energy efficiency and transition towards renewable energy sources. Asia Pacific is expected to be the second largest market during the forecast period. Increasing adoption of alternative fuels to curb carbon emissions is anticipated to offer lucrative opportunities for market players in the next five years."" Active companies in the markets this week include DevvStream Corp. (NASDAQ: DEVS), XCF Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: SAFX), Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ: GEVO), GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV), Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE: BEP).

MarketsAndMarkets continued: ""Global economies' efforts to diminish their carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions have spurred the adoption of clean and sustainable energy alternatives. The increasing energy demand driven by rapid industrialization and urbanization has further hastened the shift towards renewable energy sources. This transition has prompted economies to utilize renewable energy sources such as biomass, hydroelectric, and geothermal power. For instance, vehicles can utilize biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel, derived from renewable biomass sources such as corn, sugarcane, and soybeans. Similarly, hydrogen fuel cells can use green hydrogen, another renewable energy source. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), biofuels and renewable electricity could reduce oil demand in the transportation sector by nearly 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2028. This reduction would help to limit the global carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions.""

DevvStream (NASDAQ:DEVS), Southern Energy, and XCF Global Announce Plan to Pursue Strategic Collaboration to Build Integrated Low-Carbon Fuels Platform and Advance Multi-Pathway SAF Strategy - MOU outlines plans for the development of a unified commercial platform combining fuel supply, logistics, and environmental-attribute value for aviation and industrial customers - DevvStream Corp. ($DEVS) (""DevvStream""), Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (""Southern""), and XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq: SAFX) today announced a non-binding tripartite memorandum of understanding (""MOU"") to jointly explore the potential development of a next-generation low-carbon fuels platform designed to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel (""SAF"") adoption, expand domestic capacity, and integrate environmental-attribute monetization into a unified customer offering.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, while global demand is expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, with ~4 billion people living in countries that utilize SAF for air transportation, driving the global market past ~$25 billion. Looking ahead to 2050, the global SAF market could exceed ~$250 billion. This collaboration is intended to position the parties with a unified platform that directly supports this long-term growth.

The goal of the collaboration is to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways, and to advance the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes. As part of the negotiation of a binding agreement, the parties expect to evaluate the commercial viability of developing a HEFA-based ""Gen 1"" SAF facility in Louisiana alongside Southern's previously announced biomass-based ""Gen 2"" SAF gasification facility.

Potential Unified Commercial Platform & Strategic Integration - The parties intend to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement which, if executed, would create a collaborative venture that intends to develop a unified commercial platform that enables customers to procure fuel, logistics services, and environmental-attribute value through a single integrated offering. If developed, this structure would be expected to simplify procurement, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance long-term customer retention across the aviation and industrial markets.

Potential Environmental-Attribute Monetization and Digital Infrastructure - A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform's low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (""LCA"") methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

""This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform, linking production, logistics, and environmental-attribute systems into a seamless value chain,"" said Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF. ""If we succeed in combining Southern's developmental stage biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology, DevvStream's environmental-attribute and digital MRV capabilities, and XCF's HEFA production and commercial infrastructure, we see the potential to build a revolutionary end-to-end system that unlocks new value for customers and potentially accelerate the scaling of SAF in a disciplined, capital-efficient way.""

SAF projects are reaching maturity.
That means long-term political certainty and globally coherent policy frameworks.
With stable, predictable policy, we can unlock the next wave of SAF supply and help aviation deliver the climate transition this decade demands.","2025 will be remembered as the year sustainable aviation fuel finally began to scale. After a decade of pilot schemes and policy debate, the global aviation sector has entered a new phase, one driven by firm regulation, clear ambition from airlines, and the rapid build-out of SAF projects across multiple pathways.

For those of us working to bring new production online, the momentum is real. But there are risks as well. Events this year suggest that, despite unprecedented progress, political uncertainty still plays a notable role in shaping SAF investment.

Regulation Is Moving in the Right Direction, and Fast

The past 18 months have seen the most supportive policy signals the SAF industry has ever received.

The UK has led from the front, putting its SAF mandate into law and giving the market a timetable that matters: 2% in 2025, 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. The UK’s decision to pair this mandate with a revenue certainty mechanism is unique globally: a recognition that early-stage industries need predictable conditions, not just aspirations.

Europe has also stepped up, with ReFuelEU Aviation now live. A binding 6% SAF requirement by 2030 and a trajectory to 70% by 2050 is already reshaping demand curves for airlines and suppliers.

And globally, airlines themselves have set a tone of ambition that often surpasses government expectation. Many now have 10% SAF targets for 2030, and several have signed multi-year offtake agreements that would have been unthinkable five years ago. Engine manufacturers and OEMs are certifying fleets for 100% SAF. Infrastructure owners are preparing for higher blends.

The direction of travel is no longer in doubt: aviation is preparing for a SAF-powered future.

A Wave of Projects Is Taking Shape from the US to the UK

This policy foundation is enabling real deployment. Across North America and Europe, dozens of first-of-a-kind and next-of-a-kind facilities have entered the final stages of engineering, financing or construction. The diversity of technologies and feedstocks coming forward mirrors exactly what the sector needs: Fischer–Tropsch, alcohol-to-jet, gasification routes, and advanced pyrolysis all now have commercial backers and blue-chip customers.

Natural State Renewables is proud to be part of this next chapter. Our flagship project in Arkansas will convert waste wood residues into high quality SAF, with a delivery horizon aligned to the UK’s 2030 mandate. We’ve spent years building a robust feedstock position and a pathway designed to meet the world’s most stringent sustainability standards. It is exactly the kind of project mandates were designed to enable.

As a U.S. producer, we see a tremendous opportunity to work with partners across the UK and Europe to help meet early mandate requirements while domestic capacity scales. Our goal is to complement — not compete with — the region’s growing SAF ecosystem by providing reliable, certified volumes that support near-term demand and strengthen supply-chain resilience as new plants come online.

Across the sector, the progress is striking. Capital is flowing. Technical risk is falling. Producers, airlines and suppliers are collaborating in ways that would have once seemed impossible.

But Momentum Does Not Guarantee Deployment

Political uncertainty has become a significant consideration for SAF investment. Behind the headlines and policy announcements, producers face a common reality: SAF facilities are large, capital-intensive projects that depend on long-term confidence in the regulatory environment.

And right now, that confidence remains fragile.

Across multiple jurisdictions, including those most committed to SAF, there is still uncertainty on future incentives, programme design, and the longevity of support. Changes in government, budget pressures, and shifting political narratives all add risk premiums to project finance.

Investors tell us the same thing: the technology risk is manageable; the market risk is understood; but the political and policy risks remain material.

Without long-term clarity on sustainability criteria, revenue support, accounting rules, and mandate enforcement, producers cannot reach final investment decision at the pace the sector demands. The result is delayed projects, higher capital costs, and slower emissions reductions for aviation.

In short: the key challenge for SAF today is less about engineering and more about policy consistency.

A Strong 2025, But the Market Must Now Move Faster

The good news is that these risks are solvable. Governments have already shown they are willing to take bold, industry-shaping decisions. The UK mandate, in particular, demonstrates that political leadership can give investors exactly what they need: a predictable, rules-based environment where long-term capital can move with confidence.

What comes next is simple but urgent:

clearer long-term signals on revenue support

stability in sustainability and feedstock rules

alignment across jurisdictions to reduce compliance friction

political consistency across electoral cycles

If governments can deliver that certainty, the industry will deliver the rest. We have the feedstocks. We have the pathways. We have the airline demand. What we need now is a policy environment that stays stable for the lifespan of an SAF plant.

Conclusion: A Once-in-a-Generation Opportunity, If We Seize It

2025 has been a turning point. Mandates are in place. Demand is locked in. SAF projects are reaching maturity. The sector has never been more aligned or more ambitious.

But to translate that ambition into tangible decarbonization — steel in the ground, supply into airports, emissions reductions at scale — we must turn momentum into permanence. That means long-term political certainty and globally coherent policy frameworks.

The UK has taken major steps in the right direction, and that leadership matters. If other jurisdictions follow suit, global SAF deployment will accelerate dramatically.

For producers like Natural State Renewables, the message is clear: the opportunity is enormous, the technology is ready, but investment decisions depend on confidence. With stable, predictable policy, we can unlock the next wave of SAF supply and help aviation deliver the climate transition this decade demands.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/693fe57091d6583479ab86d7/1765874828063/4.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-12-16 10:57:41.546494

Kuehne+Nagel, a global leader in logistics, and Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS), Switzerland’s flagship carrier, have announced an expansion of their strategic partnership aimed at accelerating sustainable aviation initiatives. The two companies have formalized their collaboration through a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that focuses on leveraging innovative technologies to improve operational efficiency while reducing environmental impact.

Commitment to Sustainable Aviation Fuel

At the heart of this partnership lies a shared commitment to the development and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced by Synhelion, a Swiss clean technology firm. Synhelion employs a proprietary process that harnesses concentrated sunlight to convert biogenic and recycled carbon into renewable synthetic fuels, including solar jet fuel. By supporting this cutting-edge technology, Kuehne+Nagel and SWISS seek to contribute meaningfully to the long-term decarbonisation of the aviation sector.

To facilitate the scaling of production and foster further innovation, Kuehne+Nagel, SWISS, and its air freight division Swiss WorldCargo have entered into a long-term SAF off-take agreement. This arrangement provides Synhelion with the necessary planning security to expand its production capacity and advance its technology. Such commitments are considered essential for nurturing emerging SAF producers and encouraging wider adoption of sustainable fuels across the industry.

Starting in 2027, Kuehne+Nagel will purchase SAF produced by Synhelion from SWISS under a five-year contract, specifically for use in cargo shipments operated by Swiss WorldCargo. This agreement highlights Kuehne+Nagel’s dedication to decarbonising global logistics and offers its customers a tangible means to reduce the carbon footprint of their air freight operations.

Challenges and Industry Implications

Despite the promising outlook, the transition to sustainable aviation faces significant challenges. Both Kuehne+Nagel and SWISS must navigate potential regulatory obstacles, the complexities of establishing reliable SAF supply chains, and the substantial investments required for new infrastructure. While the partnership is likely to be well received by sustainability-focused investors, some skepticism remains regarding the feasibility and timeline for achieving the ambitious environmental targets set forth.

The announcement is expected to prompt competitive responses within the logistics and airline sectors, with other companies likely to increase their investments in sustainable practices to maintain market relevance. This dynamic could accelerate industry-wide efforts toward sustainability, driving further innovation and the adoption of cleaner technologies.

Kuehne+Nagel and SWISS present their collaboration as a practical example of how airlines and logistics providers can work together to support innovative solutions and expedite the transition to more sustainable aviation. SWISS CEO Jens Fehlinger emphasized the importance of such partnerships, stating, “Sustainable aviation fuels are a key building block for making air travel more sustainable.

To move past abstract assessments and guesswork, global consultancy firm dss+ has developed a practical, stepwise framework that quantifies financial exposure into a clear ‘Value at Risk’ framework.

With the global climate crisis enacting high economic tolls around the world, climate risk is no longer seen as just an abstract sustainability issue related with compliance. It is a real business risk and companies are increasingly aware of the need to take concrete action.

For executive teams, the primary challenge is identifying precisely where climate change affects operations, assets, and long-term growth. They must then determine the most cost-effective path to adaptation.

This approach narrows the focus to actions that matter most, giving leadership a solid basis for prioritization, investment, and accountability. This framework is designed to provide a defensible calculation of financial exposure and consists of ten distinct steps, summarized in the dss+ ‘Road to climate resilience’ workflow.

Source: dss+

Step 0: Organizational Maturity Assessment

Before taking concrete action, it is vital to understand an organization’s current maturity in managing physical climate risks. dss+ uses the Bradley Curve to evaluate this maturity. This scale ranges from a reactive state – driven by compliance – to an interdependent state, where climate resilience is embedded across all functions.

This assessment highlights the gap between the current state and what is required to reduce climate risk to as low as reasonably possible.

Step 1: Identify climate hazards

The process begins by identifying climate hazards, such as temperature extremes, wildfire risk, and tropical storms that could impact operations or the supply chain. Hazards should be shortlisted by focusing on those expected to change significantly over time, using data such as historic incidence, insurance data, and academic research. To maintain a practical analysis, the number of hazards should be limited to no more than ten.

Step 2: Review and shortlist receptors

After climate hazards have been identified, the next step is to understand how they can impact systems or components, referred to as receptors. This review is conducted at the site or operations level and must cover all locations in the value chain.

The approach includes reviewing peer annual reports, examining literature on common receptor vulnerabilities, and analyzing existing site assessments. Targeted reviews and site visits of critical components also help to map key system elements and product flow paths.

Step 3: Potential vulnerability

Next is to synthesize climate hazards and receptors into a Vulnerability Matrix to assess how each hazard could impact critical systems, operations, and the value chain. An initial analysis identifies known vulnerabilities, such as increased temperature driving higher cooling demand, for example.

This analysis is then validated through site visits and engagement with experts, such as maintenance engineers and facility managers. Preliminary hotspots are flagged based on potential infrastructure damage, increased maintenance, production losses, and risks to personnel safety.

Step 4: Quantify Value at Risk

With various vulnerabilities now identified, they are now translated into financial terms by developing damage functions. These mathematical models can estimate potential losses for each receptor-hazard combination under specific climate scenarios.

The outcome is a clear visualization of the Value at Risk (VAR) across the value chain, which enables the identification of financial hotspots and guides cost-effective adaptation strategies. These climate risk assessments should also factor asset condition and maintenance into damage functions for VAR calculations to be as accurate as possible.

Step 5: Estimate probability and financial impact

The most significant risks are identified using a simple five-by-five risk matrix that combines probability and impact. Probability ranges from ‘possible to occur’ to ‘multiple events at the site’, while impact spans from negligible to catastrophic.

Each vulnerability is scored, and multiplying the risk rating by its VAR provides a clear view of financial exposure across the value chain. Climate-driven changes should also be taken into account for an updated profile on operational risks that threaten staff. This ensures decisions reflect both financial and human exposure.

Step 6: Identify adaptation options

This step focuses on developing a comprehensive portfolio of adaptation measures – structural, nature-based, policy, and behavioral – targeting the highest VAR first. Organizations should start with quick wins, such as early warning systems and emergency response plans, before progressing to capital-intensive solutions like infrastructure upgrades and flood defenses. The goal is to create a full ‘wish list’ of potential actions, regardless of initial cost or complexity.

Step 7: Marginal adaptation cost curve

The Marginal Adaptation Cost Curve (MACC) ranks adaptation measures based on their cost-effectiveness in reducing VAR. Each option is plotted according to its implementation cost and the degree to which it lowers financial exposure, providing a clear visual for prioritization.

The MACC considers the entire value chain and accounts for multiple options addressing the same vulnerability. This tool identifies the most cost-effective interventions that deliver the greatest risk reduction.

Step 8: Build an integration roadmap

To minimize VAR within operational and capital constraints, the analysis is translated into a practical, prioritized adaptation roadmap. Multi-criteria decision analysis is used to weigh technical feasibility, cost, social impacts, and institutional capacity, setting clear implementation milestones.

The roadmap must be technically robust but also realistic for an organization to execute. It should align with capital allocation processes and integrate into day-to-day operations and long-term planning.

Step 9: Financing climate risk reduction

Financing determines the pace and scale at which climate risks can be reduced. The quantified VAR, MACC, and roadmap provide the foundation for investment decisions, enabling companies to prioritize the highest-impact, lowest-cost interventions. Companies can either opt to self-fund these initiatives, or look to climate finance, which leverages external funding sources like concessional loans, grants, and resilience bonds.

Step 10: Climate risk program management

Climate risk management is not a one-time exercise but a continuous improvement program designed to maintain momentum in reducing VAR. Success requires embedding resilience into the organization through mindset, governance structures, management processes, capabilities, and enabling technologies.

Companies that succeed establish a cross-functional project management office to monitor progress and lift roadblocks, ensuring organizational success factors are implemented in parallel with technical solutions. Automation is critical to ensure efficient reassessment aligned with annual budget cycles and updates to global climate models.

“This is not just about compliance – it is about safeguarding assets, operations and growth in a changing climate,” said Gerhard Bolt, principal at dss+. “Organizations that adopt this structured approach will not only reduce risk but also unlock competitive advantage through resilience, cost efficiency and stakeholder confidence.”",https://www.consultancy.eu/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-12-16-092454619-Mastering_climate_risk_dss__framework_sets_out_a_10-step_approach_2.jpg?webp,N,,2025-12-16 10:58:13.859475

This came during the ninth edition of Al-Ahram’s Energy Conference, where he gave the breakdown of the figure, noting that Italy’s energy giant Eni will invest $8 bn, the UK-based bp will inject $5 bn, and the remaining $3.7 billion will be provided by ARCIUS Energy (a joint venture between bp and ADNOC’s subsidiary XRG).

The minister boasted the fact that the petroleum sector has shifted from a period of decline to a phase of stability, with natural gas production increasing gradually for the first time in four years, and the crude oil output is projected to achieve self-sufficiency within five years.

The petroleum ministry has implemented a series of measures to stimulate upstream activity, including paying nearly $1 billion of arrears to IOCs, introducing new investment incentives, and revising production-sharing agreements to include the R-Factor system.

These reforms have encouraged foreign investors to expand their operations, leading to multiple discoveries across Egypt, the most recent of which are: North El-Basant 1 exploratory well, which contains initial reserves of 15–25 billion cubic feet (bcf) and the Northeast Ramadan Crystal (NER-1X) well, with output estimated at 8 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscf/d) in the Nile Delta region.

The ministry launched a Red Sea international bid round via Egypt Upstream Gateway (EUG), available until Sunday 3rd of May 2026 at 12:00 PM. This is in addition to plans to drill 480 exploration wells over the next five years, alongside expanding seismic surveys covering 100,000 square kilometers onshore the Western Desert in addition to 95,000 square kilometers offshore the Eastern Mediterranean using Ocean Bottom Node (OBN) technology.

During the conference, Badawi highlighted the ministry’s plan to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and boost investment opportunities in green energy projects, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), green ammonia, and bioethanol

In December, Qatar committed $200 million to build a SAF production facility in the Ain Sokhna Integrated Zone, the first Qatari industrial investment in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE), which will convert cooking oils into 200,000 tons per year (t/y) of hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), biopropane, and bionaphtha.

The strategy emphasises clean cooking, cross-border energy trading, energy efficiency, innovation, and capacity development, setting the foundation for multi-billion-dollar investments across African countries, according to a statement the pan African bloc seen by APA on Tuesday.

The strategy was launched at the African Energy Efficiency Conference (AfEEC) that was concluded over late last week following the adoption of a communique requiring a collective commitment of AU member states to advancing energy efficiency initiatives across the electricity, industry, buildings, transport, agriculture and household appliances sub-sectors.

The conference highlighted that Africa’s target set out in the AfEES to increase the continent’s energy productivity by 50 percent by 2050 and 70 percent by 2063 as part of the global pledge to double energy efficiency improvements by 2030.

Speaking at the event, AU Commission Chairperson Mahmoud Ali Youssouf emphasised the deep energy paradox for resource-rich Africa, where 600 million people lack electricity and 900 million still rely on biomass.

Energy efficiency is Africa’s first line of defense against energy poverty, capable of boosting productivity and cutting energy costs, Youssouf said, calling for urgent action to overcome the triple dilemma of energy security, affordability, and regional connectivity.

“Every kilowatt-hour wasted is a school not electrified, a vaccine not safely stored, a business not powered, or a job not created. Energy efficiency is an economic shield, an environmental safeguard, and a strategic pathway to securing Africa’s energy future,” said Chairperson Youssouf.

The chairperson further underscored a unified political will to build a reliable, interconnected, and future-ready energy system for all Africans.

Book & Claim is seen as a key near-term mechanism to overcome infrastructure bottlenecks by enabling greater SAF production in the most efficient locations, the environmental benefits of which can be claimed in locations where SAF production/access is less feasible.","As 2025 draws to a close, Dentons and Energex reflect on a landmark year for the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Europe and what to look out for in the sector going into 2026.

2025 Reflections

Policy: 2025 was a pivotal year for the mandatory SAF compliance market in Europe. The blending targets under the UK SAF Mandate and EU's ReFuelEU came into effect, imposing (for the first time) a minimum 2% SAF blending requirement on aviation fuel suppliers with penalties for failing to meet the mandatory threshold.

Supply and demand: Regulation has therefore clearly boosted SAF demand in 2025. The market has largely been supplied by existing production of HEFA-derived SAF (i.e. first generation biofuels derived from used cooking oils, animal fats and vegetable oils). Notwithstanding this, the UK national average blending was still trending below the 2% requirement and the surging SAF price seen towards the latter half of the year (by more than 50% in recent weeks) signals that suppliers are scrambling to obtain available supply on the spot market to avoid a shortfall against the mandatory requirements.

Ongoing challenges: However, despite the implementation of the SAF blending mandates, announcements of construction of new SAF plants has been sluggish. The perception that HEFA-based SAF will be oversupplied through the rest of the decade may have resulted in delayed procurement. In the short term, this may have proved unwise and will lead to a change of behaviour as obligations mount. In addition, there have been other core challenges faced by SAF producers in securing third-party investment and getting their projects to FID.

Lack of FIDs: Such challenges include the funding of large upfront DevEx costs (often without a clear line of sight on FID), securing long-term offtake arrangements, the price delta between cost of production and the price offtakers/airlines are willing and able to pay (essentially the fossil fuel cost plus a limited green premium) and stable supply of eligible feedstocks. In particular, significant additional investment is needed to ensure increased SAF supply from PtL/e-SAF, noting the e-fuel sub-mandates that will take effect from 2028 in the UK and 2030 in the EU.

First steps government financial support to industry in Europe: The UK government's intention to implement a revenue certainty mechanism to support long-term SAF offtake at a guaranteed price commenced the legislative process with the introduction of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill into the House of Commons in May 2025. A summary of the proposed bill, its legislative readings and key points arising from Parliamentary debates was published in August 2025 and is available here. The Bill is expected to be passed by the end of 2026. The UK's Advanced Fuel Fund also awarded £63 million across 17 SAF projects in 2025 in an effort to assist with high upfront development costs and accelerate SAF production. In the EU, the European Commission published its Sustainable Transport Investment Plan in November 2025 (STIP) which promised increased capital for grant funding for SAF projects and signposted plans to launch an EU-wide double-sided auction for second and third generation SAFs. A summary of proposed measures can be read here. In November 2025, the EU's Innovation Fund also announced €2.9 billion in grant funding to 61 net-zero technology projects. Four of the winning projects are for e-SAF production. Both the UK and EU have therefore shown strong regulatory commitment to the acceleration of SAF production.

Book and claim: The voluntary SAF market also continued to grow alongside the compliance market, with airlines, airports and corporate travellers committing to their own decarbonisation goals, pushing demand in excess of the mandatory requirements. Book and claim models (which decouple the physical fuel from its environmental benefits) emerge on the voluntary market as corporations seek to obtain the environmental attributes of SAF (without purchasing the physical fuel itself). The launch of the IATA SAF Registry was a critical logistical milestone for the industry, providing the essential Book & Claim transparency framework needed for global corporate offtakers and to reduce double-counting risks. Book & Claim is seen as a key near-term mechanism to overcome infrastructure bottlenecks by enabling greater SAF production in the most efficient locations, the environmental benefits of which can be claimed in locations where SAF production/access is less feasible.

2026 Outlook

Project FIDs: To meet mandated 2030 demand targets, an estimated 5.8 Mt of additional capacity must secure Final Investment Decision (FID) in 2026 and 2027. It is essential that the pathfinder projects awarded grant funding the EU and the UK start to take steps towards FID, in order to come online in time for the ramping-up of the blending mandates in 2030. Lack of scalable alternative SAF production by the end of the decade threatens to make the mandates for e-SAF impossible to achieve and add penalty costs to suppliers.

Supply and demand: Expect HEFA to meet market demand for 2026.

Regulatory: The European Commission is required to review and assess the effectiveness of the EU ETS in 2026. It is anticipated that, as part of this review, the EC will extend the allocation of free SAF allowances to continue to support the scale-up of the SAF industry. The UK Revenue Certainty Mechanism will be progressed and we expect advancements to be made on support measures identified in the STIP.

Airlines, suppliers, producers and lenders grapple with new offtake models: Traditional offtake structures which have underpinned the financing of large power and fuels projects previously will be re-moulded to adapt to the market dynamics of the jet fuel supply industry. A certain level of market risk may be borne by projects which will impact on the debt capacity of those projects and ultimately the production cost of SAF.

Technological evolution: Spurred by strong regulatory support and a tightening of feedstock supply for HEFA, expect investment to continue to come into technologies to lower costs to unlock scalable feedstocks such as agricultural waste, forestry residues and municipal solid waste as well as PtL/e-SAF, without which the mandates will be challenging to meet.

A 200 Million USD Agreement

According to the Egyptian government, a contract has been signed with the Qatari conglomerate Al Mana Holding for an initial investment of $200 million dedicated to the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Ain Sokhna, on the Red Sea. This is the first phase of an industrial project that will be rolled out in three stages across a total area of 100,000 m² within the Suez Canal Economic Zone.

A flagship project in Ain Sokhna

The plant will be located in the Sokhna Integrated Zone, with some of the facilities directly connected to the port to facilitate exports. Ultimately, the site will include a 70,000 m² industrial zone and a 30,000 m² port area, making it one of the region’s leading hubs for sustainable fuels.

Green fuel from used cooking oil

The project aims to produce sustainable aviation fuel from used cooking oil, following a circular economy model and promoting waste recovery. The first phase is announced with an annual capacity of approximately 200,000 tons, including SAF (Suez Fuzzy Air), but also co-products such as bio-propane and bio-nafta derived from the refining of these oils.

Egypt positions itself in SAF

This partnership with Al Mana Holding comes as Egypt is multiplying its initiatives to develop a local SAF industry, notably through a first sustainable aviation fuel project in Alexandria led by the Egyptian Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company and using Honeywell UOP technology. The country hopes to thus comply with new international regulations that mandate a gradual increase in the share of sustainable fuels in aviation, while also addressing its CO₂ emissions.

A lever for Egypt-Qatar relations

For Cairo, this investment marks the first Qatari industrial presence in the Suez Canal Economic Zone and symbolizes a new dynamism in the bilateral relationship following the diplomatic reconciliation of the 2017-2021 period.

That single shift sent shockwaves through U.S. markets, exposing how dependent we’ve become on one buyer.
Investing in emerging sectors like sustainable aviation fuel, soy diesel, and other industrial uses can create new, stable markets for U.S. production.
The global commodity export market is evolving at breakneck speed.
If U.S. agricultural policy doesn’t evolve with it, we risk ceding leadership to competitors who are hungry for growth.","For decades, the United States stood as the world’s leading exporter of commodity grains, supported by a diverse base of global buyers. That era is fading. Today, China dominates as the largest purchaser of U.S. soybeans, and while corn exports remain strong, Brazilians have supplanted Americans as those who feed the world.

Brazil’s rise has been remarkable and intentional. The country produces soybeans at yield levels comparable to what U.S. farmers achieved back in 1978, and they’re achieving a similar rate of genetic gain as we do in the U.S. Every year, it adds acres, improves yields, and strengthens its infrastructure. This relentless expansion positions Brazil as a formidable rival in markets where the U.S. once held unquestioned leadership. Much of it is funded by China. According to the Brazil-China Business Council, China has invested more than $66 billion into Brazil since 2014. And that doesn’t include the most ambitious project; the $50 billion Transoceanic Railway. This project would connect Brazil’s massive acreage base with ports in Peru…on the Pacific Ocean side of South America. This would reduce the shipping distance to China by nearly 6,000 miles and completely reroute the world’s shipping lanes.

The vulnerability of our current system became clear when China sharply reduced soybean purchases this past year. That single shift sent shockwaves through U.S. markets, exposing how dependent we’ve become on one buyer. Worse yet, the long-term trend suggests this isn’t a temporary setback—it’s a structural change. If U.S. agriculture continues to rely on the same export-driven model, more farmers will find themselves on the outside looking in as Brazil and other nations seize market share.

The solution is building demand at home. Investing in emerging sectors like sustainable aviation fuel, soy diesel, and other industrial uses can create new, stable markets for U.S. production. These innovations not only diversify demand but also align with sustainability goals that resonate with consumers and policymakers.

Policy reform is equally critical. Farmers need better tools to adapt, such as crop insurance that covers more than just the major crops. Leveling the subsidy playing field would encourage alternative crops and foster resilience in a rapidly changing global economy.

The global commodity export market is evolving at breakneck speed. If U.S. agricultural policy doesn’t evolve with it, we risk ceding leadership to competitors who are hungry for growth. A recent report by the American Bankers Association underscores the urgency: more than 50% of U.S. ag borrowers are projected not to make a profit in 2026. That should be a wake-up call. Further proof, the USDA is set to release $12 billion in payments for “American farmers impacted by unfair market disruptions.” Is it unfair to the buy the cheapest supply or to buy from those you’ve invested in? These payments only further highlight the need for immediate change, as they are unsustainable and will only get larger.

Our system was built for yesterday’s world. If we don’t rebuild it for tomorrow, Brazil—and others—will gladly take our place.",https://seedworld.com/cdn/wp-content/uploads/20251216000253/AdobeStock_298919574-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-16 02:56:25.545256

The investment positions Azzera to expand the capabilities of its digital carbon-management platform, scale its international presence, and roll out new offsetting and sustainability tools for customers.

The partnership was formalised during Dubai Airshow 2025, signalling growing momentum behind technology-led approaches to aviation decarbonisation.

Alongside the equity investment, JETEX has entered into a sustainability partnership with Azzera that will see the private aviation specialist begin procuring and managing sustainable aviation fuel from early 2026.

This collaboration enables JETEX to integrate SAF into its international fleet for the first time, representing a significant shift in its operational strategy as environmental performance becomes a core priority.

Digital tools to unlock SAF adoption

A key element of the agreement sees JETEX acting as a lead partner for Azzera’s new SAF Productivity Operations and Delivery platform. Known as SAF POD, the tool is designed to address administrative and operational barriers that often slow the adoption of SAF across aviation supply chains.

For aircraft operators, SAF POD will be accessible through Azzera’s CELESTE platform, automating the conversion of digital certificates into verified emissions reductions and detailed fuel tracking.

The system also supports the issuance of Scope 1 and Scope 3 certificates, simplifying compliance and reporting requirements for operators managing increasingly complex sustainability obligations.

Azzera says the platform is intended to make SAF sourcing, tracking, and delivery more transparent and scalable, particularly for operators seeking to integrate lower-carbon fuels without adding operational burden.

Embedding sustainability

Beyond fuel management, JETEX will integrate Azzera’s FlyBeyond API into its charter sales ecosystem.

The integration allows real-time carbon offsetting and SAF quotations to be embedded directly into flight quotes, giving operators and customers the ability to make sustainability-led decisions at the point of sale.

According to Azzera chief executive Puja Mahajan, “The investment from and collaboration with JETEX demonstrates our shared vision of a future where sustainability is seamlessly embedded in every flight.”

She added that the partnership helps bridge “the gap between climate ambition and operational reality with practical tools that make sustainability accessible, transparent, and measurable.”

Supporting industry decarbonisation goals

JETEX chief executive Adel Mardini commented that the company views its role in supporting aviation’s climate ambitions as a responsibility, noting that partnering with Azzera aligns innovation with measurable environmental progress.

The collaboration reflects wider industry efforts to combine digital platforms, alternative fuels, and verified carbon markets to drive tangible emissions reductions.

The investment completes Azzera’s $800,000 capital raise, funding further development of its digital sustainability ecosystem.

This includes enhanced emissions tracking, automated compliance processes, and expanded access to high-quality carbon markets through the CELESTE platform, as aviation stakeholders face increasing pressure to demonstrate credible decarbonisation pathways.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/12/15/Jetex-Azzera_L_to_R_Adel_Mardini_CEO_Jetex__Puja_Mahajan_CEO_Azzera-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 02:56:32.671863

SAF is a liquid fuel currently used in commercial aviation which reduces CO2 emissions by up to 80%. It can be produced from a number of sources (feedstock) including waste oil and fats, municipal waste, and non-food crops. It can also be produced synthetically via a process that captures carbon directly from the air. It is “sustainable” because the raw feedstock does not compete with food crops or water supplies, and is not responsible for forest degradation.

Located at 546 Prosperity Drive, Orangeburg, South Carolina, the 20-acre site will convert pine wood residuals from local sawmills into renewable diesel—a clean, drop-in fuel that requires no engine modifications.
The plant will also produce high-value by-products, including biochar and wood vinegar.
“Our goal is simple: bring jobs, innovation, and clean fuel production to South Carolina,” said Robert Bryan, CEO of CRP.

“Our goal is simple: bring jobs, innovation, and clean fuel production to South Carolina,” said Robert Bryan, CEO of CRP. “This project has been years in the making, and Orangeburg is exactly where we want to build.”

Construction begins in spring 2026, with initial modules operating by late 2026 and full operations expected by 2027. State and county leaders praised the project for strengthening South Carolina’s forestry sector, which has faced mill closures and shrinking markets.

The project is supported by county tax incentives and a $755,000 Closing Fund grant from the Coordinating Council for Economic Development and a $200,000 grant from South Carolina's Secretary of Agriculture.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Carolina_Renewable_Products_Logo_e46470445a.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 19:56:50.118102

The country, which has the world’s third-largest aviation market, is aiming to introduce 1% ethanol blending in jet fuel by 2027, raise it to 2% in 2028 and further to 5% by 2030. Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol had shared these targets in Parliament earlier this month.

India has already carried out trial flights using cleaner aviation fuel. In March 2023, Air Vistara, which has since merged with Air India, operated a long-haul Boeing 787 flight from the United States to India using fuel blended. In the same year, Air Asia flew the country’s first commercial domestic flight between Pune and Delhi with a fuel blend.

According to the news report, a long-pending policy on sustainable aviation fuel is likely to be released for public consultations next month, the official said, requesting anonymity.

International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has adopted Carbon Offsetting & Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) as a global market-based measure to reduce emissions from international aviation which require offsetting of emissions above a baseline value. Airlines can either use SAF or offset their emissions by purchasing carbon credits from ICAO approved Emissions Unit Programmes. SAF offers a direct pathway to emission reduction by lowering the lifecycle carbon footprint of aviation fuel. When airlines adopt CORSIA Eligible SAF (CORSIA Eligible Fuel) certified against ICAO’s sustainability standards and verified through Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV), they can claim these reductions as substitutes for carbon credits, thereby decreasing their offsetting obligations under the scheme.

The Centre is supporting biofuel projects through the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, which provides financial assistance for setting up plants, including those producing aviation fuel.

Under the scheme, the government offers interest support for five years, including a one-year repayment break, on loans taken to set up new ethanol distilleries. The support covers interest up to 6% per year or half of the bank’s lending rate, whichever is lower.

Several states, including New York and California have moved to implement climate disclosure requirements over the past several months.
DEC issued draft regulations in March 2025, and received more than 3,000 public comments on the draft in its consultation.
The finalized regulation included a few changes, including extending the verification reporting deadline for the first two years, and reducing reporting requirements from facilities that closed or ceased operations.
Lefton said: “DEC’s greenhouse gas emissions reporting program and subsequent data collection is critical to the State’s ongoing efforts to protect our environment and improve the health and quality of life of all New Yorkers.”","New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) Commissioner Amanda Lefton announced the finalization of new regulations to implement mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions disclosure from carbon-intensive sectors, with reporting slated to begin in 2027.

The new reporting requirements come as the federal government under the Trump administration has pulled back on initiatives to provide transparency into corporate and industrial emissions, including plans to by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) end the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), and moves by the SEC to stop the implementation of its own new climate reporting rules. Several states, including New York and California have moved to implement climate disclosure requirements over the past several months.

Commissioner Lefton said:

“The Reporting Rule will enable DEC to collect the information necessary, despite proposed rollbacks on the federal level, and develop effective strategies that reduce harmful air pollution and direct investments where they are most needed.”

The finalization of DEC’s regulations follows a directive issued by New York Governor Kathy Hochul earlier this year to advance a Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, aimed at providing information on major polluters in the state, informing policies to reduce GHG emissions and to assess compliance with emissions reduction programs, and to help the state meet its emissions reduction goals.

Under the new regulation, facilities included in the new rules will be required to annually provide certain GHG emission data to DEC starting in June 2027, reflecting the previous year’s emissions. In addition, some large emission sources will also be required to verify their emissions data report annually using DEC-accredited third-party verification services.

Entities required to report under the new regulations include owners and operators of facilities in New York that emit 10,000 metric tons of CO2e annually, including electricity generation, stationary combustion, landfills, waste-to-energy, natural gas compressor stations, and other infrastructure; fuel suppliers including natural gas, liquid fuels, and petroleum products, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas, and coal; waste haulers and transporters with estimated emissions from solid wastes transported to landfills or combustion facilities outside of New York exceeding 10,000 MT CO2e in any year; electric power entities; agricultural lime and fertilizer suppliers, and anaerobic digestion and liquid storage of waste at facilities with waste imported to or generated at the facility generating 10,000 MT CO2 per year.

The trade group estimates that SAF production will reach 1.9 million metric tons in 2025, almost double the amount made in 2024. But that figure will fall short of IATA’s initial estimates for the year, and in 2026, growth in production is expected to slow to 2.4 million metric tons.

IATA officials placed the blame on “poorly designed” SAF-related mandates and policy frameworks enacted in the U.K. and Europe.

Europe’s ReFuelEU Aviation, for instance, has sharply increased costs, and airlines are now paying up to five times more for SAF than conventional jet fuel, the group said.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production,” Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general, said in a statement. “Europe’s regulators must recognize that its approach is not working and urgently correct course.”

The trade association said governments should focus their efforts on production incentives, rather than mandates, to increase the global supply of SAF and drive down prices.

SAF is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel made from nonpetroleum feedstocks. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, it can be developed from food and yard waste, woody biomass, agricultural waste, cooking oils, animal fats, and algae.

SAF is a “drop in” fuel, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft engines without requiring modification. Its use can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent.

Many airlines and private aviation companies now use SAF, and some have set targets for a gradual transition away from conventional jet fuel. IATA said that, as a result of increasing costs, airlines that have pledged to use 10 percent SAF by 2030 will be “forced to reevaluate these commitments.”

“SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition,” Walsh said. “These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered.”",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/shutterstock_2030568074.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 16:56:58.683224

Moreover, the slowdown in SAF production growth follows the implementation by the EU and UK this year of new SAF-focused mandates, requiring minimum, and increasing, amounts of SAF usage, causing prices for sustainable aviation fuel to increase sharply.
IATA General Director Willie Walsh said: “If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park.
Walsh also warned that the failure to accelerate SAF production will lead airlines with SAF targets to review their goals, noting that “many airlines that have committed to use 10% SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments.
SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition.” Walsh added:","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced the release of new estimates for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, predicting that output of SAF will reach 1.9 million tonnes (Mt) (2.4 billion liters), nearly doubling the 1 Mt produced in 2024.

While substantially outpacing the prior year’s production, however, the new forecast marks a reduction in the IATA’s estimate for 2025 SAF output from its prior 2 Mt prediction, with the IATA noting that 2025 production will only account for 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption this year, and blaming the downward revision on a “lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities.”

Additionally, the IATA warned that it anticipates that production growth will slow significantly next year, reaching 2.4 Mt in 2026, or 0.8% of jet fuel consumption.

Moreover, the slowdown in SAF production growth follows the implementation by the EU and UK this year of new SAF-focused mandates, requiring minimum, and increasing, amounts of SAF usage, causing prices for sustainable aviation fuel to increase sharply. According to the IATA, SAF prices exceed fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to a factor of five in mandated markets, with the IATA estimating that poorly designed mandates have led to airlines paying a $2.9 billion premium in 2025 for SAF.

IATA General Director Willie Walsh said:

“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonization of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work.”

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels. Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices currently well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels.

Walsh also warned that the failure to accelerate SAF production will lead airlines with SAF targets to review their goals, noting that “many airlines that have committed to use 10% SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition.”

Transcript

We need to increase the production by .01 million tonnes of green hydrogen by electrolysis. And we need around point 10 million tonnes of CO2 coming from the director of capture or from biogenic sources. But now if I put these numbers in comparison of what is the current production in the UK today and maybe you will be a little bit more shocked. So the current UK production of green hydrogen is not point not not 1,000,000 tonnes. So we are an order of magnitude. They're far away from what we need in 20-30 and if we look at CO2 that looks just a little bit worse.

To date, nearly 12,000 companies have set science-based emissions reduction targets with the SBTi, or made commitments to do so.

The organization published its flagship cross-sector Corporate Net-Zero Standard in 2021, and is currently in the process of developing an update to the standard, Corporate Net-Zero Standard V2. The new proposed standard was developed in alignment with the SBTi’s draft Net-Zero Standard V2, while also introducing new methodologies and requirements specific to power sector companies.

One of the key new criteria in the draft standard is a requirement for power sector companies to “publicly disclose a plan to transition away from unabated fossil fuel power generation,” which includes “interim actions to decarbonise, phase-out or retrofit unabated fossil fuel assets, with maximum 5-years milestones up to the net-zero year.” The proposed standard also requires companies to cease investing in new unabated fossil fuel capacity.

The new pilot follows the conclusion of an initial consultation on the draft power sector standard. According to the SBTi, key objectives of the pilot test include ensuring that the new standard and target setting tool are robust, clear and practical, identifying challenges for implementing the standard, informing the development of the final draft of the standard, and testing the feasibility of validating companies against the standard and the clarity of the requirements.

The SBTi said that it is inviting companies across power generation, transmission and distribution, storage, trading, and retail to take part in the new pilot, with applications to participate open until January 16, 2026. Feedback from the consultation and pilot will be used to develop the next draft of the standard

The SBTi said:

“Electricity underpins day to day life and the global economy—from powering homes and industry to enabling digital technologies and innovation. Yet, energy is currently responsible for more than 75% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. As renewable energy deployment accelerates and decarbonization becomes increasingly urgent, the power sector is central to the global transition to net-zero. Establishing a robust, science-based standard is essential for ensuring this transition is both credible and effective.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Electricity-grid.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 10:56:14.973352

With production potential placing Spain among Europe’s leaders, we outline key measures to create a competitive regulatory framework and foster sustainable investment and project development.

How do you see Spain’s biogas and biomethane market evolving in the coming years?

The updated Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (Plan Nacional Integrado de Energía y Clima – PNIEC) targets 20 TWh of biogas and biomethane by 2030. Yet, in 2024, production was only 319 GWh (according to the CNMC), underscoring the need for optimal conditions to attract investment. Although a growth trend is evident, the sector currently meets just 0.163% of Spain’s gas demand. In short, significant expansion is expected, given its early stage and numerous projects under development.

What are the main regulatory or permitting challenges for developers in Spain?

The absence of a dedicated biomethane framework is one of the main current challenges. Regulation remains fragmented and subject to inconsistent regional interpretations, complicating efficient project delivery. Developers must consider raw material proximity, network access, and social opposition, while navigating frequent rule changes on grid capacity and opaque processes for gas network connections. This situation, combined with the conditional injection capacity currently granted to such projects, further limits project appeal.

What measures could make Spain’s biogas and biomethane market more competitive?

Spain is the third country with the highest biogas production potential in the European Union (163 TWh annually), behind Germany and France.

To unlock this potential, Spanish lawmakers could:

(i) grant biomethane projects public utility status;

(ii) grant them preferential demand access capacity to the electricity grid without subjecting them to capacity tenders;

(iii) guarantee injection capacity into natural gas networks by amending current regulations that only allow conditional capacity; and

(iv) create a basic, specific, state-level regulatory framework.

Public authorities should also promote awareness campaigns to increase social acceptance of these projects, while developers should prioritise responsible, safe, sustainable and transparent development.",https://www.addleshawgoddard.com/globalassets/insights/white-with-accent/energy---gas-pipleline---teaser.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 12:57:29.097484

The project marks the first Qatari industrial investment in the Suez Canal zone.

Production is set to start by 2027 under a long-term offtake deal with Shell.

On December 14, on the sidelines of the Egypt–Qatar Business Forum held in Cairo, Egypt signed an agreement with Qatari conglomerate Al Mana Holding for an initial $200 million investment in a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production project. The facility will be located in the integrated Sokhna zone on the Red Sea and represents, according to Egyptian authorities, the first Qatari industrial investment in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE).

The project will be developed by a newly created entity, Saf Fly, and rolled out in three phases. The first phase is expected to deliver annual production capacity of about 200,000 tons, including SAF, biopropane, and bionaphtha, all derived from refined used cooking oil. Al Mana Holding has secured a long-term supply agreement with Shell, which has committed to purchasing the entire output of the facility. Initial deliveries are expected by the end of 2027, providing early visibility on market outlets and reducing commercialization risks.

The agreement forms part of Egypt’s broader strategy to develop low-carbon aviation fuels. On December 4, the country awarded its first SAF production license to the Egyptian Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (ESAF), a subsidiary of the state-owned petrochemical holding company ECHEM, for a separate project in Alexandria.

Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, who attended the signing ceremony, said the initiative with Al Mana Holding reflects the positive momentum in relations between Cairo and Doha. He noted that the project aligns with a shared political commitment to strengthen bilateral cooperation through joint investments and increased trade flows.

Qatar’s return follows the UAE’s historic $35bn Ras El Hekma deal, marking a competitive shift in Gulf capital flow toward the Nile Valley.

Ranked 9th globally for FDI in 2024, Egypt is negotiating the Alam El-Roum coastal project with Qatari Diar to rival Emirati developments.

The rapid thawing of diplomatic relations between Cairo and Doha has crystallized into tangible economic metrics. Official data released during the Egypt-Qatar Investment Forum reveals that bilateral trade volume increased by 80% during the first ten months of 2025, reaching $143 million.

While this volume remains modest in absolute terms relative to Egypt's total trade balance, the trajectory indicates a sharp political pivot. This normalization was cemented by the announcement from Al Mana Holding, a leading Qatari conglomerate, of a $200 million investment to construct a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) plant. This project targets Egypt’s energy sector, leveraging the country's strategic position to supply green fuels to global logistics networks.

Qatar’s economic re-entry must be analyzed against the backdrop of massive regional competition, particularly from the United Arab Emirates. In early 2024, the UAE signed the Ras El Hekma deal, a historic $35 billion acquisition that stabilized the Egyptian pound and catalyzed a 154% increase in FDI inflows to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) region which includes Egypt and Ethiopia among 21 other countries.

In response to this Emirati dominance on Egypt's North Coast, negotiations have advanced regarding the Alam El-Roum peninsula. Reports indicate that Qatari Diar is positioning itself to develop this strategic coastal zone, a move that would signal Doha’s transition from smaller industrial investments to large-scale real estate and tourism infrastructure, directly rivaling the Emirati footprint.

The timing of these investments aligns with Egypt’s improved standing in global capital markets following structural reforms supported by the IMF. According to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and local economic reports, Egypt ranked as the 9th largst recipient of Foreign Direct Investment globally in 2024.

This macroeconomic stabilization has altered the risk profile for Gulf investors. For Qatar, the current strategy is distinct from previous eras of financial aid; it represents a pragmatic pursuit of high-yield assets in a market that has been de-risked by multilateral support and competitor capital.

The selection of Waste-to-X company Boson Energy by NATO DIANA places municipal waste on the strategic agenda. Boson argues that non-recyclable waste can reduce diesel consumption through electrification, cut gas dependence, and produce sustainable aviation fuel –without grid stress. Resulting in a potential to replace some 440 million barrels of diesel per year at fossil-competitive cost and shielded from hybrid threats.

DIANA, Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, NATO’s deeptech accelerator, has invited 150 innovators from 3,688 applicants globally to the 2026 cohort. Boson is one of six ‘Energy & Power Challenge’ companies selected, to focus on resilient, distributed, and secure energy systems for civilian and defence environments – often referred to as ‘dual use’.

“Waste is a profoundly underestimated strategic resource hiding in plain sight”

Boson describes waste as an overlooked domestic energy source. Unlike large-scale renewable production that depends on extensive transmission infrastructure, its Waste-to-X units can operate ‘behind-the-meter’ on compact sites within urban perimeters – right where waste is produced. Boson also points to rapidly growing urban electricity demand from ‘Edge AI’ datacentres that must be located near real-time applications like autonomous vehicles and drones.

Large impact potential

Boson states that the 230+ million tonnes of non-recyclable EU waste by 2035 have the potential, if deployed in transport electrification, to offset all 440 million barrels of diesel consumed annually by EU trucks and buses. Or support production of 40+ million tonnes of SAF– roughly twice the 20–25 Mt EU mandate for 2050. Boson adds that waste heat recovered could replace one quarter of the natural gas used for EU household heating.

“Our technology and solution transform local waste into local energy, sustainable fuels, and even clean drinking water. We can do this at fossil-competitive cost, on attractive commercial terms,” said Jan Grimbrandt, CEO of Boson Energy.

Next, Boson points to the 6 billion tons of legacy waste in Europe’s landfills as an even larger long-term ‘virtual’ resource, representing the equivalent of 11 billion barrels of diesel – roughly four times the recoverable resources of Johan Sverdrup, Western Europe’s largest oil field. Boson also states the potential to at least one billion tonnes of SAF over time. The resulting heat could replace natural gas comparable to 10 times Romania’s new Neptun Deep gas field – the EU’s biggest.

Distributed systems driving local resilience

Boson explains that its standard Waste-to-X unit can convert 100 tonnes of non-recyclable waste per day into 100 MWh of fast charging. That is the daily waste of roughly 100,000 people and can power 300 to 400 trucks or buses without drawing from the grid. The company highlights the environmental benefits of diverting waste from landfills and incineration, integrating carbon capture, and avoiding fossil transport emissions. Clusters processing 300,000 tonnes of waste per year can produce circular hydrogen and CO₂ for up to 50,000 tonnes of SAF annually.

Commercial rollout under way

Boson reports that its core technology has been demonstrated at industrial scale using real municipal waste and that the first commercial projects are under development in France, Poland, Israel, and Australia – together with major waste management and energy companies. Boson works with Siemens AG and other partners to industrialise the solution for rapid rollout. Within DIANA, the company aims to bring understanding across the Alliance for the potential in waste and landfill mining.

Boson CEO Jan Grimbrandt concludes: “The world has a massive, untapped ‘sleeping asset’ in its bins and landfills. DIANA’s selection confirms that distributed generation from local waste has moved from a conceptually appealing idea to a strategic necessity, and we can deliver on that.”

Signed on Thursday at the São Tomé and Príncipe Investment Forum in Brussels, the three agreements will support energy, climate-smart agriculture, and integrated water-energy-food security.
Under the programme, the Government of São Tomé and Principe committed to critical reforms to the public procurement system, customs, and debt management.
The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), administered by the African Development Bank, finances this third phase.
African Development Bank’s Country Manager for Angola and São Tomé and Principe Pietro Toigo said: “As São Tomé and Principe presents to the global community its National Development Plan and approaches investors to power its private sector, these three financing agreements are a clear sign that the African Development Bank stands with the country as a provider of patient capital and risk mitigation”.","The African Development Bank Group and the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe have deepened their development partnership with $18 million in new grant financing.

Signed on Thursday at the São Tomé and Príncipe Investment Forum in Brussels, the three agreements will support energy, climate-smart agriculture, and integrated water-energy-food security.

The first agreement delivers $7.5 million for the third phase of the Fiscal Sustainability and Resilience Program -Supplementary Financing (FSERP-SF) – part of a budget support operation, launched in December 2023. This brings the cumulative value to $20 million to be disbursed directly into the national budget.

The programme drives reforms across two pillars: fiscal sustainability and energy sector transition. Under the programme, the Government of São Tomé and Principe committed to critical reforms to the public procurement system, customs, and debt management.

On energy transition – a top priority in the country’s National Development Plan – the programme finances improved governance of the national utility, tariff adjustments for cost recovery, and an accelerated transition to renewable energy sources.

This policy framework complements investment in energy transformation in generation and distribution infrastructure. The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), administered by the African Development Bank, finances this third phase.

The second financing agreement channels the Global Environment Fund’s (GEF) resources into the Co-Management of Climate Extremes for Agriculture and Fisheries Resilience Project (PRIASA III). The goal is to strengthen agriculture and fisheries value chains while deploying climate-resilient technologies to safeguard livelihoods against droughts, floods, and water scarcity.

With a total investment of $18.9 million, including $10 million in AfDB financing and $8.9 million from GEF, the project will be implemented through three components: enhancing value chains and socio-economic benefits, reducing vulnerability through climate-smart technologies and capacity building, and ensuring effective project management for integrated climate adaptation in agriculture and fisheries.

The third agreement is for a $1.4 million Project Preparation Facility (PPF) for the Water-Energy-Food Security Nexus under the NEW-ERA initiative, to drive sustainable development in the water, energy, and agriculture sectors.

Over two years, the facility will develop critical studies and master plans for integrated water resources management, including a multipurpose dam development, a water treatment plant, climate-resilience measures, and a city-wide sanitation plan.

The PPF lays the groundwork for future investments to deliver universal access to potable water, explore potential hydropower generation, and improve food production by 2030, while strengthening governance and stakeholder capacity. The project will create jobs, enhance ecosystem resilience, and support the country’s climate commitments.

African Development Bank’s Country Manager for Angola and São Tomé and Principe Pietro Toigo said: “As São Tomé and Principe presents to the global community its National Development Plan and approaches investors to power its private sector, these three financing agreements are a clear sign that the African Development Bank stands with the country as a provider of patient capital and risk mitigation”.

The report distributed by the APO Group on behalf of African Development Bank Group (AfDB) stated that as of November 30, 2025, the African Development Bank Group’s active portfolio in São Tomé and Principe totals about $89.4 million, spread across 12 financing instruments, with an average age of 4.2 years and a disbursement ratio of 49.5 per cent. Its sectoral distribution is led by agriculture (43 per cent), followed by multisector operations (23 percent), finance (17 per cent), energy (15 per cent), and water (two per cent).

The Bank’s portfolio reflects a strong emphasis on resilience, food security, energy transition, and macroeconomic reforms, alongside growing engagement in the green and blue economy and financial infrastructure.

Level 1 accreditation recognises airports that have defined their operational boundary and mapped their corresponding emission sources under Scope 12 and Scope 23 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, as well as compiled a latest annual carbon footprint report.

This achievement underscores RSI’s position as a pioneer in sustainable aviation infrastructure and marks the first step on its pathway towards reaching the highest level of accreditation (Level 5[1]) by 2027, in line with global climate goals.

RSI has been conceived from the ground up to set a new benchmark in airport sustainability. Built to LEED Platinum standards, the airport embeds environmental stewardship across design, construction and operations. Its modular pod-based terminal system allows capacity to scale with demand, ensuring that energy consumption remains tightly aligned to passenger flows. By maximising natural light and modular usage, this design approach significantly reduces the overall energy demand when compared with traditional centralised terminal structures.

RSI is also the first airport in Saudi Arabia to supply Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to aircraft, supporting the wider decarbonisation of the aviation sector. Complementing this, the airport is also rolling out all-electric ground service equipment.

To further safeguard the integrity of its surroundings, RSI’s growth is intentionally limited. RSG designed its destinations to accommodate no more than one million visitors a year at The Red Sea, and 500,000 visitors annually to AMAALA, ensuring development remains within environmental thresholds and natural carrying capacity. This measured approach reflects RSI’s role not just as a transport hub, but as a guardian of two of the world’s most pristine destinations.

Together, these measures position RSI as a global benchmark for sustainable airport operations, with Level 1 accreditation confirming its rigorous commitment to measuring, managing and reducing carbon emissions on its journey to net zero on scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2027.

“I think we're living in a tariff world for the indefinite future.” Cutler’s talk focused on the theme “What's Next for U.S.-Japan Trade?” Jill O'Donnell, the Haggart-Work Director of the Yeutter Institute, led the discussion with Cutler.
Through extensive trade negotiations with the United States this year, Japan achieved a reduction to 15% in the U.S. tariff on Japanese auto exports, down from 25%.
Japan also agreed to invest an additional $550 billion in a variety of projects in the United States.
“This could end up really biting the United States because these agreements will have commitments and market opening, but that will be reserved for the participants to the agreements,” she said.","For decades, the United States and Japan have built one of the world’s most successful and stable trade partnerships — a relationship Wendy Cutler says remains vital as the global economy grows uncertain.

Cutler, senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former U.S. trade negotiator who spent nearly 30 years working on U.S./Japan issues, discussed the future of this partnership during a Nov. 19 event sponsored by the Clayton Yeutter Institute of International Trade and Finance.

“We're not going to go back to where we were on trade,” Cutler said. “I think we're living in a tariff world for the indefinite future.”

Cutler’s talk focused on the theme “What's Next for U.S.-Japan Trade?” Jill O'Donnell, the Haggart-Work Director of the Yeutter Institute, led the discussion with Cutler.

Mike Boyle, president of Kawasaki Motors Manufacturing Corp., introduced Cutler after briefing the audience about his company and the extensive market connections linking Japan and the United States. Japan is the No. 1 foreign investor in the U.S. and in 40 states including Nebraska, said Boyle, a Husker alum with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. Japan’s total investment in the U.S. tops $819 billion and employs 968,000 people.

Japan is the No. 1 foreign buyer of Nebraska pork and the No. 2 importer of Nebraska beef and corn. In 2024, Nebraska’s exports to Japan totaled almost $700 million. More than 120 Nebraska companies are actively involved in trade with Japan.

The Kawasaki plant in Lincoln, which marked its 40th anniversary last year, has 3,000 employees making off-road vehicles, railcars, subway cars and large parts for Boeing aircraft. The 2.3 million-square-foot facility is the largest manufacturing plant in Nebraska.

Kawasaki’s Lincoln operations partner with more than 1,200 U.S. suppliers nationwide employing 22,000 people, and in 2024 the plant’s purchases of U.S. parts and services totaled $893 million.

The Lincoln plant also used $517 million in imported parts and materials, and the Trump administration’s stepped-up tariffs this year required the company to pay an additional $170 million in import taxes. The tariff costs have “really been disruptive to our business,” Boyle said.

Cutler said she regularly hears from U.S. companies that are holding off from making investment decisions due to the uncertainties generated by ever-shifting tariff levels. Ironically, American automakers haven’t achieved a significant cost advantage against Japanese competitors, she said, because the Trump administration’s 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum have caused spikes in input costs for U.S. automakers and other domestic manufacturers.

Through extensive trade negotiations with the United States this year, Japan achieved a reduction to 15% in the U.S. tariff on Japanese auto exports, down from 25%. Japan’s agricultural constituency is a powerful political interest that will always push for trade protection, Cutler said, but U.S. agricultural producers will benefit from Japan’s new pledge to buy an extra $8 billion each year of U.S. exports including corn, soybeans, bioethanol and sustainable aviation fuel.

Japan also agreed to invest an additional $550 billion in a variety of projects in the United States. The arrangement is unusual and gives the United States great leverage in decision-making, but Japan’s commitment seems genuine, said Cutler, who served as the assistant U.S. trade representative for Japan, South Korea and the Asia-Pacific area.

If the Supreme Court rules that the administration acted beyond its constitutional powers this year in abruptly imposing tariffs under the 1977 International Economic Emergency Act, the executive branch will have other tariff-imposing tools, but they will be far more slow-moving and procedurally complicated compared to what the world has seen this year, Cutler said.

Just as the U.S. recently lowered tariffs on food items such as coffee and bananas, the administration will likely face pressure to provide additional exclusions on some goods, especially as midterm elections approach in 2026, she said.

The United States’ aggressive and ever-changing approaches on tariffs have given countries “a wake-up call” about U.S. unreliability as a trading partner, Cutler said, and many are pursuing bilaterial and regional trade agreements intended to shift their trade away from the United States.

“This could end up really biting the United States because these agreements will have commitments and market opening, but that will be reserved for the participants to the agreements,” she said. Over the long term, “we could really end up losing out if we don't find a way to integrate our economy more with other countries around the world.”",https://news.unl.edu/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image_teaser/public/media/images/CW0A0256%20E.jpg?itok=F-0Qcu05,N,,2025-12-15 02:56:38.484514

“The ban on internal combustion engines is history,” Weber commented. “We are delivering on our election promise: technological neutrality: combining climate protection with economic success.”

‘Create uncertainty’

Responding, the European Green Party said that it ‘strongly regrets’ reports that the EPP is aiming to weaken the phase-out of petrol and diesel cars, with co-chair Ciarán Cuffe saying that such a move would “create uncertainty, stifle innovation, and weaken Europe’s position in the global race for clean automotive technologies”, ceding leadership in the EV space to China.

“The 2035 zero-emissions standard is a cornerstone of EU climate policy, providing certainty for industry and investors while accelerating the shift to clean mobility,” he said. “The future of mobility is electric. The EU needs a real industrial policy and strategic direction instead of changing strategy every year, so Manfred Weber is acting irresponsibly.”

‘A grave mistake’

Fellow European Green Party co-chair Vula Tsetsi said that weakening or delaying the 2035 phase-out would be a “grave mistake that pushes Europe backwards”, undermining the EU Green Deal, creating uncertainty for industry, and slowing the green transition.

Several car manufacturers, including Volkswagen, Renault, Mercedes-Benz and BMW have called for the planned ban to be dropped, noting that consumers are not adopting EVs at the levels anticipated when the 2035 deadline was approved three years ago.

It’s how we stay connected with family, expand business opportunities and take holidays to relax. This makes scaling the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—along with other technological developments such as battery-powered planes—critical if we want to continue flying while trying to stop climate change. Without it, we risk significantly reducing, or even losing, our freedom to connect. First-generation biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester or FAME) producers who have the feedstock, capability and resources to switch to SAF production may hold the fate of air travel in their hands.

A Growing Market for SAF

Although SAF currently represents less than 1% of the overall jet fuel market, several countries including Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Turkey and Brazil will introduce SAF mandates from 2026 or 2027. This will add to existing commitments from the United Kingdom and European Union. Meanwhile, several more countries are considering the introduction of SAF targets in the coming years. With growing global demand, supportive policy regimes and a significantly underserved market, now is the time for interested biodiesel producers to make the switch before feedstocks become difficult to secure.

With global SAF demand expected to rise 10-fold from 2024 to 2030, supply pressure on feedstock is already becoming apparent. For example, in late 2024, the Intercontinental Exchange launched a dedicated used cooking oil futures contract in response to rising demand, creating the opportunity for participants to better manage their price exposure.

Securing Long-Term Feedstock Contracts

When considering an investment in the construction of a SAF plant, one of the major constraints is the availability of feedstock on a long-term supply contract. Consequentially, existing biodiesel producers with contracts in place that can be diverted to make SAF start from a place of advantage.

The need for long-term contracts is further underscored by the changes we can expect to see in feedstock import and export volumes. Around 90% of the U.K.’s SAF is currently produced using imported cooking oil from China. However, with China’s plans to introduce its own SAF targets, some producers will need to begin sourcing alternate feedstocks closer to home. Altogether, having feedstock contracts locked in early in the project development process is essential for managing risk and optimizing project returns.

Financial Incentives Set to Expand

One of the key benefits of moving from biodiesel to SAF production within the next couple of years is the attractive financial incentives currently on offer, particularly in the U.S. market. On top of the RIN credits that both biodiesel and SAF collect through the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, SAF also attracts up to $1 per gallon credit through the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit scheme. State credits can also pay up to an additional $1-$2 per gallon for SAF. This brings total incentives for SAF to up to $3.50 per gallon more than biodiesel.

While in Europe there are no dedicated financial incentives yet, changes on the near horizon look promising. For example, there is a proposal to introduce a stronger price signal for SAF production through the Energy Taxation Directive, which would provide a tax exemption. The European Commission is also expected to release a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan later this year, in which industry bodies such as ACI Europe have called upon to allocate specific EU funds to develop SAF production facilities.

Although SAF plants are currently more expensive to build than an equivalent capacity biodiesel plant, incentive regimes, along with the premium price levied on SAF, make for attractive project returns. For most U.S. projects, the typical payback period has fallen to under three years, creating a compelling case for investment.

Technology Choice Significantly Impacts Project Economics

For biodiesel producers considering converting their facilities, a preliminary techno-economic assessment will estimate the cost of construction, the volume of SAF that will be produced, operational costs such as utilities and financial incentives available. Reusing auxiliary existing infrastructure from the biodiesel plant, such as housing, pretreatment systems and tankage, can reduce product costs by 20%-30%.

Currently, eight technology pathways exist to manufacture SAF, but the HEFA pathway (i.e. hydrotreating fats, oils and greases) offers the industry’s fastest payback and lowest total cost of production while producing comparable yields. This is made possible by the latest innovations which move away from traditional trickle-bed design, as well as opting for a modular build.

For example, Sulzer’s BioFlux technology is a two-stage liquid full hydrotreating process that first removes the oxygen from the oil and then isomerizes it so that the hydrocarbons resemble jet fuel. Rather than using a conventional trickle bed reactor design which is prone to hot spots, BioFlux uses a liquid full reactor design where the catalyst bed is completely submerged in liquid feed with hydrogen dissolved using a proprietary internals design, leading to homogeneous mixing. This significantly improves the efficiency and efficacy of the reaction, optimizes the volume of hydrogen needed and extends the life of the catalyst. In addition, the process has less equipment, so it is simpler to maintain and more reliable. For example, the traditional method requires gas compressors for recycling the vapor; instead, BioFlux eliminates the vapor recycle loop and gas compressors and uses pumps to move the effluent.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Cont1_BDM_1_26_8f5259cd8e.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 01:56:30.832273

Johari was responding to a supplementary question from Senator Che Alias Hamid on how the government plans to ensure a stable supply of raw materials to support the growing SAF industry.

Addressing concerns over feedstock availability, Johari said the government would move to halt exports of used cooking oil to safeguard domestic supply and would adopt a circular economy approach within plantation activities to ensure long-term sustainability of raw materials.

In a separate explanation, the minister said the government has also introduced a range of measures to attract both local and foreign investment into the SAF sector. These include streamlining approval processes for plant construction licences, production licences and export permits.

“The government will continue to assist and facilitate industry players interested in operating in Malaysia.

“These measures send a clear signal of the government’s full support for investors seeking to enter the SAF industry,” he said.

The announcement, confirmed by Egypt’s cabinet, marks the first Qatari industrial investment inside the zone and reflects growing economic cooperation between Cairo and Doha.

According to the government statement, the SAF facility will span 100,000 square metres within the Integrated Sokhna Zone on the Red Sea coast and will be developed in three phases. The first phase will produce an estimated 200,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel annually, placing Egypt among a growing group of countries investing in cleaner energy for global aviation.

The deal comes as Egypt continues its push for large‑scale foreign investment to help manage heavy external debts and a widening budget deficit. Gulf states, including Qatar, have become key partners in this strategy.

Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said the agreement reflects “positive momentum” in relations between the two countries, citing shared political will to deepen joint investment and trade after years of turbulent ties. Diplomatic relations were restored in 2021 following the end of the 2017–2021 regional rift.

The new SAF project follows Qatar’s recent announcement of a $29.7 billion luxury real estate and tourism investment on Egypt’s Mediterranean coast, the largest Qatari commitment in Egypt since relations normalised.

Regional Significance and Energy Context

The move aligns with broader global trends as nations race to create cleaner aviation fuels capable of easing pressure on climate commitments. The Suez Canal Economic Zone has positioned itself as a manufacturing and logistics hub for renewable energy, green hydrogen, and industrial projects with export potential.

The project also arrives at a time when energy markets are shifting rapidly. Gulf investors have increased strategic acquisitions across Africa and the Mediterranean to secure long‑term economic influence and diversify beyond oil.

TVOA Insight

Africa’s partnerships in energy and technology are becoming more strategic, and Egypt’s deal demonstrates how nations on the continent are positioning themselves inside a changing global economy. Africa is young, still building, and cannot be compared to economies with centuries of head starts. What matters is momentum, and deals like this show that African countries are not waiting for permission to enter industries of the future. With the right investment climate, youth talent, and cross‑regional cooperation, the continent’s emerging markets can shape cleaner aviation, sustainable industries, and new economic pathways that reflect Africa’s long‑term potential.

District cooling is more efficient than conventional chiller systems, which are unlikely to be operating at optimal efficiency at all times as cooling demand of a building fluctuates.
For instance, during peak periods, the Marina Bay district cooling system melts stored ice to provide cooling.
Moreover, the implementation of urban planning policies that take district cooling into consideration can lead the way for greater adoption.
SP Group’s vision District cooling was once unheard of in Singapore, and an uncharted territory for SP Group.","SP Group aims to address the region’s rising cooling needs with the more energy-efficient district cooling system.

Southeast Asia, like the rest of the world, continues to heat up. Rising in tandem is the high demand for cooling in its major cities and beyond. According to the United Nations, global air-conditioning use is expected to triple by 2050.

Aside from exacerbating the region’s dependence on energy, air-conditioners release heat into the environment to increase temperatures further. This contributes to greater pressure on power grids to remain reliable during peak periods.

In this interview with Asian Power, Stanley Huang, Group CEO of SP Group, Singapore’s national grid operator and a leading sustainable energy solutions provider in Asia Pacific, noted the need for more efficient and sustainable forms of cooling to meet the growing demand.

When cooling demand tests grid reliability

Think of a giant air-conditioner that can cool an entire district, rather than just individual buildings, in a more energy-efficient way. This is district cooling, a system that centralises chilled water production for cooling before piping the water to multiple buildings for air-conditioning. It can provide a respite, and more.

District cooling is more efficient than conventional chiller systems, which are unlikely to be operating at optimal efficiency at all times as cooling demand of a building fluctuates. Instead, a district cooling system is expected to operate closer to its optimal efficiency level most of the time as it will accurately select the most suitable mix of chillers to meet the aggregated cooling demand of multiple buildings. One example is the world’s largest underground district cooling network at Singapore’s Marina Bay operated by SP Group.

“The network has scaled smoothly over the years to serve more buildings and larger cooling loads without compromising performance. It has become a reliable backbone for Singapore’s downtown core, with zero disruptions since operations began in 2006,” said Huang.

District cooling systems can also incorporate technologies like an ice thermal energy storage system to reduce pressure on power grids during high cooling demand. For instance, during peak periods, the Marina Bay district cooling system melts stored ice to provide cooling. This approach relieves grid stress without compromising cooling comfort.

“The system has more than proven its engineering and operational robustness,” added Huang. “Today, it remains a testbed for innovations in energy-efficient cooling and grid integration in Singapore and across the region.”

This solution comes at a time when national grids are increasingly working overtime to keep us comfortable. The International Energy Agency recorded that about a third of Southeast Asia’s electricity demand growth is attributed to cooling. Space cooling is also the fastest-growing source of energy demand in buildings, increasing by nearly 4% annually to 2035.

A greener way to cool cities, industries

District cooling has the potential to be a mainstay in decarbonising the Asia Pacific’s built environment and meeting organisational or even national net-zero targets.

Take the example of Singapore’s largest industrial district cooling plant at global semiconductor firm STMicroelectronics’ (ST) Ang Mo Kio TechnoPark. It is expected to reduce 120,000 tonnes of carbon emissions a year at ST’s single largest wafer-fabrication site by volume – a boost for the company’s commitment to be carbon neutral by 2027.

But for district cooling to enjoy uptake across the region, governments and industries must work together on clear national sustainability strategies to reduce regulatory complexities and encourage investment through green financing models. Moreover, the implementation of urban planning policies that take district cooling into consideration can lead the way for greater adoption.

An example of this is Singapore, which introduced incentives for buildings that join a district cooling network. These buildings can either exclude spaces used by their chiller plants connected to a district cooling system from the development’s gross floor area use or remove their old chillers to repurpose that space for commercial use. Several buildings in Tampines Central, Singapore’s first town centre to be retrofitted with a distributed district cooling network, are already on board.

SP Group’s vision

District cooling was once unheard of in Singapore, and an uncharted territory for SP Group. But 20 years on, it stands as a prime example of Singapore’s ability to innovate and scale sustainable infrastructure.

SP Group has taken these learnings beyond Singapore to deploy sustainable cooling solutions in China, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Today, SP Group is using its extensive experience to help cities and industries in the Asia Pacific transition to energy-efficient cooling – from a government complex in Bangkok, Thailand, to commercial mixed-use developments in Western China.

Competition, protectionism, and the road ahead While Fifth Freedom rights enhance efficiency, they also trigger competitive concerns.","The Chicago Convention and associated Freedoms of the Air, particularly the Fifth Freedom, remain central to modern airfreight, enabling multi-leg routes that optimise payloads, reduce empty backhauls, and support high-value intercontinental trade flows.

Fifth Freedom rights serve as both an economic tool and diplomatic lever, with liberal jurisdictions promoting them to enhance connectivity, while others limit access to protect domestic carriers, affecting trade patterns and competitive dynamics.

Maximising their value requires streamlined approvals, robust transhipment infrastructure, and alignment with sustainability goals, ensuring that network efficiencies support growing global cargo demand while meeting environmental and regulatory standards.

Eighty years after its signing, the 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation, known as the Chicago Convention, continues to underpin the governance of international air transport. Created in the final phase of the Second World War to restore order to civil aviation, it established a core principle: every state exercises full sovereignty over its airspace. Yet, to make international aviation viable, states also needed to grant limited operating rights to one another. This balance between sovereignty and mobility produced the “Freedoms of the Air”, which remain central to commercial aviation.

As airfreight becomes increasingly important to global trade, these same freedoms now influence which cities rise as logistics hubs, which airlines expand, and how supply chains are structured. Recent examples, including China Eastern Airlines’ Fifth-Freedom service linking China to Budapest via Riyadh, highlight how these rights operate in practice and why they matter to the next phase of airfreight growth.

Chicago’s enduring architecture

Signed by 52 nations in 1944 and now comprising 193 contracting states, the Convention established a regime that combines national sovereignty with structured cooperation under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Two core instruments emerged:

• the Convention itself, which established ICAO and set regulatory standards; and

• the International Air Services Transit Agreement (IASTA), which created the First and Second Freedoms—the right to overfly and to make technical stops.

The commercial freedoms, including the Third, Fourth, and Fifth, were left to bilateral agreements. These determine whether an airline may carry revenue traffic between foreign states. Passenger airlines have generally used them sparingly, but cargo carriers have converted them into strategic assets.

The significance of the Fifth Freedom

The Fifth Freedom—the right for an airline to carry traffic between two foreign countries on a service that originates or ends in its home country—has become fundamental for cargo networks. It enables carriers to blend markets, improve aircraft utilisation, and create commercially viable long-haul routings.

A carrier operating a Shanghai–Riyadh–Budapest rotation, for example, can move Chinese exports to the Middle East before transporting Middle Eastern shipments to Europe. This maximises payloads, reduces empty backhauls, and forms new trade corridors not served by direct home-country flights.

IATA’s 2024 Air Cargo Market Analysis shows global demand rising 10.6 percent year-on-year, driven primarily by intercontinental flows. Multi-leg routings—many enabled by Fifth-Freedom permissions—account for a growing share of capacity, particularly between Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Sectors such as pharmaceuticals, electronics, and perishables rely heavily on these routings, where delays of even one day risk undermining product value.

Economic tool and diplomatic lever

Despite strong commercial logic, Fifth Freedom rights remain politically sensitive. States evaluate traffic rights through the lens of national interest, balancing trade facilitation with the protection of domestic airlines. Air-service agreements govern these decisions, defining capacity, routes, designated carriers, and the scope of permitted freedoms.

In practice, Fifth Freedom operations require agreement from three states: the airline’s home country, the intermediate stop, and the final destination. Liberal jurisdictions such as Singapore, the UAE, and the Netherlands promote these rights to strengthen trade and logistics connectivity. Others, such as India and China, grant them selectively to safeguard national carriers.

As ICAO observes, these permissions function as “instruments of economic diplomacy”, requiring states to weigh sovereignty against broader connectivity gains.

Network economics and competitive models

Fifth Freedom rights reshape the economics of freighter deployment by enabling multi-point routing that balances demand across multiple legs. Aircraft such as the Boeing 777F and Airbus A350F operate more efficiently when integrated into circuits linking Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.

This model parallels the development of Sixth Freedom hub operations, such as those in the Gulf region, where carriers consolidate traffic from numerous origins and redistribute it globally. The “networkisation” of air logistics—connecting manufacturing centres, consumption markets, and transhipment hubs—is built on the flexibility provided by these freedoms.

Policy priorities for airfreight

To modernise the system without altering the Convention’s structure, three policy priorities stand out:

Streamlining traffic-rights approvals

Fifth Freedom applications often face administrative delays. Standardised approval processes would improve responsiveness in a sector that moves nearly 35 percent of global trade by value.

Enhancing transhipment infrastructure

Liberal rights must be matched by adequate physical capability. Airports such as Dubai’s DWC, Singapore’s Changi Airfreight Centre, and Luxembourg Findel Airport demonstrate the value of integrating cold chain, bonded logistics, and digital customs systems.

Aligning with sustainability mandates

Under ICAO’s CORSIA and IATA’s Net Zero 2050 roadmap, growth in Fifth-Freedom operations must align with sustainable aviation fuel uptake and operational efficiencies.

Competition, protectionism, and the road ahead

While Fifth Freedom rights enhance efficiency, they also trigger competitive concerns. The European Union incorporates fair-competition provisions in agreements to prevent market distortion, while the United States grants open-skies rights selectively. Developing economies must balance liberalisation with domestic industry growth. India’s restrictive Fifth-Freedom policies, for example, have limited transhipment potential at major airports despite national ambitions for cargo expansion.

As airfreight becomes integral to global economic infrastructure, the principles set out in 1944 remain relevant. Yet uneven liberalisation and infrastructure disparities risk fragmenting the global cargo network. The future lies not in rewriting the Convention, but in harmonised, data-driven frameworks reflecting twenty-first-century trade realities.

The Fifth Freedom, once an abstract diplomatic concept, has become a competitive differentiator and a catalyst for supply chain resilience—making freedom of the air increasingly synonymous with freedom to trade.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Page-5-shutterstock_1627386802.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 01:58:46.608333

Manulife has a history of stable earnings and continues to report favorable earnings in its core lines of business, despite some fluctuations year to year, said AM Best in a December 2025 assessment.

“The company’s earnings are reflective of its diverse business model, which includes a robust insurance and wealth & asset management product offering, geographic diversification throughout Asia, Canada and the United States and a strong market presence, with [Manulife] holding leading market positions in its core lines of business,” AM Best wrote in its assessment, where it affirmed the insurer’s A+ (Superior) financial strength rating.

The company has also taken steps over the past several years to derisk its book of business by reinsuring billions of low return-on-equity and non-core business lines, particularly long-term care insurance, it added.

Manulife’s ERM program is judged as “very strong” by AM Best.

These strengths are offset by Manulife’s remaining exposure to its non-core business lines, including long-term care and universal life with secondary guarantees.

Manulife does have prudent management of these blocks of business through loss prevention initiatives, policy conversion programs, reinsurance and conservative reserving practices, AM Best said.

“Whilst the alternative long-duration asset portfolio has exhibited some volatility, it has demonstrated a favorable historical track record and generally has enhanced Manulife’s investment yield whilst providing investment diversity,” it wrote.

We will have created a booming market for “green” fuel that isn’t truly green.
Even with an all-out effort, SAF production will be constrained for decades.","DECEMBER 15 — The future of flying is already here. It’s called Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). It’s being hailed as the magic bullet that will allow us to keep our wanderlust without cooking the planet.

A new comprehensive review by Klimczyk, Jasiński, Niklas, and Siedlecki cuts through the hype with precision, revealing a simple, uncomfortable truth: SAF is indeed the only viable path to decarbonising aviation in the near-term, but the journey to making it truly sustainable is far more complex and perilous than we’ve been led to believe.

The authors clearly lay out the menu of production pathways. We have the established workhorses, like HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), which can turn used cooking oil into jet fuel today. It’s the low-hanging fruit.

Then we have the promising but pricey future: alcohol-to-jet, gasification of agricultural residues, and the holy grail — power-to-liquid (PtL) or e-fuels, synthesised from captured carbon and green hydrogen. And herein lies the first critical insight: There is no single “best” SAF. The right choice is entirely contextual, a delicate and location-specific calculus of feedstock availability, energy input, and ultimate environmental payoff.

This is where the study’s focus on Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) becomes paramount, delivering its most potent dose of reality.

The “sustainable” in SAF is not a given; it must be earned. The core promise of SAF is its potential for near-carbon-neutral flight, as the CO2 released when it burns is roughly equal to the CO2 absorbed by its biomass feedstocks during growth.

But LCA forces us to look at the entire picture: the emissions from farming, fertilising, harvesting, transporting, and processing. It’s a full accounting, and the devil is in the details.

The review exposes the critical trade-offs. Do we use a waste feedstock like forestry residues, which has minimal land-use impact, or do we cultivate dedicated energy crops that might be more efficient but could compete with food production or drive deforestation?

This “indirect land-use change” (ILUC) is the ghost in the many well-intentioned biofuels. A fuel that looks clean on paper can be responsible for a carbon bomb if it indirectly causes a rainforest to be cleared elsewhere.

This brings us to the crux of the argument: Our current obsession with a single number — the percentage blend of SAF — is dangerously myopic. The EU’s ReFuelEU mandate and the US Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are powerful drivers, but if they focus only on volume and not on quality, they risk creating a monster.

We could hit our 10 per cent SAF target by 2030, but if that fuel is primarily made from questionable feedstocks with high ILUC values, we may have solved a political problem while exacerbating an ecological one. We will have created a booming market for “green” fuel that isn’t truly green.

This is where the authors’ discussion of certification frameworks becomes vital. Systems like CORSIA and the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive II are the arbiters of truth, the ones tasked with defining the rulebook for what counts as “sustainable.”

The review suggests that while these frameworks are a necessary starting point, they are not yet sufficient. They must be strengthened to fully account for ILUC, water usage, and social impacts with unflinching rigour. A weak certification is a greenwashing enabler.

So, where does this leave us? The work of Klimczyk et al. is not a obituary for SAF, but crucial for its responsible deployment. We must prioritise the right pathways. While HEFA gets us started, we cannot be lulled into complacency.

The real endgame must be the scaling of advanced biofuels from true residues, and a massive, global push to bring down the cost of power-to-liquid fuels. This requires a Manhattan Project-level investment in electrolyser and direct air capture technology. Policy must reward carbon intensity, not just volume.

A litre of SAF should be valued based on its actual, certified lifecycle emissions. This would create a market pull for the best fuels, not just the cheapest ones. We must be honest about limits. Even with an all-out effort, SAF production will be constrained for decades. It cannot be the only solution. It must be paired with radical efficiency gains in aircraft and operations, and a sober conversation about the necessity of some air travel.

SAF is not a get-out-of-jail-free card. It is a bridge to a future of truly clean aviation. The comprehensive review is the essential blueprint. It tells us the bridge is possible, but it also shows us where the foundations are weak and the design is flawed. Our job is to build it right, lest it collapses under the weight of our expectations.

India has already conducted test flights with sustainable fuel. Air Vistara, now merged with Air India, operated a transatlantic test flight of a Boeing 787 from the US to India using 28% blended fuel in March 2023. Air Asia operated the first commercial domestic flight (Pune to Delhi) with 0.75% blended fuel the same year.

A much-awaited policy for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will likely be released for stakeholder consultations next month, the official cited above said on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, a top industry executive said installed production capacity of ethanol exceeds demand by 4.22 billion litres currently, which is enough to meet the initial target for SAF.

In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) introduced the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) scheme to limit aviation emissions to 85% of 2019 levels, requiring decarbonisation initiatives by carriers globally.

India, a member of ICAO, has to comply with mandatory phases of carbon offsetting in aviation from 2027.

The international aviation entity recognises 11 pathways to switch to green jet kerosene, and ethanol made from byproducts of sugar are carbon neutral, said Deepak Ballani, the director general of the Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers’ Association (ISMA), a leading industry body.

“SAF based on ethanol had the least carbon intensity, according to studies done in partnership with organisations such as Deloitte (consulting firm) and The Energy Research Institute (TERI). The government is drawing insights from these studies,” Ballani said.

The government is working in collaboration with organisations, such as ISMA, on preparing a biofuels programme and road map. Distilleries have conducted several trials to supply ethanol for low-carbon jet kerosene and the government is likely to announce a policy for sustainable aviation fuel by next month, the official quoted above said.

In July, India achieved the target of mixing 20% ethanol — an alcohol compound extracted from sugarcane molasses and grains — with petrol, a move towards paring oil imports.

“India has an inherent advantage in producing ethanol due to its unique ecosystem that binds farmers and millers in historic partnerships,” Ballani said. However, there will be some challenges in rolling out SAF, unlike E20, because it will require trilateral partnerships between distilleries, oil marketing companies and airlines, he said.

The Centre is implementing the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN (Jaiv Indhan - Vatavaran Anukool fasal awashesh Nivaran) Yojana, offering financial aid for biofuel plants, including for sustainable aviation fuel. Over 30 new distilleries have been set up by ethanol producers on the back of these incentives.

The SCZone has attracted around $13 billion in foreign investment over the past three years, including $4.2 billion in the past year alone and $4 billion over the past five and a half months.
The project aims to transform the area into a coastal tourism and investment hub, with the first phase scheduled to begin in 2026.
Investment and Foreign Trade Minister Hassan El-Khatib said Egypt’s economy is “moving in the right direction” under its International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed reform programme.","Egyptian officials said the forum aims to deepen joint manufacturing projects and strengthen supply and value chains in industries, including aluminium, automotive manufacturing, textiles, glass, and polyester, combining Egyptian production capacity with Qatari capital and investment expertise.

Trade between Egypt and Qatar rose by nearly 80 percent, from $80 million in 2023 to $143 million in the first 10 months of 2025, driven largely by recent Qatari investments, including large-scale North Coast developments launched in November.

The project aims to transform the area into a coastal tourism and investment hub, with the first phase scheduled to begin in 2026.

Egyptian officials say the project is expected to generate more than 250,000 jobs and include residential, tourism, and leisure developments, as well as power distribution facilities, water desalination and treatment plants, hospitals, schools, universities, and administrative infrastructure.

General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) chief Hossam Heiba said foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to Egypt have risen, with investment rates growing by about 25 percent over the past year and company capital increasing by 70 to 80 percent over the same period.

Officials attributed the increase to economic reforms aimed at stabilizing macroeconomic policy, expanding private-sector participation, and digitizing government services.

Investment and Foreign Trade Minister Hassan El-Khatib said Egypt’s economy is “moving in the right direction” under its International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed reform programme. The IMF has previously said Egypt’s economic indicators improved faster than expected following recent policy measures, praising progress on investment and trade reforms during its latest review missions under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) programmes.

The goal: lower fuel burn, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and help airlines save money at a time of rising costs and mounting climate pressure.
Airbus has already completed several successful test flights in partnership with Air France, Delta Air Lines, French bee, and Virgin Atlantic.
If applied to commercial operations, Airbus estimates that this technique could reduce fuel consumption by up to 5% on long-haul flights.
According to a study by the environmental group Transport & Environment (T&E), the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—which emits less CO₂ over its lifecycle—will continue to grow.","Airbus is experimenting with a flight formation inspired by nature in an effort to cut fuel consumption and reduce aviation’s environmental footprint. The concept borrows directly from how birds fly in groups, using airflow dynamics to improve efficiency—much like the slipstream effect seen in Formula 1 racing.

The European aerospace giant is behind the initiative, known as Fello’fly, a project designed to optimize flight routes by taking advantage of aerodynamic lift created by aircraft flying ahead. The goal: lower fuel burn, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and help airlines save money at a time of rising costs and mounting climate pressure.

How the Fello’fly concept works

The idea is simple in theory but complex in execution. Two aircraft fly in a coordinated formation similar to migrating geese. One plane leads, generating wake turbulence that creates a slight upward lift. The aircraft behind can then “ride” that airflow, improving fuel efficiency through a phenomenon known as wake energy recovery.

Airbus has already completed several successful test flights in partnership with Air France, Delta Air Lines, French bee, and Virgin Atlantic. These trials focused on validating whether such formations could be flown safely, precisely, and within existing aviation regulations.

Successful tests over the North Atlantic

According to French business outlet BFM Business, Airbus carried out eight test flights over the North Atlantic between September and October 2025. The objective was to prove the operational feasibility of guiding two aircraft to a precise rendezvous point while maintaining vertical separation, as required by air traffic control rules.

If applied to commercial operations, Airbus estimates that this technique could reduce fuel consumption by up to 5% on long-haul flights. That reduction would translate directly into lower CO₂ emissions—a meaningful gain for an industry under intense scrutiny.

Why fuel savings alone won’t solve aviation’s climate problem

While innovations like Fello’fly can help, their overall impact remains limited. Several structural challenges continue to slow progress toward more sustainable air travel.

The high cost of cleaner fuels, a shortage of new aircraft, and the relentless growth in global air traffic all work against deeper emissions cuts. Passenger numbers keep climbing year after year, putting added pressure on airlines and the environment.

A future with more passengers—and more planes

Airbus forecasts that global air travel will reach 8 billion passengers by 2040, nearly double the 4.5 billion recorded in 2019. Meeting that demand will significantly expand the world’s aircraft fleet over the next two decades.

According to a study by the environmental group Transport & Environment (T&E), the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—which emits less CO₂ over its lifecycle—will continue to grow. However, the study warns that even if SAF accounts for 42% of fuel use, as required under European regulations, the aviation sector would still burn as much fossil kerosene in 2049 as it did in 2023.

The worldwide movement toward cleaner energy sources is gaining momentum, fundamentally changing how institutional investors approach their portfolios. As the push for decarbonization intersects with rapid technological progress and evolving regulations, a new category of assets is emerging—offering both environmental benefits and financial stability. A key driver of this change is the creation of sophisticated market infrastructure, such as RESurety’s CleanTrade platform, which has received CFTC approval. This platform is enhancing transparency, liquidity, and risk management in the clean energy derivatives space. For institutional investors, these advancements open up fresh possibilities to diversify holdings and meet ESG objectives, especially in an era of modest returns.

Building the Backbone of Clean Energy Markets

Robust infrastructure is the cornerstone of thriving, liquid clean energy markets. In 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Technology Commercialization allocated over $35 million to support 42 projects through the CLIMR Lab Call, aiming to bridge the gap between laboratory breakthroughs and commercial-scale deployment. At the same time, private companies are making strides in essential technologies: Helion Energy’s Orion fusion facility in Washington is set to deliver 50 MW to Microsoft’s data centers, while TAE Technologies is making plasma formation more cost-effective and less complex, advancing the promise of fusion energy. Progress in hydrogen infrastructure is also notable, with Southwest Research Institute leading projects to test high-pressure valves and underground storage solutions. Collectively, these initiatives are overcoming long-standing challenges in scalability and reliability, paving the way for greater institutional investment.

CleanTrade: Driving Market Liquidity and Openness

At the center of this market transformation is RESurety’s CleanTrade platform, which gained CFTC approval as a Swap Execution Facility (SEF) in September 2025. By offering a regulated environment for trading Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs), Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), and Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), CleanTrade has resolved persistent inefficiencies in clean energy derivatives. Within just two months of its debut, the platform saw $16 billion in notional trading volume, reflecting strong institutional trust in ESG-focused assets. Enhanced by real-time analytics, carbon tracking, and robust risk management features, CleanTrade meets the rigorous standards of institutional investors.

Beyond streamlining transactions, CleanTrade is transforming the investment landscape by standardizing contracts and introducing transparent price discovery. This reduces the information gaps that have historically deterred clean energy investment. The platform’s ability to hedge against renewable energy price swings through structured derivatives gives investors greater confidence—a crucial advantage as energy markets are increasingly shaped by policy changes and technological innovation.

Portfolio Diversification and Risk Control in a Low-Yield World

The emergence of liquid clean energy markets coincides with a broader trend among institutions to seek alternative assets. According to a 2025 U.S. report, private equity, hedge funds, and infrastructure have become central to institutional portfolios as investors search for returns in a low-interest-rate climate. Clean energy derivatives, made accessible through platforms like CleanTrade, offer a valuable addition to these strategies. They provide access to rapidly growing sectors such as hydrogen and fusion, while also enabling cross-asset hedging to manage systemic risks.

Incorporating ESG considerations is now a mainstream priority for institutional investors. Assets that support decarbonization are increasingly favored, and CleanTrade’s transparent carbon tracking ensures compliance with evolving regulations. For example, the platform’s verification of renewable energy production and carbon offset credits enables investors to achieve Scope 2 targets under the SEC’s climate disclosure requirements. This dual emphasis on financial returns and environmental responsibility strengthens portfolio resilience, especially as markets contend with the long-term effects of climate change.

Looking Ahead: The Next Era of Clean Energy Investment

As innovation, regulatory clarity, and institutional interest converge, liquid clean energy markets are poised to become a foundational element of future investment portfolios. The U.S. clean energy lending sector, which expanded by 7.6% in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year, highlights the sector’s growth potential. Meanwhile, advancements in long-duration energy storage by companies like Form Energy and the development of sustainable aviation fuel infrastructure by Twelve Energy are broadening the applications for clean energy assets.

For investors, seizing this opportunity means leveraging platforms like CleanTrade to access structured, liquid, and ESG-compliant investments. As the energy transition accelerates, those who incorporate these assets into their diversification strategies will not only protect themselves from traditional market risks but also position themselves at the forefront of a transformative economic era.",https://img.bgstatic.com/video/open_graph_new.png,N,,2025-12-14 14:57:04.703475

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Airbus Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple way to connect your view of the Airbus story to the numbers by turning your assumptions about future revenue, earnings and margins into a financial forecast and a Fair Value estimate. On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors use Narratives as an accessible tool to spell out their thesis, link it to a forecast, and then compare their Fair Value to today’s share price to decide whether Airbus looks like a buy, hold, or sell. Because Narratives update dynamically when fresh news, earnings, guidance or industry data comes in, your thesis evolves as the facts change rather than staying frozen in time. For example, one investor might build a Narrative that leans on the most bullish analyst targets, strong backlog growth and smooth production ramp ups, leading to a higher Fair Value than the current price, while another might focus on supply chain risks, slower margin expansion and the lowest analyst targets, producing a much lower Fair Value and a more cautious stance.

In an interview, he stressed that the country should not be concerned about the active development of the sector, citing Ireland as an example, where increased competition from Ryanair helped make air travel more affordable and contributed to broader economic growth.

Walsh noted that infrastructure expansion should be approached in a comprehensive manner, encompassing visa facilitation, the development of tourism, the hospitality and transport sectors, as well as the creation of competitive conditions and the conclusion of “open skies” agreements.

The head of IATA emphasized that the integration of all these elements would make it possible to fully stimulate growth in the air transport market.

Walsh also separately commented on initiatives to develop the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Central Asia. He underscored the importance of increasing production volumes in order to reduce costs and urged governments to consider all possible feedstock sources rather than limiting themselves to a single option.

Walsh noted that any investment in SAF is welcome, stressing that initiatives undertaken by regional governments create new business opportunities and stimulate economic growth. He underlined the importance of a comprehensive approach to industry development, including the use of various types of feedstock and the search for new sources to expand production capacity.

Such an approach, he said, would enable countries in the region to fully harness the potential of SAF, reduce production costs, and enhance the investment attractiveness of the aviation sector.

It is worth recalling that Allied Biofuels FE LLC Uzbekistan has signed an agreement with the government of the Khorezm region concerning land and water resources for the implementation of a project to build a bioprocessing complex in the Tuproqqalinsky district. The total investment in the project is estimated at US$5.9 billion.

The project предусматривает the establishment of Central Asia’s first fully integrated zero-emissions aviation fuel production facility. Once operational, the plant is expected to produce annually 382,000 tonnes of SAF, 152,000 tonnes of electro-synthetic e-SAF, and 11,000 tonnes of green diesel, based on 2 GW PEM electrolyzers.

India is poised to become a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) export hub, leveraging its significant ethanol surplus and lower carbon intensity compared to rivals. With potential SAF plants operational by 2029, India aims to supply Southeast Asia and the Middle East, capitalizing on its competitive advantages in ethanol production.

India is positioning itself as a potential export hub for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), leveraging surplus ethanol capacity and lower carbon intensity compared to rivals like Brazil, according to Sameer Sinha, CEO (Sugar Business) of Triveni Engineering and Industries Ltd.

However, Sinha stressed the need for price adjustments. ""If my input prices increase, there has to be a corresponding increase in the output price. Otherwise, it becomes very unviable.""

Triveni was among pioneers in setting up multi-feed distilleries, enabling flexible feedstock conversion between sugary feedstocks like cane syrup B or C heavy molasses and grains such as maize and rice.

""That has helped us maximise utilisation of our distillation assets,"" Sinha said.

The company has secured approximately 80 per cent of its contracts with public sector and private oil marketing companies for ESY 25-26, and expects to reach 100 per cent capacity utilisation once the second cycle of ethanol tenders is announced.

Sinha believes India should leverage initiatives like the Global Biofuels Alliance to showcase its leadership in biofuels, with SAF ideally positioned for this role.

""The country being a signatory to Corsia, and we believe that used cooking oil with a very fragmented supply chain in an unorganised sector will not be in a position to take India beyond one, two, three per cent numbers. Therefore, when the 5 per cent target comes into force 2030 onwards, we believe ethanol to jet would really be the right pathway,"" he said.

At the global level, used cooking oil is being used for making SAF, especially in Europe and China, while others are looking at ethanol. The first SAF plant has been commercialised at Atlanta in the US.

""One of the differentiating factors of ethanol to jet is the benefit it brings to farmers in terms of rural prosperity, it enhances the farmer's income,"" Sinha said, highlighting socio-economic benefits beyond environmental gains.

A continent that hosts 18 percent of the world’s population accounts for barely 3 percent of global air passenger traffic.

Even more telling, three quarters of international passenger traffic into Africa is carried not by African airlines but by foreign carriers. This imbalance is not simply a market curiosity but a sign of deeper structural challenges.

Air transport is anything but a luxury. It is a lifeline for landlocked nations, a catalyst for tourism, a conduit for trade, and a bridge across a geography where road, rail, and marine infrastructure are often fragmented or underdeveloped. In short, aviation is a strategic enabler of integration and growth.

Yet African carriers continue to limp from year to year with margins so thin they barely amount to commercial viability. The latest financial outlook from the International Air Transport Association (Iata) underscores this reality.

It projects that African carriers will earn only $0.2 billion in profit in 2025 and 2026. This translates into net margins of 1.1 percent in 2025 and 1.0 percent in 2026—the lowest of any region worldwide.

Profit per passenger tells an even starker story: $1.40 in 2025 and $1.30 in 2026, compared with a global average of $7.90. African airlines are carrying more passengers, yet earning far too little from each seat.

This weakness is particularly troubling because underlying demand is robust. Passenger traffic is expected to grow by 6 percent in 2026, well above the global forecast of 4.4 percent. But capacity growth lags at 5.7 percent, constrained by older fleets, high financing costs, and limited liquidity. Africa is participating in the global aviation recovery, but without the financial stamina needed to sustain long-term growth.

The causes are structural. Africa has the highest operating costs of any aviation market globally, with cost per available tonne-kilometre nearly double the global average.

Fuel—already a major cost everywhere—is up to 20 percent more expensive in Africa due to taxes, storage fees, weak supply competition, and logistical inefficiencies. Ageing aircraft consume more fuel and require more maintenance, further inflating operating costs.

Read: African airlines brace for another year of thin margins as old challenges persist

Market fragmentation, reinforced by restrictive bilateral agreements and inconsistent visa regimes, suppresses intra-African travel and keeps airfares high in price-sensitive economies.

Taxes and charges, averaging 28 percent, compound the problem. These levies push ticket prices beyond the reach of ordinary travellers and erode airline margins.

Rising labour costs, airport fees, and the growing expense of sustainable aviation fuel add new pressures. Supply chain delays slow fleet renewal, leaving African airlines with some of the oldest aircraft in the global industry even as competitors modernise. Without deliberate action, they remain exposed to every shock — from fuel volatility to geopolitical disruption.

A reset is essential. Unless there is a decisive review of aviation taxes, charges, and the broader cost of doing business, Africa’s airlines will remain trapped in a cycle of underperformance. Governments must reassess aviation taxes, and liberalise market access to unlock meaningful economies of scale.

Accelerating open skies policy, modernising fleets through targeted incentives, and abandoning restrictive bilaterals would all reduce operating costs and stimulate traffic.

Only then can African airlines transition from survival mode to sustainable profitability—and provide the connectivity on which the continent’s future depends.",https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/resource/image/5296708/landscape_ratio3x2/1200/800/24670b5ec01e08ad6297a1fc0d54e5f0/XC/plane-1-.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 00:56:22.153936

The parties believe that the partnership has the potential to advance HEFA and next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF pathways

The parties intend to jointly evaluate the future development of New Rise Louisiana, a SAF facility comparable in size to XCF’s New Rise Reno facility of ~40 million gallons

XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq:SAFX); Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (“Southern”); and DevvStream Corp. (“DevvStream”) (Nasdaq:DEVS) (together “the parties”) today announced a non-binding tripartite memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) to jointly explore the potential development of a next-generation low-carbon fuels platform designed to accelerate SAF adoption, expand domestic capacity, and integrate environmental-attribute monetization into a unified customer offering.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, while global demand is expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, supporting a global market of more than $25 billion. By that time, approximately 4 billion people are expected to live in countries that utilize SAF for air transportation. Looking ahead to 2050, the global SAF market could exceed $250 billion. This collaboration is intended to position the parties around a unified platform that directly supports this long-term growth.

The collaboration would seek to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways while advancing the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes. As part of the negotiation of a binding agreement, the parties expect to evaluate the commercial viability of developing a HEFA-based SAF facility in Louisiana.

Potential Unified Commercial Platform and Strategic Integration

The parties intend to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement which, if executed, would create a collaborative venture that intends to develop a unified commercial platform that enables customers to procure fuel, logistics services, and environmental-attribute value through a single integrated offering. If developed, this structure would be expected to simplify procurement, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance long-term customer retention across the aviation and industrial markets.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, said:

“This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform – linking production, logistics, and environmental-attribute systems into a seamless value chain. If we succeed in combining Southern’s developmental stage biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology, DevvStream’s environmental-attribute and digital MRV capabilities, and XCF’s HEFA production and commercial infrastructure, we see the potential to build a revolutionary end-to-end system that unlocks new value for customers and potentially accelerate the scaling of SAF in a disciplined, capital-efficient way.

“Our goal is to modernize how low-carbon fuels are produced, certified, and delivered – not as isolated components, but as an integrated solution aligned with the needs of global aviation and corporate sustainability programs.”

Potential Environmental-Attribute Monetization and Digital Infrastructure

A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform’s low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (“LCA”) methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream, said:

“Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment. This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths – XCF’s production expertise, Southern’s developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream’s environmental-asset monetization capabilities – to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.”

Potential Multi-Pathway SAF Collaboration and Offtake Framework

The parties intend to explore a long-term offtake framework under which XCF could purchase SAF which will eventually be produced by Southern, subject to mutual agreement on commercial terms, in order to capitalize on long-term global demand for SAF.

A key anchor for the potential collaboration is Southern’s planned biomass-to-fuel facility in Louisiana, expected to produce approximately 28 million gallons of SAF and 220 kilotons of methanol per year, supported by an estimated $1.4 billion total project investment, according to Southern.

The parties further intend to explore multiple SAF production pathways with the goal of accelerating the adoption of SAF worldwide to address the forecasted industry demand noted above, including:

Southern’s in-development, next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF platform;

XCF’s HEFA-based SAF platform; and

Joint carbon-intensity and co-product optimization strategies

Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern, added:

“We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit. We are eager to work together to further develop our experimental $SAF token on Solana with DevvStream. Further, we believe Louisiana has the workforce, infrastructure, and feedstock resources to become a national leader in low-carbon fuels, and we see this potential collaboration as a major step toward that future.”

Exploration of New Rise Louisiana SAF Facility

The parties plan to assess the potential development of New Rise Louisiana, a proposed HEFA SAF facility. The evaluation process is expected to include engineering, permitting, feedstock integration, logistics, and financing strategies.

XCF and Southern also plan to evaluate municipal financing pathways in Louisiana, following recent momentum from the Louisiana Community Development Authority, which authorized up to $402 million in potential revenue bonds for Southern’s biomass-to-fuel project, subject to additional approvals, documentation, and market conditions. While not representing committed capital and there can be no assurance that any such bonds will ultimately be issued or that any particular amount of funding will be available, the authorization underscores Louisiana’s growing role as a U.S. clean-energy manufacturing hub. Any XCF participation in Louisiana municipal financing strategies would be separate from and in addition to Southern’s existing authorization. There can be no assurance that XCF will be able to secure any Louisiana municipal financing.

Cooper added:

“We believe Louisiana offers a compelling combination of infrastructure, talent, and policy support. We expect our evaluation of New Rise Louisiana will allow us to determine whether our modular HEFA platform can complement Southern’s developing biomass capabilities while fitting squarely within our disciplined, capital-efficient growth model.”

The MOU reflects a shared intent to collaborate on SAF and other low-carbon fuel opportunities. Any specific offtake arrangements, investments, or project development activities described in this release remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, internal corporate approvals, and any required regulatory or permitting approvals. Accordingly, the MOU does not commit any party to proceed with any particular transaction or project.
