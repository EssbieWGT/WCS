This initiative allows airlines and SAF suppliers to engage in discussions to negotiate specific terms, such as pricing, upon a successful match.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA's SVP Sustainability and Chief Economist, says: ""To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF.""

By simplifying SAF procurement and enhancing the visibility of available options, the platform encourages further development of the SAF market.

Detailed information regarding SAF, such as volumes and feedstock, alongside emissions data and compliance certifications, is available for participants to make informed decisions.

""The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,"" said Marie.

The platform is hosted on IATA's Aviation Energy Hub, providing a centralised digital space with practical tools for aviation energy management.

SAF's growing importance

Sustainable aviation fuel is increasingly recognised as a vital element in reducing emissions within the aviation sector.

According to IATA, SAF could account for up to 65% of the needed reductions to achieve net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050.

To illustrate the growing importance of SAF, a major partnership has been formed between FedEx and Neste, a leading SAF producer.

This collaboration marks a significant step in sustainable transportation, with FedEx committing to a substantial supply chain development at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/17477459e70148fee359a7646383fbb5:82ccb0b059b40266e8abe3714defff38/planes-runway.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-17 13:20:12.505898

During a media roundtable in Singapore, IATA’s Director General, Willie Walsh, warned that Europe’s strategy is missing its primary goal: reducing the aviation sector’s carbon footprint.

SAF Transport: More Emissions, Not Less

Walsh criticized the current SAF supply model in Europe. “The idea of purchasing sustainable fuel and transporting it for use in Europe is not the right approach,” he stated. “You’re clearly increasing that fuel’s carbon footprint due to transportation costs.”

Global SAF production currently represents only a fraction of airlines’ total fuel consumption. According to IATA estimates from June, production is expected to reach 2 million metric tons by 2025—just 0.7% of the sector’s total fuel demand.

→ IATA Launches Platform to Connect Airlines and Sustainable Aviation Fuel Suppliers

Sky-High Costs, Invisible Benefits

The EU’s mandatory approach has triggered a concerning side effect: rising prices for conventional fuel. “Mandating the use of a product that isn’t available delivers no environmental benefit,” Walsh argued.

He also noted that oil companies required to produce SAF are passing those costs onto traditional fuel prices. According to IATA, the prices being charged “far exceed the actual cost of the limited SAF supply.”

“The EU has effectively enabled monopolistic suppliers to raise prices without delivering environmental benefits,” Walsh added, urging European authorities to reassess their current SAF targets.

2030 Target: Realistic or Utopian?

The EU mandate, established under the ReFuelEU Aviation program, requires airlines to blend 6% SAF into their fuel mix for flights by 2030. While subsidies exist to support SAF purchases, market conditions remain challenging.

Asia Gains Ground in SAF Production

As Europe struggles to meet its own demand, Asia is making steady progress. This year, at least five SAF projects—outside China—have begun operations or are ready to start production, with plans for regional exports and shipments to Europe. Singapore is emerging as a key supplier of “green fuel” to the European market.

The Palm Oil Debate

Walsh also addressed a growing controversy: the use of palm oil as a feedstock for SAF production. “You could argue there’s sustainable palm oil and unsustainable palm oil, but in some parts of the world, the approach is too black and white,” he explained.

The executive emphasized the need for a more “nuanced” approach and a detailed assessment of the sustainability of inputs used in SAF production.",https://aviacionaldia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/combustible-sostenible-de-aviacion.jpg,N,,2025-07-17 13:20:21.273925

While these levels exceed those provided under the 2018 farm bill, they primarily reflect the redirection of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding into the permanent farm bill baseline rather than new program expansions.
The bill also renews smaller initiatives that were not funded in the last farm bill extension.
One Big Beautiful Bill Act – Conclusion and What’s Next Farmers and ranchers face uncertainty from every direction — markets, weather, input costs and regulation.
At the same time, H.R.1 is not a complete substitute for a full farm bill reauthorization.","H.R.1 improves the ARC program by increasing the revenue guarantee from 86% to 90% and raising the maximum payment from 10% to 12% of benchmark revenue starting with the 2025 crop year. These changes will help farmers better recover from revenue losses due to price drops or yield declines. Additionally, for the 2025 crop year only, farmers will automatically receive the higher of ARC-CO or PLC payments for each covered commodity — without needing to make an election.

OBBB makes significant updates to base acres — the land tied to farm program payments. For the first time in over a decade, USDA will allow up to 30 million new base acres to be allocated to farms that have historically produced program crops but don’t currently have base acres. Eligibility is based on planting history from 2019–2023. Farmers won’t have to give up existing base to qualify, and allocations are proportionally tied to past plantings. These new base acres can make producers eligible for future PLC or ARC payments starting in 2026.

For dairy producers, the bill enhances the DMC program by increasing Tier I coverage eligibility from 5 million to 6 million pounds per farm. Farms can also use the highest production year from 2021 to 2023 as a new enrollment baseline. Those who commit to multiyear DMC coverage receive a 25% discount on premiums, encouraging long-term participation.

H.R.1 extends marketing assistance loan programs through 2031 and sets updated loan rates for major commodities beginning in the 2026 crop year, providing stronger price floors for crops like wheat, corn, cotton and soybeans. The bill also resumes cotton storage payments, enhances repayment flexibility based on world market prices, and ensures refunds for upland cotton producers when repayment prices exceed market lows, helping farmers manage risk and improve cash flow.

The bill modernizes how farm entities are treated under USDA program rules. It ensures that pass-through entities like partnerships, LLCs and S corporations are treated equitably when it comes to payment eligibility and attribution. The annual commodity payment limit is increased from $125,000 to $155,000, with future adjustments tied to inflation. Additionally, farmers who earn at least 75% of their income from farming, ranching or related activities such as agritourism and direct marketing may be exempt from income-based program eligibility limits. These changes recognize the diverse structure of modern farm operations and help ensure that program support reaches actively engaged producers.

Finally, the bill also includes targeted updates for specific commodity sectors. Economic adjustment assistance for domestic textile mills is enhanced by increasing the payment rate for upland cotton used in textile manufacturing from 3 cents to 5 cents per pound starting in 2025. In the sugar program, the loan rate for raw cane sugar is increased to 24 cents per pound for the 2025 through 2031 crop years, with refined beet sugar rates set proportionally higher. Minimum storage payment rates for forfeited sugar are also updated, and USDA is directed to modernize beet sugar allotment rules and improve the timing of quota reallocations. Additionally, the bill requires a USDA study on potential safeguards for refined sugar imports to protect the domestic sugar industry, with authority to issue new regulations based on the study’s findings.

Crop Insurance:

Crop insurance remains a cornerstone of the farm safety net, and the bill makes several significant updates to strengthen and modernize the program through 2031. It increases premium support for beginning farmers and ranchers by expanding USDA’s definition from five to 10 years of experience, enabling more producers to qualify for assistance over a longer period. Premium assistance is increased during the first four years: an additional 5 percentage points in years one and two, 3 points in year three, and 1 point in year four. These increases are layered on top of the existing 10 percentage point subsidy, resulting in a total subsidy of 15% for the first two years, 13% in year three, 11% in year four, and 10% from year five through year 10.

The bill authorizes a new pilot insurance product for contract poultry growers, helping them manage production risks tied to utility cost volatility and extreme weather — such as spikes in natural gas, propane, electricity or water costs. The program must be developed in collaboration with stakeholders and launched in top poultry-producing states.

It also expands eligibility for the Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO), allowing producers enrolled in ARC to purchase SCO coverage, which was previously only available to those enrolled in PLC. This change offers greater flexibility in tailoring risk management strategies.

To improve affordability and coverage for all producers, the bill increases the government's share of crop insurance premiums by 3 to 5 percentage points across all farmer-selected coverage levels (Figure 3), making higher coverage more affordable. The maximum coverage level for area-based insurance plans is also increased to 95%, and the premium subsidy for those plans is raised from 65% to 80%.

Additionally, funding for compliance and integrity oversight is increased to $10 million per year, and administrative reimbursements are restructured to better reflect the cost of delivering the program in high-risk areas. Together, these updates aim to ensure continued access to affordable, flexible and accountable crop insurance options that help farmers manage both market and weather-related risks.

Conservation Programs: The bill continues long-term funding authority for USDA’s major conservation programs, including the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) through fiscal year 2031. While these levels exceed those provided under the 2018 farm bill, they primarily reflect the redirection of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding into the permanent farm bill baseline rather than new program expansions. These updates are reflected in amendments to Section 1241(a) of the Food Security Act of 1985, which establish higher annual funding levels than those provided under the 2018 farm bill.

Although this shift reinforces long-term baseline investments in working lands conservation, the bill does not retain all IRA-funded initiatives. For example, it rescinds $450 million in unobligated IRA funds that had been allocated for competitive forestry grants to non-federal landowners. According to the Congressional Budget Office, these adjustments collectively result in a net reduction of $1.8 billion in conservation spending over the next decade.

The bill also renews smaller initiatives that were not funded in the last farm bill extension. This includes the Grassroots Source Water Protection program, which safeguards well water, and the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive program, which rewards farmers for opening land to hunting and recreation. In addition, the Feral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program, a vital initiative to combat over $1.6 billion in annual damages caused by invasive wild pigs, is extended with new funding through 2031.

Trade Promotion: An earlier draft of H.R.1 would have increased funding for USDA’s core trade promotion programs — including the Market Access Program (MAP), Foreign Market Development (FMD), Emerging Markets Program and Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops through 2031. However, due to jurisdictional constraints in the reconciliation process, the final bill instead establishes a new Agricultural Trade Promotion and Facilitation Program that mirrors the purpose of MAP and FMD. Starting in fiscal year 2027, this new program provides $285 million in permanent mandatory funding each year, significantly enhancing USDA’s ability to support international market development. Because existing MAP and FMD authorities remain unchanged at $200 million and $34.5 million, respectively (subject to annual appropriations), this new program represents an increase in trade promotion funding capacity — particularly through a stable baseline mechanism.

Research and Innovation: H.R.1 maintains support for key USDA research initiatives and provides targeted funding to advance agricultural innovation. The bill increases funding for the Specialty Crop Research Initiative to $175 million in fiscal year 2026 — more than doubling current levels — to enhance research on pest control, crop breeding and mechanization for high-value crops. It also invests $60 million in scholarship support for students at 1890 land-grant universities, which serve historically Black institutions with agricultural programs. To modernize aging research infrastructure, the bill provides $125 million in mandatory annual funding starting in 2026 for competitive grants under the Research Facilities Act. The legislation also extends funding through 2031 for USDA’s Urban, Indoor, and Emerging Agriculture Initiative, provides $8 million to support assistive technology for farmers with disabilities, and allocates $37 million to the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research to promote public-private innovation partnerships. These investments aim to strengthen the nation’s agricultural research capacity through improved facilities, expanded access and science-based approaches to production challenges.

Rural Development, Forestry and Schools: While H.R.1 contains forestry and rural development provisions, it does not include a reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program. This omission reflects the Senate’s decision to handle SRS separately through the Secure Rural Schools Authorization Act of 2025, which passed the Senate chamber in June. A companion bill has been introduced in the House, but it has not yet advanced. Continued funding for SRS remains critical for counties with large areas of federally owned forestland, particularly in the West, where local tax bases are constrained.

Energy Programs:

The final bill includes a limited extension of USDA’s farm energy programming. Specifically, it reauthorizes the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels through 2031, which provides payments to producers of renewable fuels like biodiesel, cellulosic ethanol and other next-generation biofuels. While the House-passed bill also proposed extending the Biobased Markets Program (BioPreferred), which promotes biobased (plant-derived) products through federal procurement and labeling, that provision was not included in the final legislation.

Specialty Crops, Horticulture and Organics: The final bill delivers tailored support for specialty crop producers (fruit, vegetable, nut and nursery crop farmers) and the organic sector. It increases funding for the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program, providing $85 million annually through 2025 and $100 million in 2026. It also boosts the Plant Pest and Disease Management and Disaster Prevention Program from $75 million to $90 million in 2026 to help growers combat invasive threats like citrus greening and the spotted lanternfly. For organic agriculture, the bill reauthorizes organic market data collection with $10 million through 2031, provides $5 million in 2026 to modernize systems for tracking organic imports, extends cost-share assistance for organic certification through 2031 and includes $5 million for USDA’s pesticide use survey in 2026.

Disaster Assistance: Section 10401 of the final bill makes several key updates to USDA’s Supplemental Agricultural Disaster Assistance programs, improving both payment levels and eligibility criteria across a range of livestock and specialty operations. For livestock producers, the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) is revised to provide 100% of market value for animals lost to predation and 75% compensation for animals lost to adverse weather or disease. The Agriculture Secretary is also authorized to account for regionally documented price premiums above national averages when determining livestock value, offering more equitable support for producers in higher-value markets. Additionally, the bill creates a new payment mechanism for unborn livestock losses occurring after Jan. 1, 2024. These payments, triggered when losses exceed normal mortality, are tied to species-specific multipliers and set at no more than 85% of the payment rate for the lightest weight class of the animal.

The Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP) is also expanded to improve access and payment levels. Instead of requiring eight consecutive weeks of qualifying drought, the revised program provides one month of assistance after just four consecutive weeks of qualifying conditions and allows for a second month if drought extends to seven of the previous eight weeks. The Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Fish (ELAP) program is amended to include payments for farm-raised fish losses due to bird depredation, with a minimum payment rate of $600 per acre and consideration for revenue loss, deterrent costs and disease-related mortality. The bill also directs USDA to use a standardized 15% normal mortality rate when determining eligibility for honeybee colony loss payments.

Finally, the Tree Assistance Program (TAP) is strengthened by eliminating outdated references to adjusted mortality thresholds. The cost-share rate for tree replacement is increased from 50 to 65%, and losses are now evaluated based on normal damage or mortality without reductions for presumed baseline losses. Collectively, these updates provide more accurate and timely assistance for agricultural producers facing production losses from natural disasters, animal predation and disease pressures.

Miscellaneous and Livestock Provisions: H.R.1 addresses a grab-bag of important programs that don’t neatly fit into a farm bill title but matter on the ground. A major highlight is animal agriculture health: the bill injects significant new funding into the three-pronged National Animal Disease Preparedness, Detection and Vaccine Bank programs. Starting in 2026, USDA must spend $233 million per year on animal disease prevention and response, a seven-fold increase over previous levels. This means more resources to stockpile vaccines, bolster veterinary diagnostics and train state responders – a timely investment to protect livestock farmers from devastating outbreaks. This increases resources to counter significant threats like foot-and-mouth disease, highly pathogenic avian influenza and screwworm. As poultry producers in multiple states have learned the hard way, an outbreak of avian influenza can decimate flocks overnight. Similarly, a single case of foot-and-mouth disease in U.S. livestock could halt billions in exports. Starting in 2031, annual funding continues at $75 million, with a focus on sustaining preparedness infrastructure.

The bill also directs USDA to conduct a mandatory biennial cost survey of dairy processors to assess the actual manufacturing costs of converting raw milk into cheese, butter and nonfat dry milk — products used to set Class III and IV milk prices under the Federal Milk Marketing Orders. Developed with direct input from Farm Bureau, this provision ensures that future make allowance updates are based on consistent, up-to-date data, a long-standing request from dairy farmers seeking fairer and more transparent pricing formulas.

It also expands funding for the Sheep Production and Marketing Grant Program through 2026 to support innovation and marketing efforts in the sheep and lamb industry.

Several previously expired or “orphaned” programs are revived and funded through 2031, including the Pima Cotton Trust Fund and Wool Apparel Manufacturing Trust Fund, which assist U.S. textile manufacturers, as well as the wool research and promotion program. The bill also extends the Emergency Citrus Disease Research and Extension Program — focused on combatting huanglongbing (citrus greening) — through 2031, providing researchers with sustained funding to develop long-term solutions to protect citrus groves in Florida and other key growing regions.

Nutrition Title: Alongside farm programs, H.R.1 also reauthorizes nutrition assistance, chiefly the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), with reforms aimed at balancing continued support for vulnerable families with efforts to reduce fraud and program inefficiencies. The bill extends SNAP and related nutrition programs through 2031, while updating work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, modifying utility allowance rules, and introducing targeted program integrity reforms. Continued funding is also provided for food banks through The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP).

According to the Congressional Budget Office, these changes result in an estimated $186 billion in SNAP-related savings over the next decade. As illustrated in Figure 4, the bulk of these savings stem from adjustments to the Thrifty Food Plan reevaluation, work requirement modifications, utility allowance limits and administrative cost-sharing reforms. These savings played a central role in offsetting increased farm program outlays, enabling Congress to reinvest in the farm safety net, rural development and agricultural infrastructure without increasing total agricultural spending under the bill.

Tax Provisions Benefiting Farmers, Ranchers and Rural Businesses (Title VII): H.R.1 also delivers major tax relief and incentives that can directly impact farm and ranch families. These include:

Permanency of 2017 Individual Tax Code Provisions: Nearly 98% of farms and ranches operate as sole proprietorships, partnerships or S corporations and did not benefit from the permanent tax relief granted to corporations in 2017. H.R. 1 grants permanency to numerous tax provisions important to families and farms in Title XI, Part 1, preventing their tax rates from increasing if they had been left to expire at the end of 2025. These provisions include expanded tax brackets with a lower maximum tax rate, increased standard deductions of $15,750 and child tax credits of $2,200 per child and increased thresholds for alternative minimum tax (AMT) liability.

Qualified Business Income Deduction (Section 199A): For pass-through entities, H.R.1 makes permanent the 20% qualified business income deduction introduced in 2017. The final bill makes permanent the 20% deduction while also providing a minimum deduction of $400 for any business with $1,000 or more in qualified business income. This lowers the share of farming profits spent on taxes and is a big win for small businesses nationwide that compete alongside corporations with lower tax rates.

Estate Tax Relief for Family Farms: H.R.1 makes the estate tax exemption permanent at $15 million per individual (or $30 million per couple), indexed for inflation. Without this change, the exemption was set to drop back to $5.5 million after 2025, a level that’s wildly out of step with today’s farm economy. With skyrocketing land values, equipment costs and input prices, even modest-sized farms can easily exceed that threshold, meaning upon the owner’s death, far more family operations would face massive tax bills than previously estimated. By locking in a higher, inflation-adjusted exemption, the bill helps ensure more family farms can transition smoothly to the next generation without being forced to sell off land or assets to pay the IRS.

Enhanced Business Expensing and Depreciation:The act raises Section 179 small business expensing limits to $2.5 million (up from about $1.29 million), with a higher phase-out threshold of $4 million. In addition, H.R. 1 permanently restores full bonus depreciation for capital investments, canceling the remaining phase-down of this expensing benefit. While full bonus depreciation will not retroactively apply to the last two years of phase-down, it will be active for anything purchased in 2025, even if purchased before the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Practically, these provisions mean farmers can continue to write off the entire cost of new equipment, land improvements like drainage tile, modernized barns and other essential capital upgrades in the year of purchase, rather than depreciating them over many years.

Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z): H.R.1 delivers a significant win for agriculture-linked, domestic renewable fuels by extending and modifying the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) through 2029. The credit supports the production of low-emission transportation fuels — including ethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — by offering a tax credit tied to lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reductions. To qualify, eligible fuels must be produced by American-controlled firms using feedstocks from the U.S., Mexico or Canada. These changes support a broad range of agricultural feedstocks such as corn, soybeans and other biomass-based materials, expanding markets for farmers while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The act also amended Sections 45Z and 6426(k) to ensure makers of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) do not receive overlapping tax credits, and increased credits for small biodiesel producers. Combined, the changes to 45Z reinforce domestic and regional production capacity, strengthen supply chain security, and encourage investment in U.S. agriculture and biofuel infrastructure. Extending this credit provides long-term certainty and sends a clear market signal that incentivizes cleaner fuels, agricultural innovation and rural economic development.

One Big Beautiful Bill Act – Conclusion and What’s Next

Farmers and ranchers face uncertainty from every direction — markets, weather, input costs and regulation. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act delivers long-overdue policy certainty by strengthening core safety net programs, enhancing risk management tools and locking in important tax provisions for family farms. It reflects many of Farm Bureau’s top priorities and offers measurable wins for producers navigating an increasingly complex farm economy.

At the same time, H.R.1 is not a complete substitute for a full farm bill reauthorization. Crafted through the reconciliation process, the bill was shaped by budget and jurisdictional limits that excluded several important areas of farm and rural policy.

""This is what innovation looks like—fast, flexible, and focused on making SAF production affordable.""","Syzygy Plasmonics is rewriting the rules of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production with a first-of-its-kind commercial project in Uruguay—now supported by Fischer-Tropsch technology leader Velocys. The NovaSAF 1 facility will convert dairy waste and biogas into drop-in jet fuel with a nameplate capacity of 500,000 gallons annually, using only renewable electricity and waste gas—no green hydrogen, no complex gasification.

At the heart of the project is Syzygy's light-driven GHG e-Reforming technology, which produces the ideal 2:1 syngas ratio for Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis directly from biogenic methane and CO₂. This breakthrough eliminates the need for water-intensive steam reforming or expensive electrolyzers, radically simplifying the SAF value chain.

To convert that syngas into high-yield jet fuel, Syzygy has selected Velocys and its microFTL technology, known for reliability and for maximizing fuel output, both critical factors in driving down the total cost required to produce synthetic fuel.

""This project proves that profitable SAF production doesn't have to wait on future infrastructure,"" said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. ""With Velocys, we're bringing in a complete, modular solution that drives down overall production costs and is ready to scale. Uruguay is only the start.""

""We're proud to bring our FT technology into a project that's changing the game,"" said Matthew Viergutz, CEO of Velocys. ""This is what innovation looks like—fast, flexible, and focused on making SAF production affordable.""

NovaSAF 1 Project Highlights:

Nameplate capacity: 500,000 gallons/year of ASTM D7566-compliant SAF

Feedstocks: Dairy waste, biogenic methane, and CO₂

Power source: 100% renewable electricity

Technology: Syzygy's NovaSAF™ platform + Velocys' microFTL™ technology

This trial also resulted in significant volumes of hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) diesel, marking a major step forward in the refinery’s transition to low-carbon fuel production.

As part of the European Union’s renewable energy goals, member states are required to increase the share of advanced biofuels and SAF in the transport sector by 2030. To meet these obligations, INA plans to finalize all necessary preparations and begin regular SAF production by 2029, aligning with the EU’s broader decarbonization strategy for aviation.

The pilot run, conducted between 5 and 13 May, processed 1,000 tons of palm oil mill effluent, accounting for 5 percent of the total feedstock used alongside conventional crude. The hydrocracking technology was licensed by Chevron Lummus Global, and the final products were certified by Bureau Veritas under the ISCC sustainability standard.

Realizing the pilot required eight months of intensive planning and adaptation. This included sourcing specialized filters, adjusting laboratory protocols, and upgrading the hydrocracker and vacuum distillation units. INA’s Central Testing Laboratory collected over 400 samples for detailed analysis, with carbon-14 testing carried out in accredited laboratories in Zagreb and Debrecen.

Ivica Jerbic, INA’s Development Director, stated that the pilot demonstrates how existing refinery infrastructure can be repurposed to reduce carbon emissions and boost the use of renewable components in transportation fuels. The initiative benefited from collaboration with MOL Group partners and key technology providers.

The Zug-headquartered manager is leading a consortium that also includes TPG, GIC and Mubadala Investment Company in acquiring 100 percent of the German submetering and energy services firm – which Partners Group described as “critical to advancing the long-term decarbonisation of the real estate sector” – for an enterprise value of €6.7 billion, according to a statement released on Monday.

Partners Group first invested in the company in 2018, when its private equity business led a consortium that also included Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. Under the group’s ownership, revenues reached over €1 billion and EBITDA grew around 50 percent. As part of the new transaction, that consortium will exit its stakes in the company.

The transaction follows the collapse of a previous agreement for TPG and GIC to acquire Techem outright, first announced last October. The sale fell through earlier this year after the prospective buyers withdrew their notification to the European Commission in May, documents show.

Straddling the line

Partners Group’s decision to transfer the company from its PE to infra business speaks to its asset class-straddling characteristics. Techem’s main business activity is energy management and provision of services, which includes devices for the metering and billing of energy and water. As it has grown, it has increasingly benefited from infrastructure themes, such as a growing focus on energy efficiency, corporate decarbonisation goals and higher energy costs, Partners Group said.

Partners Group recognised Techem’s potential as an infrastructure play when it first invested in the company. Though most of the capital for the 2018 acquisition was provided by firm’s private equity division, the infrastructure division provided support, a spokeswoman told affiliate title Infrastructure Investor at the time.

Like Partners Group, GIC seems to be treating Techem as an infra asset. Infrastructure CIO Boon Chin Hau described it as “uniquely positioned to drive energy efficiency within the real estate sector” in the announcement.

TPG, on the other hand, has invested in Techem from its private equity funds, Rise Climate I and Rise Climate II, a source familiar with the transaction told New Private Markets. The second Rise Climate fund is still in market and had raised $5.42 billion in March on its way to an $8 billion target. The first fund closed on $7.3 billion in 2022.

TPG, which declined to comment, does have a climate infrastructure fund, Rise Climate Infrastructure. It remains in market and had raised $1.3 billion as of November.

Mubadala’s investment has come from its energy and sustainability unit, which sits within the investor’s private equity platform.

Returns convergence

Elsewhere in its business – the secondaries space – Partners Group is reporting its infrastructure strategy to be delivering returns more akin to those of a private equity buyout strategy. The manager generated returns of $1.5 billion in the first half of this year from its infra secondaries business via full and partial exits. The full exits are expected to deliver returns of around 20 percent net internal rate of return and a 2.4x net total value to paid-in ratio, according to details shared with affiliate title Secondaries Investor.

Much of the returns, particularly for fully exited assets during the period, came from the US power generation sector and what Partners Group refers to as the “flexible energy theme”, a managing director in the firm’s infrastructure partnership investments unit, Marc Meier told Secondaries Investor.",https://media.newprivatemarkets.com/uploads/2023/06/Business-deal-handshake-NPM.png,N,,2025-07-17 11:20:07.715074

As climate disasters worsen, both the federal and local response is increasingly politicised

Texas has experienced a devastating flood that claimed more than 100 lives — including 27 young girls — when cabins, located in a known floodplain, were overtaken by rising waters from the nearby Guadalupe River. There was no adequate warning system. No protection. No infrastructure in place to prevent this tragedy.

This was not just a natural disaster, it was a systemic failure. And it did not happen in isolation.

Floods are hitting communities across the country: New Mexico, North Carolina, Buffalo, one after another. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has already predicted up to 25 named storms this year.

The Atlantic is so warm that it is fuelling a storm season we are just beginning to feel, and every year we break the previous year’s record for climate-fuelled disasters.

These events are not just heartbreaking, they are predictable and they are preventable. But unfortunately, they are being politicised at a time when what we need most is leadership, not partisanship.

Disaster response should not be political

We have reached a dangerous moment when it has become “partisan” to help communities recover from disaster. When did it become political to provide rapid emergency response service to communities in need: a central and core service of a nation to its citizens?

President Donald Trump’s federal staff cuts are leaving our nation’s key weather management agencies — Noaa and the Federal Emergency Management Agency — depleted and less able to manage emergencies.

These effective agencies were cut due to the Trump administration’s anti-climate change stance, leaving the federal government less able to protect communities.

The Trump administration has slashed tens of thousands of federal staff positions, and many of them are critical to our nation’s emergency preparedness

The National Weather Service has suffered a 20 per cent cut — even as 72 per cent of Americans say the federal government should play a role in tracking weather events and warning people about natural disasters, according to an Associated Press poll from June.

I served in the Joe Biden administration for two years, advising the president on climate, resilience and on housing, and I saw first hand how clear-eyed leadership can protect people both before, during and after a disaster.

Our house is on fire

In the Biden-Harris administration, we viewed resilience and disaster response as a national security imperative, and as a core function of federal leadership. We invested in flood maps, resilience hubs, risk modelling tools, alert systems and the staffing needed to help communities plan and rebuild. The consequences are real, and the threats are escalating in scale and destruction.

We did this together, across all walks of life and political stripes. Red states, blue states — we came together and led. When your house is on fire, there is no time for partisanship.

We helped pass the largest climate risk reduction package in US history: a bipartisan effort that invests nearly $370bn to cut the root causes of global warming by 40 per cent and protect communities nationwide.

That progress is under threat. The current administration is moving to rescind these funds — ignoring the clear and urgent reality we all face. Climate risk does not care how you vote. We should not either.

The Trump administration has slashed tens of thousands of federal staff positions, and many of them are critical to our nation’s emergency preparedness: Fema staff, environmental regulators, infrastructure engineers, disaster recovery teams.

These are the people who protect our air and water, keep our roads safe, and respond when disaster strikes.

Worse still, the federal flood risk management standard — originally developed under President Barack Obama, repealed by President Trump, and reinstituted by President Biden — was quietly dismantled once again earlier this year.

We cannot afford to sit on the sidelines while the tools that keep us safe are dismantled

That standard was designed to ensure that federally funded infrastructure would not be rebuilt in known flood zones, that our tax dollars would not be wasted, and that lives would be saved. Its removal is not just shortsighted, it is dangerous.

Tools such as the national climate assessment, once used by local and state governments to guide planning, are being defunded and buried. Fema’s programmes that supported local planning and resilience are being starved. This is not just a policy shift, it is an erasure of science, safety and public responsibility.

Who benefits?

No one benefits from communities being hollowed out by disaster. No one wins when neighbourhoods are lost to fire or flood. But some are benefiting from the weakening of federal guardrails: developers building in high-risk zones, industries polluting with impunity, and policymakers pushing austerity over safety.

The American people, however, are not benefiting. We are paying the price — in lives lost, homes destroyed and futures upended.

We need urgent, non-partisan action. The climate crisis is not coming, it is here. And the response must be bold, consistent, and grounded in justice. It is the federal government’s job to protect its people. Not just with words, but with infrastructure, data, science and action.

We cannot afford to sit on the sidelines while the tools that keep us safe are dismantled. And we cannot let compassion, competence or disaster recovery become partisan. Because next time, it could be your city. Your home. Your family.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/d9e1c4dc-af3e-4f91-b8dd-b362b608e681.jpg,N,,2025-07-17 11:20:17.325022

“We see SAF as an important part of our BA Better World strategy. In 2024 alone, SAF accounted for 2.7% of British Airways’ total fuel use and is contributing to our achievement of a 13% reduction in our carbon intensity since 2019,” BA’s director of sustainability, Carrie Harris said.

BA has made a commitment to fuel 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030 and to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

BioTfueL® technology has been selected for the BioTJet project by Elyse Energy and its partners (Axens, Avril, IFPEN). This project will produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from end-of-life wood waste & local forestry residues with the addition of green hydrogen. By 2029, BioTJet will supply sustainable aviation fuel to reduce carbon intensity in air transport, and e-bio-naphtha for road transport and bio-sourced chemistry. Axens signed a license agreement for BioTfueL® technology in 2024, which includes a PRENFLO® gasification technology from thyssenkrupp Uhde, a GASEL® technology from Axens (Fischer-Tropsch and Upgrading) with a basic engineering completed in November 2024 and currently being within the detail engineering phase.

The aviation industry is considered as one of the hard-to-abate sectors in the green transformation, and sustainable aviation fuels are required by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, starting with a 2 % quota in 2025 and aiming for

70 % SAF in all EU airports from 2050. The BioTJet project is based on the E-BioTfueL concept, which combines biomass eligible to produce advanced biofuels (RED EU definition), and green or low-carbon hydrogen eligible to produce renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RED EU Definition, also called e-fuels). The technology brings proven process building blocks which have been developed and tested in a semi-industrial plant from 2010 to 2021 by the Bionext consortium consisting of Avril, Axens, CEA, IFP Energies nouvelles, Total Energies and thyssenkrupp Uhde.

The PRENFLO® gasification technology is part of thyssenkrupp's Decarbon Technologies portfolio and will contribute to the sustainable production of biomass-based synthetic products, including methanol, hydrogen, and SAF. With its origins in the Koppers-Totzek process, the PRENFLO® technology has been continuously refined to meet evolving industry needs. It is known for its robustness and flexibility, capable of handling a wide range of feedstocks.

Pascal Penicaud, President of Elyse Energy: “After thoroughly examining the available and bankable technologies, we are now more convinced than ever that we have made the right choice for our project with the E-BioTfueL concept and the technology partners involved to provide cost-competitive SAF and naphtha to the market by 2030 and contribute to address climate change.”

Nadja Håkansson, CEO of thyssenkrupp Uhde: “We are proud to see how the E-BioTfueL concept – which includes our advanced PRENFLO® technology – has now turned into a first commercial Biomass-to-SAF application in the European Community. The collaboration with our French partners underscores our commitment to driving the green transformation and delivering sustainable value to our customers and stakeholders.”

Quentin Debuisschert, CEO of Axens: “Axens, along with our parent company IFP Energies Nouvelles, has invested significant capital in demonstrating technologies at semi commercial scale and advancing the energy transition, particularly in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) processes. We are thrilled to be part of the BioTJet project, which is strategic for Axens and our longtime partner thyssenkrupp Uhde. The BioTJet project leverages a breakthrough technology, BioTfueL®,"" underscoring our commitment to innovative solutions in the energy sector.”

Advanced biofuels from sustainable feedstocks

With over 100 gasifiers successfully realized, Uhde is both a pioneer and world leader in gasification technology. PRENFLO® is a pressurized, entrained-flow gasification technology developed and first demonstrated by thyssenkrupp Uhde in the late 1980s. It has been implemented in various large-scale projects, including the world's largest single-train, solid feedstock-based IGCC (integrated gasification combined-cycle) power plant, owned and operated by ELCOGAS, located in Puertollano, Spain, and continuously developed further to the application of 100 % biomass. The technology uses so-called second-generation biogenic feedstocks such as waste wood, wood chips, straw, forest residues and agricultural waste. The BioTJet project underscores thyssenkrupp Uhde's commitment to advancing clean energy technologies and supporting the global transition to sustainable sources.

US investigates Brazil barriers to US ethanol

Houston, 16 July (Argus) — The US Trade Representative (USTR) has launched an investigation into Brazilian trade practices that include import barriers against US ethanol. The USTR investigation will look at Brazilian trade barriers that US ambassador Jamieson Greer claims ""restrict the ability of US exporters to access its market."" ""Brazil's tariff and non-tariff barriers merit a thorough investigation, and potentially, responsive action,"" he said. The notice for the investigation said US ethanol producers are unfairly affected by an 18pc tariff that Brazil imposes on US ethanol exports. The US and Brazil are the two largest ethanol-producing countries, combining for 52pc and 28pc of global production, respectively, according to data from the Renewable Fuels Association, an ethanol trade group. US exports to Brazil averaged 3,800 b/d, or just 2.7pc of overall US exports from January to May, according to US Department of Agriculture data. Exports to Brazil in 2024 were valued at $53mn, down from a peak of $761mn in 2018, according to the investigation notice. The US imported just 491 b/d from Brazil during the first five months of the year, equivalent to 81pc of total ethanol imports. The US imposes a combined 12.5pc tariff on Brazilian ethanol, which includes the blanket 10pc tariff announced in April and the existing 2.5pc duty. Growth Energy, another US ethanol trade organization, applauded the investigation. ""Today's action by USTR is a sign that the old days of Brazil enjoying unfettered access to the US ethanol market while unfairly putting a tariff on American ethanol imports could soon come to an end,"" chief executive Emily Skor said. US President Donald Trump's administration earlier this year specifically noted Brazilian trade barriers against US ethanol as unfair and worth addressing. Trump has recently threatened to impose a 50pc tariff on Brazilian imports starting 1 August, but tied those threats to the country's prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro for trying to overthrow elections in 2022. The Trump administration has discouraged Brazilian ethanol imports in other ways, including by proposing to revamp a long-running biofuel blend mandate by reducing lucrative credits for fuels made abroad. Last year, the Renewable Fuels Association and Growth Energy threatened to not cooperate with Brazil on ethanol or sustainable aviation fuel partnerships if the country did not eliminate the tariff. Reducing trade barriers in Brazil has been a longtime priority for the US ethanol lobby, which sees the potential to compete more in Brazil's Renovabio biofuel program. USTR will accept comments through 18 August with a hearing for the investigation scheduled for 3 September.

US refiners lobby to revive expired biofuel credits

New York, 16 July (Argus) — A group of small oil refiners asked US officials at a recent meeting to not just grant exemptions from years-old biofuel blend mandates but to also provide lucrative program credits they can sell to other companies. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed record-high biofuel blend mandates for the next two years, but farm groups fear that a backlog of exemption requests threaten those targets. There are more than 180 unresolved exemption requests stretching over 10 years after courts struck down various denials during former-president Joe Biden's term. Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, oil refiners and importers must annually blend biofuels or buy Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits from those that do. But refiners that process 75,000 b/d or less of crude and can prove ""disproportionate economic hardship"" are able to request full exemptions which can mean tens of millions of dollars in reduced compliance costs. In a 20 May meeting with EPA officials, a coalition of small refiners made the case that President Donald Trump's administration should not just grant broad relief from 2019-2022 mandates but also issue ""replacement RINs"" for any refiners that already complied. EPA should issue these RINs ""with adequate lead time"" before compliance deadlines and ensure they have ""adequate shelf life"", according to a proposal shared with EPA by a coalition lawyer and obtained by Argus through a Freedom of Information Act request. The agency should even consider giving companies more credits than they submitted if RINs are cheaper now, the group argued. RINs from those years are otherwise expired and would be useless if returned as is. ""Hardship relief is more critical now than ever"", the group of 14 companies argues, given rising biofuel quotas. The issue is politically tricky for EPA, since widespread waivers threaten biofuel and crop demand, and has been the subject of numerous court fights over the years. The first Trump administration handed out exemptions generously , but current officials have not yet staked out a clear position. EPA told Argus it is taking steps ""to reduce the backlog as soon as possible"". Living RIN the past EPA could potentially return credits on a staggered timeline or impose conditions on their use to avert market turmoil, according to lawyers and lobbyists experienced in waiver issues. The proposal alludes to this, noting however that ""any conditions on RIN return that are intended to address potential market reactions must strike the appropriate balance to ensure flexibility to small refineries"". Biofuel groups have lobbied against retroactive waivers but said that EPA could minimize the damage by making other oil companies blend more biofuels. The agency should ensure that any exemptions ""will be made up in the market"", said Emily Skor, president of ethanol lobby Growth Energy, at a hearing last week. But the refiners' proposal argues that EPA is not required to do so if it grants exemptions retroactively. The agency has estimated future exemptions when calculating the percentage of biofuels individual refiners must blend — frustrating large producers that then shoulder more of the burden of meeting high-level targets — but doing the same with past-year waivers is more legally risky. The small refiners float a less aggressive approach for other compliance years. The proposal notably makes no reference to petitions for relief from 2016-2018 quotas. EPA under Biden rejected 31 petitions for those years but did not require companies to surrender additional RINs, potentially making any push for extra relief a tougher sell despite courts' skepticism of the underlying denials. And for 2023 and beyond, the refiners say that EPA should rely on ""merit-driven scoring"". EPA already consults with the Department of Energy, which scores hardship for individual applicants, though the importance of this feedback has varied over the program's history. The coalition also wants EPA to rescind three 2023 compliance year denials issued during the final days of Biden's term, which affected two Calumet refineries and one CVR Energy refinery. RINto the future The coalition's proposal is notable since small refiners — apart from a handful recently calling for a ""seat at the table"" — have largely not publicized their asks of the Trump administration, leading traders to speculate wildly on policy shifts. RIN prices have been volatile as a result. The coalition includes 14 companies that submitted 41 petitions that courts have told EPA to reconsider as well as 37 requests for more recent years, the proposal says. They are represented by independent attorney Claudia O'Brien, who did not respond to a request for comment. The documents obtained by Argus do not list all companies involved in the effort, but lawyers for Calumet, Par Pacific and Placid Refining were scheduled to attend the May meeting in person with top EPA appointees Aaron Szabo and Alexander Dominguez, while others attended virtually. O'Brien said in a separate email that Hunt Refining, REH Company, and Ergon were part of the coalition. The policy requests represent the position of one group and not necessarily all 34 refineries EPA estimates are eligible for future waivers. It is not clear how officials responded at the meeting or what options they are weighing now. EPA wants to finalize new blend mandates before November and has said it plans to communicate its approach to exemptions beforehand.

Q&A: Ships to use bioblends to comply with new IMO rule

Sao Paulo, 15 July (Argus) — Bioblends are the best short-term option for ships to comply with International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations set to be approved in October, according to Andrea Lucchesi , professor at the University of Sao Paulo and an expert on the impact of maritime regulations. Lucchesi, who presented research on the potential economic impacts of the IMO-approved carbon pricing mechanism at the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) 83 in April, spoke to Argus about the recent IMO agreement and the future of decarbonization in shipping. Edited highlights follow. Under the current IMO carbon pricing mechanism, which fuel emerges as the main solution for decarbonization? New studies are being conducted in this regard. As the details of the mechanism will still be defined in October, there is no clarity regarding the next bunker fuels, especially because we cannot just consider the decarbonization potential, but also the cost of port infrastructure and vessel adaptation. Also, the ports will adapt very slowly. What I can say is that the first fuel to be adopted in the transition phase will be the marine biofuel blends, because of their economic viability, emissions reduction potential and supply availability. Is the agreement, as it progressed in MEPC 83, economically and environmentally successful? The agreement approved on 11 April is historic. It is the result of more than seven years of negotiation and is the first to regulate an entire sector of the economy at the international level. Therefore, we consider the agreement a success, even though it has been modified from its initial design, and it is sufficient to achieve the goal of decarbonizing the maritime sector by 2050. Have the GHG reduction targets been made too flexible over the many years of debate? The study I conducted for the IMO aimed to measure the impact of this pricing mechanism, because if we try to accelerate decarbonization beyond market capacity, we will see very strong consequences, especially in developing countries. A more rigid goal is not appropriate. Do you believe the agreement will be approved in October as it was designed, despite the US opposing the measure? Yes. The US will try to influence the matter, but there is considerable support for the measures. They have already been widely debated in recent years. Is the mechanism, as it progressed in the April meetings, economically viable for the entire maritime chain to adapt? The agreement will impact countries very differently. We were careful to assess the impacts on food inflation and the potential impact on malnutrition in developing countries. There will be socioeconomic impacts, so the measures needed to be gradual, as they will be. For example, there needs to be time for ships to be retrofitted, investment in technical measures to increase efficiency, and fuel replacement. Another point is that port technology needs to be adapted. Therefore, the mechanism should begin pricing in 2028, with reduction targets ranging from a modest 4-17pc for the first year. In any case, the sector will have to adapt, because the agreement will be effective in punishing those who do not comply. This agreement will work. The IMO is an institution with the capacity to effectively monitor and punish, and there are mechanisms in place to do so. How much is expected to be raised from the carbon pricing? The revenue generation potential, as it stands today, is $1bn/yr in the initial years, with a growth trend in subsequent years. This revenue is intended to mitigate the socioeconomic impacts of the mechanism on small island nations and developing countries.

The one-year supply agreement, running through June 2026, marks DHL’s first SAF procurement for its international flights from Singapore.

The fuel will be produced at Neste’s Singapore refinery, the world’s largest SAF production facility, and delivered directly into Changi’s fuel infrastructure.

SAF Utility Expansion

Neste will supply DHL Express with 9.5 million liters of unblended Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which will be blended with conventional jet fuel and used for flights operated by DHL’s fleet of five Boeing 777 freighters.

The aircraft are based at DHL’s South Asia Hub at Changi and operate 12 weekly departures to destinations in Asia and the Americas.

The SAF blend will comprise roughly 35-40 percent of total jet fuel used for these flights, the companies said.

The move supports both DHL’s emissions reduction goals and Singapore’s national target to mandate the use of 1 percent SAF for all departing flights from 2026.

“This partnership with Neste to procure and uplift SAF for DHL Express’ international air cargo flights from Singapore is a significant milestone,” said Christopher Ong, Managing Director for DHL Express Singapore. “We are not just meeting industry standards but setting them.”

Neste Expands Regional Footprint

Carl Nyberg, senior vice president for commercial, renewable products at Neste, said the agreement reflects the company’s strategy to scale up SAF adoption through regional hubs. “We are excited to expand our cooperation with DHL to Singapore, a leading aviation hub in Asia-Pacific,” he said.

Neste currently has a global SAF production capacity of 1.5 million tons per year, which it aims to increase to 2.2 million tons by 2027.

Its SAF is made from renewable waste and residue materials such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste and can reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel, according to the company.

Wider Decarbonization Drive

DHL Express is one of the world’s largest users of SAF in the logistics sector. The agreement builds on a global partnership between the two companies to decarbonize both air and road transportation.

The deal is aligned with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, or CORSIA, a global framework to cap net CO₂ emissions from international flights.

SAF is certified for use in commercial aviation and can currently be blended up to 50 percent with traditional jet fuel. It is considered one of the most immediate tools available to reduce emissions in the aviation industry.

According to the Draghi Report, around 100 billion EUR in investment is needed annually for the energy transition of European shipping and aviation. The Clean Industrial Deal identifies aviation and shipping as one of the most difficult industries to decarbonise, specifically calling on the upcoming STIP to outline short- and medium-term scalable measures to prioritise support for clean fuels for shipping and aviation.

Against this background, European Shipowners (ECSA) and Airlines for Europe (A4E) call on the Commission to prioritise investments in production, distribution, and affordability of clean, safe, and affordable maritime and aviation fuels for the energy transition.

The statement aligns with a similar call by the Clean Maritime Fuels Platform, which urged the European Commission to establish dedicated maritime funding windows in the upcoming STIP to support the production, distribution and adoption of clean maritime fuels.

Make clean fuels available for shipping and aviation

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) agreed in April on its IMO Net-Zero Framework. European Shipowners welcome this critically important development, as shipping requires one regulatory framework at the international level and full harmonisation of the EU legislation with the IMO climate agreement. The transition of international shipping to net zero is expected to create demand for clean fuels at the international level. Thus, the IMO measure will be an opportunity for European energy producers to make these fuels available in the market as long as the necessary investments are made.

EU ETS revenues generate around €10 billion from shipping and aviation annually for the EU and EU/EEA Member States. These revenues must be reinvested in the energy transition of shipping and aviation, as long as the two sectors are paying under the EU ETS.

Several Member States, including France and Germany, have recently pledged to earmark revenues for maritime and aviation decarbonisation, particularly for clean fuel production. Therefore, a requirement to direct the national ETS revenues from shipping and aviation for the decarbonisation of these sectors should be introduced in STIP.

Strengthen production capacity and bridge the price gap

The current regulatory framework presents an opportunity for European fuel suppliers to establish a strong industrial base in Europe for clean fuel production for shipping and aviation, in line with the objectives of the Competitiveness Compass and the Clean Industrial Deal. A 40% mandate for clean fuels and technologies produced in Europe in line with the Net Zero Industry Act will provide certainty to energy producers and manufacturers.

STIP should support the production and affordable uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and low- and zero-carbon maritime fuels, by de-risking offtakes, narrowing the price gap with conventional fuels, stabilising prices, and unlocking large-scale investment. Funding should go beyond state-of-the-art projects and ensure the scale-up and deployment of clean fuels and technologies already available on the market.

In addition, according to the joint statement, priority access to clean fuels should be given to shipping and aviation.

Simplification

Administrative burden should be limited to ensure that SMEs, which are the backbone of the shipping sector, can apply to the Innovation Fund calls and access this support. This could be achieved by revising the criteria to apply to the Innovation Fund, which currently does not deliver either for shipping or aviation, particularly in the context of fuels production projects.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-fuels-photo-scaled-e1649141683560.jpg,N,,2025-07-17 07:10:19.772580

Namibia has made progress in aviation decarbonisation through national capacity building, regulatory development, and policy improvement.

This is according to Namibia Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) executive director Toska Sem.

Sem was speaking on Wednesday at a regional workshop on sustainable aviation fuel and emissions reduction underway in Windhoek.

The three-day event, which ends Friday, is organised by the NCAA in collaboration with the European Union (EU) and the EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

The workshop focuses on the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation (CORSIA), sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), and CORSIA Eligible Fuels (CEF).

It forms part of the EU-CORSIA Africa and Caribbean project, which aims to build technical capacity for carbon dioxide mitigation in the international aviation sector, particularly in developing countries.

Sem said Namibia submitted its first State Action Plan (SAP) to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in 2016.

Namibia has been part of the CORSIA scheme since 2017.

“In June 2023, the Namibia Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) recognised the need to identify key implementers, which birthed the SAP Steering Committee, composed of representatives from regulators, operators, ministerial agencies, academia, and development partners. I must admit that this committee has become the engine for holistically driving national action on environmental protection, more specifically in aviation,” she said.

She said the workshop is more than a technical session, stressing that it is a strategic platform to understand and apply the economic and environmental benefits of SAF and CEF.

Sem said it also helps build national capacity in emissions assessment, sustainability certification, and offsetting while translating global commitments into local frameworks.

“The focus on feedstocks, blending standards, and SAF value chains speaks directly to our envisioned national context. Namibia’s emerging green hydrogen programme, our abundance of residue biomass from bush encroachment, and recent power-to-X feasibility studies underscore our potential to become a regional hub for SAF production,” she said.

“I am hopeful that this workshop will help us unlock that potential further. We are all aware that Namibia is blessed with rich renewable energy resources ranging from solar, wind, and biomass.”

She said the government’s declaration of green hydrogen as a strategic pillar for national development aligns with the vision for SAF production.

NCAA’s communications manager said expert facilitator Mark Latimer from the EU-CORSIA project is leading the workshop.

He is covering topics such as the SAF value chain and blending standards, life cycle emissions and sustainability certification, and integrating SAF into national policy.",https://www.observer24.com.na/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cropped-WO-App-Icon-Apple-1-32x32.jpeg,N,,2025-07-17 11:21:37.990691

Overview Of The Airbus A220 The Airbus A220 is Airbus' smallest aircraft.","The Airbus A220 is one of the most interesting aircraft to have been developed in the 21st century. Originally designed by Bombardier as the C-Series, Airbus acquired the program in 2018, and since then, Airbus has continued to invest in the aircraft. Airbus is incorporating new upgrades in avionics, continues to bump the plane's Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW), and is improving the sustainability of the A220.

The Airbus A220 was originally named the Bombardier CSeries, with its two variants being dubbed the CS100 and the CS300. The CS100, now the A220-100, is a smaller aircraft slotting below Airbus and Boeing's smallest models, while the CS300, now the A220-300, directly replaces the Airbus A319-100 and Boeing 737-700. While the aircraft wasn't designed as an Airbus, the European planemaker is gradually improving the plane to ensure that it stays competitive.

New Improvements Coming To The A220

Airbus is promising to incorporate various software upgrades to the A220. While the A220 is the newest commercial airliner currently in service, there are certain systems developed by Airbus that are not currently present on the former Bombardier. In 2026, Airbus will incorporate the latest version of the company's runway overrun protection, a system on other Airbus models that alerts pilots on whether a runway is too short for the aircraft to land safely.

Airbus will be incorporating HBCPlus Connectivity by 2028, which will improve onboard broadband access. Airbus is also planning for its entire lineup to be 100% compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030, including the A220. All together, Airbus is making the A220 more similar to the rest of its lineup, while also making it safer and more sustainable.

In addition to technological upgrades, Airbus is making the A220 more capable. Since taking control of the program, Airbus has increased the MTOW of both variants by three tons. It first began upgrading the A220 in 2020, and the latest bump is expected to be certified later this year. This will increase the A220's already exceptional range, while also increasing maximum payload range.

What Of The Stretched Airbus A220?

For years, rumors have floated around that Airbus was looking to develop a stretched variant of the A220. Commonly known as either the A220-500 or the A221, this stretch would directly compete with the Boeing 737 MAX 8 and Airbus' own A320neo. Given that stretched aircraft universally come with superior per-seat economics, the A220-500 or A221 is sure to be popular with the market.

Yet, seven years after taking control of the program, Airbus has not launched this stretched derivative. Reportedly, Airbus is looking to reduce production costs first and to increase production rates before launching what would be an expensive program. The A220 program is not yet profitable, so Airbus wants the plane to prove itself first before investing huge sums into a new variant. A decision is likely to come by the end of the year.

Beyond the costs of launching an A221 or A220-500, there's also concern about internal competition with the Airbus A320neo. The A320 line is fully paid for, so Airbus could likely make more money selling the A320neo instead of an A220-500 that isn't fully amortized. On the flip side, selling A221s would allow Airbus to sell more A321neos, which have higher margins than the A320neo.

Overview Of The Airbus A220

The Airbus A220 is Airbus' smallest aircraft. While it has zero commonality with other Airbus aircraft, it plays in a market not currently served by Boeing, greatly expanding Airbus' market reach. To date, Airbus has sold nearly 1,000 A220s and has delivered 430 examples.

The smaller A220-100 primarily competes with the Embraer E195-E2, while the A220-300 competes with the Boeing 737 MAX 7 as well as Airbus' own A319neo. The vast majority of A220 orders have been for the A220-300, as only 118 A220-100s have been ordered.

While the A220 has sold slowly compared to the A320neo and 737 MAX, it remains a popular choice for airlines serving smaller markets. With its carbon-composite construction as well as its advanced Pratt & Whitney PW1500G geared-turbofan engines, this is one of the most fuel-efficient aircraft ever constructed.

About the Biorefinery

The biorefinery is currently under construction within the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC), one of the largest integrated refinery and petrochemical developments in Asia, operated by PETRONAS. EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) work commenced in 2025, with operations targeted to start by the second half of 2028. The biorefinery will flexibly produce both SAF and HVO, depending on supply-demand dynamics. Its location in Johor, Malaysia, offers strategic geographical advantages with access to abundant feedstock sources in Asia and major international shipping routes, enabling it to meet growing global demand for biofuels.

The biorefinery is expected to have the capability to process about 650,000 tons per year of feedstocks to produce up to 12,500 barrels per day (approximately 725,000 KL annually) of biofuels such as SAF and HVO, positioning it as one of the largest biorefineries in Asia. The feedstocks to be used will include used cooking oil, animal fats, waste from vegetable oil processing, and other biomass including microalgae oils which will be explored in the mid-term.

Euglena’s Efforts Toward Biofuel Commercialization

Euglena, PETRONAS, and Eni announced joint consideration of the project in December 2022*3 and made the final investment decision in July 2024*4. Euglena initially held a 5% equity stake at the time of the joint venture company establishment in December 2024. By exercising its call option defined in the shareholders’ agreement signed in September 2024, Euglena increased its investment to the maximum 15%. As a result, Euglena will be able to handle approximately 100,000 KL of biofuels annually produced by the biorefinery.

At the time of biorefinery operation, Euglena intends to independently source feedstocks such as used cooking oil and supply them to the joint venture company. However, concerns have emerged that used cooking oil, currently the main feedstock for biofuels, may become increasingly scarce. Euglena is currently developing procurement partnerships across Asia. Furthermore, Euglena aims to initiate commercial production of microalgae for biofuel feedstocks in the early 2030s and has been promoting R&D to establish large-scale, low-cost cultivation technologies by 2030.

Recent developments include a comprehensive joint research agreement signed in August 2024 with PETRONAS Research Sdn. Bhd*5. and a successful scale-up demonstration of high-density tank cultivation announced in February 2025*6. Euglena remains committed to steadily advancing toward its ambitious goals.

The fuel will be produced at Neste’s Singapore refinery, the world’s largest SAF production facility, and deployed on DHL’s intercontinental Boeing 777 freighters operating from Changi Airport.

Christopher Ong, Managing Director for DHL Express Singapore, described the partnership as a critical step in advancing emissions reduction for air transport. “This partnership with Neste to procure and uplift SAF for DHL Express’ international air cargo flights from Singapore is a significant milestone for us,” he said. “Not only will it enable us to gain new strides in emissions reduction in air transport, but it also allows us to strengthen our commitment to customers to provide more sustainable shipping options.”

Under the terms of the deal, SAF will comprise between 35 and 40 per cent of the total fuel consumption for DHL’s five aircraft based at Changi, which undertake 12 weekly departures to destinations across Asia and the Americas. This marks DHL’s first SAF procurement for international flights departing Singapore.

Neste will supply the SAF blended with conventional jet fuel through Changi Airport’s fuel distribution network, leveraging its integrated supply chain. Compared to fossil jet fuel, Neste’s SAF delivers an approximate 80 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over its lifecycle.

Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste, highlighted the significance of expanding the collaboration. “We are excited to expand our cooperation with DHL to Singapore, a leading aviation hub in Asia Pacific,” he said. “It demonstrates how we are working together with DHL globally to help the company achieve its air transportation decarbonisation targets using a solution that is available at scale today.”

This strategic move aligns with Singapore’s Green Plan 2030 and supports the national objective of achieving a 1 per cent SAF usage across all flights—cargo and passenger—by 2026.

DHL Express is already among the largest global users of SAF, operating sustainable flights through key hubs in Amsterdam, Stockholm, Brussels, East Midlands, Los Angeles, Leipzig, Miami, San Francisco, Stansted and Nagoya. In 2022, the company introduced GoGreen Plus, a pioneering service enabling customers to address Scope 3 emissions through SAF, using a book-and-claim model that drives measurable decarbonisation benefits across the value chain.

In Singapore, DHL has also taken significant steps towards sustainability on the ground by converting its last-mile delivery fleet to electric vehicles, now the largest commercial EV van fleet in the country with 100 vehicles.

As part of DHL Group’s Strategy 2030, “New Energy” has been identified as a key growth pillar, with the Group developing end-to-end logistics solutions for the sustainable energy sector including wind, solar, EV batteries, charging infrastructure, energy storage systems, alternative fuels and hydrogen.

The Opportunity Green Report says that instead of ‘SAF’, aviation stakeholders should use the term ‘alternative fuel’, supplementing this with complete information about the fuel’s full lifecycle impact and aviation’s overall negative climate impacts.
The UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned a Virgin Atlantic radio advertisement for saying a flight was powered by “100% sustainable aviation fuel” (SAF), ruling the claim was misleading.
The report concludes that “there is a significant legal risk of using the term ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ in marketing, particularly when referring to waste-derived biofuels”.","NGO Opportunity Green is warning that airlines, financiers and fuel producers risk legal action by using the “misleading term” ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ (SAF).

The NGO calls SAF “a vague umbrella term that covers fuels with vastly different environmental impacts” and says the result is a “lack of clarity” which “can mislead consumers and investors”.

The warning comes in a new report: Fuelling misconceptions: the legal risks of advertising ‘sustainable aviation fuel’.

The report focuses on the effect of the term on both consumers and investors since the latter is essential for the financing of future SAF production, which needs to expand hugely to meet growing demand, powered by government mandates.

The UK’s own SAF Mandate starts this year at 2% of total UK jet fuel demand, increasing linearly to 10% in 2030 and then to 22% in 2040.

There is still a lack of production, however, and this week IATA stepped up criticism of the mandate, pointing out that the lack of regional supplies of the fuel means it had to be transported to be used. This week IATA’s director-general Willie Walsh was quoted by Reuters on the subject.

“The idea that you’re buying sustainable fuel and then transporting it to use in Europe isn’t the right way to do it because you’re clearly increasing the carbon footprint of that fuel as a result of the transportation costs.”

Both Europe and the UK are relying on imports of Unknown Cooking Oil (UCO) from China as well as Malaysia and Indonesia for feedstock for SAF, and this reliance is likely to increase since crop and virgin oil-based biofuels have been excluded as options as a result of concerns around indirect land-use changes and potential negative impacts on food production.

The Opportunity Green Report says that instead of ‘SAF’, aviation stakeholders should use the term ‘alternative fuel’, supplementing this with complete information about the fuel’s full lifecycle impact and aviation’s overall negative climate impacts.

The term has already been challenged in court, with the District Court of Amsterdam in Fossielvrij v KLM deciding it was “too absolute and not concrete enough” and therefore misleading to consumers.

In addition, consumer protection law in both the EU and UK prohibits businesses from engaging in misleading actions or omissions that can deceive consumers, such as providing false or incomplete information when advertising or marketing products or services.

The UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned a Virgin Atlantic radio advertisement for saying a flight was powered by “100% sustainable aviation fuel” (SAF), ruling the claim was misleading. The ASA determined that the unqualified claim omitted crucial information about the environmental impact of SAF, potentially misleading listeners about the fuel’s overall benefits.

The report concludes that “there is a significant legal risk of using the term ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ in marketing, particularly when referring to waste-derived biofuels”.

This article is based on a recent study into the recycling of aircraft batteries, commissioned by Aethos.","Making aviation truly sustainable is a long-term challenge that will take decades of innovation, collaboration and investment. While solutions like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and next-generation electric and hydrogen aircraft are making headlines, one area remains underexplored yet full of potential: recycling.

In this first article of a new series, Aethos takes a closer look at the opportunities and hurdles of aircraft recycling, starting with batteries. What types of batteries are used in aviation today? How recyclable are they? And what complexities stand in the way of closing the loop?

Batteries used in aircraft

Aircraft rely on a range of batteries to power various devices. Chief among them are the main batteries that start up the auxiliary power unit (APU), which then starts the systems and the engines; and the batteries that supply emergency power for critical equipment and flight control instruments. Of equal importance are the applications commonly known as the ‘black box’: flight data recorders (FDR) and cockpit voice recorders (CVR).

Inspired by the rise of electric cars and drones, the aviation industry also has a drive to develop batteries that will eventually be able to power whole airplanes. Electric flying is as yet only realised for small two-seater aircrafts on short-haul flights or lessons – but it is likely to gain traction in the near future, as the technology advances.

Recycling aircraft batteries: One size fits none

As a rule, batteries used in aircraft are highly customised to ensure maximum safety and reliability, while also delivering a high energy output at a low weight. Hence, no battery is the same. Because of this, recycling them is never straightforward. There are many different kinds of battery cells, modules and packs, using different materials and cell chemistries, requiring different recycling methods.

To complicate matters further, a battery comes with many additional components using a range of materials. Think of casings (stainless steel, titanium, plastic), connections and current collectors (copper, nickel-plated copper, aluminium), electrolyte (salt solutions, organic fluids, acid), cathode active materials (lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, iron phosphate, lead) as well as plastics for several purposes.

Handle with caution: How to dispose of batteries

It is no surprise, then, that recycling batteries is a task for specialised companies, in the form of acknowledged, Part 145-certified MRO shops. In addition, the US, China and the EU have introduced laws and regulations that increasingly make battery manufacturers in any industry responsible for collecting used batteries and ensuring sustainable processing, as well as reporting on their results.

In general, these facilities have two main recycling processes to choose from, both with their own advantages and drawbacks. The traditional approach is the pyrometallurgical process, using high temperatures to recover metals. It can be used for many types of batteries, both older and newer (lead-acid (Pb-acid), nickel-cadmium (NiCd), nickel metal-hydride (NiMh), lithium-ion (Li-ion)), without pre-treatment. However, it requires high energy use, its product recovery is limited, and resulting materials need further refining.

For newer types of batteries (NiMh and Li-ion), the alternative is a hydrometallurgical process, using aqueous solutions to dissolve and separate metals. Although still maturing, this process offers a lot more product recovery, producing higher purity materials. The downsides are the need for pre-treatment and the high use of chemicals, which requires extensive liquid waste management. First generation sulphate hydro-processes in particular produce lots of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), highly soluble in water, which amounts to a very unsustainable 1kg of waste for every kg of battery. Fortunately, the next generation of hydrometallurgical technology has found a way around this.

Due to the high cost and complexity of developing and certifying new technology, the aviation industry tends to continue using older battery types (Pb-acid, NiCd). Vested interests of the manufacturers of this technology also present a barrier to the wider adoption of newer, cleaner alternatives.

Beyond recycling: Black box batteries

Many batteries used in aircraft can be recycled. Notable exceptions are the batteries used for emergency applications, such as FDRs and CVRs. To ensure their functioning under extreme conditions they run on non-rechargeable Li-metal batteries, for which there are as yet no sustainable recycling options available. Sadly, this means that end-of-life batteries are piling up in expensive containers specifically designed to mitigate the risks associated with storage of these batteries.

The future of battery recycling

Batteries play an important role in the energy transition and could become a major factor in the circular, emission-free aviation of the future. What can we do now to make this a reality?

Raising awareness is always a valuable first step. Do you know what your MRO organisation does with batteries that are beyond economical repair (BER) – when repairing them costs more than sourcing a new battery or battery section? The more industry professionals understand the available options, the better positioned they are to drive meaningful change.

OEMs such as SAFT also bear a responsibility to encourage a more sustainable approach to batteries, for instance by relaxing regulations in the component maintenance manual that currently favour replacing a battery when some cells are still functional. Another step might be to lower the price for individual cells, which makes revising a battery cheaper than replacing it.

Ideally, recycling where possible will become a standard requirement. Considering the budding ascent of electric aircraft, now is the time to make sure there are solutions in place for the current batteries before large volumes reach their end-of-life.

The insurance industry is facing mounting losses from climate-related disasters, and the effects are beginning to spread. Investors are increasingly concerned that climate change is turning insurance from a shock absorber into a vector for systemic financial risk.

Natural disasters caused around $320bn worth of economic damage in 2024, of which $140bn was insured, according to insurer Munich Re.

The highest proportion of insured extreme weather losses consistently occurs in the US, which was responsible for around 57 per cent of 2024’s total losses.

Given these risks, asset managers should consider excluding insurance companies exposed to certain geographies from their investment portfolios, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management chair David Semaya tells Sustainable Views.

“Insurance companies are doubly exposed to climate risk because they face risks both from their policies, and in their underlying investments,” he says. “I would consider potentially excluding [from investment portfolios] insurance companies that are focused on south Florida.”

While all sectors are exposed to some level of climate risk, Semaya warns that insurers that are overexposed to certain regions, including Florida and California, may face threats that are immediate and unmanageable.

Meanwhile, continued fossil fuel expansion — which scientists say is fuelling the climate crisis — is dependent on insurers underwriting new projects.

Analysis of 28 major property and catastrophe insurers by campaign group Insure Our Future found a striking feedback loop. In 2023, the insurers’ $10.6bn in climate-attributed losses were nearly equivalent to the $11.3bn earned in premiums from commercial fossil fuel clients.

Insure Our Future says this is a “fundamental contradiction” that threatens the industry’s long-term future and creates an “unjust burden” on communities worldwide.

Selective exclusions?

South Florida is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with increasingly intense hurricanes, extreme heat and rising sea levels. But it is far from alone.

From wildfires in Los Angeles to flash flooding in Texas, huge swaths of the US — and the rest of the world — are heavily exposed to extreme weather events.

“The question is, when do you pull the trigger? There may be some event that forces an allocation reduction to an industry like insurance,” says Semaya.

People are aware there’s a risk around future insurability, yet they still want to live in Florida, and asset prices keep going up

Daisy Streatfeild, Ninety One

Daisy Streatfeild, sustainability director at asset manager Ninety One, says housing and financial markets are “not appearing to behave rationally in the context of climate risk”, even though “the damages and costs are already there”.

“Obviously, there is insurance coverage at the moment, but people are aware there’s a risk around future insurability, yet they still want to live in Florida, and asset prices keep going up,” she adds.

Rather than a big bang moment, Streatfeild and Semaya believe these risks will more likely materialise as “a performance contraction for everybody slowly”.

Market resilience or complacency?

Taos Fudji, lead insurance climate risk analyst at S&P Global Ratings, says insurers are extremely well capitalised and that the risk appetite of reinsurers — insurance for insurers — remains healthy. He says equity and bond investors view the sector favourably, even as the risks rise.

The catastrophe bond market, a form of reinsurance, has grown exponentially in recent years, with $18.1bn worth of issuance by July 2025: already more than the $17.7bn sold in the whole of 2024. Investors are attracted by high yields and less correlation with broader financial markets.

In fact, property catastrophe reinsurance rates fell by 8 per cent this year, according to insurance broker Howden. This is partly due to increased capital supply: the industry has experienced two years of record profits, with reinsurance capital reaching $463bn at the end of 2024.

Fudji says it is also down to a broader softening of the market after a period of high pricing, explaining that the market is “at the highest point of the cycle”.

But Andrew Carrier, chief executive of insurer MS Amlin, is concerned by the asymmetry of extreme weather-related risks and falling reinsurance premiums. He warns that pricing and coverage terms are “failing to keep pace” with rising climate-related losses.

Insurers raise premiums in risky regions, and when that fails they pull out. This has already happened in areas of California, Florida and other parts of the US.

“We don’t like to throw our hands in the air and say we can’t provide coverage,” says Carrier. “But there are many times when it is impossible to calculate a fair premium . . . it would be so against the customer’s expectations that it’s just not productive to do.”

From risk transfer to risk contagion

Once insurers can no longer provide coverage at a price customers can accept, typically, the state will step in. As of 2023, nearly 6.8mn homes across the US were covered by state-backed insurance providers, though these often provide limited cover. Around 67 per cent of US homes are underinsured.

Plus, as insurer Allianz chair Günther Thallinger wrote on LinkedIn in March, “this assumes the state — ie the taxpayer — can afford to do so”.

If extreme weather events become both more frequent and more extreme, as scientists have projected, “no government can realistically cover the damages without either austerity or collapse”, added Thallinger.

These growing risks are not lost on policymakers. Prudential regulators have been encouraging financial institutions, including insurers, to manage systemic risk since the 2008 financial crisis.

We don’t like to throw our hands in the air and say we can’t provide coverage. But there are many times when it is impossible to calculate a fair premium

Andrew Carrier, MS Amlin

However, those efforts are now in jeopardy as the Donald Trump administration has forced a rollback at the global level.

This week’s update to the Financial Stability Board’s climate road map was described by campaigners as a major step back from the G20’s original ambition.

Despite earlier commitments to monitoring climate risk, the report contained no reference to ongoing supervisory measures. It will now have a narrower focus on physical risks and insurance coverage rather than broader systemic risk.

“There’s a real question of whether sustainability is just about your direct, immediate risks, or whether it’s about a responsibility for effective markets and preventing systemic risk in the long term,” says Streatfeild.

Being unable to access insurance means being unable to access a mortgage, which will hit property values. In a December 2024 report, the US Senate budget committee warned that plunging property values in communities where insurance is unavailable or prohibitively expensive could “trigger a full-scale crisis similar to what occurred in 2008”.

“The endgame of the rising cost of insurance is not so much a credit crisis for insurers, but an objective issue of consumers not being able to access insurance anymore, and public authorities setting aside taxpayer money,” says Fudji.

What begins as an insurance pricing problem could end in a full-scale financial crisis — one driven not by subprime mortgages as in 2008, but by the physical limits of a warming world.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/313ec1f5-bef9-4d5f-814a-20878f1b8fd2.jpg,N,,2025-07-17 05:04:08.741975

Institutional knowledge is slipping away, these people say. Boeing hasn’t launched a new airplane since December 2003 (the 787), they note. The 737 MAX is selling at a poor second to the Airbus A320neo family. Boeing continues to lose market share.

While airlines fret over delivery timelines stretching beyond a decade, one mid-tier lessor seems poised at an odd crossroads between scarcity and opportunity.

In the blink of an eye, thousands of jets vanished from production schedules, and the ripple is reaching Avation’s hangar doors. At first glance, the firm’s modest fleet of 34 aircraft, mostly ATR 72 turboprops with a handful of narrow-body types, might seem underwhelming beside industry giants. Yet those very constraints may be precisely what an investor needs to understand. As Airbus and Boeing juggle backlogs measured in four-figure sums and global passenger traffic out of the Asia-Pacific region leaps by over ten per cent year-on-year, a landlord with committed cash flows and targeted renewal opportunities is finding itself centre stage.

Behind the curtain, Avation’s balance sheet tells its own story. Last fiscal year delivered roughly US $92 million in revenue, underpinned by leases that extend eight to twelve years. Net debt runs at 57% of assets, bolstered by US $332 million of unsecured notes at an 8.25% coupon coming due in 2026. It is a structure that keeps the cost of capital front and centre and high leverage on the table for the next 12 to 18 months, even as refinancing markets remain supportive of aviation names. An imminent influx of collateral-rich turboprop deliveries, ten ATR 72-600s slated to join the roster over the next four years, will require fresh funding, yet also promise more resilient lease rates as airlines scramble for fuel-efficient regional equipment.

Imagine a virtual war room where analysts fire questions with clinical precision: what happens if Pratt & Whitney mandates an unscheduled service bulletin; how deep are the bankruptcy-remote safeguards; and can mid-life disposals be traded without compromising revenue visibility? The answer echoes across that digital workspace: scarcity lends clarity to pricing power. With more than 80% of residual values tied up in single-aisle new-generation jets and ATR turboprops, and just 15% of net book value scheduled for renewal over three years, Avation is effectively locked into a rising rental curve.

Crucially, Asia-Pacific airlines account for over half of Avation’s rent rolls. As the region’s market reopens and routes multiply, the value of a guaranteed fuel-efficient portfolio has never looked more compelling. Europe and Latin America add geographic diversification, but even in mature markets, the convenience of transferring mid-life assets between carriers promises a margin of safety should demand temper. Meanwhile, early positioning in sustainable aviation fuel–ready turboprops may insulate against impending regulatory and market shifts, preserving asset values when rivals eye second-hand ATRs with caution.",https://www.directorstalkinterviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Avation-plc.jpg,N,,2025-07-17 04:00:51.240698

The tax and policy bill President Trump signed this month changed some clean energy tax credits, but the carbon sequestration credits from the Biden era were basically preserved.","Former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack, a Democrat, suggests he and Republican Governor Kim Reynolds have something in common when it comes to rejecting bills to restrict the use of eminent domain. Reynolds vetoed a bill last month, saying it would impose new regulations on more than just a proposed carbon pipeline.

“The decision she made, if I understand it properly, is that there were deep concerns about the way in which the legislation was crafted and the unintended consequences of such legislation,” Vilsack said, “which is precisely the same reason I vetoed the legislation I vetoed.”

In 2006, during his last year as governor, Vilsack vetoed a bill designed to make it harder for cities and counties to use eminent domain authority to acquire land for economic development projects. Vilsack discussed his veto during a recent appearance on Iowa Press on Iowa PBS. “I think there’s a balance between individual property rights, which are really important to protect, and the need for a community to have economic opportunity and the kind of infrastructure that’s necessary for folks to have a quality of life in all parts of the country,” Vilsack said.

Vilsack suggests the lack of growth in Iowa’s rural areas is factor in the push back against the carbon pipeline. “I think if we had a healthier economy for small and mid-sized farming operations, we might not have quite the angst that we have in the countryside today,” Vilsack said, “which reflects itself in the push back on eminent domain.”

And Vilsack, who served a dozen years as the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, said the pipeline is about ensuring a future for the ethanol industry. “Our aviation industry is absolutely intent on having sustainable aviation fuel,” Vilack said. “You cannot make that fuel…cost-competitively unless you basically incent…the ability to basically capture the carbon that’s produced from developing that fuel and redirecting it someplace else.”

Speaking at a media roundtable in Singapore on Wednesday, IATA Director-General Willie Walsh said, “Transporting sustainable fuel from one region to Europe just to meet a mandate isn’t the solution. Doing so actually adds to the fuel’s carbon footprint.”

Sustainable aviation fuel is considered a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, but global production remains low. IATA estimates that SAF production will reach just 2 million metric tons in 2025, only about 0.7% of what airlines are expected to consume that year.

As per news report, Walsh also pointed out the disconnect between policy and reality. “If you require the use of a fuel that isn’t widely available, you’re not making any real environmental progress,” he said. He further noted that the push for SAF production is also driving up the cost of regular jet fuel, placing additional financial strain on the airline industry.

Established by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), APSAC aims to help countries in the region strike a balance between economic growth and environmental responsibility. It will focus on practical areas such as the development of cleaner aviation fuels, carbon auditing, and carbon market strategies.

The non-profit centre will also serve as a hub for collaboration, bringing together governments, industry leaders, and academic institutions to work on joint projects. It will provide technical assistance and training to support the creation and implementation of sustainable aviation policies across Asia-Pacific.

While the centre’s physical location has yet to be announced, all operations—including staffing and infrastructure—will be fully funded by CAAS.

CAAS has formed an advisory board to guide APSAC’s work. The board includes senior leaders from major aviation, energy, and finance players such as Airbus, Boeing, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Neste, Singapore-based investment platform GenZero, and the International Air Transport Association (IATA). A memorandum of understanding was signed on July 14 to formalize this partnership.

Singaporean officials believe air travel demand in the Asia-Pacific region will triple in the next two decades. At the same time, many countries in the region are setting net-zero emissions goals, creating a need for solutions that support both growth and sustainability.

Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS and Chair of APSAC, said the new centre would offer countries a range of policy tools suited to their national needs. “Countries in the Asia-Pacific are looking for ways to grow responsibly. This centre will help them move forward with practical options,” he said.

Australian and UK partners trialled the fuel technology in a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) KC-30A Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft for a special VIP flight.

SAF is a certified ‘drop-in’ fuel used in both military and civilian aviation around the world.

When blended with fossil-derived fuel in accordance with international standards, It requires no modifications to aircraft or fuel infrastructure and has the potential to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to fossil-derived fuel.

The SAF used on this mission, fuelling a 33 Squadron MRTT aircraft at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, ahead of a TS25 mission was supplied through Defence’s strategic fuel partner, Viva Energy.

Director General Fuel Capability, Brigadier Mark Baldock, says Talisman Sabre provides a valuable opportunity to trial new fuel technologies in a realistic operational setting.

“This is about improving energy security. Proving the viability of alternate fuels enhances fuel resilience by diversifying our supply chains. There is also the important benefit of reducing emissions, ” Brigadier Baldock said.

“Exercises like Talisman Sabre gives us a perfect opportunity to work with industry and international partners to trial next-generational fuels in ways that support capability and climate resilience.”

“We are building upon our current fuel system to ensure that it is fit for the future. We are doing it in lockstep with our industry partners, our international allies, and our own people on the ground and in the air.”

Flight Lieutenant Michael Que Hee, a pilot at 33 Squadron flying the mission, says that from a user perspective the switch to SAF was seamless.

“From the cockpit, there’s no difference, the aircraft flies exactly the same,” Flight Lieutenant Que Hee said.

“Knowing we are helping to enhance the fuel supply chain and reducing emissions just by doing our job makes it even more rewarding.”

Aircraft technician Leading Aircraftman Tikiri Lamb involved in the VIP flight preparation, echoed the same sentiment from the tarmac.

“With the same equipment and process, it’s just like refuelling with standard aviation fuel,” Leading Aircraftman Lamb said.

“It’s great knowing we are contributing to something bigger, while still doing our job the same way we always do.”

SAF is made from renewable feedstocks like used cooking oil, waste fats, and pant oils. It is part of a broader effort to accelerate Defence’s transition to cleaner energy in support of fuel security and resilience.

Defence’s use of SAF reflects key objectives outlined in the 2024 National Defence Strategy, the Defence Net Zero Strategy, and the Defence Future Energy Strategy, driving greater energy independence, climate responsibility, and fuel security.

""Like so many people across Colorado, you probably didn't know that CDOT does things with aviation across the state,” said David Ulane, CDOT’s aeronautics division director.
Nine employees within the Colorado Department of Transportation work exclusively on aviation projects, supporting the state's 76 public-use airports from Denver International Airport to the small Mineral County Airport in Creede.
The aeronautics division's work includes funding airport infrastructure projects, like helping pay for a runway at Del Norte's airport in southern Colorado.
It’s usually a federal funding factor in there usually, but this airport’s not eligible for federal funding,” said Shahn Sederberg, CDOT’s aeronautics division communications manager.","COLORADO, USA — Out of thousands of Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) employees, there are nine people that cannot complain about highway traffic.

Nine employees within the Colorado Department of Transportation work exclusively on aviation projects, supporting the state's 76 public-use airports from Denver International Airport to the small Mineral County Airport in Creede.

""There's 3,300 people or so that work for CDOT. There's precisely nine of us that don't do surface transportation,"" Ulane said.

The aeronautics division is funded entirely through state aviation fuel taxes:

2.9% state sales tax on jet fuel

4 cents per gallon for non-commercial users

6 cents per gallon for users like single engine airplanes

The current budget for CDOT aeronautics division is $53 million, all from aviation fuel taxes. None of it relies on the state’s general fund or federal grants. During COVID, when air travel plummeted, the budget was $17 million in 2021.

“Our revenue goes up and down as fuel sales go up and down,” Ulane said.

The aeronautics division's work includes funding airport infrastructure projects, like helping pay for a runway at Del Norte's airport in southern Colorado.

“We built a runway, which is really unheard of to do with state and local funds. It’s usually a federal funding factor in there usually, but this airport’s not eligible for federal funding,” said Shahn Sederberg, CDOT’s aeronautics division communications manager.

Sederberg shared the story of a Del Norte teacher who was able to be life-flighted out of the Del Norte airport to Pueblo, likely saving her life.

“The teacher was successfully life-flighted to Pueblo for emergency surgery instead of facing a potentially fatal ambulance ride to Alamosa,” Sederberg said. ""It was really cool to see someone who never uses the airport for anything else, but in that situation, saved their lives.”

The division also operates 13 high-altitude aviation weather stations that provide real-time weather information to pilots at locations including Berthoud Pass, Copper Mountain, Sunlight and Monarch Pass. In 2020, CDOT added aviation weather cameras to all 13 stations.

""It used to be only Canada and Alaska prior to 2020 that had any dots,"" Ulane said, referring to the weather camera network map. ""We know somehow, somewhere that what we did is going to keep somebody from perishing in an aircraft accident.”

The division also administers a surplus airport equipment program, helping smaller airports acquire expensive snow removal equipment from Denver International Airport at reduced costs. Denver sells used snow blowers worth $800,000 to $900,000 new for $50,000, with CDOT covering 80% of the cost.

“Those pieces of equipment are several $100,000 and for small airports like, let's say, Granby or Kremmling, that's something that may be out of the reach of those local airports,” Ulane said. ""For $10,000, a small community can have a very nice piece of snow removal equipment that they would not otherwise have.”

Looking ahead, the division is preparing for emerging aviation technologies including battery electric airplanes, hydrogen hybrid aircraft and sustainable aviation fuel, which will require new infrastructure considerations.

""Because right now, there's no aircraft charging stations in Colorado, and they take a lot more power than, let's say, a Tesla or something else,"" Ulane said.

These nine CDOT workers have to drive to Watkins to get to their office. Just don’t ask them about road conditions.

""When I walk around with the CDOT logo on my shirt, I get questions a lot, ‘Well, what the heck's going on with I-25 or I-70?” And I'm like, ‘I don't know, but if you've got any issues with airports, let's talk,'"" Sederberg said.",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/dfe47df6-1d00-41c5-952c-314e4931c778/20250717T002125/dfe47df6-1d00-41c5-952c-314e4931c778_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-16 23:06:42.727737

""We're proud to bring our FT technology into a project that's changing the game,"" said Matthew Viergutz, CEO of Velocys.
“Legacy FT technology drives up cost and complexity at a time when projects need to move faster and prove bankability,” Viergutz said.

The proposed facility, NovaSAF 1, will convert dairy waste into SAF using only renewable electricity and waste-derived gases.

A final investment decision on the project is expected to be made during the fourth quarter of 2025, with planned operations commencing in early 2027. Once fully operational, the project is expected to have the capacity to produce 500,000 gallons of SAF annually.

Houston-based Syzygy Plasmonics has developed light-driven chemical reactors that electrify and decarbonize fuel and chemical production. The NovaSAF platform converts biogenic CO2 and methane into ultra-low carbon fuels using renewable electricity. According to the company, this e-reforming technology produces the ideal 2:1 hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide syngas ratio for FT synthesis directly from biogenic methane and CO2. Syzygy Plasmonics said the process eliminates the need for water-intensive steam reforming or expensive electrolyzers, which radically simplifies the SAF value chain.

Velocys’ micoFTL reactor system, a modular FT technology package, will convert the resulting syngas into SAF. Velocys announced the commercial launch of microFTL in June. According to the company, microFTL combines microchannel FT reactors, a high-activity catalyst engineered at Oxford University, and deep FT process expertise, creating a scalable, cost-efficient, ready-to-deploy technology package that increases yield while lowering both CapEx and OpEx.

""This project proves that profitable SAF production doesn't have to wait on future infrastructure,"" said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. ""With Velocys, we're bringing in a complete, modular solution that drives down overall production costs and is ready to scale. Uruguay is only the start.""

""We're proud to bring our FT technology into a project that's changing the game,"" said Matthew Viergutz, CEO of Velocys. ""This is what innovation looks like—fast, flexible, and focused on making SAF production affordable.""

In its June announcement, Velocys explained that conventional FT systems were designed for fossil-based megaprojects. “Legacy FT technology drives up cost and complexity at a time when projects need to move faster and prove bankability,” Viergutz said. “microFTL is different. It’s efficient, modular, and already proven with a variety of feedstocks. We’re giving developers and integrators the tool they need to bring low-carbon fuels to market—at a cost that increases project value.”

Velocys microFTL technology has already been deployed in a landfill gas-to-diesel project in Oklahoma and a biomass-to-SAF project in Japan.

This pivotal development, announced on July 10, 2025, comes at a crucial juncture for the aviation industry. While SAF is widely recognized as the most viable immediate solution for reducing life cycle GHG emissions in aviation—with the potential to cut emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel when used neat—its production remains severely limited. Current estimates from IATA project that SAF production in 2025 will reach only 2.1 million tonnes, representing a mere 0.7% of total jet fuel production.

Since its launch in 2022, Avelia has established itself as a frontrunner in scaling SAF adoption. The platform enables companies to access the GHG benefits of SAF without being constrained by its physical availability at specific locations, thanks to its innovative ""book and claim"" mechanism. As of March 31, 2025, Avelia had already garnered the participation of over 57 corporations and airlines. This collective effort has led to the injection of over 33 million gallons of SAF into the global fuel network across 17 airport injection points worldwide, resulting in a substantial abatement of over 300,000 tonnes of CO2e.

The expanded Avelia platform introduces several key functionalities designed to enhance transparency, flexibility, and industry participation. A major change is the shift to independent data hosting, with Accenture now responsible for managing all platform data.

Furthermore, Avelia is evolving from a single-supplier platform (previously only accepting SAF supplied by Shell) to a multi-supplier solution. This significant change will allow users, including airlines, corporations, and freight forwarders, to access and manage the GHG benefits of SAF from various suppliers.

In another groundbreaking move, Avelia is looking to introduce a BYOS (Bring Your Own SAF) model. This feature will empower airlines to manage a larger portion of their SAF portfolio within Avelia, including SAF purchased outside of Shell's supply network or SAF that would otherwise have been tracked offline. The BYOS model is expected to further support the credibility of book and claim solutions at an industry level and significantly accelerate SAF adoption by providing a unified, digital registry.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-16 16:18:39.251494

Q&A: Ships to use bioblends to comply with new IMO rule

Q&A: Ships to use bioblends to comply with new IMO rule

Sao Paulo, 15 July (Argus) — Bioblends are the best short-term option for ships to comply with International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations set to be approved in October, according to Andrea Lucchesi , professor at the University of Sao Paulo and an expert on the impact of maritime regulations. Lucchesi, who presented research on the potential economic impacts of the IMO-approved carbon pricing mechanism at the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) 83 in April, spoke to Argus about the recent IMO agreement and the future of decarbonization in shipping. Edited highlights follow. Under the current IMO carbon pricing mechanism, which fuel emerges as the main solution for decarbonization? New studies are being conducted in this regard. As the details of the mechanism will still be defined in October, there is no clarity regarding the next bunker fuels, especially because we cannot just consider the decarbonization potential, but also the cost of port infrastructure and vessel adaptation. Also, the ports will adapt very slowly. What I can say is that the first fuel to be adopted in the transition phase will be the marine biofuel blends, because of their economic viability, emissions reduction potential and supply availability. Is the agreement, as it progressed in MEPC 83, economically and environmentally successful? The agreement approved on 11 April is historic. It is the result of more than seven years of negotiation and is the first to regulate an entire sector of the economy at the international level. Therefore, we consider the agreement a success, even though it has been modified from its initial design, and it is sufficient to achieve the goal of decarbonizing the maritime sector by 2050. Have the GHG reduction targets been made too flexible over the many years of debate? The study I conducted for the IMO aimed to measure the impact of this pricing mechanism, because if we try to accelerate decarbonization beyond market capacity, we will see very strong consequences, especially in developing countries. A more rigid goal is not appropriate. Do you believe the agreement will be approved in October as it was designed, despite the US opposing the measure? Yes. The US will try to influence the matter, but there is considerable support for the measures. They have already been widely debated in recent years. Is the mechanism, as it progressed in the April meetings, economically viable for the entire maritime chain to adapt? The agreement will impact countries very differently. We were careful to assess the impacts on food inflation and the potential impact on malnutrition in developing countries. There will be socioeconomic impacts, so the measures needed to be gradual, as they will be. For example, there needs to be time for ships to be retrofitted, investment in technical measures to increase efficiency, and fuel replacement. Another point is that port technology needs to be adapted. Therefore, the mechanism should begin pricing in 2028, with reduction targets ranging from a modest 4-17pc for the first year. In any case, the sector will have to adapt, because the agreement will be effective in punishing those who do not comply. This agreement will work. The IMO is an institution with the capacity to effectively monitor and punish, and there are mechanisms in place to do so. How much is expected to be raised from the carbon pricing? The revenue generation potential, as it stands today, is $1bn/yr in the initial years, with a growth trend in subsequent years. This revenue is intended to mitigate the socioeconomic impacts of the mechanism on small island nations and developing countries.

Overview of Air Travel’s Environmental Impact

Air travel is essential for connecting people and goods but has significant environmental impacts. The aviation industry contributes 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, a figure likely to rise with increased travel. Additionally, aviation fuel combustion releases greenhouse gases like nitrogen oxides, exacerbating climate change. Other environmental effects include noise pollution, habitat disruption, and resource depletion from aircraft manufacturing and maintenance.

The Urgency of Addressing Carbon Emissions

As climate change worsens, reducing carbon emissions is crucial. The IPCC stresses the need for significant cuts in greenhouse gases across all sectors, including transportation, to keep global warming below 1.5°C. Being aware of our carbon footprint, especially when flying, is vital for sustainability. Each flight adds to environmental damage, and informed travel choices can contribute to meaningful climate action.

Taking Action: Simple Steps to Reduce Your Environmental Footprint

While the challenge of climate change can seem daunting, small actions, when taken collectively, can lead to substantial progress. Here are practical steps that travelers can adopt to reduce their environmental impact:

Choose Alternative Transport: For shorter distances, consider taking trains or buses, which typically have a lower carbon footprint compared to flying.

Opt for Direct Flights: If air travel is necessary, select direct flights over connecting ones. Takeoffs and landings are fuel-intensive, so reducing these stages helps cut emissions.

Travel Light: Packing less reduces the weight of the aircraft, improving fuel efficiency and reducing fuel consumption.

Support Sustainable Airlines: Choose airlines that prioritize sustainability and have initiatives like carbon offset programs or investments in fuel-efficient aircraft.

Offset Your Carbon Emissions: Consider purchasing carbon offsets for your flights, which fund renewable energy, reforestation, and other projects that help neutralize the emissions generated by your air travel.

Be Mindful of Frequency: Assess the necessity of each trip. Could a meeting be conducted virtually instead? Reducing the frequency of flights can significantly lower overall emissions.

Advocate for Change: Support policies and initiatives that promote sustainable aviation and invest in research for greener technologies. Encouraging systemic change amplifies individual efforts.

By adopting these practices, travelers can contribute to a collective effort toward more sustainable air travel, supporting the fight against climate change.

Understanding Your Carbon Footprint in Air Travel

What is a Carbon Footprint?

A carbon footprint measures the total greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2, produced by an individual, organization, or activity. In the context of air travel, this refers to the emissions associated with flights.

Air Travel Emissions

Compared to other modes of transportation, air travel is far more carbon intensive. The carbon footprint of a flight varies depending on factors like flight distance (short, medium, or long) and the type of aircraft.

Emission Estimates:

Short-Haul Flights: Typically result in more emissions per kilometer traveled, as takeoffs and landings consume a disproportionate amount of fuel.

Long-Haul Flights: While these flights may cover greater distances, they can sometimes be more fuel-efficient per passenger due to sustained cruising altitudes.

Why Corporate Travelers Should Care

Businesses play a crucial role in combating climate change through sustainable travel practices. By implementing eco-friendly policies, companies can reduce their carbon footprint, enhance their reputation, and gain a competitive advantage as clients expect responsible practices.

How to Offset Your Carbon Footprint

Understanding Carbon Offsetting

Carbon offsetting involves investing in projects that reduce or capture carbon emissions, such as reforestation or renewable energy projects, to balance out the emissions generated by your travel.

Carbon Offset Programs

Numerous carbon offset programs are available through airlines, third-party platforms, and environmental organizations. When choosing a provider, look for transparency, certification, and measurable impact to ensure your investment leads to tangible emissions reductions.

Sustainable Airline Choices

Many airlines are now adding sustainability programs to their operations. They invest in fuel-efficient planes and start carbon offset programs. Choosing airlines with good sustainability practices can help lower your environmental impact.

Practical Tips for Reducing Your Carbon Footprint While Traveling

Flying Direct vs. Connecting Flights: Direct flights are more fuel-efficient since takeoffs and landings are the most fuel-intensive stages of air travel.

Pack Light: Reducing luggage weight can improve fuel efficiency, leading to lower carbon emissions.

Choose Economy Class: Flying economy class reduces your carbon footprint per passenger, as it allows more people to share the flight’s total emissions.

Emerging Technologies in Sustainable Aviation

As a traveler, there is only so much you can do with the options available to you. The positive is that the travel industry is aware of its impact on the climate and is actively working on new technology to help lessen its impact on the world. Some key new ways airlines are taking initiative:

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

SAF is an alternative to conventional jet fuel, made from renewable resources, that has the potential to significantly reduce aviation emissions. As SAF becomes more widely adopted, it could play a major role in making air travel more sustainable.

Electric Aircraft

Electric planes are still being developed. They could change the aviation industry by removing emissions from short regional flights.

Advanced Aircraft Designs

Next-generation aircraft are being designed for better fuel efficiency, utilizing lightweight materials, improved aerodynamics, and more efficient engines, all of which reduce overall emissions.

Mike Berners-Lee is the author of A Climate of Truth: Why we need it and how to get it","To fly or not to fly? That is the question environmentally conscious people are increasingly grappling with. Sometimes taking the plane seems the only viable option, perhaps when time is tight or when a loved one lives far away.

I think we can have some flying as part of a sustainable future – but only if we put a few misleading myths to rest and instead lay out some realistic opportunities to cut its impact on global warming.

The first myth is that so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) can solve the problem. It is a complete misnomer, as SAF turns out not to be sustainable at all.

Here’s why. There are three main types of SAF. The first is fuel from waste products, especially cooking oil. The problem is, the whole world’s waste cooking oil supply would be enough to power only 2 to 3 per cent of flights. The second is synthetic SAF, produced from raw materials such as captured carbon dioxide using energy from renewable sources. The process involved is so inefficient (at least 2 kilowatt-hours of electricity input per 1 kWh of fuel generated) that it is a self-defeating use of our limited renewable power. The third type of SAF is created from crops, so needs a lot of farmland. The detrimental pressure that this puts on both our food system and on nature is a big problem. The hard reality is that sustainable aviation fuel really isn’t a “game changer”.

The next piece of wishful thinking I often come across is that we can decarbonise aviation through electrification or by using hydrogen as a fuel. Electrification will be practical only for short-haul flights because the weight of batteries renders it unworkable for long-haul operations. Hydrogen is tricky because it takes up so much space, even when compressed to 700 times atmospheric pressure. This means it needs to be stored in large, pressurised cylinders, making it unfeasibly bulky compared with liquid fuels.

The good news is that I also see some clear opportunities that aren’t getting enough attention.

The closest thing we have to an elusive silver bullet to make aviation greener has flown under the radar until very recently. Contrails – those high, cloud-like streaks left by aircraft engine exhaust fumes – account for over 60 per cent of the climate change impact of all our flights, and much more if you look at the short-term impacts over, say, 20 years.

They do this by reflecting heat released at Earth’s surface back down, acting like a blanket. But the overall impact of a contrail is complex. Not only do they trap Earth’s radiant heat, but on a sunny day they can have a cooling effect by reflecting incoming sun rays. This happens only in the daytime, and they cool most when contrails are above a darker surface, such as an ocean. The more frequent, warming effect happens most at night when they occur over warm, dark surfaces.

It is possible to manage contrails by making small tweaks to flight paths: taking a plane above, below or around a specific pocket of weather that will cause them to form. When flying over a sunny ocean, it may even be an advantage to deliberately create them. Small tweaks to just 1.7 per cent of all flight paths could have the effect of cutting the contrail warming impact by nearly 60 per cent. All that is required is some real-time modelling built into the flight path calculation, and no more flexibility than is already routinely applied to avoid storms and other aircraft.

It is a relatively cheap solution, one that just needs the aviation industry to get behind it. Once contrail management is in place, there may even be a role for SAF, as it burns more cleanly and could be used to mitigate contrails on the worst-offending flights.

Does this mean we can all relax about the climate impact of flying? Sadly not. But it might help us continue to fly when we have a good enough reason to do so.

Neste will supply 7,400 tonnes of neat SAF at Singapore Changi Airport from July 2025 to July 2026.

In line with plans to decarbonise its operations, DHL Express has agreed a year-long sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) supply at Singapore Changi Airport.

The CORSIA-eligible fuel is being supplied by SAF produced locally at Neste’s refinery in Singapore.

The deal marks one of Asia’s largest SAF deals by volume in the air cargo sector. It is also one of the largest SAF agreements purchased by DHL in Asia-Pacific and marks the company’s first direct purchase of SAF for flights between Singapore, Asia and the Americas.

Carly Nyberg, senior vice president, commercial, renewable products at Neste said: “the agreement leverages SAF production and supply capabilities in Singapore.”

He also noted it “demonstrates how Neste is working with DHL globally to help the company achieve its air transportation decarbonisation targets using a solution that is available at scale today.”

How will the SAF be used?

Neste’s MY SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. The SAF, which can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel, reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle.

The blended fuel will be delivered into Changi Airport’s fuel distribution facilities using the Neste’s integrated supply chain from its Singapore refinery.

The fuel will account for up to 40% of the overall fuel blend composition and will be used to refuel DHL Express’ five Boeing 777 freighters based at DHL’s South Asia Hub at Changi. The freighters currently depart from the airport 12 times a week.

Describing the agreement as a “significant milestone,” Christopher Ong, DHL Express Singapore’s managing director, said, it will “enable us to gain new strides in emissions reduction in air transport.” It will also allow customers to benefit from more sustainable shipping options.

“As one of the largest users of SAF globally, DHL Express is leading the way towards more sustainable logistics and driving voluntary demand for SAF adoption,” Ong added. “We’re not just meeting the industry standards but setting them.”

How much SAF does Neste’s Singapore refinery produce?

Neste’s Singapore presence started in 2007 when it announced plans to build the world’s largest renewable diesel refinery in the country. The facility originally opened in 2010, with expansion plans revealed in 2018 to double the facility.

The €1.6 billion investment in its Singapore refinery provided Neste with additional production capabilities. In addition to renewable diesel and renewable feedstock for polymers and chemicals, production capabilities for SAF were introduced when the expanded facility opened in 2023.

The refinery’s total production capacity currently stands at to 2.6 million tonnes of fuel annually. This includes up to one million tonnes of SAF.

The SAF supplied to DHL will contribute to Singapore’s SAF mandate. From 2026, all airlines departing from the country will be required to use SAF, with a 1% target uplift initially. This will rise to 3-5% by 2030.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DHL.jpg,N,,2025-07-16 13:21:21.991839

The Dawn of a New Fuel: Green Diesel's Ascendant Market

The green diesel market is experiencing a period of unprecedented expansion, driven by a global imperative to mitigate climate change and enhance energy security. Unlike traditional biodiesel, green diesel is a hydrocarbon produced through advanced hydrotreating processes, making it a ""drop-in"" fuel that requires no engine or infrastructure modifications. This critical advantage is fueling its rapid adoption across the transportation sector. The primary impetus for this growth stems from robust government policies, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in the United States and the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II), which mandate the blending of renewable fuels. The increasing shift toward sustainable energy is a core driver for the market's future. Corporate sustainability pledges and the financial incentives created by Low Carbon Fuel Standards (LCFS) and carbon credit programs are further accelerating market penetration, creating a powerful economic case for both producers and consumers of this cleaner alternative fuel. This confluence of regulatory pressure, corporate responsibility, and technological readiness has set the stage for a significant scaling of the green diesel industry through 2025 and beyond.

Titans of the Tank: Profiling Green Diesel's Production Heavyweights

The green diesel market is led by a cadre of established energy giants and specialized biofuel producers who are aggressively expanding their production capabilities. Neste Oyj, a Finnish company, stands as a global leader, reporting substantial revenues of USD 21,601.1 million in 2024. In the United States, Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), a joint venture between Valero Energy and Darling Ingredients, is a dominant force with a total annual production capacity of 1.2 billion gallons across its two facilities. The DGD plant in Norco, Louisiana, alone boasts a capacity of 982 million gallons per year. In the first quarter of 2024, DGD's sales volumes averaged 3.7 million gallons per day, generating an operating income of $190 million. Phillips 66 is another key U.S. player, having expanded its Rodeo, California, plant to a capacity of 800 million gallons in 2024, making it the second-largest facility of its kind in the country. Chevron Corporation also remains a leading producer, with its renewables division contributing to the company's strong Q4 2024 earnings of $3.2 billion. Meanwhile, Repsol of Spain made waves in October 2024 by launching ""Nexa,"" its brand of 100% renewable diesel, directly at its service stations.

Unveiling 2025's Most Promising Startup Ventures

Beyond the established players, a new wave of innovative startups and targeted investment is broadening the horizons of the green diesel market. In Nebraska, the Love's Heartwell Renewables plant is on schedule to commence operations in 2025, adding 80 million gallons of annual capacity to the U.S. supply. Demonstrating the rapid pace of development, New Rise Renewables began its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in Reno, Nevada, in February 2025, with a capacity to produce up to 3,000 barrels per day. In a significant technological adoption, Acelen Renewables announced in 2024 its use of Honeywell's advanced Ecofining technology, targeting a production of 20,000 barrels per day of both renewable diesel and SAF. A notable investment in Canada's growing market comes from Imperial Oil, an ExxonMobil affiliate, which is investing around $560 million to construct the nation's largest renewable diesel facility; this plant is expected to start producing 20,000 barrels per day in 2025. Highlighting the emergence of novel production pathways, Swiss cleantech firm Synhelion, which creates fuel from solar energy, is poised to enter the market, backed by key offtake agreements.

Charting Worldwide Green Diesel Production Volumes

Global production in the green diesel market is surging, with the United States taking a decisive lead in capacity expansion. U.S. renewable diesel production capacity was forecast to hit an impressive 5.1 billion gallons per year by the end of 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected that daily production would average 209,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, with a forecast to rise to an average of 234,000 bpd in 2025. This forms part of a larger trend that saw total U.S. biofuels production, including ethanol and other biofuels, reach a record 1.39 million barrels per day in 2024. The expansion in renewable diesel was a significant contributor to this record. Despite the strong annual growth, the market experienced some short-term headwinds, with U.S. production dipping to an average of 170,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2025, a 12% decrease from the same quarter in the previous year, partly due to profitability challenges. Meanwhile, in Europe, which holds a significant share of the global market, local demand remains robust, with the region consuming more than 95% of its own green diesel production in 2025.

From Farm to Fuel Tank: The Diverse Feedstocks Powering Green Diesel

The viability and sustainability of the green diesel market hinge on a diverse and resilient feedstock supply chain. Currently, the industry relies heavily on readily available fats, oils, and greases. The most common inputs include recycled animal fats (tallow), used cooking oil, inedible corn oil, and various vegetable oils. These materials are processed to create high-quality fuel that is chemically similar to petroleum diesel. Looking ahead, the industry is actively expanding its feedstock options to enhance supply chain resilience and reduce competition with food production. Significant research and development efforts are focused on so-called second and third-generation feedstocks. These include lignocellulosic biomass, such as wood, agricultural grasses, and crop residues, which are abundant and do not impact the food supply. Other promising future sources include municipal solid waste and forest residues, which support the principles of a circular economy by valorizing waste streams. Feedstock certification frameworks like the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) are becoming crucial for ensuring transparency and traceability.

Tapping into Third-Generation Biofuel Potential in 2025

Among the next wave of feedstocks, algae is generating significant excitement as a potential game-changer for the green diesel market. Considered a third-generation feedstock, algae can be cultivated on non-arable land and can utilize wastewater or saltwater, minimizing competition for land and freshwater resources. Many species of microalgae are particularly promising due to their high lipid oil content, which can range from 20% to as high as 50% of their biomass, making them an ideal raw material for biofuel production. The global market for algae-based green diesel is already gaining traction, reflecting the growing investment in this area. However, scaling up production to commercial levels faces hurdles. Techno-economic analyses conducted in 2025, based on future productivity targets, indicate a high minimum fuel selling price, estimated at 2.2 €/L for fuels produced via lipid extraction and 3.4 €/L for those produced via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Overcoming these cost barriers through continued research and technological advances in cultivation, harvesting, and processing will be key to unlocking algae's full potential.

Nations Leading the Green Diesel Charge

A handful of nations are at the forefront of the green diesel market revolution, driven by ambitious climate policies and strategic investments. The United States currently leads the world in production capacity, with 22 operational renewable diesel plants as of January 2024 and a projected capacity of 5.1 billion gallons per year by the year's end. In Europe, which collectively accounts for a major share of the global market, countries like Germany, France, and the Netherlands are notable leaders. Their progress is underpinned by strong policy frameworks, particularly the EU's Renewable Energy Directive, which mandates a greater share of renewables in transport. Finland is also a key player, home to the pioneering global producer Neste. To the north, Canada is making significant strides, highlighted by Imperial Oil's $507 million investment in a renewable diesel facility in Alberta, set to come online in 2025. Brazil is another nation showing increasing interest, with a focus on developing its capacity through the adoption of advanced hydrotreating technology to leverage its vast agricultural resources for fuel production.

The Technological Vanguard, Innovations Driving Green Diesel Production Forward

Technological advancement is the engine powering the scalability and cost-competitiveness of the green diesel market. The dominant production method is hydrotreating, also known as Hydroprocessed Vegetable Oil (HVO), a process where renewable feedstocks react with hydrogen under high temperature and pressure. This technology creates a ""drop-in"" fuel that is chemically indistinguishable from petroleum diesel. Leading technology providers like Honeywell offer specialized solutions, such as their Ecofining™ process, which was adopted by Acelen Renewables in 2024 for a large-scale project. Following the core hydrotreating step, additional processes like hydrocracking and isomerization are often employed. Hydrocracking breaks down larger molecules to improve fuel efficiency, while isomerization rearranges molecular structures to enhance performance in cold weather. Beyond HVO, researchers and companies are developing other pathways, including catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP), which shows great promise for converting solid lignocellulosic biomass into refinable bio-oil, a key focus of research in 2024.

Sealing the Deal: Key Distribution Pacts and Offtake Agreements of 2024

The growing acceptance of green diesel market is clearly reflected in the increasing number of significant distribution and offtake agreements announced in 2024. These deals are crucial for guaranteeing demand for producers and securing a stable supply of low-carbon fuel for end-users. In a landmark deal for the aviation sector announced in July 2024, Diamond Green Diesel committed to supplying an initial 1 million gallons of neat sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to World Fuel Services for use by JetBlue at New York's JFK Airport, with an option for 4 million additional gallons. In ground transport, Colonial Oil partnered with Neste in February 2024 to significantly boost the availability of renewable diesel in Savannah, Georgia, and the wider southeastern U.S. European aviation is also advancing, with low-cost carrier easyJet signing a memorandum of understanding with Spanish energy company Moeve in late 2024 for SAF supply on key Spanish routes from 2025 through 2030. Highlighting innovation, Zurich Airport Ltd. signed a pioneering offtake agreement in December 2024 with Synhelion to purchase 30,000 liters of solar-generated diesel annually starting in 2027 for use in its ground vehicle fleet.

The Road Ahead: How 2025 Policies are Shaping Market Acceptance

The trajectory of the green diesel market into 2025 and beyond is intrinsically linked to the strength and stability of government policies and corporate commitments. Regulatory frameworks like the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) have been instrumental in creating the initial demand and investment security for the industry. Similarly, in Europe, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) has accelerated the adoption of green diesel by mandating its inclusion in the transport fuel mix. The growing demand is not purely policy-driven; corporations are increasingly adopting green diesel to meet their own sustainability targets and reduce their carbon footprint. This is especially true for hard-to-abate sectors like heavy-duty trucking and aviation, which see green diesel and SAF as one of the most viable, immediate pathways to decarbonization. As of 2025, the synergy between robust regulatory mandates, financial incentives from carbon markets, and a proactive corporate sector has created a fertile ground for the continued, rapid expansion of the green diesel market.

The NovaSAF 1 facility will convert dairy waste and biogas into drop-in jet fuel with a nameplate capacity of 500,000 gallons annually, using only renewable electricity and waste gas—no green hydrogen, no complex gasification.

At the heart of the project is Syzygy's light-driven GHG e-Reforming technology, which produces the ideal 2:1 syngas ratio for Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis directly from biogenic methane and CO₂. This breakthrough eliminates the need for water-intensive steam reforming or expensive electrolyzers, radically simplifying the SAF value chain.

To convert that syngas into high-yield jet fuel, Syzygy has selected Velocys and its microFTL technology, known for reliability and for maximizing fuel output, both critical factors in driving down the total cost required to produce synthetic fuel.

""This project proves that profitable SAF production doesn't have to wait on future infrastructure,"" said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. ""With Velocys, we're bringing in a complete, modular solution that drives down overall production costs and is ready to scale. Uruguay is only the start.""

""We're proud to bring our FT technology into a project that's changing the game,"" said Matthew Viergutz, CEO of Velocys. ""This is what innovation looks like—fast, flexible, and focused on making SAF production affordable.""

NovaSAF 1 Project Highlights:

Nameplate Capacity: 500,000 gallons/year of ASTM D7566-compliant SAF

Feedstocks: Dairy waste, biogenic methane, and CO₂

We think that roughly half of that 50% will need the revenue certainty mechanism.
That does not need the revenue certainty mechanism because we at IAG are providing the company with a long-term committed take-or-pay offer.

Q Yes—I recognise that there are a lot of benefits of SAF, but I am wondering how the Bill can help that along.

Gaynor Hartnell: I think it is worth mentioning some of the environmental benefits specifically of producing SAF in the UK. They are focused on the second generation—that is, SAF that comes from waste. We have problematic waste to deal with in the UK, and it is better in terms of the proximity principle if we deal with our own waste domestically. There are various different feedstocks that the SAF mandate is seeking to encourage that have not traditionally been used, so it is aiming to expand the feedstocks to things such as end-of-life tyres. We currently export a lot of that waste to India, and we have heard in the news about the devastating environmental and health impacts that that has. If we deal with our own waste domestically, that is an environmental benefit; we will import somewhat less, but the aviation fuel we use at the moment is largely imported.

The main benefits of producing the SAF in this country are economic. The Government have realised that and they support it as part of their growth agenda, which it plays to.

Paul Greenwood: To round that out, if you listen to Rob’s comments, which I thought were very insightful, about the complexity of this and the need to ensure you get the right projects, with the right feedstock, at the right size and with the right basis, that to my mind is classic market distortion. Fundamentally, you are intervening in a market and saying, “I’m going to decide what is going to happen in this marketplace and I’m going to incentivise it to happen with a tariff.” The best way to do that is effectively to set a very clear demand signal, which happens through the SAF mandate, and let the market go and work that.

I do not buy into this idea that the market is incapable of supplying second-generation SAF; I had breakfast this morning—not because I was coming here today—with an Asian supplier who I deal with, who let me know that they had taken a final investment decision on a second-generation SAF plant in Asia that will be starting up in 2028. These things are happening; the market is responding. You are deliberately intervening in the marketplace with very good intentions, but it will distort that market signal. There is no doubt about it.

Mr Paul Kohler (Wimbledon) (LD) - Hansard - -

Q Mr Greenwood has made a compelling critique of the basics—“We have a mandate; why do we need the RCM? There might be unintended consequences.” I know you disagree with him, but I would like to hear why you disagree with him.

Gaynor Hartnell: These projects are first of a kind, pretty much. This waste-based stuff is not being produced at scale anywhere in the world yet. It is very challenging to build one of these projects. There are numerous risks. You have Philip New coming later to give evidence; he has written a report on that, so you could ask him what those risks are. This addresses the showstopper risk if you like, which is the revenue certainty that a SAF producer can rely on when going to a bank and asking to borrow the millions or billions of pounds that it costs to build one of these projects.

In the UK, we now have many precedents of other large-scale projects that are driven by environmental requirements, from renewable electricity generation to carbon capture and storage. Those various different projects are all supported by some sort of equivalent to the contracts that will be let under this revenue certainty mechanism, whether it is a contract for difference for electricity or whatever. It is par for the course. We are not asking for this just because everyone else gets it so we should get it too. There is a competition for capital, among other things. If there are supported projects in terms of revenue stability, it will be easier for the capital to flow to those projects. This is a new mechanism. We are seeking new types of SAF production pathways. It is incredibly complex, and it is necessary.

Underlying all of this, the SAF mandate creates a market for greenhouse gas certificates, and the price of those certificates will be variable. It is very much built on a preceding policy—the renewable transport fuel obligation for road transport. That was just a demand mechanism without any accompanying equivalent to this revenue certainty mechanism. We import 85% of our road fuels, and we are not doing a very good job, I must say, given the opportunity, at preserving those early movers of projects that were built in the early days. Getting project funding is challenging, and it is not made easier by the fact that we have some early movers that are not managing to keep their renewable fuel projects going. I am talking about the bioethanol producers.

Rob Griggs: I agree with what Gaynor says. Ultimately, UK SAF projects are competing for investment against other renewable projects across the UK economy that have similar types of support—CFDs for energy and hydrogen and other types of things. In some way it is levelling the playing field a little for SAF compared with other forms.

I am here representing airlines; I am not representing producers. We want and we need SAF, and we want it as cost effectively as possible. We have seen all the evidence, given the nature of our mandate, its design, the global market and the work of Phil New that Gaynor referenced, which specifically asked that question: you have a mandate; why do you need an RCM? Everything suggests that given all those dynamics, without some form of revenue certainty you will not get that investment in the first-of-a-kind plants that we need to prove out the technology and get that initial set of volumes on a really aggressive timeline for 2030.

As airlines, on balance, we want the system to be competitive. We expect there to be imports as well as domestic production, but we think that without that UK 2G supply kick-started by the RCM, we will struggle and then we risk the buy-out. That is why we support it. On top of that, if it goes right, you get a UK industry better for your security, and jobs domiciled in the UK. It is a win-win, notwithstanding that as airlines, that is not necessarily our primary goal, but it is a huge benefit, so why not support it?

Alice Macdonald - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q I want to pick up on the monitoring point. For example, say a consumer feels that they have had to pay a little more for a flight that is more environmentally friendly; how soon would you be able to quantify whether that mechanism had had an effect? In a year’s time, would you be able to say that it has meant that the carbon has been decreased by x amount?

Jonathon Counsell: Definitely. All SAF has to be independently assessed for its life cycle emission savings. Before we purchased it, we have to prove that, and as I said, get an independent authority to test the life cycle emissions. We will be able to declare publicly, of any SAF that we use, the independent assessment of its life cycle savings.

Lahiru Ranasinghe: If you look at the mechanics of how it works for meeting the mandate, there is a minimum threshold that we set when buying compliant fuel. In this case, compliant fuel is kerosene: fossil-based kerosene blended with SAF. When we pay for the supply, we get the product transfer documents, which have the sustainability criteria associated with that specific batch of SAF. At that point we can very accurately calculate the emissions saving. In terms of planning, we have to set a range, because there is some variation depending on the pathway and the SAF provided. Building on what my colleagues here have said, there is an opportunity for the UK both in home-grown production and up and down the value chain in the development and export of the technology and the financing and trading of SAF in the longer term. We have what is seen as a gold standard for sustainability criteria, especially going to 2G SAF and the conversion of waste into usable fuels, which addresses multiple issues at the same time and is something that we can export to the rest of the world.

Mr Kohler - Hansard - -

Q To your point on the RCM, the money you put into the RCM will bring down your overall costs, because the premium on SAF will go down, will it not?

Jonathon Counsell: Absolutely—we hope that eventually, as you scale up SAF supply, the cost will come down. Will it ever come down to jet fuel levels? I do not think it will, because of the factor cost element. I agree with Paul Greenwood, who said earlier that one of the disadvantages we have in this country is high energy costs. We are doing SAF contracts with SAF suppliers in the US, where their energy costs are one third of those in this country, so we are at a disadvantage.

On 2G SAF, however, I think we have some real advantages: we have some sites, we have expertise and we have feedstock, both waste biomass and municipal solid waste. We put 20 million tonnes of municipal solid waste into landfill; we even ship 5 million tonnes of it to Europe. That is energy. We should be using it to make SAF. Those advantages can overcome the energy disadvantage in the short term. Hopefully we will sort out that energy disadvantage, but as we scale up those plants that SAF price should come down. It is an investment, but we do not want to double-pay for it.

Luke Ervine: Just to add and clarify, I think Luke Taylor asked a question earlier about ways to pay for the SAF mandate. We have always been very clear about paying twice through things such as the ETS scheme. We would love to see those revenues used to reinvest in the decarbonisation of the aviation industry. Given the economic value it returns and the Government’s growth agenda, we believe that creating a SAF industry also creates jobs and a lot of economic prosperity. The Sustainable Aviation report in 2023 estimated that the UK SAF industry would create about 60,000 new jobs by 2050 and about £10 billion gross value added by the same time. There is a benefit here for the UK economy as a whole purely in terms of the SAF industry, and using some of the taxes we currently pay to fund the RCM would be very helpful.

Lahiru Ranasinghe: I do not have much to add to what has already been said, but the cost of SAF means that the cost of fuel will go up in the long run, even with the RCM. In our minds, the RCM is something that unlocks production, as opposed to something that brings the cost down. The primary role we see for it is in getting production up so that supply can meet demand in the short run. Ultimately, though, we will have higher costs because of SAF, especially as eSAF and power-to-liquid comes in, and those costs will have to be passed through.

We are doing a huge amount to try to be as efficient as we possibly can; that is where the investments in aircraft and how we operate come in. As they say, the best energy is the energy you do not use, and in that way we are trying to manage our costs in the same way we have for the past 30 years, but I completely agree that we have to be wary of adding on to the costs we are already paying in the name of sustainability, both right now and in terms of meeting the mandates.

Lewis Atkinson (Sunderland Central) (Lab) - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Building on the point Mr Ervine made about the potential wider economic contribution of SAF, I am particularly interested in the jobs. We have heard that 70% of existing fuel is imported, and therefore a significant part of your economic supply chain is essentially providing economic benefit overseas. Could you say a little more about—if we get this off the ground, as it were—how far you think that value chain and economic benefit will shift into the UK from imports? In particular, could you talk about the potential regional economic benefits of SAF, as opposed to being concentrated on London and the south-east?

Jonathon Counsell: From our modelling and analysis, we still want to have the flexibility to import SAF, because there is a global market there and we do not want to put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage by saying that all mandated SAF has to be produced in the UK. We still want access to imported SAF, particularly 1G SAF; we do not think the UK has much competitive advantage in producing 1G SAF. We think roughly 50% feels about right, and you have to compare it around that. Our view is that, of the mandated SAF, approximately 50% should be produced here in the UK—but, as I said earlier, not all of that will need the revenue certainty mechanism.

One of the key points that I want to make is that the revenue certainty mechanism is for those plants that cannot get funding: they are early stage, first-of-their-kind technology, and cannot get tracker funding because it is perceived to be too high risk by the investment market, and they cannot get that revenue certainty through any other mechanism, so therefore they rely on this mechanism. We think that roughly half of that 50% will need the revenue certainty mechanism.

A good example is LanzaJet in Teesside, the speedboat project that I mentioned earlier. That does not need the revenue certainty mechanism because we at IAG are providing the company with a long-term committed take-or-pay offer. We are giving the revenue certainty to LanzaJet, so that project does not need it; but other projects do, typically including the municipal solid waste projects that take black bag waste. They are at a very early stage, using less mature technology, and they are massively capital intense projects. They definitely need the revenue certainty mechanism, so we must ensure that it is targeted.

As Luke said, we think that by 2030 there could potentially be 10,000 extra jobs in the UK from that UK production. We can share a piece of analysis that we did through Sustainable Aviation that showed what that looks like for each region of the UK. We think there is certainly potential to build plants in Wearside, Teesside, Humberside and south Wales; if we get the policy right, we think there could be up to 14 plants within the next 10 years, which will deliver £1.8 billion in GVA by 2030.

However, the big prize will come in 2050: 60,000 jobs and £10 billion in GVA. We are creating a new energy industry for the UK. I have to congratulate the Government: we have potentially the most powerful package of SAF policy in the world, with the mandate, the revenue certainty mechanism and the advanced fuels fund. Taken together, they mean that we are the envy of the world and we have a huge chance to be a world leader on SAF production.

Lahiru Ranasinghe: To add to that, it would also enable UK aviation to grow. Our estimates are that each aircraft based in the UK supports around 400 jobs and £27 million of GVA. We have over 150 aircraft in the UK as it is, we have three aircraft going to a new base in Newcastle shortly and we absolutely intend to continue with the growth in the UK. By having the RCM unlock SAF production and SAF supply, that opens the doors to us to continue growing, while also decarbonising. That is a massive part of the economic benefit that the RCM helps to unlock, beyond the obvious effects of supporting jobs and production on the ground in the SAF industry.

Luke Ervine: Just to add a note on benefits, it is important to recognise the cost of not having the RCM. We have spoken a lot today about the buy-out. The UK is unique in its ambition to have a 2G SAF mandate, so the cost of not having the RCM is important. If we do not have it, we pay buy-out, and then we are going to lose out regionally to other areas, such as Europe and the US, that do not have those 2G SAF mandates, so it is important that we recognise that there is a cost of not having the RCM.",https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/static/UK_Parliament/img/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-16 13:21:38.995853

Swedish group Sandvik mitigates impact of tariffs

Stockholm — Swedish metal-cutting and mining equipment engineering group Sandvik reported a bigger-than-expected drop in second-quarter core profit on Wednesday but said it had fully mitigated the effect of tariffs in the period.

Operating profit before amortisation and items affecting comparability fell 8% from a year earlier to 5.63bn kronor ($577m), against a mean forecast of 5.86bn in an LSEG poll of analysts.

“We will continue to take mitigating actions to limit the effect of new trade policies if and when they become reality,” CEO Stefan Widing said in a statement.

The company has said it would be able to increase production capacity in its US facilities. It had more than 14% of group revenue in the US last year. Reuters

Total’s hydrocarbon production in the second quarter of 2025 will show an increase of around 2.5% year-on-year, it said.

But a 20% drop in the Brent crude price — from $85 per barrel a year ago to $67.9 per barrel in the second quarter of 2025 — means earnings for upstream will be lower.

Last week BP flagged lower oil and gas sales, while Shell warned of lower gas trading earnings and a hit to its downstream chemicals business. Reuters

EU’s sustainable aviation fuel mandate under fire

Singapore — The International Air Transport Association on Wednesday stepped up criticism of the EU’s sustainable aviation fuel mandate as a costly initiative that is not helping the environment as regional supplies there remain low.

“The idea that you’re buying sustainable fuel and then transporting it to use in Europe isn’t the right way to do it, because you’re clearly increasing the carbon footprint of that fuel as a result of the transportation costs,” IATA’s director-general Willie Walsh said at a media round-table in Singapore.

IATA estimated in June that production of SAF, which is considered a low-carbon replacement for traditional jet fuel, is expected to reach 2-million metric tons, or 0.7% of airlines’ fuel consumption, in 2025.

“Mandating the use of a product that isn’t available doesn’t lead to any environmental benefit,” Walsh said, adding that fuel companies that have an obligation to produce SAF are also increasing the cost of traditional jet fuel. Reuters

Hybrid work models affecting Workspace

Bengaluru — London-focused flexible office-space provider Workspace reported on Wednesday a drop in quarterly occupancy, as larger customers vacated its properties, and warned that another major customer’s exit will lead to further decline in the second quarter.

Workspace has seen property valuations decline since the pandemic, as businesses ditched larger office spaces and opted for hybrid work models.

The company leased a monthly average of 93 new office spaces in the quarter, compared to 102 spaces in the prior year.

The company, which leases space to small businesses ranging from fintech firms to podcasters and people using AI to write music, said like-for-like occupancy dipped 0.3% to 82.2% in the first quarter.

Grains firmer overnight... Corn futures extended their recent corrective gains overnight, while soybeans and wheat rebounded. As of 6:30 a.m. CT, corn futures are trading 3 to 4 cents higher, soybeans are 7 to 8 cents higher, winter wheat markets are unchanged to a penny higher and spring wheat is around 3 cents higher. The U.S. dollar index is trading just below unchanged and front-month crude oil futures are around 50 cents lower.

U.S. formally opens tariff probe into Brazil... The Trump administration has launched a formal Section 301 investigation into Brazil’s trade practices, raising the threat of sweeping new tariffs and intensifying bilateral tensions. The probe, targets Brazil’s regulatory actions against American tech firms and broader policies that Washington says discriminate against U.S. companies and products. The investigation will examine a wide array of Brazilian measures, including: digital trade restrictions, ethanol market access, intellectual property enforcement, judicial interference, tariff and non-tariff barriers and environmental policies. President Donald Trump announced the U.S. will impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports starting Aug. 1, up from the prior 10%. The 50% tariff will severely impact key Brazilian sectors — beef, orange juice, coffee, steel, and drone components. The investigation could last several months and includes a public comment period. If Brazil is found to be harming U.S. commerce, the USTR could impose long-term tariffs or restrictions. Observers say further escalation is possible if no negotiated solution is reached.

Carney signals tariffs likely to stay, trade talks with U.S. to intensify... Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Tuesday that while trade negotiations with the U.S. are expected to “intensify,” there’s little indication that President Trump is prepared to lift sweeping tariffs. Carney underscored his focus on Canada’s industrial base, saying a strong economy “includes a strong steel industry… auto industry… aluminum industry, and copper industry.” The White House has said the threatened tariffs would not apply to USMCA-exempt goods, though Trump has increasingly sidestepped the accord with unilateral import taxes.

Mexico pledges ‘other actions’ if no deal with United States... Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Tuesday said Mexico will take action if an agreement with Washington regarding new tariffs is not reached by the Aug. 1 deadline set by Trump. “We hope to reach an agreement ... if an agreement is not reached on Aug. 1, we will be informing of other actions,” said Sheinbaum. She also hopes to announce measures next week in conjunction with tomato producers related to Washington’s announcement on Monday that it will begin charging a duty of 17.09% on imports of fresh tomatoes from Mexico. “We think we can reach a deal. But we have to prepare for every scenario... We have to have alternatives,” Sheibaum said.

Trump cuts Indonesia tariff to 19% in new deal... The Trump administration finalized a trade agreement with Indonesia, reducing the proposed tariff rate from 32% to 19% in exchange for $15 billion in U.S. energy purchases, $4.5 billion in agricultural imports, and an order for 50 Boeing jets. Trump also signaled that countries not negotiating tailored rates — mostly smaller U.S. trading partners — would likely face a flat tariff of “probably a little over 10%.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the nations with goods being taxed at these rates would be in Africa and the Caribbean — places that generally do relatively modest levels of trade with the U.S.

French wheat exports to more than double... In its first outlook for the 2025-26 season, France’s ag ministry forecasts French wheat exports outside the EU will jump 114% from last year’s historic low of 3.25 MMT to 7.5 MMT. French wheat exports within the bloc are forecast at 6.72 MMT, down 0.5% from 2024-25.

Australia nears breakthrough canola deal with China... Australia is close to an agreement with Beijing that would allow suppliers to ship five trial canola cargoes to China, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Chinese and Australian officials are finalizing a framework deal to address Beijing’s phytosanitary requirements aimed at preventing the spread of blackleg disease, according to two Australian ag industry sources briefed on the negotiations. China, the world’s largest canola importer, sources nearly all of its imports from Canada but those supplies could be limited by an anti-dumping probe Beijing is conducting. Australia, the second-largest canola exporter, has been shut out of the Chinese market since 2020.

IATA criticizes EU’s SAF mandate... The International Air Transport Association (IATA) stepped up criticism of the European Union’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate as a costly initiative that is not helping the environment as regional supplies remain low. IATA estimated in June that production of SAF, which is considered a low-carbon replacement for traditional jet fuel, is expected to reach 2 MMT, or 0.7% of airlines’ fuel consumption, in 2025. Under the ReFuelEU Aviation requirement, airlines need to have a 6% SAF blend in their jet fuel usage by 2030. “Mandating the use of a product that isn’t available doesn’t lead to any environmental benefit,” the head of IATA said, adding that fuel companies that have an obligation to produce SAF are also increasing the cost of traditional jet fuel. By IATA’s assessment, he said “the cost that they’re charging is way in excess of the actual cost of the limited supplies of sustainable fuel.”

Raizen shuts historic sugar mill to cut debt... Raizen SA, the world’s largest sugar producer, said it was shutting down for an indefinite period one of its largest plants in Brazil, the Santa Elisa mill, to help manage its 30 billion reais ($5.41 billion) debt. The company will sell 3.5 MMT of sugarcane to six firms, raising 1.045 billion reais ($188 million). The 90-year-old plant was key to Brazil’s ethanol program. Industry group CEISE Br warned the shutdown could disrupt equipment and service contracts. Raizen is also selling other assets as sugar prices hit a four-year low.

Texas braces for screwworm threat... Texas and federal officials are ramping up screwworm monitoring efforts as outbreaks in Mexico inch closer to the U.S. border, threatening the state’s $15 billion cattle industry. USDA and state labs, in partnership with Texas A&M, are deploying a five-point defense plan that includes border inspections, sterile fly releases and major facility upgrades. At a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing, lawmakers warned that a Texas infestation could cause up to $4.3 billion in producer losses annually, a total economic loss of over $10 billion and disrupt the national food supply.

Brazil beef exports to U.S. ‘under analysis’ after tariffs... Brazilian meatpackers are weighing whether to make new shipments of beef products to the U.S. after President Donald Trump announced a 50% tariff on Brazil last week, the president of Brazilian beef lobby ABIEC, said. Since Trump’s announcement, meatpackers have been scrambling to reschedule and redirect shipments and production, with some companies already deciding to temporarily halt production destined for the United States.

Cash hog index remains choppy... Since halting a pullback from the seasonal high, the CME lean hog index has alternated “up” and “down” days. The latest quote is down 6 cents to $107.19 as of July 14. August lean hog futures, which are now the lead-month contract, finished Tuesday at a $3.265 discount to today’s quote.

Overnight demand news... Taiwan purchased 89,650 MT of U.S. milling wheat. Jordan tendered to buy up to 120,000 MT of optional origin milling wheat. Thailand tendered to buy 60,000 MT of optional origin feed wheat.

The following is a summary of certain general business tax, clean energy tax credit and international tax provisions of the OBBBA. All section references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

General Business Tax

Bonus Depreciation (Section 168(k) and (n))

Permanence. The OBBBA permanently reinstates 100 percent bonus depreciation under Section 168(k) for qualified property acquired after January 19, 2025.

Qualified Production Property. New Section 168(n) allows an immediate deduction for 100 percent of the cost of “qualified production property.” Generally, qualified production property is any domestic manufacturing, refining, agricultural production or chemical production facility the construction of which begins after January 19, 2025 and before January 1, 2029 and that is placed in service after July 4, 2025 and before January 1, 2031.

Domestic Research and Experimental (R&E) Expenditures (Section 174A)

Domestic R&E. The OBBBA restores immediate expensing of domestic R&E expenditures under new Section 174A for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. This reverses the five-year amortization requirement that took effect in 2022 under the TCJA. Section 174A does not allow expensing of amounts paid or incurred for the purpose of ascertaining the existence, location, extent or quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral (including oil and gas).

Capitalization. Capitalization and amortization of domestic R&E expenditures remains available upon election.

Business Interest Limitation (Section 163(j))

EBITDA Calculation Reinstated. The OBBBA permanently returns the limitation on business interest deductibility to an EBITDA-based formula, reversing the more restrictive EBIT-based test in effect since 2022. This change takes effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Ordering. The OBBBA provides that the Section 163(j) limitation is calculated prior to applying any interest capitalization provisions (subject to certain exceptions) and requires taxpayers to first apply their allowed business interest deduction against business interest that would otherwise be capitalized. This change takes effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Expansion of Qualifying Income for Publicly Traded Partnerships (Section 7704)

Clean Energy Expansion. The OBBBA expands the definition of “qualifying income” under Section 7704 to include income from the transportation or storage of certain clean fuels, production of electricity from certain clean sources and other energy-transition infrastructure.

Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) (Section 56A)

Intangible Drilling and Development Costs. Corporate operators of oil and gas assets can reduce adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) by any deductions for intangible drilling and development costs allowed under Section 263(c) and, correspondingly, are required to include in AFSI any depletion expense reflected in their applicable financial statements with respect to such intangible drilling and development costs. This change is relevant for purposes of determining whether a corporate taxpayer is subject to CAMT and, if so, the extent of its CAMT liability for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Partnership Transactions (Section 707(a)(2))

Self-execution. The OBBBA confirms that Section 707(a)(2), which addresses disguised sales between partners and partnerships, is self-executing. This eliminates any ambiguity about the enforceability of the disguised sales rules with respect to disguised sales of partnership interests in the absence of final regulations.

Deduction for Qualified Business Income (Section 199A)

Permanence. The OBBBA makes permanent the 20 percent deduction for qualified business income.

Excess Business Loss Limitation (Section 461(l))

Permanence. The OBBBA makes permanent the limitation on excess business losses for noncorporate taxpayers, which was set to expire after 2028. Excess losses will continue to be converted into net operating losses carried forward to future years.

Qualified Opportunity Zones (QOZs) and Qualified Opportunity Funds (QOFs) (Subchapter Z)

QOZ Renewal. The OBBBA renews the QOZ program with new QOZ designations to be made on July 1, 2026 and each July 1st every 10 years thereafter. New QOZ designations will go into effect on January 1st of the year following the designation.

QOF Renewal. Similarly, new QOFs will be established with respect to newly designated QOZs. Investors in QOFs will be able to defer capital gains for up to five years. In addition, taxpayers will receive a partial basis step-up in their investment if their holding period is at least five years and recognize no gain if their holding period is between 10 and 30 years.

Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) Gain Exclusion (Section 1202)

Holding Period. Non-corporate taxpayers can exclude from taxable income gain on the disposition of QSBS if such stock was held for five years and certain other requirements are satisfied. The OBBBA changes the holding-period requirement for QSBS issued after July 4, 2025 to allow a 50 percent exclusion for QSBS held for three years, a 75 percent exclusion after four years and full exclusion after five years.

Cap Increases. For QSBS issued after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA increases the maximum gain that can be excluded from the disposition of QSBS of a single issuer from $10 million to $15 million. In addition, the maximum gross asset threshold for a C corporation to be a qualified small business increased from $50 million to $75 million. The increased amounts are indexed for inflation for subsequent years. These changes apply to QSBS issued after July 4, 2025.

Clean Energy Tax Credits

Clean Electricity Production and Investment Credits (Sections 45Y and 48E)

Wind and Solar. The OBBBA phases out the Section 45Y and 48E credits for wind and solar projects. Wind and solar projects that begin construction on or after July 5, 2026 must be placed in service by December 31, 2027 to qualify for the Section 45Y or 48E credit. Wind and solar projects that begin construction prior to July 5, 2026 are eligible for the Section 45Y or 48E credit under the rules that existed prior to the passage of the OBBBA.

Fuel Cells. The OBBBA adds qualified fuel cell property to the property eligible for the Section 48E credit at a 30 percent rate. Fuel cell projects are not subject to the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or the zero greenhouse gas emissions rate requirement. Fuel cell projects are not eligible for any credit adders.

Other Technologies. The OBBBA modifies the phase-out rules under Sections 45Y and 48E for non-wind and non-solar projects. For any such projects that begin construction in 2034 and 2035, the Section 45Y and 48E credits are subject to a 25 percent and 50 percent reduction, respectively. Any such projects that begin construction in 2036 or later will not qualify for the Section 45Y or 48E credit.

Domestic Content Adder. The OBBBA makes the domestic content percentage requirements under Section 48E consistent with those under Section 45Y for projects that begin construction on or after June 16, 2025. Prior to the passage of the OBBBA, the domestic content percentage requirement under Section 48E was 40 percent but under Section 45Y ranged from 40 percent to 55 percent depending on when construction began.

Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

Extension. The Section 45Z credit is extended by two years to include transportation fuel sold through December 31, 2029.

Feedstock. After December 31, 2025, transportation fuel must be exclusively derived from feedstock that is produced or grown in the United States, Mexico or Canada.

Emissions Rate. The emissions rate for a transportation fuel may not be less than zero; however, an exception allows negative emissions rates for fuels derived from animal manure. Further, the emissions rate shall be adjusted as necessary to exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use changes. Such amendments apply to emissions rates published for transportation fuel produced after December 31, 2025.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The value of the Section 45Z credit for sustainable aviation fuel is reduced from $1.75 to $1.00 for each gallon produced after December 31, 2025.

No Double Counting. To qualify for the credit, the transportation fuel must not be produced from a fuel for which the Section 45Z credit was allowable.

Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

Rate Parity. The base credit rate for carbon oxides captured from an industrial source and injected for enhanced oil or gas recovery or utilized is increased from $12 to $17 per metric ton so that it is equal to the base credit rate for permanent sequestration. Similarly, in the case of direct air capture facilities, the base credit rate for carbon oxides captured and injected for enhanced oil or gas recovery or utilized is increased from $26 to $36 per metric ton. Such increases apply to facilities or equipment placed in service after July 4, 2025.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

Wind Components. The Section 45X credit is terminated for wind components produced and sold after December 31, 2027.

Metallurgical Coal. Metallurgical coal that is suitable for the production of steel (regardless of whether production occurs inside or outside of the United States) was added as an applicable critical mineral. This change applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Phase-out. The phase-out of the Section 45X credit was modified so that the credit (other than with respect to metallurgical coal) is subject to a 25 percent, 50 percent and 75 percent reduction in 2031, 2032 and 2033, respectively. The Section 45X credit terminates for metallurgical coal after 2029 and for other applicable critical minerals after 2033.

Battery Modules. The definition of “battery module” was changed to require each module to be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.” This change applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Integrated Components. The OBBBA allows manufacturers to claim the Section 45X credit on multiple primary components that are integrated, incorporated or assembled into secondary components if (a) the primary components are produced in the same facility as the secondary components, (b) the secondary components are sold to unrelated persons and (c) at least 65 percent of the direct material costs to produce the secondary components are attributable to primary components that are mined, produced or manufactured in the United States. This change applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V)

Termination. The Section 45V credit is terminated for projects that begin construction after December 31, 2027.

Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) Rules

The OBBBA restricts taxpayers with connections to certain countries or foreign entities from claiming credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z and 48E. The FEOC rules largely relate to China, Russia, Iran and North Korea (as well as certain listed foreign persons and entities, which are not discussed below). In general, a taxpayer is prohibited from claiming credits under any one of the following circumstances:

The taxpayer is a “specified foreign entity.”

A specified foreign entity includes, among others, (a) the government of China, Russia, Iran or North Korea; (b) a citizen or national of one of those countries (provided that such person is not a U.S. citizen, national or resident); (c) an entity organized in, or having its principal place of business in, one of those countries; and (d) an entity owned more than 50 percent by persons described in clauses (a) through (c).

This restriction applies to the credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z and 48E for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

The taxpayer is a “foreign-influenced entity.”

A foreign-influenced entity includes an entity with respect to which (a) a specified foreign entity has authority to appoint board members or officers, (b) a single specified foreign entity owns at least 25 percent of such entity, (c) multiple specified foreign entities own at least 40 percent of such entity or (d) at least 15 percent of the debt of such entity is held by specified foreign entities.

This restriction applies to the credits under Sections 45Q, 45X, 45Y and 48E for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 and to the credits under Sections 45U and 45Z for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

The taxpayer receives “material assistance” on a project from specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities.

A project is deemed to receive material assistance if the material assistance cost ratio for the project is less than the applicable threshold percentage. The threshold percentages increase over time and range from 40 percent to 90 percent depending on the year, credit and technology. The material assistance cost ratio is computed as a fraction, with the numerator equaling total direct costs attributable to manufactured products and components not manufactured by specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities, and the denominator equaling total direct costs attributable to manufactured products and components.

The Secretary of the Treasury is required to issue safe harbor tables by December 31, 2026 identifying total direct cost percentages attributable to manufactured products and components. Until the safe harbor tables are issued, taxpayers may rely on the percentages in the domestic content safe harbor tables in IRS Notice 2025-08, certifications from suppliers regarding direct costs and certifications from suppliers stating that manufactured products and components were not manufactured or produced by a specified foreign entity or foreign-influenced entity.

For these purposes, a foreign-influenced entity also includes an entity that made payments to a specified foreign entity in the prior taxable year pursuant to a contract, agreement or arrangement that allows the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise “effective control” over a project or the production of any components (Specified Foreign Entity Payments).

This restriction applies to the credits under Section 45Y and 48E for projects that begin construction after December 31, 2025 (on a project-by-project basis) and to the Section 45X credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

In addition, if a taxpayer makes Specified Foreign Entity Payments within 10 years after a project claiming the Section 48E credit is placed in service, the full amount of the credit claimed is subject to recapture. This restriction applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

International Tax

Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) (Now “Net CFC Tested Income” (NCTI)) (Section 904)

Rate. The OBBBA modifies the global intangible low-taxed income inclusion rules such that a corporation’s effective GILTI rate will increase from 10.5 percent to 14 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. This change preempts the increase in the GILTI rate to 13.125 percent that was scheduled to take effect.

QBAI. Currently, a taxpayer can effectively exclude 10 percent of a controlled foreign corporation’s qualified business asset investment (QBAI) from the taxpayer’s GILTI inclusion calculation. The OBBBA eliminates this QBAI exclusion for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) (Now “Foreign-Derived Deduction Eligible Income” (FDDEI)) (Section 250)

Rate. Similar to those modifications made to the GILTI regime, the OBBBA modifies the FDII rules such that a corporation’s effective FDII rate will increase from 13.125 percent to 14 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. This change preempts the increase in the FDII rate to 16.4 percent that was scheduled to take effect.

The FEL was introduced at the end of December 2024. It aims to provide trustworthy and consistent information to consumers on sustainable travel. Air France-KLM is the first airline to announce its intention to voluntarily adopt the label, and hopes that as well as being “a means to enhance communication on [its] decarbonisation strategy to passengers” it will also have “the final goal of securing a competitive edge in the industry”.

When operational, the FEL will provide passengers with information allowing them to view and compare the estimated Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions of their flight (expressed in kilogrammes of carbon dioxide equivalent (kg CO2eq)) “enabling them to make more informed purchasing decisions”.

Under the Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) signed with EASA, Air France-KLM will test and then implement the digital FEL platform.

The FEL’s full remit is “to empower passengers with information on flight-related emissions, allowing them to make informed decisions when booking and comparing flights. The label will also increase accountability within the aviation sector by establishing a harmonised emissions calculation methodology, data reporting, and emissions display for all airlines in the European Union”

The FEL was set up because of the perceived lack of a common methodology and criteria for estimating flight emissions. The Commission said that this “leads airlines and ticket sellers to report emission levels using disparate methodologies which are not necessarily comparable. The Flight Emissions Label aims to change this by setting out a reliable and harmonised methodology for estimating flight emissions, considering factors like aircraft type, average passenger numbers and freight volume on board, as well as aviation fuel used”.

When searching for flights or booking tickets online, a dedicated logo will be displayed alongside the flight emissions data. “This will help passengers make informed decisions and protect them from misleading greenwashing claims,” says the Commission. “The Flight Emissions Label will support aviation’s transition to net zero by ensuring fair competition among airlines, promoting the uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), and supporting fleet renewal. Since the estimations are based on actual consumption data, it will also encourage airlines to operate more efficiently and sustainably.”

Apostolos Tzitzikostas, Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, stated: “I warmly welcome the decision by Air France and KLM to become the first airlines to join the EU Flight Emissions Label. This decisive step turns their commitment to decarbonisation into concrete action, reinforcing fair competition, transparency, and trust. It also marks a key milestone in the rollout of the EU Flight Emissions Label and ReFuelEU Aviation, while helping to accelerate the uptake of sustainable aviation fuels to cut flight emissions. I encourage other airlines to join this initiative, driving a more sustainable and transparent future for European aviation.”

Airlines from both EU and non-EU countries, covered under the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 “ReFuelEU Aviation”, can voluntarily join the FEL. Only those airlines that have joined are allowed to display emissions to their passengers in the European Union, in accordance with Article 6(5) of the Regulation. The European Commission and EASA are encouraging airlines to join the FEL if they want to display flight emissions and use these estimates when, for example, offering sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or other emissions offsets to passengers.",https://cdn.businesstraveller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/FEL-Background-image-phone-screen-verified-logo-v2-1-e1752661563205.png,N,,2025-07-16 14:17:37.521887

If just 10% of that market could be made into SAF from corn ethanol, that would generate an additional 6.5 billion bushels of new corn demand.
The decision to block the bill, “will ensure ethanol plants remain here in Iowa, and that Iowa remains the most competitively advantaged to produce ethanol,” Sauer says.
“This will set Iowa ethanol plants up for potential expansions.” Every state understands the repercussions of stalling CO2 pipeline development, including Sauer and his team at ICGA.
POET, the world’s largest producer of biofuels, commended Reynolds’ veto.","Iowa corn growers and ethanol producers now have a fighting chance to capture future market share thanks to the veto power of Gov. Kim Reynolds. In early June, Reynolds chose to veto HF 639, a bill that many believed would have prevented carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects from happening in Iowa.

Several prominent voices affiliated with Iowa’s farming economy spoke out in favor of Reynolds’ decision. That support was accompanied by a respectful acknowledgement of the complexity of CCS projects, specifically pipelines, and their impact on property rights and eminent domain.

While South Dakota’s openness to carbon pipeline projects remains in flux, Iowa now joins Nebraska, Minnesota, Illinois and North Dakota as states with a foundation in place for the operation of current or future carbon pipeline routes. On December 12, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approved the state’s first carbon pipeline route. On the same day, North Dakota’s Public Utilities Commission took essentially the same action. Nebraska has approved multiple pipeline routes to move CO2, as has Illinois.

Veto Decision Brings Clarity

Although there was no specific language in HF 639 that outright banned CCS projects in Iowa, provisions in the bill would have prevented such activity through the use of new restrictions on eminent domain for CO2 projects and new restrictions on permitting.

Reynolds provided a lengthy explanation regarding her decision to veto: “Reasonable people can—and do—disagree about when the government, or a private company acting with government approval, should be allowed to take private land,” she wrote. “That debate is as old as the Republic. At its core, it asks how we protect individual property rights while still building the infrastructure—roads, utilities, pipelines—that modern life depends on.

“I respect both sides of that debate. I’ve consistently said that if eminent domain is used, it must be rare, fair, and a last resort. But HF 639 isn’t just about eminent domain,” she continued. “It goes much further—and in doing so, sets a troubling precedent that threatens Iowa’s energy reliability, economy and reputation as a place where businesses can invest with confidence.”

The day after Reynolds’ veto, Iowa House Speaker Pat Grassley called for a special session to consider overriding her decision; the idea received support from over two-thirds of the House. Senate leaders, however, said a special session—also needing sign-off from two-thirds of the lawmakers in that chamber—was unlikely. At press time in late June, a special session did not appear to have momentum.

Speaking to Ethanol Producer Magazine after the veto in early June, Ryan Sauer, vice president of market development for the Iowa Corn Growers Association, said, “In the end, property rights are important, but so is finding new demand outlets as farmers continue to produce more corn.”

Sauer says ICGA’s members are seeing significant challenges in the farm economy right now, specifically farm profitability due to high input costs and low commodity prices. The ability of Iowa farmers to grow corn for lower-carbon ethanol production over the next decade will, in part, be made possible through CCS. It’s key to the industry’s future.

“This will help unlock low-carbon fuel markets around the world such as sustainable aviation fuel,” he says, explaining that the global jet fuel market is projected to grow to about 120 billion gallons over the next decade. If just 10% of that market could be made into SAF from corn ethanol, that would generate an additional 6.5 billion bushels of new corn demand.

Crop projections from the USDA highlight the significance of Sauer’s point. As of early June, the USDA had projected that 1.8 billion bushels of corn will have unmet demand from the 2025 planted crop. That unmet demand could grow as high as 2.5 billion bushels over the next several years.

“These new markets are key to ensuring farmers have new demand for their corn as yields continue to increase and countries like South America continue to grow more corn,” he says.

Reynolds included a specific example of a CO2 pipeline in the works (by Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy) as a reason why the bill needed to be blocked. Reynolds said the bill’s call for new insurance mandates and an arbitrary 25-year limit on CO2 pipelines would have killed projects like the one SIRE is developing.

Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy, said Reynolds’ decision will allow farmers and producers alike to accelerate investment in U.S. energy innovation. Skor also said her team looked forward to working with elected officials to find a balanced policy solution.

For Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw, part of the issue with the legislation was its inaccuracies. “Any thoughtful review of this bill would determine that it would lead to higher energy prices for Iowans, hamper future economic development, hold back job creation and stifle new markets,” he said. Shaw believes that Reynolds studied and deliberated over the legislation, ultimately looking beyond anti-pipeline rhetoric that was “as inaccurate as it was loud.”

The bill’s impact would not have been limited to CO2 pipeline projects. Some of its provisions applied to all hazardous liquid pipelines. Those provisions would change permitting rules across the board and inject uncertainty into critical energy projects, including those focused on oil, gas and fertilizer, Reynolds wrote.

The premise that safety concerns provided justification for stopping CO2 pipelines in Iowa was also dismissed by Reynolds in her decision rationale. She cited robust regulations already in place by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA).

Pending updates to CO2 pipeline safety requirements under review by PHMSA could also enhance protocols currently in place. Since December 2023, PHSMA has seen a 10-fold increase in CCS projects under development nationwide. A report provided to PHMSA by the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, by 2050, the mileage of CO2 pipelines in the U.S. could expand by as much as 10 times the current number of more than 5,000 miles in operation. This projected growth, in part, is prompting PHMSA to consider enhanced federal pipeline safety requirements.

In addition to addressing safety concerns, Reynolds also spoke to the economic reality of CO2 pipelines in relation to other states. She pointed out that other states have already created a framework that will enable such development and Iowa will not be left out.

“Iowa leads the nation in biofuels,” she said in her decision. “We are at the forefront of turning corn into low-carbon energy—a leadership position we risk losing if we block the infrastructure that makes it possible. Other Midwestern states, like Nebraska, Illinois and North Dakota are already moving forward with carbon capture projects that would put Iowa at a competitive disadvantage if this bill became law.”

Sauer echoed Reynolds’ rationale related to the economic possibilities for Iowa. The decision to block the bill, “will ensure ethanol plants remain here in Iowa, and that Iowa remains the most competitively advantaged to produce ethanol,” Sauer says. “This will set Iowa ethanol plants up for potential expansions.”

Every state understands the repercussions of stalling CO2 pipeline development, including Sauer and his team at ICGA. Keeping the door open for CCS to happen in Iowa will ensure it doesn’t become disadvantaged to places like Nebraska that have already begun pursuing a carbon pipeline as the markets build out for low-carbon fuels.

POET, the world’s largest producer of biofuels, commended Reynolds’ veto. “At a time when commodity prices are low, these CO2 investments will expand market access for Iowa corn, biofuels and bioproducts across the globe, increasing the value of every bushel of corn and every acre of Iowa cropland,” said Jeff Broin, POET founder and CEO. “This decision will bring benefits to Iowa farmers for generations to come.”

POET has already started working to develop a CO2 capture plan with Tallgrass, an infrastructure company with pipeline operations in multiple states for several products including oil, natural gas and CO2. POET’s Fairmont bioprocessing facility in southern Nebraska will capture CO2 and transport it via the Tallgrass Trailblazer line to a permanent underground sequestration site in Wyoming. Tallgrass is converting an existing natural gas pipeline that has operated for more than a decade.

Under the Trailblazer Community Benefits Agreement, POET’s commitment will also support additional direct funding to the landowners who have agreed to site the pipeline on their property and the communities that are hosting the infrastructure.

South Dakota’s Role

Although Iowa’s current stance on CCS infrastructure and CO2 pipeline development is (post veto) ostensibly affirmative, the full realization of a project like Summit Carbon Solutions may not be quite as clear as some may have hoped.

Minnesota’s PUC has said that before any work begins on the portion of the pipeline that runs through the state, work must have already started in neighboring North Dakota, the storage destination for the CO2 that would be moved by Summit. North Dakota has had its share of regulatory wrinkles with CO2, but like Nebraska and Illinois, it does now appear primed for pipeline work to begin.

And then there is South Dakota. Like Reynolds, South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden also made a momentous decision on CO2 pipeline development. Rhoden’s determination, however, was nearly the opposite of Reynolds’. “I am no stranger to discussions about eminent domain and property rights,” Rhoden wrote, explaining his long history fighting for private property rights as a legislator and landowner.

Rhoden signed HB 1052, a bill that bans eminent domain for carbon pipelines. Although the decision may be viewed as a setback to those in favor of using the tool to help develop the South Dakota portion of Summit’s multi-state project, Rhoden offered another perspective.

“I also want to ensure that we keep South Dakota ‘Open for Opportunity,’” he wrote. “HB 1052 does not kill the proposed project. Rather than viewing this legislation as an obstacle, I encourage Summit and others to view it as an opportunity for a needed reset. Voluntary easements for this proposed project will still be able to move forward and are not impacted by HB 1052.

“The ethanol industry will remain a crucial part of our state’s economy,” Rhoden said. As South Dakota’s place in any in-state or multi-state CO2 project continues to play out, Sauer and his team believe the stakes and situation are clear in Iowa.

“We are working hard on E15 expansion, but we need more,” Sauer says. The ability for CCS projects to happen in Iowa “will ultimately position corn farmers to take advantage of any low-carbon fuel market and ensure future generations of farmers can enjoy the same success and prosperity we have seen for the past two decades.”

“On a personal basis, I can see that there is a strong argument now for the inclusion of video,” Director General Willie Walsh said in Singapore on Wednesday. “Based on what little we know now, it’s quite possible that a video recording, in addition to the voice recording, would significantly assist the investigators.”

The idea of cockpit cameras has been fiercely debated for decades, but has been thrust into the spotlight once again in the wake of last month’s Air India crash in Ahmedabad. A preliminary report into the accident that killed 260 people on board the Boeing Co. 787 aircraft and on the ground revealed that the fuel-supply switches were switched off — dooming the jet almost immediately after takeoff.

Authorities have so far only released a short transcript that shows one pilot asking his colleague why he turned off the fuel supply, to which the second pilot answered he had not.

It isn’t clear if this was the extent of the cockpit conversation, and authorities didn’t identify which pilot said what, leaving the key question of how the switches were moved to a cut-off position unanswered. Still, Walsh said the initial report was more comprehensive than expected.

Walsh, in Singapore for events including a summit on aviation safety, reiterated his optimistic outlook for the industry, which has weathered disruptions from conflicts to escalating geopolitical tensions. While some carriers have scaled back their Asian operations, only travel between the US and Canada has been significantly impacted by the Trump administration’s tariffs, according to Walsh.

IATA projects 5.8% growth in air travel demand this year. Over the longer-term, Walsh cautioned that travelers will have to pay higher fares due to the rising cost of meeting climate goals.

The cost of complying with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation will hit $1 billion this year and balloon to about $15 billion over the next decade, Walsh said.

He pointed to Singapore’s plan to add a levy to ticket prices next year to purchase cleaner fuel as a good model for stimulating demand for sustainable aviation fuel. Other regions, like Europe, may struggle to meet their SAF goals as production remains scarce, Walsh said.

Singapore’s Changi Airport, which typically ranks as one of the world’s most popular and recently broke ground on a vast new terminal, is also an industry leader in sectors like automation, according to Walsh.

“Compared to what I see in Europe, it’s like night and day,” said Walsh, who was previously the chief executive officer of British Airways. “Aviation is truly valued in this region.”

Growing demand for renewable fuel is reshaping crop decisions across the Southern United States, where farmers are rapidly expanding winter canola production. Traditionally grown in the U.S. Northern Plains, canola is now gaining traction in Southern double-crop rotations—driven largely by a strategic partnership between Bunge, Chevron and Corteva Agriscience.

Interest in winter canola production has been focused on the potential for winter oilseeds to contribute to the U.S Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Grand Challenge goal of 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050.

The partnership combines Bunge’s grain origination and processing, Chevron’s fuel distribution, and Corteva’s proprietary genetics to position winter canola as a leading feedstock for renewable fuel. Central to this strategy is a new oilseed processing facility in Destrehan, Louisiana, which is slated to begin processing canola by 2026.

To meet projected demand by 2026, the strategic partnership launched a pilot program in the 2023–24 marketing year, contracting 5,000 acres across western Kentucky and Tennessee. By 2024–25, the initiative expanded to over 35,000 acres spanning Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, and Missouri (Pioneer, 2024). Reported insured acres from USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA) confirm this growth (Figure 1), with average increases of nearly 500% across Alabama, Kentucky, and Tennessee—highlighted by 7,500 acres in Tennessee and 25,000 in Kentucky.

Based on the anticipated crush capacity at the Destrehan, LA facility, near-term canola demand could reach 100,000 to 150,000 acres across the Southern United States. Over the longer term, the partnering companies project demand could rise to nearly 1 million acres as infrastructure and markets scale (Heslip, 2024).

Early reports from Kentucky and Tennessee suggest winter canola average yields of 40–65 bushels per acre. Contract prices for 2024 (2025 crop year) hovered around $12 per bushel, depending on contract timing, acres contracted, and freight costs. Gross revenue of $480-$780 per acre provides many mid-south farmers with a viable financial alternative to traditional soft red winter wheat production (Gross revenue of $420-$468; University of Kentucky and University of Tennessee 2025 Crop Budgets).

Many growers report lower input costs compared to winter wheat, contributing to higher profit margins at current price levels. Currently, acreage contracts are being offered to producers for fall planting. Acreage contracts provide producers with a defined number of acres at a specified price. Production is not specified in the contract; the contract writer takes all production for the contracted acres at the set price. Before entering a production contract, producers need to fully understand the terms and conditions, including production practices, delivery, and quality specifications.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt27de21f7bb17ee4b/687793adb16d914694ff9161/canola-GettyImages-157331241-alexxx1981.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-16 09:09:39.269702

""I've been critical of the EU targets because I don't think they're going to be achieved,"" International Air Transport Association director-general Willie Walsh told reporters in Singapore.

""I struggle to see how we will have sufficient sustainable aviation fuel available to meet the near-term target.""

EU rules require carriers to include two percent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six percent in 2030 before soaring to 70 percent from 2050.

But a study published by Airlines for Europe, an industry group representing 17 carriers, estimated that SAF production would be 30 percent below levels necessary to achieve the goal in 2030.

""I think the EU in particular needs to reevaluate the targets that they've set,"" Walsh said, adding however that the industry target of net-zero emissions by 2050 was still achievable.

He said IATA had been reluctant to the idea of setting some near-term targets.

What the EU should have been doing was to assess the current and future production of green fuel ""and then set a target relevant to the production"", according to Walsh.

""The idea that we're setting targets when we're not seeing the production of sustainable fuel makes no sense whatsoever,"" he said.

Walsh said individual airlines in Europe ""are buying SAF outside of the EU to comply with their targets"", which he said also ""doesn't make an awful lot of sense"" because of the carbon footprint generated by transporting the fuel.

Contributing to almost three percent of carbon dioxide emissions globally, the aviation sector is among the toughest to decarbonise.

SAF -- a biofuel that produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel, made from plant and animal materials like cooking oil and fat -- is seen as a crucial ingredient to hitting emissions targets.

Under enterprising projects to tackle climate change, the European Union demands that airlines gradually raise the quantity of so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) they utilise to fuel planes. Airlines, however, grumble that the method is not widely available and too costly.

Why is IATA critical of EU green targets?

“I’ve been critical of the EU targets because I don’t think they’re going to be achieved,”

International Air Transport Association director-general Willie Walsh briefed journalists in Singapore.

“I struggle to see how we will have sufficient sustainable aviation fuel available to meet the near-term target.”

How much SAF is required under EU rules?

According to impending EU legislation, carriers will need to include either in their fuel mix 2% of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) beginning this year, 6% by 2030 and then increase to 70% beginning in 2050.

However, an analysis published by Airlines for Europe, which represents 17 carriers, estimated that among major producing regions, SAF production will be noted as 30% less taken together than what the aim suggests by 2030.

“I think the EU in particular needs to reevaluate the targets that they’ve set,”

Walsh stated, adding, however, that the industry goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 was still possible. He stated IATA had been hesitant to the concept of putting some near-term goals.

Is the EU setting targets without fuel supply data?

What the European Union should have been accomplishing was to evaluate the current and coming production of green fuel,

“and then set a target relevant to the production”,

He said.

“The idea that we’re setting targets when we’re not seeing the production of sustainable fuel makes no sense whatsoever,”

“doesn’t make an awful lot of sense”

Due to the carbon footprint caused by transporting the fuel.

What makes SAF essential to aviation decarbonization goals?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a biofuel made from renewable plant and animal materials such as used cooking oil, fats, and other biomass feedstocks. SAF is meant to substantially reduce carbon emissions compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. SAF is vital for the aviation industry’s ability to meet target emissions, such as net-zero emissions by 2050. SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by 80% and, in certain cases, 94% depending on the provided feedstock and type of process.",https://brusselsmorning.com/wp-content/uploads/IATA-chief-urges-EU-to-revise-airline-green-fuel-targets.webp,N,,2025-07-16 11:07:34.707397

Dear reader,

The farmers are back. As the European Commission gears up to announce later today its plans for the EU budget post-2027 — including how much of the pie agriculture should receive — farmers have returned to the streets of Brussels, apparently planning this time to leave a pile of boots outside the EU executive’s headquarters.

Farmers are not the only ones fearful of cuts to their spending. Ahead of the announcement of the multiannual financial framework, nature campaigners have warned about the dangers of slashing support for biodiversity, and climate groups fear defence will win out over decarbonisation.

“In the negotiations on the next MFF, decision makers must keep the EU’s long-term investment needs front and centre,” says Clara Calipel, research fellow at the Institute for Climate Economics think-tank. “This includes the climate transition, which is hampered by an investment gap of over €300bn annually.”

Calipel urges policymakers to ensure the budget becomes “a cornerstone in a long-term investment framework for the EU, offering stability in turbulent times, providing predictability to private economic actors, and helping reduce the climate investment gap in a timely and cost-effective manner”.

I’ll be following developments in Brussels today and will update you in tomorrow morning’s newsletter.

Legal risks of calling alternative aviation fuels ‘sustainable’

Elsewhere, UK non-profit Opportunity Green argues airlines, financial institutions and other associated businesses should stop using the term “sustainable aviation fuel” to describe fuels being touted as greener alternatives to fossil kerosene to power aircraft. It says the term is misleading and could leave organisations open to legal risks.

Instead, companies should label them as “alternative fuels” and include information on their full lifecycle environmental impacts, the report argues.

While the future of the EU Green Claims Directive is decidedly shaky, the non-profit says the bloc’s Unfair Commercial Practices Directive already prevents companies from providing false or incomplete information about a product to consumers and includes articles on green claims. And the EU directive on “empowering consumers for the green transition” prohibits “sustainable” from being used as a generic claim to demonstrate environmental performance without the inclusion of a product’s social performance, it notes.

Over in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority has the power to fine companies misleading consumers, including through greenwashing, under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act, which came into force in April.

Retailers face real repercussions under DMCC

Indeed, writing just over a year after the DMCC was introduced, Duncan Reed and Roni Rossa from law firm TLT urge all retailers to ensure their houses are in order. The act carries real financial and reputational repercussions for those that fail to comply, they warn.

“While the CMA has allowed businesses a grace period of three months to comply with the rules on fake reviews, we may well see the CMA’s first multimillion-pound fine for greenwashing in the UK in the near future,” write Reed and Rossa.

“Retailers need to act now to review their advertising claims — past, present and future — and implement internal processes and systems to ensure they are not misleading the average consumer.”

Gas for tech giants

Meanwhile, Troutman Pepper Locke partner Jennie Simmons says US federal policies are driving fresh interest in oil and gas, but underlines that private equity companies are also continuing to explore opportunities in low-carbon areas such as nuclear, solar and energy storage.

One reason for this attention from investors in all energy sources is the US’s exploding electricity demand driven by artificial intelligence-heavy data centres. Where once tech companies were boasting about their green credentials, they may increasingly look to broaden their horizons to include gas.

Simmons quotes Tailwater Capital co-founder and managing director Jason Downie, who says: “If you had asked me five years ago whether these tech giants would be advocating for natural gas, I’d have said no way. But they understand that energy reliability is non-negotiable.”

Until tomorrow,

“The idea that you’re buying sustainable fuel and then transporting it to use in Europe isn’t the right way to do it, because you’re clearly increasing the carbon footprint of that fuel as a result of the transportation costs,” Iata’s director-general Willie Walsh said at a media roundtable in Singapore.

Iata estimated in June that production of SAF, which is considered

a low-carbon replacement for traditional jet fuel,

is expected to reach two million tonnes, or 0.7 per cent of airlines’ fuel consumption, in 2025.

“Mandating the use of a product that isn’t available doesn’t lead to any environmental benefit,” Mr Walsh said, adding that fuel companies that have an obligation to produce SAF are also increasing the cost of traditional jet fuel.

By Iata’s assessment, he said “the cost that they’re charging is way in excess of the actual cost of the limited supplies of sustainable fuel”.

“The EU in effect has facilitated monopoly suppliers to increase prices with no environmental benefit,” said Mr Walsh, adding that the region needs to re-evaluate its SAF targets.

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation requirement, airlines need to have a 6 per cent SAF blend in their jet fuel usage by 2030. The EU is offering some subsidies for SAF purchases by airlines, Reuters reported in June.

On the supply front, at least five SAF projects in Asia, outside of China, have started up or are earmarked to start production in 2025 , targeting exports regionally and to Europe. Singapore is among key exporters of the green fuel to the EU.

Mr Walsh also questioned the use of palm oil as a means to produce sustainable fuel.

“I think that you could argue there is sustainable palm oil and there is palm oil that wouldn’t be considered sustainable, and I think in some parts of the world there it’s too black and white,” Mr Walsh said.

We need to have a much more “nuanced approach” to the usage of palm oil as a feedstock and “much more detailed assessment of the sustainability of the feedstock”, he added.

According to PepsiCo, the creation of a more resilient agricultural system is critical to its business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries for its food and beverages. The company recently announced a new goal to drive the adoption of regenerative agriculture, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres of land used to grow crops and ingredients for its products by 2030.

Iowa contributed more than 15% of the US’ supply of corn last year. As such, efforts will be led on the ground by nonprofit organization Practical Farmers of Iowa, which will provide tailored agronomic advice, technical guidance and incentive payments to help farmers transition to regenerative practices, as well as enrollment and verification services.

Participating farmers will receive support to adopt techniques such as cover cropping, reduced tillage, and nutrient management.

Jim Andrew, PepsiCo’s Chief Sustainability Officer, said:

“By working with farmers to understand what’s best for their farms and partnering across the supply chain we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers. This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.”

Cargill has said that this collaboration will support its commitment to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland and provide training on sustainable agriculture practices and improve access to markets for 10 million farmers by 2030.

Under ambitious plans to tackle climate change, the EU requires airlines to gradually increase the amount of so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) they use to power planes.

Airlines, however, complain that SAF is not widely available and too expensive.

""I've been critical of the EU targets because I don't think they're going to be achieved,"" International Air Transport Association director-general Willie Walsh told reporters in Singapore.

""I struggle to see how we will have sufficient sustainable aviation fuel available to meet the near-term target.""

EU rules require carriers to include two percent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six percent in 2030 before soaring to 70 percent from 2050.

But a study published by Airlines for Europe, an industry group representing 17 carriers, estimated that SAF production would be 30 percent below levels necessary to achieve the goal in 2030.

""I think the EU in particular needs to reevaluate the targets that they've set,"" Walsh said, adding however that the industry target of net-zero emissions by 2050 was still achievable.

He said IATA had been reluctant to the idea of setting some near-term targets.

What the EU should have been doing was to assess the current and future production of green fuel ""and then set a target relevant to the production"", according to Walsh.

""The idea that we're setting targets when we're not seeing the production of sustainable fuel makes no sense whatsoever,"" he said.

Walsh said individual airlines in Europe ""are buying SAF outside of the EU to comply with their targets"", which he said also ""doesn't make an awful lot of sense"" because of the carbon footprint generated by transporting the fuel.

Q Thank you for joining us. I think we are in a slightly unusual position, in that we are all competing to try to make slight improvements to legislation that we all agree is necessary and positive. My question is about the source of the funding for the RCM. The Government made it clear that their preference is that it comes from a levy on users. An alternative, which we see in other jurisdictions, is that it comes from ETS sources, which would slightly more directly couple the emissions component to the consumption. The intention to not predicate the source of funding on the money being provided is clear. Do any of the panellists have an opinion on those two options and the path that the Government have taken for the funding source?

Gaynor Hartnell: There are really only two options for the levy: airlines or aviation fuel suppliers. A large part of why aviation fuel suppliers were chosen may have been because, administratively, they are the obligated party when it comes to the mandate. They are expected to pass the cost of the mandate through to airlines—their fuel customers. They would be expected to pass the cost of the levy to airlines, or indeed, if the levy actually brings in money—these are very small balances of money in comparison with the balances to do with the mandate—they would be expected to pass those costs back to the customers. The aim is to deal fairly with a fairly small amount of money. It is not the additional cost of the sustainable aviation fuel; it is just the cost of levelising and stabilising it, which is a sliver in comparison.

Rob Griggs: For us as airlines, the funding is a critical issue about fairness and accountability. As Gaynor said, the understanding is that the levy will be on the supplier. The issue for us is that we understand that the costs are likely to be passed through to airlines. We just want to make sure that that is transparent. We have seen through the early stages of the mandate that there is some concern that excessive compliance fees are perhaps being put on to the SAF. Voluntary SAF seems to be a lot cheaper than mandated SAF and there is not necessarily a clear reason for that. We want transparency in terms of how the levy is passed through.

As Gaynor said, in theory, if the market price for SAF is high—if there is relatively little of it—it is likely that the suppliers will actually pay into the counterparty. We want to make sure that if money is essentially being paid back to the counterparty from the producers, that money does not just go to the suppliers and sit there. There should be a transparent mechanism, however it works, through which that money then comes back to airlines and airline customers. It has to work both ways, essentially.

How do you do that? We have looked at ETS for a long time. You are right that in the European Union, the emissions trading scheme funds are used: for example, to help to close the price gap on SAF. We are not doing that, which has competitiveness implications for UK SAF, separate to the RCM. Of course there are ways to make sure that it is a two-way street.

Paul Greenwood: We have to recognise that if the desire is to pass the cost on to the passengers, the airlines and the people who are shipping freight around the world by plane, then we should put the charge on them. That is the most direct way of doing it. There are charges now that are put on airlines and on freight directly. There is no reason why you cannot do this as well. I do not buy the argument that it is a relatively small amount of money, therefore we should just put it on to the fuel suppliers and they should deal with it. I do not think that is right. I certainly do not agree with the idea that this is because “the polluter pays”—that is erroneous and a false statement.

We do not know how much this will be, because we do not know how many projects there will be, what the costs will be, or how the CFD mechanism will go. We do not know what the cost of this will be. I support what Rob is saying: if this is something imposed upon us, I do not wish to profit from it but I do want to pass 100% of it on to the consumer of my fuel. The only way I can do that is if I know what it is ahead of time, so that I can bill them the exact amount of money so they pay the exact amount. At the moment, this legislation talks about market share, but market share moves and changes. Therefore it is a very imprecise way of doing that.

Ours is a very fine margin business. If you get this wrong, you will make the UK a less attractive market. We have to understand that fundamentally people will do different things around their molecules. One data point worth remembering is that about 70% of the jet fuel consumed in the UK at the moment is imported. Effectively, we rely on people bringing jet to market to sell it profitably. If they are uncertain around the cost of that jet fuel, they will potentially look to sell it into different markets, which can lead to energy security and market dynamic issues. There are unintended consequences here that need to be thought through very carefully.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - -

Q Thank you all for joining us. The evidence that you have given so far has been very helpful. There was a question earlier about waste hierarchy and the availability of waste feedstocks as one source of raw fuel or raw material for some of the second-generation SAF. Is enough being done across Government, in a holistic way, to ensure that the goals of the SAF mandate, the RCM and this Bill are achieved? Is enough being done to ensure that the things that are needed—waste feedstocks, the reforms to planning and energy production for eSAFs—are in place? What is going to hold back what we are trying to achieve in this Bill, and what needs to be done elsewhere?

Jonathon Counsell: That is a really strong point. There is a key question about the waste hierarchy, which Gaynor spoke to. Currently, waste going to SAF is treated the same way as incineration or energy from waste, but the analysis is clear that we can get twice as much energy capture from producing SAF than from producing energy from waste. We feel that you are getting a lot more bang for your buck from using waste to produce SAF than from other things, which we think should be reflected in aviation being prioritised in the waste hierarchy.

On renewable energy, last year the Sustainable Aviation road map made it quite clear that 3G SAF—where you basically electrolyse water to get hydrogen and you capture CO2 from the atmosphere—is going to take a lot of renewable electricity. We are going to need a lot more of that within the UK if we are going to support a domestic power-to-liquid market.

Luke Ervine: In addition to that, we need to think about other areas of SAF, when we talk about SAF having a nominal value associated with its ability to reduce greenhouse gases. We are working alongside the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and the Department for Business and Trade to understand how carbon can form part of the solution, and decarbonising the SAF that we are producing is also key. We are also working side by side with the Treasury to understand what the revenues from the ETS look like.

That has been quite successful in the last few years, especially since the advent of the jet zero taskforce, which was a really key turning point. I think we are going to continue in that vein to work cross-departmentally and across industry to work through some of these finer details. I think it has been very useful to be part of the Jet Zero Council; we are actually a co-chair, alongside Mike Kane, of the jet zero taskforce. Carrying on in that vein is very important and useful.

Lahiru Ranasinghe: This also enables us to reduce our dependence on used cooking oil imported from elsewhere in the world as a feedstock for first generation SAF. A strategic move towards 2G and 3G also gives more flexibility and capability for the market to scale up in the long-term, and allows it to use waste products from the UK, as opposed to having to ship it in from China or south-east Asia.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - -

I just have a pushback or challenge on the comments about SAF being popular. An earlier pushback, too, was on the £1.50 per passenger on top of tickets. Does that suggest that this might be easier to sell—easier to promote—to passengers than you might have suggested in the first place? I think the suggestion was that certain demographics and certain airline customer groups will be more or less in favour and able to pay it.

Lahiru Ranasinghe: To add to that, for us, the average leisure traveller would say—to put it in colloquial terms—“It’s your problem to solve. We want you to do it, but we’re not going to pay for it.” With corporates, they have their own corporate targets, so from a B2B—business to business—perspective, they want to hit those.

Jonathon Counsell: I will answer the risk question. Yes, without the policy, we have no 2G SAF, so we would be dependent on the 1G market, which will cap out in the early 2030s. We are not going to achieve our decarbonisation targets without 2G SAF. That is the biggest risk without the Bill.

The biggest risk with the Bill is buy-out. If the incentive does not produce enough SAF—we understand the buy-out is there to manage short-term supply shortages, but if we have long-term buy-out, which we have seen in the ground transport fuels market—that is policy failure. Essentially, that huge cost is £6,000 per tonne of SAF, and if that cost comes straight back to the airline, it will go on air fares, but you do not get any decarbonisation—you get huge cost and no decarbonisation. That is our biggest risk.

Luke Ervine: Some of the risks of the RCM that we need to be cognisant of include covering too much of the mandate with the RCM. We do not want to lock ourselves into high prices forever and a day. Obviously we want that to stimulate the part of the market that needs that support, so we want to leave enough room for competition.

The other thing we need to think about is how suppliers might bear some of the risk that is presented in the RCM—how some of the cost of capitalising the fund, or any cost of compliance failures that they may face, might be passed through to airlines and consumers. That key area of transparency is therefore important. This needs to be well thought through, but we also need to do it quickly because we are reaching a pivotal point in terms of buy-out where we will have to just pay for no decarb.

Lahiru Ranasinghe: Ultimately, the RCM is a derisking measure. It is a stepping stone towards what we want, which is a functioning SAF market. It is a complicated challenge. There is a lot of work to be done over the coming stages and throughout the process to make sure that we end up with a competitive UK SAF market so that producers can compete on a global scale, and, crucially, we as airlines can compete on a global and European scale by keeping flying affordable and continuing to grow in the UK. On an environmental level, if there is x amount of growth coming through the UK, which is supporting an environmentally robust SAF mandate, and production in the UK, as opposed to that going elsewhere in the world, that is driving sustainable growth on a global scale.

Jonathon Counsell: On the amendment question, I do not think we need to look at any amendments at this stage. On the targeting of the scheme, we should make it an opt-in scheme for the projects that need it. We do not want a blanket scheme to cover all 2G SAF because that is not needed, but we could have projects opt in with some qualifying criteria—for example, projects that are early stage, first of a kind or high risk, and that cannot get funding without the scheme.

I would not say SAF is popular—that is probably going a step too far. It is fair to say there is greater acceptance of SAF as a solution, but let us be clear: nobody wants to pay for it. However, we accept that there is a cost to the net zero transition, and our job is to minimise that cost as far as possible.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - -

Q Thank you both. A lot of the criticism and cynicism over the value of SAF and its environmental benefits are around the fuel source or feedstuff—you have alluded to it. The Bill concentrates on second and third generation SAF. Do you see that as enabling a lot of the potential greenwashing of SAF that may have been behind all that cynicism? Does it address some of those challenges?

As a follow-up question, similar to one that I asked the previous panel, what do you see as some of the challenges across Government that will hold back your ability to produce more SAF? You referred to the ability to use some of the feedstuff to produce second generation SAF mixing, but I think planning and energy will be among the responses as well.

Sophia Haywood: On sustainability and fraud, I have been working on sustainability certification over a number of different fuel types. We have ISCC, which is like an auditing process that we generally have to go through—there are other providers out there—to be able to prove the sustainability of our fuel. This is a very complicated and rigorous process, and I have gone through it many times on different types of fuels.

On the sustainability piece, the guidance that has been put out already in the SAF mandate is very high, and we have to go through a lot of that auditing process. To your point about the risk of fraud and other challenges around greenwashing that potentially could have happened in the past, I think the UK has done a good thing there with how it has approached this, so I support the approach that we are taking. That is not necessarily in this Bill; I would say that that has more already been laid out in the mandate rules.

On what else we would like to see, potentially, through this, as I said before, there is a piece around the SAF allowances—this is a scheme currently in Europe that is funded through ETS revenues. Obviously, you are always taking from somewhere with funding, but you are trying to take at least from a funding source that is coming directly from industry, and using that to then fund the industry back with SAF. I think that has good bones and good structure, and I would love to see that being fleshed out.

On a more practical level, for sure, there is planning. We have just had a recent example that some of my engineers have told me about: waiting two months for an answer on a very small question. It is not because of the quality of the planning teams; they are fantastic. It is the fact that they are quite constrained and there are not enough of them. I suppose there is a potential short-to-medium-term fix there, but also a longer-term fix in terms of thinking of the skills that we need moving forward. We automatically think of more engineering and STEM roles, but we also need the rest of the value chain to be adequate in terms of workforce and other things.

I alluded earlier to the details of the mandate being really good on the sustainability piece, but there are some very complex rules that we are still consistently trying to navigate six months on. There are different interpretations to different questions—for example, in the nitty gritty of how hydrogen is treated or the rules around electricity and displacement. They are more in the detail, but we end up spending quite a lot of time on them as a company trying to break through into this market.

Equally, it is a learning experience for my colleagues doing these projects all across the world. We have other projects going on in India and Australia. As a Brit, I want the UK to be our flagship and our first, and I am working hard to make sure that it is, but as I always say to people, I am competing with my colleagues in Australia and all over because lots of people want SAF. It is about how we can make it as efficient and easy as possible, keeping in mind all the good sustainability criteria, to get steel in the ground here in the UK.

Noaman Al Adhami: From our perspective, the route we are using—the Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene route—is an American Society for Testing and Materials route that is approved already. On sustainability, the feedstock criteria are well defined in the SAF mandate. All the types of feedstock that are eligible to produce SAF are well defined. We are complying with that. The greenhouse gas and carbon intensity are other factors for measuring sustainability. For our project, without carbon capture, we are at minus 80% or minus 85% from the fossil equivalent. With carbon capture, we will go negative—we will go to even more than minus 200%. That is key for us.

On what could be done better, planning is always an area where we need improvement in terms of time. There is also connection to the grid, for example—grid connections take a very long time. We decided to produce our own power on site using a biomass boiler rather than waiting for a grid connection because the answer we got was that we will get it by the end of the 2030s—2039—and we cannot wait until then.

Another requirement, which is very specific to us, is to get connected as early as possible to the carbon network once we start producing SAF by the end of 2029, especially when there is a unique benefit for the UK. By the way, that is very unique to the UK. No other country has a SAF mandate that is about carbon scaling and at the same time has the capability to capture CO2. That is also unique in Europe because the UK and Norway together have 75% of the carbon capture capacity in Europe. It is really very unique to the UK. Our ask is to get connected to reduce carbon intensity, provide a better price per certificate, and also pay, because we do not need subsidy for carbon capture. We are ready to pay the transport and storage costs to the Government for carbon capture. Those are the three main points.",https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/static/UK_Parliament/img/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-16 06:03:07.398061

Q29 For transparency, I should declare that I have visited Zero Petroleum on a couple of occasions and met with people there. Mr McKiernan, your product is a power-to-liquid product; it is not derived from feedstocks or waste. Do you think that a power-to-liquid solution is the long-term solution for sustainable and synthetic fuels for aviation use? Do you worry that any part of the Bill incentivises short-term solutions over long-term solutions?

Doug McKiernan: On the first part of the question, given my knowledge of the sector as an engineer, I do not believe that there is a long-term solution other than power to liquid. At the moment, in the ASTM fuel standards, there are a lot of bio-based, sugar-based and food-waste solutions. In my view, those are not truly scalable, and their cost will only ever go up, because of the shortage of land and so on. The power-to-liquid side is truly scalable. The feedstock is air, water and renewable energy. It is extremely clean, and it gives the industry the opportunity—in, say, 10 or 15 years’ time—to move to fuels that are even more performant than current fossil-based fuels.

We are very supportive of the Bill, and we think it will be useful for us if it goes through. It will give confidence to the sector and bring investment, which then helps to bring capability to the UK. It is a great way to kickstart the e-fuels industry, which is the medium to long-term solution, not a short-term solution. We have been working in this sector for only five years. Because of our education system, we probably have some of the best talent in this sector globally, and we are able to recruit that.

We have already made significant inroads into the quality of the fuel, which is over and above anything else that is now available—and when I say that, I mean globally available. This little company that we have—and it is little—has been able to outperform some of the bigger competitors in the field. Towards the end of this year, we will submit our product to the ASTM governing body to get it certified. The intellectual property that we are generating is key to the UK. We need to make sure that the IP is generated here in the UK and kept here because I believe that in five years from now all the big decisions around e-fuels—all the important ones—and the freedom to operate will have been worked out, and we do not want that to be worked out anywhere other than in the UK. It will enable us to kickstart the energy generation within the UK so that we have a sovereign capability for energy generation. I hope that answers your question.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q It does. I have one brief additional question, mindful that we have only 20 minutes with you. Off the back of that protection of UK IP, do you think the Bill could be strengthened to bring in greater protection of technologies such as those that have been developed by Zero and other companies in the UK, so that when the strike price is set it does not end up with foreign-owned technology being incentivised in the United Kingdom? Do you believe that you, along with others that have similar technologies, can scale fast enough to meet the other side of the coin of this Bill, the SAF mandate?

Doug McKiernan: That is a very good question. I think we are in a race. At the moment we need the Bill to give confidence to investors. That will help us to scale. That is the main benefit in the short term. With regard to the IP, there needs to be a mandate somewhere in Government to support core e-fuels development. A lot of small companies at the moment are not getting that, so we are at risk of going abroad with the technology. The Aerospace Technology Institute heavily sponsors hydrogen and electric, but does not really support the core technology of e-fuels. Although we have this mandate, which we think is great, there is a bit of a gap there that could do with addressing.

Luke Taylor (Sutton and Cheam) (LD) - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q You have given a really helpful view of the long-term solution. I do not think many would argue with PtL being the solution for the industry. This question is similar to one I have asked other panel members: how do other parts of Government, other levers and other enablers need to be brought in place to enable you to do what you need to do? What conditions does the Bill need to set? What do you see as the main challenges for the Government to act? You have spoken about skills. What else needs to be done in the Bill to enable you to be successful and for the Bill to achieve what it needs to achieve?

Doug McKiernan: Coming back to the IP, there needs to be some sort of support for e-fuels core technology development. That is very important. If you want e-fuels to be part of the future, we need to make sure that that research is supported in the UK and that when it is supported in the UK there is proper IP regulation of that. That needs to be mandated as part of the support from the Government.

What is happening in the aviation area is clearer cut, because you cannot get the energy density into an aircraft with hydrogen or electric, so it is kind of obvious, but I think it is a solution for a lot of the fossil-based fuels, including gasoline and diesel. I think what we will end up doing is that, if we can develop that core technology, it is then transferable to other sectors, and with that we will be able to deal with the real problem, which is the end-to-end solution of getting renewable energy to the consumer. That is the real challenge.

At the moment, we are talking about sustainable aviation fuel, but actually there is a lot of energy in the North sea that is not getting used because of the challenge of the cost of getting it from there to the consumer. This is where e-fuels come in. The Bill would help to move us in the right direction to start to tackle that problem, because you would have these companies with the new tech working out how to make that viable. There is a very good, well researched paper by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the US and the Department of Energy. It was done back in 2021.

I had a conversation with our CEO and the board one day and realised, “We’re not actually a fuels company, although we’re called Zero Petroleum and we’re making jet fuel and gasoline. We’re actually an energy transmission company, because all the problems we have with renewable energy are solved by liquid hydrocarbons”. If you look at the paper I referred to, done back in 2021, the cost of getting energy from the North sea in a cable to the consumer is probably forty to fiftyfold what it is if you wanted to do it with a liquid hydrocarbon. That is the fundamental problem that we are going to struggle with going forward. We are slowly going to morph as technology and engineering rather than policy dictate what the solution is.

Q Using carbon dioxide to produce SAF is a wonderfully seductive and brilliant solution. You are addressing the regulatory obstacles, but what are the technical obstacles?

Doug McKiernan: To be perfectly transparent with everybody, with carbon dioxide at the moment I think the direct air capture, compared with where we are, is a bit of an Achilles heel. It is probably around two to four years behind in its scale-up, in terms of being able to keep pace with our scale-up, but actually there is plenty of biogenic carbon dioxide around for large-scale commercial plants here in the UK, which could be a stepping stone to the direct air capture. A lot of the work with direct air capture at the moment talks about the cost of it; you can sequestrate the carbon dioxide in the ground. That is not what we want to do as a petroleum company; we want to put that carbon dioxide into a liquid fuel, and then it is net zero. You have carbon dioxide and water coming out of the exhaust—whether that is a turbine or internal combustion engine. If you capture the carbon dioxide again with the direct air capture, you are then net zero.

When you integrate that direct air capture with our process, the cost of direct air capture is probably reduced by 80%, because we have an exothermic reaction going on, and the majority of the cost in direct air capture is in the de-absorption of carbon dioxide. Once you have absorbed it from the air, you have to heat up the catalyst again—or the material that has absorbed it—to get the carbon dioxide out again, and we have an exothermic reaction. We would not have those costs associated with our process. Integration of our direct air capture with our power-to-liquid solution in three to four years’ time would be quite a mature technology, and definitely scalable within the UK.

Q Partly because you are based in Oxfordshire, my mind goes to universities. I wondered—based on what was said by a previous contributor—where we are with this technology compared with other countries. I do not know whether you are working with universities, but I am sure you are working with young people to develop skills. Is there is a risk, if the Bill is not passed and we did not get the RCM, that some of the skills that you are developing will be lost to other countries?

Doug McKiernan: There is no question about it. The people who we have recruited have been researching, and have done not only doctorates but post-docs in this area. They have been working in it for nine or 10 years, hoping that there was a company out there that would recruit them and turn their R&D into a reality. These people are very passionate about their career and what they want to do. They are not going to work for the money; they come to make a difference. We have recruited a lot of those people. They will go wherever the company is that will make what they want to do happen.

Q Good afternoon. You have talked about the sourcing of aviation fuel and blending SAF as well as fossil fuel for aviation. Shell is clearly a global company, but the Bill’s underpinning is the United Kingdom’s domestic fuel security. Where does Shell sit in terms of viewing domestic fuel security for aviation use within the United Kingdom? Do you think the Bill will deliver on not just that primary goal but increasing UK-based SAF production?

Ruben van Grinsven: That is a really good question. We are looking globally at various opportunities to build SAF production plants. The second and third generations especially are more challenging than the first generation. To make the investment case robust, we need to solve a whole number of challenges—some are around ensuring that we can make the technology work, and some are around financing. But a lot of it has to do with the value of the product that we make, and the certainty around the value of the product.

The revenue certainty mechanism being discussed in the Bill is very compelling. There is always a combination of different factors. It is partially fundamentals about whether we can get the right feedstocks, but part of it is also about the certainty we have about the price we are going to get for our products. The revenue certainty mechanism is absolutely very helpful.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q That is helpful, but on this particular point about UK-based production, a global company like Shell—there is nothing wrong with this position; it is what you do—will source SAF from wherever it is cheapest around the world. Does the Bill go far enough to pump-prime UK-based production so that a global giant like Shell—nothing wrong with being a global giant—will choose UK-based plants, or will the mechanism in the Bill not produce SAF at a cost that you think is competitive for your usage, blends and potential future use when compared to that from suppliers overseas?

Ruben van Grinsven: There are two elements. One is whether we can invest in a UK plant. That is hard to tell at this point in time for two reasons. We do not fully understand all the details associated with the Bill. I think the principles are very promising, but there are many things that need to be detailed out, which, at the end of the day, will decide how appealing the investment is going to be. There is a lot of that.

Can UK-produced SAF be competitive in a global market? I think that depends a little bit on the type of technology, but it is also very timebound. At this point in time, this is not the cheapest place to make e-SAF, just because power is more expensive than other places in the world. But if we continue to build out the renewables, as I have seen in plans before, I think there are going to be more affordable electrons around that can then be converted into e-SAF. In the longer term, e-SAF can be competitive.

For other technologies, I think things are less location dependent. Ethanol to jet, for instance, is very feedstock dependent, and I think that the UK can be as competitive as other places. Again, the fundamental competitiveness is one element. The other element is whether the whole investment case makes sense, and part of that is financing —and part of the financing is driven by revenue certainty. It is not just the fundamentals but the whole package that determines the attractiveness of the investment.

Q I think it is fair to say that the international supply chain is becoming more constrained and that there is a more protectionist international global economy. Can you give us a flavour of some of the economic and logistical challenges that you would face, importing SAF into the UK? As a follow on, if there is a requirement around energy security to set up shop in the UK, given the known knowns, would you look for subsidies from the current Government to set up production in the UK?

Ruben van Grinsven: I am afraid I cannot fully answer that question because it is not the part of the business that I am in. I am not importing SAF to the UK, so I do not know how trade limitations are currently impacting SAF supply. I would have to ask a colleague and come back to that question. It is also hard to predict what the future is going to bring for global trade and how protectionism will impact the global free trade of all types of fuels.

If you produce domestic fuels, that is, of course, going to be helpful if you want energy security. I must say, though, that if you look at the volumes that we are talking about today, the energy security element in the early days is going to be limited because of the volume of the fuels involved.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Mr Downie stole my question, so I will develop it a bit further. The RCM sets the levy on to the fuel producers who will likely pass it on to passengers. You operate internationally and see mechanisms being implemented elsewhere in the world. We mentioned the alternative of using the ETS to fund the RCM. How do you see the advantages of one system or the other, and where have you seen alternatives implemented elsewhere that have worked well?

Ruben van Grinsven: That is a good question. First and foremost, the UK is ahead of pretty much everybody else when it comes to developing those mechanisms. I know the EU is basically inspired by the RCM and trying to come up with a similar framework, which it will be announcing in September in the sustainable transport investment plan. I think the initial thoughts are indeed to fund that through ETS.

I do not have a strong preference between ETS-funded or levy-funded. The most important thing is that it is clear, transparent, consistent and predictable. Once we know the details and find out how the whole mechanism will work, we can perfectly live with the levy mechanism—as long as it works practically. So we do not have a strong preference between ETS or levy funding.

Q You have just mentioned that you are looking broadly at SAF production and how that is going to play out into the future. Compared with other northern European countries, the UK has excellent access to renewable energy, and we had a very early responding hydrogen industry. What do you see as the UK’s unique opportunities in SAF production?

Ruben van Grinsven: There are two elements. One is the fundamentals: affordable renewable energy, other feedstocks, then the cost of building plants, labour, and everything else. At the moment, in terms of the fundamentals of renewable electricity, the UK does not have a clear advantage because power prices are slightly more expensive, and most of the renewable power in the UK is intermittent. That is an important thing that needs to be overcome.

You have a slight disadvantage compared with, for instance, the Nordics, such as Sweden and Finland; they have a lot of hydro and stable baseload renewable power. On the fundamental side, especially for power, I think there are other places that are currently a bit more competitive. However, many of the other elements, such as feedstock supply, labour and knowledge, are quite similar.

The biggest differentiator is probably the legislative and regulatory landscape. You are creating a market through mandates, which I think is extremely powerful. If you also increase investment certainty through an RCM, that element is unique and, at this point in time, very helpful.

Chris Vince - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Obviously, the Bill is trying to make it easier for us to produce SAF in this country, which is really important. I gather—if this is correct—that part of your role is to source SAF around the world. Do you feel there will be a greater need, and therefore a strong argument that we should be pushing ahead with SAF and producing it here in Britain? Although you said you cannot commit to where you will buy your SAF because of cost, would you say you will be in a place where you need more and more—and so it is very likely that you will have to source SAF from Britain, because you will need as many sources as possible?

Ruben van Grinsven: Especially for the second and third generation, SAF needs to develop. I think the consensus is that HEFA-based SAF is, at this moment, the most mature and affordable, so it is a great option. However, we also all believe that we are going to run out of feedstock at a certain time.

If you want to continue decarbonising aviation, you need additional forms of SAF—and that is where the second and third generations come in. We need to start developing those now, to learn how it is done and establish the technology and the fundamentals behind it. Starting that now is essential, and doing it in the UK could potentially give you a head start. If you do this before everybody else, you would have a technological and commercial head start, which could be an advantage.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q If the Bill becomes an Act, Shell will find itself in a peculiar place given that it will be both a levy payer, as a fossil fuel producer, and a developer of SAF potentially looking to benefit from the strike price. The Government put an analysis in the public domain on Second Reading: they suggested that the ultimate cost to the end user, such as somebody getting a flight—there will be a different calculation for those using air freight—will be plus or minus £1.50. Witnesses earlier suggested that that might be a “conservative” estimate—in their own words. Where would Shell see the ultimate cost pass on to the end user?

Ruben van Grinsven: The principle makes sense: at the end of the day, additional cost will find its way to the end user. We do not have enough information at this point in time to calculate what the cost is going to be because a lot of the details of the Bill are unknown. We would like to better understand how this is going to work, what the volumes are, what the timing is going to be, and how we will organise the contracts between the supplier and the off-taker. There are a lot of things that we do not know at this point, and therefore it is difficult to model what the final cost of the levy is going to be for the end consumer. I do not know; it is difficult to answer.

On top of that, I think it is going to change over time. Over time, if the market is short and the prices are high, money might flow towards the levy, so it would be like a negative levy but then it might turn into a positive levy. It is very difficult to assess that and put a number on it.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Good afternoon, Mr Gorman. I will lead with the question that I asked the previous witness about end-user cost. Clearly, Heathrow’s business model relies on you having many people coming through and getting on aircraft, or arriving in the UK on an aircraft. If the cost of flying were to increase significantly, that might impact Heathrow’s very business model, with fewer people being able to take those flights. Some of the evidence we have heard today seems to challenge the Government’s presumption, presented on Second Reading, that any cost increase to the end user, as a result of the Bill and the SAF mandate, would be plus or minus £1.50. Do you share the Government’s view on that, or do you share some of the other witnesses’ views that that might be optimistic?

Matt Gorman: Let me start by saying that we take this issue very seriously, for the reasons you have outlined. It is central to our business. SAF is key to delivering the industry’s net zero transition plan: it is about 40% of the solution. I do not think that anyone can forecast the future costs and prices with exact certainty, but I will say that we test all our demand forecasts for Heathrow against a range of different carbon price scenarios, from low to high—“high” being the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero’s high scenarios. We do that because it is important for us to understand and our investors to understand, and because climate disclosure legislation now requires us to share that information in our annual report. We have concluded that demand for flying from Heathrow remains robust even in high carbon price scenarios in future. We are confident about that.

The Government have shared their analysis on the revenue certainty mechanism and the reasons behind it. That is one of the carbon costs that consumers will bear—there are clearly others—but I come back to the point that all our forecasts have shown that demand is robust.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q In respect of procurement of SAF to be available at the airport, will the Bill safeguard domestic fuel security? I ask that question largely through the lens of the challenge to Heathrow if fuel were suddenly to be unavailable in the United Kingdom for you to supply to the airlines on site. Is there any way that the Bill could be improved to shore up the domestic security position?

Matt Gorman: It is a good question. We welcome the Bill. As SAF is so important, the sector and Heathrow have advocated over a number of years both the mandate, which was passed as legislation at the beginning of the year, and the revenue certainty mechanism. It has benefits for energy security, green jobs, growth and decarbonisation. That has been one of the drivers for the sector to support it. The decarbonisation benefits are clear. On jobs and growth, earlier witnesses talked about the industry studies showing up to £10 billion of GVA and 60,000 jobs by 2050.

Energy security is one of those reasons. As SAF is a key part of the industry transition plan around the world, there will be global trading of SAF. Kerosene is a global commodity today; SAF will be in future. We think we will import some. However, the sector is supportive of domestic production, which is why we are so supportive of the Bill. I should say that Heathrow is not directly in the fuel value chain—we do not buy, make or sell fuel—but we are very involved in the debate, because it is so significant. All the fuel producers and investors we talk to say that the revenue certainty mechanism will help to unlock investment decisions in the UK. I am not sure whether the Bill could be improved to do that even more. I do not have a view on that.

Julia Buckley - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q My second question is about your role at Heathrow. We heard from earlier witnesses that, because the generation fuels are drop-in fuels, they are fairly confident that they could rely on existing infrastructure for storage and so on. As the person in charge of Heathrow, our largest airport, how confident are you that existing infrastructure and storage spaces can accommodate drop-in fuels?

Matt Gorman: Very confident, from everything we hear from fuel suppliers in this space. Looking at the different bits of infrastructure, starting briefly with aircraft and engines, the main aircraft and engine manufacturers are in the process of certifying all their aircraft to run on 100% SAF. In a sense, we do not have to worry about that problem immediately, because—apart from dedicated flights—we do not have 100% SAF flowing through pipes, but that is clearly their goal. I forget the exact dates, but I think that by the end of this decade they will all be doing it, if not before.

On pipelines and aircraft infrastructure, one of the main reasons that we have focused on SAF is that it requires upstream investment in production facilities, but it does not require changes in airport infrastructure or planes. That means that as soon as you can start producing SAF, you can start cutting carbon. As an illustration, at Heathrow, partly in anticipation while waiting for some of the Government market signals to develop and kick in, we introduced a landing charge incentive—a financial incentive. It started at 0.5% a couple of years ago, and now 3% of all the fuel being used at Heathrow is SAF, which has dropped into our systems without any issues. I should also say that 17% of the total global production of SAF is now uplifted through Heathrow.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q The SAF mandate is 10% by 2030. The EU target is much lower: 6%, I think. Our target goes up to 22% by 2040, but elsewhere the target increases more dramatically. As Heathrow is such a large user—17% is a massive component—will the mandate be achievable alongside the goals and targets set out in the Bill? You have said that other things need to be done and that this is part of a suite, but I guess the question is whether this is enough. Do you need to see more aggression and more ambition, with investment in firms through skills and through the measures we have drawn out from previous witnesses around the protection of IP? Do you see this as enough?

Matt Gorman: I think this is a very strong start from the UK. I was smiling when the Shell representative said that the EU had been inspired by the measures that the UK is taking. Joking aside, I have talked to fuel suppliers and investors to get a sense of how they are seeing the market. They say that this package, with the mandate and the revenue certainty mechanism, is a really strong policy package from the UK.

To answer your question, Heathrow has been invited by the Government to submit updated proposals for our expansion plans by the end of this month. Within them, we will be setting out our views on our future trajectory to net zero. We think that the mandate and the revenue certainty mechanism are vital. The Government have already said that they want to keep the mandate levels under review; you are right that although we are more ambitious to begin with and the EU is less ambitious, the EU takes over. Our view is that heading more in the direction of the EU’s ambition over time will be important for Heathrow and for aviation generally, but we will keep that under review.

It is really important to get started and make a strong start in this decade, to show that as well as producing SAF globally for use in the UK, as we are already doing, we can produce it in the UK.

Tom Collins - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q You have mentioned that the UK is taking a strong leadership position on this stepping-stone technology with SAF. If the UK were to prepare itself now, early on, to be in a leadership position in sustainable aviation using hydrogen, what do you think that would look like?

Matt Gorman: I think it would look broadly like what the UK is doing. We think about it in three buckets: the plane, the airport infrastructure and the regulatory environment. It is worth remembering that UK aerospace is one of the jewels in the crown of our manufacturing sector. We have a very long history in aerospace, and the Aerospace Technology Institute funds some of that technology development alongside the private sector. That is important.

With airport infrastructure, we have always said, certainly for Heathrow, that we do not want to be a blocker. We do not want a hydrogen plane to be designed but not able to fill up at our airport. We keep an active watching brief on technology developments. We have taken a stand at Heathrow to trial hydrogen technology so that we can understand and build understanding. That is partly to influence the regulatory environment so that we are supporting the roll-out of hydrogen.

The latest views from manufacturers are that we will probably start small with hydrogen—small plane sizes and small ranges—and build confidence there before getting bigger. However, that could play a real role in domestic connectivity. I think we are doing the right things, but it is a both/and with SAF and hydrogen, not an either/or. I would also say that SAF is the solution that we know exists today and that we can deploy today, so we need to get it moving.

Mr Kohler - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q First, given the obvious international aspect of aviation, does it make sense for the UK mandate and the EU mandate to diverge, or would it make more sense if they were the same? Secondly, we heard from one witness that the levy would encourage tankering, with air operators filling up in other locations. Does that happen now, and is it an issue that you can see being made worse by the levy?

Matt Gorman: On the first question, I touched earlier on the fact that the EU and the UK have taken different trajectories, certainly into the longer term. I will be a little bit careful in what I say, because we are just finalising our thinking on what we submit to the Government, but increasing ambition with SAF will be important in the UK as we build confidence in production and scale-up of the technology. We can see a case in future to be more ambitious with the UK mandate. I think the Government said that they want to keep that actively under review, which we support.

On the question of tankering, it happens to a limited extent today. We do not fly the aircraft, but our understanding, from when we last looked at it several years ago, is that on short-haul aircraft in particular, where there is a very rapid turnaround and you do not necessarily want to take time to fill up the aircraft at the other end of the route, the CO2 penalty was not huge in terms of the industry overall. I am not close enough to comment on whether the levy poses a particular challenge there, but when the Government get to the stage of consultation on the detailed design of the mechanism and are working with the industry, it will be important to design it in a way that avoids that wherever possible.

Amanda Hack - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q We talk an awful lot about the customers and what they might see on the price of their ticket, whether that is for freight or for going on holiday to Spain or wherever, but are your customers demanding that you be more environmentally friendly? As an airport, how far do you need your customers to support the transition to SAF?

Matt Gorman: It is a great question. All the evidence from our polling of customers, as well as what we read in regular polls and consumer surveys, shows that people are broadly concerned about climate change and environmental issues generally. In terms of aviation, they see that there is a role for customers, but they are clear that the industry needs to set out a plan and take action. They understand that airports do not necessarily fly planes, but that we clearly have a responsibility. They expect us to set out the plan, communicate it and take action at the airport where we can. In that sense, all the evidence shows that consumers support us taking action.

As the answer to an earlier question alluded to, the net zero transition will have some costs to consumers. The challenge is how we keep those costs as low as possible while reaching the goal of net zero. I think the balance of the mandate and the revenue certainty mechanism is well designed to achieve that. We think that domestic production in the long term so we are not reliant on imports—we have discussed the energy security angle—is a good way of helping to manage price certainty in future. Consumers are supportive, engaged and willing to pay a bit more to support the transition to net zero, but the industry and Government need to take action to manage it cost-effectively.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Green finance is something of a minefield across various technologies. A straightforward first question is whether the Bill is the most effective way to get finance into UK SAF production via the price mechanism. If the answer is no, what would be a better way of ensuring UK SAF production and the protection of UK intellectual property in that production? Where do you sit in the debate about what the ultimate cost to the end user will be?

Josh Garton: I think that the revenue certainty mechanism that is being proposed is a really good start to getting finance into the sector. Undoubtedly it will not be the only thing that is required: there are other risks that need to be addressed. The revenue certainty mechanism addresses price risk, as it is designed to, but other challenges remain for the second and third-generation fuels, and they may need to be addressed as well. I think that it is the best solution for addressing price risk. As other witnesses have described, when we speak to our colleagues in Europe and elsewhere, they see the package of regulation that the UK is proposing as some of the most promising in the world. The UK will become a very promising place to invest in SAF.

On your question about the price for the end consumer, it is very hard to forecast what that will be. There are a lot of forecasts out there. It obviously depends on the cost of production, the blending of the fuel and many other factors, but the most important thing is that the mechanism for transferring the cost to the consumer be done in a very equitable way, so that you remove any competitive advantages or disadvantages resulting from airlines and other players in the industry potentially gaming the system. I would say that that is a more critical element to consider.

Amanda Hack - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Obviously, when you are looking at green investment, there is a huge element of risk in new technologies. Are there other levers of Government that would de-risk them from an infrastructure point of view, or are there other things that we could do on top of the Bill to de-risk it?

Josh Garton: Yes, I think there are. As I said, the revenue certainty mechanism seeks to address price risk primarily. The mandate deals with volume, and it provides that volume certainty in the market. When we think of the second and third-generation fuels that we need to develop to meet the aviation decarbonisation targets, these are somewhat novel technologies—in fact, they are novel technologies—and there is no market for the fuel at the moment. That means the technologies themselves are not commercially mature yet, so even with a revenue certainty mechanism in place, there is still a level of technology risk that some investors are not willing to tolerate at this point in time.

We need further support to help the first-of-a-kind projects get through FID, even with the revenue certainty mechanism in place. That can include deploying things like first-loss guarantees, or other forms of Government involvement, such as being the first lender through something like the NWF taking a slightly more risk-on approach to the financing of these first-of-a-kind projects. That way we can prove that the technologies are commercially viable, and then help scale the sector.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q I want to be very careful with this question. We have had questions about investors and appetites to put money into these technologies—into refineries, production and particular projects. There was previously a fairly strong consensus on the need to address climate change, and this is one of the projects that we are doing to mitigate those impacts. There is a fair amount of rhetoric at the moment about stopping investment in net zero projects in particular regions, some of which have a heavy dependency on or a high frequency of these sorts of projects—north Lincolnshire, Humberside and such areas. Is there a risk that that sort of rhetoric damages investor confidence and that, with that sort of language and those sorts of pronouncements being made, we see challenges in delivering the jobs and the plants and seeing the capacity that we need come online?

Josh Garton: Yes, absolutely there is. It feeds into the overall narrative in the UK on the direction of SAF. It is more than just at the regional level; there are murmurings around the strength of the mandate itself and its being upheld. All those murmurings impact the narrative and the appetite for investors. The more we can do to support those first-generation plants to get through to a final investment decision and through to production, the better we prove out the sector as a viable one in the second and third-generation fuels. That narrative then falls away, because we have proof that it is a commercially viable product.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Good afternoon, Mr New. Fast-forwarding from your review to where we are today, is there anything that you wanted to see, that you recommended or that you found in that review, that is lacking in the Bill that this Committee is considering? If that is the case, how would you improve it—or is this the mechanism that you think will pump-prime the UK SAF industry?

Philip New: The main conclusions from the report that I did were, first, that the SAF mandate as laid out—it was at a slightly more formative stage then than it is now—was a really smart way of trying to define the market mechanisms, the targets and the obligations framing a new market. The question then was what other mechanisms would need to be in place, having got the demand side largely mapped by the mandate, to enable supply to occur.

My first thought when I saw the RCM was that there was very little that was needed: if you believe that the market will be short of SAF, as many people do, with a buy-out price and a target, you would expect the product to price close to the buy-out price—that which is available. That sends a very strong price signal to investors. I was unfortunately thinking of that from my historical perspective as a strategic investor and had underestimated the conservatism of the banking community. It was clear to me that they were pushing very hard—perhaps because they had grown very comfortable with the idea of a CFD in other parts of the green transition—and they were really enthused and insistent on the idea of a revenue certainty mechanism. The way that the RCM has emerged so far is very highly aligned with the proposals that emerged in that original report. From that point of view I would say, “So far, so good.” The mandate is evolving well and the RCM feels pretty much where it needs to be.

The questions that are still out there, as I think Josh Garton was referring to, are specific to very first-of-a-kind technologies. Part of the issue with the second-generation products is that, while the feedstocks are already wastes, they are often already being used in other sectors. There needs to be, I think, some greater degree of comfort to enable some of those wastes to be bid away without wrecking the project economics of the SAF developer. A good example is black bin waste. The prospect is that by having more competition for black bin waste, we reduce costs for local authorities. It is really nice if we can get there, but for now, while these technologies are so uncertain and regarded as such a risk, it is difficult for local authorities to commit to them with enthusiasm, because they are afraid that they will end up paying landfill fees if they do not manage to do it.

That is one example suggesting that there should be some more comfort around feedstocks. The rest of the answer are the mechanisms that could be put in place to smooth some of the risk around the very first projects. The risks there are around integrating new technologies for the first time and then getting through some of the operating teething problems, because everyone involved will be coming across those issues for the first time. It took me about four years to get a much simpler plant up and running to a point of satisfactory operation. We should not underestimate the challenges of getting those initial assets over that first set of hurdles, but the RCM is an absolutely necessary part of the mix that needs to be put in place.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q That is very helpful. As you raised, for example, the black bin waste stream, it strikes me that looking across the differing technologies to produce SAF, the waste-derived ones could end up being the most costly, not least because the bulk of waste goes through local authorities. Many of those—including my own in Buckinghamshire—are tied up in very long-term finance arrangements on incinerators, so they cannot simply take their waste somewhere else because they are locked in a contract. Buckinghamshire is by no means unique in that. Do you see waste-derived SAF hitting an even bigger buffer when the practicalities come, and it either requiring some significant state subsidy to buy out those incinerator contracts or simply not having the waste in the first place?

Philip New: When I first engaged with this, I had exactly the same thought. However, a few things are starting to emerge that sit on the more optimistic side of the balance of risk here.

First of all, over time there will be more and more pressure for the energy from waste manufacturers to access carbon capture and storage. It is not at all the cleanest way of generating an electron in this day and age. It would be reasonable to expect that over the next 15 years, we will see a number of those assets get to a point where the contracts are expiring. They will then need to contemplate refinancing, and if they do, whether or not they have access to carbon capture and storage will become important. Not all of them will be able to either afford or justify it, because they are too distant from where the carbon sinks are. There is a probability that enough capacity will start to come off stream for it to be picked up.

On top of that, the imposition of the emissions trading tax will start to free up some of the very difficult to recycle plastics, which could be used to make SAF. There is also an interesting stream of waste wood that will become available, particularly as some of the rocks start to fall away, which will start to happen in a couple of years’ time—and assets that at the moment are making renewable electricity out of waste wood will lose their rocks. We also need to remember that it is the local authority that is paying the energy from waste company to move it away.

I have recently been involved with some economic analysis. We assumed that for the first wave of sites there would be a 100% discount. In other words, rather than the local authority paying, it would get rid of the waste for free. The developer would not pay for it themselves, but the local authority would still save the money. We thought that would be necessary to give local authorities the comfort to take on the exposure. Later on, there might be scope for it to become a little more competitive, because people will get more comfortable and there will be more confidence in the technology.

I do not think that we simply have to bail them out. I think there might be something around a guarantee of some description that simply says to a local authority, “Look, if you give a contract to one of these companies and it fails—if it can’t live up to that contract—and you have to put it into landfill and pay the landfill tax, there could be some kind of keep-whole mechanism,” just to encourage them over the line.

The other thing that you could consider is looking at the waste hierarchy. Simply moving this from being recovery to recovery-plus would send a very strong signal to local authorities that putting it into SAF is a better use of their waste than simply incinerating it and turning it into electrons.

Ms Minns - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Building on that, we heard from a couple of witnesses earlier today about the waste hierarchy, but in your view, is there a point at which local authorities should be looking at their local plans for waste and minerals? My local authority is already receiving applications for gasification plants, and it is not alone in this. If they come on stream, they could deprive the SAF producers of the materials that they would want to acquire. At what point do local authorities need to be thinking ahead when looking at their waste and mineral plans?

Philip New: This is quite a challenging conundrum. Right now, the safe place to put your waste is into an incinerator to make electrons. Is that the best place for the journey to net zero or for the local authority’s long-term economics? That is less obvious. It is difficult to put all the obligation on the local authorities to make the right, wise, long-term choice, when they are dealing with some very short-term pressures. This is where I think some extra signals—whether through some kind of mechanism that gives them comfort that they will be kept whole if things do not work out as planned, or some adjustment to the waste hierarchy—could play a helpful role.

David Reed - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q You did your independent report in 2023. Obviously, the world has changed rapidly in the past couple of years. We are seeing global economic change, with tariffs, international supply chains becoming more contested, and increased conflicts and volatility. How have the conclusions that you drew in 2023 changed, and where would you say that delta is?

Philip New: I think the key change has been in the United States. When I wrote that report, it was in the context of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. The concern was that we might be out-competed by investment in America, and we would end up being a net importer of stuff from America, not just in first-generation SAFs but in second-generation SAFs. They have lower energy costs, which are very important in these sorts of industries, and their build costs are about 20% less than ours. That was a real worry then.

Especially coming out of the big, beautiful Bill, America is out of the game. That is kind of a good thing at one level, because it means that, particularly with the way the mandate is designed around second-generation SAFs, we now have a globally unique position. We could therefore become an incubator for a series of technologies that will have to play a significant role in aviation decarbonisation over the next couple of decades. The bad news is that if we fail to get this new industry kick-started, I do not think we can hope to rely on imports from somewhere else to get us out of trouble. It will mean that we will not meet our mandate targets.

David Reed - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Just a small follow-up, if I can. You are saying that the biggest change is the US pulling back from innovation and production of SAF. Is that in direct response to what the Chinese are doing?

Philip New: No. For most global markets that have started to look at SAF, the preferred mechanism has been to impose some form of mandate—even China has put in place the beginnings of a mandate mechanism. None of them are as ambitious as those in Europe and the UK, but that is the normal mechanism. The reason for that is simply that SAF costs more than aviation fuel. Left to its own devices, an airline in a very competitive industry is unlikely to voluntarily buy more SAF than it needs to buy. If it has big corporate clients that want to offset some of their scope 3 emissions and are willing to pay a premium to have their flights decarbonised, that is fine, but there is a real limit to how big, dependable and investable that market will be.

That is where America is right now, and it is because of the structure of the other incentives in the American mechanism. A critical part of that was a change in the big, beautiful Bill, in which the premium given to SAF producers was removed completely. They now get no more money than those making diesel for ground transport use, but it costs more money to make SAF. The airlines do not have an incentive to buy SAF because there is no mandate, and the producers do not have an incentive to make SAF because it costs more to make and they get less credit from the American mechanisms in place to support renewable fuels.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q As a good Liberal Democrat, I want to talk about bins again. Incineration and energy recovery facilities are broadly seen as the least worst options. If there is now an alternative, lots of us will be very interested in the opportunities for local authorities and for making conditions better for our residents. If that means cheaper bin collection, we will all be in favour.

I have questions about the big picture. It has the potential to disincentivise recycling. Does the increasing value of SAF feedstock undermine the efforts to recycle? Another, more technical question is: could plastics recycling be better diverted into this process to solve a lot of the problems we have with exporting plastics for recycling and the energy used to do that?

Many of our energy from waste facilities are now linked to heat networks. Is that bigger picture being considered—not just producing electrons, as you say, but using waste heat for district heating networks? There is a bit of additional complexity.

That leads into the bigger question of the holistic view across different Departments and the incentives that the Bill creates, which I am sure are all positive. It promotes better, more sustainable options in different Departments. Is enough work being done elsewhere for this to work within the bigger system? You have 15 minutes.

Philip New: My roots are as a fuels and energy guy, so I will not be able to respond with much expertise to the more specific questions about the waste sector. However, I will do my best by starting with the general statement that I think you are quite right that the second that waste becomes more valuable than an alternative use of that waste, you have to start questioning whether it is really waste. Funnily enough, that is more of an issue in some of the first-generation products that we are using, where the waste is becoming more valuable than virgin vegetable oils. That is a different issue, but it is very important.

In this case, as long as people either do not get anything for waste or have to pay to get rid of it, the risk of it distorting other parts of the hierarchy is manageable, particularly with a sensible degree of oversight and monitoring. I would not lose too much sleep about that. You will have to help me with the other part of the question.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q It is the broader question of how this sits within the system. The implications of this Bill are really broad in the way the incentives will come into a whole different set of markets, including agriculture, waste and local government.

Philip New: First, I challenge the suggestion that this is an incentive. I think of it more as an insurance policy. If you are a recipient of the insurance policy, if it turns out that the market price is higher than you contracted for—your strike price—you will end up paying. The counterparty will be in receipt of money from the participants in the scheme. It is not a one-way incentive.

One of the charms of the RCM is that it is nicely balanced. If you are worried that the market will go long and there will be lots and lots of lower-priced product that undermines your economics, the RCM is a great way of giving you insurance that your investors will stay whole and happy.

On the other hand, by taking it on, you are sacrificing your exposure to the upside. That is the premium you are paying. I think the balance that has been designed into the RCM is a really attractive way of keeping everyone honest while still enabling investment to flow into the sector. I do not think it should distort the underlying drivers or mechanisms.

That having been said, I worry about the range of sectors that a successful SAF industry will touch. It has the potential to touch them in a very positive way, but it is also exposed to some inadvertent—I would not call it negligent—inattention in somewhere that does not feel a very strong ownership of the space, which could really mess things up. A degree of conscious, whole-system understanding of what it takes to enable a brand-new sector to emerge, and providing some co-ordination of that, would be welcome. Whether that looks a little like mission control in the electricity transition or something else, I do not know, but something to provide more comfort would be important. It touches many parts of the economy and many Departments.

Lewis Atkinson (Sunderland Central) (Lab) - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Mr New, in your report you say that one of the key asks for industry is around confidence. We have talked a lot about revenue confidence today, but I want to go over that a little bit. You ask how the UK Government can demonstrate that they will stay the course, and I guess the core of that is political confidence.

Since your report, of course, we have had a change in Government, and who knows if there might be another one over the investment cycles we are talking about here? Could you say a little about your assessment of how a Bill—putting something in primary legislation, as this does—helps to provide the political confidence that you believe investors are looking for, and also, frankly, helps to mitigate the actions of the varying parties in Parliament as we approach this issue?

Philip New: There were two big pushes from the investment community when I was writing the original report connected with the RCM. The first was that it would just be nice to have that revenue certainty in the first place, and that is what we see in other parts of the green transition.

The other speaks directly to this point. They were very nervous that there might be a change to the mandate design, the mandate targets or something at some stage in the future, and that that would so change the market dynamics and the pricing dynamics that all their assumptions would go out of the window. They were not going to be satisfied with any number of assurances from the Government, because Governments change their minds, so they wanted a bilateral contractual arrangement, which is another feature of the RCM. A big driver of its original definition was precisely to respond to that very concern.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q It is always good to get an academic perspective on these matters. We can get locked into all sorts of technical discussions and lose the bigger picture. From your work in the UCL centre, is there an academic view—a big picture view—on which of the technologies that the Bill could support through the price mechanism to scale up production in this country has the best chance of breaking through and being a long-term solution, on a scale that will give us domestic fuel security and at a cost that will not drive commercial passengers and holidaymakers away from the airlines?

Professor Maslin: We take the very large view that the only way to make the international aviation industry net zero is by SAFs. Electric short haul—possible in the next 20 to 30 years. Hydrogen—forget it; it is never going to work and any pilot will tell you, “Not a chance.” That is just so we have that laid out there.

We need SAFs both UK-wide and globally, and we are talking, as an academic institution, with very large airlines that want to produce SAFs in their own country. As academics, my colleagues and I would not pick one technology. What you need to do is what you are doing, which is having a levy that says, “If you produce SAFs, you will then have this benefit.” Then, you will work out which technology comes to the fore, whether that happens to be alcohol production or waste. You should stay agnostic to the successful SAFs output.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q That is very helpful. You may have heard me ask previous witnesses about the cost to the end user. The Government’s analysis is that it would end up being plus or minus £1.50 on the airfare, but a succession of witnesses have not been willing to put their name to that, or even to go as far as saying that they think that that is a conservative estimate. Where does your analysis sit on that?

Professor Maslin: Our analysis is slightly different because it is looking at the industry as a whole. On the airline side, there is a worry that these costs will literally be shoved on to the airlines. Many of us do not realise that the difference between this industry and others is that it is a very narrow margin industry. If there is any change in geopolitics, companies can go bust—for example, Finnair. Airlines are worried about this levy system, not necessarily because of the extra cost, but because they are not reassured that when there is a surplus, which goes back to the actual producers, it will be then be passed back to the airline. Again, they are happy with the up and down mechanism, but there seems to be no way of shunting that back to airlines to say, “Okay, you have done well, so you can get some money back.” That is more the concern.

Adding £1 or £2 to the price of a flight does not concern the airlines from the passenger point of view—it will not put passengers off. What will put them off is when the airlines suddenly realise that if you multiply that by 550, which is the number of people in an A380, you suddenly start to bankroll quite a lot of extra money that has to be found. I am hedging my bets, so I will not tell you that it will be higher or lower than £1.50. That is a very small amount per individual, but for the companies that are trying to make aviation work and are positive about trying to move to net zero, this is the perfect time to push, as they have suddenly woken up to the fact that they are laggards.

Tom Collins - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q As someone who works in research and innovation, you will be familiar with the UK pain point, where we are often excellent at planning the technologies at low technology readiness levels, and then we lose them to that mid-level valley of death. The UK is strong in sustainable fuels at the research level; this mechanism is intended to help us to navigate through the valley of death, and to reach scale and economic viability. Do you think it is a good mechanism for that and that it will help us to break that trend in the UK?

Professor Maslin: Other levy systems that have been used in the energy sector have been very successful, so I am personally very positive about this because it gives a guarantee. We have seen what I call the solar rollercoaster: suddenly everyone has solar panels, and then suddenly all the companies go bust. What you are doing, very sensibly, is trying to level those bumps in the road. That worked for offshore wind and it should work for this, but there also needs to be support through other mechanisms, such as R&D and mechanisms designed to support small and medium-sized enterprises, so they can get the research they need, to go from “Wow! That’s a brilliant idea!” to being world leading. This is a great mechanism, but the Government need to use the other mechanisms to fund those companies to develop as well.

David Reed - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Professor Maslin, thank you for being with us today. You talked powerfully about the international nature of this technology set. If a country or business is not going through a good time, that technology might not come through the supply chain. From a UK perspective, where are the main weaknesses with the international supply chain? As a follow-on, are any hostile states actively trying to weaponise elements of that supply chain?

Professor Maslin: The first thing is that we have to work out a way of being self-sufficient in SAFs. If you want the mandate and the Bill to work, we have to have that self-reliance. The problem that is the quality, quantity and supply of SAFs around the world are highly variable. They are not as good as you think they are. We therefore need to be able to protect our own regulations by having a homegrown community.

On weaponisation, no, I have not seen any evidence that hostile states are going after SAFs at the moment, because they are a very small percentage of the aviation mix. At the international level, it would be helpful if the Chicago accords could be renegotiated so that you could tax aviation fuel internationally, even if the tax was small—$1 per tonne, or something like that—to shift the balance away from aviation fuel and towards SAFs being more accountable. I doubt that will be possible in these interesting political times, but that is the problem we have. We are able to tax aviation fuel internally but not internationally. Therefore, at the moment, there is no aviation fuel tax on international flights, which would be a really nice mechanism. Of course, you can see that as weaponising against the fossil fuel industry.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q May I start by heartily endorsing your encouragement of engineering as a career or an education? As an aeronautical engineer before I came to this place, I am available for motivational speeches whenever necessary.

From my discussions with industry on the Bill up until now, I am not quite sure that I am convinced about being agnostic to SAF production, source and mechanism. My worry is that it does not give enough ability to shape the environmental benefit of that SAF stream and to incentivise the most beneficial SAF production, such as PTL compared with the earlier gen SAFs, even 2g SAFs. Does the Bill as presented give enough of the right mechanisms to incentivise the right sort of SAFs that will be most beneficial and provide us with the greatest environmental benefit?

Professor Maslin: The Bill provides financial security for industries producing SAFs, which I think is essential. I do not think it has real tweaks to favour particular SAFs—whether you want to do that or not is another matter. The problem is that some SAFs have a better environmental signature, and they are better, but we are going to run out of those.

Ultimately, the real SAFs that we are going to be looking at globally are massive algal productions and artificial kerosene, whereby you produce huge amounts of energy, and you use water and CO2 from the atmosphere to actually create kerosene. That is extortionately expensive at this moment in time. However, as I said, if there are 14,000 planes, going up 4% per year, by 2050 you will have a very large number of planes in the air at any one moment in time. There will not be enough waste, cropland or algal stuff to produce the SAFs we need. Generations 4 or 5 will be the ones that ultimately look after the aviation industry. I would still say to be agnostic; I cannot believe I am saying this, but let the economics work its way through at the moment to see who comes out on top in the UK, and then take through the next generation.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Minister, no doubt we will be able to go through much of this on Thursday and next Tuesday, but a central feature of the debate on Second Reading was the ultimate impact on airfare payers of the price mechanism in the Bill, on top of the mandate. You were very clear at the Dispatch Box that it was plus or minus £1.50. I have no reason to doubt that, but some of the witnesses today have. Is there some more work to be done by the Department as the Bill progresses to kick the tyres on those assumptions? How confident are you that it will stand the test of time, given that multiple witnesses today have challenged that number?

Mike Kane: As the Minister, may I start by thanking all Committee members and witnesses for their time today? I think it is a great question. We have a world-class aviation sector and, if we want to stay world class, it is absolutely essential that we pass this Bill. It is part of our manifesto commitment. We introduced the mandate on 1 January for 2% on the demand side, and this now begins to give investment to the supply side.

You are absolutely right; we have to remain competitive in the aviation market if we are going to remain the third largest on the planet, and one of the most advanced. The figure we have from the departmental analysis teams is that it is plus or minus £1.50 of the price of a ticket over a year. That is less than my Bee Network bus fare, where Andy Burnham keeps the cost below £2. That is what we are looking at.

You ask how we are going to look at this. To answer in all seriousness, we are going to continue to monitor and control by managing the scale of the number of contracts we let. This gives the Secretary of State—whoever it is, from whichever party it is in the future—the power to look at what is happening and scale up or down if the market is badly distorted. We feel that there is no big impact on consumers taking their annual holiday to the south of Spain once a year. They will continue to do that unaffected.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Thank you. That is helpful. Can I also ask for your views on a couple of other areas of evidence we heard today? The first is about a point that also came up on Second Reading: the protection of UK intellectual property as contracts are let and participants come forward to take part in the price mechanism. Has the Department done any more thinking on UK IP, so that we are not just producing SAF, of whichever technology, within the United Kingdom for our own fuel security, but doing so with genuinely UK technology driving it?

Mike Kane: As we said, we are agnostic to the technology. As we let the contracts, that is where the innovation will come.

There is a wider question across Government and UK security about intellectual property, and of course we will keep in contact with our colleagues at the Department for Business and Trade who look at that. The world is looking to us at the moment, as Lahiru from EasyJet said this morning, because we are the first doing this. We want to maintain the intellectual property by being first in the world to do this and then, as the companies come forward with the innovative technology, we want to properly IP that and maintain the competitive advantage in the UK.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q This is my final question before we get to go through the Bill in detail on Thursday and next Tuesday. Accepting the agnostic position, has anything you have heard today from the various companies who have given evidence, be that global giants such as Shell, UK-based innovators such as Zero Petroleum or the companies developing SAFs from waste, changed your thinking on whether there might be emerging winners and losers, given some of the challenges that we have heard about—not least the municipal waste challenges?

Mike Kane: As the Minister leading on the Bill, I would say, “My kingdom for a chemistry degree.” Actually, Mark said something that I thought was very pertinent towards the end: we just have to allow the technology to emerge. That way, as we get to the power-to-liquids and the harder piece to do, in five, 10 or 15 years, there will be a market for it. The beauty of the Bill is that we can let contracts over five or 10 years.

Personally, even though Exxon has reservations about this measure, the only emotion I would convey to Exxon is thanks for producing this fuel now, in this country. Exxon is happy about the SAF mandate; its issue is with the revenue certainty mechanism. That is an area where, once the market is established, the Government have an exit strategy; once the market begins to work, the then Secretary of State will have ways out of it, because Government will not need to be in it once we have established it.

Tom Collins - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q We heard some of the evidence about how effective the RCM could be in light of the difference that CfDs have made. You have already explained how to manage the levers and the number of contracts allocated to get the economics right, but can you explain how that sits alongside the SAF mandate to help us to steer UK innovation and maximise the opportunities for the UK to lead in this sector?

Mike Kane: When we came into Government in July, we had two key aviation policies. The first was airspace modernisation, and we set up the UK Airspace Design Service and passed it into legislation just the other week. In addition to improving resilience in our skies, we hope that that measure will stop planes circling and allow those that currently do not fly in a straight line to fly in a straight line, which reduces the cost of fuel—to go back to the shadow Minister’s point. Lahiru from easyJet said in his evidence that the best energy is the energy we do not use, and airspace modernisation helps us with that piece.

The second part of our manifesto commitment was SAF. After we were elected, we laid the mandate for 2% of all aviation fuel in the UK to be SAF. That came into force on 1 January. Airlines are sourcing SAF and getting supplies of it, but too much of it comes from abroad. While we have a good industry in the UK, companies need the confidence to scale it up.

I will make no party political points, but four or five years ago we were promised that by 2025 five plants would be up and running. If I were going there, I would not be starting from here, but we are getting on with doing this now. I think everyone on this Committee can be extraordinarily proud that this will be the moment that we stepped up and began to decarbonise the aviation industry.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q I have one straightforward question, and one that is a little more spiky. First, we have heard a lot about the need to work across Government to ensure that we get the most effective outcome from the Bill. From all the evidence we have heard, it seems to be the right thing and structured well, but how do we ensure that municipal waste streams match up with incentives for heat networks, waste hierarchies and that sort of stuff? We hear a lot about mission-based Government—is that what will give the advantage to being able to co-ordinate across Departments? Will you give us an account of what you are doing so far to pull those Departments and different groups together to make sure it works?

Mike Kane: To get any Bill this far, as any Member will know, it has to have consent right around Government. The Government know exactly what we are doing in a joined-up way. To answer your mission question, we have said that we want to be a clean energy superpower, and this Bill helps us to do exactly that. It gives us sovereign capability here on UK shores to do that; not only is that the right thing to do, but, in the increasingly uncertain geopolitical situation we face, it is becoming almost essential.

The other mission that we have is growth. Today, I heard some very big figures on what that could mean. Our Department figures show at least £5 billion GVA added if we do this, and about 15,000 jobs—[Interruption.]

Luke Taylor - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Thank you, Mr Pritchard. Minister, your first answer was very helpful. My second question is on a theme that I have brought up a couple of times, and which echoes the evidence around ETS funding from a couple of the witnesses. I am going to be a bit pointed, but if you had had the choice and the permission from the Treasury to get the funding from the ETS, rather than passing it on to firms and then passengers, would you have seen that as an optimal solution, in these constrained times?

Mike Kane: As the departmental Minister, I want to avoid the pitfall of commenting on Treasury policy, but I did hear some earlier evidence that £500 million came in from the ETS. What did they get back for it? Well, £2.3 billion of investment in the ATI, which is looking at engine capacity, hydrogen and reduced noise technologies. We are investing more than we ever have in that area. We are also now aligning, or are in negotiations to align, our ETS with the European Union. That would give us a bigger market, and therefore help aviation in this space.

In addition to the £2.3 billion, the Chancellor recently announced £63 million for the advanced fuels fund. The Government are putting their money where their mouth is. As part of the work that I have done this year to restart our confidence in aviation, I set up the jet zero taskforce, which is jointly chaired by me and the Minister for Industry, my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon West (Sarah Jones), at DBT. There is an awful lot of joined-up thinking in this area.

Amanda Hack - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q In terms of SAF’s growth potential, I would be interested to hear more about how smaller organisations can get involved and how we can ensure that lots of businesses benefit from this huge step forward for our economy. A lot of SAF production will be in coastal areas, but my constituency, which has an airport, is inland. How can that growth potential reach all parts of the UK?

Mike Kane: Indeed, and Amanda, you are a great champion of East Midlands airport in your constituency—I have Manchester airport in mine, and I see from day to day the benefits that growth brings in terms of jobs, skills and inward investment. You make exactly the right point. Good strategy is turning what you have into what you need to get what you want.

We have industrial heartlands dotted right across our nation, including in our coastal communities. They are almost oven-ready to host the technology, inward development and jobs. Our analysis, which was a minimum compared with those of everybody else in the room, is that this would create 15,000 jobs in the next few years and £5 billion in GVA. Those jobs are in many of our run-down coastal communities and industrial heartlands, so this is a win-win on many levels—in terms of decarbonisation, carbon capture, production and the regeneration of parts of our nation that have been left behind for far too long.

Mr Kohler - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q I do not know whether you have seen it, but Valero makes the point in its written submission that if the way that you calculate the levy is too complex, and if you base it on historical market data rather than current data, then with just a standard levy, that will produce problems, whereby new entrants will not be subject to the levy. We have to be sensible about how we calculate the levy. That is all I am suggesting. Do you recognise that as an issue?

Mike Kane: The first thing I would say in response to your question, Paul, is that this is a very technical, short Bill, but there are huge challenges ahead. I want to compliment my officials, who have worked extraordinarily hard to get to this point, and also industry who have worked with us to get to this point. As we go to the strike price and the levy, we will continue to work with industry to make sure we get that right.

Somebody described it earlier—I think it was Mark again—as being like a seesaw. It will go up, it will go down; but by letting the contracts or drawing them in, we can keep that balance in equilibrium, as far as humanly possible. That is the quality of this. While that is not the answer you might want to hear about the end piece, there will be scrutiny of the Secretary of State and of this, and of the legislation, and that will be covered by the Competition and Markets Authority. There will be many levels of scrutiny of how well Government are delivering this.

Graeme Downie - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q This question has come up in some of the other discussions today, but do you think there is enough in the Bill to properly incentivise the move beyond first and second generation SAFs, into what I think some of the witnesses described as the ultimate place we want to end up in—and where there is probably the most opportunity for UK IP, UK innovation and subsequently UK jobs and growth—such that the UK is where SAF happens and is created, as well as where it is developed in future? Do you think there is enough in the Bill for that? How do you see the Bill, and the next steps after that, as making sure that we can really achieve that and ensure that proper added value for the economy, while meeting climate targets?

Mike Kane: First, you are a great champion for Edinburgh airport in your constituency. You know the value of aviation to local communities in particular and you have championed that since you have been here.

Does the Bill give you innovation? I am not sure it does. I think it gives you a platform for what you want to do, in terms of the contracts that we will let going forward, which are about going from HEFA and first generation, to second and third generation. This gives you the substructure to build that capacity for intellectual property, inviting bids for various ways of doing things, and then protecting and supporting that, and bringing new entrants into the market. I think that is what the Bill does.

Lewis Atkinson - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q I am neither a chemist nor an aviation policy expert, so I will ask my questions from the perspective of my constituents in Sunderland. Looking at this policy area, they would be interested in the potential impacts on jobs and airfares. On jobs, could you say a little more about what you think the potential upside is in areas like mine? On airfares, can you confirm that clause 10, which deals with the payment of potential surpluses back to levy payers, creates the potential for downward pressure on airfares, depending on where the strike price ends up?

Mike Kane: First, you have been a big supporter of sustainable aviation fuel in your constituency, because you have the Wastefront tyre-to-fuel plant, so your constituency is already benefitting from jobs that have been created by that company. The Bill also allows us to scale up the technologies that we want to use, which could be of particular benefit to the north-east. I am also the maritime Minister, and we have announced £1 billion investment at the Port of Tyne for LS Cables, and Teesport is about to announce big investments in sustainability as part of our clean energy mission. The mayor, Kim McGuinness, is absolutely tied into this agenda, and using the whole north-east coast to support our green energy mission is vital.

You are absolutely right that the pressure on ticket prices could be downward. Very recently, there was an article in The Sunday Times by the International Airlines Group, which hedged its SAF supplies a long time ago in advance of this. It says that it will now, as an airline, have a competitive advantage in the price of ticketing over the next few years, because it got SAF at the right price at the right time.",https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/static/UK_Parliament/img/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-16 05:01:05.200257

While SIA’s decarbonisation ambitions get a formidable lift from the Temasek ecosystem, the airline needs to keep up its ambitions and improve transparency to reduce its exposure to climate risk.
That is also far short of the pace required to hit SIA’s target on sustainable aviation fuel adoption.
A World Economic Forum report on aviation sustainability argued that alignment of sustainable aviation fuel policies across regions and sustained subsidies is “crucial for encouraging investment and ensuring consistent sustainable aviation fuel adoption across regions”.
A long-term investor with deep pockets like Temasek can be extremely helpful for SIA’s decarbonisation ambitions, because of the possibility of an ecosystem approach to decarbonisation.","[SINGAPORE] A small tweak in Temasek’s latest sustainability report reveals just how much a single airline can weigh on a portfolio’s emissions.

The Singapore investment company’s sustainability report for fiscal 2025 showed total portfolio emissions flat at about 21 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e). But this year, Temasek broke down that total to show how much is attributable to a single company: Singapore Airlines (SIA), in which Temasek holds a 53 per cent stake.

Singapore Airlines makes up only about 2.5 per cent of Temasek’s S$434 billion net portfolio value, yet accounts for about 43 per cent of its total portfolio emissions. The 9 MtCO2e of emissions attributable to the SIA stake in FY2025 is more than the 8 MtCO2e attributed the year before.

Without SIA, Temasek’s portfolio emissions would have been reduced to 12 MtCO2e in FY2025 from 13 MtCO2e previously. Temasek said it is providing the with-and-without-SIA breakdown to recognise that the airline “follows a different decarbonisation trajectory from the rest of the portfolio”.

The aviation sector is especially burdensome on investors’ portfolio emissions, since systemic problems mean that individual airlines have only so much control over their pace of decarbonisation. While SIA’s decarbonisation ambitions get a formidable lift from the Temasek ecosystem, the airline needs to keep up its ambitions and improve transparency to reduce its exposure to climate risk.

Green headwinds

Two targets are key to SIA’s greenhouse gas emissions ambitions. The first is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from operations by 2050, and the second is to use sustainable aviation fuel for 5 per cent of total fuel requirements by 2030.

A quick glance at SIA’s reporting of those decarbonisation targets might leave an investor with the impression that the airline’s progress is just fine. SIA said it is “on track” for those targets. A company spokesperson explained that the on-track determination is “based on the implementation of key initiatives within our decarbonisation and sustainability road map, as well as regular assessment of our progress”.

But being “on track” on initiatives hasn’t translated to significant progress on actual emissions and sustainable aviation fuel adoption outcomes.

In the six years from FY2019 – SIA’s last full pre-Covid reporting period – to FY2025, SIA’s total Scope 1 and 2 emissions have risen 4 per cent, which is not in the same direction as net zero. SIA did reduce emissions intensity as measured by kilogramme of carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne-kilometre of carried load (kgCO2e/LTK) by just over 1 per cent during that period, but that’s still short of what’s required to get to net zero by 2050.

In terms of sustainable aviation fuel adoption, SIA bought 2,104 tonnes of neat sustainable aviation fuel in FY2025, which represented about 0.04 per cent of total fuel used for flight operations that year. That is also far short of the pace required to hit SIA’s target on sustainable aviation fuel adoption.

If the current pace of decarbonisation is in fact aligned with SIA’s planned emissions reduction strategy, the airline will have to significantly accelerate its pace of decarbonisation in the coming years to meet its targets.

There are a few reasons that decarbonisation is so challenging for SIA.

Hard fuellings

One of the biggest hurdles to decarbonisation for airlines is sustainable aviation fuel, on which the bulk of the industry’s emissions ambitions lie. At the moment, this fuel is significantly undersupplied and expensive.

Ramping up production is complicated by the need for biowaste feedstock – it’s the use of biowaste to produce the fuel that reduces the fuel’s life-cycle carbon footprint. The potentially overwhelming demand for that feedstock raises questions about unintended negative impact on land use, as farmers might clear more land or switch away from certain food crops.

By some estimates, sustainable aviation fuel could remain two to three times more expensive than normal jet fuel all the way to 2030.

Insufficient credit

The slow development of the sustainable aviation fuel market could, in theory, be mitigated by an industry-wide market-based carbon credit framework to help airlines offset new emissions above a 2019 baseline. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia) is currently implemented only for flights between voluntarily participating countries – which includes Singapore – but will become mandatory for all International Civil Aviation Organization member states from 2027.

That mandatory phase is expected to drive a surge in demand for Corsia-certified carbon credits. Various estimations suggest that demand could grow from between 100 million and 182 million credits in the voluntary phase to between 502 million and 1.6 billion units in the mandatory phase, said a Norton Rose Fulbright analysis. Supply will have to “significantly increase”, the law firm added.

All systems slow

Another major problem for airlines is that the pace of decarbonisation is not entirely within the control of each individual carrier.

For example, the high cost of sustainable aviation fuel places any early-bird airlines at peril if they can’t keep prices competitive. That makes it difficult for individual airlines to commit to long-term offtake agreements for this fuel, even though achieving economies of scale for it requires critical mass.

Systemic change at the industry and – perhaps more importantly – policy levels is essential to bring about change. A World Economic Forum report on aviation sustainability argued that alignment of sustainable aviation fuel policies across regions and sustained subsidies is “crucial for encouraging investment and ensuring consistent sustainable aviation fuel adoption across regions”.

Bottom line

All of these challenges exist because SIA operates in a hard-to-abate sector.

In the short term, falling short on decarbonisation isn’t going to have a material impact on the airline’s bottom line, especially if the rest of the industry’s in the same boat. The value of SIA’s stock isn’t going to fall because the airline isn’t adopting sustainable aviation fuel as quickly as intended. In fact, it might even increase if slow adoption means that costs and prices remain competitive.

But investors with longer horizons will have concerns about the airline’s exposure to climate risks. Disruptive transition risks could manifest if desperate policymakers raise carbon prices or clamp down on aviation emissions faster than the aviation industry and its customers manage. Climate change could increase the risk of flight disruptions. The negative impact of climate change on economic growth could be a drag on air transport.

But for long-term capital, divesting from airlines such as SIA won’t help an important player in an important sector – air travel creates and enables substantial social and economic benefits – to decarbonise. It is much better to continue engaging and assisting the airlines.

Of course, Temasek’s stake in SIA also represents a strategic national interest in the iconic national airline, which means that Temasek isn’t going to drop SIA just to hit a portfolio emissions target.

A long-term investor with deep pockets like Temasek can be extremely helpful for SIA’s decarbonisation ambitions, because of the possibility of an ecosystem approach to decarbonisation.

For instance, Temasek’s fully owned GenZero, an investment platform dedicated to accelerating decarbonisation, has been working to develop sustainable aviation fuel solutions, with an investment in US sustainable aviation fuel production specialist CleanJoule and with its founding of the Green Fuel Forward initiative with WEF to help scale up production of this fuel. GenZero has also invested in carbon market solutions such as BeZero Carbon, a carbon ratings agency.

SIA is fortunate to enjoy that support from its major shareholder. Of course, long-term shareholders have a role to play in using their votes to ensure that the company remains committed to ambitious decarbonisation goals.

It’s also important for the company to continue improving transparency about its progress. Measuring performance against targets based on the “implementation of key initiatives” without considering actual emissions and sustainable aviation fuel adoption outcomes makes it more difficult for investors to correctly understand the challenges faced by the company.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/c3050f3794c066e97890cdd835f32cdb954c3eee925a81309082eac3142efd0a?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-07-15 23:05:29.794085

Airlines, financial institutions and other associated businesses should stop using the term “sustainable aviation fuel” to describe fuels being touted as greener alternatives to fossil kerosene to power aircraft, argues a report by UK non-profit Opportunity Green.

SAF is used as a catch-all phrase to refer to various fuels with differing climate impacts. These include biofuels derived from waste or virgin feedstocks and synthetic kerosene produced using green hydrogen, which is also called e-SAF.

Instead, companies should label them as “alternative fuels” and include information on their full lifecycle environmental impacts, the report argues.

The use of the collective term SAF implies that all the fuels have a similar environmental impact, which could result in consumers being misled and leave businesses open to legal risks associated with greenwashing, Opportunity Green says.

Despite it looking increasingly unlikely that an EU Green Claims Directive will ever see the light of day, the bloc’s Unfair Commercial Practices Directive already prevents companies from providing false or incomplete information about a product to consumers and includes articles on green claims.

Similarly, the EU directive on “empowering consumers for the green transition” prohibits “sustainable” from being used as a generic claim to demonstrate environmental performance without the inclusion of a product’s social performance.

In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority has the power to fine companies misleading consumers, including through greenwashing, under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act, which came into force in April.

Both the UK and the EU have adopted mandates that require airlines to increase the proportion of SAF they use in their fuel mix up to 2040 and 2050 respectively, until it makes up a majority of the fuel used.

These mandates “do not negate the legal obligations under consumer protection law”, the report insists.

Both the UK and the EU mandates exclude biofuels produced using virgin crops. These fuels can cause significant environmental damage as they have a high risk of leading to deforestation or land degradation, and in some cases produce 10 per cent more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional jet fuel, Opportunity Green says.

However, many countries such as the US and China continue to include virgin biofuels in their SAF mandates, with Norway being the only other nation to adopt a mandate restricting it, the report finds.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/2b8fd404-488e-4525-b5d2-4f5ec21fc735.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 21:01:14.704981

For this purpose, the ""PtX-Wind"" project was launched under the H2Mare lead project. A corresponding modular plant was installed on a barge and lies operational at anchor in Bremerhaven. Later this year, it will start producing synthetic fuel directly on the sea just off Helgoland Island.

The first floating test platform demonstrating a complete power-to-X process chain for synthetic fuels was opened on July 08, 2025 under the H2Mare hydrogen lead project. ""We wanted to test the entire planning process including approval, construction, and real-world operation of the plant to learn how to draw up concepts for building larger production platforms,"" said Professor Roland Dittmeyer, Head of KIT's Institute for Micro Process Engineering and coordinator of the ""PtX-Wind"" H2Mare project during the opening ceremony in Bremerhaven.

Fuels from wind, water, and air

For the production of synthetic fuels, the novel modular plant will use wind energy, seawater, and ambient air. Accordingly, the H2Mare test platform is equipped with a direct air capture plant (DAC) for recovering CO2 from the ambient air, a facility for the desalination of seawater, and a high-temperature electrolysis unit that generates hydrogenous synthesis gas. The latter will be used as source material for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis that converts green hydrogen and CO2 into fuels.

Thanks to the modular structure of the system, the entire process chain can be operated off-grid in a dynamic way, adapted to the availability of renewable electricity from offshore wind energy.

Offshore operation starting in July 2025

The researchers will start test operations of the platform in July 2025, at first in the port of Bremerhaven and then continuing on the open sea off Helgoland. Besides testing the flexible operation of the entire process chain, they also intend to investigate the maritime impacts and material properties as well as the regulatory conditions in actual operation without connection to the power grid. The insights gained here will be incorporated into the development of larger production platforms that can be coupled with wind turbines.

Apart from the offshore production of e-fuels, the ""PtX-Wind"" researchers in the H2Mare project will also explore alternative Power-to-X synthesis methods. This includes the production of liquid methane, methanol, and ammonia, which is being investigated at KIT.

This historic journey from London Heathrow to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York marks a pivotal moment in aviation history, demonstrating the potential for a more sustainable future. As the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, the success of this flight offers hope and sets a new standard for future air travel. But what exactly does this mean for the future of aviation, and how can it impact our fight against climate change?

The Power of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

SAF, or Sustainable Aviation Fuel, is revolutionizing the aviation industry by providing a viable alternative to traditional fossil-based jet fuel. Composed primarily of used cooking oils and animal fats, SAF represents a more sustainable option that significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The fuel used in this historic flight was a blend of Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and a small percentage of Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), derived from plant sugars and other renewable sources.

Virgin Atlantic’s successful use of SAF underscores its potential as a safe and reliable substitute that is fully compatible with existing aircraft engines and infrastructure. This innovation not only paves the way for reducing aviation’s carbon footprint but also aligns with global goals to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The airline’s achievement sends a clear message: sustainable alternatives are not just feasible—they are crucial for the future of aviation.

Addressing the Impact of Contrails

While the reduction of carbon emissions is a significant milestone, the aviation industry also faces challenges related to contrails—those streaks of cloud that aircraft leave in their wake. According to research cited by Virgin Atlantic, contrails contribute to 57% of aviation’s impact on global warming. This far exceeds the 2.4% attributed to CO2 emissions from fuel combustion.

The flight from London to New York also served as a platform for the Rocky Mountain Institute’s Contrail Impact Task Force (CITF) to conduct practical tests aimed at understanding and mitigating the climate impact of contrails. By sharing data from these studies with aviation companies worldwide, the group hopes to develop strategies that will further minimize aviation’s environmental footprint. The potential to address contrails represents a significant opportunity to advance climate goals and enhance the sustainability of long-haul flights.

A critical solution in this ambitious endeavour is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). While Europe and North America have been leading the charge with supportive policy frameworks, the Asia Pacific region is increasingly recognising SAF’s vital role and beginning to implement its own strategies.

Global Momentum and APAC’s Emerging Policy Landscape

Global policy frameworks are now translating this recognition into clear mandates and incentives that drive demand and attract investment.

With nearly 40% global aviation located in APAC, the region is uniquely positioned to benefit from the use of SAF in aviation decarbonisation. More importantly, this region holds the potential to contribute approximately 40% of future global SAF production by 2050, presenting a significant economic opportunity for new producers.

These policy developments are already spurring concrete action. Japan’s 10% SAF target already spurred plans for SAF production facilities by three companies, and Korea’s SAF Expansion Strategy led to four refiners announcing joint plans for SAF plants. Additionally, many APAC countries are now providing funding through production incentives or research grants, such as Japan’s production tax credit of ¥30 per litre of SAF produced and sold, and Australia’s A$250 million under the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.

In addition to the above targets, Japan’s Green Transformation (GX) strategy is targeted to raise significant investment for domestic SAF manufacturing.

While encouraging, more ambitious and clearer future plans are needed if the aviation sector is to meet its net-zero goal by 2050.

“Supporting policies are crucial,” Steven Bartholomeusz, Head of Public and Regulatory Affairs, Asia Pacific, Neste explains, “As they create the demand certainty needed to attract investment in new production, reduce aviation’s climate impact, and ensure a level playing field for airlines in a highly competitive environment.” He stresses that governments must provide clear direction and emphasize the urgency of this transition to further support the private sector.

Navigating Challenges in Unlocking APAC’s Untapped Potential

Despite its immense potential, the region currently lacks widespread mandated demand or incentives for SAF uptake, making any current use purely voluntary. Consequently, SAF availability is limited, and its cost remains high, posing significant hurdles for airlines operating in a highly competitive market with a fragmented regulatory landscape.

Hélène Burger, Head of International Cooperation & Sustainability APAC, Airbus Singapore emphasises the critical need for governments in the region to establish clear policies and ambitions, both on the supply and the demand side. This clarity will provide the necessary visibility for both potential SAF investors and airlines, fostering the development of SAF production and enabling economies of scale. This is particularly crucial given that unlike the more unified regulatory blocs of Europe or the USA, APAC’s fragmented landscape necessitates a progressive harmonisation of regulations to ensure a fair competitive environment for all stakeholders across the SAF supply chain.

Industry Leadership: From Production to Aircraft Compatibility

Driving SAF adoption requires a unified approach across the entire industry.

Neste, driven by its purpose to create a healthier planet, has been a frontrunner in investing in renewable fuels since the 2000s, becoming the world’s leading producer of SAF. Recognising APAC’s strategic importance and growing demand for greener fuels, Neste invested €1.6 billion in expanding its Singapore refinery in 2023, making it the world’s largest renewable diesel and SAF refinery by capacity. Furthermore, it became a shareholder in the Changi Airport Fuel Hydrant Installation company (CAFHI) and established an integrated SAF supply chain into Singapore Changi Airport in May 2023, enabling SAF availability to airlines operating in the region.

For Airbus, SAF is a crucial enabler for achieving the industry’s 2050 net-zero goal. Currently, all Airbus aircraft can operate with up to a 50% SAF blend, and Airbus is working towards 100% SAF capability by 2030. Beyond technical validation, Airbus also has launched several initiatives to support the development of a SAF ecosystem, such as SAFFA (SAF Financing Alliance), Airbus Book & Claim Demonstrator (ABCD), active engagement with industry players on supply chain challenges, and feedstock certification efforts for CORSIA to promote collaborative SAF expansion.

Conclusion: Unlocking APAC’s Full Potential

As the APAC region increasingly embraces SAF as a crucial tool for aviation decarbonisation, the development and implementation of robust and ambitious government policies is paramount in unlocking its full potential. The combined efforts of leading producers, and manufacturers are essential to ensure supply stability and technological compatibility. By attracting the necessary investments and harmonising regulations, APAC stands poised to achieve a sustainable future for air travel, transforming a critical challenge into a significant economic and environmental opportunity.",https://www.asiandownstreamsummit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Insights-from-Airbus-and-Neste-1.png,N,,2025-07-15 21:01:25.304563

The partnership demonstrates both companies’ commitment to accelerating greenhouse gas emissions reduction from air cargo transportation.

The agreement encompasses the supply of 7,400 tonnes, equivalent to 9.5 million litres, of neat, unblended Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ to DHL Express at Singapore Changi Airport. The supply arrangement will commence in July 2025 and represents a significant milestone in sustainable aviation fuel adoption across the Asia-Pacific region.

As part of the global partnership focused on decarbonising air and road transport, Neste will provide DHL Express with CORSIA-eligible SAF produced locally at its refinery in Singapore. The Singapore facility operates as the world’s largest SAF production facility, providing the scale and reliability necessary to support major commercial aviation operations. The supply agreement extends for one year, from July 2025 to June 2026, providing both companies with operational certainty while supporting long-term sustainability objectives.

The volume of SAF procured under this partnership represents one of the largest purchases by DHL in the Asia-Pacific region and marks DHL’s first direct procurement of SAF for flights departing from Singapore to destinations across Asia and the Americas. This procurement strategy enables DHL to directly control its sustainable fuel supply while supporting its global decarbonisation commitments.

Neste will deliver the SAF blended with conventional jet fuel directly into Changi Airport’s fuel distribution facilities, utilising the company’s integrated supply chain from its Singapore refinery. This integrated approach ensures efficient fuel delivery while maintaining the quality and reliability standards required for commercial aviation operations. The purchased SAF will account for approximately 35% to 40% of the overall fuel blend composition, representing a substantial proportion of sustainable fuel in the mixture.

The SAF supply is designated specifically for DHL Express’ five Boeing 777 freighters based at DHL’s South Asia Hub located at Changi Airport. These aircraft depart from the airport 12 times per week, providing regular cargo services across the region. The consistent flight schedule ensures efficient utilisation of the sustainable fuel supply while maximising the environmental benefits of SAF adoption.

Christopher Ong, MD for DHL Express Singapore, emphasised the significance of the partnership in achieving new strides in emissions reduction for air transport. He highlighted how the agreement strengthens DHL’s commitment to customers by providing more sustainable shipping options. Ong positioned DHL Express as one of the largest users of SAF globally, leading the way toward more sustainable logistics while driving voluntary demand for SAF adoption. He noted that the company is not just meeting industry standards but setting them through proactive sustainability initiatives.

Carl Nyberg, Senior VP, commercial, renewable products at Neste, expressed excitement about expanding cooperation with DHL to Singapore, recognising the city-state’s position as a leading aviation hub in the Asia-Pacific region. Nyberg highlighted how the partnership leverages Neste’s SAF production and supply capabilities in Singapore while demonstrating the companies’ global collaboration to help DHL achieve its air transportation decarbonisation targets using solutions available at scale today.

The agreement supports Singapore’s broader environmental objectives, specifically contributing to the country’s target to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector. Singapore has established a goal of achieving 1 percent SAF use on all passenger and cargo flights from 2026 onwards, and this partnership directly supports the achievement of this target while demonstrating the commercial viability of SAF adoption at scale.

The partnership represents a significant development in sustainable aviation fuel deployment across the Asia-Pacific region, where SAF adoption has historically lagged behind other global markets. By securing direct supply from local production facilities, DHL Express demonstrates how logistics companies can integrate sustainable fuel solutions into their operations while supporting regional sustainability objectives.

The agreement also validates the commercial viability of large-scale SAF production and supply arrangements, providing a model for similar partnerships between fuel producers and aviation operators. The success of this arrangement may encourage additional investment in SAF production capacity and supply infrastructure across the region, supporting broader industry transition to sustainable aviation fuels.

Neste’s ability to supply substantial volumes of SAF from its Singapore facility demonstrates the company’s strategic positioning in the global SAF market and its commitment to supporting aviation decarbonisation efforts.

by Kelly Barraza

The way to a Mainer’s heart is through their stomach — appropriate for this New England state abundant in food and agricultural resources.

Slated to open in spring of 2026, the plant will source locally grown russet potatoes for the production of their chips, which will be well supplied by the $1.3 billion Maine potato industry that in 2022 supported over 6,000 jobs and $237 million in labor income, according to the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service.

Plans for the plant were first announced in early 2024 by local businessman Bruce Sargent and Jim Pelkey of Falcon Transportation in Presque Isle, Maine. Sargent spoke to Site Selection about the project and this area of Maine, indicating how bullish the city of Limestone and the Loring Development Authority have been in revitalizing business at the 3,800-acre base. The growing business roster there now includes established and prospective projects such as a sustainable aviation fuel facility from DG Fuels, an AI startup and investment group Green 4 Maine.

Big Plans for Limestone

Sargent’s early exposure to the local Maine potato and agriculture business before his 40-year-long career in refrigerated freight transportation clearly left roots that will help boost the ambitious project through its development phase.

“I’m up for the challenge,” he says. “There’s always room for the little manufacturer. I don’t worry about the competition.”

Initially operating independently, Sargent plans to scale the plant’s production with eyes on a potential partnership with larger food and beverage entities in order to deliver his product across the United States.

“I want to put out a good product, and I want to put it out fast at a high volume,” Sargent says of Taste of Maine Potato Chips’ future distribution plans. “Private label and co-pack is my object — selling to franchises like Publix, Food Lion.”

The Loring Development Authority and City of Limestone were noted for their collaboration with industry to build out Loring Commerce Centre, with Limestone open to offering 20- and 30-year tax increment financing (TIF) and other duty-free options to new businesses looking to grow in the area.

The facility’s location in Maine, where the potato is one of many crops farmed on a large scale, is strategic in avoiding the need to import potato crop from other states like Idaho and Washington. This is vital for reducing freight cost and managing shrinkage rate in the food manufacturing process. It also allows Taste of Maine to work directly with local Maine farmers.

The Taste of Maine factory will fry potato slices in batches with each industrial fryer having a capacity of 500 pounds of finished product per hour. A total of eight fryers are planned at full build-out.

Repurposing an Air Force Base

The potato chip plant is just one of many in-progress and recently completed projects at Loring Commerce Centre.

In November 2024, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) company DG Fuels announced a $4 billion, 1,200-acre SAF facility at Loring Commerce Centre expected to break ground in 2026. This location is planned to have a yearly output of 190 million gallons of jet fuel derived from 1.7 million tons of wood biomass. There is discussion on whether inactive rail in northern Maine will be repurposed for this operation, as DG Fuels has worked with the Maine Department of Transportation to identify existing rail that may be used to transport biomass from Limestone to Loring across Aroostook County. DG Fuels has also indicated interest in using an existing pipeline to carry SAF from Loring to coastal Maine for distribution at airports on the Eastern Seaboard.

“This project, when completed, would represent a big part of the vision that the state has always had for Loring,” stated then-Loring Development Authority of Maine Board Chair Jeremy Fischer in 2022, noting that the potential impact cannot be overstated in terms of jobs and increased economic activity in the area. “Thanks to all who have brought their efforts to bear to make this a reality and thanks in advance to those whose contributions have yet to be made.”

Green 4 Maine, based in Portland, Maine, is also working with DG Fuels to build workforce housing in Loring to support the project construction. DG Fuels is also planning several sustainable fuel facility projects across the U.S., including in Nebraska and Minnesota (see the January 2025 issue of Site Selection).

In a push for climate accountability, Air France-KLM has become the first airline group to adopt the European Union’s new Flight Emissions Label (FEL), developed in partnership with the European Commission and EASA.

The label, aimed at standardising emissions data for passengers, marks a significant step toward transparent, climate-conscious air travel across the EU.

Under a Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) signed with EASA, Air France and KLM will now begin testing and implementing the fully digital FEL platform.

The tool aims to offer passengers clear, consistent information on the carbon emissions associated with each flight. This will not only empower consumers to make more sustainable travel choices but also encourage airlines to adopt more environmentally responsible practices.

The partnership is seen as the first concrete manifestation of Regulation (EU) 2024/3170, adopted in December 2024, which formally established the voluntary environmental labelling scheme.

The FEL is part of a broader EU strategy that includes the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, both of which are designed to accelerate decarbonisation within the aviation sector.

New levels of transparency in airline carbon reporting

Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air France-KLM, describes the agreement as a critical milestone in the group’s climate strategy.

“Our early and active participation is designed to help shape a fair, transparent, and effective framework for all airlines.” he says. “This initiative is a critical component of our broader strategy to lead the decarbonisation of our industry.”

Air France-KLM will now work closely with EASA’s digital experts to test the FEL platform’s end-to-end workflow-from submitting flight-level data to receiving emissions label outputs.

This includes reporting real-time metrics such as fuel consumption, sustainable fuel (SAF) use, passenger load, cargo carried, and time spent airborne.

In return, the airline group will gain early access to the FEL’s reporting methodology and its underlying calculation framework, giving it a competitive edge and positioning it as a frontrunner in sustainable aviation.

What the Flight Emissions Label hopes to achieve

The introduction of the FEL arrives at a moment of increasing climate pressure.

Aviation accounts for around 3% of global carbon emissions, and that figure is expected to grow without intervention. For decades, carbon offset schemes and voluntary emissions calculators have existed, but these have often lacked uniformity and credibility.

The new labelling framework will change that. By standardising emissions data and display formats, the FEL gives consumers trustworthy, comparable information. Only airlines enrolled in the scheme will be permitted to publicly display emissions labels to EU passengers.

Apostolos Tzitzikostas, Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, welcoming the partnership, says: “This decisive step turns Air France and KLM’s commitment to decarbonisation into concrete action.

“It reinforces fair competition, transparency, and trust. I encourage other airlines to join this initiative, driving a more sustainable and transparent future for European aviation.”

What can passengers expect from the Flight Emissions Label?

Once fully operational, the FEL will allow passengers booking with participating airlines to see a breakdown of their flight’s emissions performance.

Likened to food nutrition labels or appliance energy ratings, the scheme will generate a standardised, easily understood visual guide to the climate impact of a flight.

Air France-KLM is expected to begin displaying this data publicly in the coming months, subject to the completion of the trial phase.

The scheme is open to both EU and non-EU carriers operating flights in the region, provided they fall under the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation).

While the programme is voluntary for now, there is a potential that the FEL could become mandatory in future.

With mounting regulatory and consumer demand for greener operations, FEL may emerge as a global benchmark, especially as regions like Asia and North America evaluate similar frameworks to drive aviation decarbonisation.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/A-KLM-Airbus-A321neo.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 14:22:49.771734

Improved efficiency at the heart of a clean-sheet design Optimising aerodynamic efficiency is at the core of the A220’s airframe design.
To achieve this, the A220 boasts advanced features, such as the newly designed nose and tailcone, both of which reduce the drag on the aircraft.
The latest improvements for enhanced safety & performance Despite the integration of the latest technologies from the get-go, a clean-sheet design still requires continuous improvement to keep it at the forefront of innovation.
And the long-awaited capability to operate on 100% sustainable aviation fuel is expected to be possible for all Airbus aircraft before 2030.","Today, many of the planes flying our skies are test-proven aircraft – built on +40-year-old designs – that have been enhanced with the latest engine and avionics technologies.

However, every few decades, an aircraft comes along that boldly makes a fresh start. Most recently, that aircraft is the A220.

“With the A220, we really started from a blank slate,” explains Jean-François Parent, Airbus A220 Chief Engineer. “Our objective was to build the most efficient small single-aisle aircraft on the market, and we engineered – in a thoughtful way – the features that would deliver on this objective.”

Indeed, the A220 Family – comprising two variants: A220-100 and A220-300 – are “clean-sheet” aircraft built on an entirely new design that rethinks aerodynamic efficiency, allows for the use of the most advanced materials, and integrates the latest systems and avionics.

Because developing new aircraft is significantly more costly than simply improving an existing design, this approach is generally used when there is a need to serve new or different markets that existing designs can’t address. For the A220, that segment is the 100- to 160-seat market.

Improved efficiency at the heart of a clean-sheet design

Optimising aerodynamic efficiency is at the core of the A220’s airframe design. To achieve this, the A220 boasts advanced features, such as the newly designed nose and tailcone, both of which reduce the drag on the aircraft. The fuselage wetted area – which is the entire surface area that is in direct contact with the air – is the smallest for aircraft of its class, keeping drag at a minimum.

Among the A220’s most noteworthy innovations is its 40% use of advanced materials. The majority of aircraft are built from a combination of titanium, steel and aluminium. The A220 is no exception in this respect, but it also incorporates advanced composites – such as polymers and carbon fibre – in the wing, centre wingbox, empennage, rear fuselage and horizontal stabiliser. These composite materials are less prone to corrosion and fatigue compared to metal, and offer an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio. Case in point: the A220’s wing is 10% lighter than a conventional all-aluminium wing, which reduces fuel burn and emissions.

Inside the aircraft, the A220’s cockpit – designed by pilots for pilots – is widely appreciated for its modern and state-of-the-art flight deck powered by Airbus’ fly-by-wire technology. The simplified yet robust layout was designed to be as intuitive as possible with large screens, fewer manual controls and user-friendly on-board equipment – such as two-mode fly-by-wire flight controls and sidestick controllers. This cockpit layout enables pilots to fly the A220 Family’s two variants with the same type rating.

The A220’s engine and cabin have also been given the clean-sheet treatment with incredible results – improvements that will be explored more closely in future installments of the A220 web series.

The latest improvements for enhanced safety & performance

Despite the integration of the latest technologies from the get-go, a clean-sheet design still requires continuous improvement to keep it at the forefront of innovation. And the A220 has continued to integrate new features and functionalities since its launch.

For example, the A220-100 and A220-300 have consistently benefited from maximum take-off weight (MTOW) increases – approved by international regulatory authorities – throughout the years with the first increases starting in 2020. Since then, the A220’s MTOW has increased by 3 tonnes, which has expanded the aircraft’s maximum range. The latest payload increase is expected later this year.

Avionics upgrades are also a top priority for the A220. In 2026, the A220 will fully integrate the latest Runway Overrun Awareness and Alerting System (ROAAS), an onboard system that alerts pilots if more deceleration force is needed to avert a runway overrun. Because runway overruns are considered one of the major contributors to aircraft accidents worldwide, this improvement will further optimise safety by providing the flight crew with timely alerts when the aircraft is at risk of not being able to stop before the end of the runway. This upgrade will align with EASA’s mandate to have ROAAS integrated in all new commercial aircraft.

Further ahead, Airbus’ HBCPlus connectivity solution, which will significantly improve onboard broadband access, is expected to arrive after 2028. And the long-awaited capability to operate on 100% sustainable aviation fuel is expected to be possible for all Airbus aircraft before 2030.

Thanks to these innovations and Airbus’ continued investment in the programme, the A220 is solidifying its reputation as one of the most innovative aircraft with a clean-sheet design that delivers.

""The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,"" adds Marie.
The platform is hosted on IATA's Aviation Energy Hub, a centralised digital space designed to provide the aviation industry with access to practical tools that support aviation energy management.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has established the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matchmaker platform to help connect sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) between airlines and producers of the fuel.

It takes requests from aircraft and those with SAF who can offer a supply.

Once a match has been made, the airline and the supplier can then open discussions to reach specific terms including items such as price terms for payment, according to IATA.

This new platform offers support for items such as spot purchases and offtake agreements – it is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only.

However, the industry trade body has said that other participants, for example, non-aviation corporations, can take part in due course.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA's SVP Sustainability and Chief Economist, says: ""To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF.""

Addressing critical market challenges

IATA says the SAF Matchmaker platform will address what it describes as three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

This central platform will help to simplify the operation of SAF procurement by making it easier and quicker for parties to open discussions without any additional fees – which will help to further develop the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Helping to carry detailed information regarding available SAF – such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and the technology of production – as well as the emissions reductions plus the compliance with the ICAO CORSIA carbon scheme or the EU's Renewable Energy Directive.

Producers of SAF and suppliers will be given the opportunity to post available and planned SAF volumes, while airlines are able to register their interest in either purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes, with subsequent trades taking place outside the platform.

""The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,"" adds Marie.

The platform is hosted on IATA's Aviation Energy Hub, a centralised digital space designed to provide the aviation industry with access to practical tools that support aviation energy management.

Major partnership demonstrates SAF's growing importance

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is increasingly seen as crucial in reducing emissions within the aviation sector, potentially contributing to 65% of the required reductions to achieve net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association.

As part of this effort, FedEx, the world's largest express cargo airline, and Neste, a global leader in SAF production, have partnered to achieve a major milestone in sustainable transportation.

The pair have agreed on a substantial supply chain development at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), where FedEx will receive 8,800 tonnes of blended SAF—making it the largest SAF purchase by a US cargo line at LAX to date.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/17477459e70148fee359a7646383fbb5:82ccb0b059b40266e8abe3714defff38/planes-runway.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 11:09:47.085462

Each of these new arrivals in the coming nine years will further reduce average fuel consumption.
However, delivery delays, the BDL explains, are preventing German airlines from boosting their fleet renewal and fuel consumption reduction.","In recent years, airlines, airports, and other major aviation stakeholders have all been keeping a close eye on their fuel consumption. With the rollout of sustainable aviation fuel ( SAF) having been relatively slow thus far, and alternative means of propulsion such as hydrogen and electricity still in their embryonic phases, the best that most carriers can do now is look to reduce their use of conventional jet fuel.

This is an initiative that, in Germany, seems to be being carried out with a considerable degree of success, putting the country's airlines and airports in a good position as far as their progress towards meeting the industry's shared goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 is concerned. Indeed, one of the nation's leading interest groups recently revealed that German airlines are using less fuel than ever before.

Jet Fuel Use Is At An All-Time Low In Germany

Last week, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Luftverkehrswirtschaft ('German Aviation Association') proudly announced that jet fuel consumption at German airlines had reached a record low, averaging just 3.38 liters per passenger per 100 km (62 miles) in 2024. According to the BDL, a Berlin-based aviation interest group, this represents a 46% reduction compared to 1990's figure of 6.3 liters.

With carbon emissions per passenger having correspondingly been cut almost in half in the last 34 years, German carriers are certainly doing their bit when it comes to making the commercial aviation sector a more sustainable industry. According to the BDL, only 12% of respondents to a survey correctly guessed that the figure would be this low, with Dr Joachim Lang, its Managing Director, explaining that:

""Many people are surprised by how low the actual kerosene consumption of a flight actually is, and German airlines are improving their carbon footprint year after year. (...) Thanks to quieter engines, noise pollution is also significantly reduced, especially during takeoff and landing. This also benefits residents living near airports.""

Over 30% Of Germans Expected Consumption Levels To Be Nine Times As High

Diving into further detail regarding its survey concerning the average jet fuel consumption per passenger per 100 km in Germany, the BDL explains that ""31% estimated the average consumption at 30 liters,"" almost nine times as high as the actual figure of 3.38 liters. A similar proportion (around a third) were unable to provide an answer, with a further 23% putting 15 liters as their educated guess.

The BDL cites fleet renewal programs at German airlines as being a driving force behind the nation's impressive overall reduction in average fuel consumption. Indeed, Lang goes on to explains that ""replacing an older aircraft with a new model immediately reduces kerosene consumption and CO2 emissions by up to 30%.""

According to the BDL, Germany's airlines currently have a collective fleet of 830 aircraft. However, they are also investing in their future on a considerable scale, with the group explaining that they have also ""placed or reserved orders for 482 new aircraft with a list price of €82 billion ($96 billion) through 2034."" Each of these new arrivals in the coming nine years will further reduce average fuel consumption.

Long-Haul Aircraft Are Particularly Fuel-Efficient

While Germany's airlines averaged 3.38 liters of jet fuel consumption per passenger per 100 km in 2024, there are certain aircraft where this figure drops even lower. Most notably, widebody long-haul aircraft, where there are more passengers between whom to divide the fuel consumption, are the shining stars on this front.

According to the BDL, widebodies can sometimes be more than a liter better than the overall national average when it comes to jet fuel consumption per passenger per 100 km, with the group explaining that the most modern examples average between 2.1 and 2.5 liters. However, delivery delays, the BDL explains, are preventing German airlines from boosting their fleet renewal and fuel consumption reduction.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_1118464442-copy.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 11:10:00.192977

Yet across the country on the East Coast, Georgia has quietly emerged as a formidable competitor, rapidly consolidating its position as one of the premier aerospace hubs in the United States.

It’s hard to understate the importance of the aerospace industry, which contributes $57 billion and more than 200,000 jobs, to Georgia’s economy.

When thinking about aviation in Georgia, a couple of well-known names inevitably come to mind, such as Delta Air Lines, by some measures one of the world’s three largest airlines, and Atlanta-Hartsfield International Airport (ATL), the world’s busiest airport.

But, when it comes to aerospace, Georgia is also home to a strong industrial base, including household names such as executive jet manufacturer Gulfstream Aerospace and defense conglomerate Lockheed Martin, as well as another 800 companies.

Perhaps even more interesting is that as well as these well-established giants, a number of young companies active in the new emerging segments of aerospace have also set up shop in the state. We are talking about companies like Archer, which has built its first mass industrial plant in Convington, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) producer LanzaJet, which has set up a 10-million-gallon-a-year plant in Soperton, and hypersonic aircraft developer Hermeus, which is based in Atlanta.

How Georgia is trying to attract more investment in aerospace

In the lead up to the Paris Air Show, which took place in June 2025, AeroTime spoke to Elizabeth Mclean, Assistant Director at Georgia’s Department of Economic Development, to learn more about the state’s strategy to continue growing its aerospace sector.

The nascent advanced air mobility industry is one of the segments targeted by this organization, which is tasked with attracting fresh investment to Georgia’s aerospace ecosystem.

Mclean explained how, on the back of Archer’s investment, Georgia’s Department of Economic Development recently published an advanced air mobility blueprint, a 20-page document that outlines concrete steps to help establish the state as a leader in the sector.

However, Mclean also highlighted that this interest in emerging segments of the industry does not mean neglecting investments in more traditional fields such as maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO). In fact, Georgia hosts the largest MRO operation in the US, run by Delta Tech Ops, and has also seen recent investments from the likes of Pratt & Whitney, which invested over $200 million at its Columbus facility in 2023, and Embraer Aircraft Maintenance Services (EAMS), which is building up its activities in Macon, Georgia.

The state relies on its educational ecosystem to keep all these ventures supplied with a pipeline of fresh talent. Mclean underlined the role that engineering powerhouses like Georgia Tech play in all this. For example, in May 2025, Georgia Tech signed a partnership with Altair, a Michigan-based technology firm which develops AI-driven simulation software for cutting edge aerospace design applications. This technology is being used, for example, to design JetZero’s revolutionary blended wing body airliner.

“It is a very diverse ecosystem,” Mclean said. “What actually sets us apart from other states with strong aerospace industries is that we have the whole spectrum of activities, from the HQs to manufacturing, MRO, you name it.”",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/shutterstock_2418961933-1-e1752578448911.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 11:10:11.627074

With a capacity to produce 1 million tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) annually—the largest such facility globally—Neste is uniquely positioned to capitalize on Asia-Pacific's regulatory mandates and airline commitments to slash emissions. This strategic asset, paired with partnerships like its landmark deal with DHL Express, underscores why investors should view Neste as a critical beneficiary of the SAF boom.

The Singapore Refinery: A Moat in Motion

Neste's Singapore refinery, completed in 2023 after a $1.5 billion expansion, is not just a production hub but a showcase of industrial-scale sustainability. Its 1 million tons/year SAF capacity (part of a total renewable fuels output of 2.6 million tons) relies on advanced feedstock processing, including waste cooking oil and residues. Over 90% of its raw materials are sustainably sourced, a compliance advantage as regulators tighten standards.

The refinery's role is further cemented by its proximity to key Asian aviation markets. A striking example is its $60 million SAF supply deal with DHL Express, delivering 9.5 million liters of neat SAF to power international cargo flights from Singapore Changi Airport through 2026. This partnership, one of Asia's largest SAF agreements to date, highlights Neste's ability to secure long-term contracts with major carriers.

Policy Tailwinds: Asia-Pacific's Regulatory Push

Regulatory momentum is the engine behind SAF demand. Singapore's mandate to blend 1% SAF into aviation fuel by 2026, with a target of 5% by 2030, directly aligns with Neste's Singapore operations. Regionally, the EU's ReFuelEU regulation—requiring a 2% SAF blend by 2025—is a catalyst for cross-border collaboration. Airlines like Singapore Airlines and Scoot are already using locally produced Neste SAF at Changi Airport, reducing reliance on imported fuel and meeting compliance targets.

Japan, Hong Kong, and India are also advancing SAF policies. By 2030, Asia-Pacific airlines aim to achieve 5% SAF adoption as part of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines' climate goals. Neste's early partnerships—such as with Japan's ITOCHU Corporation—position it to dominate these emerging markets.

The Investment Case: Scale, Partnerships, and ESG Appeal

Neste's moat lies in its first-mover advantage and operational scale. By 2027, its global SAF capacity will reach 2.2 million tons annually, with the Singapore refinery accounting for nearly half of this growth. This expansion is underpinned by $2.2 billion allocated for SAF projects through 2027, including hydrogen production upgrades to boost efficiency.

While Neste's EBITDA fell to €1.25 billion in 2024 from €3.46 billion in 2023—due to pricing pressures and competition—the fourth-quarter rebound in SAF sales signals stabilizing demand. Airlines' long-term commitments (e.g., DHL's multiyear deal) and the cost certainty of fixed-price contracts mitigate near-term risks.

Moreover, Neste's ESG profile is a magnet for impact investors. Its goal to reduce 20 million tons of CO₂ annually by 2030 aligns with global net-zero targets, while its carbon-neutral production aim by 2035 adds credibility.

Risks and Considerations

Feedstock supply remains a critical challenge. Current waste/residue feedstocks can meet near-term demand but will require innovation—like algae-based or power-to-liquid fuels—to scale further. Neste's R&D investments (e.g., partnerships with Finland's VTT Technical Research Centre) are addressing this, but execution risks persist.

Competitors like Shell, TotalEnergies, and regional players in China and India could intensify price wars. However, Neste's end-to-end supply chain expertise—from feedstock sourcing to airport distribution—creates a barrier to entry.

Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on Asia's Green Skies

Neste's Singapore refinery is more than a production site; it's a linchpin in the Asia-Pacific's shift to sustainable aviation. With mandates tightening and partnerships solidifying, the company's ability to scale SAF production at a time when demand is surging makes it a compelling investment. While short-term volatility exists, the long-term trajectory—driven by regulation and airline commitments—is unambiguously upward. For investors focused on ESG-aligned growth, Neste's dominance in the region's SAF supply chain offers a rare blend of scalability, profitability, and purpose.

Investors should monitor Neste's feedstock diversification progress and SAF pricing trends, but the strategic foundation is clear: this is a company building castles in the sky—and they're green.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-15 11:10:20.363087

Sustainable aviation fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel is a renewable aviation fuel providing a more sustainable alternative to conventional, fossil-based jet fuel. Using Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%** over the fuel’s life cycle, compared to using conventional jet fuel. Neste’s SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. SAF is certified for commercial use and can currently be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel before use. It works seamlessly with existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure. Today, Neste’s global SAF production capability is 1.5 million tons per annum, and it is set to grow to 2.2 million tons in 2027.

*) CORSIA is a recognized scheme offering a harmonized way to reduce CO2 emissions from international aviation to curb its impact on climate change. It was developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the implementation of CORSIA is currently in the first, voluntary phase. Once certified by an ICAO-approved sustainability certification scheme, SAF qualifies as a CORSIA Eligible Fuel (CEF) and can be used by an airline to meet the CO2 emission reduction allocation requirements under CORSIA.

By harnessing seawater, captured CO2, and renewable electricity, they aim to create a sustainable aviation fuel. Their innovative approach eschews traditional biomass and fossil resources, providing a promising alternative for reducing carbon emissions associated with air travel. This initiative is poised to challenge conventional aviation fuel production methods, reflecting a growing interest in sustainable energy solutions.

SeaO2’s current work follows previous announcements regarding similar initiatives in sustainable technology. Past discussions in related sectors have focused on the potential of alternative energy projects, though not always with a specific focus on aviation. Historically, fuel industry leaders have explored varying methods of CO2 capture and conversion, seeking scalable solutions. However, SeaO2’s integration of seawater as a primary resource is a distinct departure from past proposals, offering a unique angle on CO2 utilization and renewable energy. This strategic orientation could reshape conversations around future energy models.

How will this project produce aviation fuel?

The collaboration aims to capture CO2 from seawater and convert it into essential building blocks for aviation fuel. This initiative encompasses four focal areas, starting with establishing system requirements and exploring potential use cases. Subsequent steps involve refining SeaO2’s electrochemical technology to convert seawater into hydrogen and CO2 using advanced reactor designs. A final techno-economic analysis will gauge the project’s cost-effectiveness against traditional kerosene production methods, marking a significant step in transitioning toward a more sustainable aviation sector.

What is SeaO2’s approach to ocean-based CO2 removal?

SeaO2 has been pioneering an electrochemical process known as Direct Ocean Capture (DOC), intended to lower atmospheric CO2 levels by removing carbon dioxide from the ocean. Established in 2021, the company envisions removing 1 gigaton of CO2 by the year 2045. Unlike other methods, this process doesn’t rely on chemicals or external inputs, instead using electricity to facilitate CO2 extraction. The technology derives from Delft University of Technology research and aligns with emerging sustainable industrial practices.

“We envision a compact, modular approach to large-scale carbon removal,” SeaO2’s co-founder Ruben Brands stated.

This system’s adaptability allows integration with existing infrastructure, which may reduce costs and enhance scalability. Looking towards 2030 and beyond, SeaO2 plans to transform outdated oil and gas platforms into offshore carbon capture hubs, utilizing renewable energy sources such as wind power for their operations.

Moreover, SeaO2 frames captured CO2 not as waste but as a viable resource. It foresees applications across multiple sectors, converting carbon into various chemicals and fuels. These applications not only provide potential new revenue streams but also facilitate emissions reductions where limited alternatives exist. The utilitarian view of CO2 sets a transformative precedent for other industries looking to achieve emission reduction targets.

The trajectory for SeaO2 showcases a merging of technological innovation with practical resource management, holding the potential to shape the future environmental footprint of aviation and other sectors. Projects of this nature illustrate the viable intersection of economic pragmatism with ecological responsibility, reflecting a nuanced understanding of contemporary energy challenges.",https://finance.coin-turk.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/business-017-4.png,N,,2025-07-15 11:10:53.479907

The funding will support the development of a decentralised process to produce aviation fuel using seawater, renewable electricity, and captured CO2.

The project combines work in CO2 capture, electrochemical conversion, and catalysis to establish a method of fuel production that operates without biomass or fossil sources.

Producing aviation fuel from seawater and captured CO2

The project focuses on developing a process to produce aviation fuel from seawater and captured CO2, structured around four main areas. It begins with defining system requirements, use cases, and technical criteria for a viable water-to-e-SAF pathway.

The next phase advances SeaO2’s electrochemical technology to extract CO2 from seawater and generate hydrogen from ultrapure water. Captured CO2 is then converted into alcohols and olefins, core components of aviation fuel, using specialised reactor designs and catalysts.

Finally, a techno-economic analysis will assess the cost and scalability of the integrated process and benchmark it against conventional kerosene.

Ocean-based CO2 removal technology

Founded in 2021 by Ruben Brands and David Vermaas, SeaO2 is working to reduce carbon dioxide concentrations in the ocean, which in turn helps lower levels in the atmosphere.

Its goal is to remove 1 gigaton of CO2 by 2045 through a process called Direct Ocean Capture. This method passes seawater through an electrochemical system that removes CO2 before returning the treated water to the ocean, where it can absorb more CO2 from the air.

SeaO2 builds on technology developed at Delft University of Technology and Wetsus. The system operates without chemicals or external feedstock and relies fully on electricity, aligning with net-zero targets and electrified industry needs. It aims to offer a compact, modular approach to large-scale carbon removal using ocean-based systems.

Scaling vision

SeaO2 is expanding its Direct Ocean Capture (DOC) technology through a modular system designed for scale and integration. The units can be deployed across a range of water-pumping industries, including thermal power, desalination, and aquaculture, allowing for shared infrastructure and lower operational costs.

Looking ahead to the 2030s, SeaO2 plans to repurpose oil and gas platforms as offshore DOC hubs, combining them with offshore wind and geological storage. The captured CO2 can either be stored permanently as part of carbon removal strategies or used as feedstock for producing chemicals and fuels.

A valuable resource

SeaO2 also promotes the use of captured CO2 as a resource rather than a waste product. The carbon can be applied directly in sectors such as food, beverages, packaging, and agriculture, or converted into fuels and chemicals, including methanol, ethylene, alcohols, formic acid, formate, syngas, and urea. These uses support emission reduction in sectors with limited alternatives.",https://siliconcanals.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ruben-Brands-founder-of-SeaO2-Image-credit-SeaO2.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 11:11:04.029951

Cautions against overly burdensome controls that could disrupt supply, especially for limited supply products like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

Advocating for practical, transparent and recognised verification processes with stakeholder input and balanced roles for certification bodies and member states

Reforms to improve the EU Biofuels Database (UDB) for better traceability

Matti Lievonen, CEO of EcoCeres – which recently signed a multi-year SAF agreement with British Airways – argued that a credible verification system was fundamental to realising the EU’s ambitious climate and sustainability goals.

“As a producer committed to authentic waste-to-fuel pathways, we view rigorous certification not as a hurdle but as essential infrastructure for the renewable fuels market,” he said.

“Our position paper reflects our dedication to fostering a transparent, equitable, and fraud-resistant ecosystem for biofuels that benefits all stakeholders – from producers and policy makers to consumers and the environment.”

The main challenges to SAF certification and widespread adoption include high production costs, limited feedstock availability and sustainability concerns, complex and evolving regulatory frameworks and certification processes, and the need for significant infrastructure development and investment.

The UK Department of Transport issued SAF Mandate: Compliance Guidance in January.

Data on the sustainability of fuel supplied must be verified by an approved third-party verifier before certificates will be issued.

Raman Ojha, president, Shell Aviation said, “This moment marks a significant milestone not only for Avelia but for the aviation sector.
Avelia’s evolution from a single-supplier platform to a multi-supplier industry solution is a powerful demonstration of how collaboration, technology and innovation can accelerate the scaling of SAF.","Shell Aviation, Accenture and Amex GBT have announced expansion of their sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) solution, Avelia.

First unveiled three years ago, Avelia saw Shell Aviation supplying SAF into the aviation fuel network with a novel ‘book-and-claim’ mechanism enabling travellers to buy the SAF and, if it was not available at the departure airport, the SAF would instead be fed into another aircraft in an airport where it was available.

The new expansion sees Avelia “evolving to an industry solution with independent data hosting and a multi-supplier model”. In practice, this will mean that multiple suppliers will be accepted.

The partners are also investigating a BYOS (Bring Your Own SAF) model, enabling airlines to manage more of their SAF portfolio in Avelia, including SAF originally purchased outside of the Shell supply network as well as SAF that otherwise would have been tracked offline and not on a digital registry.

The intention is to increase the volume of SAF bought through the Avelia platform, “helping build credibility for book and claim at an industry level and accelerating SAF adoption”.

It will also provide companies with a clear, scalable pathway to credible business travel life cycle GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions reductions from aviation.

Although SAF is seen as essential for aviation to meet its net zero targets, according to IATA, in 2025, production is expected to reach only 2.1 million tonnes or 0.7% of total jet fuel production.

Avelia has established itself as the leading blockchain-powered ‘book and claim’ solution, helping companies to access the GHG benefits of SAF without being constrained by its physical availability at specific locations.

Shell Aviation, Accenture and Amex GBT announced that, as of 31 March 2025, more than 57 corporations and airlines had joined Avelia and over 900 retirements had been executed (use of SAF).

This contributed to the injection of over 33 million gallons of SAF into the existing global fuel network at 17 airports, equivalent to over 300,000 tonnes of CO2e abated, or the equivalent of 530,000 passengers flying from London to New York.

This week, Geelong Refinery successfully processed 10 tonnes of tyre pyrolysis oil alongside crude oil toproduce a full range of fuels and products. This follows the refinery processing a similar quantity of pyrolysis oil derived from waste plastic in May, demonstrating its capability to process at scale oils made from waste and the critical role the facility will play in Australia’s sustainable future.

The development is a significant step in plans to establish tyre-recycling in Melbourne. For this demonstration, the tyre pyrolysis oil was imported from Poland with appropriate approvals from the Australian Government – it is currently not available domestically.

Earlier this year, Viva Energy signed a memorandum of understanding with Klean Industries, a Canadian resource recovery and advanced recycling provider, to study the potential to create a tyre-recycling facility in Melbourne capable of processing up to 80,000 tonnes of used tyres per year.

The recycling facility proposed by Klean would extract three products from tyres: recovered carbon black (rCB), steel, and biogenic pyrolysis oil. Under the agreement, Viva Energy would take the biogenic pyrolysis oil for processing at Geelong Refinery, allowing it to create lower-carbon intensity fuels.

Viva Energy’s successful processing of tyre pyrolysis oil not only signals progress for Australia’s own sustainable fuel industry, but also brings the country in line with global efforts to advance circular economies.

Tyre pyrolysis oil is already recognised in the EU as a low-carbon alternative to traditional fuels and feedstocks. Australia currently does not recognise lower-carbon fuels made via co-processing, meaning the associated carbon reduction benefits cannot be claimed by Viva Energy’s customers.

That is something that could change with the right policy settings, according to Viva Energy Chief Strategy Officer Lachlan Pfeiffer.

“The refinery’s ability to process pyrolysis oil from both tyres and waste plastic demonstrates the versatility of our facility and our commitment to supporting a lower-carbon future,” Mr Pfeiffer said. “Viva Energy is proud to play a role in the production of lower-carbon fuels and products and reduce the number of tyres that go into landfill. The project can only proceed if the regulatory landscape encourages businesses to progress these important initiatives.”

It is a sentiment supported by Lina Goodman, CEO of Tyre Stewardship Australia, who said the processing of tyre pyrolysis oil at Geelong Refinery is a significant step forward in demonstrating the potential of end-of-life tyres as a valuable resource.

“Tyre pyrolysis oil is increasingly recognised internationally, particularly in the EU, as a low-carbon alternative,” she said. “We welcome initiatives that showcase the viability of these solutions at scale that extract value from end-of-life tyres and support the transition to a more sustainable, low-emissions future for Australia.”

Viva Energy’s successful refinement of tyre pyrolysis oil, produced using Klean Industries’ advanced thermal conversion technology, marks a significant milestone for the circular economy in Australia, according to Jesse Klinkhamer, Klean Industries Inc.

“This achievement not only confirms the quality and compatibility of our recovered oils with existing refining infrastructure but also demonstrates the commercial viability of converting end-of-life tyres into high-value, low-carbon fuels and chemicals. It's a crucial step forward in fulfilling Klean Industries’ vision of establishing a fully integrated resource recovery and low-carbon fuel production facility in Melbourne, Australia,” he said.

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBBA), which makes permanent or modifies key provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA) and scales back numerous energy tax incentives enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. This alert is a summary of certain general business tax, clean energy tax credit and international tax provisions of the OBBBA. All section references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

General Business Tax

Bonus Depreciation (Section 168(k) and (n))

Permanence. The OBBBA permanently reinstates 100 percent bonus depreciation under Section 168(k) for qualified property acquired after January 19, 2025.

Qualified Production Property. New Section 168(n) allows an immediate deduction for 100 percent of the cost of “qualified production property.” Generally, qualified production property is any domestic manufacturing, refining, agricultural production or chemical production facility the construction of which begins after January 19, 2025 and before January 1, 2029 and that is placed in service after July 4, 2025 and before January 1, 2031.

Domestic Research and Experimental (R&E) Expenditures (Section 174A)

Domestic R&E. The OBBBA restores immediate expensing of domestic R&E expenditures under new Section 174A for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. This reverses the five-year amortization requirement that took effect in 2022 under the TCJA. Section 174A does not allow expensing of amounts paid or incurred for the purpose of ascertaining the existence, location, extent or quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral (including oil and gas).

Capitalization. Capitalization and amortization of domestic R&E expenditures remains available upon election.

Business Interest Limitation (Section 163(j))

EBITDA Calculation Reinstated. The OBBBA permanently returns the limitation on business interest deductibility to an EBITDA-based formula, reversing the more restrictive EBIT-based test in effect since 2022. This change takes effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Ordering. The OBBBA provides that the Section 163(j) limitation is calculated prior to applying any interest capitalization provisions (subject to certain exceptions) and requires taxpayers to first apply their allowed business interest deduction against business interest that would otherwise be capitalized. This change takes effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Expansion of Qualifying Income for Publicly Traded Partnerships (Section 7704)

Clean Energy Expansion. The OBBBA expands the definition of “qualifying income” under Section 7704 to include income from the transportation or storage of certain clean fuels, production of electricity from certain clean sources and other energy-transition infrastructure.

Partnership Transactions (Section 707(a)(2))

Self-execution. The OBBBA confirms that Section 707(a)(2), which addresses disguised sales between partners and partnerships, is self-executing. This eliminates any ambiguity about the enforceability of the disguised sales rules with respect to disguised sales of partnership interests in the absence of final regulations.

Deduction for Qualified Business Income (Section 199A)

Permanence. The OBBBA makes permanent the 20 percent deduction for qualified business income.

Excess Business Loss Limitation (Section 461(l))

Permanence. The OBBBA makes permanent the limitation on excess business losses for noncorporate taxpayers, which was set to expire after 2028. Excess losses will continue to be converted into net operating losses carried forward to future years.

Qualified Opportunity Zones (QOZs) and Qualified Opportunity Funds (QOFs) (Subchapter Z)

QOZ Renewal. The OBBBA renews the QOZ program with new QOZ designations to be made on July 1, 2026 and each July 1st every 10 years thereafter. New QOZ designations will go into effect on January 1st of the year following the designation.

QOF Renewal. Similarly, new QOFs will be established with respect to newly designated QOZs. Investors in QOFs will be able to defer capital gains for up to five years. In addition, taxpayers will receive a partial basis step-up in their investment if their holding period is at least five years and recognize no gain if their holding period is between 10 and 30 years.

Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) Gain Exclusion (Section 1202)

Holding Period. Non-corporate taxpayers can exclude from taxable income gain on the disposition of QSBS if such stock was held for five years and certain other requirements are satisfied. The OBBBA changes the holding-period requirement for QSBS issued after July 4, 2025 to allow a 50 percent exclusion for QSBS held for three years, a 75 percent exclusion after four years and full exclusion after five years.

Cap Increases. For QSBS issued after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA increases the maximum gain that can be excluded from the disposition of QSBS of a single issuer from $10 million to $15 million. In addition, the maximum gross asset threshold for a C corporation to be a qualified small business increased from $50 million to $75 million. The increased amounts are indexed for inflation for subsequent years. These changes apply to QSBS issued after July 4, 2025.

Clean Energy Tax Credits

Clean Electricity Production and Investment Credits (Sections 45Y and 48E)

Wind and Solar. The OBBBA phases out the Section 45Y and 48E credits for wind and solar projects. Wind and solar projects that begin construction on or after July 5, 2026 must be placed in service by December 31, 2027 to qualify for the Section 45Y or 48E credit. Wind and solar projects that begin construction prior to July 5, 2026 are eligible for the Section 45Y or 48E credit under the rules that existed prior to the passage of the OBBBA.

Fuel Cells. The OBBBA adds qualified fuel cell property to the property eligible for the Section 48E credit at a 30 percent rate. Fuel cell projects are not subject to the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or the zero greenhouse gas emissions rate requirement. Fuel cell projects are not eligible for any credit adders.

Other Technologies. The OBBBA modifies the phase-out rules under Sections 45Y and 48E for non-wind and non-solar projects. For any such projects that begin construction in 2034 and 2035, the Section 45Y and 48E credits are subject to a 25 percent and 50 percent reduction, respectively. Any such projects that begin construction in 2036 or later will not qualify for the Section 45Y or 48E credit.

Domestic Content Adder. The OBBBA makes the domestic content percentage requirements under Section 48E consistent with those under Section 45Y for projects that begin construction on or after June 16, 2025. Prior to the passage of the OBBBA, the domestic content percentage requirement under Section 48E was 40 percent but under Section 45Y ranged from 40 percent to 55 percent depending on when construction began.

Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

Extension. The Section 45Z credit is extended by two years to include transportation fuel sold through December 31, 2029.

Feedstock. After December 31, 2025, transportation fuel must be exclusively derived from feedstock that is produced or grown in the United States, Mexico or Canada.

Emissions Rate. The emissions rate for a transportation fuel may not be less than zero; however, an exception allows negative emissions rates for fuels derived from animal manure. Further, the emissions rate shall be adjusted as necessary to exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use changes. Such amendments apply to emissions rates published for transportation fuel produced after December 31, 2025.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The value of the Section 45Z credit for sustainable aviation fuel is reduced from $1.75 to $1.00 for each gallon produced after December 31, 2025.

No Double Counting. To qualify for the credit, the transportation fuel must not be produced from a fuel for which the Section 45Z credit was allowable.

Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

Rate Parity. The base credit rate for carbon oxides captured from an industrial source and injected for enhanced oil or gas recovery or utilized is increased from $12 to $17 per metric ton so that it is equal to the base credit rate for permanent sequestration. Similarly, in the case of direct air capture facilities, the base credit rate for carbon oxides captured and injected for enhanced oil or gas recovery or utilized is increased from $26 to $36 per metric ton. Such increases apply to facilities or equipment placed in service after July 4, 2025.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

Wind Components. The Section 45X credit is terminated for wind components produced and sold after December 31, 2027.

Metallurgical Coal. Metallurgical coal that is suitable for the production of steel (regardless of whether production occurs inside or outside of the United States) was added as an applicable critical mineral. This change applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Phase-out. The phase-out of the Section 45X credit was modified so that the credit (other than with respect to metallurgical coal) is subject to a 25 percent, 50 percent and 75 percent reduction in 2031, 2032 and 2033, respectively. The Section 45X credit terminates for metallurgical coal after 2029 and for other applicable critical minerals after 2033.

Battery Modules. The definition of “battery module” was changed to require each module to be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.” This change applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Integrated Components. The OBBBA allows manufacturers to claim the Section 45X credit on multiple primary components that are integrated, incorporated or assembled into secondary components if (a) the primary components are produced in the same facility as the secondary components, (b) the secondary components are sold to unrelated persons and (c) at least 65 percent of the direct material costs to produce the secondary components are attributable to primary components that are mined, produced or manufactured in the United States. This change applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V)

Termination. The Section 45V credit is terminated for projects that begin construction after December 31, 2027.

Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) Rules

The OBBBA restricts taxpayers with connections to certain countries or foreign entities from claiming credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z and 48E. The FEOC rules largely relate to China, Russia, Iran and North Korea (as well as certain listed foreign persons and entities, which are not discussed below). In general, a taxpayer is prohibited from claiming credits under any one of the following circumstances:

The taxpayer is a “specified foreign entity.”

A specified foreign entity includes, among others, (a) the government of China, Russia, Iran or North Korea; (b) a citizen or national of one of those countries (provided that such person is not a U.S. citizen, national or resident); (c) an entity organized in, or having its principal place of business in, one of those countries; and (d) an entity owned more than 50 percent by persons described in clauses (a) through (c).

This restriction applies to the credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y and 48E for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 and to the Section 45Z credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

The taxpayer is a “foreign-influenced entity.”

A foreign-influenced entity includes an entity with respect to which (a) a specified foreign entity has authority to appoint board members or officers, (b) a single specified foreign entity owns at least 25 percent of such entity, (c) multiple specified foreign entities own at least 40 percent of such entity or (d) at least 15 percent of the debt of such entity is held by specified foreign entities.

Except in the case of Sections 45Q and 45Z, a foreign-influenced entity also includes an entity that made payments to a specified foreign entity in the prior taxable year pursuant to a contract, agreement or arrangement (e.g., a license) that allows the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise effective control over a project or the production of any components (Specified Foreign Entity Payments).

This restriction applies to the credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y and 48E for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 and to the Section 45Z credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

The taxpayer receives “material assistance” on a project from specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities.

A project is deemed to receive material assistance if the material assistance cost ratio for the project is less than the applicable threshold percentage. The threshold percentages increase over time and range from 40 percent to 90 percent depending on the year, credit and technology. The material assistance cost ratio is computed as a fraction, with the numerator equaling total direct costs attributable to manufactured products and components not manufactured by specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities, and the denominator equaling total direct costs attributable to manufactured products and components.

The Secretary of the Treasury is required to issue safe harbor tables by December 31, 2026 identifying total direct cost percentages attributable to manufactured products and components. Until the safe harbor tables are issued, taxpayers may rely on the percentages in the domestic content safe harbor tables in IRS Notice 2025-08, certifications from suppliers regarding direct costs and certifications from suppliers stating that manufactured products and components were not manufactured or produced by a specified foreign entity or foreign-influenced entity.

This restriction applies to the credits under Section 45Y and 48E for projects that begin construction after December 31, 2025 (on a project-by-project basis) and to the Section 45X credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

In addition, if a taxpayer makes Specified Foreign Entity Payments within 10 years after a project claiming the Section 48E credit is placed in service, the full amount of the credit claimed is subject to recapture. This restriction applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

International Tax

Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) (Now “Net CFC Tested Income” (NCTI)) (Section 904)

Rate. The OBBBA modifies the global intangible low-taxed income inclusion rules such that a corporation’s effective GILTI rate will increase from 10.5 percent to 14 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. This change preempts the increase in the GILTI rate to 13.125 percent that was scheduled to take effect.

QBAI. Currently, a taxpayer can effectively exclude 10 percent of a controlled foreign corporation’s qualified business asset investment (QBAI) from the taxpayer’s GILTI inclusion calculation. The OBBBA eliminates this QBAI exclusion for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) (Now “Foreign-Derived Deduction Eligible Income” (FDDEI)) (Section 250)

Rate. Similar to those modifications made to the GILTI regime, the OBBBA modifies the FDII rules such that a corporation’s effective FDII rate will increase from 13.125 percent to 14 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. This change preempts the increase in the FDII rate to 16.4 percent that was scheduled to take effect.

QBAI. Similar to QBAI with respect to GILTI, the OBBBA eliminates the QBAI exclusion for FDII for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) (Section 59A)

Rate. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the BEAT rate will increase from 10 percent to 10.5 percent. This change preempts the increase in the BEAT rate to 12.5 percent that was scheduled to take effect.

Tax Credit Transfers (Section 6418) Background The IRA made certain tax credits (including the section 45Y PTC and 48E ITC) transferable for cash on a one-time basis, subject to certain limitations.
Please see our prior client alert on the IRA tax credit transfer regime here.
[19] The bonus is not available for the section 48E ITC.","Client Alert | July 14, 2025

This update details changes made by the Act to the tax benefits for clean energy projects, including the new limitations on certain energy-related tax credits enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA).

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBBA or the Act),[1] which enacts significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax benefits available to clean energy projects. The text of the Act can be found here. Our prior alert on the tax highlights of the Act can be found here.

This alert provides further details regarding the changes made by the OBBBA to the tax benefits for clean energy projects, including the new limitations on certain energy-related tax credits enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA).[2]

Wind and Solar Energy (Sections 45Y and 48E)

Background

Before the OBBBA, qualifying wind and solar projects were eligible for a production tax credit (PTC) under section 45Y or an investment tax credit (ITC) under section 48E. Under the IRA, the section 45Y PTC and section 48E ITC were subject to phase-out following the later of 2032 or the year the Treasury Secretary determined that the annual greenhouse gas emissions (GGEs) from the production of electricity in the United States was equal to or less than 25 percent of a 2022 baseline. Our prior alert on the section 45Y and 48E credits can be found here.

Under pre-OBBBA IRS guidance (first issued in 2014), a wind or solar project that began construction would qualify for ITCs or PTCs if it was placed in service by the end of the fourth calendar year after the year in which construction began (assuming other applicable requirements are met).[3] Construction of a project was deemed to “begin” by the performance of physical work of a significant nature or by satisfying a safe harbor through payment or incurrence of at least five percent of certain project costs.[4] That pre-OBBBA IRS guidance contains rules governing the type of “physical work” that qualifies but specifically provides that “there is no fixed minimum amount of work or monetary or percentage threshold required to satisfy” the physical work standard.[5]

Projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026

Under the Act, qualifying wind and solar projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026 must be placed in service by December 31, 2027 to be eligible for ITCs and PTCs.

Projects that begin construction on or before July 4, 2026[6]

As of the date of this alert (July 14, 2025), the section 48E ITC and section 45Y PTC placement-in-service deadline is uncertain for qualifying wind and solar projects that began construction before July 4, 2026 and thus are exempt from the December 31, 2027 placement-in-service deadline.

This uncertainty stems from President Trump’s July 7, 2025 Executive Order that directed the Treasury Secretary, by August 18, 2025, to “strictly enforce the termination of the [section 48E ITC and section 45Y PTC] for wind and solar facilities,” which includes

issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the ‘beginning of construction’ are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.

Both the scope of the Executive Order and the manner in which it will be interpreted are unclear, and we will publish another alert once this guidance is issued.

Certain Leasing Arrangements

For taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA prohibits the section 48E ITC for qualified investments in certain small wind facilities (used in connection with a residential dwelling unit by the lessee) if the taxpayer rents or leases the facilities to a third party, and disallows the section 45Y PTC with respect to electricity produced by such facilities during those taxable years.

Application of the prohibition is uncertain with respect to facilities generating electricity from solar energy. The heading of the provision states that it applies to “solar leasing arrangements,” but the prohibition by its terms (and a potentially errant cross-reference) applies to solar water heating property, which is not eligible for either the section 48E ITC or section 45Y PTC in the first instance.

Foreign Entity of Concern Rules (FEOC)

The OBBBA also introduces new section 48E ITC and section 45Y PTC eligibility requirements that target certain foreign (e.g., China) ownership or influence with respect to benefited projects and participation in supply chains (collectively, “Foreign Restrictions”).[7] As discussed below, some or all of the restrictions also apply to various other credits.

More specifically, the section 45Y PTC and section 48E ITC are not allowed to a “specified foreign entity” (SFE) or a “foreign-influenced entity” (FIE), nor are they allowed with respect to a facility the construction of which receives “material assistance” from an SFE or an FIE. These three concepts are discussed in more detail below.

SFE: An SFE is defined to include the governments (including agencies and instrumentalities) of China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea; citizens or nationals of any of those countries;[8] entities or branches formed in or having their principal place of business in any of those countries; and controlled entities and subsidiaries of any of the above (determined on a more-than-50 percent equity ownership basis and regardless of jurisdiction of organization).[9] SFE status is generally determined as of the last day of the taxable year.[10]

FIE: An FIE is defined as an entity that meets any of the following tests: (i) an SFE has direct authority to appoint certain officers, (ii) an SFE has at least 25 percent equity ownership or, taken together with other SFEs, at least 40 percent equity ownership, (iii) one or more SFEs has issued at least 15 percent of the entity’s debt, or (iv) the entity made an “effective control” payment to an SFE during the previous year (discussed below). FIE status is determined as of the last day of the taxable year.

Effective Control: An entity makes an “effective control” payment if, during the previous taxable year, the entity made a payment to an SFE pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement that entitles the SFE (or a related party) to exercise “specific authority over key aspects” of the energy generation of the entity’s (or a related person’s) facility that are “not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt” that otherwise would determine FIE status. The OBBBA goes on to provide a broad list of contractual provisions (relating to amount and timing of electricity production, offtake arrangements, access to data, and facility maintenance and repair) that convey impermissible authority to a counterparty. The OBBBA is especially scrutinous of intellectual property licenses (other than qualifying bona fide sales)—for example, any such arrangement (relating to a facility) that is entered into after July 4, 2025 is deemed to convey effective control to the SFE.[11]

Material Assistance: A facility receives “material assistance” from an SFE or FIE if an impermissible amount of the total direct costs of the manufactured products (including components) incorporated into the facility upon completion of construction are mined, produced, or manufactured by an SFE or an FIE. Pending receipt of Treasury guidance contemplated by the Act, taxpayers may rely on certifications from suppliers of manufactured products to determine if those products (or components) were manufactured by an SFE or FIE; new penalties apply to false or inaccurate supplier certifications.[12] Stricter penalties (and an extended statute of limitations) apply to assessments in respect of credits disallowed for “material assistance” violations.

Special rules allow publicly traded entities to rely on publicly reported information to determine their SFE and FIE status.[13]

The SFE ownership, FIE, and “effective control” rules apply to credits claimed for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, and the “material assistance” rules apply to projects that begin construction after December 31, 2025.

The “effective control” payment rules are also backed up by a new section 48E ITC recapture rule, effective for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Under this rule, for the 10 years after a qualifying facility is placed in service, a section 48E ITC is subject to 100-percent recapture (i.e., no vesting) if the taxpayer (i) is allowed a section 48E ITC for any taxable year beginning after July 4, 2027 and (ii) makes a payment to an SFE (“with respect to a taxable year”) pursuant to a contract that entitles the SFE (or a related person) to “effective control” over any facility of the taxpayer or a related person.[14] The recapture tax is due in the year the “effective control” payment is made.

The OBBBA did not include a controversial proposed excise tax included in prior versions of the legislation that would have applied to wind and solar facilities (regardless of whether ITCs or PTCs were claimed) that incorporated certain components sourced from prohibited foreign sources.

Domestic Content Clarification

The Act aligns the thresholds for the domestic content bonus credit under the section 48E ITC with the domestic content thresholds under the section 45Y PTC by increasing the section 48E thresholds to match the section 45Y requirements. In an apparent drafting glitch made by Congress in the IRA, the domestic content thresholds were lower under section 48E as compared to the domestic content thresholds under section 45Y.[15] This change is effective for facilities the construction of which begins on or after June 16, 2025.

Depreciation

The Act does not affect the eligibility of solar or wind projects to claim preferential five-year accelerated depreciation.

Battery Storage (Section 48E)

Background

Before the OBBBA, qualifying energy storage projects were eligible for the section 48E ITC, subject to phase-out on the same timeline as wind and solar projects (discussed above).

OBBBA Changes

The OBBBA did not change the section 48E ITC eligibility timeline for battery storage projects.

The OBBBA subjects storage projects seeking the section 48E ITC to the Foreign Restrictions applicable to wind and solar projects (discussed above), albeit with stricter “material assistance” provisions.

Fuel Cells (Section 45V and 48E)

Background

Under prior law, fuel cells were eligible for credits under Section 48E only if those cells met the emissions requirements of that section. Because feedstocks for fuel cell projects typically produce GGEs, this often made eligibility for the section 48E ITC challenging.

OBBBA Changes

Qualifying fuel cell projects that begin construction after December 31, 2025 are now eligible for a new 30-percent ITC that exempts the projects from the IRA’s prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements and GGE requirements. The new ITC is not eligible for the domestic content and energy community bonuses made available under the IRA.[16]

The Act also moves up the commencement-of-construction deadline for the IRA’s 10-year credit under section 45V for the production of clean hydrogen (a fuel cell feedstock) from January 1, 2033 to January 1, 2028. The Foreign Restrictions do not apply to the clean hydrogen PTC. Our prior alert on the section 45V credit can be found here.

Clean Fuels (Section 45Z)

Background

Before the OBBBA, section 45Z provided a PTC for clean transportation fuel, including a higher credit rate for sustainable aviation fuel. This credit was not available for fuel sold after December 31, 2027

OBBBA Changes

The Act extends the clean fuel production credit by two years, with the result that eligible fuel sold until December 31, 2029 is eligible for this credit.

The Act also relaxes the lifecycle GGE rules for credit-eligible fuel produced after 2025 by excluding the effects of indirect land use changes from the lifecycle GGE calculation.

In an apparent negative reaction to Treasury and IRS guidance released earlier this year, the OBBBA also authorizes the Treasury Secretary to confirm that sales by a taxpayer to an intermediary are permitted if the taxpayer has reason to believe that the fuel ultimately will be sold to an unrelated person.[17]

The Act effectively introduces a new cap on the credit. As background, the credit’s rate is the product of a formula that reduces the credit by reference to a specific fuel’s GGE rate; before the Act, however, fuels with a negative GGE rate could have seen their credit rate increase over the headline statutory rate under the Code’s formula.[18] The Act prospectively limits the fuels for which negative GGE rates that can be taken into account to fuels from specific animal manure feedstocks (e.g., dairy, swine, poultry).

The Act also provides that, for fuel produced after 2025, the credit is available only for fuel derived exclusively from feedstocks produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. The Act also eliminates the enhanced credit rate for sustainable aviation fuel effective for fuel produced after December 31, 2025.

Certain of the Foreign Restrictions also apply to clean fuel PTCs. The SFE ownership prohibition applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, and the FIE prohibition (other than the “effective control” payment rules) applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

Nuclear (Section 45Y and 48E)

Background

Under current law, qualifying nuclear projects are eligible for PTCs under section 45Y or ITCs under section 48E.

OBBBA Changes

Under the Act, a bonus amount was added to the section 45Y PTC for certain nuclear facilities placed in service in metropolitan statistical areas that have (or, at any time after December 31, 2009, has had) at least 0.17 percent direct employment in nuclear-related sectors.[19] The bonus amount is available for qualifying projects that begin construction in taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

The Foreign Restrictions apply to ITCs or PTCs for new nuclear projects on the same timeline as wind and solar projects. For nuclear facilities placed in service before the IRA and claiming the section 45U PTC, the SFE prohibition applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, and the FIE prohibition (other than the “effective control” payment rules) applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Sequestration (CCUS) (Section 45Q)

Background

Prior to the OBBBA, section 45Q provided a tax credit of $60 per metric ton for qualified CCUS facilities that captured qualified carbon oxides (QCOs) and either “utilized” (e.g., used in a commercial process) the QCOs or used the QCOs for enhanced oil and gas recovery. Qualified CCUS facilities that stored QCOs in secure geological formations were eligible for a higher credit of $85 per metric ton.[20]

OBBBA Changes

The OBBBA increases the section 45Q credit for QCOs that are “utilized” or used in enhanced oil or natural gas recovery to equal the credit rate for QCOs that are stored in secure geological formations. The credit rate increase applies to equipment placed in service after July 4, 2025

The SFE ownership prohibition and the FIE prohibition (other than the “effective control” payment rules) apply to CCUS projects for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

Background

The IRA made available a tax credit for the production and sale of certain eligible solar, wind, and energy storage components manufactured in the United States, as well as the production of certain critical minerals. The credits (other than the credits for critical minerals) were subject to a phaseout beginning in 2030.

OBBBA Changes

The Act introduces a new category of credit-eligible critical minerals—metallurgical coal suitable for use in the production of steel, regardless of where produced. The metallurgical coal credit is 2.5 percent of qualifying production costs (as compared to the 10 percent credit for other critical minerals).

The credit for wind components is terminated for components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. The Act phases out the credit for critical minerals (other than metallurgical coal) starting in 2031 and terminates the new credit for metallurgical coal produced after December 31, 2029.

The Act also revises the definition of credit-eligible battery module production to require inclusion of all essential equipment necessary for battery functionality.

The Foreign Restrictions are made applicable to section 45X but are generally applied to the production of components (rather the construction of the facility) and are subject to separate “material assistance” thresholds.

These changes are effective for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

The OBBA did not adopt an earlier Senate proposal to prohibit claiming multiple credits (or “stacking”) for the production of components that are integrated into and sold as a single product but did add new requirements to qualify for such stacking. To be eligible for stacking, the components must be produced at the same facility, the end product must be sold to an unrelated person, and at least 65 percent of the direct material costs of the underlying components must be attributable to United States mining, production, or manufacturing. This change is effective for components sold during taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

Tax Credit Transfers (Section 6418)

Background

The IRA made certain tax credits (including the section 45Y PTC and 48E ITC) transferable for cash on a one-time basis, subject to certain limitations. Please see our prior client alert on the IRA tax credit transfer regime here.

OBBBA Changes

The Act largely leaves intact the tax credit transfer regime introduced by the IRA; for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, however, an SFE cannot buy section 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, or 48E credits.[21]

New Classes of Qualified Income for Publicly Traded Partnerships (Section 7704)

Background

Publicly traded partnerships are generally taxed as corporations unless they derive at least 90 percent of their income from certain qualifying sources. Prior to the OBBBA, qualifying sources were limited to passive income and income from certain fossil fuel-related energy or transportation activities.

OBBBA Changes

The Act expands the definition of “qualifying income” to include income derived from qualifying hydrogen storage and transportation; electricity production from qualifying nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal facilities; carbon capture facilities, including electricity production from qualifying facilities with sufficient carbon capture; and thermal energy from hydropower and geothermal facilities.

The amendment is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Why Does the Navy Need a Heavy Lift UAV?

The Navy is inquiring about an unmanned heavy lift aircraft to sustain combat effectiveness in future wars by ensuring logistics can reach small, dispersed and vulnerable forces in denied or degraded environments without putting humans or high-value assets at risk. Other priorities include better supporting distributed maritime operations, operating in contested environments, reducing the logistics footprint and bridging capability gaps.

The Navy is wasting no time preparing contract awards for this effort. Naval Air Systems Command, or NAVAIR, is considering awarding an other transaction agreement for ULS-A in FY 2026.

Let’s dive into the potential offerors for this highly-anticipated program.

Phenix Solutions Ultra 2XL

Phenix Solutions of Oregon has developed a heavy-lift dual coaxial rotor UAV that is capable of carrying more than 1,300 lbs, a company official told ExecutiveGov. The platform can use an enclosed payload container or a sling to carry its payload beneath the aircraft.

The Ultra 2XL can carry varying payload amounts depending on fuel levels and total payload. The Ultra 2XL can perform ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore and shore-to-shore logistics missions.

The company is promoting the Ultra 2XL as providing an existing and proven Technology Readiness Level-8 vehicle designed for use as a tactical unmanned resupply aircraft. The platform can perform multiple military and civilian missions beyond visual line of sight and its mission modules can be quickly reconfigured in the field if mission requirements change.

Phenix Solutions was awarded the Next Generation Logistics Unmanned Aircraft System Phase I contract specifically focusing on heavy lift aircraft, vertical replenishment logistics and ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore cargo delivery. Phenix was also selected as an original equipment UAS manufacturer for an important U.S. Marine Corps program—Medium Air Resupply Vehicle-Expeditionary Logistics, or MARV-EL, Phase I, which has similar requirements to ULS-A.

The company is in the process of submitting for the next phase of MARV-EL and expects a contract decision to be made by the end of the year.

Near Earth Autonomy RUC-60

Near Earth Autonomy is developing an optionally-piloted aircraft based on the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter that has been in service with the DOD for generations. The platform is being promoted as performing logistics missions in contested environments and can carry 2,500 lbs 125 n miles, a company official told ExecutiveGov.

Near Earth Autonomy believes retrofit kits are the most efficient way to rapidly address the need by upgrading existing aircraft into uncrewed logistics solutions. The company is also developing retrokit solutions for the AgustaWestland AW139, the Kaman KARGO UAV and the TRV-150 quadcopter.

The Army in April awarded Near Earth Autonomy a $15 million contract to retrofit UH-60Ls with its advanced autonomy kits to make the helicopters uncrewed and high-tempo logistics aircraft. The initiative creates a repeatable and scalable process and allows the Army to avoid long acquisition timelines and unlock new capabilities from legacy aircraft.

Near Earth Autonomy highlights its Captain deterministic autonomy architecture as central to this program. Designed for performance in complex and degraded environments, Captain enables safe flight and hazard avoidance without needing onboard crew, a remote pilot or a continuous data link. Near Earth Autonomy is leveraging a modular open systems approach, or MOSA, for this UH-60L retrofit contract.

The Army will work with Near Earth Autonomy to develop new operational procedures for autonomous logistics by performing a series of autonomous flights. This should lead to a mature, mission-ready product. Near Earth Autonomy began working toward an unmanned Black Hawk in 2021.

Sabrewing Aircraft Rhaegal

Sabrewing Aircraft is developing a regional cargo unmanned aircraft capable of carrying up to 5,400 lbs of payload over 1,000 n miles in vertical takeoff and landing, or VTOL, mode. If a customer prioritizes larger payload capacity for the Rhaegal, the horizontal runway takeoff and landing permits up to 10,000 lbs of payload, according to Sabrewing’s website.

The Rhaegal achieved its first hover flight in 2022 while lifting 829 lbs. The company touts the Rhaegal’s ability to use sustainable aviation fuel to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 percent.

Sabrewing has landed a number of contracts, including one from Ameriflight, who intends on purchasing 35 Rhaegals. Ameriflight intends to use the platform to enter new business opportunities in distribution center logistics as part of a diversified aviation services business model.

Piasecki Kaman KARGO

Piasecki Aircraft made a huge splash earlier this year when it acquired the KARGO heavy lift quadcopter UAV from Kaman Air Vehicles, developer of the K-Max TITAN heavy lift helicopter. The KARGO is a medium-lift, autonomous UAV that has been demonstrated to both the U.S. Marine Corps and Army for its VTOL cargo capabilities. The platform has a payload capacity of 1,000 lbs with a range of up to 500 n miles, according to Defense News.

The KARGO is designed to fit in a standard shipping container and can be unloaded and operated by as few as two people. Kaman, while owning the KARGO UAV program, received an initial $12 million contract from the USMC for MARV-EL and has two existing full-scale prototypes, according to a company statement.",https://media.executivegov.com/2025/07/heavy-lift-uav-navy-logistics-ulsa.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 18:08:29.463359

This initiative aims to boost the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by welcoming more fuel suppliers into its blockchain-powered system. The partners believe this evolution will make SAF accessible to a wider audience, potentially stimulating more environmentally conscious choices in air travel, even if availability remains limited at certain airports.

Before this development, Avelia had launched in 2022 offering 1 million gallons of SAF, initially sourcing only from Shell Aviation. Now, with over 57 companies and airlines on board, Avelia has injected over 33 million gallons of SAF across 17 global locations, cutting down more than 300,000 tonnes of CO2e when compared to traditional jet fuel. Previous estimations on SAF production indicated that by 2025, it would comprise a mere 0.7% of all aviation fuel consumption. This underlines the pressing need for platforms like Avelia to amplify SAF’s presence in the aviation sector.

Can Avelia’s Growth Transform SAF Accessibility?

The initiative’s expansion to a multi-supplier model is central to its strategy. This change allows participants to source SAF from various suppliers and consolidate their activities within Avelia. Shell, Accenture, and Amex GBT believe introducing more fuel suppliers will strengthen the platform’s credibility and impact. Furthermore, the “Bring Your Own SAF” feature aims to offer airlines more control over their SAF portfolios, even for fuel acquired outside the current supply network.

How Is Technology Enhancing Avelia’s Objectives?

Blockchain technology is pivotal in Avelia’s enhancements. Accenture now manages the platform’s data, ensuring a secure, transparent, and externally verified system. By doing so, Avelia seeks to foster trust among participants and encourage broader adoption within the industry.

Industry experts have expressed optimism about these updates. Evan Konwiser of Amex GBT highlighted the platform’s capacity to mitigate Scope 3 emissions for companies, underscoring its role in advancing the first and most established book-and-claim SAF system. Shell’s Raman Ojha noted this moment as significant not only for Avelia but also for the wider aviation sector.

Meanwhile, Accenture’s Dr. Jesko-Philipp Neuenburg emphasized the importance of strategic partnership in elevating the platform’s capabilities and maintaining data transparency. By leveraging blockchain and fostering a collaborative environment, Avelia aligns itself with the aviation industry’s sustainability goals.

Avelia’s recent advances highlight the strategic marriage of technology and sustainability. As aviation continues grappling with its environmental footprint, platforms like Avelia represent proactive efforts to confront these challenges. Despite its potential, ongoing collaboration and technological refinement will be crucial to overcoming existing barriers and facilitating broader SAF usage across the sector.",https://finance.coin-turk.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/business-003-3.png,N,,2025-07-14 17:07:07.264377

Mandell participated in a keynote fireside chat at the Reuters Global Energy Transition Conference in New York City last month, discussing integration across the Phillips 66 value chain and how it helps the company pursue lower-carbon opportunities.
The discussion also included a new partnership as an example of how Phillips 66 is unlocking that value.
The airline has received 5 million gallons of neat SAF from Phillips 66 through June at Los Angeles International Airport.
“We’re historically a traditional energy company, but our view is that we need all forms of energy.”","Phillips 66’s integrated model uniquely positions the company for success in the energy transition, Phillips 66 EVP of Commercial and Marketing Brian Mandell said recently. Mandell participated in a keynote fireside chat at the Reuters Global Energy Transition Conference in New York City last month, discussing integration across the Phillips 66 value chain and how it helps the company pursue lower-carbon opportunities. The discussion also included a new partnership as an example of how Phillips 66 is unlocking that value.

“What’s interesting about our integrated system is you can take assets and leverage them for new opportunities,” Mandell said. “We’re focused on both traditional energies and also emerging energies, particularly renewable fuels.”

Mandell mentioned Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as an example, announcing a new deal with British Airways. The airline has received 5 million gallons of neat SAF from Phillips 66 through June at Los Angeles International Airport. The deal joins a growing list of other agreements the company has recently made.

“We were the first refinery in the UK to produce SAF at scale, and in 2022, we did a deal with British Airways to sell them that product,” Mandell said. “Last year we announced a deal with United at Chicago O’Hare International Airport.”

Setting Phillips 66 apart

Mandell also highlighted the transformation of the company’s San Francisco refinery, which now runs 50,000 barrels a day of feedstock.

“We saw an opportunity to convert that refinery into a renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel refiner,” said Mandell, referring to the renamed Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex. “Rodeo is part of our newest segment, our renewables segment, and is a great example of how we are evaluating opportunities for lower-carbon solutions.” Part of Phillips 66’s integrated model also includes a commercial organization that focuses on “finding the right feedstock, the right price, at the right time to make sure what the plant needs, we have,” Mandell said.

Mandell explained that optimizing plants by running the best suited feedstock is how Phillips 66 unlocked other opportunities. This allows for the most efficient slate for a refinery while staying customer-centric.

Mandell provided an example of California’s desire for renewable diesel, where Phillips 66 supplies over 600 76® branded stores. “Our integrated model can take renewable diesel to the end consumer. We’re constantly trying to get the product all the way through that last mile.”

Collaboration is necessary

Effort by various stakeholders is needed to continue the development and implementation of renewable fuels, said Mandell. Using SAF as an example, he noted it is difficult to invest and innovate with changing policies, thus calling for more collaboration.

“We’re going to need airlines, shippers, airports, producers and the government to all work together to develop [the SAF] market,” said Mandell. “We’re historically a traditional energy company, but our view is that we need all forms of energy.”",https://www.phillips66.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/BAYWAYSTILLS0060.png,N,,2025-07-14 16:09:53.545970

While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn’t as favorable as it was just a few years ago.
Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.
It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.
But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.","Congress’ passage of President Donald Trump’s spending and tax cuts bill this month could help grow the market for sustainable aviation fuel, a nascent industry that could be a boon for corn-producing states as airline operators are betting on it to decarbonize the sector.

The Republican budget reconciliation law that Trump signed July 4 pared back some of the credits for sustainable energy in the law that congressional Democrats passed and President Joe Biden signed in 2022 — the Inflation Reduction Act.

But the recent law extended one energy tax credit for producing clean fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, an alternative to the typical jet fuel planes use. The credit initially went through 2027, but the GOP law extends it through 2029.

Advocates for sustainable aviation fuel had been pushing Congress to extend the tax credit to support production as states across the U.S. have passed or proposed their own tax credits to grow the sector and lure production within their borders. Lawmakers in Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and New York have introduced bills enacting tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

For airlines, increasing availability of the fuel is essential for the sector to meet its net-zero goal for 2050, with the International Air Transport Association estimating the cleaner fuel could get the industry 65% of the way toward its target.

“We’re not yet at commercial-scale production and you need that longer lead time for these types of projects so I think the extension is really key,” said Chris Bliley, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Growth Energy, a biofuel industry group.

While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn’t as favorable as it was just a few years ago. The new budget reconciliation law also included provisions to lower the credit amount for sustainable aviation fuel specifically and clawed back unobligated grant funding to support the sector.

The amount of sustainable aviation fuel that producers make today is far from how much the airline industry needs to be able to use the alternative fuel regularly. U.S. production capacity over the last couple of years, however, has grown, jumping from less than 5,000 barrels per day at the start of 2024 to more than 30,000 by February of this year, according to a May report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Badger State bill

Wisconsin state Rep. David Steffen, a Republican who sponsored a bill to incentivize sustainable aviation fuel, said he learned about a sustainable aviation fuel production company based in Madison called Virent Inc., now a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp. Virent’s fuel helped power the first domestic flight powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its engines.

“I was intrigued that we had this company in our state and I want them and other companies of similar interest to find Wisconsin as their new home,” Steffen said. “It’s a great opportunity for not only the environmental benefits that come with it but for our farmers, dairies and timber producers to access a brand-new market for their product.”

Steffen’s bill also requires that to receive the tax credit, source materials for the fuel must be domestically sourced.

Wisconsin’s legislative session doesn’t end until next March and Steffen said he’s “very comfortable in saying (the bill) will have a clear path to the finish line.” Should it pass in its current state, the tax credit would go into effect in 2028.

Other states

Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and Washington state all already have enacted laws to provide tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

Lawmakers in New York and Michigan have also proposed legislation to create their own tax credits. The New York bill barely moved in the most recent session, while legislation in Michigan has made it out of one committee and been referred to a second.

New York state Sen. Rachel May, a Democrat, plans to re-introduce the legislation next year. She said she wants to amend her bill to offer a larger tax credit for companies making sustainable aviation fuel specifically by mimicking photosynthesis so it doesn’t incentivize diverting feedstock like corn from being used for food, she said.

Her concern is moving the agriculture industry “away from both food production and maybe what might be the best uses of the land,” she added.

Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.

And Washington state's support for sustainable aviation fuel goes beyond tax incentives.

Washington State University is globally the top contributing organization to scientific literature in the sustainable aviation fuel field, based on an analysis of articles, papers, editorials and news items published between 2001 to 2023. Joshua Heyne, director of the Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Laboratory (BSEL) at WSU Tri-Cities and co-director of the WSU-PNNL Bioproducts Institute, was the most cited author.

At the end of 2024, SkyNRG Americas Inc. announced its proposal to build on property purchased from the Port of Walla Walla near the Columbia River for a sustainable aviation fuel production facility. The project has also received a $1.5 million grant from the state Department of Commerce, as part of the Governor’s Economic Development Strategic Reserve Fund.

Federal extension

While the extension of the federal clean fuels tax credit could be beneficial to the sustainable aviation fuel industry, the new law also lowers the amount of the tax credit for the fuel. It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.

One version of the budget reconciliation bill also called for extending the tax credit by four years instead of two, but that got scaled back in the version of the bill ultimately signed into law.

The new law also took away any funding not yet obligated as part of a grant program for sustainable aviation fuel and makes fuels derived from feedstocks that come from outside the U.S., Canada or Mexico ineligible for the tax credit.

Despite any limitations, some analysts expect the law will still boost sustainable aviation fuel.

“The Trump administration has yet to outline its approach to SAF, but we expect the fuel to benefit from the administration’s focus on supporting biofuel-producing states,” analysts for Capstone DC, a firm that advises business clients on policy issues, said in a note in late June.

But changes to the federal tax credit could also make states more interested in adopting their own credit to support sustainable aviation fuel, Capstone added.

‘Not nearly as strong’

Tariffs, meanwhile, could also make U.S. feedstocks for producing the fuel more competitive, Paul Greenough, a vice president on Capstone’s energy team.

But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.

“Momentum still exists for SAF but it’s not nearly as strong as it was under the Biden administration,” he said.

Some climate groups have also expressed concern over changing the clean fuels tax credit at the federal level. The Clean Air Task Force, ahead of the bill becoming law, said extending the credit will largely service other fuels that aren’t sustainable aviation fuel, which will in turn be costlier for the government.",https://www.tricitiesbusinessnews.com/ext/resources/2025/07/14/Airplane.jpg?height=635&t=1752513003&width=1200,N,,2025-07-14 15:10:08.055200
